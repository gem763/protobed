An ancient region with a rich and complex history, tourism there began during the Victorian era, in the mid-19th century, with the English aristocracy.\n\nToday, ornate estates and castles dot the landscape, many now visitable, some even hotels. The Scottish Highlands, about the size of Belgium, are sparsely populated, boasting the vast bulk of the U.K.\u2019s wilderness areas, and many, many sheep. The country\u2019s tallest peak, Ben Nevis, at just over 4,000 feet, is also there. There are few places in the world that are both as charming and adventure-filled as the Highlands.\n\nOccupying the top cut of the U.K., the Highlands are dominated by several ancient mountain ranges. During the Pleistocene period millions of years ago, the whole landscape was blanketed with glaciers, which left in their disappearance dramatic gashes in the landscapes, which now form the Highlands\u2019 many deep lochs and wide valleys. It is a place of dramatic weather, too, with lots of rain and wind and, in the winter, snow.\n\nThe intense climate is why many of its mountains and hills are barren of trees, giving the landscape a somewhat lunar appearance. Its coasts are rocky and abundant with sea life, and there are many islands and small isles, some of which are populated. If you wish to really get away, try the Shetland or Orkney Islands.\n\nSTAY There are a number of exquisite hotels throughout the Highlands. Located in the Cairngorms National Park is Muckrach Country House, a wonderfully renovated Victorian-era shooting lodge with heaps of traditional Scottish charm and a splendid restaurant (try the locally caught langoustines).\n\nIn the charming village of Braemar, built right against the Clunie River, book a room at the Fife Arms, a Victorian inn recently restored in lavish style, with an impressive inventory of world-class artwork, including an original Picasso, and a gorgeous Art Deco bar.\n\nIf using the Scottish capital of Edinburgh as your jumping off or end point, have a stay at the Dunstane House, a 19th-century residence converted into a cozy, five-star boutique hotel, located in a quiet part of the city.\n\nCloser to the city center is The Bonham, another restored old residence, with a beautiful little dining area overlooking a pleasant park.\n\nIf passing through Inverness, the capital of the Highlands, Penta Hotel makes for a chic but quiet homebase. (Note: The hotel is not affiliated with Penta in any way.)\n\nWalkers on a track from the Lairig Ghru mountain pass (visible beyond) in the Cairngorms National Park. PTOMKINS/VIsitscotland\n\nPLAYFor the adventure seeker, the Highlands are a natural playground. From mountain biking to mountaineering and even world-class surf breaks and skiing, there is something for every kind of go-getter.\n\nFor a reputable operator with deep knowledge of the area\u2019s adventure offerings, check out Wilderness Scotland. It is Scotland\u2019s only five-star accredited adventure tour operator (longtime guide and surf addict Mark Cox comes highly recommended).\n\nMake time for Cairngorms National Park, or \u201cthe Gorms\u201d as locals call it, the U.K.\u2019s largest national park, a breathtaking playground. EXPLORE Make a stop at Culloden Battlefield, the site of a momentous battle during the 1745 Jacobite rising\u2013something like Scotland\u2019s Gettysburg\u2013with a fantastic museum. Nearby is Clava Cairns, stone tombs built around 4,000 years ago, but made famous by the TV series Outlander.\n\nThere are several castles to visit in the Highlands, but one which certainly impresses is Cawdor. Visitors can stroll the grounds and the art-filled rooms, as well as enjoy some tasty food in the restaurant.\n\nIn the Highlands city of Dundee is the newly opened V&A Museum of Design, a Scottish branch of the London-based institution of the same name.\n\nThe views in this part of the world are hard to beat. Just beware of some extreme weather, too. Wilderness Scotland\n\nEATVisitors to the Highlands are often pleasantly surprised by the quality of its food. An age-old agricultural region, long cut off from the rest of the country, the area is rich in locally sourced, fresh produce, meat and seafood.\n\nThe Flying Stag, the restaurant in the Fife Arms hotel, which has a taxidermied winged-deer above the bar, is fantastic, with seasonal Scottish classics like Orkney scallops and heather-smoked blue mussels. Anderson\u2019s Restaurant, in the small town of Aviemore, located within the Cairngorms National Park, is a delicious local spot with a focus on seasonal food.\n\nFor a truly unique experience, book a meal at the country home of Ghillie Bassan, an endlessly endearing Scottish cookbook writer with an eclectic, internationally-inspired style. Her home-cooked meals are paired with whiskys produced nearby, such as Glenlivet.\n\nIf in Edinburgh, Brasserie Prince, a newly opened French-Scottish restaurant from acclaimed chef Alain Roux, comes highly recommended. Try the British oysters.\n\nDRINK\n\nIn the Highlands, you see copious amounts of two things: sheep and whisky distilleries. One which provides a unique kind of experience is the new Macallan distillery, which opened last year. Its undulating, grass-covered roof, which blends seamlessly into a landscape of green rolling hills, covers an exceptionally modern and sleek operation, though the stills are exact replicas of its old distillery.\n\nAt the Fife Arms, be sure to grab a cocktail at Elsa\u2019s Bar, a splendid Art Deco masterpiece inspired by fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli. They know how to make a drink.\n\nThe writer was hosted by Wilderness Scotland.", "description": "The scenery is beautiful, the people friendly, and the whisky may just hit the spot", "authors": ["Brent Crane"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-118388/social", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
