Consumers need to be cautioned that stablecoins are likely to be starkly different from sovereign-issued currency in legal terms.\u201d\n\nThe global financial system and the digital currency race\n\nAside from her robust emphasis on consumer protections, Brainard also shared her detailed perspective on the potential stakes raised by Libra.\n\nThese encompass \u2014 but are not limited to, she noted \u2014 data security and privacy risks, a prospective impact on banks' sources of stable funding and central banks\u2019 implementation of effective monetary policy, and financial stability risks exacerbated by a \u201cpotential ambiguity surrounding the ability of authorities to provide oversight and backstop liquidity and to collaborate across borders.\u201d\n\nAs reported, analysts at RBC Capital Markets have recently warned that should U.S. regulators choose to \u201cultimately dismiss Libra,\u201d China's forthcoming central bank digital currency could become the de facto global digital currency in emerging economies.", "description": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s Lael Brainard says Libra could pose risks to consumers due to ambiguity over their rights", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMGI5NDc5NGFmOWQ0ZjczMjAyYTU1ZTQzNWE2OWIyOTMuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
