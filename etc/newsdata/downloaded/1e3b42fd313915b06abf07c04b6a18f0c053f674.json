REUTERS/Chris Helgren\n\nThe mood lifted the Australian dollar AUD=D3 to a six-week high of $0.6875 and the pound GBP=D3 also hit a six-week high of $1.2385 as a British law blocking a no-deal exit from the European Union came into force.\n\nThe safe-haven yen JPY=EBS touched a five-week low of 107.46 per dollar as risk appetite rose. Moves were modest in early Asian trade, however, with traders broadly remaining on the sidelines ahead of a key European Central Bank meeting on Thursday, at which policymakers are expected to ease monetary policy.\n\nInvestors also await Chinese inflation data due around 0130 GMT, which is expected to show another year-on-year decline in factory prices, adding to arguments for more central bank stimulus.\n\nRatings house Fitch on Tuesday cut growth forecasts for Europe and China citing rising protectionism.\n\nMarket hopes for a breakthrough rested on confidence overnight from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who told Fox television that there had been \u201ca lot of progress\u201d on a U.S-China trade deal and that the U.S. side was \u201cprepared to negotiate\u201d.\n\nTapas Strickland, a director of economics at National Australia Bank, said trade remained subdued with few drivers beyond Mnuchin\u2019s comments and the prospect of stimulus in Germany. However, the absence of any in immediately bad news for markets has helped sentiment.\n\n\u201cIt was largely a case of \u2018Hakuna Matata\u2019 for markets,\u201d Strickland said, referring to a Swahili phrase meaning \u201cno worries\u201d, made famous by the 1994 Disney film The Lion King.\n\nThe remarks pushed U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasuries US10YT=RR to a three-week high, where they held in early Asian trade.\n\nThe euro also rallied to as high as $1.0167 following a Reuters report that Germany may set up public investment agencies to boost fiscal stimulus without breaching national spending rules.\n\nSterling, meanwhile, barely shifted when Britain\u2019s parliament voted, as expected, to stymie Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s bid for an early election, which prompted him to vow that he would secure a Brexit deal at an EU summit next month.\n\nIt sat just below its six-week peak at $1.2344 at 0005 GMT.\n\n\u201cWhile I am loath to go anywhere near the pound, I like what I see in the price action,\u201d said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne forex brokerage Pepperstone Group.\n\n\u201cIf GBP/USD kicks up through $1.2354 again, I would be looking for longs, with a stop through $1.2234.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese yuan CNH= trod water in offshore trade to hold around 7.1140 per dollar ahead of the economic data.", "description": "The dollar drifted lower on Tuesday as investor appetite for higher risk currencies found support on a report of German stimulus plans, diminishing chances of a no-deal Brexit and hopes of a breakthrough in the Sino-U.S. trade war.", "authors": ["Tom Westbrook", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428140976&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF89023", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
