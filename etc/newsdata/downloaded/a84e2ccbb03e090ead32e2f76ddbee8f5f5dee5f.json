Advertising and marketing expenditure has jumped 12% so far this year, the company said.\n\nGatorade sales have been revived by a zero-sugar version of the sports drink, and PepsiCo said retail sales of the variant have surpassed half a billion dollars since the launch in May 2018.\n\n\"(Gatorade Zero) is capturing consumers that I think were very heavy users of Gatorade and abandoned the brand because of the calories,\" Laguarta said on a conference call with analysts.\n\nOverall beverage sales in North America rose 3.4% in the third quarter to $5.64 billion, also supported by its Bubly sparkling water brand.\n\nPepsiCo has launched Bubly in fruity flavors, and Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston told Reuters that he expects it to become the company's next billion-dollar brand, with sales rising \"dramatically\" after a Super Bowl ad earlier this year.\n\nThe company's major snack brands, Doritos and Cheetos, also got a lift from the marketing push, at a time when calorie-counting Americans increasingly shift toward healthier options.\n\nJohnston attributed the rise to on-the-go lifestyles.\n\n\"With busier lifestyles (there) comes a desire to eat more conveniently, which is a strong tailwind for our business\".\n\nPepsiCo said it expects to meet or exceed its fiscal 2019 organic revenue growth target of 4%. However, the heavy spending on advertising and manufacturing came at a cost.\n\nThe company's net income attributable fell 16% to $2.10 billion and it left its full-year core earnings per share forecast unchanged.\n\nThe profit forecast suggested that the cost of achieving revenue growth was rising, according to Wells Fargo analysts.\n\nNet revenue rose 4.3% to $17.19 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $16.93 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nExcluding one-time items, the company earned $1.56 per share, beating the average estimate of $1.50.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Uday Sampath in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)", "description": "Since taking the helm last October, Chief Executive Officer Ramon Laguarta has carved out a multi-billion dollar strategy, which includes partnering with celebrities such as Chrissy Teigen and ramping up manufacturing capacity for smaller cans, to boost demand for out-of-favor sugary sodas.
