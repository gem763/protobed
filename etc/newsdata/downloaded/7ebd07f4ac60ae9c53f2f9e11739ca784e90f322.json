There are still writers all over the country that have a legitimate love for the Husker fan base.\n\nThat love was laid out by one Penn State writer in the Altoona Mirror. The writer, Neil Rudel, laid out how much he enjoyed the rivalries in the Big Ten.\n\nHe took a look at those rivalries from the viewpoint of someone who travels quite a bit and has spent plenty of time in opponents' stadiums. When all was said and done, Rudel had an obvious favorite, and that was the Nebraska football team.\n\nLoving on the Huskers\n\nRudel started his reasoning behind his love of Nebraska by comparing it to Penn State. \"It has as much in common with Penn State as any other team in the Big Ten in that Lincoln is a neat college town (albeit with not the easiest travel access, like PSU) and also boasts a proud and accomplished tradition recognizing the Cornhuskers\u2019 national championships.\"\n\nHe added that PSU and Nebraska have the fact they left their more familiar homes to join the Big Ten (mainly for money).\n\nHe then went on to explain that in his experiences, Nebraska's fans are the classiest in the entire conference.\n\n\"I had heard about their graciousness before but was still stunned and impressed to see them form a tunnel to the visitors\u2019 tunnel to applaud their guests. I have only seen Penn State lose in Lincoln several times, but I\u2019m told the fans do the same after the Cornhuskers suffer a home defeat.\"\n\nRudel added he heard there were Cornhusker fans who actually traveled to the Lincoln airport to welcome the Ohio State Buckeyes to town.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

NFL\n\nIt isn't the first time a reporter has talked about those airport greetings, though Rudel called it \"above and beyond the call.\"\n\nPenn State vs Nebraska football history\n\nWhen the Huskers joined the Big Ten, there was plenty of excitement about getting to play the Nittany Lions more often. That hasn't really come to pass. The two teams did square off the first three years the Huskers were in the Big Ten The first matchup between the two sides marked one of the first games Penn State played after revelations about former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky came to light.\n\nNebraska won all three games when they joined the conference but has played just once since the end of the 2013 season.\n\nThat game, a 56-44 loss in 2017, was widely considered the final nail in Mike Riley's coffin as head coach for Nebraska football.\n\nThe Huskers will reopen the series (which they currently lead 9-8) against Penn State next year in Lincoln. They will then go another four years before they take on PSU again.\n\nSuch is the way things pan out in a conference with two divisions.", "description": "Neil Rudel of the Altoona Mirror holds a special place in his heart for Husker fans when it comes to class", "authors": ["Zeegee Cecilio", "Read More On The Same Topic Oliver Vandervoort", "Nebraska Football", "Darrion Daniels Challenges Fan After", "Teddy Bear", "Former Nebraska Football Star Zatechka Explains Why The Huskers' Offense 'Sucks' In", "Some Nebraska Football Fans Growing Concerned Over Maurice Washington'S Perceived Attitude"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/17/os/b_1200x630/nebraska-fans-get-some-love-from-penn-state-writer-image-via-the-us-national-archivesflikr_2340805.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
