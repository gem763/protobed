A 2018 Porsche study concluded that the flying-car market will take off by 2025, offering passengers new means of \"terrestrial transport, at a lower cost and with greater flexibility.\"\n\nThis comes just months after Uber took to the skies, giving riders the option to skip the traffic jams by hailing a helicopter to the airport in New York. Aston Martin unveiled plans for a flying car concept called the Volante Vision in 2018, though the British brand says the car won't be ready for take-off until the middle of the next decade.\n\nAudi is also working on an air taxi concept.\n\nOther startups like Massachusetts-based Alaka'i Technologies and Next Future Transportation have plans to launch flying car concepts into the clouds as early as 2020.\n\nEarlier this year, Boeing successfully completed the first test of its prototype autonomous passenger air vehicle. It's unclear when this on-demand air transportation could become widely available.\n\nFollow Dalvin Brown on Twitter: @Dalvin_Brown\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Porsche, Boeing work on 'third dimension of travel' aka flying car", "description": "The collaboration will explore what a \u201cpremium\u201d flying car option might look like.", "authors": ["Dalvin Brown", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5mFfSzoF4NN5y7spSJG1CQ--~B/aD02MjQ7dz0xMDgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_money_325/58368efa0e045c01dfd9e85f8f6aae3a", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
