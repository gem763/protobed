His bodyguards stayed close to him.\n\nThe visit lasted around ten minutes and was appreciated by local residents, one of whom told euronews: \u201cIt shows solidarity. He\u2019s right to come. It\u2019s reassuring to us. We know we have support. It\u2019s heartwarming.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is that everything is made safe. But that will only last for a while, anyway. I think the police are going to have to do their job very well, and get to the root of this, in the urban outskirts. It\u2019s a cancer!\u201d\n\nThe latter comment, made not far from a mound of flowers in memory of the victims, referred to fears about extremism and anti-Semitism.\n\nIsraeli government spokesman Mark Regev told euronews: \u201cIt was very important for us to make this visit. First of all to show solidarity with the people of France, with the government of France, with the people of France, but also the French Jewish community which like all of France is also going through a difficult time.\u201d\n\nRegev added: \u201cThis is not a phenomenon of one or two countries. This is a global threat. And what is crucial is that we take what we saw yesterday, the march of solidarity between the leaders, and we transform that into concrete action, that governments act in a coordinated fashion, in a consistent way against these Islamic extremists who threaten everybody.\u201d\n\nFrench agency AFP reports that President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande did not initially extend an invitation to Netanyahu to come to Paris for Sunday\u2019s solidarity march, \u2013 nor to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas \u2013 on political, protocol and security grounds of complexity. First they acquiesced, then came anyway.", "description": "Benjamin Netanyahu visits site where Jewish men killed at kosher supermarket in eastern Paris", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/295268/1000x563_295268.jpg", "published_at": "2015-01-12"}
