The pride has been targeted once before, with two lionesses named River and Serabi fatally poisoned in 2017\n\nDistraught game ranger Bradden said his world has been 'turned upside down' by the 'muti killing' - muti being a South African term for traditional tribal medicine.\n\nHe added: 'I have worked with this pride of lions for 10 years in a world where they were not exploited for human greed or vanity but in a world that was part of responsible and ethical tourism.\n\n'These last few days have been the darkest I have ever experienced and finding my lions who were my life in the way that I found them will live and haunt me for the rest of my life.\n\n'I am convinced these lion parts do not go far but find their way into local muti markets with muti being body parts that are used to make traditional medicines or magic potions.\n\n'These markets need to be shut down and those who come into game reserves where these magnificent animals are safe and butcher them in such a way need to severely punished.\n\n'My heart is breaking for my four boys and girls and I am in a very dark place right now' he said.\n\nThe Council's Environment and Agriculture chief Mr Dana Wannenburg said that it appeared to be an 'inside job' with those who broke in knowing the layout and how to gain entry.\n\nHe said: 'We have heightened security with police patrolling the main roads in and around the reserve to boost existing security to maintain the safety of the animals such as rhinos'.\n\nThe Rietvlei Nature Reserve was also home to four of the famed African 'Big Five' having healthy populations of rhino, leopard and buffalo and up until this week a pride of lions.\n\nThe South African Police Service said an autopsy confirmed the lions were poisoned before they were butchered with a spokesman saying: 'This horrific crime will not go unpunished'.\n\nHead ranger Mr Stevens added: 'The Pride of Rietvlei was made up of rescue lions and who could not have been released into the wild as they would be unable to feed properly and survive.\n\n'We allowed no direct interaction between tourists and our lions and our job was to teach the tourists and children about the harm the 'lion petting' and 'walking with lions' industry does.\n\nJarvis and Tawani are pictured in the back of a flatbed truck before they were killed. Police believe the crime was an inside job because poachers had detailed knowledge of the reserve\n\nJarvis (left) and Tau (right) before they were poisoned. The Rietvlei pride were rescued from a canned hunting farm and as such could not be released back into the wild, because they lack the proper hunting instincts\n\n'It is so tragic that our magnificent pride met such a savage and cruel end at the hands of men looking for money' he said.\n\nRietvlei Nature Reserve is set in 3800 hectares right on the edge of Pretoria and is home to 2000 game including hippo, zebra, springbok, cheetah and has incredible bird viewing.\n\nIn April last year Gert Claasen, 48, had 3 lions butchered for body parts and 3 more killed and stolen to be butchered later from his reserve in Petrus Steyn in Free State Province.\n\nIn May last year at the Jugomara Predator Park in Limpopo Province distraught owner Justin Fernandes, 32, had three lions and a rare white tiger hacked to bits for their body parts.\n\nAnd in July last year Christa Sayman, 55, lost six lions to poachers who hacked off the heads and paw of four fully grown lions for black magic potions and killed two other lion cubss.\n\nA complete lion skeleton can be bought in South Africa for \u00a31000 but in Vietnam it is worth \u00a350,000 and the individual claws and teeth of a lion are highly prized and fetch top prices.\n\nA traditional healer from Limpopo who would not give her name said: 'The lion body parts are used to make strong muti which is a witchcraft potion made by healers to cast spells.\n\n'These can be used to protect a person from illness or cure them or make them strong or virile or even used to scare enemies away or prevent them from being attacked' she said.\n\nDr Kelly Marnewick of the Endangered Wildlife Trust keeps a close track on lions mutilated and poached or killed on private breeding farms and sanctuaries throughout South Africa.\n\nShe said:'It is mostly the claws, heads and teeth of the lions the poachers are after and in 2017 there were 22 captive lions killed and this is something that we are watching closely'.\n\nIt is feared lion bones are now becoming sought after to replace the far rarer tiger bones in demand in South East Asia which are being smuggled out for use in traditional medicines.", "description": "WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: Two male lions named Jarvis and Tau and two lionesses named Bashi and\u00a0Tawani were fed poisoned meat and then hacked apart at a nature reserve near Pretoria.", "authors": ["Jamie Pyatt In South Africa For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/09/20316744-0-image-a-19_1572339909275.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
