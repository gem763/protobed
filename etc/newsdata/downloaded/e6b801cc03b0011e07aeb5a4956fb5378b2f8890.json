It was actually a beautiful conversation,\" although he did not specify with whom.\n\nAsked if he mentioned former vice president and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden in the conversation, Trump said, \"Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement because it's disgraceful.\"\n\nTrump alleged that Biden \"talked [about] billions of dollars that he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor was taken off the case.\"\n\nTrump supporters have alleged that Biden, while in office, urged the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was allegedly looking into son Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe younger Biden joined the board of a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma, in 2014.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal meanwhile, reported Friday that Trump, during a July phone call, urged Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky \"about eight times\" to work with his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on an investigation of Hunter Biden.\n\nJoe Biden told reporters on the campaign trail that \"not one single credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertions. Not one single one. And so I have no comment except the president should start to be president.\"\n\nThe row over the intelligence community whistleblower mushroomed after the IC's top watchdog told House lawmakers on Thursday he would not reveal the details about it.\n\nThe Ukraine connection and other aspects of the story are so far unverified by officialdom.\n\nTrump addressed the story on Friday when he took questions from reporters in the Oval Office prior to a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.\n\nTrump said of the whistleblower's report, which is not public or in the hands of Congress: \"Everybody's read it; they laughed at it. It's another media disaster, and the media has lost so much credibility in this country.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on Friday that the reports of what she labeled \"a reliable\" whistleblower complaint \"raise grave, urgent concerns for our national security. We must be sure that the President and his Administration are conducting our national security and foreign policy in the best interest of the American people, not the President's personal interest.\"\n\nHer statement added that the administration's blocking of Acting DNI Joseph Maguire from providing Congress with the complaint \"violates the federal statute, which unequivocally states that the DNI 'shall' provide Congress this information. If the president has done what has been alleged, then he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his administration and our democracy.\"", "description": "The president blamed a \"partisan whistleblower,\" whose identity he said he didn't know, for an allegation that Trump had an improper conversation with a foreign leader.", "authors": ["Brian Naylor"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/20/ap_19263479425982_wide-41413add195dd7e6e53e4d626c305c483a05e2fd.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
