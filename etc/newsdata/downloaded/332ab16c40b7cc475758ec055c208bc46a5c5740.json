It\u2019s an epic Scorsese crime drama, but did you hear that all these 70-year-olds have young CGI faces? Robert De Niro, one of the stars of the film, certainly knows and Entertainment Tonight asked for his thoughts on the tech wizardry. He candidly told them, \u201cIt was okay. I just wanted it to work as best as it can,\u201d and \u201cthey did a very good job, I felt.\u201d The actor added, \u201cThey tried to make it the best to date that it could be.\u201d Asked about his state of mind around everyone finally getting to see the film soon, De Niro said, \u201cWe worked on it for a long time, so finally we were able to do it and complete it and get it out. So we\u2019re very happy that we were able to do it.\u201d The Irishman is a finished film, and it is coming out.
