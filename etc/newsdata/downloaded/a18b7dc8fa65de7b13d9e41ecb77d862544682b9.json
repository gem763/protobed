The majority of the rocket also touched down on one of SpaceX\u2019s concrete landing pads at the Cape after launch. Now, the Dragon cargo capsule is scheduled to meet up with the space station on Saturday, July 27th.\n\nOriginal story: This afternoon, SpaceX is slated to launch its latest cargo mission from Florida for NASA, sending about 5,000 pounds of supplies to the crew on the International Space Station. For this mission, the company is employing a Dragon cargo capsule that\u2019s already been to space twice before. If successful, it\u2019ll be the first time the same Dragon has gone on a third trip to space.\n\nPacked inside the Dragon\u2019s main storage compartment are some interesting goodies and science experiments for the crew to work with over the next few months. These include a printer designed to create 3D organ-like tissues in space, as well as an experiment to culture cells taken from patients with multiple sclerosis and Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nThe launch will also be carrying a key piece of hardware for the station itself. Tucked within the Dragon\u2019s trunk \u2014 the unpressurized cylindrical structure that rides on the back of the capsule during flight \u2014 is a new dock for the ISS. Known as the International Docking Adaptor, this will eventually be attached to a port on the exterior of the ISS. The installation will create a new parking spot for two future commercial spacecraft, both currently in development by SpaceX and Boeing.\n\nThis docking adapter is actually the third of its kind\n\nThis docking adapter, made by Boeing, is actually the third of its kind. The first International Docking Adaptor was destroyed in 2015, when the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying it to the station disintegrated after takeoff. A second docking adaptor was launched in 2016 on another Falcon 9 and then installed to a port during a spacewalk. That adaptor saw some action for the first time this March when SpaceX\u2019s new Crew Dragon capsule automatically docked with the port during an uncrewed test flight. Once this new dock is installed, SpaceX and Boeing will have two parking options at the ISS, providing more flexibility for future missions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really looking forward to getting this on there,\u201d Bill Spetch, NASA\u2019s deputy manager of the International Space Station Transportation Office, said during a press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s an important piece of hardware for the future of ISS, as it sets the stage for how we are going to operate with Commercial Crew vehicles and our partners in the future.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s flight is one of the final cargo missions SpaceX will do under its first resupply contract with NASA. Through this agreement, SpaceX is tasked with launching 20 cargo missions to the space station, and this upcoming flight is the company\u2019s 18th resupply launch. Both the 19th and 20th resupply missions will also fly Dragons on their third trips to space, according to SpaceX.\n\nSpaceX\u2019s vision of reusing hardware is on full display for this mission\n\nSpaceX will continue launching supplies to the ISS once the 20th mission is complete. NASA awarded SpaceX a second contract, tasking the company with launching even more supply missions through 2024. For those flights, SpaceX plans to switch over to a new version of the Dragon cargo capsule, one that\u2019s very similar to SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon that will soon carry NASA astronauts to the station. Just like the Crew Dragon, the cargo version will be able to automatically dock with the ISS. SpaceX\u2019s current cargo capsules have to be grabbed by the station\u2019s robotic arm and then placed onto the ISS. Soon, all Dragons will be able to get to the station on their own.\n\nThat future is still a few years off. In the meantime, SpaceX\u2019s vision of reusing hardware is on full display for this mission. Not only has the Dragon cargo capsule already flown twice (once in 2015 and once in 2017), but most of the Falcon 9 rocket on this flight also flew to space and back for another cargo mission in May. For this launch, the rocket will attempt to touch down on one of SpaceX\u2019s concrete landing pads at Cape Canaveral, Florida after takeoff. SpaceX boasts a nearly perfect record for ground landings \u2014 except for one rocket ditched into the ocean on accident.\n\nToday\u2019s flight is slated for liftoff at 6:01PM ET from SpaceX\u2019s launchpad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The company has an instantaneous launch window, so the rocket has to take off on time or the mission must be delayed. It\u2019s looking likely that this flight may not happen today \u2014 or even this week. There\u2019s only a 30 percent chance that weather will cooperate this afternoon, the same odds as yesterday when SpaceX tried to launch this mission the first time. If SpaceX has to postpone today, the earliest this flight can get off the ground is in August, because of other spacecraft scheduled to arrive and depart the ISS in the coming weeks.\n\nFor now, the launch is on, and both NASA and SpaceX plan to provide live coverage. NASA\u2019s live stream will begin at 5:45PM ET on the agency\u2019s dedicated TV channel, and SpaceX\u2019s live stream will begin around the same time.", "description": "This afternoon, SpaceX is slated to launch its latest cargo mission from Florida for NASA, sending about 5,000 pounds of supplies to the crew on the International Space Station.
