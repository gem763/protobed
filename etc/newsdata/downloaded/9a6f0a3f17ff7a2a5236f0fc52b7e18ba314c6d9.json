(AP) - An uninspired win over South Alabama and a devastating overtime loss at Colorado have made Saturday night\u2019s game against Northern Illinois a big one for Nebraska.\n\nThe Cornhuskers (1-1) have yet to put together a complete game, and they\u2019re facing a Mid-American Conference opponent that has a knack for knocking off Power Five conference teams.\n\nNebraska was one of the Huskies\u2019 victims two years ago. Northern Illinois (1-1) beat the Huskers 21-17 to become the first team from a Group of Five conference to win in Lincoln in 15 years.\n\n\u201cThey put our face in the mud,\u201d cornerback DiCaprio Bootle said, \u201cand we weren\u2019t happy. That\u2019s something to be mindful of.\u201d\n\nThe loss was the tipping point for the firing of athletic director Shawn Eichorst five days later. It also spelled the beginning of the end for coach Mike Riley, who was fired after a 4-8 season, and led to the hiring of Scott Frost.\n\n\u201cWhen I look back on that loss, I think about how we didn\u2019t give them the respect that they deserved,\u201d linebacker Mohamed Barry said. \u201cI feel like practice was very loose that week and that people were like \u2018Oh it\u2019s the Sun Belt Conference or whatever, we\u2019re going to beat them, we\u2019re going to dust them, we can play relaxed football, we should beat them by 40.\u2019\n\n\u201cEvery team we\u2019re facing this year,\u201d Barry added, \u201cwe\u2019re going to give them the respect that they deserve like they\u2019re the best team. That\u2019s how we\u2019re preparing for NIU.\u201d\n\nNorthern Illinois first-year coach Thomas Hammock, who took over after Rod Carey left for Temple, said the Huskies held up well in front of 46,000 rowdy fans in a 35-17 loss at No. 11 Utah last week.\n\nHammock visited 90,000-seat Memorial Stadium when he was running backs coach at Wisconsin in 2012. He said the 18 NIU players who appeared in the 2017 game can fall back on their experience in Lincoln. The players who weren\u2019t there two years ago will be filled in about what awaits.\n\n\u201cI can certainly explain to our team what type of environment they\u2019re walking into,\u201d Hammock said. \u201cI know Nebraska will be a lot louder at night. But I think we have confidence to go in there and play our best game.\u201d\n\nWHATEVER YOU SAY, COACH\n\nNebraska quarterback Adrian Martinez said he had no problem with Frost\u2019s play-calling in overtime against Colorado. Frost went conservative, calling two straight run plays before Martinez took a sack, and the Huskers missed the tying field goal. After the game, Frost said he didn\u2019t want to risk an interception.\n\n\u201cWhatever he is calling, I know there is a thought process behind it and one that I side with,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI trust him as a play-caller and what he is calling and it is my job to execute it.\u201d\n\nLET\u2019S SPREAD IT AROUND\n\nOnly five Nebraska players have more than one reception through two games. Of nine wide receivers on the depth chart, only three have a catch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my job to spread the ball around, and I go through my reads or progressions and I throw to the open guy,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it is something that is intentional on my part, but it needs to be made a point to get some other guys involved, too.\u201d\n\nTOUGH SLEDDING\n\nNebraska is averaging 138 yards rushing per game and 3.1 per carry. Last season those averages were 209 and 5.4. Dedrick Mills, the primary between-the-tackles runner, is at just under 3 yards per carry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing as good as I can do,\u201d Mills said. \u201cBasically, I\u2019m not seeing holes I know that are there, or I\u2019m not seeing them early enough.\u201d\n\nHUSKIE-HUSKER TIES\n\nNIU quarterback Ross Bowers used to throw passes to Nebraska receiver Kanawai Noa. Both are graduate transfers from California. Bowers was the Pac-12\u2019s fourth-leading passer as Cal\u2019s starter in 2017. Noa was the Pac-12\u2019s sixth-leading receiver with 56 catches for 788 yards. Nebraska defensive line coach Tony Tuioti knows Bowers. He was a Cal assistant in 2017-18. Also, NIU linebacker Antonio Jones-Davis and Nebraska linebacker Alex Davis are first cousins.\n\nANOTHER POWER FIVE FOE\n\nNorthern Illinois is in a stretch of three straight road games against Power Five opponents. After an open date next week, the Huskies play at Vanderbilt. NIU has eight wins over Power Five teams since 2009.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An uninspired win over South Alabama and a devastating overtime loss at Colorado have made Saturday night's game against Northern Illinois a big one for Nebraska.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Eric Olson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/nebraska_colorado_football_48556_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
