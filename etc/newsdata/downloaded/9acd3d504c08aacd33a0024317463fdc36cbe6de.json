The document, first reported by POLITICO Tuesday night, alleges that King misused city resources to benefit himself and his wife, Neva Shillingford-King, who works for influential healthcare workers union 1199SEIU. In one instance, city resources were allegedly used to support a retreat and a family wedding in the Virgin Islands. The report also accused King of mounting a campaign of retaliation and intimidation against staffers he believed were cooperating with Council investigators.\n\nJohnson declined to elaborate on the nature of the referrals, which could have been made to any number of ethics or law enforcement organizations.\n\n\u201cThese agencies don\u2019t want people to know who is looking into what as they potentially conduct an investigation,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe report noted that King did not cooperate with the probe.\n\nIn an email to POLITICO Wednesday evening, the lawmaker disputed the findings of his colleagues.\n\n\u201cYesterday, the [Standards and Ethics Committee] submitted their version of events to substantiate their agenda to the execution of me,\u201d an email from King\u2019s official Council address read. \u201cI am currently out of NYC and paying respect to my father whom we buried two years ago today.\u201d\n\nHowever, King said that once he returns to the city over the weekend, he will speak about the investigation at a Bronx church. That will not give him much time to change the minds of his colleagues, who are set to vote on his punishment Monday.\n\nThe Council committee has recommended King be suspended for 30 days, be fined $15,000, have his office overseen by a monitor for the remainder of his term and be stripped of all his committee posts.\n\nJohnson said Wednesday that he thought King should resign. However, the speaker also said that he would not make any formal recommendations to have King expelled \u2014 something that is within the Council\u2019s power to do. Instead, Johnson said that he would let the committee\u2019s findings make their way to the floor for a special stated meeting next week at which the members will vote.\n\n\u201cI have always said that I will respect the work of that committee,\" Johnson said. \"And in the immediate aftermath of the committee making the recommendation, I\u2019m not going to undermine them.\u201d\n\nHowever, that decision did not appear to be unanimous among the members. On Wednesday, Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer called for King to be expelled. And it appeared as if there might be others in the Council who agreed with the Queens lawmaker.\n\n\u201cThere likely will be debate over the coming week before Monday over what individual members think is appropriate,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cDo they think this is appropriate? Do they think it should go father? And we will have those conversations.\u201d\n\nHowever, the question of expulsion could prove to be a tricky one.\n\nOne member who spoke with POLITICO on background said that booting King from the body would be tantamount to overruling the will of the voters. King has won multiple elections for his seat \u2014 an argument that proved crucial when the Council seemed poised to expel Council Member Eugene Mastropieri in 1979 for conflicts of interest and lying to investigators.\n\nAs that vote neared, good government group Citizens Union successfully made the case that the charges did not warrant overruling the democratic process. At the time, some members argued that expulsion was a question for outside law enforcement to decide \u2014 something that is a possibility in King's case now that information has been shared with other authorities.", "description": "A 48-page report drafted by the Council\u2019s Committee on Standards and Ethics paints a damning portrait of King's conduct over the last several years.", "authors": ["Joe Anuta", "Sally Goldenberg"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/13/53/63a591404958b607ed80557adbc4/king-art2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
