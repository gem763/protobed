Add Interest\n\nHey guys! I can\u2019t believe that next week is the finale of \"Bachelor In Paradise\"! This summer has absolutely flown by and I just realized that we won\u2019t get our next Bachelor fix until January!\n\nParadise comes to an end\n\n\"Paradise as you all know it is officially over.\"- Chris Harrison\n\nNo more new friends will walk down the stairs of Paradise as the beach has officially closed. This week, we saw many last-minute attempts at love. Some flourished with bold moves and romantic gestures and some ... well ... didn\u2019t make it out.\n\nLet\u2019s go over the major highlights of this week's episodes!\n\nDean's ultimatum\n\n\"I know the decision I want to make but I\u2019m scared.\"- Caelynn\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I was more shocked that Dean came back to Paradise with a total baby-face, or that he gave Caelynn an ultimatum: play it safe and continue to date Connor, or take a chance at a wild, crazy romance and leave Paradise with him ... right now.\n\nCaelynn is confused, scared and frustrated because she closed off her heart to Dean and has been developing a strong relationship with Connor. So strong in fact, that they were headed to the boom-boom room to make their relationship official. Connor becomes protective over Caelynn and is angry that Dean came back after what he put Caelynn through.\n\n\"If it\u2019s closed then close it, why re-open it?\"- Connor\n\nUltimately, Caelynn follows her heart and leaves Paradise with Dean. A decision that I am sooo for!! I thought that Dean\u2019s grand gesture was incredibly romantic and I am so happy to see this couple thriving.\n\n\"I know we\u2019ve had our differences but if something goes south, call me \"- Kristina\n\nAs for Dean and Caelynn, the \"vantasy\" suite has officially kicked off.\n\nKristina breaks up with Blake\n\n\"I can\u2019t get there if I\u2019m being real.\"- Kristina\n\nThe relationship we never could understand has finally ended. Blake poured out his heart to Kristina, who shared that she doesn't reciprocate his feelings. She decides her time in Paradise has ended and says her goodbyes, leaving Blake alone and brokenhearted.\n\n\"I\u2019ve made mistakes but I'm not a bad person.\"- Blake\n\nAlthough Blake put in some great effort over the last few episodes, there seemed to be too much baggage for Kristina to trust Blake ... and frankly, I don\u2019t blame her. Perhaps since the show, they\u2019ve had time to rekindle their romance off-camera? We can only hope and see for next week\u2019s finale!\n\nDemi struggles with coming out\n\n\"I\u2019m still holding back because I\u2019m scared.\"- Demi\n\nWill Demi be able to get past her fears of the judgment of what people will say and think about her and Kristian? Or will those fears prevent this relationship from going to the next level?\n\nThis week, we saw Demi really struggling about being affectionate in public with Kristian. Their relationship before Paradise was very private and behind closed doors, which allowed a safety net for Demi to explore her sexuality. But now that they are an official item, the pressure and fear of judgment are really getting to her and causing her to doubt if Kristian will be patient enough and wait for her.\n\n\"I see you getting more touch from someone else, innocently, playfully and I feel like I\u2019m not enough.\"- Demi\n\nKristian assures Demi that she is good enough and her absolute priority and she will be as patient as she needs to be. This made me really appreciate Kristian for how compassionate and understanding she is. I am really surprised by her and I have to say that she has been one of my favorites this season.\n\nRed flags fly for Katie and Chris\n\nA couple that has so much potential but yet, something is missing, Katie and Chris show us glimpses of what a strong couple looks like in Paradise ... but also what a not-so-strong couple looks like. Chris is having a tough time opening up, which scares Katie, understandably. It\u2019s the final days of Paradise and she has spent her entire time developing a connection with Chris, only to now see that he is uncertain of his emotional availability to put into a blossoming romance and potential engagement. The inconsistency causes me to think there is uncertainty in Chris\u2019s mind about what\u2019s coming at the end of Paradise.\n\nChris doesn\u2019t want to hurt Katie, but he also doesn\u2019t know how to express his true feelings. Katie continues to try to get it out of him but she continues to hit a roadblock. With fantasy suites coming up, I\u2019m hoping the extra \"alone\" time they have will give them the clarity they need on whether this a relationship that can succeed or even exist after Paradise.\n\nJPJ takes Tayshia to prom\n\n\"I didn\u2019t expect it but love is definitely knocking at my door.\" -JPJ\n\nWho would\u2019ve known this couple would actually be a thing? John Paul Jones gave us all the rom-com vibes this week with his love for Tayshia. Let\u2019s not forget the first prom in Paradise that ended up making me wish I were there for a slow dance with my hubby.\n\nI have to say that even though JPJ made a huge ruckus at our wedding, I still have a soft spot for how much he loves Tayshia and as a woman, I appreciate all the effort he puts into developing their relationship.\n\nWhile JPJ is all in, Tayshia shocks us all and breaks up with him, leaving us all brokenhearted.\n\nNicole, he's just not that into you\n\n\"I think I\u2019m falling in love with you, but I\u2019m not in love with you.\"- Clay\n\nIt\u2019s always tough to say those three words everyone wants to hear in a relationship, and all Nicole wants to hear from Clay right now is \"I love you.\" But Clay has played the slow pace game throughout Paradise and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see him speed up now. It\u2019s been clear that Clay likes Nicole but love seems to not exist just yet.\n\nNicole still takes a risk and heads to the fantasy suite where I\u2019m sure she will get the final answer on where Clay stands with his feelings towards her.\n\nBri makes Bachelor history\n\nYou know that feeling when you ask someone out that you really like and they shut you down? Well, imagine that happening on a national TV show! At the final rose ceremony of Paradise, Luke S. asked Bri if she would accept his rose so that they could continue to get to know one another. She replies, \"I came here to find love and don\u2019t see that with you.\" Jaw drop. Chris Harrison explains that no one in Bachelor history has ever turned down a rose and asks if any girl wants to accept Luke's rose, but no one does. Just. Wow.\n\nFantasy suites are here\n\nThis week in Paradise was full of ultimatums and final stabs at love, but ultimately only a few couples will make it to the fantasy suites next week: Nicole and Clay; Hannah and Dylan; Chris and Katie; and Demi and Kristian .\n\nWill Demi\u2019s fear of coming out inhibit her relationship with Kristian?\n\nIs Clay ready to commit to Nicole?\n\nAnd are the red flags we\u2019ve seen with Chris and Katie still flying high?\n\nWe can only wait and see for the \"Bachelor in Paradise\" finale next Tuesday!", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
