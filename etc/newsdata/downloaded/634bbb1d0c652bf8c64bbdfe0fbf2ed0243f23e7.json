Another time he received life-saving measures when someone called medical personnel after he was found unresponsive in the tunnels of the Las Vegas Wash.\n\nThe addiction led him to the tunnels in the first place. There, no one would judge him. Anything that would fit inside a needle, he would use - cocaine, crystal meth, heroin.\n\nAddiction would keep him in those tunnels for seven years.\n\n\u201cThere was a point where nothing mattered anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t care whether I lived or died.\u201d\n\nBut he got another chance at life after getting arrested. He was walking out of the wash with some cocaine and heroin he had just picked up and was about to do another shot when a police officer stopped him.\n\n\u201cHe decided to take me to jail, and that was the start of the first change of my life,\u201d Ramos said.\n\nAfter being jailed, Ramos became a candidate for the drug court program offered at Las Vegas Justice Court. Officials say the goal is to get more repeat offenders off the street and on a path toward rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cYou have defendants, when you look at their scope and rap sheet for things like petty larceny and burglary, when you ask them if they were under the influence while doing these acts, that\u2019s when you start to find out they\u2019ve been using all along,\u201d said Wanda Negron, the specialty court coordinator. \u201cThe average person doesn\u2019t go stealing a car . addiction is a driving force. These things don\u2019t always come up in the police report.\u201d\n\nNevada has taken in thousands of participants since it started using drug courts in 1992. To get into the program, a defendant will plead guilty or no contest to drug-related charges. A judge will then decline to convict the defendant or suspend the case by putting the person on probation.\n\nFunding is limited to 60 participants to annually enter the Las Vegas Justice Court program, yet on average, there are 14 addicts referred each month, officials said.\n\nLas Vegas Justice Court is in the second year of a five-year plan to grow the program, using nearly $400,000 in annual grants from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to get more repeat offenders into treatment.\n\nThis gives participants a chance to treat their addictions through sober living and outpatient drug treatment, as well as medication-assisted treatment. Those arrested on certain felony charges can have those charges reduced to misdemeanors upon completion of the minimum 18-month program, Negron said.\n\nMore than half of new drug court referrals involve opioid dependence and at least five referrals a month are homeless, according to the court. The new grant funding will go toward enhanced counseling, random drug testing, co-occurring treatment, bus passes and workforce training.\n\nNegron said once an individual is referred to the program, the criteria they have to meet from there is \u201cpretty intense\u201d and program noncompliance is not tolerated. Participants undergo formal mental health evaluations and regular drug screenings.\n\nIn her role as a program coordinator, Negron said she would typically look at the unique needs of a participant and try to cater the program to meet those needs, which may include connecting participants with a job, medical insurance, or arranging for government-issued identification.\n\nThe program has a 79% compliance-retention rate, officials said.\n\n\u201cThe more they see themselves progressing the more apt they are to stay,\u201d Negron said. \u201cThat reduces recidivism rates.\u201d\n\nRamos, who graduated from the program earlier this month, said October marked his 18th month in sobriety. He works full-time as a cook on the Strip and hopes to go back to school. It\u2019s worlds away from when he was living in the tunnels, but the journey getting there wasn\u2019t easy.\n\nHe said he agreed to go into the program to avoid jail time, but shortly after getting accepted, he was on the run for almost a month. He was offered a choice; go back to drug court or spend six months in jail. He chose drug court.\n\n\u201cI almost died because they had me on something called the Vivitrol shot . it\u2019s supposed to prevent you from getting high off heroin, and I decided to test the theory thoroughly,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they found me, I was in worse shape than when they found me in the wash.\u201d\n\nJustice of the Peace Cynthia Cruz said Ramos\u2018 case wasn\u2019t uncommon, and that relapses were inevitable.\n\n\u201cA lot of people who have relapsed are still in the program,\u201d she said.\n\nStill, there are limits when it comes to second chances. \u201cMy joke is, \u2018you can\u2019t just be relapsing six times,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nCruz\u2019s courtroom isn\u2019t structured like most. The atmosphere is informal, as Cruz passes out candy and sobriety coins to defendants for advancing in the program. Her rapport with them is amicable, addressing them by first name as she asks them with earnest, how they\u2019re holding up.\n\n\u201cI like to be down on the floor with them,\u201d she said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t afraid to talk to me, and that enables them to find help instead of me being the judge that threatens to throw them in jail.\u201d\n\nDuring Ramos\u2018 graduation, Cruz gave him a final sobriety coin, a certificate and a copy of his booking photo to remind him how far he\u2019s come. Today, he\u2019s unrecognizable from the man in that photo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like this (program) cures addiction,\u201d he said. \u201cI still think about using all the time, but the difference now is that I have the tools to not act on those impulses.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Las Vegas Sun, http://www.lasvegassun.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jeremy Ramos almost died three times because of his drug addiction.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kelcie Grega"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
