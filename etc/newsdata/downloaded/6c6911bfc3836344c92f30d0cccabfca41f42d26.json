Energized by a recent trip to Africa, Lorre\u2019s thinking evolved to the point where he decided that Gardell\u2019s love interest in his new CBS sitcom, \u201cBob Hearts Abishola\u201d \u2014 premiering Monday at 8:30 p.m. \u2014 should be a first-generation immigrant woman.\n\n\u201cThey are the most ambitious, hardworking, focused, disciplined human beings you can imagine,\u201d says Lorre, 66. \u201cSo we decided to do that.\u201d\n\nStill, they faced a huge problem. They couldn\u2019t get a handle on the woman. \u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d Lorre says. \u201cHow can we possibly write this?\u201d\n\nBefore you can say \u201cGoogle,\u201d Higgins, 41, went to his computer and typed three words in the search box: \u201cfemale Nigerian comic.\u201d\n\nEnter Gina Yashere. The London-born comic had just performed at the Montreal Just For Laughs festival and was looking forward to some R&R in New York. The phone rang. Her agent told her something hundreds of comics dream of hearing: \u201cYou\u2019re getting on a plane to LA tomorrow. You\u2019re meeting Chuck Lorre.\u201d\n\nYashere\u2019s internet videos convinced Lorre and Higgins that she\u2019d be a perfect consultant on their new show, the plot of which was taking shape as the story of a man who falls in love with a Nigerian nurse. Yashere asked Lorre if he wanted her to play the nurse. After he said, \u201cNot necessarily,\u201d Yashere asked herself an important question: \u201cWhat the hell am I here for?\u201d\n\nShe was there to tell her story. Yashere\u2019s parents emigrated from Nigeria to England and started from the bottom, despite their professional qualifications (her father had a Ph.D. and qualified to work as a lawyer back home). \u201cMy mom wanted us to have to avail ourselves of all the opportunities in England,\u201d says Yashere, who was later cast as Abishola\u2019s friend. \u201cSo she hustled to give us these opportunities. These stories started to go in [the show] and Chuck and Al said, \u2018Let\u2019s write this thing.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s how Abishola was born. But who would play her? Again, Lorre, who has cast many hit sitcoms, was out of his comfort zone. \u201cFinding someone to play opposite Billy was . . . prayer, really,\u201d he says. Then Lorre gave a screen test to Nigerian actress Folake Olowofoyeku and says, \u201cShe just crushed it. Every moment in front of the camera is an honest moment. Funny and true and strong.\u201d\n\n\u201cBob Hearts Abishola\u201d won\u2019t operate like standard sitcom \u2014 Bob only meets Abishola because he has a heart attack and she is his nurse. \u201cWaking up after a stent procedure is not your normal meet-cute,\u201d Lorre says. \u201cThe wonderful thing about Abishola is she\u2019s not looking. She\u2019s here to make a living and get her son to a place of success.\u201d\n\nAs much as \u201cBob Hearts Abishola\u201d honors immigrants, Lorre also pays tribute to the small businessman in the character of Bob, who\u2019s a compression-sock salesman. Are the writers in the writers\u2019 room wearing them?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting there,\u201d Lorre says, with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve always been fascinated by the things we take for granted and see all the time and recognizing that, somewhere, someone made that. That\u2019s what small businesses are all about. We\u2019re not just a small business, we\u2019re the best at what we do. That was part of Bob\u2019s makeup.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if his new show \u2014 and the casting of African American actors in lead roles in many new CBS series \u2014 coincided with the exit of former CBS CEO Les Moonves, Lorre says, \u201cIt had nothing to do with it.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t chasing this. As in, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s time for something diverse.\u2019 What a dumb way to proceed,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s not writing a story. That\u2019s chasing a political agenda. The character that Folake plays is to me a very admirable character. She\u2019s the heart and soul of what it is to be an American.\u201d", "description": "Chuck Lorre tapped Gina Yashere to help consult on new CBS sitcom, \u201cBob Hearts Abishola,\u201d starring Billy Gardell and Folake Olowofoyeku.", "authors": ["Robert Rorke", "September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/bob-hearts-abishola.jpeg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
