The mystery remains unsolved.", "language": "en", "text": "caption Piles of human bones are scattered around the edges of Roopkund Lake. source Ashokyadav739/Wikimedia Commons\n\nA remote lake nicknamed \u201cSkeleton Lake\u201d sits mo re than 16,500 feet up in the Indian Himalayas.\n\nThe lake, which is actually called Roopkund, is the final resting place of up to 800 human skeletons and frozen bodies.\n\nOne researcher who traveled there said visitors \u201ccan\u2019t take a single step without stepping on bones.\u201d\n\nDNA analysis has shown that some of the remains were from groups of people who died about 1,000 years apart.\n\nScientists still don\u2019t know what killed the people buried at the lake or how they ended up there.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nNestled high in the Indian Himalayas, a tiny body of water has earned a macabre nickname: \u201cSkeleton Lake.\u201d\n\nOfficially named Roopkund, the lake\u2019s edges are rimmed with human bones and frozen bodies \u2013 some with frozen hair and flesh still attached. Bold hikers have stacked some of the remains into morbid shrines.\n\nOn a rare summer day, when parts of the lake melt, more scattered skeletal remains sometimes float to the surface. Researchers have determined that up to 800 people are buried there.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a small, enclosed space, and there are bones everywhere,\u201d William Sax, an anthropologist who visited Roopkund in 1978 and consulted on a 2004 National Geographic documentary about the lake, told Business Insider. \u201cIt feels scary and disturbing.\u201d\n\nAnthropologists like Sax are interested in the area because nobody knows what killed the people buried there. A forest ranger named Hari Kishan Madhwal came upon the lake in 1942, yet more than 75 years later, researchers are no closer to pinpointing how or why these people perished. The mystery of the lake deepened this summer, when a DNA study of 38 skeletons revealed that people from three genetically distinct groups had died at Roopkund in at least two waves, about 1,000 years apart.\n\nRead More: Hundreds of skeletons were found in a mysterious Himalayan lake. A new analysis shows that some of them died 1,000 years apart.\n\n\u201cWe expected that this analysis would help resolve the mystery of Roopkund Lake by determining the ancestry of these skeletons,\u201d Eadaoin Harney, the lead author of that recent study, told Business Insider. \u201cWhile we did accomplish this goal, I think we have instead revealed that this site is even more mysterious than we ever expected.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what it\u2019s like to visit Roopkund, and a few scientists\u2019 best guesses about what might have happened there.\n\nFor the recent analysis, Harney and her team drilled into the femurs and long arm bones of dozens of skeletons from the lake to extract DNA.\n\nsource Wikimedia Commons\n\nThey found that of the 38 skeletons examined, 23 had ancestry related to people from present-day India and died between the seventh and 10th centuries, during several events.\n\nFourteen of the skeletons, meanwhile, were most closely related to people from the Mediterranean islands of Crete and Greece, and one had Southeast Asian ancestry. That group of 15 individuals died between the 17th and 20th centuries, likely in a single event.\n\nThat discovery changed scientists\u2019 understanding of Skeleton Lake, since previous research had suggested that most of the bones at the site dated back to the year 800 or so.\n\ncaption The fringes of Roopkund Lake are wreathed in human skeletons. source Wikimedia Commons\n\nSax said the new data about a second wave of deaths was \u201ca real stunner.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe timing of that most recent event \u2013 which happened sometime in the last few hundred years \u2013 makes it a really interesting puzzle,\u201d he added.\n\nConducting this kind of research at the lake isn\u2019t easy. Roopkund, which means \u201clake of form\u201d in Hindi, is more than 16,500 feet above sea-level.\n\ncaption Nanda Devi National Park. source Spattadar/Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe surrounding environs are breathtakingly beautiful, Sax said. The lake is located in India\u2019s Nanda Devi National Park.\n\ncaption A photograph of Nanda Devi National Park. source Abhijeet Rane/Flickr\n\nStill, he added, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason for anybody to be up there.\u201d That\u2019s what makes the presence of these skeletons so mysterious.\n\ncaption Often, Roopkund is buried under a layer of snow. But when that ice cover melts, even more skeletons are visible around the lake\u2019s edge. source Anirban Biswas/Flickr\n\nFor visitors to the lake, Sax said, the site\u2019s macabre history is plainly visible: \u201cYou can\u2019t take a single step without steeping on bones.\u201d\n\ncaption Bones from scattered human skeletons scattered around Roopkund Lake. source Himadri Sinha Roy\n\nSome travelers have collected the bones and stacked them in piles, out of fascination or perhaps respect. But such human interference disturbs the site, Harney said.\n\ncaption The rocks surrounding Roopkund are replete with human remains. source Himadri Sinha Roy\n\nIt makes it \u201cquite difficult to perform standard archaeological analyses on these remains,\u201d she added.\n\nSome tourists reportedly even take bones away from the site as morbid souvenirs.\n\nMyriad explanations have been put forward as to how these individuals perished, from a freak hailstorm to a mass ritual suicide.\n\ncaption Roopkund Lake is located more than 16,000 feet up in the Indian Himalayas. source Wikimedia Commons\n\nHarney\u2019s team thinks it\u2019s possible that some people who perished during the first wave of Skeleton Lake deaths experienced \u201ca mass death during a pilgrimage event.\u201d\n\ncaption A hiker holds up a human skull that he picked up on the Roopkund banks. source Himadri Sinha Roy\n\nThe lake is near a present-day pilgrimage route through the region, the study authors wrote.\n\ncaption Roopkund Lake with two people on its bank. source Pramod Joglekar\n\nA local folk song even describes a mass pilgrimage to the shrine of a mountain goddess, called Nanda Devi, near the lake.\n\ncaption A stony shrine near Roopkund Lake, with tourists and hikers in the background. source Atish Waghwase\n\nThe study authors said the song is about \u201ca king and queen and their many attendants, who \u2013 due to their inappropriate, celebratory behavior \u2013 were struck down by the wrath of Nanda Devi.\u201d The lyrics recount the goddess flinging balls as \u201chard as iron.\u201d\n\nThose balls of iron could have been hail that rained down during a severe storm, according to the study authors.\n\ncaption A human skull and multiple femur bones are stacked haphazardly on rocks near Roopkund Lake, which is visible in the distance. source Ashokyadav739/Wikimedia Commons\n\nHarney said researchers observed compression fractures on several of the skeletons that might be consistent with injuries from a hailstorm or rockslide.\n\ncaption Trekkers leave their packs near piles of bones and frozen bodies on the edge of Roopkund Lake. source Atish Waghwase\n\nSax also recalled that some of the skulls found near the lake appeared to have been cracked open, damaged by blunt objects.\n\nUltimately, though, Harney is hesitant to speculate about any causes of death, since it\u2019s not possible to determine that information through the genetic analysis her team completed.\n\ncaption Roopkund Lake is 18,000 feet up in the Indian Himalaya, and the trek to get there takes days. source Atish Waghwase\n\nSince the skeletons date back to multiple different time periods, it\u2019s likely that they died in different ways, she said.\n\nIn their analysis, Harney\u2019s team wrote that the findings \u201crefute previous suggestions that the skeletons of Roopkund Lake were deposited in a single catastrophic event.\u201d\n\nHarney and her colleagues\u2019 analysis did, however, put to rest a few theories about what could have killed the people at the lake.\n\ncaption Roopkund Lake is surrounded by rock-strewn glaciers and snow-clad mountains in India\u2019s Chamoli District. source Shubhamrathod15/Wikimedia Commons\n\nThese groups probably didn\u2019t die in an epidemic, as a 2004 National Geographic documentary suggested, because the DNA analysis found no evidence of bacterial infection in any of the skeletons.\n\nBattle probably wasn\u2019t the cause either, since the skeletons Harney\u2019s team examined came from 23 males and 15 females, including children and elderly people, and no weapons were found nearby.\n\nKathleen Morrison, an anthropologist at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the recent study, offered one other possible explanation: \u201cWhen you see a lot of human skeletons, usually it\u2019s a graveyard,\u201d she told The Atlantic.\n\ncaption Roopkund is a high-altitude glacial lake in the Uttarakhand state of India. source Abhijeet Rane/Flickr\n\n\u201cI suspect that they\u2019re aggregated there, that local people put them in the lake,\u201d she said, noting that it\u2019s unlikely all these people died at the lake\u2019s edge.\n\nBut Harney thinks the site is too remote to be a graveyard. \u201cI don\u2019t know of any evidence that would support this,\u201d she said.\n\ncaption The Roopkund \u201cSkeleton\u201d Lake and surrounding mountains. source Atish Waghwase\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Harney\u2019s team analyzed DNA from present-day groups that live in the areas closest to Roopkund, and did not find many genetic similarities between these individuals and the skeletons. That indicates it\u2019s unlikely that a local population once used this site as a burial ground.\n\nHarney said further study of the bones and bodies is needed to figure out how these individuals died.\n\ncaption Snow-covered human bones found at Roopkund Lake. source Pramod Joglekar\n\n\u201cI think that there are really two parts to this mystery,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first is, who are these people and why did they go to Roopkund Lake?\u201d\n\nTo answer that question, Harney thinks researchers would need to find historical written accounts that describe a journey to Roopkund.\n\n\u201cThe second question that I would like to answer is, how did these individuals die?\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a large number of remains still at Roopkund Lake that are yet to be analyzed in any way, so it is possible that in the future we will be better able to answer this question.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - In India, 800 or so bodies \u2014 some from individuals who perished a millennia ago \u2014 were found in a small lake.
