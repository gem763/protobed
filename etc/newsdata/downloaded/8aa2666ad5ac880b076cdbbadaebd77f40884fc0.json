Quarterback Mitchell Trubisky hit Taylor Gabriel for a 22-yard pass, and then scrambled for another first down. But rather than try to get closer, Coach Matt Nagy called for Trubisky to take a knee, and Pineiro came on, with his kick missing wide to the left.\n\nAD\n\nThe Bears lose to the Chargers on a last-second missed FG \ud83d\ude2f pic.twitter.com/cvxQisdEfz \u2014 ESPN (@espn) October 27, 2019\n\nAfter the infamous double doink by Cody Parkey in the playoffs in January, the Bears conducted a lengthy kicker search before landing on Pineiro, who had missed only one kick (during Week 3) this season. But he missed one off the upright in the first quarter \u2014 a single doink \u2014 and made three before failing with the game on the line.\n\nAD\n\nAfterward, Nagy said he had given \u201czero thought\u201d to trying to help Pineiro by getting closer, a decision that was widely second-guessed.\n\nMatt Nagy, why in the HECK would you take a knee when you\u2019re still 41 yards away!! Run the ball and get closer. Those few yards made the difference!\n\n\n\nAlso, #Bears need another kicker... again. \u2014 Emmanuel Acho (@thEMANacho) October 27, 2019\n\nEven the team was at a loss to explain this loss.\n\nEddie Pineiro dressed as Cody Parkey this year \ud83c\udf83 pic.twitter.com/fp4EvZ0b7p \u2014 NFL Humor (@NFLHumor) October 27, 2019\n\nEveryone could be excused if they had a bit of deja vu, but Michael Wilbon, the noted Bears fan from ESPN\u2019s \u201cPTI,\u201d zeroed in on what he thinks is the Bears\u2019 problem.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDoes the Bears head coach want to ask again if he\u2019s an idiot? [As Nagy did during last week\u2019s news conference.] Because I know how I\u2019d answer him,\u201d Wilbon tweeted. \u201c \u2026 he won\u2019t run a play to get his kicker closer? Did that same idiot thing in Miami last year in a loss. Had time to run it and spike it or call time. Idiotic indeed. People don\u2019t want to hear this but the Chicago Bears have a much bigger problem than Trubiski [sic]. The head coach is the bigger problem. Curious how an offensive genius could turn down chances to get his kicker a chip shot and instead just let the clock run down.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHas Nagy conducted his postgame excuse-a-thon yet? Has he blamed the media for wondering if he\u2019s an idiot? (Hand in the air). Let me know when he points the finger at himself. As bad as Trubiski [sic] was (and he was largely bad) his coach was as bad if not worse.\u201d\n\nBears miss a 41-yard field goal for the game-winner! pic.twitter.com/S6bNWEJ0Oo \u2014 SNF on NBC (@SNFonNBC) October 27, 2019\n\nThe loss, Chicago\u2019s third in a row, drops the Bears to 3-4 on the season, which is last place in the NFC North. It also matches their loss total from last season, when they went 12-4 and won the division. Things don\u2019t figure to get much easier, with a road game at the Philadelphia Eagles up next before a home game versus the Detroit Lions and a road game at the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nRead more on the NFL from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "Eddy Pineiro misses game-winning field goal, but fans blame Coach Matt Nagy.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/NegNdSrjdSHCxkthfLxB-mLtDNg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DVBLMZXY7EI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
