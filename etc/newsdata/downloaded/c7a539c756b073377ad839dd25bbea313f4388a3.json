When he told them he couldn\u2019t \u2014 and wouldn't hand over his phone, from which he was playing his own music \u2014 they became aggressive, hurling expletives. \u201cThey told me I don\u2019t respect Polish culture,\u201d Roman recalled.\n\nHe decided to stop the car. After the drunken group got out, he started filming them. And that\u2019s when the fists began to fly. \u201cWe don\u2019t live in Ukraine, where everyone is fighting for a piece of bread, we live in Poland,\u201d they shouted at him.\n\nFor Roman \u2014 who ended up with injuries to his knee and head and a large bill for damages to his car \u2014 the violence was another example of the prejudice he and other Ukrainians face in the Polish capital.\n\nRoman, who is from the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, came to Poland as part of an influx of immigrants who fled the country after conflict erupted in the eastern Donbas region in 2014. It had become increasingly difficult to make a living in Ukraine. Poland, with its booming economy so close to home, was for many an obvious place to go.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that they are shooting at you in Donbass\" \u2014 Yuriy, a 47-year-old driver, was told at a car garage\n\nThe Polish government granted about 1.8 million temporary work permits to Ukrainians in 2018. The actual number of workers is smaller, however, as some have more than one document. The country is also home to some 200,000 Ukrainians on long-term residence permits, most of whom are between the ages of 20-39, according to government data.\n\nBut while the Polish economy was quick to absorb them to fill its own labor shortages, the insertion of so many Ukrainian workers into Polish society has been far less smooth.\n\n* * *\n\nFor the many Ukrainians who have turned to Uber as an easy way to find work, their interactions with Polish customers offer daily reminders of the precariousness of their position as outsiders.\n\nTheir foreign names \u2014 displayed on the app\u2019s screen when customers hail a car \u2014 and their accents make them immediately discernible as immigrants. When locals engage them in conversation, they often want to know where they are from. Often, the question comes from a place of hostility, not curiosity, said Roman.\n\n\u201cHalf, if not more, ask in order to show you that you\u2019re not a Pole,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t insult you, but I\u2019ll tell you that you\u2019re different.\u201d\n\nMany drivers have similar experiences. \u201cIt\u2019s good that they are shooting at you in Donbas,\u201d Yuriy, a 47-year-old driver, was told at a car garage.\n\nThe anti-Ukrainian rhetoric can be attributed at least in part to the rise of Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice party, said Myroslava Keryk, the head of Our Choice, a foundation that supports Ukrainians in Poland.\n\nThe party, which came into government in 2015 on the back of an anti-immigration campaign, \u201ccreated this aversion to foreigners and refugees,\u201d said Keryk.\n\nAlthough originally targeted at Muslim migrants, who the party claimed would bring Islam to Poland, the government\u2019s rhetoric has also clouded the way Poles regard Ukrainians in the country.\n\nPoland has seen a rise in violence against ethnic groups in the past few years, with hate crimes doubling between 2013 and 2016, according to data collected by the national prosecutor\u2019s office. Estimates from the human rights ombudsman put the number of hate crimes against Ukrainians in 2016 and 2017 in just one Polish region at 44,000.\n\nFor Ukrainians, this climate of fear is exacerbated by the historically strained relationship between the two nations.\n\nFor the most part, the drivers say they try to shrug off unpleasant incidents.\n\nPolish politicians don't hesitate to bring up mass killings of Polish civilians during World War II by Ukrainian insurgents allied with the Nazis. On social media, too, historical events are often used to disparage Ukrainians and paint them as inferior to Poles.\n\nNatalia Panchenko, who heads up Euromaidan Warsaw, an organization that runs an informational hotline for Ukrainians in Poland, said she didn\u2019t realize how deep-rooted xenophobia was in Poland until she started hearing from Ukrainian Uber drivers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s slowly becoming an everyday reality,\u201d although most Poles still don\u2019t notice there is a problem, she said.\n\nOn her daily commute, she sees the words \u201cUkrainians, leave Poland\u201d spray-painted on the side of a newsstand. It\u2019s been there for six months, she said. \u201cThousands of Ukrainians see that sign every day as they go to work.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nFor the most part, the drivers say they try to shrug off unpleasant incidents.\n\nIf anything, the drivers \u2014 a vast majority of whom work illegally \u2014 are more concerned about the precariousness of their jobs.\n\nUkrainians, along with several other post-Soviet nations, have easier access to the Polish labor market than other immigrants. Since 2017, they have been allowed to come into the country without visas. But for many, getting a work permit is not straightforward.\n\nDrivers who want to stay in Poland longer frequently speak of a bureaucratic limbo, where they have to wait for months to submit an application for a work permit \u2014 or more than a year for temporary residence papers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just here shopping,\u201d Andriy, a 39-year-old driver who\u2019s been in Poland for a year and a half, said with a sad smile.\n\n\u201cSome call what\u2019s been happening in the last two years administrative paralysis,\u201d said Monika Szulecka, sociologist at the Centre of Migration Studies at the University of Warsaw.\n\nRoman\u2019s wife went back to Ukraine to give birth to their baby, he said, because they were worried Polish bureaucracy would prevent them from getting medical insurance in time.\n\nFor those who opt to work for Uber, the bureaucracy around being formally self-employed \u2014 a pre-requisite for starting an Uber account \u2014 requires reams of extra paperwork and costs. It also makes it more difficult to get an official residence permit.\n\n\u201cI get racist comments sometimes. I cut them off immediately\" \u2014 Dmytro, a 27-year-old Uber driver\n\nMost opt to work for intermediary actors, so-called \u201cUber partners,\u201d who deal with the administrative side, and often rent cars to the drivers. Although in some cases these are legitimate companies authorized by Uber, stories of exploitation and cheating are common. Drivers say the partners sometimes withhold their wages, or simply disappear.\n\nOleksandr, 39, from Kyiv, said the partner company he worked for would charge him for new, made-up costs \u2014 for starting an account, for training. \u201cThey were swindlers,\u201d he said.\n\nUber itself operates in a gray legal area, and drivers worry about this. They want to be employed lawfully. (The first major effort to regulate Uber passed this year, and will take effect in 2020.)\n\nThe only way to make a decent living driving for Uber is to work long hours, they say, and even then, it can be hit or miss. The drivers have little time to do anything else \u2014 or to try to integrate with Polish society.\n\n* * *\n\nRoman now works as a cab driver, where he said the clients are better-behaved, and where he has the power of a taxi corporation behind him.\n\nAnd many drivers say they intend on staying in Poland.\n\n\u201cIn Ukraine, things are looking grim,\u201d said Oleksandr, who used to own a company that made plaster d\u00e9cor for buildings and did work on a boat-shaped restaurant in the residence of former President Viktor Yanukoyvch. After the 2014 Maidan protests that ousted the leader, his clients fled.\n\nOthers are more optimistic about prospects back home.\n\nRuslan, who is 25, came to Poland to save money for his business venture: vending machines that sell custom sports drinks. In the Ukrainian presidential election in April, he voted for comedian-turned-politician Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and said he\u2019s hopeful things will start to change.\n\nIn the meantime, the drivers are sanguine about the mood in Poland.\n\nAlthough the country has historically been one of emigration, not immigration \u2014 providing cheap labor to countries like the United Kingdom, Germany and France \u2014 many Poles are now worried that cheap Ukrainian labor will keep wages low.\n\nPeople who have seen family members and friends leave for better jobs in Western Europe want to see employers raise salaries to lure them back. \u201cWhy do my children have to live in the West, while only Ukrainians work here,\u201d Szulecka, from the University of Warsaw, said, summarizing the mood among many Poles.\n\nThe irony of the situation is not lost on those who are backfilling Poland\u2019s labor needs.\n\n\u201cI get racist comments sometimes. I cut them off immediately,\u201d said Dmytro, a 27-year-old Uber driver. \u201cHe can go to London and see all the Poles there, he can go to Germany and see all the Poles there. This is how the world works, some people go and leave for a better life.\u201d\n\nHanna Kozlowska is a reporter based in New York, covering technology and social issues.
