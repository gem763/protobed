It has denied any connection with animal trafficking.\n\nCurrently, there are 400 deer, more than 300 peacocks, a lion and several other animals under its care legally.\n\nThai authorities maintained on Monday that the tigers were well taken care of at government sanctuaries and that they caught diseases like canine distemper virus or laryngeal paralysis because inbreeding had destroyed their immune system.\n\n\"There were six tigers (originally at the temple) and later that became 147 or even more, so there were always the risks and also we found that their health were not good to begin with,\" Pattarapol Maneeorn, a wildlife veterinarian for the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation said Monday.\n\n\"Their genetics have made their body weak and susceptible to the risk of infection,\" he told a news conference.
