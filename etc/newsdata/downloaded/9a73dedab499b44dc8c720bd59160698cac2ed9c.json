What\u2019s it like eating rabbit food?\u2019\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard this kind of line if you\u2019re a vegan or occasionally dwell on the plant-based side of life. It\u2019s something that an out-of-touch uncle will bring up at a family gathering, and he\u2019ll probably repeat it because it\u2019s such a classic gag.\n\nYou\u2019ll get less of this kind of scintillating chat in London, a city where you can indulge in the full gamut of vegan dining.\n\nIn fact, Londoners are three times more likely to order vegan comfort food than anyone else in the UK. According to Deliveroo, there\u2019s been a 68% increase in vegan food delivery orders in London over the past six months.\n\nWhile you\u2019re probably more inclined to order-in during these dire, chilly months, actually leaving the house might boost your mood more than festering on your couch will. So, here\u2019s where to head for a greasy, creamy, fried, melted, oozing hug of a meal. Because Uncle Bernie, vegans love junk food too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor vegan mozzarella sticks\u2026\n\nUnity Diner, Spitalfields\n\nUnity Diner is a one-stop-shop for vegan comfort food. Founded by vegan activist Ed Winters (Earthling Ed), they serve up indulgent mozzarella sticks created from coconut-based cheese with a herby panko coating. If you\u2019re feasting, the hash brown fries and tofish bites are also a tasty treat.\n\nThe non-profit diner and bar, which has just reopened at a new site in Spitalfields, directs their profits to Surge, a grassroots animal rights organisation. You\u2019ll also be delighted to know that their diner is doggo-friendly.\n\nFor vegan burritos\u2026\n\n\n\nClub Mexicana, Shoreditch\n\nAs any comfort food enthusiast knows, burritos are angelic parcels of delectability. It\u2019s a humble dish that packs sauciness, crunch, and heavy carbs into a perfectly-folded parcel, which is particularly comforting when you\u2019re a brutally hungover wreck.\n\nSo, kick off your seedy Sunday with Club Mexicana\u2019s big brunch burrito, a bulky package of vegan chorizo\u2019, tempeh bacon, triple fried potatoes, black beans, guacamole, salsa, slaw and hot sauce.\n\nFor vegan fish and chips\u2026\n\nCanvas Caf\u00e9, Brick Lane\n\nTime for the British classic with a plant-based update.

Try the parmigiana pie that packs a tangy, creamy bite or the chicken katsu curry pie if you\u2019re in the mood for a winter warmer. The pie shop also reveals their weekly specials via their cravings-summoning Instagram account.\n\nFor vegan pizza\u2026\n\nYard Sale, Hackney\n\nPizza chain Yard Sale all started with a backyard pizza oven and a few weekly supper clubs with friends. Last month, they launched their fifth London site, where locals can come to enjoy their sumptuous \u2018Texas VBQ\u2019 pizza featuring plant-based chicken nuggos, homemade BBQ sauce, guindilla chillies and vegan mayo.\n\nWith the opening of their new Hackney branch, they also introduced new line-up of calzones, including a vegan calzone with black beans, vegan mozzarella, pink onions and smashed avo.\n\nFor vegan burgers\u2026\n\nThe Vurger Co, Shoreditch\n\nVegan burgers are no longer limited to supermarket patties.

Did we mention they\u2019ve also got a melt-in-your-mouth vegan poutine?\n\nFor vegan baked goods\u2026\n\nCookies and Scream, Highbury East\n\nEven looking at a visual of oozing chocolate can be as comforting as devouring it. But why stop there? London bakery Cookies and Scream kicked off operations in 2010, going on to make a name for themselves with their decadent selection of vegan cookies, brownies, and donuts.\n\nWhile their original Camden Market store closed down due to a fire, they\u2019re still serving up baked delights at their Holloway Road shop.\n\nFor vegan ice cream\u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYorica, Soho\n\nLast but not least, it\u2019s one of the most uplifting, satisfying dishes out: ice cream.
