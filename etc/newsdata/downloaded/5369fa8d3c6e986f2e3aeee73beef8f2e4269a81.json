Still, it is almost an open secret that the U.S. has as many as 50 B-61 bombs stored under heavy guard at Incirlik air base in southern Turkey.\n\nPresident Donald Trump implicitly acknowledged the stockpile this week when asked by a reporter how confident he was of the bombs\u2019 security.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident,\u201d he said.\n\nTurkey, a NATO ally, has reportedly hosted American nuclear weapons for 60 years. The bombs could be dropped by U.S. planes in a nuclear war. The arrangement at Incirlik air base is part of NATO\u2019s policy of linking Turkey and other member countries to the alliance\u2019s aim of deterring war by having a relatively small number of nuclear weapons based in Europe. Removing them, therefore, would be a diplomatic complication.\n\nThere is no known evidence that the nuclear weapons at Incirlik are at direct risk, but relations between Washington and Ankara are at perhaps a historic low and the war in Syria has grown more complex and unpredictable. Incirlik is about 150 miles from Syria by road.\n\nThursday\u2019s announced U.S. deal with Turkey to pause its offensive against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria may have slowed the deterioration of relations. But the overall direction has been decidedly and increasingly negative.\n\n\u201cThe arc of their behavior over the past several years has been terrible,\u201d Defense Secretary Mark Esper said last Sunday, noting that Ankara defied repeated U.S. warnings not to purchase a Russian air defense system that the White House has likened to a portal for Russian spying. He added: \u201cI mean, they are spinning out of the Western orbit, if you will.\u201d\n\nIn July, the Pentagon kicked Turkey out of its F-35 fighter jet program because Turkey refused to halt its purchase of the Russian-made air defense system. This was a major blow to U.S.-Turkey relations and raised questions in Washington about whether Turkey was a reliable ally.\n\nEric Edelman, a former U.S. ambassador to Turkey and senior Pentagon official, said Friday he believes the nuclear weapons are safe and secure. He sees risk in removing them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in favor of taking any actions that would potentially accelerate Turkey\u2019s thinking about pursuing its own independent nuclear deterrent,\u201d he said, noting that Erdogan as recently as September mentioned this possibility.\n\nSome American arms control experts say the U.S. bombs at Incirlik would be safer in another NATO member country.\n\nHans Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists, who has followed the issue for many years, said in an interview that a review of options for the U.S. bombs at Incirlik, near the city of Adana, is long overdue. He believes the Air Force, which is responsible for the bombs, has grown concerned about their security in recent years.\n\n\u201cThe Air Force is concerned about not only the standard physical perimeters \u2014 whether they are good enough \u2014 but also about the manpower on the base, whether they have enough to hold back an attack from someone,\u201d Kristensen said.\n\nThe conflict in northern Syria, which has only grown more complex and unpredictable with a U.S. troop withdrawal, has added a new layer of worry for American officials, he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re afraid of the spillover\u201d inside Turkey, he said.\n\nThe Pentagon has declined to comment on the matter.\n\n\u201cIt is U.S. policy to neither confirm nor deny the presence or absence of nuclear weapons at any general or specific location,\u201d said Air Force Lt. Col. Uriah Orland, a Pentagon spokesman. \u201cThe U.S. does not discuss the movement of nuclear weapons, the capability to store weapons at U.S. or foreign locations or planning for any of these activities.\u201d\n\nEven private experts who study the matter are not sure how many weapons are stored there, but Kristensen believes there are up to 50 B-61 bombs designed to be dropped by U.S. fighter aircraft. He says the U.S. has had nuclear weapons in Turkey continuously since 1959.\n\nThe bombs in Turkey are part of a network of roughly 150 U.S. air-delivered nuclear weapons based in Europe. Kristensen says the host countries, in addition to Turkey, are Belgium, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday he and Trump share \u201clove and respect,\u201d but he also let little doubt that he was offended by an Oct. 9 letter from Trump telling Erdogan, \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool!\u201d\n\nErdogan told reporters Trump\u2019s words were not compatible with \u201cpolitical and diplomatic courtesy\u201d and would not be forgotten. He said he would \u201cdo what\u2019s necessary\u201d about the letter \u201cwhen the time comes.\u201d He did not elaborate.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Frayed U.S. relations with Turkey over its incursion in Syria raise a sensitive question rarely discussed in public: Should the United", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/19/809718_us-turkey-nukes-07043-file-in-dec-15-2015-file-photo-air-force-15-fighter-jet-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
