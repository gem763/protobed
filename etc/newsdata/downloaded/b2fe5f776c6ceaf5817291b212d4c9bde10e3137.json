With this broad a field, it is interesting to watch how each candidate chooses to separate themselves from the pack: Elizabeth Warren with her four-hour selfie lines, Andrew Yang with his pledge to hand out $1,000 to each adult American, and so on.\n\nBut not all of these publicity stunts are home runs. Today, Sen. Kamala Harris penned a letter\u2014on a campaign letterhead, no less\u2014to Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, asking him to boot President Donald Trump off of Dorsey\u2019s platform.\n\nHarris doesn\u2019t realize what a massive blunder this is for her campaign. There is already a culture on the right diametrically opposed to any social media censorship. Her letter encouraging such bias will only energize the right against her.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe circumstantial evidence surrounding alleged left-wing bias in Silicon Valley will be all the more strengthened by the removal of the president from a prominent social media platform \u2014 not to mention the fact that Harris is calling for the silencing of her political opponent\u2019s speech. The White House has asserted that Harris\u2019s appeal to Dorsey was \u201cauthoritarian\u201d in nature, and I agree.\n\nSen. Harris\u2019 letter is also a lousy campaign strategy. She\u2019s attacking a great source of political fodder. Trump tweets are incredibly easy targets; they may as well be gift-wrapped with fundraising bows. Losing Trump\u2019s tweets may go a long way to appease the relatively small number of radical #Resistance members who exist on Twitter, but having that accessible a target is useful to maintain momentum in a primary. And what would the loss of President Trump\u2019s Twitter access mean for the population at large?\n\nPolitical or not, every single American has an opinion on Trump\u2019s Twitter account. Many on the right love Trump\u2019s tweets because they are a reflection of his true self, rarely seen outside of his massive rallies: unfiltered, raw, and presidential, for better or worse. Others on the right tolerate Trump tweets as a matter of free speech principle. Still others join the rest of the nation in condemnation of the language and tone Trump\u2019s tweets exhibit.\n\nDespite my personal dislike of Trump\u2019s tweets, I love that we, as a populace, can have more direct access to our politicians these days. Social media allows us to have intimate encounters with the leaders of our country on a scale technologically unheard of just 20 years ago. Social media is the pinnacle of humanity\u2019s need to communicate, and the specifically political application of social media is incredibly formidable.\n\nCircumventing the press to bring the message straight to the people used to be nearly impossible. Taking that kind of platform away from the President isn\u2019t just punishing him; it\u2019s punishing the American people who would no longer be able to see the President\u2019s reactions immediately, sans spin.\n\nSen. Harris\u2019 letter comes at a time when American rhetoric is reaching peak heights of awful. Social media has done a lot of good to bring us together, and it also contributes to the massive partisan split in the country. But which is better: more words or less?\n\nFor me, I will always choose more words, more free speech, and more debate. To advocate for the silencing of political opponents, even on a private platform, is antithetical to the principles the First Amendment was founded on. And coming from Harris, a former prosecutor, the cold shoulder she is giving to the Constitution in her actions speaks much louder than her letter.\n\nAlec Sears (@Alec_Sears) is a conservative writer based in Washington DC", "description": "Candidates in the Democratic 2020 presidential primary race are pulling all the stops to differentiate themselves from their competitors.", "authors": ["Alec Sears"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/15/16/kamalaharris-0.jpg"}
