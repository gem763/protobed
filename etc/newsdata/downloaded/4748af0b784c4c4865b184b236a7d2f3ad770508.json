Facebook\u2019s policy for pages of this kind revolve around prohibiting \u201cmisleading, fraudulent or deceptive\u201d information, and they \u201cmust not facilitate or promote online gambling, online real money, games of skill, or online lotteries without our prior written permission.\u201d None of these apply to the content we produce and distribute.\n\nOur Instagram page remained live and active throughout this time, even though Facebook owns that company as well.\n\nA Facebook rep shared via email that the Cointelegraph page was unpublished in error and is live once again. That means there\u2019s never been a better time to visit us on Facebook and give us a like.", "description": "After a month of inaccessibility, Cointelegraph\u2019s Facebook page has been unblocked and will return to keeping you informed on the latest in crypto immediately", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8yNWYwZTMzYWRjNGVmODRhZGE5YTAwYzc2NmM3MTc5Yi5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
