It's only 3km [2 miles] but [it took] two days to cover 3km. I was thinking that I was never going to get there.\"\n\nDevising a 'self-rescue'\n\nMr Parker had been planning a three-hour hike at Mount Nebo when rocks gave way beneath his feet and he tumbled down the waterfall.\n\n\"I slid about 20 feet, cartwheeled and slammed into the rock and then landed in the creek on the bottom,\" he said.\n\n\"And I thought, 'the only way to get rescued is self-rescue.'\"\n\nAn experienced bushwalker, Mr Parker had packed first aid supplies including bandages which he combined with hiking sticks to splint his leg.\n\nHe also had painkillers and access to water, but only limited food: nuts, sweets and an energy bar.\n\nMr Parker said he was \"scrambling and lifting, inch-by-inch\" to get to the clearing, hampered by the injuries on opposite sides of his body.\n\n\"I had to carry my leg - and legs are very heavy when they're not connected to anything - and [I was] trying to pick it up and get over rock and then use this elbow and this arm and just constantly struggling,\" he said.\n\nHe said thinking of his family gave him the mental strength to keep going, saying: \"I wanted to be around for my kids.\"\n\nYou might also be interested in:\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Rescued from quicksand after 12 hours - a US hiker describes his ordeal in February\n\nMr Parker was finally spotted by a helicopter and winched to safety on Tuesday, before being taken to a hospital in Brisbane.\n\nOrthopaedic surgeon Nicola Ward told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that Mr Parker was doing \"extremely well\".\n\n\"I've never heard any such survival effort with two broken limbs,\" she said, adding he faced at least eight weeks of recovery.", "description": "Neil Parker began his agonising trip to safety after falling 6m (20ft) down a waterfall in Australia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/66B6/production/_108849262_9b5e224c-5cfa-45f8-bd3f-27ab5d3287e6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
