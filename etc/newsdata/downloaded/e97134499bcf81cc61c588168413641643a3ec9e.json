Sign up here.\n\nNestle SA plans to return as much as $20 billion to shareholders by 2022 and indicated an appetite for acquisitions to help Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider sustain faster growth and better profit margins.\n\nFlush with cash after the $10 billion sale of a dermatology unit earlier this month, the Swiss food giant said Thursday that it will start a new share buyback program in January and may complement it with special dividends over the next three years. It\u2019s also reorganizing its bottled-water business after a sales decline.\n\nSchneider is wrapping up his third year at the head of the food giant, during which Nestle\u2019s market value has increased by almost $80 billion. The maker of Nescafe and KitKat bars has bought more than 20 companies under the CEO, the first outsider to gain the position in almost a century. He has axed about 4,000 jobs involved in frozen-food delivery in the U.S. and helped put the company on track for savings of 1.9 billion francs ($1.9 billion) this year.\n\nNestle signaled it\u2019s sharpening its M&A focus further as it unveiled a new management group that will seek out growth opportunities, to be led by Sanjay Bahadur, a 37-year corporate veteran who has been head of acquisitions for the past decade and finance director for Greater China before that.\n\nThe company said it\u2019s restructuring its bottled water unit, where nine-month sales declined as tough competition attracted consumers away from Nestle\u2019s low-end brands. Nestle Waters will no longer run as a separate business and will instead be integrated into Nestle\u2019s three main geographical zones.\n\nSchneider said Nestle will focus its portfolio on faster-growing brands of sparkling and flavored waters like Perrier and S. Pellegrino.\n\n\u201cThe water category is one that tends to growth of 5% to 7% in most years,\u201d he said on a call with reporters. \u201cWe can adjust our portfolio over time to benefit in a better way from the growth the category has to offer.\u201d\n\nShares of Nestle fell as much as 0.6% in morning trading. Europe\u2019s largest company by market value reported nine-month sales growth of 3.7%, in line with analysts\u2019 estimates, helped by Starbucks-branded coffee for Nespresso machines and Purina pet food.\n\nThird-quarter volume growth was the strongest since 2011, according to Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Andrew Wood. However, pricing dropped by 0.2% in the period, the worst performance in years. Nestle said the softness is temporary.\n\nThe new buyback comes as Nestle\u2019s shares trade at record levels, and the size exceeded MainFirst analyst Alain Oberhuber\u2019s estimate of 12 billion francs.\n\nNestle said it would prefer to make investments to expand its main businesses, and it may scale down the 20 billion-franc target if any sizable acquisitions pop up. Schneider joined Nestle from Fresenius, a German medical company he expanded through a wave of acquisitions.\n\nJon Cox, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux, has said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see bolt-on deals in areas management has highlighted for attention: coffee, water, pet care, nutrition and consumer health.\n\n(Updates with details on Bahadur in fourth paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Corinne Gretler in Zurich at cgretler1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Eric Pfanner at epfanner1@bloomberg.net, Thomas Mulier, Marthe Fourcade\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets?
