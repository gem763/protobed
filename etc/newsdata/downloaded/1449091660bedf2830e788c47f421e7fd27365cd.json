So, I didn\u2019t watch him as a collegiate player. With him in Oakland and me in the NFC, I didn\u2019t really see him play a lot.\n\n\u201cThen when we got him and it was just after a few days, it was like \u2026 \u2018Holy crap!\u2019\u201d\n\nMack made quite the first impression with the Bears, getting a sack, an interception, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery against the Green Bay Packers 24 hours after the trade. He finished the year with 12\u00bd sacks and a career-best six forced fumbles in helping the Bears to a 12-4 record and their first playoff appearance in eight seasons.\n\nIn the playoffs, Mack had a tackle for loss and two quarterback hits in the Bears\u2019 stunning 16-15 loss at home to the Eagles, after which the Bears lost their defensive mastermind when John Elway gave Fangio his first head coaching job at age 60 .\n\nWith Fangio taking his disguised pass coverage philosophies to Denver, Chuck Pagano took over Chicago\u2019s defense, which remained dominant in a 10-3 loss to Green Bay last week. Mack didn\u2019t harass Aaron Rodgers like he did a year ago, although his teammates had five sacks as the longtime rivals kicked off the NFL\u2019s 100th season.\n\nVon Miller didn\u2019t touch Derek Carr in Denver\u2019s 24-16 loss at Oakland, and he wasn\u2019t alone: The Broncos failed to hit an opposing quarterback for the first time since Dec. 14, 2014, at San Diego.\n\nFangio said Miller actually had a pretty good game, especially against the run, but Miller was critical of his performance.\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t get a sack, I\u2019m going to be upset. That\u2019s just how it is,\u201d said Miller, who leads the league with 98 sacks since his rookie year in 2011. \u201cIf I don\u2019t get a sack and then we lose on top of that, it\u2019s a double loss for me. That\u2019s my job and I like to get my job done.\u201d\n\nMiller and Mack will be seeking their first sacks Sunday in the surprising matchup of division cellar dwellers.\n\nOther subplots in the Bears\u2019 first visit to Denver since 2011 and the first game at the newly renamed Empower Field at Mile High :\n\nHOMECOMING KING\n\nOne of Fangio\u2019s favorite pupils in Chicago was ILB Danny Trevathan, who played in Denver from 2012-15, serving as the tone setter for the Super Bowl 50 champs.\n\n\u201cI really enjoyed coaching Danny,\u201d Fangio said, describing him as a \u201cfiery guy \u2026 who really likes to play football, which is contagious to everybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s who he is,\u201d Bears coach Matt Nagy said. \u201cI think specifically after a tough loss like we just came off, you look for guys that can naturally take over. He is a born leader.\u201d\n\nDAVIS DEBUT ?\n\nBroncos linebacker Todd Davis hopes to make his 2019 debut Sunday after missing two months with a torn calf. Denver\u2019s leading tackler last year, Davis said he\u2019s always tried to emulate Trevathan\u2019s attitude.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a tough, nasty player and that\u2019s what I love about him,\u201d Davis said.\n\nIn which case, Davis does a good impression of Trevathan, Miller said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s our thug,\u201d Miller said. \u201cEvery team\u2019s got to have one and Todd is ours.\u201d\n\nPASS PROTECTION\n\nTrying to keep Mack and Leonard Floyd off QB Joe Flacco are LT Garett Bolles, Denver\u2019s 2017 first-round pick who\u2019s been flagged 30 times in 33 NFL starts, and undrafted RT Elijah Wilkinson, subbing for prized free agent acquisition Ja\u2019Wuan James (knee).\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s still a work in progress,\u201d Fangio said of Bolles. \u201cBut I think the future\u2019s very bright for him.\u201d\n\nFANT\u2019S FLOP\n\nAfter his disappointing debut, rookie tight end Noah Fant said, \u201cI expect more from myself.\u201d\n\nSo do the Broncos, who used the 20th overall pick on the Iowa tight end who caught two passes for 29 yards but cost Denver 31 yards in losses: 5 on a jet sweep that fizzled on OC Rich Scangarello\u2019s first play call, and 26 on two penalties.\n\nCHICAGO COUNTERPUNCH\n\nBears QB Mitch Trubisky has a history of bouncing back from poor performances. \u201cSometimes the ball just doesn\u2019t bounce your way but you\u2019ve just got to bounce back,\u201d said Trubisky, who is 8-1 following a game in which his rating was 77.2 or lower. He had a 62.1 rating against Green Bay.\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "This time, Vic Fangio knows exactly what he's getting in Khalil Mack's arrival.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Arnie Stapleton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/bears_broncos_preview_football_58596_c0-136-3500-2176_s1770x1032.jpg?40b390fe166cae563aef92821e83bf13d1eb940b"}
