Ryan Garza, Detroit Free Press\n\nDETROIT \u2014 The future of General Motors' assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, has been a friction point between GM and the UAW since even before negotiations for a new contract began this summer, and now could pose a threat to ratification of a tentative agreement.\n\nAbout 40 to 50 UAW members gathered Thursday outside Detroit's Renaissance Center ahead of the UAW National GM Council meeting, as well as inside the Marriott hotel where the meeting was held, chanting \u201cno product, no vote.\u201c\n\nAs UAW leaders Gary Jones and Terry Dittes descended the escalator to enter the ballroom ahead of the meeting, the protesters again shouted: \u201cNo product, no vote\u201c and \u201cStop giving our jobs to Mexico!\u201d\n\nReports on the Lordstown plant's fate conflicted after the union and GM reached a proposed tentative agreement. The Wall Street Journal reported the automaker would invest, with partners, $1.3 billion near the idled factory. Other accounts said Lordstown was left out of the pact. The Journal report squares with the USA TODAY Network's Detroit Free Press reporting on a battery plant planned near the factory, while GM works to sell the plant to an enterprise linked to electric truck maker Workhorse Group of suburban Cincinnati.\n\nFrom left: Bill Goodchild and Justin Brown both of Local 1112 from Lordstown Assembly Plant in Lordstown, Ohio at the Renaissance Center in downtown Detroit on Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019.

He worked 11 years at the Lordstown plant before transferring to GM\u2019s plant in Wentzville five months ago.\n\n\u201cI left my home and everything there in Lordstown,\" said Brown. \u201cIf there\u2019s nothing in this contract for Lordstown, my vote is no. If they won\u2019t give it to us now, then I don\u2019t think we should settle the contract.\u201d\n\nMany members of the GM Lordstown Assembly Plant in Lordstown, Ohio gather at the Renaissance Center in downtown Detroit on Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019, ahead of the GM-UAW vote on a new contract.

He said if the 46,000 members are \u201ctrue union brothers and sisters and know the meaning of solidarity, they\u2019ll stick with us\u201d and reject the proposed tentative contract.\n\nUAW Local 1112 President @TimOHara1112 is prepared to vote no on a contract that doesn\u2019t include a product for #Lordstown. \u201cToday it\u2019s us. Tomorrow it could be somebody else.\u201d @MahoningMatterspic.twitter.com/oIqix6dUOJ \u2014 Jess Hardin (@jesslhardin) October 17, 2019\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s no product for Lordstown, my vote is no,\u201d said William Goodchild, a laid-off Lordstown worker who came to GM\u2019s headquarters to make sure UAW leaders know the Lordstown issue matters.\n\nGoodchild, Wolikow, Brown and others at the rally said they are ready to stay on strike longer if need be to get a product for Lordstown. But Wolikow worries that some union members will see \u201cthe big carrot\u201d GM has offered in the form of a ratification bonus of at least $9,000 and \u201cbe bought out\u201d to ratify a tentative contract if the National GM Council recommends ratification.\n\nLordstown Mayor Arno Hill, who retired as a tool and die maker from Delphi Packard Electric Systems in 2004, said he had not been briefed by General Motors as of 10 a.m. Thursday.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had a heads up on anything,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI\u2019m sure with GM their priority now is to get an agreement with the UAW.\u201d\n\nRight now, he said, much of the speculation is focusing on a scenario where the Workhorse buys the factory. The belief, he said, is that no product has been allocated by GM to Lordstown but nothing has been confirmed.\n\nGM in November 2018 angered the UAW when it announced plans to idle four U.S. plants, including Lordstown, which shut down earlier this year when production of the small Chevrolet Cruze ended.\n\nThe decision was a sore point with President Donald Trump, who had promised workers during a 2017 rally in nearby Youngstown that he would protect manufacturing jobs. \"Don't move. Don't sell your house,\" he said.\n\nAfter GM's announcement last year, Trump periodically pressured GM and the UAW to find a way to keep the factory open, at one point hailing the Workhorse possibility as a savior for the plant.\n\nPresident @realDonaldTrump, Senator @robportman, and Governor @MikeDeWine have been committed to working with G.M. to find a solution for Lordstown. Today, they announced that G.M. has sold the plant to Cincy based WorkHorse \u2014 Ohio Republicans (@ohiogop) May 8, 2019\n\nLordstown Motors is a new enterprise affiliated with Workhorse's former CEO. It is trying to arrange financing to buy the plant, and while GM and others have said talks continue on that possibility and express optimism, it's unclear whether or when a deal might come to fruition.\n\nSeveral former Lordstown workers, transferred to other GM plants, have held to Trump's promise and not sold their homes, commuting to new jobs in locations such as Flint and Lansing in Michigan.\n\nMike Yakim, 51, a 25-year GM employee, is one of them. He was featured in a Free Press story during the early days of the strike about his commuting from Lansing to Lordstown and picketing in both locations.\n\nYakim was at the Renaissance Center on Thursday.\n\n\"We feel violated by General Motors and hope that the UAW doesn\u2019t betray our trust in them,\" he said. He vowed to vote against the proposed contract if it does not commit a product to Lordstown.\n\nMike Yakim at the empty GM Lordstown Assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio on Wednesday, Sept. 18, 2019. (Photo: Eric Seals, Detroit Free Press)\n\nTentative agreement provisions\n\nKnown provisions of the proposed tentative agreement include:\n\nUAW-represented GM workers will get a bonus of more than $9,000 upon ratification of the deal.\n\nGM will invest in U.S. facilities to create and retain 9,000 jobs.\n\n3-4% wage and lump-sum increases in alternating years.\n\nAs part of that investment, the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Plant will be retooled to build an electric pickup.\n\nTemporary workers, who have been paid $15-19 an hour with inferior benefits to permanent autoworkers, get a path to a permanent role.\n\nNewer union workers with two weeks' vacation a year will get to take one of those weeks at their choosing. In the previous contract, these employees were required to take both paid vacation weeks during scheduled plant shutdowns. The second week of a plant shutdown would be considered a layoff, qualifying workers for unemployment.\n\nFollow Detroit Free Press reporter Jamie LaReau on Twitter @jlareauan.
