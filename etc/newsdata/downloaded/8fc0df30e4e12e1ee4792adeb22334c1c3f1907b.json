The soaring price has hit Chinese consumers hard as pork, essential in most Chinese households, accounts for more than 60% of meat consumption.\n\nChina raises about half of the world\u2019s pigs, and stable pork production is of great importance to people\u2019s well-being and a steady national economic performance, said Yu Kangzhen, vice minister of agriculture and rural affairs.\n\nThe implementation of these policies will play a powerful role in mobilizing farmers, promoting breeding and ensuring the pork supply in the market, he said.\n\nPork production fell as African swine fever ravaged pig farms in China beginning in April. While the disease doesn\u2019t infect humans, it spreads among pigs quickly.\n\nOn Monday, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and the National Development and Reform Commission jointly announced subsidies of up to 5 million yuan ($700,000) for large pig farms to construct new facilities.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "China is launching a nationwide initiative to boost pork production following a price spike blamed on a devastating outbreak of African swine fever.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/11/china_pork_production_34117_c0-209-5000-3124_s1770x1032.jpg?d90e3d455f0268dece892f6c8cc4108909694c0b", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
