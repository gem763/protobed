Pictured, artist's impression of the black-hole collision\n\nThe detection of the huge event was enabled by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO).\n\nThe collision's gravitational waves were detected after passing through Earth on July 29 last year.\n\nDetection of the principle wave was then followed by signs of three smaller black hole mergers in August.\n\nIt brings the total number of black hole merger detections to ten, along with a neutron star collision, during the past three years.\n\nAn international team, led by dozens of Austrian astronomers, have detected the event and Professor Susan Scott says she has spent most of her career hoping to detect such gravitational waves\n\nShe said that technology advancements were finally giving scientists answers.\n\nThis event also had black holes spinning the fastest of all mergers observed so far and it is the most distant merger in the universe ever observed, Professor Scott said.\n\nA NASA simulation of two spinning black holes\n\n'We can't see these events any other way except through gravitational waves, as they don't emit light or radio waves ... because they're black holes,' she said.\n\nThe binary systems, meaning two black holes orbiting each other, eventually smash together and radiate strong gravitational waves which are very faint by the time they reach earth, said Professor Scott, from the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Gravitational Wave Discovery (OzGrav).\n\nWHAT ARE GRAVITATIONAL WAVES? Scientists view the the universe as being made up of a 'fabric of space-time'. This corresponds to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, published in 1916. Objects in the universe bend this fabric, and more massive objects bend it more. Gravitational waves are considered ripples in this fabric. Gravitational waves are considered ripples in the fabric of spacetime. They can be produced, for instance, when black holes orbit each other or by the merging of galaxies They can be produced, for instance, when black holes orbit each other or by the merging of galaxies. Gravitational waves are also thought to have been produced during the Big Bang. Scientists first detected the shudders in space-time in 2016 and the discovery was hailed the 'biggest scientific breakthrough of the century'. Experts say gravitational waves open a 'new door' for observing the universe and gaining knowledge about enigmatic objects like black holes and neutron stars.\n\nAstronomers have discovered the largest ever collision of binary black holes happened nine billion years ago. It was one of the most cataclysmic events in the universe and was detected from wrinkles in space and time, known as gravitational waves (stock)\n\nThe detections will improve scientists' understanding of how many binary black hole systems there are in the universe and the range of their masses and how fast they spin during a merger, she said.\n\nResearchers plan to use LIGO's technology to detect cataclysmic events even further out in space, in the hopes they can reach back to the beginning of time.\n\nThe next observation run to collect data will begin early next year, following work to make the gravitational wave detector more sensitive.\n\nProfessor Scott will present the recent results at the Australian Institute of Physics Congress in Perth later this month.\n\n'This should be the biggest announcement at the whole congress ... it's a pinnacle of my career,' she added.\n\nGas surrounding a supermassive black hole spews out from above and below the disk like a three-dimensional fountain, new simulations have revealed\n\nDr Karl Wette, a postdoctoral fellow in the group at ANU and a member of OzGrav, said scientists were not sure what was formed from the neutron-star merger that was detected in August last year.\n\n'It could have been a neutron star that collapsed to a black hole after some time or turned immediately into a black hole,' he said.\n\n'Our new project will help to provide critical information about what we get from the merger of two neutron stars.'\n\nThe results of the discoveries will be published in Physical Review X.", "description": "One of the most cataclysmic events in the universe has been detected by Australian astronomers despite barely making a ripple through earth.", "authors": ["Joe Pinkstone For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/12/04/17/7002612-0-image-a-15_1543946143344.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-03"}
