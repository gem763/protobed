Ryan Ford, Detroit Free Press\n\nVladimir Konstantinov, a former Detroit Red Wings defenseman, picked out the shirt and tie he will wear Saturday night when he is inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame.\n\n\u201cHe is very excited about Saturday,\u201d said James Bellanca Jr., Konstantinov\u2019s longtime lawyer and friend. \u201cHe knows something special is happening. Whether he can comprehend the meaning of it, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s the part that breaks your heart.\n\nKonstantinov is one of the most beloved athletes in Detroit sports history. He was known as the Vladinator, a tough, physical defender from Russia who helped the Wings win the 1997 Stanley Cup, ending a 42-year drought.\n\nBut he is also one of the most tragic athletes in Detroit sports history, suffering a career-ending, life-threatening spinal cord injury in a limo crash just six days after winning the Cup.\n\nTwenty-two years later, Konstantinov lives in a condo in West Bloomfield, Michigan, where he gets the best care available. His wife and daughter live in Florida but visit regularly. He requires 24-hour assistance from a team of caregivers, who have been with him for years. \u201cI think he\u2019s happy,\u201d Bellanca said. \u201cThere are three or four ladies who take care of him, most of whom have been with him for 18 or 20 years. Those ladies are wonderful. They treat him like their child.\u201d\n\nVladimir Konstantinov, former Detroit Red Wing, smiles as his wife Irina looks on from the right, during a brief news conference at Joe Louis Arena, Saturday, May 30, 1998.

Most of the caregivers speak Russian because he has a tendency to mix English with his native tongue. \u201cHe speaks both Russian and English, not very much of either, but he can communicate, and he responds to either,\u201d Bellanca said. \u201cI think he\u2019s comfortable with his surroundings and the people who take care of him.\u201d\n\nKonstantinov lives a simple life. He goes to rehab, spends time at Costco \u2014 he enjoys shopping \u2014 likes to go bowling and thoroughly enjoys being around people. He can get around using a walker and loves to play Uno, the card game.\n\n\u201cHe cheats!\u201d Bellanca said, laughing.\n\n'That part of his brain is gone'\n\nBellanca sits in a corner office at his law firm in Harper Woods, Michigan. He faces a computer and clicks on a video about Konstantinov, which was made for a court case.\n\nNobody from the public has ever seen it, Bellanca says.\n\n\u201cA lot of people who knew him well would say, \u2018If he\u2019s not the perfect guy, he\u2019s almost the perfect one,' \u201d Irina Konstantinov, Vladdy\u2019s wife, said in the video. \u201cHonest. Hard-working. Good to everyone. I don\u2019t think he ever hurt anyone in his life, either physically or emotionally, except maybe on the ice.\u201d\n\nIrina will not be attending the Hall of Fame induction because she is heading to Russia to care for her elderly mother, Bellanca said. And though she declined an interview request from the Free Press, Irina did give Bellanca permission to show the video to the newspaper.\n\n\u201cEvery day, when he wakes up, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s aware of what\u2019s wrong with him,\u201d she said in the video.\n\nVladdy was not expected to survive. He was in a coma for two months and fed through a tube. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be able to breathe by himself,\u201d Irina said. \u201cThey told us that there is not much hope that he would be normal again.\u201d\n\nDoctors told the family \u201cthat part of the brain is gone,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there is nothing in the science, that they have advanced enough, that can either rebuild or replace that part, and it\u2019s permanent.\u201d\n\nThe video includes several emotional scenes.\n\nIn one, Vladdy is strapped in a chair, holding a ball.\n\n\u201cCome on, throw the ball,\u201d Irina says.\n\nVladdy drops the ball toward her.\n\n\u201cOK,\u201d Irina says. \u201cGood.\u201d\n\nBellanca was in the room, watching the scene, and he recorded his thoughts in a note dated July 8, 1997.\n\n\u201cEight weeks ago, he lifted the Stanley Cup above his head,\u201d Bellanca wrote. \u201cToday, he struggled to lift his chin above his shoulders. Yet there is hope. I saw it as he struggled to answer the command to throw the little rubber ball. There was determination, but the glint was gone from his eye. Eight weeks ago, we watched for the next crunching check. Today, strapped to a wheelchair sitting in the evening sun, we cheered when he tried to place a baseball cap on his own head.\u201d\n\nAt that time, Vladdy was still being fed through a tube. \u201cHe had some ice cream, just a tablespoon or two,\u201d Bellanca wrote. \u201cMaybe, in a week or month, he will be able to eat baby food. Maybe, in a month or maybe a year, he will walk or stand.\u201d\n\nEventually, the video documents progress. Three years after the accident, Vladdy broke into a giant smile while putting together a puzzle, the kind a child might stick together on the kitchen table.\n\n\u201cI came to the realization that he is never going to be able to gain all of his abilities back from the very beginning,\u201d Irina said.\n\nThere is another video clip of Vladdy holding a hockey stick while sitting on the driveway with his daughter, Anastasia.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know much about the nature of this injury,\u201d Irina said. \u201cShe had to learn about it, asking questions. She would ask the nurses and doctors.\u201d\n\nAnastasia was 8 when the accident happened on June 13, 1997.\n\n\u201cWhat was lost is, the very feeling of the family,\u201d Irina said. \u201cBecause my daughter lost a father, as the man can be in the father\u2019s position. She found herself having another sibling, who is not even having as much of understanding of the world and surroundings as her, probably less. Somebody who would be (like) a 2- or 3-years-old child. And development of the brain would be somewhere on that level. She had to realize and accept it and cope with it. So it makes me sad.\u201d\n\nIrina's eyes filled with tears as she spoke. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think really angry,\" she said. \"I don\u2019t know who I should be angry at, or what. For myself, do I feel pity for myself? No. Because it\u2019s not me who lost all of the feelings and not being able to walk. I\u2019m still here. Healthy. It really makes me sad for him.\u201d\n\nWhen the video ends, Bellanca sits in his chair, smiling through tears.\n\nI mention how heartbreaking it was to see Vladdy get excited putting together a child\u2019s puzzle.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not much better than that,\u201d Bellanca says.\n\nVladinator, indeed\n\nIn honor of Saturday's special moment, let us take time to celebrate the Vladinator, the player he was on the ice.\n\n\u201cEverybody in the league hated to play against Vladdy,\u201d said former Red Wings center Igor Larionov, who teamed with Konstantinov as part of the famed \"Russian Five.\"\n\n\u201cHe was a really quiet guy. But he had a lot of internal strength inside of him. He was mild but vicious, hard on the ice. He was the guy who cared more about the team than himself.\u201d\n\nVladdy was just 29 when the accident happened. He was in the prime of his career and finished second in Norris Trophy voting for the NHL's top defenseman. He was poised to be great.\n\n\u201cVladdy didn\u2019t care who we faced, if we faced the top guy like a Wayne Gretzky or a grinder, he played the same against everyone,\u201d said Hockey Hall of Famer Nicklas Lidstrom, a former Red Wing. \u201cHe tried to play physical and very aggressive and finish checks. He was very tough to play against. Vladdy had a lot of skill, maybe more skill than he showed sometimes. He wasn\u2019t the biggest guy out there, but he played like the biggest guy.\u201d\n\nMany believe the Wings would have extended their success had it not been for the accident. \u201cThe team would have won two or three more Cups in a row, because he was a very important part of that team,\" Larionov said. \"Missing a guy like that was a huge loss, the way he played, the way he made the defense. We could score some goals.\"\n\nVladimir Konstantinov and Viacheslav Fetisov on the ice after winning the Stanley Cup in Washington, D.C. Tuesday, June 16, 1998. (Photo: Julian H. Gonzalez, Special to t)\n\nThe Wings won the Cup again the next season and Vladdy was on the ice, celebrating with his friends. In one of the most iconic scenes in Wings history, captain Steve Yzerman placed the Cup in Konstantinov's lap after the Red Wings swept the Capitals in four games.\n\n\u201cHis locker was still there,\u201d Lidstrom said. \u201cHis gear was hanging next to my locker. You got a reminder every day that Vladdy was still a part of the team, even though he wasn\u2019t playing. I think that gave us motivation to have a strong season. You were always reminded of what happened.\u201d\n\nVladdy is still seen around Detroit, going to Red Wings games. He attended a showing of \"The Russian Five\" at the Detroit Free Press Film Festival in 2018, sitting a few seats from Keith Gave, a former Free Press reporter, who wrote a book about the Russian quintet and was a writer/producer of the movie.\n\n\"He was locked in to that film as he was watching it,\" Gave said. \"The problem is, he can\u2019t remember five minutes ago. He\u2019s got no short-term memory. But I truly believe he remembers who he is, what he was. His place in that dressing room with those players. I firmly believe that.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to him would have killed most of us. It speaks to how strong that man was, in his heart and in his head.\u201d\n\n'Still getting 24-hour care'\n\nIn many ways, Konstantinov is lucky this accident happened in Michigan. He has received tremendous care because of Michigan\u2019s no-fault auto insurance law.\n\n\u201cHe has gotten superb care,\" Bellanca said. \"It\u2019s improved his life.\u201d\n\nWhile Irina and Anastasia now live in Florida, Vladdy stayed in Michigan because the state's system is so fantastic.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons that Irina is not here and Vladdy is, is when she intended to move him, because she thought it would be better for him, she found out that none of the other states would provide him with the level of care that we have available to use here in Michigan,\" Bellanca said. \"That was the deciding factor. She had already sold the house and moved. She found out she couldn\u2019t replicate what we have in Michigan because they don\u2019t have the infrastructure to do it.\u201d\n\nFormer Detroit Red Wing Vladimir Konstantinov arrives before the start of the world premiere of \"The Russian Five\" during the opening night for the Freep Film Festival at The Fillmore in downtown Detroit on Wednesday, April 11, 2018. (Photo: Ryan Garza, Detroit Free Press)\n\nRecently, there have been changes to Michigan's no-fault insurance system.\n\nHe is still getting 24-hour care, but there is some concern the changes will affect Vladdy in the future.\n\n\"We don\u2019t know whether there will be an adverse effect on him and we are concerned,\" Bellanca said.\n\n\"It would be devastating to Vladdy.\"\n\nAnastasia has started a GoFundMe account called \u201cThe Vladimir Konstantinov Special Needs Trust\" to raise money for items not covered by insurance.\n\nScott Zubrickas, who owns a T-shirt company in Grand Rapids, Michigan, noticed the GoFundMe campaign and decided to help. He is selling \"Vladinator\" T-shirts through his company, The Mitten State. The shirts will be sold at Little Caesars Arena and through his website ($24.99 presale) and $5 from every sale will go to Vladdy\u2019s trust.\n\nGoFundMe: Here's how to donate to The Vladimir Konstantinov Special Needs Trust\n\nVLADINATOR T-SHIRT: Here's how to order yours today\n\n\u201cVladdy was always that guy you watched when he was on the ice to see who he was going to nail,\u201d Zubrickas said. \u201cI was really excited the family green-lit us on this one. We're hoping to help them out.\u201d\n\nThat is how we will remember Vladdy. As the Vladinator. Tough. Physical. Looking for somebody to nail.\n\nSo on this weekend, we celebrate the way Konstantinov played the game and the strength he has shown since the accident.\n\nAnd we do it with a smile, dipping into those memories, full of admiration, while wiping away tears.\n\nContact Jeff Seidel: jseidel@freepress.com.
