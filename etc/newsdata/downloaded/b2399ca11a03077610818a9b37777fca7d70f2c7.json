As students feared for their job prospects, they -- and their parents -- wanted a degree that would lead to a steady paycheck after graduation. And the perception is STEM is the path to employment. Majors in computer science and health fields have nearly doubled from 2009 to 2017. Engineering and math have also seen big jumps.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut as humanities majors slump to the lowest level in decades, calls are coming from surprising places for a revival. Some prominent economists are making the case for why it still makes a lot of sense to major (or at least take classes) in humanities alongside more technical fields.\n\nNobel Prize winner Robert Shiller has a new book out called \u201cNarrative Economics\u201d that opens with him reminiscing about how great a history class he took as an undergraduate at the University of Michigan was. He even says what he learned in history about the Great Depression was far more useful to understand that period of economic and financial turmoil than anything he learned in his economic courses.\n\nThe whole premise of Shiller\u2019s book is that stories matter. What people tell each other can have profound implications on markets -- and the overall economy. Examples include the \u201cget rich quick\u201d stories about bitcoin or the \u201canyone can be a homeowner\" stories that helped drive the housing bubble.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"Traditional economic approaches fail to examine the role of public beliefs in major economic events -- that is, narrative,' Shiller writes in the book. \u201cEconomists can best advance their science by developing and incorporating into it the art of narrative economics.\u201d\n\nShiller, who is famous for predicting the dot-com crash and coming up with the Case-Shiller Home Price Index, is now spending a lot of time looking at old newspaper clippings to understand what stories and terms went viral and how they influenced people to buy things -- or stop buying.\n\nWhen asked if he\u2019s essentially arguing for more English and history majors, Shiller said, \u201cI think so,\u201d and added, \u201ccompartmentalization of intellectual life is bad.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShiller isn\u2019t alone in wishing that there were more storytellers (and story analyzers) around. Every August, some of the world\u2019s top economists gather in Jackson Hole, Wyo., to discuss how the economy is doing and how they should tweak their models. On the final day of events, Philip Lowe, head of the Australian central bank, urged his colleagues to spend a little less time on numbers and more time on being good storytellers.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important we don\u2019t just talk about numbers, coefficients and rules, but stories that people can understand,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cStories about how policies are contributing to economic welfare and the things that really matter to people.\u201d\n\nLowe\u2019s words struck a nerve, partly because Australia has not had a recession in more than 25 years and partly because central bankers around the room generally agreed that their communication could be better.\n\nAD\n\nOne economist even pointed out that the Jamaican central bank is now employing reggae artists to explain about how \u201chigh inflation is a wicked ting.\u201d The Federal Reserve doesn\u2019t have anything quite like that, but it is currently searching for a new senior speechwriter who can help top central bank officials speak \u201cto a wide variety of audiences.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am expected to be, and I am a storyteller. I tell stories about the future,\u201d said Stefan Ingves, governor of the Swedish central bank. \u201cWe human beings simply love stories about the future. That\u2019s part of my job.\u201d\n\nIngves reminded his colleagues that they have a big platform to talk to business leaders and the public at large about the economy. If they tell a convincing story that growth will continue, people are likely to say, \u201chmmm, that\u2019s reasonable,\u201d and that could help keep confidence high so company presidents keep hiring and consumers keep spending. As the global economy slows to its lowest rate in a decade, worries are high about how much longer the economy can power on.\n\nIn many ways, President Trump\u2019s constant attempts to call this the greatest economy of all time are an effort to tell a positive story to encourage Americans to keep spending, Shiller said, even if his claim is not based in fact.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut perhaps the most powerful argument for why students (and their parents) might want to think twice about abandoning humanities is from the data. The National Center for Education Statistics also keeps track of pay and unemployment rates by major.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that the typical computer science major makes more money shortly after graduation than the typical English major. But contrary to popular belief, English majors ages 25 to 29 had a lower unemployment rate in 2017 than math and computer science majors.\n\nThat early STEM pay premium also fades quickly, according to research by David J. Deming and Kadeem L. Noray from Harvard. After about a decade, STEM majors start exiting STEM job fields as their skills are no longer the latest and greatest. In contrast, many humanities majors eventually work their way up to high-earning management positions, meaning that by middle age, average pay looks very similar across many majors.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBy age 40, the earnings of people who majored in fields like social science or history have caught up,\u201d wrote David Deming in a recent New York Times op-ed.\n\nIn management and leadership positions, communication is key, as leading economists and central bankers have been quick to point out at this critical juncture for the world economy.\n\nRelated:\n\nAD", "description": "English majors are down 25.5 percent since the Great Recession, just as world\u2019s top economists say we need more \u2018storytellers.\u2019", "authors": ["Heather Long", "Economics Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4G4EeBzuj9HT6NA7K1qsnEm_Y8Q=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QTKGOVQ7HEI6TJ2ZFOCUDO56EA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
