If the tooth had broken, she would have been in extreme pain.\n\n'Luckily the team of international specialists in dental medicine were able to produce the gold crown including Danish vet dentist Jens Ruhnau and Dr Johanna Painer from Vienna Veterinary University.'\n\nShe added: 'The operation did not have any complications and the crown fit perfectly from the start, we are happy Cara can bite properly again.'\n\nCara was found in the private ownership at a farmhouse in Mugnano, Italy in 2013 and was confiscated by authorities before she was transferred to the Tierart tiger station in Massweiler, Germany in 2015.", "description": "Cara, a five-year-old, 125lb Bengal tiger, was fitted with a golden crown to cover her damaged fang at a rescue centre in Massweiler, western Germany, earlier this month.", "authors": ["Chris Pleasance For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/11/20321530-0-image-a-32_1572347760409.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
