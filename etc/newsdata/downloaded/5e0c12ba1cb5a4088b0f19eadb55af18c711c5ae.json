I was in a committed relationship for almost All my teens and early 20s; with the exception of a few breaks, which usually in those times I was working my a** off with not much R&R... and \"meeting/trusting\" people in my position is really tuff.'\n\n'Don't f***ing pity me, not what I'm asking for,' Miley concluded. 'I have a great life I wouldn't trade for \"privacy\" but PLEASE don't make this awkward for me! I am trying to make light and like always MAKE FUN of myself/and the public's perception of me!
