Bush Friendship", "language": "en", "text": "Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres has defended sitting next to former President George W. Bush at a Dallas Cowboys game on Sunday in a video released Monday night ahead of Tuesday\u2019s broadcast.\n\nDeGeneres faced criticism on Twitter after cameras showed her laughing next to the former Republican President during Sunday\u2019s broadcast of the game. Some argued it was hypocritical for DeGeneres, an out gay women who has supported liberal causes, to socialize with the former Republican President whose record includes the Iraq War and opposition to gay marriage.\n\nDegeneres disagrees. \u201cI\u2019m friends with George Bush,\u201d she said in the video posted Monday night. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m friends with a lot of people who don\u2019t share the same beliefs that I have. We\u2019re all different and I think that we\u2019ve forgotten that that\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nDeGeneres came out as gay in 1997 and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2017 from then-President Barack Obama for pioneering LGBTQ representation. As President, former President Bush opposed gay marriage and endorsed a constitutional amendment explicitly banning gay marriage while running for reelection in 2004 \u2014 although he endorsed civil unions.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

They sat in Jones\u2019s box, and DeGeneres ended up seated next to former President Bush.\n\n\u201cDuring the game they showed a shot of George and me laughing together and so people were upset,\u201d she said. \u201cThey thought why is a gay Hollywood liberal sitting next to a conservative Republican president?\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of people were mad, and they did what people do when they\u2019re mad, they tweet,\u201d she continued. DeGeneres then showed a tweet she said she loved: \u201cEllen and George Bush together makes me have faith in America again.\u201d The audience cheered; \u201cexactly,\u201d DeGeneres said.\n\n\u201cJust because I don\u2019t agree with someone on everything doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not going to be friends with them,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I say be kind to one and other I don\u2019t mean only the people that think the same way that you do, I mean be kind to everyone.\u201d\n\nDeGeneres thanked Charlotte and Jerry Jones for hosting them and \u201cPresident Bush and Laura for a Sunday afternoon that was so fun.\u201d\n\nSunday wasn\u2019t the first time DeGenres and Bush have appeared together. He was a guest on her talk show in 2017.\n\nEllen has long said she\u2019s not a political comedian and that she tries to keep politics out of her show. However she has spoken up against anti-LGBTQ laws in the past. In 2016, for example, she spoke out against a religious-freedom law in Louisiana that would allow for discrimination based on sexual orientation. In 2019, she supported a boycott of hotels owned by the Sultan of Brunei after the country announced it would issue the death penalty on those convicted for having gay sex.\n\nDeGeneres has also spoke out against President Donald Trump, and told Matt Lauer in 2017 that she would never have the President on her show. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not going to change his mind,\u201d DeGeneres said. \u201cHe\u2019s against everything that I stand for.\u201d In her video posted on Monday, DeGeneres also made a subtle jab at the President, joking that she celebrated every time \u201canother whistleblower came forward,\u201d adding that she meant the referees at the Cowboys game.\n\nDeGeneres has also faced criticism for defending comedian Kevin Hart, who stepped down from hosting the 2019 Oscars after old anti-gay tweets of his surfaced. \u201d \u201cI believe in forgiveness. I believe in second chances. And I believe in @KevinHart4real,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nWrite to Madeleine Carlisle at madeleine.carlisle@time.com.", "description": "DeGeneres has defended sitting next to former President George W.
