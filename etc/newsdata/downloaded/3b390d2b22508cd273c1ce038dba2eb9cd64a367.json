Both have blamed \"flight shame\".\n\nCompanies such as Klarna Bank AB are cutting back on business flights. The Swedish bank has banned all employee air travel within Europe and discourages long-haul flights.\n\nThe anti-flying movement - which emerged in 2017 after singer Staffan Lindberg pledged to give up flying - has now spread well beyond its native Sweden.\n\nGermany has announced plans to cut taxes for train journeys and boost fees for flights. And as world leaders met in New York City for the UN Climate Action Summit last month, delegates were quick to quiz each other on how they travelled as \"flight shame\" reached peak attention.\n\n\"If there's an elephant in the room ... of course it's aviation,\" Norway's Minister of Climate and Environment Ola Elvestuen told the summit.", "description": "Born in Sweden, the movement to discourage taking planes for environmental reasons has spread to travelers far and wide.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/2/1169d9aaf8b245c3a0c2ad4ee84b23c1_18.jpg"}
