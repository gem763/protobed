In the course of that conversation, he referenced conversations with Mayor Giuliani.\n\n'He was clearly receiving other information from other sources, including Mayor Giuliani, that was more negative, causing him to retain this negative view of a corrupt Ukraine.'\n\nTwo months later the Office of Management and Budget said it would look into whether Ukraine should get the $400 million set aside by congress.\n\nIf they can satisfy Rudy, they can satisfy the President Source familiar with the May 23 meeting\n\nAn Energy Department spokesperson confirmed Perry had spoken with Giuliani.\n\nWhen asked of chats with Perry, Giuliani told CNN: 'Did Henry Kissinger ever call me about Ukraine. What about Colin Powell.'\n\nThe claims appear to show how important private citizen Giuliani was in getting access to the president in matters involving Ukraine.\n\nThe whistleblower who prompted the impeachment probe has already has already alleged that the former mayor of New York strayed away from policy advised by US diplomats when speaking on Ukraine.\n\nAnd the Associated Press reported Monday that a circle of businessmen and Republican donors touted their connections to Trump and Giuliani as they sought to install new management at the top of Ukraine's state-owned gas company last spring.\n\nNancy Pelosi formally launched the impeachment inquiry last month after Trump's call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\n\nNancy Pelosi formally launched the impeachment inquiry last month after revelations Trump pressured Ukraine's president in a July 25 phone call to investigate 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nIt was reported Tuesday Giuliani will not cooperate with the U.S. House of Representatives impeachment investigation.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsay Graham, a fellow Republican, said on Tuesday he would invite Giuliani to testify before his committee. The Washington Post reported that he is 'very interested' in accepting the offer but that there were a lot of legal issues to consider.\n\nHouse Democrats have already subpoenaed Sondland after he failed to show up at a scheduled deposition Tuesday morning.\n\nThree House committees are demanding that Sondland appear at a deposition October 16. They are also demanding that he produce documents, including communications from his personal device that have been turned over to the State Department but not to Congress.\n\nSondland, a major donor to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, was one of a handful of US diplomats on a text message chain between July and September that goes to the heart of the investigation.\n\nThe messages involving Giuliani show them coordinating to pressure Kiev into investigating Biden, as Ukraine sought US military aid and access.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff said investigators have learned that Sondland has text messages or emails on a personal device that are 'deeply relevant' to the probe, but that State is withholding them.\n\nRick Perry, the US Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, left, and the State Department's special representative to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, right are all said to have met with Trump on May 23\n\nTrump tweeted Tuesday morning that he would 'love' to send Sondland, but that the Democrats proceedings are 'totally compromised.' The White House says the administration will not cooperate with the impeachment inquiry, calling it 'illegitimate.'\n\nDemocrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee are welcoming an invitation for Giuliani to testify about corruption in Ukraine.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the panel's senior Democrat, said she wants to question Giuliani under oath about his role in seeking the Ukrainian government's assistance to investigate one of the president's political rivals.\n\nShe said Democrats 'have plenty of questions for Mr. Giuliani and this would give us an opportunity to help separate fact from fiction for the American people.'\n\nFellow California Sen. Kamala Harris, a committee member and presidential candidate, tweeted to Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham: 'Good. I have questions.'\n\nGraham, a Trump ally, said he wants testimony about the firing of a former Ukrainian prosecutor widely seen as corrupt.", "description": "The president, main, is said to have asked the trio including Perry, top inset, to deal with Giuliani, bottom inset, in a May 23 meeting.", "authors": ["Lauren Fruen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/03/19471640-0-image-a-25_1570588425973.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
