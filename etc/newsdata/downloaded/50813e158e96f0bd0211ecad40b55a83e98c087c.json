Goldman Sachs surveyed 1,800 of its global interns and found some surprising results about their views on life. The survey asked various questions including what interns thought would cause the biggest global impact in 10 years as well as whether they preferred hotels or Airbnb rentals. Goldman Sachs highlighted some key takeaways: 85% favored the legalization of cannabis for medical use and 48% globally favored legalization for recreational use, while 72% of the interns favored a second Brexit referendum. Only 4% said influencers helped when making buying decisions. To be sure, the selection process for the bank's internship is considered to be among the most rigorous in the finance world - this particular crop of Gen Z-ers is thus likely to be more educated, performance-driven and competitive than the average in that generation. Below are the findings Goldman found out about its interns.\n\nWho they are Goldman Sachs Goldman Sach's 1,800 interns came from far and wide. More than 400 universities, 46 languages, and 61 areas of study were represented. More women than men were taking up the trainee roles at the bank.\n\nBrands over product Goldman Sachs When it came to buying products, the interns valued brand over product. Forty-one percent said the brand was the most important, while 26% said the product was. Interestingly, only 4% said influencers helped when making decisions.\n\nHotels over Airbnb Goldman Sachs When it came to travel, interns preferred to stay in hotels, with two-thirds favoring them. Airbnb rentals, on the other hand, were much more unfashionable. Just 29% said they preferred homestays.\n\nWhen it came to feeling like themselves, water bottles and sleep were important Goldman Sachs Sleep was the most important factor, with over a third wanting eight hours a night. Eighteen percent said they needed caffeine and 14% said a water bottle was vital.\n\nWhen it came to careers, employer size didn't matter as much as the work itself Goldman Sachs What mattered most was the actual job the interns did and working with the right people. Employer size didn't seem to matter as much, nor did wearing what they wanted.\n\nWork-life balance Goldman Sachs When it came to work-life balance friends and family came out on top with nearly two-thirds wanting to spend time with loved ones. Being able to stop thinking about work came in the next highest. (Oddly, 1% of the interns said work-life balance meant sitting on a beanbag?)\n\nOnly a third said they thought the American economy would get better Goldman Sachs Confidence in the economy wasn't at the forefront of the interns' thinking. Outside the Americas, 55% were bullish about improvements, but the same couldn't be said for the American interns.\n\nFavoring legal drug use was more common Goldman Sachs Eighty-five percent of the interns favored legalization of pot for medical use, while nearly half wanted it to be legal for recreational use.\n\nMost wanted government action on climate change Goldman Sachs Perhaps the most strongly felt opinion across the board was that the interns wanted action on climate change. Eighty-three percent wanted a carbon tax to help fight it.\n\nBrexit doesn't mean Brexit Goldman Sachs When it came to Brexit, the interns were much more in favor of a second referendum, though which way they voted wasn't clear. The interns in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa were slightly more in favor - over three-quarters.\n\nAI will be the biggest influence Goldman Sachs The bank's interns felt that the biggest change in the future would be the use of artificial intelligence. Thirty-one percent did say climate change, 9% said resource scarcity, and 6% said cybercrime.", "description": "Goldman Sachs surveyed 1,800 of its interns across the    world to see what mattered most to them in life and their    thoughts on everything from Brexit to...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://markets.businessinsider.com/apple-touch-icon.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
