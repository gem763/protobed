With some exasperation, she said: \u201cEveryone we\u2019ve seen from Thomas Cook have blamed everybody apart from themselves.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s the volcanic ash, it\u2019s the hot weather in the UK, it\u2019s the depreciation of sterling, it\u2019s the debts acquired to someone else.\n\n\u201cIt would be really, really good for someone from Thomas Cook to say to your customers and your suppliers and your employees, some of whom are sitting here today: \u2018We got it wrong. And I wish I could go back and do something different. I wish we had disposed of some assets. I wish we hadn\u2019t bought MyTravel. I wish we had made different decisions\u2019 \u2013 rather than just passing the buck to someone else.\u201d\n\nThe former executives were asked to explain what they had got wrong.\n\nMs Green told the committee: \u201cWe started with some of these amazing Apple-type stores with lots of technology where people would queue in Lakeside [an Essex retail park] to make sure, with their augmented reality, that they could actually see the hotel where they would be staying in.\n\n\u201cI should have pushed that even harder and faster.\u201d\n\nMr Scott said: \u201cWe should have gone more quickly, we should have got out of a cycle of restructuring, plan after plan after plan that we couldn\u2019t get to the bottom of, we should have become a bit more digital, a bit more able to compete in the current landscape.\n\n\u201cIt just wasn\u2019t quick enough.\u201d\n\nTowards the the end of the session, Mr Fontenla-Novoa made an emotional statement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly sad the company has failed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a company I worked with since I was 18, and worked my way up to became CEO.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a company I care deeply about.\n\n\u201cDo I regret things? Of course I regret things. I\u2019m human, I made mistakes.\u201d\n\nEarlier, MPs questioned Dean Beale, chief executive of the Insolvency Service. He revealed that Hays Travel paid only \u00a36m to acquire 555 Thomas Cook travel agencies \u2013 a cost per store just over \u00a310,000 each.\n\nMr Beale said: \u201cThe assessment of the Official Receiver was that this was a good deal for creditors.\u201d\n\nHe also said that paying \u201cspecial managers\u201d to help sort out the company\u2019s affairs had cost \u00a311m in the first three week of the liquidation.\n\nThere have been claims that Thomas Cook Airlines was profitable and should have been preserved as a going concern. But Mr Beale said that the airline had been deemed to be insolvent.", "description": "A month after the collapse of Thomas Cook, two former chief executives and a former finance chief of the travel firm\u00a0have been berated by members of the Business Select Committee.
