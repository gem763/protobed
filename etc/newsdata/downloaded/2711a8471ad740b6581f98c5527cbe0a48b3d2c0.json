I\u2019ve written before about the best way to find your next Chef\u2019s knife and why a chef\u2019s knife and a paring are really the only two essential knives in your kitchen. Since then, I\u2019ve used several Santoku knives and have come to love their lightweight, versatile nature. So now I\u2019m here to say that if you don\u2019t need ten inches of blade and seven inches or less is enough for you, you might want to give some serious thought to this sharp upgrade. And to help, I\u2019ve put together some of the top-rated Santoku knives you can find on Amazon.\n\nVictorinox 7-Inch Fibrox Pro Santoku Knife, $45 on Amazon: Victorinox, maker of the Swiss Army Knife, knows how to do knives and has an extensive line of kitchen cutlery. And in the Fibrox Santoku they\u2019ve really instilled an extremely lightweight take on the everyday knife that slices things with ease and has become my partner\u2019s favorite. It\u2019s got a 4.6-star average rating from more than 800 reviewers and its Granton edge is designed to keep food from sticking to it (and actually does). The non-slip grip will stay firmly in your grasp even if it\u2019s covered in water.\n\nPAUDIN Classic 7-Inch Hollow Ground Santoku Knife, $34 on Amazon: The most affordable option on this list is made from German high carbon stainless steel and resists rust (though you should still dry it after washing it). Fifty reviewers leave it a 4.6-star average rating. The pakkawood handle is designed for comfortable handling and its styled pattern gives you an aesthetic to match your own and elevate your kitchen a bit.\n\nGrand Ma\u00eetre 7-Inch Santoku Knife, $130 on Amazon: More significant in weight than the Fibrox, the rosewood handle and forged steel design of this Santoku really appealed to me. I find it much lighter than a chef\u2019s knife and so objectively still felt like I was barely holding anything. And yet, its fluted edge and study build left me feeling more confident as I cut. Not to mention, this knife is gorgeous and a lot of fun to hold through an hour or so of workday evening cooking.\n\nDALSTRONG Shogun Series 7-Inch Santoku Knife, $118 on Amazon: DALSTRONG gets real serious about its cutlery and that\u2019s certainly true for this Santoku knife, the top-selling Santoku on Amazon. The super hard Japanese steel is comprised of 67 layers of high carbon stainless steel and the forged build means extra precision in your hand. With a 4.5-star average rating from more than 550 reviewers, your cutting board will find itself in good company.\n\nSasaki Takumi 7-Inch Santoku Knife with Locking Sheath, $99 on Amazon: I\u2019m a huge fan of Sasaki\u2019s paring knife so can only presume its Santoku knife is likewise a great choice. Helping me is a 4.6-star average rating from nearly 100 reviewers. Sixty-seven layers of Japanese AUS-10 Stainless Steel makes up the blade and Sasaki added into the steel molybdenum and vanadium to help resist wear and maintain a sharp edge. Further assisting in that department is a sheath specifically built for the Santoku that\u2019s included.\n\nShun Cutlery\u2019s Classic 5.5-Inch Santoku Kitchen Knife, $108 on Amazon: It would be hard to talk Santoku without mentioning Shun. But they\u2019re also giving us a second reason to ramble about them: They\u2019re offering a highly-rated blade that\u2019s 5.5 inches long rather than seven. And that tempts me even further. After all, I rarely need lots of length when I\u2019m cooking at home. Even when I spread out a bunch of parsley or kale, I\u2019m usually pushing it together to help me chop it up. Shun makes it own steel with chromium to enhance its durability and resist corrosion and wear. And besides that, the brand itself is a classic choice for knives.\n\nWusthof 5-Inch Santoku Knife, $60 on Amazon: Another classic cutlery brand, Wusthof brings us a top-rated Santoku that\u2019s even shorter. The 5-inch blade here is forged and triple riveted for extra precise handling. More than 150 reviewers left it with a 4.8-star average rating, a fairly uncommon average. Dishwasher-safe and also boasting high carbon stainless steel, you\u2019ve got a really charming and low-profile knife for lightweight use however you need it.\n\nNEWSLETTERS The Scouted Newsletter Product recommendations that'll make your life better and tips to help you shop smarter.
