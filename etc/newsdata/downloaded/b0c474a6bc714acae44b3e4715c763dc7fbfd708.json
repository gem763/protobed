The networks\u2019 ratings-driving primetime lineups are jam-packed with vociferous Trump defenders, and some of Fox\u2019s biggest names\u2014such as Pete Hegseth, Sean Hannity, Lou Dobbs, Rupert Murdoch, to name just a few\u2014have long served as sounding boards, phone-a-friends, and informal advisors to the president.\n\nBut privately, President Trump had been raising these questions of institutional loyalty, on-and-off, since at least the middle of last year. Several people who\u2019ve heard him do this view it as more of a gutcheck than a loss of faith, and as yet another indication that Trump can interpret even the smallest deviations as a slight or a betrayal.\n\nHis suspicions were once again piqued one Sunday morning last month, shortly following the suspension of Fox host Jeanine Pirro, a Trump friend and loyalist.\n\n\u201cKeep fighting for Tucker [Carlson], and fight hard for @JudgeJeanine,\u201d the president wrote on Twitter on March 17. \u201cYour competitors are jealous - they all want what you\u2019ve got - NUMBER ONE. Don\u2019t hand it to them on a silver platter. They can\u2019t beat you, you can only beat yourselves!\u201d\n\nAt the time, Media Matters had been releasing unearthed audio clips of Carlson making various repulsive comments, such as defending statutory rape and calling Iraqis \u201csemiliterate primitive monkeys,\u201d and Pirro was briefly suspended by Fox for anti-Muslim comments regarding Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN).\n\nA few hours after he posted that tweet, however, the president was back online, lashing out at a different corner of Fox News. \u201cWere @FoxNews weekend anchors, @ArthelNeville and @LelandVittert, trained by CNN prior to their ratings collapse?\u201d he tweeted that Sunday. \u201cIn any event, that\u2019s where they should be working, along with their lowest rated anchor, Shepard Smith!\u201d\n\nIt was around the time of this tweet that the president began telling those close to him to monitor the channel, to \u201ckeep an eye\u201d out for hints of dissension in the ranks, and to report back to him on anything troubling. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on this story.\n\nTo those who\u2019ve worked for Trump, such behavior isn\u2019t all that surprising.\n\nDuring the early days of his 2016 presidential run, recalled Sam Nunberg, a former political adviser to Trump who worked on the beginning of the campaign, Trump privately and repeatedly complained about several Fox personalities he believed had crossed him, including Dana Perino, former host Megyn Kelly (even before their public tiff started by her questions during a Republican primary debate), and Fox Business Network star Neil Cavuto.\n\nHe felt especially aggrieved and kept mental note of the Fox on-air talent he felt had been dismissive of his run for office. Trump would often use the same five words when expressing his disappointment to a host from the otherwise friendly network: \u201c I\u2019m very surprised by you .\u201d\n\nNunberg recounted being in the future president\u2019s Trump Tower office in May 2015\u2014a month before the campaign\u2019s launch\u2014while Trump was on the phone for an interview with Cavuto. By the conclusion of their on-air chat, the businessman-turned-politician felt Cavuto wasn\u2019t taking his presidential ambitions seriously and spent too much time badgering him about his finances. This was, to Nunberg\u2019s recollection, the \u201cstart of Trump despising Neil.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump hung up the phone, he looked up at his aides assembled in his office and said, \u201cWhat the hell was that? We\u2019re not doing him again,\u201d according to Trump\u2019s former adviser. \u201cYeah, why was he being such an asshole?\u201d Nunberg recalled replying to his boss at the time.\n\nOf course, the president couldn\u2019t fully enforce that grudge, as Cavuto co-hosted the Fox Business Network\u2019s Nov. 2015 Republican primary debate. And Trump even sat down for a cordial one-on-one with Cavuto immediately following that event, during which the future president complimented Cavuto, saying, \u201cYou did a really elegant job\u201d and \u201cgreat job.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was [on the campaign], part of our strategy was to go around Fox News,\u201d Nunberg told The Daily Beast on Wednesday. \u201cThe president wanted to get all the coverage he could possibly get and saturate media\u2026 That was something I talked to Trump about early on in the campaign. The president decided that we weren\u2019t going to run in the Fox News primary or by their rules.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWe didn\u2019t think Fox News was out to get him, but we didn\u2019t think they were going to prefer Donald Trump to be the nominee at that point, especially when you had people like Karl Rove and Dana Perino on the station. Eventually, Fox News was going to have to make a business and political decision to come around to him. That was something that the president discussed with me [during the primary].\u201d\n\nBut in the years since, and even after becoming president, Trump has not stopped keeping tabs on who at Fox is, or isn\u2019t, remaining faithful to him and his cause. This week, Trump kicked up some more dust, seemingly referring to himself and Fox News as \u201cwe.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo weird to watch Crazy Bernie on @FoxNews. Not surprisingly, @BretBaier and the \u2018audience\u2019 was so smiley and nice. Very strange, and now we have @donnabrazile?\u201d the president tweeted on Tuesday, the morning after 2020 Democratic presidential contender and democratic socialist Bernie Sanders appeared at a Fox-hosted town hall event.\n\nBy Tuesday evening, the subject still clearly bothered Trump.\n\n\u201cMany Trump Fans & Signs were outside of the @FoxNews Studio last night in the now thriving (Thank you President Trump) Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, for the interview with Crazy Bernie Sanders,\u201d the president posted to Twitter, making a baseless claim about his \u201cFans\u201d being shut out. \u201cBig complaints about not being let in-stuffed with Bernie supporters.\u201d\n\nTrump concluded his tweet with a rhetorical question: \u201cWhat\u2019s with @FoxNews?\u201d", "description": "Even before publicly freaking out about Bernie Sanders\u2019 town hall, the president has long kept tabs on whether the network was going wobbly on him.", "authors": ["Asawin Suebsaeng", "Andrew Kirell", "White House Reporter", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1555534955/190416-Swin-Trump-biden-fox-tease_oi2to3", "published_at": "2019-04-17"}
