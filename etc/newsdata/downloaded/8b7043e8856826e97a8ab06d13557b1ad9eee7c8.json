I am thinking of the police here and around France. Everyone is shocked and profoundly hurt by what has happened here.\u201d\n\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, both visited the scene.

After I saw three police officers crying and other colleagues crying. At first I thought a police officer had killed himself; afterwards I learned someone had killed the officers. The officer who killed the man was crying.\u201d\n\nThe attack came a day after thousands of officers marched in Paris to protest against low wages, long hours and an increasing suicide rate in their ranks.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People are held at a security perimeter after the incident.
