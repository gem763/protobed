Or maybe less. And that\u2019s not new. It goes back decades, to Trump\u2019s years as a real estate developer and Giuliani\u2019s campaigns for mayor of New York City.\n\nNow that Trump is president, with Giuliani acting as his lawyer and shadow envoy to Ukraine to try to dig up dirt on Democratic rivals past and present\u2014an effort leading to alleged abuse of the president\u2019s office and impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives\u2014those shady connections take on a whole new significance.\n\nOne of the central figures in the Trump-Giuliani-Ukraine nexus is Sam Kislin, a businessman and philanthropist often identified with the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 community of Brighton Beach in Brooklyn\u2014and with alleged mob connections.\n\nOn Monday, the three House committees pursuing the impeachment inquiry sent a \u201crequest\u201d to Kislin for a potentially vast trove of documents and communications with Trump, Giuliani, and scores of Ukrainians.\n\nKislin and Giuliani were not immediately available for comment.\n\nMOB-SPEAK\n\nAt the heart of the current impeachment inquiry is Trump\u2019s none-too-subtle bullying of Ukraine\u2019s recently elected President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 phone call as exposed by a so-far anonymous whistleblower and partial notes on the conversation released by the White House.\n\nTrump has described the call as completely ordinary and indeed \u201cperfect\u201d\u2014which suggests the president of the United States is oblivious to his own accustomed mob-speak. Ukraine\u2019s survival against Russian aggression was at stake, Trump had withheld vital aid, and when it was mentioned by Zelensky, Trump asked for \u201ca favor\u201d\u2014the dirt he longs for on Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. The exchange reads like a geopolitical version of the old protection racket threat: \u201cNice shop you got here, too bad if something happened to it.\u201d\n\nAlthough recently published narratives in the New York Times and elsewhere about developments over the last few months name several Ukrainian businessmen as intermediaries in Giuliani\u2019s efforts to slime Clinton and Biden, for anti-corruption activists here the first local figure that leaps to mind in connection with Trump and Giuliani is 84-year-old Sam Kislin.\n\n\u201c Two years ago the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU), citing as its motive \u2018defense of economic interests,\u2019 barred Kislin from entering the country. \u201d\n\nHe has introduced himself to Ukrainian journalists as \u201cGiuliani\u2019s ex-adviser\u201d and bragged of his donations to Giuliani\u2019s mayoral campaigns in the 1990s. Kislin and Trump have been photographed together, and in the late 1990s Kislin reportedly played a small but crucial role helping Trump stave off financial disaster.\n\nKislin\u2019s alleged ties to major figures in the Russian mob have been widely written about and only partially denied\u2014an issue we will explore here at some length. He reportedly has been investigated by the FBI, but he has never been charged with any crime in the United States.\n\nTwo years ago the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU), citing as its motive \u201cdefense of economic interests,\u201d barred Kislin from entering the country, a decision reversed in the courts since Zelensky became president last May. Kislin showed up soon afterward, telling local reporters he intended to testify against former President Petro Poroshenko.\n\nCertainly if Trump or Giuliani needed a tour guide to the vast mire of Ukraine\u2019s corruption, few know more about it than Kislin, who is currently caught up in a contentious fight to recover some $23 million he claims was stolen from him by Zelensky\u2019s predecessor.\n\n\u201cI have come across such schemes! I can see everything,\u201d Kislin told investigators from the Stop Corruption website. \u201cNobody needs to tell me anything, I can read by the eyes, I can read the lips, how people behave themselves here. It is time to become civilized.\u201d\n\nLITTLE ODESSA\n\n\u201cSam\u201d Kislin was born Semyon Kislin in the Black Sea port of Odessa in 1935, but built his fortune out of the \u201cLittle Odessa\u201d neighborhood around Brooklyn\u2019s Brighton Beach. He emigrated from what was then the Soviet Union in 1972 and, according to a brief biographical sketch on his website, Kislin first went to Boston, where he \u201cfound work at various jobs to support his family, including a grocery clerk and taxi cab driver.\u201d\n\nIn 1976 Kislin moved to Brooklyn where \u201cwith the assistance of fellow Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s, Mr. Kislin established a small electronics store, where he sold goods to local residents.\u201d Many of those residents were shipping or carrying appliances back to the USSR. Kislin writes that he \u201cbegan trading goods with the former Soviet Union and, in time, became well respected in the international business community.\u201d\n\nIt was right at the beginning of his Brooklyn career that Kislin made the acquaintance of a brash young real estate developer named Donald Trump who, Kislin subsequently told Bloomberg Businessweek, bought 200 televisions on credit for one of his Hyatt hotel projects. Kislin said that Trump paid him in full after precisely 30 days. \u201cHe never gave me any trouble,\u201d Kislin said.\n\nA much more important connection came years later.\n\nIn 1992, according to his website biography, Kislin \u201cestablished Trans Commodities, Inc., which he ultimately developed into one of the world\u2019s premiere commodities trading firms.\u201d\n\n\u201c Look, back in the day it was impossible not to be connected to criminals. \u201d \u2014 Leonid Nor, Odessan diaspora office in Brighton Beach\n\nRemember, in 1992 the Soviet Union had just collapsed and many billionaires were created almost overnight by looting the resources of the defunct communist empire. The lines between shrewd business dealings and organized crime were difficult to draw, including in Little Odessa.\n\n\u201cLook, back in the day it was impossible not to be connected to criminals,\u201d Leonid Nor, vice president of the Odessan diaspora office in Brighton Beach, told The Daily Beast earlier this month.\n\nIn at least one instance, Kislin helped newly minted billionaires from the defunct USSR find useful places to put their money. Not in commodities but in luxury apartments.\n\nReal estate was a favorite safe haven for fugitive Russian monies since they could convert mountains of cash into opulent residential addresses with few reporting requirements.\n\nNobody understood that better than Donald Trump, who had been cultivating Russian and other ex-Soviet clients from the beginning. But in 1998 he was struggling to survive. His casino and resort operations in Atlantic City were in deep trouble, and to recover he had to launch an enormous construction project\u2014what would be at the time the world\u2019s tallest all-residential building: Trump World Tower opposite the United Nations in New York. It was a huge gamble. Trump was under a mountain of debt to German banks. But the apartments were especially attractive to oligarchs who had just seen the ruble collapse and were rushing to get even more of their money out of Russia.\n\nThat\u2019s where Kislin stepped in. As Bloomberg Businessweek reported, he offered his former Soviet compatriots personal mortgages, which presumably allowed them the time to move their money and, if they chose actually to be in New York, to live in over-the-top Trumpian luxury.\n\nThe 1990s also saw the flowering of Kislin\u2019s relationship with Rudy Giuliani. As a matter of public record, when Giuliani ran for mayor in 1993 and then for reelection in 1997, Kislin, his family and companies contributed $46,250 to Giuliani\u2019s campaign and organized fund raisers that garnered much more. Giuliani then appointed Kislin to the mayor\u2019s Council of Economic Advisors, a position that Kislin still brags about.\n\nMOB ALLEGATIONS\n\nIn 1999, as Giuliani was about to launch his campaign against Hillary Clinton for the U.S. Senate in 2000, Kislin reportedly co-chaired a fundraiser for him that racked up $2.1 million in contributions. But just then an investigation by the nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity made headlines: \u201cRudy Donor Linked To Russian Mob,\u201d bannered the New York Post . Even The Moscow Times ran the Associated Press version of the story.\n\nThe Center for Public Integrity report noted that Kislin acknowledged \u201ca business history with a reputed Soviet Bloc crime figure and a notorious arms dealer.\u201d It cited a 1996 Interpol report that claimed Kislin\u2019s Trans Commodities was \u201cused by two reputed mobsters from Uzbekistan, Lev and Mikhail Chernoy, for fraud and embezzlement.\u201d It stated that \u201ca confidential 1994 FBI intelligence report on the Brooklyn, N.Y,, mob organization headed by Vyacheslav Invankov, the imprisoned godfather of Russian organized crime in the United States, lists Kislin as a \u2018member/associate\u2019 of Ivankov\u2019s gang. It claims that his company co-sponsored a Russian crime boss and contract killer for a U.S. visa and asserts that he was a \u2018close associate\u2019 of the late notorious arms smuggler Babeck Seroush, who later settled in Russia.\u201d\n\nThe report said both the FBI and Interpol concluded Trans Commodities had \u201claundered millions of dollars and was used for fraudulent banking documents by the Chernoys in the early 1990s as the brothers engineered the takeover of much of Russia\u2019s metals industry, notably aluminum, through alleged embezzlement, money laundering and murder.\u201d\n\n\u201c Never, never, never. \u201d \u2014 Sam Kislin, when asked about alleged money laundering\n\n(Chernoy had a long-running billion-dollar feud with Oleg Deripaska, another metals magnate once closely connected, as it happens, to former Trump campaign chairman and convicted felon Paul Manafort. Chernoy and Deripaska settled out of court in 2012 and just this year Deripaska, after U.S. sanctions against him were lifted, invested $200 million in a new aluminum plant in Kentucky, the home state of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. But that\u2019s another story.)\n\nSam Kislin\u2019s responses to the Center for Public Integrity were measured. \u201cHe acknowledged that Trans Commodities employed Mikhail Chernoy as the company\u2019s manager between 1988 and 1992, but said he knew Lev Chernoy only in passing. \u2018Mikhail Chernoy is the best man I ever knew,\u2019 he said.\u201d\n\nKislin said he didn\u2019t know mob boss Ivankov. But, yes, he had done business with Seroush. That visa for a hit man? Someone had forged Kislin\u2019s signature. And money laundering? \u201cNever, never, never.\u201d\n\nKislin reiterated that he has never been charged with a crime in the United States.\n\nThe most exhaustive investigation of Kislin and his family on the public record was conducted by the Massachusetts Gaming Commission in 2012 and 2013 when a company partly backed by Sam Kislin\u2019s nephew, Arik Kislin, applied for a casino license.\n\nThe commission was far from satisfied with an investigative report supplied by Arik, which the commission suggested was \u201creverse due diligence\u201d with \u201cthe intent of showing a clear record or history.\u201d That report had claimed Sam and Arik did not work together and in fact Arik did not like his uncle very much. An investigator hired by the commission concluded Arik \u201cwas heavily involved in the business activities of his uncle Semyon (Sam) Kislin and his brothers.\u201d\n\nBut even the favorable due diligence report had nuggets like this: \u201cIn 1992, [Arik] Kislin formed a company called Blonde Management. Kislin stated that the company was created for Chernoy\u2019s convenience. \u2026 Blonde Management periodically sponsored individuals for U.S. temporary work visas at Chernoy\u2019s direction. There have been media reports that Blonde Management and Trans Commodities sponsored Anton Malevsky for a visa to enter the U.S. Malevsky was reputed to be a member of a Russian organized crime group and a contract killer. [Arik] Kislin acknowledged that, at Chernoy\u2019s direction, Blonde Management submitted a work visa on Malevsky\u2019s behalf.\u201d\n\nMalevsky died in a parachuting accident in South Africa in 2001.\n\nThe company backed by Arik Kislin did not get the gaming license in Massachusetts.\n\nLAND OF THE OLIGARCHS\n\nThis background on Kislin is well known to independent corruption investigators in Ukraine.\n\nThe head of Transparency International in Kyiv, Andrii Borovyk, told The Daily Beast he is concerned about businessmen previously returning to Ukraine who previously were banned by law. \u201cKislin and his friends with dubious backgrounds helped Giuliani to get elected,\u201d Borovyk said, adding, \u201cTheir activities should be a concern for any state.\u201c\n\n\u201cWe have questions for our authorities: what was Kislin doing in the offices of high [Ukrainian] officials?\u201d Borovyk said he is \u201cvery worried\u201d that former businessmen from the orbit of deposed pro-Putin President Viktor Yanukovych\u2019s \u201cwho were previously accused of various violations here are now being permitted to come back to Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe understand who Kislin is. He is considered to be a thief from New York, very well connected to organized crime,\u201d Daria Kaleniuk, one of Ukraine\u2019s most articulate corruption fighters, told The Daily Beast.\n\nKaleniuk\u2019s watchdog organization, Ukraine\u2019s Anti-Corruption Action Center, is keeping an eye on Kislin. \u201cKislin and a few other Giuliani clients, including Ukrainian billionaire Pavel Fuks, were buying Yanukovych\u2019s toxic money; and Kislin wants his money back,\u201d Kaleniuk said. Fuks is supposed to have played a significant role in promoting the Biden conspiracy theory to Giuliani.\n\nPresident Trump repeated several times at the press conference with President Zelensky that he knew many \u201cvery good Ukrainian people.\u201d Perhaps he had in mind such men as Fuks and Kislin.\n\nCertainly Kislin feels he\u2019s got the backing of his powerful friends from New York City as he wages what sometimes sounds like a vendetta against the former head of state here. He accuses ex-President Petro Poroshenko of stealing not only his own money, but money supposed to have been part of a deal with the Trump administration. \u201cPoroshenko cheated on my president, Donald Trump,\u201d Kislin told the local press this summer. He claimed Poroshenko had promised to buy huge volumes of American coal, but did not, and in the process \u201cstole $700-$800 million.\u201d\n\nThe morass of corruption here is nothing if not complicated. Yuriy Lutsenko, the prosecutor Giuliani spoke with extensively about Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who was never accused of breaking any laws here, is the same prosecutor who seized $1.5 billion held in Cyprus banks that Lutsenko said belonged to ex-President Yanukovych's \"team,\" and Kislin now says belongs to him.\n\nBack in Brighton Beach, meanwhile, it seems Trump and Giuliani can do no wrong. , Leonid Nor, the vice president of the Odessan diaspora office, told The Daily Beast that when he\u2019s visited Sam Kislin and his wife at their home, Kislin has talked about being \u201cTrump\u2019s old friend.\u201d And that\u2019s still a badge of honor. \u201cWe in our Odessa diaspora community all voted for Giuliani and for Trump,\u201d says Nor. He says he even donated money for Trump\u2019s border wall meant to keep out unwanted immigrants.", "description": "The House wants a trove of documents and communications from Sam Kislin, who helped Trump stave off bankruptcy and helped fund Giuliani\u2019s political campaigns.", "authors": ["Anna Nemtsova", "Adam Rawnsley", "Christopher Dickey", "World News Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569902497/190927-nemtsova-kislin-tease_vxjj8e", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
