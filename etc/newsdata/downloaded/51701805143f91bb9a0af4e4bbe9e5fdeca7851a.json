But even before we stepped inside the Ryogoku Kokugikan sumo hall for the finals, it was apparent that wrestling was no longer the main game. Bizarrely, it was Donald Trump.\n\nThe US President and his wife Melania had flown in that week and like us, were heading to the sumo finals that afternoon with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife Akie.\n\nUS President Donald Trump stole the show at the sumo championship held at Ryogoku Kokugikan stadium. AP\n\nUnlike Trump, we were attending with 40 or so other tourists, who were being given a quick introduction to the sport across the road from the sumo hall. With little understanding of what to expect, we were all keen to get a run-down. How did it begin? What was the point? Did any Japanese still go?\n\nBut all our guide wanted to talk about was the US President. \"Trump will be here today!\" she exclaimed. It wasn't really why we'd come, and I cast around to see how everyone else was dealing with this revelation. Similarly blank.\n\nAt least one fan was choosing to boycott the final because Trump's appearance might hijack all things traditional Japanese.\n\n\"You're so lucky to be here on the same day as the Trump!\" she reiterated. No-one could beat the wrestler at the top of the draw, our guide explained, so a lot of the tension had gone out of the day's fixtures.\n\nThe Trump excitement seemed a little at odds with the local English-language newspapers that morning, which reported at least one fan who was choosing to boycott the final because of the increased security and the general sense that Trump's appearance might hijack all things traditional Japanese.", "description": "Even before AFR journalist Jemima Whyte arrived at the wrestling in Tokyo, it was clear a very special guest was going to be the main attraction.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3326%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/683f06de30d2f8f0da6fc306cae8da506be1570a", "published_at": "2019-06-05"}
