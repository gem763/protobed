Whitaker is a minor footnote in the sordid history of the Trump administration, an unqualified toady who served as acting attorney general for three months before a heavyweight hack\u2014Bill Barr\u2014took over. But on Tuesday, Whitaker went on Fox News with the essence of Trump\u2019s lame new defense: \u201cAbuse of power is not a crime.\u201d\n\nTrump brown-nosers have already exhausted other, more plausible excuses for the president\u2019s conduct. Ambassador William Taylor\u2019s smoking howitzer testimony obliterated the \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d defense the president and his defenders have been peddling since the Ukraine scandal broke. Taylor\u2019s careful timeline established beyond the shadow of a doubt that Trump abused his power as president. Instead of contesting that conclusion, the White House is now moving to a defense arguing that Trump\u2019s behavior might have been \u201cinappropriate\u201d or even wrong, but what he did wasn't illegal and therefore does not rise to the level of impeachment.\n\nThis will change the nature of the trial of Donald John Trump in the U.S. Senate, Chief Justice John Roberts presiding. Instead of arguing the facts, the president\u2019s lawyers and Senate defenders will more likely take a page from the Democrats in William Jefferson Clinton\u2019s 1999 impeachment trial and argue that the president\u2019s mistakes in judgment don\u2019t merit removal from office. They will ignore the obvious distinction between Clinton lying about sex and Trump personifying corruption and will almost certainly create a constitutional crisis by adding an Article 2 claim that the inherent powers of the president allow him to, essentially, do whatever the hell he wants with the executive branch.", "description": "When voters hear \u201cno president is above the law,\u201d many want the law in question to be more like something out of a police procedural than a constitutional law seminar.", "authors": ["Jonathan Alter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571884948/191023-alter-trump-antishakedown-tease_gvcgip", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
