They set a deadline of Oct. 15 to comply.\n\nThe subpoena to the Defense Department seeks any recordings, transcripts or notes of Trump\u2019s phone conversations with Ukraine\u2019s president on April 21 and July 25; as well as information on efforts by administration officials and Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani to ask Ukrainian officials to investigate Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton.\n\nAlso, it seeks any opinions or advice on the legality of withholding congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine.\n\nVolker Leaves McCain Institute, Citing Media (11:26 a.m.)\n\nFormer U.S. envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, will step down as head of the McCain Institute, citing the \u201cmedia focus\u201d on his work in Ukraine, which Congress is investigating as part of Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Volker said he strove to build an organization \u201cdedicated to advancing character-driven leadership.\u201d He said he didn\u2019t want his involvement in allegations regarding Ukraine to become \u201ca distraction.\u201d\n\nVolker, who resigned from his unpaid diplomatic post after a rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s president was published, testified Thursday for more than eight hours to the three committees leading the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry. The former special envoy turned over text messages as part of his closed testimony that reflected discussion and some coordination between himself and other State Department officials with Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney.\n\nThe institute, named for late Senator John McCain, is based at Arizona State University. The university\u2019s head of National Security and Counterterrorism Programs and law professor Nick Rasmussen will take over as acting executive director, the statement said.\n\nState Department\u2019s Kent Won\u2019t Testify Monday (8:50 a.m.)\n\nGeorge Kent, the State Department official in Washington who oversees Ukraine policy, won\u2019t testify before Congress\u2019s impeachment investigators Monday, as was initially requested. The three House committees leading the probe are still discussing when his deposition can be rescheduled, according to a House official briefed on the plans.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland is still scheduled to appear privately Tuesday before members and staff of the the committees focusing on allegations regarding Ukraine in the House impeachment inquiry, the official said.\n\nMarie Yovanovitch, U.S. ambassador to Kiev from 2016 until Trump recalled her earlier this year, is also still set to testify on Friday before the Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform committees.\n\nKey Events\n\nThe whistle-blower\u2019s lead attorney, Andrew Bakaj, said Sunday his firm is now representing \u201cmultiple whistle-blowers\u201d in the complaint against Trump. Another lawyer with his firm, Mark Zaid, said the second whistle-blower has \u201cfirst hand knowledge\u201d of the matters and cannot be retaliated against.Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham said Sunday on Fox News that the whistle-blowers should be interviewed in public and under oath. He said the public should have the chance to \u201cjudge their credibility.\u201dHouse committees have subpoenaed the White House for documents on efforts by Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to pressure Ukraine. The committees want records related to a suspension of U.S. aid to Ukraine and the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Billy House in Washington at bhouse5@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Joe Sobczyk at jsobczyk@bloomberg.net, Laurie Ass\u00e9o, Anna Edgerton\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- House Democrats are moving forward with their impeachment investigation of Donald Trump, with the whistle-blower\u2019s lawyers saying they\u2019re now representing a second person with knowledge of the president\u2019s contacts with Ukraine.Here are the latest developments:Pentagon, OMB Subpoenaed for", "authors": ["Billy House"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/41.Fgehv0FGwHrDMX0a.aw--~B/aD0xMzUyO3c9MTgwMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/b24802aa02a407be603b346c4e77a89a", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
