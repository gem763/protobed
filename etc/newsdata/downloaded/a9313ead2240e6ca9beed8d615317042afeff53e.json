He was kissing his lips at me and she was making noises.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It was like something on a school playground when someone imitates your voice in a girly way. I felt like it was homophobic.\n\n\u2018She was saying something about sex and look at you. It all happened so fast. He hit me in the face and knocked my glasses off.\n\n\u2018I picked them up and could hear the sound of the train doors. Then the girl just looked at me and spat in my face. The guy then spat at me too.\u2019\n\nThomas, who was with his sister when he was assaulted, followed the couple to Seven Sisters station, when he phoned the police.\n\nThomas was on his way home from his best friend\u2019s wedding with his sister when he was assaulted (Picture: Thomas Johnson /Facebook)\n\nHe decided to follow the couple so he could get photos in the hope they could be quickly identified.\n\nBritish Transport Police said they are investigating a homophobic assault and have asked for witnesses to come forward.\n\nThomas, who works in Cardiff, said: \u2018This has made me feel so bad. I have suffered from depression in the past. I just can\u2019t believe this can happen in 2019.\n\n\u2018It was such a nice innocent day at my best friend\u2019s wedding then speaking to my dad. I\u2019m shaking just thinking about it.\n\n\u2018I work in customer service and it\u2019s made me feel so paranoid about customers saying something about me and judging me.\u2019\n\nEarlier this month government statistics showed a 25% rise in hate crime offences linked to sexual orientation since 2013.\n\nThomas said he feels scared using public transport after a rise in hate crime towards the LGBT community (Picture: Thomas Johnson)\n\nThomas said he purposely avoids getting the bus in London after a lesbian couple were attacked for allegedly refusing to kiss for two men\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the incident on Thursday left him \u2018traumatised\u2019 and feeling under pressure to change his appearance to draw less attention to himself.\n\nHe said: \u2018I think hate crime has gotten worse recently. I don\u2019t feel it is being taken seriously.\n\n\u2018I remember 10 years ago I would go to a gay club in baggy clothes and only change when I got there. I may have to start doing that again.\n\n\u2018Since that [London bus] attack I deliberately put more money on my oyster card so I can get a train instead of the bus.\n\n\u2018We ended up missing the last train waiting for police and I got in at about half two because we had to get night buses back home and walk.The night was just ruined.\n\n\u2018I was so upset and traumatised I decided to get a coach back to Cardiff at 4am because I just could not sleep.\u2019\n\nThe incident happened at Bruce Grove Station, north London (Picture: Google)\n\nConfirming the incident, a spokeswoman for British Transport police told Metro.co.uk: \u2018Officers received a report of a homophobic assault on a train between Bruce Grove and Seven Sisters shortly after 10pm on 17 October.\n\n\u2018It was reported a man and woman spat at the victim before boarding a service to Liverpool Street, where officers conducted a search of the area.
