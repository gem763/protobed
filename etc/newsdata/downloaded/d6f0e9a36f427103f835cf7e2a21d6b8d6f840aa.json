If that means I\u2019m off the roster, I don\u2019t mind that at all \u2014 at all,\u201d Sabathia told Yahoo Sports. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s about really me. This team has the chance to do something special. We\u2019ve been doing special things all year. I\u2019ve been a part of that. I don\u2019t think me being on or off the playoff roster will change what I\u2019ve been or done or meant around here. I\u2019ll be just as excited, especially if we win.\u201d\n\nSep 18, 2019; Bronx, NY, USA; New York Yankees starting pitcher CC Sabathia (52) reacts after being taken out of the game against the Los Angeles Angels during the third inning at Yankee Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Andy Marlin-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFinding the right 25 men\n\nSabathia, 39, announced last offseason that this season would be his last, allowing for one final season in New York to chase a second championship. Sabathia and Brett Gardner are the only remnants from the Yankees\u2019 2009 title team, the only Yankees team to win a championship since the 2000 season.\n\nWhile it would seem cruel if the Yankees keep Sabathia off the roster in his final season considering all he\u2019s meant to this organization in his 11 seasons in the Bronx, the harsh reality is the playoffs are not for sentimentality.\n\nIt\u2019s about winning 11 or 12 games. These same Yankees even famously dropped Alex Rodriguez to the eighth hole once.\n\nStory continues\n\nTeams put together what they believe is their best 25-man roster for that particular series, and due to ineffectiveness and injuries, Sabathia\u2019s potential postseason role is in question. He owns a 4.99 ERA after allowing two runs in 2.2 innings in his potential final outing at Yankee Stadium on Wednesday in a 3-2 loss to the Angels.\n\nA postseason start seems unlikely, and that will leave the front office to decide whether Sabathia can serve as a reliever. Sabathia has only pitched once in relief in 583 career outings, although that relief appearance came during the 2011 playoffs.\n\nSabathia held lefties to a .198/.266/.465/.731 slash line entering Wednesday, which could make him a potential LOOGY (aka left-handed one-out guy) in the middle innings. The Yankees will have short leashes for their starters this postseason.\n\nIf the Yankees want Sabathia to serve as a reliever, all he asks is that the team lets him pitch in relief in these final nine games to let him prepare.\n\n\u201c(The roster decision is) out of my hands. Yankees make those decisions, manager, front office guys. Whatever happens, happen,\u201d Sabathia said Tuesday afternoon. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll put the best team out there to win 11 games in October. If I\u2019m part of that, I\u2019ll do my job, be out there and try to get outs. If not, I\u2019ll do everything behind the scenes to try to help guys get ready and be ready to pitch.\u201d\n\nJul 9, 2019; Cleveland, OH, USA; New York Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia visits American League pitcher Aroldis Chapman (not pictured) of the New York Yankees on the mound during the ninth inning in the 2019 MLB All Star Game at Progressive Field. Mandatory Credit: Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports\n\nStaying healthy for one last shot\n\nIn addition to evaluating how Sabathia\u2019s stuff will play in October, the Yankees also need to be sure that Sabathia\u2019s body will cooperate.\n\nThat Sabathia is even healthy enough to be in play for a postseason roster spot is a victory considering it seemed he may have thrown the last pitch of his 19-season career on Aug. 30 against the Athletics.\n\nSabathia\u2019s right knee flared up that night, and Sabathia appeared downtrodden after the game, recognizing that his body might not allow him to pitch this October.\n\nThose fears proved to be graver than the reality of the situation, and Sabathia returned last Wednesday against Detroit.\n\nWhile Sabathia does not view his final outings this year as October auditions, he will have to show that he\u2019s past those latest knee issues.\n\nHe acknowledged there have been times he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d be in this position where his health would allow him to be an option for October.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long season and I wanted to be healthy and be here for the end. We\u2019ve seemed to accomplish that so far,\u201d Sabathia said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d\n\nTeammate Didi Gregorius hopes Sabathia will be on the team\u2019s postseason roster.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah, definitely,\u201d Gregorius said. \u201cHe\u2019s a warrior, man.\u201d\n\nSep 18, 2019; Bronx, NY, USA; New York Yankees starting pitcher CC Sabathia (52) is hugged by a teammate after being taken out of the game against the Los Angeles Angels during the third inning at Yankee Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Andy Marlin-USA TODAY Sports\n\nA proper sendoff for a legend\n\nAs he enters the stretch run of his career, Sabathia said that the finality of it all is not weighing on him. He did appreciate the sendoff he received Wednesday with the crowd giving him a standing ovation, and his teammates waiting for him.\n\nSabathia tipped his hat to the crowd knowing he may never pitch in the Bronx again.\n\n\u201cWalking off was cool. Seeing my mom, my wife, my kids happy. That was pretty cool,\u201d Sabathia said. \u201cWhen I saw (Yankees reliever) Dellin Betances, first person I saw, I got a little emotional. That\u2019s my little brother. \u201c\n\nHe added: \u201cThat was amazing. Nothing like the Bronx and New York City and put the pinstripes on. Got to do that for 11 years. Definitely a blessing.\u201d\n\nAfter the game, Sabathia and his teammates gathered to watch the end of the Dodgers-Rays game in hopes they could celebrate an AL East title. The Rays beat the Dodgers, 8-7, in 11 innings to delay the Yankees\u2019 celebrations.\n\nClinching the AL East is what Sabathia hopes will be just the first of several significant steps for this team with the ultimate goal of a title.\n\nIf he contributes to that championship, all the better. If not, he\u2019s OK with that too.\n\nSabathia just wants this final season to end with a 28th Yankees title.\n\n\u201cThis is what I came back for. I knew this team would be really good and this team was going to win a lot of games and I wanted to be a part of it,\u201d Sabathia said. \u201cIt would be awesome to be here (on the roster) at the end, for sure.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "CC Sabathia starts Wednesday, and it's uncertain if he will be  part of the Yankees' postseason roster.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YogoN8olSyr8mb5aTVCshA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NzAuNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OKPz1t6ASRqEY_mXzEZY1Q--~B/aD0xMjkwO3c9MTg5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/ee5f79c0-da89-11e9-b7ad-6fef9aeb85ee", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
