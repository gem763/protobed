The leasing deal is likely to have been struck with net face rent per square metre in the mid-$500 range, according to industry sources.\n\nThe AFP's new Melbourne home on Lonsdale Street.\n\nThe finalisation of the deal represents a major coup for Charter Hall, which worked with the federal agency on its requirements for the purpose-built $300 million tower with an underground car park.\n\n\u201cWe have worked closely with the AFP to design a bespoke property solution that will enable and support the AFP\u2019s important work around national security, counter-terrorism and continuing to make Australia a safer place,\u201d Charter Hall's managing director David Harrison said.\n\nThe new building will rise from a site Charter Hall already controls as part of its broader $1.3 billion Wesley Place precinct along Lonsdale Street at the eastern end of the city.", "description": "The finalisation of the deal represents a major coup for Charter Hall, which worked closely with the federal agency on in its requirements for the purpose-built $300 million tower.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.3244%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_816/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c5cc4b9bf821fcec0f28e61ce9623958b196d0af", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
