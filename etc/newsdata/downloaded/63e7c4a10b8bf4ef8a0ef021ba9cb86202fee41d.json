The people spoke to USA TODAY Sports on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the talks.\n\nNFL POWER RANKINGS: Texans rocket into top five, while Cowboys tumble from top half\n\nMORE: Inside DeMaurice Smith, NFLPA's meeting with Chiefs players on CBA discussions\n\nThe potential of an 18-game regular season was met with strong opposition among owners, so the focus shifted to a 17-game slate.\n\nHowever, nearly half of the owners oppose that setup as well and would prefer to continue playing just 16 games.\n\nA 17-game season isn\u2019t dead, but the owners need to hash out more details on such a setup.\n\nBeyond maintaining the usual Labor Day weekend start date and playing further into February, there are currently few concrete ideas on how the league would make a 17-game season work.\n\nQuestions during the owners\u2019 discussions involved how they would determine if that 17th game would represent an extra home game for half the teams, or if it would be an international game.\n\nShortening the preseason by a week also could come into play. And the matter of implementing an additional bye week also was discussed. However, the owners reached no real resolutions at this time.\n\nFrom the players\u2019 standpoint, there\u2019s a level of reservation of playing an extended regular season because of questions involving the additional physical toll it would subject them to, and how a 17-game slate would impact their salaries.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports\u2019 Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMikeJones and listen to the Football Jones podcast on iTunes.", "description": "Some NFL officials would like to expand the regular season schedule to 17 games, but there is opposition among the ownership ranks.", "authors": ["Mike Jones", "Published P.M.
