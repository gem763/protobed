Investing.com -- Stocks in focus in premarket trade on Tuesday, 24th September. Facebook (NASDAQ: ) was up 0.5% in premarket trade by 8:20 AM ET (12:20 GMT) after announcing it is acquiring start-up CTRL-labs for an undisclosed amount. Tesla (NASDAQ: ) rose 0.4% despite news of a lawsuit alleging CEO Elon Musk urged shareholders to overpay for its 2016 purchase of SolarCity. Anheuser- Busch Inbev dipped 1.7% after the brewer raised about $5 billion in the Hong Kong initial public offering of its Asia-Pacific unit, which was at the bottom of the expected price range. Blackberry (TSX: ) fell 13.6% after another miss on earnings and revenue, detailed in a release which again failed to conform to SEC guidelines. Starbucks (NASDAQ: ) gained 0.5% after it won an appeal against the European Union's antitrust authorities, which had demanded it pay up to $33 million in back taxes to the Netherlands. Apple (NASDAQ: ) jumped 0.9% after Jefferies upgraded it to 'buy' from 'hold', saying consensus estimates for iPhone sales are too conservative and its opportunities in services are underestimated. Autozone was in focus after its profit missed estimates, but revenue came in higher than expected as sales increased 12% from the prior year.\n\nStocks: Facebook, Starbucks Rise in Premarket; Blackberry Slumps", "description": "Stocks:  Facebook, Starbucks Rise in Premarket; Blackberry Slumps", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB350LC_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
