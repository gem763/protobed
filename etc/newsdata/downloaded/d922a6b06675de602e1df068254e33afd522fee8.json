Sexy nurse. Sexy Mr. Rogers? Inside the sexy Halloween costume industrial complex.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cBlow that whistle!\u201d said designer Pilar Quintana-Williams as the camera flashed.\n\nOf course there is a sexy impeachment costume. Yandy, a lingerie and costume company where Quintana-Williams is the vice president of merchandising, can hook you up with pretty much any kind of sexy costume you want \u2014 sexy witch, sexy nurse, sexy pirate, sexy Buzz Lightyear, sexy Supreme Court justice, sexy clown from \u201cIt,\u201d sexy pizza, sexy Minion. In recent years, the company has specialized in costumes with highly topical themes taken from politics and pop culture, so when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, it took Yandy barely a week to turn around its Miss Impeachment outfit.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cCan you do a little bit of a surprised face? Like, I just won my pageant!\u201d Quintana-Williams asked Fiacco.\n\n\u201cLike, I\u2019m going to Disney World!\u201d said photographer Brittany Gentile.\n\n\u201cOr jail!\u201d Quintana-Williams added.\n\nA perfect segue to Fiacco\u2019s next costume: Sexy college admissions scandal. It consisted of an orange prison uniform, but with leggings and a crop top. \u201cINMATE\u201d was stenciled across the chest, under the crossed-out text reading \u201cMom of the Year.\u201d\n\n\u201cHandcuffs or no handcuffs?\u201d Quintana-Williams asked. \u201cThey\u2019re plain, though \u2014 they\u2019re not furry, right?\u201d\n\nAn important distinction, because for the other 11 months of the year, Yandy primarily sells sexy underwear and fetish toys, like whips and ball gags. But Halloween is a big season for a company whose slogan is \u201cOwn your sexy,\u201d with prices from $12.95 (a French maid) to $259.95 (the \u201cViking Deluxe.\u201d)\n\nOur Halloween traditions in their earliest form sprang from the ancient Celtic practice of donning animal-skin costumes to confuse the spirits roaming the Earth on their way to the afterlife. But nowadays, the living might find some of the season\u2019s risque and highly meta costumes confusing as well.\n\nThe rise of the sexy Halloween costume probably began sometime after the 1960s, but its biggest pop culture moment came in the 2004 movie \"Mean Girls.\" Cady, the naive heroine, arrives at a Halloween party dressed as a gory bride of Frankenstein only to find the popular girls dolled up as a sexy bunny, sexy cat and sexy mouse. Oct. 31, she realizes, \"is the one day a year when a girl can dress up like a total slut and no other girls can say anything else about it.\" Sex-advice columnist Dan Savage once called the yearly display of flesh a \"Straight Pride Parade.\" \"Halloween is now the big public celebration of straight sexuality, of heterosexual desire,\" he wrote in 2009.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf a shopper is in the market for a sexy Halloween costume, there\u2019s a good chance their search engine will deliver them to Yandy.com, which since its founding in 2007 has become the most prominent online purveyor of attire for sexy witches, zombies, Catwomen and nuns.\n\nThose aren\u2019t the ones that have made the company infamous, though. When a video of a New York City rat eating a piece of pizza captivated the Internet in 2015, Yandy stuck pizza-shaped pockets on a skimpy mouse costume to make a sexy pizza rat outfit. When a mild-mannered man with a red cable-knit sweater and a funny name went viral for asking a question during the 2016 presidential debates, Yandy turned out a Sexy Ken Bone costume (the sweater was a crop top).\n\nThis year\u2019s of-the-moment costumes include the \u201cNicest Neighbor,\u201d a.k.a. sexy Mister Rogers, timed to the upcoming biopic starring Tom Hanks; a sexy Beyond Burger, which is based on Yandy\u2019s regular sexy burger costume, plus a hat that says \u201cPlant based\u201d; and Sexy White Claw, which replaces the mega-popular hard seltzer\u2019s name with \u201cOutlaw\u201d in its logo, printed on a crop top with matching panty, so that Yandy won\u2019t get sued. Two weeks before Halloween, they put out a sexy sold-out Popeyes chicken sandwich.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEven though some of these may not be sexy, we have to make them sexy. We have to figure it out, whether it\u2019s giving it a high cut . . . cleavage or a plunging neckline,\u201d Quintana-Williams said. She is \u201c98 percent\u201d certain she could \u201cmake anything sexy at this point.\u201d (Sexy garbage can? Sexy Rudy Giuliani? Sexy Tylenol?)\n\nThat brings us to the sexy Halloween costume\u2019s most evolved form: the ironic sexy costume, which came into life as a meta punchline for cool girls who wanted to mock the trend while indulging in it with their own increasingly ridiculous DIY costumes. Sexy Abe Lincoln. Sexy Pepto-Bismol. Sexy Mormon missionary. Sexy Jar Jar Binks. Sexy Bernie Sanders. But then the big costume companies started doing ironic sexy, too, and now the whole thing has gotten murky: Is that woman wearing a sexy Mister Rogers costume because she is in on the joke? Or does she actually want to be a sultry version of America\u2019s kindest children\u2019s television host? Either way, Yandy wins.\n\nQuintana-Williams, 38, graduated from the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising and tries to keep the silhouettes on trend. \"A few years ago we were doing everything with rompers. This year, everything is in a bodysuit style,\" she said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWitches are coming back now after several dead years. Pirates, once a big seller, have dropped off. \u201cNinjas tend to be a little bit more naked, so they sell really, really, really well,\u201d she said.\n\nQuintana-Williams and her staff brainstorm ideas, sometimes with the help of spouses and friends, inputting one-line pop-culture concepts onto a Google spreadsheet with a separate field for the pertinent links to memes, news stories and movie release dates. A recent list included some fairly contrived pitches \u2014 Sexy Little Lies (a nod to \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d), \u201cDetective Pikachu,\u201d sexy Fyre Festival and \u201cVape Goddess,\u201d probably too risky now that there\u2019s a vape-related lung disease. And if you want to be Fat Thor from Avengers, you\u2019ll have to make it yourself. Same goes for \u201csexy AOC,\u201d an homage to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that was scuttled before the design phase.\n\n\u201cSome of us thought yes, some of us thought no, some of us thought, \u2018Well, I think [she] would like it.\u2019 We\u2019d make it cute,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know you\u2019ve made it when there\u2019s been a costume.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYour feelings about Yandy might depend on what type of feminist you are. Perhaps you hate the notion of a sexy Halloween costume because you think it objectifies women and contributes to unrealistic beauty standards? Rebecca Bigler concurs. The retired professor at the University of Texas at Austin, who has written about female sexualization and Halloween, found in a 2014 study that pre-adolescent girls who care about looking sexy have lower grades: \u201cThey spend less effort trying to be competent because they\u2019re trying to look sexy and putting that effort to their appearance.\u201d And Bigler argues that trends for adult Halloween costumes end up influencing the design of girls\u2019 costumes, which, in turn, prime girls to obsess over appearance in their teen and adult years.\n\nBut another group of feminists begs to differ. Feminists like Quintana-Williams. Who think the backlash to sexy costumes reeks of slut-shaming.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re empowering women to be themselves and whatever it is that they want to do, and if it\u2019s wearing your costume that has more coverage or if it\u2019s wearing a costume that doesn\u2019t, do you, girl,\u201d she said.\n\nLucy Powell, 27, a 911 dispatcher from Herriman, Utah, owns two Yandy costumes: a sexy paratrooper and a sexy ninja. \u201cI\u2019m going to get a costume that\u2019s going to accentuate my curves and make me feel strong and confident,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to embrace what I have. I think we should be empowering each other to feel that way.\u201d (This argument induces a sigh from Bigler: \u201cIt is the patriarchy that benefits from women\u2019s massive spending on cosmetics and plastic surgery and sexy costumes.\u201d)\n\nLast year, Yandy came under fire for its \u201cBrave Red Maiden\u201d, i.e., a sexy riff on the Margaret Atwood-inspired TV series \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d In an alternate universe, it might have been clever. But in this one, where protesters have borrowed the red cloak/white hood garb of the dystopia\u2019s sexually enslaved women to make a serious point about challenges to reproductive rights \u2014 well, it didn\u2019t go over so great. Yandy took it off its website and apologized.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe were seeing it everywhere, obviously, during [Brett] Kavanaugh,\u201d Quintana-Williams said, recalling the scene outside the 2018 Supreme Court confirmation hearings. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think of it, to be honest. It was something that we were seeing out there, so we just came up with our own version.\u201d\n\nNative American activists have protested outside of Yandy\u2019s headquarters several times over the company\u2019s multiple iterations of sexy indigenous attire. \u201cThere are higher rates of violence and sexual violence against native women,\u201d said Amanda Blackhorse, a Native American advocate who is a Din\u00e9 and a member of the Navajo Nation. \u201cCostumes and mascots, they dehumanize native people, in general. They allow people to make fun of us, use us as tokens, and treat us like animals.\u201d\n\nLate this summer, Yandy removed the Native American costumes from its site but did not apologize, according to Zoe Dejecacion, a member of the Choctaw tribe who started a petition for Yandy to remove the costumes. \u201cThe least that they could do is issue a statement that they were wrong.\u201d Quintana-Williams declined to comment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYandy has other costumes just waiting to be called out for cultural appropriation: There\u2019s a geisha costume still active on the website, as well as a \u201cmen\u2019s authentic Mexican tequila costume\u201d \u2014 basically, a poncho and a sombrero.\n\nAs Halloween gets more woke, \u201cmaybe there\u2019s gonna be some backlash and some costumes or different opinions,\u201d said \u00adQuintana-Williams, who noted that she is of Mexican descent. \u201cAny time that we\u2019re putting stuff out there, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nHalloween costumes are not very sexy in a warehouse. At Yandy's massive clearinghouse on Phoenix's northern fringe, they are balled up in plastic bags inside canyons of brown boxes. Workers scurry around the floor fulfilling orders, but things don't get super busy until the weeks leading up to Halloween, when Quintana-Williams says they will ship as many as 9,000 orders a day. (During nonpeak season, it's closer to 1,000 per day.) The National Retail Federation anticipates that Americans will spend $3.2 billion on Halloween costumes in 2019. Yandy's annual revenue totals approximately $50 million, about a quarter of which comes from Halloween sales.\n\nThe prop genie lamps are shelved under the five-piece \u201csoft cuff hogties\u201d sets, near the sexy Statue of Liberty costumes. Boxes are labeled with cheeky names like \u201cOfficer Lauren Order,\u201d or bland ones designed to evade infringement: What\u2019s obviously a Cher costume is \u201c70s Icon,\u201d and it\u2019s a \u201cPlaytime\u201d bunny, not Playboy. The company has recently branched out into dog costumes, too.\n\n\u201cI was actually telling the girls to make sure the search engine optimization says \u2018sexy pet costumes,\u2019 \u201d Quintana-Williams laughed, though sexy dog costumes are, mercifully, not yet a thing.\n\nIt\u2019s the default word. Sometimes they try \u201csultry\u201d or \u201csassy.\u201d But \u201cSassy Tariff\u201d doesn\u2019t have quite the same ring as \u201cSexy Tariff,\u201d which of course is just a skimpy money-print minidress with the word \u201cTariff\u201d printed across the bust in red and \u201cimport\u201d printed on the butt.", "description": "Of course there\u2019s a sexy impeachment costume.
