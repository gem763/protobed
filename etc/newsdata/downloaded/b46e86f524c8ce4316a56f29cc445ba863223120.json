You\u2019re not going to get rid of me.\u2019\n\n\u2018How do they get rid of you?\u2019 asked Susanna.\n\nPiers replied: \u2018I don\u2019t think this has been worked through.\n\n\u2018They think that making me trend worldwide for two days, ie making me the most talked-about breakfast presenter in the world, that is the way to get rid of me.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018Let me tell you what you\u2019ve done, you\u2019ve helped me get a pay rise. So, cheers. Cheers everybody.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn top of the poll, there are also two online campaigns circulating online regarding Piers\u2019 future on Good Morning Britain.\n\nOne Change.org petition has seen 22,309 people call for Piers\u2019 removal while another has 46,288 people back his position on the show.\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
