Two of its promoters were attacked.\n\nStill, tens of thousands of black-clad protesters filled the streets of Hong Kong on Sunday in a display of continuing support for the monthslong protest movement despite increasing restrictions from the authorities. The march, which passed some of the most prominent centers of Hong Kong\u2019s South Asian community, also featured a call for solidarity with the city\u2019s ethnic minorities.\n\nThe demonstration began peacefully, eventually punctuated by outbursts of vandalism to shops, bank branches and subway stations. In a reprise of the clashes that have grown common, protesters threw firebombs at the police and officers fired multiple rounds of tear gas at demonstrators.\n\nAnd there were hints of possible escalations in violence. The police used a robot to dispose of a suspected homemade bomb on a street in the Prince Edward neighborhood. It was not immediately clear what danger, if any, the object posed.\n\nOne week ago, the police said that a homemade bomb was detonated, a first for the protests. The explosive device, which was set off by a mobile phone, did not harm anyone.", "description": "The Sunday demonstration, which followed 20 weeks of antigovernment protests, is a test of the movement\u2019s strength amid increasing violence", "authors": ["Austin Ramzy", "Alexandra Stevenson"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/20/world/20hongkong04/20hongkong04-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
