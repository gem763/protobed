The piece was an excerpt from their upcoming book, \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation.\u201d\n\nWe also uncovered a previously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh in his freshman year that echoes Ms. [Deborah] Ramirez\u2019s allegation. A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student. Mr. Stier, who runs a nonprofit organization in Washington, notified senators and the F.B.I. about this account, but the F.B.I. did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly. (We corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier.)\n\nAccording to the Huffington Post, Pogrebin and Kelly \"looked into both Ramirez\u2019s and Ford\u2019s claims for their upcoming book, which takes a deeper look into Kavanaugh\u2019s prep school and Ivy League days in an attempt to piece together who he is.\"\n\nThe Times promoted the piece with a tasteless tweet, which was eventually deleted.\n\nWhat are they thinking at the New York Times? 1) It's a discredited allegation. 2) If it had happened, such things are 'harmless fun'? pic.twitter.com/zBUmj0Ghqq \u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) September 15, 2019\n\nDeborah Ramirez's allegations against Kavanaugh came out during his confirmation process last fall. She claimed he exposed himself during a party in a dorm room in 1983 but was reluctant to come forward because she had been drinking and her memory was foggy.\n\nIt's important to remember one important tidbit from a previous Times piece: they couldn't find any corroborating evidence:", "description": "Geez..09/15/2019 19:09:14PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/270/cd5fea95-03a2-44ab-9f27-f384e9b5282b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
