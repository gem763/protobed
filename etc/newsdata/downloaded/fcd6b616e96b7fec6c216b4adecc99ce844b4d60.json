(more concerned) about investing in Hong Kong real estate, so they carry that investment to Singapore,\" said Alan Cheong, executive director of the research and consultancy team at Savills.\n\nAs well as hitting China's economy, trade tensions may have discouraged some Chinese from investing in the West and pushed them towards Singapore, with its mostly ethnic Chinese population.\n\n\"I think they don't want to go to the West,\" said Cheong.\n\nSingapore is \"the closest country culturally to China other than Hong Kong, and I think they feel more comfortable with that\".\n\nThere are further signs the stable, tightly ruled city is benefiting from the Hong Kong turmoil -- Goldman Sachs last week estimated as much as $4 billion flowed out of Hong Kong to Singapore this summer.\n\nAnd analysts warned there was little hope of Hong Kong's property market recovering soon.\n\n\"Hong Kong property share prices have corrected by about 15 to 25 percent since July,\" said Raymond Cheng, head of Hong Kong and China property at CGS-CIMB Securities International.\n\nResidential sales were still holding up but only when developers offered discounts, office rents were expected to fall by as much as five percent and shop rents were also badly affected, he said.\n\nBut despite the unrest, businessman Ng -- who will rent his Penang property and has no plans to move there permanently for now -- was still hopeful about Hong Kong's long-term prospects.\n\n\"The problem may not be solved in the short term but it is not so serious as pessimists think,\" he said. \"Everything is still in the government's control.\"\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "From luxury Singapore apartments to Malaysian seafront condos, Hong Kong investors are shifting cash into Southeast Asian property, demoralised by increasingly violent protests as well as the China-U.S. trade war.
