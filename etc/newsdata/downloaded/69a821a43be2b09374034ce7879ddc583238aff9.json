Needs to be a sensible deal which unionists and nationalists can support.\u2019\n\nSaturday is a key date for the Prime Minister, with the Benn Act passed by MPs trying to prevent a no-deal Brexit stating he must write to Brussels asking for a delay if Parliament does not agree to a deal by then.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPressure to sign off on a draft agreement is peaking.\n\nA legal text needs to be published ahead of the summit if the EU27 are to consider ratifying the Withdrawal Agreement at the two-day event.\n\nTheir approval would allow Mr Johnson to put the deal to MPs in a proposed extraordinary sitting of Parliament on Saturday, between 9.30am and 2pm.\n\nDuring the weekend session, MPs would be able to back or reject any deal presented to them, or discuss what to do next in the Brexit saga.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
