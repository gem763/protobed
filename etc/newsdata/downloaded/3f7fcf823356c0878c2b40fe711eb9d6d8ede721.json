AAP\n\nAnd while the suburb may have smaller blocks, relative to Peppermint Grove, it hasn't stopped several residents along the riverside from securing large estates through the accumulation of properties.\n\nThe suburb's biggest landholding belongs to Australia's second-richest person, mining magnate Gina Rinehart.\n\nNot content with just one illustrious mansion on the banks of the Swan River, Rinehart, through various holding companies, owns three houses in a cluster, a strip of land next door, which she bought in the 1990s from Ralph Sarich, once Australia's best-known investor, and an adjoining empty block, which is on the market for $9 million.\n\nGina Rinehart's large estate. Trevor Collens\n\nThe sprawling estate has been a family affair, with Gina having inherited the 1930s mansion her father Lang Hancock bought in the 1950s.\n\nIt is understood Gina lives in the newer house closest to the riverfront while her estranged son John had previously lived in the workman's cottage next door.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKerry Stokes and his wife Christine Simpson Parker. Supplied\n\nBut Rinehart certainly isn't the only billionaire in Dalkeith to have beefed up landholdings on the riverfront. Further east is none other than long-time resident media tycoon Kerry Stokes, chairman of Seven West.\n\nStokes, who is worth $5.69 billion according to this year's AFR Rich List, has lived in the neighbourhood since the 1970s when he paid $200,000 for his 3200sq m block.\n\nKerry Stokes' property is well hidden from the river. Trevor Collens\n\nHis stylish home, which in the 1980s was described by The Sydney Morning Herald as akin to \"something like the Hanging Gardens of Babylon\", with a swimming pool enclosed in glass, is currently undergoing a major refurbishment.\n\nLast year Stokes and son Ryan (as directors of a company) spent $11 million on a property three doors down, with five bedrooms, an internal lift and a boathouse, which was rumoured to have been bought as interim accommodation while renovations on his home were under way. It's also been speculated it was been bought as a future Perth residence for Ryan.\n\nStokes bought this house as interim accommodation last year. Supplied\n\nNot just a suburb for homegrown billionaires, Dalkeith is also where some surprisingly high-profile overseas buyers have chosen to live when visiting Australia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn between Stokes' two properties happens to be the family holiday compound of Indonesia's second richest person, billionaire and tobacco tycoon Michael Bambang Hartono.\n\nThe Hartono family own the two properties by the water and the large property on the hill behind. Trevor Collens\n\nHartono and his brother Robert inherited clove cigarette manufacturing company Djarum from their father and he invested money in Bank Central Asia, which has yielded the 79-year-old a personal fortune of $US18.6 billion ($27.48 billion), according to Forbes.\n\nHartono bought the mammoth block on Jutland Parade and has since sub-divided the land and developed five houses on it: the largest for his wife and him, one each for their two children (fronting the river) and the other two they have offloaded.\n\nNot far from Hartono's family compound is the crash pad of another wealthy offshore homeowner, billionaire Malaysian royal the Sultan of Johor.\n\nSultan Ibrahim Ismail and his wife Raja Zarith Sofiah, who have long enjoyed Perth as a holiday destination, bought a 2000sq m block of riverfront land from the WA government for $8.5 million in 2015 and have been building a three-storey residence on what was once the Dalkeith Sunset \u00adHospital matron\u2019s house.\n\nThe Sultan of Johor's house has been under construction for several years. Trevor Collens\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColossal family compounds are all the rage in this part of the neighbourhood with unprecedented levels of construction on the riverbanks under way.\n\nLocal manufacturing family the Francos, who in 2018 sold their company Fero Group to DSI Underground, are in the midst of massive building operation along the riverfront.\n\nThe Franco family is building a huge compound. Trevor Collens\n\nLand titles show co-founder of Fero Group Mario Franco and his wife Immacolata first bought into the neighbourhood for $4.55 million, followed by son Robert who spent $9 million on the mansion next door in 2013. Their other son Michael also owns a block on the mega-site that's undergoing major construction.\n\nMeanwhile, Mario's daughter Laura owns the house across the road, which was bought in 2009 for $4.5 million.\n\nOther notable residents include prominent Perth barrister and former WA governor Malcolm McCusker, who bought into the neighbourhood for $20 million in 2009 and has also bolstered his assets in the suburb, as well as Navitas' Peter Larsen, and wife Joelle, who bought two neighbouring riverfront properties for $5.35 million.\n\nFlying under the radar is also mining heiress and billionaire Angela Bennett.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAngela Bennett sold her mansion across the river in 2009 for a record $57.5 million. Supplied\n\nBennett, whose wealth traces back to the Pilbara mining ventures of her late father Peter Wright and his business partner Lang Hancock, set a national house price record when she sold her sprawling Mosman Park mansion across the river for $57.5 million in 2009.\n\nIn comparison the Dalkeith home which she bought for $3.1 million last year (one of several properties she owns around Perth including her $8 million penthouse) is markedly understated with five bedrooms on a suburban street away from the water.\n\nSue Gibson's mansion, which is on the market. Trevor Collens\n\nOf all the impressive mansions on the riverfront in Dalkeith, perhaps the most spectacular is on the market. The suburb's crown jewel, Alan Bond's former residence, which is a sprawling estate set on 6400sq m.\n\nThe six-bedroom mansion, which is owned by Sue Gibson, the former partner of mining magnate Steve Wyatt, was listed for sale in 2018 with a price tag of $50 million, which has since been dropped to $43 million.\n\nSue Gibson's mansion that she bought in 2011 with then-partner mining magnate Steve Wyatt. Supplied\n\nDavies, who is selling a four-bedroom riverfront property on Jutland Parade with a price guide of more than $8 million, said he had recently witnessed the first signs of \"renewed looking\" from potential buyers after the market had been \"bouncing along ... with very little upward movement\" since 2011.\n\n\"We had an extraordinary boom in 2005 \u2026 to the early part of 2008. For one of those years in 18 months the prices in Dalkeith went up 54 per cent. Then we came to the GFC in 2008 and the market collapsed in a heap and went back about 30 per cent,\" he says.\n\nBut Davies is confident property prices will now pick up with several pieces of good news for the WA economy.\n\n\"Mining exploration has been going gangbusters for two years. The three major mining companies announced last year they were going into new mining construction which totalled about $700-plus billion, we have finally got double the GST share that we were previously getting [under the federal government's GST reform package] ... and we had a record grain harvest in monetary terms last year,\" Davies says.", "description": "Foreign billionaires and some of Australia's richest residents are building large family compounds in this Perth suburb.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6542%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_41/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c25df2758aaaa84f089dfb7fe11022e63bcd9947", "published_at": "2019-07-15"}
