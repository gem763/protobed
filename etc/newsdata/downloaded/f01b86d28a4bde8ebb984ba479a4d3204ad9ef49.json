Hong / Business Insider\n\nIn some countries, children make up a disproportionately high percentage of the population.\n\nThe World Bank tracks the percentage of each country's population that's aged 14 or younger.\n\nAmong the countries with the most children are Nigeria, Afghanistan, and Uganda.\n\nSouth Africa, for all its reputation as a young country, is pretty old in African terms.\n\nFor more stories go to www.BusinessInsider.co.za.\n\nThe world's population is ageing, thanks to improving vaccines, antibiotics, and other medical technologies.\n\nBut some countries are still disproportionately young - with children comprising as much as 50% of their populations.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, disproportionately young populations typically belong to developing countries due to poverty, high child mortality rates, and a lack of infrastructure, medical resources, and education.\n\nIn recent years, scholars such as economist Andre Gunder Frank have also cited European colonisation of these countries during the 16th to 20th centuries as a cause to the overall lack of resources leading to disproportionately young populations.\n\nThe World Bank tracks the percentage of each country's population under the age of 15, allowing us to see which countries had disproportionately young populations in 2018, the most recent year for which data is available.\n\nThough South Africa has a large population of young people \u2013 and a reputation as a young country \u2013 it is practically ancient by the standard of many African countries. According to the latest available population estimates a little under 20% of the population is under the age of 15 right now.\n\nBy contrast there are 25 countries in the world, most of them elsewhere in Africa, where where children make up more than 40% of the population.\n\nThese are the countries with a much higher proportion of children than South Africa.\n\n25.
