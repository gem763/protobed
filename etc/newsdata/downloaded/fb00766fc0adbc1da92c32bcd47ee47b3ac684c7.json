According to market watchdog Consob, investment funds Engadine Partners, Ennismore Fund Management, Think Investments currently hold a combined short position of 3.7% in the stock.\n\n\u201cFICTITIOUS TRANSACTIONS\u201d\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, tax police said the probe had shown that \u201ca large part of the revenues booked in the company\u2019s accounts from 2015 to 2018 were false ... while part of the revenues generated by licenses from two joint ventures booked in 2018 were the result of fictitious transactions\u201d.\n\nThe prosecutor accused Astorri of giving false information to mislead investors and boost Bio-on shares.\n\nThe company, which was worth over 1 billion euros before Quintessential leveled its accusations, has today a market cap of less than 200 million euros.\n\nThe Milan stock market said on Wednesday Bio-on shares had been suspended from trading.\n\nBio-on, which produces what it says are environmentally-friendly plastics for the agri-food, design and cosmetics industries, was founded by Astorri in 2007.\n\nThe company, whose customers include consumer goods company Unilever (ULVR.L), (UNA.AS), listed seven year later on Milan\u2019s AIM market, an unregulated segment of the Italian stock exchange dedicated to small and medium-sized companies.\n\n(Graphic: Bio-on shares burst, here)", "description": "The head of Italy's Bio-on was arrested on Wednesday in a probe into false accounting and market manipulation, just three months after the bio-plastics maker suffered an attack by a short seller fund that erased 80% of its value.", "authors": ["Valentina Accardo", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
