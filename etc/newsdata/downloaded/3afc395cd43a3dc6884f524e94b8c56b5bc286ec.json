The pair (pictured together in 2011) sang Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me in 1991\n\nSir Elton John opened up to Sharon Osbourne about George Michael's state of mind before his death\n\nSir Elton had called Sharon after George Michael died almost three years ago.\n\nRecalling their conversation he said: 'I remember talking to you the day he died on Christmas Day.\n\n'And I phoned you and I was in Aspen and Ozzy got on the phone and he said, \"He didn't want to be here.\"\n\n'And I thought that's the most succinct apt thing: \"he didn't want to be here\". He was so uncomfortable in his skin about being gay even though he said he wasn't.'\n\nEarlier this month his Wham! bandmate Andrew Ridgeley, 56, has told how the \u2018fa\u00e7ade\u2019 of heterosexuality was a burden on his friend as he refused to publicly reveal that he was gay, believing it would damage his career.\n\nWhile Michael came out to school friend Ridgeley way back in 1983, while they were shooting the music video for Club Tropicana in Ibiza, it would be 15 years before the rest of the world knew.\n\nMichael\u2019s \u2018persona which he constructed for public consumption\u2019 didn\u2019t give him space to \u2018develop his true self\u2019, Ridgeley wrote in his new autobiography.\n\nSir Elton, 72, opened up to Sharon Osbourne on her American chat show, The Talk\n\nSir Elton had called Sharon after George Michael died almost three years ago\n\nHe said the singer was \u2018beset by confusion as a consequence of his sexuality\u2019 and struggled to \u2018define the reality beneath the public image\u2019, causing a tension which \u2018only seemed to play out more publicly later on.\u2019\n\n\u2018Beyond the close inner circle nobody really had a clue, so while the reality of maintaining the fa\u00e7ade wasn\u2019t tearing George apart, some cracks were definitely starting to show,\u2019 he wrote.\n\nHe said that Michael\u2019s \u2018ambition to succeed had taken priority over everything else and that included his ability to openly express his sexuality.\u2019\n\nAccording to Ridgeley, the pop star struggled with the public persona he created so he didn\u2019t have to reveal his true self.\n\n\u2018The persona which he constructed for public consumption hadn\u2019t left George with a lot of space in which to develop his true self behind the scenes,\u2019 he wrote.\n\n\u2018He was driven by an unstoppable desire to fulfil his potential, but that had come at a price. As a young man still trying to find himself, George\u2019s ambition to succeed had taken priority over everything else and that included his ability to openly express his sexuality.\u2019\n\nSharon Osbourne spoke to Sir Elton about his close friend George\n\nHe said that his decision to stay silent about his private life \u2018only fed the uncertainty about his public persona.\n\n\u2018What the real implications were for George, I can\u2019t say, but I knew he was never comfortable with the added interest that came with Wham! hitting the big time.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018While on tour, working with Wham!, George was presenting a public image that didn\u2019t come naturally to him.\u2019\n\nHe said that George was \u2018adamant his sexuality should be kept under wraps\u2019 which \u2018created a whole unwelcome extra level of stress for him to manage.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018I had certainly never met any boyfriend that George might have had while we were together as a band.\n\n\u2018He thought coming out would scupper chances of competing with artists like Madonna and Michael Jackson in the States.\u2019\n\nMichael refused to come out even after his boyfriend Anselmo Feleppa died from AIDs in 1993.", "description": "Sir Elton, 72, who famously performed Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me with George in 1991, said his friend 'didn't want to be here' before his death in Oxfordshire on Christmas Day 2016.", "authors": ["Martin Robinson Chief Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/15/20138156-0-image-a-31_1571928959283.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
