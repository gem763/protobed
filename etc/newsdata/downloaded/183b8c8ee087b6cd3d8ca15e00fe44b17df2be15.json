REUTERS/Martyn Herman\n\nWith incessant rain reducing the most of the world\u2019s elite road racers to bedraggled wrecks, 23-year-old Pedersen proved more durable as he sprinted through the gloom to the rainbow jersey after nearly six-and-a-half hours of toil.\n\nIn doing so the Trek-Segafredo rider became the first Dane to claim the world title in the men\u2019s road race.\n\nWith the hopes of pre-race favourites Dutchman Mathieu van der Poel and Belgian Philippe Gilbert down the drain and three-time champion Peter Sagan too far back, Pedersen found himself in a three-man fight for victory halfway round the last of nine 14km circuits of leafy Harrogate.\n\nKeeping him company were experienced Swiss Stefan Kung, who he had joined at the front with 60km left, and Italian dangerman Matteo Trentin.\n\nWith thousands fans hammering the railings along Parliament Street, the lung-busting drag up to the finish, Trentin made his move first. But his tank was empty and Pedersen swarmed past him like a marauding Viking for victory.\n\nSwiss Kung rolled home for the bronze.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s every rider\u2019s dream to wear the rainbow jersey. For me to do it now is unbelievable,\u201d Pedersen, runner-up in last year\u2019s Tour of Flanders, said.\n\n\u201cIt was just survive and hope for the best. I hoped that when I saw the finish line all the pain would be gone and I could do a good sprint,\u201d added Pedersen, who could barely stand up after getting off his bike in the finish area.\n\nTrentin, three-times a Tour de France stage winner and second in this month\u2019s Tour of Britain, looked crestfallen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never in the pocket. Today was incredibly hard,\u201d he said. \u201cOne guy has the jersey, two guys have a medal, everyone else has nothing.\u201d\n\nThe predicted flood arrived on cue at the start in Leeds. With so much rain falling on the course, it was re-routed to avoid the Buttertubs climb in the north Yorkshire Dales.\n\nMAD MEN\n\nJust as well, considering the suffering in the peloton.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a world championship for mad men,\u201d last year\u2019s winner Alejandro Valverde told a Spanish TV crew after quitting.\n\nA high-quality breakaway group, including Giro d\u2019Italia winner Richard Carapaz, Vuelta winner Primoz Roglic and Nairo Quintana got four minutes clear at one point as they ploughed on through puddles made for kayaks not bicycles.\n\nBy the time the race arrived in Harrogate for nine rollercoaster laps around the town\u2019s drenched streets, the leaders had been reeled and riders were abandoning in droves, including Roglic, Quintana and Carapaz.\n\nVeteran Belgian Gilbert\u2019s hopes ended when he crashed on the first of nine Harrogate circuits and despite the valiant efforts of teenage team mate Remco Evenepoel to get him back into the race he quit in tears.\n\nSo appalling was the weather there was no live footage for an hour as the TV helicopters were grounded by low cloud and only 46 of the 197 starters finished.\n\nBut the elements did not deter the thousands of fans lining Harrogate\u2019s streets under a forest of umbrellas.\n\nThey were rewarded with a thrilling climax.\n\nAmerican Lawson Craddock and Kung made the first move and led a reduced peloton by 20 seconds with 52km left.\n\nWhen Craddock cracked, Kung was joined by Pedersen, Dutch tyro Van der Poel, Italian Gianno Moscon and Trentin.\n\nWith Van der Poel looking string the stage was set for a Dutch party with one lap left but he cracked in spectacular fashion, grinding to a virtual standstill.\n\nMoscon blew up 5km from the end leaving three survivors and on the grimmest of days, the unheralded Pedersen found his rainbow.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cIt was brutal, a rough day, six and a half hours on the bike, 10, 12 degrees and a lot of water,\u201d Pedersen said. \u201cIt was a really tough day but that\u2019s the way I like to race.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m finished with playing underdog, that\u2019s pretty impossible now.\u201d\n\nSlovakian Sagan left it too late to snatch a record fourth world road title as he finished behind Moscon in fifth.", "description": "Denmark's Mads Pedersen withstood everything a wild day in Yorkshire could throw at him to ride to a shock victory in a thrilling climax to the UCI Road World Championships on Sunday.", "authors": ["Martyn Herman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435289769&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S0S6", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
