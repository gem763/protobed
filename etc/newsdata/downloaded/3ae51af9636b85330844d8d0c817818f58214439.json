Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment enquiry into President Trump, torpedoing Wall Street stocks and the .\n\nThe President himself, exercised his democratic right to free speech, suggesting that no trade deal with China was better than a bad deal and which in turn, sent markets tumbling. Although the impeachment headlines have portrayed the President as a Roald Dahl-esque baddie, his comments via-a-vis China\u2019s trade practices remain valid. Free trade aficionados and Trumpa-nistas should be careful what they wish for though. If an impeachment enquiry looks like it would be ending his re-election chances in 2020, he may throw caution to the wind and harden his attitude to a China trade deal, increasing the chances of a global recession next year.\n\nDemocracy of another kind, in the form of corporate governance, was apparent as Adam Neumann, the CEO of WeWork, was told to take a WeWalk by investors after the failed IPO. The fact that WeWork owns a Gulfstream 650 private jet was a massive warning to me we were near \u201cpeak-Unicorn.\u201d Last night's decision makes this more so. The bar for loss-making Unicorns, with scorched-earth market share business models and asymmetric voting rights, will be much harder to foist on public markets going forward. Welcome to reality chaps.\n\nThe U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson also felt the chill winds of democracy and an independent judiciary as the U.K. Supreme Court judged his suspending of Parliament unlawful. The ensuing rally was a bit underwhelming. It probably reflected the uncertainty of both Mr Johnsons tenure and the Brexit process with October the 31st looming.\n\nMy best guess from here, as Mr Johnson returns sheepishly to London today, is that Brexit is extended on the proviso that a general election and or a second referendum is held. Other conspiracy theorists (and I am one), would suggest that Larry the Cat, the official mouser of No.10 Downing Street, has enacted his revenge for Mr Johnson bring a Jack Russel dog into the official residence.\n\nToday\u2019s highlight in Asia-Pacific will be the Reserve Bank ofNew Zealand (RBNZ) . The RBNZ is likely to leave rates unchanged at its record low of 1.0% with any move lower a huge surprise and see the much lower. The RBNZ\u2019s economic outlook will be of much more interest, as the Street is pencilling more cuts in the months ahead.\n\nAs I wrote on Monday, a lack of tier one data makes this week one where markets tend to headline chase back and forth daily. The end result is usually much intra-day , with weekly closes roughly where they started the week followed by head-scratching and mutterings of \u201cwhat just happened?\u201d I\u2019m pleased to say it is all going to plan so far.\n\nEquities\n\nThe impeachment hearing announcement delivered a knock-out blow to stocks markets already weak at the knees. All three major indices cratered. The fell 0.84%, the tech-heavy fell 1.46%, and the slid 0.53%.\n\nTreasury yields fell as investors dumped stocks and moved into the relative safety of bonds.In early Asia, both the and are lower by around 0.75%, and I would expect the rest of Asia to follow a similar path. With the data calendar so light today, headline-driven soundbites will rule the roost and investors may find watching from the sidelines a better strategy than getting whipsawed on intra-day volatility.\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe (CHF) and (JPY) were the primary beneficiaries of the flight to safety overnight, following the Trump trade comments and impeachment enquiry. The USD/CHF fell 0.42% to 0.9860, and the USD/JPY fell 0.43% to 107.10 while the and NZD made similar gains against the greenback.\n\nIn the NZD\u2019s case, the rally has shaky foundations ahead of the RBNZ rate decision today. Both AUD and NZD have a high beta to China trade, and it is unlikely the outlook there will be positive today.\n\nAlthough the dollar fell overnight against the G-10 currencies, regional currencies are unlikely to see the same gains. The fall was driven as much by trade jitters as it was by the impeachment announcement and regional Asia is much more sensitive to the former than the latter.\n\nOil\n\nGold\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s comments that he wouldn\u2019t accept a softer trade deal with China opened the taps on oil as both crude and WTI prices gushed lower. rising to 1.4 million barrels twisted the knife as Brent crude fell 3.30% to $63.20 a barrel, and WTI fell 2.80% to 454.50 a barrel.Oil is now facing the genuine possibility of completely unwinding the rally spurred by the Saudi Arabia attacks ten days ago. With Iranian representatives attending the U.N. in New York this week, the odds of further mischief in the Gulf are probably low. For this week anyway. Without some movement from the U.S. on sanctions, it is hard to see it staying that way and being short oil could be a dangerous strategy.In the short-term, however, the markets do look a little long, and negative trade soundbites are likely to cause further position culling. Asian trading will probably see oil meet plenty of sellers on any rallies unless we get another headline surprise.\n\nGold loved the uncertainty of the overnight session, powering through resistance to rise ten dollars, or 0.70%, to close at $1531.50 an ounce. The safe-haven trade was very much in evidence.\n\nA close above the resistance at $1525.00 implies a re-test of the September high at $1557.00 is in play. For that to happen though, we will need to procession of negative trade and political headlines to keep feeding the rally. In a week like this, that is a 50/50 probability, and thus, although gold\u2019s price action is impressively constructive, some caution is warranted at these levels.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by MarketPulse (Jeffrey Halley) covering: GBP/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CHF, AUD/USD.
