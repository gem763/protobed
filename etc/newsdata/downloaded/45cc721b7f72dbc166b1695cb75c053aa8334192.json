I know what people think, who cares about hundreds of Isis fighters, but one of them is my son.'\n\nThe mother, who was speaking to the Guardian, fears the Syrian Democratic Forces could ask prisoners to fight for them against Turkey.\n\nThe Kurdish-led authority in northern Syria has called for a general mobilisation, urging residents to resist imminent Turkish attack.\n\nMrs Lane and her husband, organic farmer John Letts, were convicted at the Old Bailey in June of supporting terrorism by sending Jack \u00a3223 in 2015.\n\nJack Letts (pictured above) is one of several British people being held by the Kurds in Syria\n\nThey were also found not guilty for trying to wire him a further \u00a31,500 to pay a people smuggler to try to get him out. The couple received suspended sentences.\n\nMrs Lane has pleaded for Letts to be allowed to return and face trial in Britain so that he can be rescued from the conditions in which he is being held.\n\nBut the Home Office has dismissed her plea - and Muslim convert Letts, who left behind his middle-class life in Britain, has been stripped of his UK citizenship.\n\nPictures emerged over the weekend of Letts - who denies ever being a fighter - lying on the floor of a jail in Syria among dozens of fellow ISIS prisoners.\n\nLetts (right centre), who left his home in Oxfordshire to join ISIS in 2014, has been held in a squalid and overcrowded jail in northern Syria since Kurdish militia captured him in 2017\n\nAfter denouncing ISIS as 'un-Islamic' in social media posts, Letts managed to escape from the caliphate's capital Raqqa in May 2017.\n\nSince then he has been held by the Kurdish YPG militia at the prison in the photos - believed to be in the city of Qamishli. He has not been charged or put on trial.\n\nIn occasional letters to his parents sent via the Red Cross, Letts has described how he is being held in a mass cell, with almost no furniture.\n\nHe has said it is boiling in summer and freezing in winter, with no access to exercise or the outdoors, and little opportunity to wash.\n\nLetts is still a citizen of Canada, where his father comes from (pictured together as a child)\n\nIn one of his last acts as Home Secretary, Chancellor Sajid Javid revoked Letts's UK citizenship in July. Letts is still a citizen of Canada, where his father comes from.\n\nJohn Letts and Sally Lane leave the Old Bailey in London in June after they were spared jail\n\nMore than 60 British jihadis are languishing in Kurdish custody in northern Syria, their numbers equally split between men and women.\n\nThe male jihadis are being kept in secret prisons, while the women and children are being kept in camps such as Roj, Al-Hol and Ayn Issa.\n\nOfficials believe that some of the detainees are battle-hardened jihadis who would pose serious danger to national security, and have had their British citizenships withdrawn to prevent them from returning to the UK.\n\nThese include El-Shafee Elsheikh, 31, and Alexanda Kotey, 35, members of a gang of British terrorists known as the Beatles, who imprisoned, tortured and beheaded Western hostages.\n\nThe most infamous of the group was Mohammed Emwazi, also known as Jihadi John, who beheaded at least five Western hostages, including two Britons, in front of the camera.\n\nAmong female detainees are Shamima Begum, 19 - one of three Bethnal Green Academy girls who ran away to Syria in 2014.\n\nFormer Oxfam fundraising officer Mrs Lane is pictured with her son Letts, now 23, as a child\n\nShamima, who since gave birth to three children who have all died, is now in camp Roj in northern Syria.\n\nBegum, from Bethnal Green, East London, was first found by a British journalist earlier this year at the Al-Hol camp where she gave an interview saying she wants to come back to Britain. She has also been stripped of her citizenship.\n\nTooba Gondal, 25, fled IS's last stand in Baghouz, south-east Syria, and arrived at Ayn Issa camp in the north of the country in April.\n\nShe is staying at the camp with a son aged 18 months and a threeyear-old daughter.\n\nLast week, she issued a letter of apology to the people of Britain, pleading to come back to the UK.", "description": "Sally Lane, 57, who is the mother of Jack Letts, 23, of Oxford, fears the Syrian Democratic Forces could suddenly release Islamic State prisoners if the Turks enter territory held by Kurdish fighters.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline", "David Rose For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/12/19488162-0-image-a-45_1570620598161.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
