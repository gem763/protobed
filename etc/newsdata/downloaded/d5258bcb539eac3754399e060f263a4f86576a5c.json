Now [British Airways] is making billions of pounds of profit, its pilots have made a fair, reasonable and affordable claim for pay and benefits.\u201d\n\nPrince Harry is trying to make travel greener. We just can\u2019t figure out how.\n\nIn a post Monday, British Airways said it had no choice but to cancel nearly 100 percent of its flights because it had \u201cno detail from [the pilots\u2019 association] on which pilots would strike,\" so it could not predict \"how many would come to work or which aircraft they are qualified to fly.\u201d The carrier said it remained \u201cready and willing\u201d to return to talks with the pilots union.\n\nBritish Airways is offering all affected customers full refunds or the option to rebook to other travel days or other airlines. Customers were urged against coming to the airports and asked to make sure their contact information was up to date. Images of Heathrow and other airports showed eerily empty check-in lines. Other carriers associated with British Airways, including BA CityFlyer, Comair and Sun-Air were not affected.\n\nSalary is at the center of the fight between British Airways and its pilots. The carrier offered an 11.5 percent increase over three years. But pilots said they want a larger share of the airline\u2019s profit. The pilots union said that it offered a proposal to British Airways management earlier this month that could have prevented the two-day strike, but that negotiations quickly fell apart.\n\nWe put forward a proposal to BA management last Wednesday that would have enabled us to call off the strikes for Monday and Tuesday.\n\n\n\nBA didn't reply.#BAstrike https://t.co/xV8gWKYNwS\n\n\n\n(1/2) \u2014 BALPA (@BALPApilots) September 8, 2019\n\nStrutton said pilots have \u201ctaken big pay cuts to help the company through hard times,\u201d including in the years following the financial crisis. In a news release, the union said its argument is with the company\u2019s management and not with affected passengers.\n\nPassengers were in for a long flight delay. Then one of them stepped up to fly the plane.\n\nBritish Airways said other labor unions \u2014 constituting almost 90 percent of all company staff, including engineers, cabin crew and ground staff \u2014 had accepted the 11.5 percent increase. In addition to basic pay, pilots also receive annual pay increments and regular flying allowances. A company spokesperson told The Post that the average captain earns the equivalent of more than $206,000 per year, plus another almost $20,000 in flight allowances.\n\nThe carrier wasn\u2019t alone in criticizing the pilots \u2014 it was joined by stranded travelers bearing the brunt of the pilots\u2019 two-day walkout.\n\n\u201cDear #BritishAirways pilots. \u00a3100k + 11% is not only an eye-wateringly-good salary but is 3 x the average wage in this country. Many equally hard-working, highly skilled people survive on this and less,\u201d one Twitter poster said. \u201cOn your next flight please try to land here in the real world.\u201d\n\nDear #BritishAirways pilots. \u00a3100k + 11% is not only an eye-wateringly-good salary but is 3 x the average wage in this country.

On Monday, British Airways said it would contact passengers flying that day.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very sorry about the impact [the pilots union] action has had,\u201d the company wrote in its news release. \u201cWe don\u2019t underestimate the inconvenience caused, for which we are deeply sorry.\u201d", "description": "Nearly 200,000 passengers will be affected by the walkout rooted in a salary dispute.", "authors": ["Rachel Siegel", "National Business Reporter"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MILVRGWS7UI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
