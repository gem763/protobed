(Philip Montgomery)\n\nPresident Trump has fired his third national security adviser, John Bolton, a hawkish longtime politico with whom he constantly disagreed, despite having first taken to him on the basis of his Fox News appearances. Graeme Wood writes:\n\n\u201cHe is incredibly smart and capable,\u201d a Bolton acquaintance told me. \u201cHe could have risen faster if he had just been less of a dick.\u201d It\u2019s difficult to exaggerate how hard it is to earn a reputation as a dick in Washington. It\u2019s like being known as a real nerd by fellow scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, or as the resident prude by sisters at a nunnery. In Washington, boorishness can be a virtue, if the boor in question is on your side and gets things done \u2026 But Bolton is almost universally known for being off-putting and ill-tempered. \u201cOne of the world\u2019s cheapest people,\u201d says an ex-colleague. \u201cAn extremely unpleasant person,\u201d says another. Because Bolton\u2019s other signature quality is intelligence, former colleagues wonder how he abides his boss.\n\n\u2192 Read the rest of our April 2019 profile of Bolton\u2019s unusual ascent within the Trump administration.\n\n*\n\nSNAPSHOT\n\n(Christopher Aluka Berry / Reuters)\n\nJon Ossoff, the Democrat from Georgia who narrowly lost one of the most expensive House races in American history, announced he would enter the primary race to challenge Republican Senator David Perdue.\n\n*\n\n\u26c8 WEATHER ALERt\n\n(Jonathan Ernst / Reuters)\n\nApr\u00e8s NOAA, la d\u00e9luge: After President Trump\u2019s week-long insistence that Hurricane Dorian could have affected Alabama and Georgia, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross reportedly threatened National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials with firings unless they confirmed the president\u2019s initial claims. The escalation was an unprecedented step that could delegitimize one of the most reliable and free agencies in the federal government\u2014the National Weather Service, Robinson Meyer writes.
