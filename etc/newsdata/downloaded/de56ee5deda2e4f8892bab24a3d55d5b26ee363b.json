William Carvalho wrapped up the scoring in stoppage time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going through a good phase, but the team has been playing well too,\u201d Ronaldo said. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying this moment not only because of my goals, but also because of the team\u2019s performances in recent years. I just have to keep helping the team.\u201d\n\nIt was the second consecutive qualifying victory for Portugal after it opened Group B with two straight draws at home. It moved to second place with eight points, five fewer than leader Ukraine. Third-place Serbia, which won 3-1 at Luxembourg, has seven points.\n\nPortugal beat Serbia 4-2 on Saturday for its first qualifying win.\n\n\u201cWe did the hardest thing, which was to win at Serbia,\u201d Ronaldo said. \u201cIt was important to keep our momentum here. We are getting closer to our goal.\u201d\n\nPortugal, the defending European champion, dominated throughout in Vilnius, finishing with 31 total attempts.\n\nRonaldo, who now has 93 goals in 160 matches with Portugal, opened the scoring with a low shot from the penalty spot in the seventh minute after a handball by a Lithuanian defender following a cross by youngster Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix.\n\nThe hosts equalized with a header by Vytautas Andriuskevicius from a corner kick in the 28th, with the ball hitting the post before going in.\n\nRonaldo\u2019s second goal came with a low shot from outside the area that was initially saved by Lithuania goalkeeper Ernestas Setkus, but the ball bounced off the goalkeeper\u2019s back and went backward into the goal in the 62nd.\n\nRonaldo deflected in a cross by Bernardo Silva three minutes later, then added his fourth with a well-placed shot from inside the area in the 76th before being substituted and applauded by most of the local crowd.\n\nCarvalho scored from close range in the final minutes.\n\nLithuania was hosting Portugal for the first time. The match was played on artificial turf at the 5,000-capacity LFF Stadium.\n\nOn Oct. 11, Portugal hosts Luxembourg, while Lithuania visits Ukraine.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Cristiano Ronaldo scored four goals in Portugal's 5-1 win over last-place Lithuania in qualifying for the 2020 European Championship on Tuesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/lithuania_portugal_euro_2020_soccer_91791_c0-201-5340-3314_s1770x1032.jpg?8bbcc12173763c2e221a48296d888743115def52", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
