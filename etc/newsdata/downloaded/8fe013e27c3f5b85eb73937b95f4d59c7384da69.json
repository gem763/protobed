Rachel notes that Chandler carries a briefcase. This clue does not help. They look at each other, panicking.\n\n\u201cTen seconds,\u201d Ross says. \u201cYou need this or you lose the game.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s, um ... it has something to do with transponding!\u201d Monica, frantic, shouts. \u201cOh, oh, oh!\u201d Rachel agrees. \u201cOh, he\u2019s a transpons\u2014a transponster!\u201d\n\nThat, Monica squeals in agony, is not even a word. And it is definitely not Chandler Bing\u2019s job. Monica and Rachel lose the game\u2014and with it, their beloved apartment.\n\nTransponster was a punch line that had been, by Friends\u2019 fourth season, years in the making\u2014one of the jokes the show had been running pretty much since it made its premiere in September 1994. No one knows how Chandler Bing makes his living. That includes, quite often, Chandler himself. The women may have correctly answered several of the quiz\u2019s deep-cut questions about the guys\u2019 childhoods and sexual experiences and personal idiosyncrasies, but there\u2019s an aptness to the fact that, when it comes to Chandler, they are unable to answer a question so basic that it doubles, at this point, as a clich\u00e9: What does he do?\n\nEach episode of Friends engages in a cheerful act of bait and switch. The initial bars of the show\u2019s ear-wormy theme song\u2014So no one told you life was gonna be this way\u2014suggest a certain disillusionment to come, a sitcom whose situations might poke fun not only at life\u2019s absurdities, but also at its disappointments. In 1994, in particular, those lines suggested that Friends might be a comedic rendering of Reality Bites, the Generation X touchstone that had premiered earlier that year\u2014a story about young people attempting to eke some purpose out of a world that has given them none.\n\nFriends\u2019 characters, in those early days, occasionally dressed in flannel; beyond that, though, the show offered extremely little overlap with the film. Friends was too enamored of its premises\u2014New York and youth and all the magic that might be found in the mingling of the two\u2014to deliver on its own implied pessimisms. The show emphasized the giddy possibilities of the stage of life that, when Friends premiered, was about to be given its own designation: emerging adulthood. And so Friends, a family sitcom that celebrated the family you choose, was built not of betrayals, but of accommodations. The cynicisms of the world surrounding it were washed away in the upbeat chorus that doubled as the show\u2019s true refrain: I\u2019ll be there for you \u2026 \u2019cause you\u2019re there for me, too.\n\nThat optimism was evident from the very beginning in the array of professions that Friends allotted to its core characters. The show\u2019s small universe is populated by a chef and an actor and a musician and an academic and a fashion executive\u2014by people, in other words, whose jobs suggest the use of creative as a noun, and whose constellation of privileges includes the breezy ability to associate labor with spiritual fulfillment. Friends cared deeply, in its earnestly sardonic way, about the careers it had bequeathed to its protagonists. Its plots nourished and complicated and questioned the friends\u2019 jobs with an intensity that would anticipate other NBC shows\u2014among them 2005\u2019s The Office and 2009\u2019s Parks and Recreation\u2014and that would embrace extremely 21st-century assumptions about professions that double as identities. This was one of the fantasies Friends was selling: The show created a world whose denizens were able to take advantage of their work, rather than the other way around.", "description": "Twenty-five years ago, Friends anticipated a time that would both romanticize and mistrust the culture of work.", "authors": ["Megan Garber"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/Chandler_FINAL/facebook.jpg?1568303395", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
