Kim Jong-un's regime launched a ballistic missile off of its coast last week.\n\nThe KCNA's propaganda-heavy coverage suggests that almost any statement that differs from the Pyongyang line would be considered fake news. An article on Wednesday about Korean War commemorations south of the border thundered that \u201cthe South Korean authorities' rhetoric about reconciliation and peace only prove that they are false trumpeting to cover up their dark intention of escalating confrontation\u201d.\n\nStudents dance on Tuesday to mark the anniversary of Kim Jong-il's election as general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea Credit: Kim Won Jin/AFP via Getty More\n\nFour of the 10 \u201ctop news\u201d items on the KCNA website were stories about Kim receiving gifts, greetings and floral baskets on the 74th anniversary of the Workers' Party of Korea.\n\nRussian state media similarly accuses the West often of hypocrisy and hostile plots. After the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17 by a Russian missile in eastern Ukraine, state media deflected blame with a raft of wild conspiracy theories, and they portrayed the Salisbury poisoning accusations as a groundless \u201cprovocation\u201d against Moscow.\n\nOnly Turkmenistan ranked lower than North Korea in the Reporters Without Borders 2019 press freedom index, while Russia came in at 149.\n\nWhile AP and AFP have Pyongyang bureaus, government minders severely limit their reporters' movements and contacts. An Australian student who had posted photographs and written articles about the North Korean food and culture was expelled from the country in June on spying accusations.\n\nTASS, which has been granted two written interviews with Kim Jong-un, said on Wednesday it hopes to expand its bureau in the country to include a photography desk.\n\nThe Russian delegation also attended a \u201cCountry of the People\u201d patriotic gymnastics show performed by 30,000 North Koreans and were informed by top officials that Pyongyang fully supported Vladimir Putin's \u201cpolicies for defending the sovereignty of Russia\u201d.\n\nVladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un toast during the first meeting in Vladivostok in April Credit: Alexei Nikolsky/Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP More", "description": "North Korea and Russian state media have\u00a0joined forces to fight \u201cfake news\u201d about topics including Pyongyang's contentious relationship with Washington.
