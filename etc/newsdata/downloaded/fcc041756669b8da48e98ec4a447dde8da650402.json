Brewer III, an attorney for the NRA, said in a statement.\n\nSenate Republicans also rebuked the Democrats\u2019 report.\n\nThe NRA did not return FOX Business\u2019 request for comment regarding calls for investigation into its tax-exempt status.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nA spokesperson for the IRS did not return FOX Business\u2019 request for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, on Tuesday the NRA won a legal battle against the city of San Francisco over its effort to declare the group a domestic terrorist organization.
