Places with some atmosphere, places you\u2019d never find anywhere else.\n\nAnd hey \u2014 what should we drink?", "description": "Every bar should have a \u201cthing.\u201d My very favourite bar, Burp Castle in the East Village of Manhattan, is themed like a monastery; the bartenders wear monks\u2019 robes and gently shush the patrons to keep the noise down.
