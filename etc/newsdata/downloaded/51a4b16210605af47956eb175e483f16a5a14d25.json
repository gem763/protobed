Air Canada courts woke police with gender-neutral welcome that is... EVERYONE?", "language": "en", "text": "Addressing passengers as \u2018ladies and gentlemen\u2019 is discriminatory against those who don\u2019t identify as either, so let\u2019s just call them \u2018everybody,\u2019 Air Canada has decided. So no more gentlefolk on board.\n\nEmployees of the top Canadian airline were instructed to drop the long-time tradition of calling their passengers \u201cladies and gentlemen\u201d (or \u201cmesdames et messieurs\u201d when speaking French). Instead, passengers will be addressed as \u201ceverybody\u201d and \u201ctout le monde,\u201d local media reported.\n\nThe reason, of course, is that some people have more complex attitudes to their gender than the majority of humanity, and presumably feel excluded when they hear the greeting \u201cladies and gentlemen.\u201d After all, Air Canada was named the nation\u2019s Best Diversity Employers for 2019 and it has to fulfill its reputation as such.\n\n\u201cWe work hard to make sure all employees feel like valued members of the Air Canada family, while ensuring our customers are comfortable and respected when they choose to travel with us,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nThe move follows an earlier decision to allow passengers to put an \u201cX\u201d instead of \u201cM\u201d or \u201cF\u201d when booking tickets. The new rules were introduced \u201cto ensure an inclusive space for everyone, including those who identify with gender X,\u201d Air Canada said.\n\nAlso on rt.com Meet the black, transgender Cinderella\u2019s godmother you\u2019ve all been waiting for (or so the woke media tells us)\n\nWell, it\u2019s always good to make people more comfortable and accepted, although some inclusiveness advocates may find it too mild a move. After all, there are supposedly six genders for people to choose from \u2013 or 58, or over 100, depending who you ask \u2013 and only three possible letters on the form.\n\nAir Canada was definitely sensible in choosing \u201ceverybody\u201d instead of extending the binary list of honorifics, as they may have faced a backlash for not being inclusive enough. Hopefully nobody gets offended with the new, less polite address.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
