(Farina Hassan/Twitter, Eleanor Hayward/Facebook, Cole Burston/CP, Sean Kilpatrick/CP)\n\nHere are the four Milton voters who joined the conversation:\n\nBilal Arif, a University of Toronto mathematics student, is planning to vote for NDP candidate Farina Hassan. He likes their climate change platform, is impressed with party leader Jagmeet Singh and feels the New Democrats \"care about people in general.\"\n\nSean James is an eco-landscaper and says the Green Party's Eleanor Hayward has his vote. He likes their platform in general, beyond just their environmental policies, and said that he's \"tired of voting strategically.\"\n\nDoreen Clarke is a retired financial planner and says she will be casting her ballot for van Koeverden. While she believes the Liberals need to \"rein it in a little\" from a fiscal perspective, she's been impressed by a lot of what they have done in government over the last four years, and particularly agrees with their immigration policies.\n\nMayurkumar Dave is a small business owner. He's planning to vote for Raitt, because he says he trusts her long track record in office, and he likes the Conservatives' policies on business and immigration.\n\nWritten by Allie Jaynes.
