President Trump sure does.", "language": "en", "text": "AD\n\n\u201cThen you have the case of this wiseguy, Jussie Smollett, who beat up himself,\u201d Trump said Monday, referring to the controversy surrounding the Hollywood actor during a speech to the annual conference of International Association of Chiefs of Police in Chicago. \u201cAnd he said MAGA country did it, MAGA country. Okay?\u201d Trump said, referring to his \u201cMake American great again\u201d slogan. \u201cHe said MAGA \u2014 it\u2019s a hate crime. That\u2019s a hate crime. And it\u2019s a scam.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe then made an abrupt rhetorical pivot: \u201cIt\u2019s a real big scam, just like the impeachment of your president is a scam.\u201d\n\nThree days earlier, Trump again found a convenient link to impeachment during remarks on criminal justice at a historically black college.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll never let up on our efforts to ensure that our justice system is fair for every single American,\u201d he said Friday at Benedict College in South Carolina, before invoking his own case. \u201cAnd I have my own experience, you know that. You see what\u2019s going on with the witch hunt.\u201d\n\nTrump has spoken extensively about the Democrat-led impeachment process during meetings with world leaders and worked \u201cwitch hunt\u201d references into speeches about shale gas. From Cabinet meetings to gaggles with reporters on the South Lawn, Trump\u2019s fixation on impeachment has become a dominant feature of his presidency. Among hundreds of tweets about impeachment, Trump has awaked asking \u201cWhere\u2019s the whistleblower?\u201d and stayed up after midnight complaining about the \u201cThe Democrats Scam.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDuring a meeting with Finland\u2019s president this month, a Finnish reporter asked Trump what he could learn from \u201cthe happiest country in the world.\u201d Trump gave an answer about impeachment.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWell, you got rid of Pelosi, and you got rid of shifty Schiff,\u201d Trump said, referring to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Intelligence Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.).\n\nTrump\u2019s repeated references to his impeachment even as he carries out the duties of his office highlight how the president is seeking to turn his greatest political threat into a reelection rallying cry, said Barbara Perry, a presidential historian at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center of Public Affairs.\n\n\u201cIf he had his choice, he probably wouldn\u2019t want to be impeached,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now that it\u2019s happening and it\u2019s moving toward his probable impeachment, he\u2019s thinking, \u2018Why not make lemons out of lemonade?\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPresidents Bill Clinton and Richard M. Nixon faced impeachment by redoubling their focus on the tasks of the presidency, seeking to show that they would continue to uphold their responsibilities to the public despite the intensifying probes from Congress.\n\n\u201cLet others wallow in Watergate,\u201d Nixon said from the Rose Garden in 1973. \u201cWe are going to do our job.\u201d\n\nTrump has been content to dwell on the scandal underlying his impeachment, regularly making unprompted references to his dealings with Ukraine and Democrats who have accused him of abusing his office for political benefit.\n\nDuring a Cabinet meeting last week, Trump spoke extemporaneously about the economy, trade and foreign policy before launching into an extended soliloquy about impeachment.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSo we have a lot of good things going over there, and they\u2019re going very well,\u201d Trump said after discussing his policy in Syria. \u201cAs far as the continuation of the witch hunt, we beat the Russian deal. We beat the Mueller deal,\u201d referring to former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.\n\nAD\n\nHe then went on to decry the \u201cphony investigation\u201d and the Constitution\u2019s \u201cphony emoluments clause,\u201d urging Republican lawmakers to \u201cget tougher and fight\u201d on his behalf.\n\nThe Cabinet meeting was billed as a discussion of deregulation, but Trump ultimately took questions for several minutes, largely about impeachment.\n\nWhile Trump has used impeachment as a rallying cry for his base, he has occasionally complained that it is distracting him from the duties of his office.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe president of the United States should be allowed to run the country, not have to focus on this kind of crap, while at the same time doing a great job with Syria and Turkey and all of the other things that we\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump said during the Cabinet meeting last week.\n\nBut it\u2019s a distraction the president has embraced, making fighting back against impeachment an integral part of his daily public schedule.\n\nAD\n\nHe has tweeted more than 250 times over the past two weeks about impeachment, decrying the process as a \u201cscam,\u201d a \u201choax\u201d and \u201ctotally illegal & absurd.\u201d Trump has occasionally undermined Republican lawmakers with tweets likening impeachment to \u201ca lynching\u201d and calling for the identity of the whistleblower whose complaint kicked off Democrats\u2019 investigation.\n\nAD\n\nWhile flying on Air Force One to attend a shale gas conference in Pittsburgh last week, Trump tweeted that some of the administration officials testifying in the impeachment inquiry were \u201chuman scum.\u201d During the motorcade ride to the venue, he tweeted about \u201cNever Trumper Diplomat Bill Taylor,\u201d who had testified that Trump had pursued an improper quid pro quo linking military aid to Ukraine with political investigations.\n\nDuring his speech about energy to the conference, Trump introduced some members of Congress in attendance and then shifted to talking about how they defended him from impeachment. He later complained to conference attendees that some Republicans, including Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, were not sufficiently loyal.\n\n\u201cI have witch hunts every week,\u201d he said. \u201cI say, what\u2019s the witch hunt this week?\u201d\n\nIn some cases, impeachment has followed Trump even when he didn\u2019t bring it up. At the World Series game in Washington on Sunday, fans greeted Trump with boos and chants of \u201cLock him up.\u201d At one point, a banner reading \u201cImpeach Trump\u201d hung from the rafters.\n\nAD", "description": "Numerous times during the past month, Trump has gone off script to opine on impeachment during prepared remarks on unrelated topics or in response to questions not having to do with the Democrats\u2019 inquiry.", "authors": ["Toluse Olorunnipa", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3D4SLl8AeAW5Ube0_s_dQ6ClnH8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SID7KBHXJAI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
