Unusually, the House of Commons will continue to sit during the four-day event, after MPs rejected the PM\u2019s plea for a recess.\n\nAs a consequence, ministers will have to shuttle to and from London and opposition parties may take the opportunity to ambush the government, with the SNP calling for a vote of no confidence to instal an interim \u201cunity government\u201d while Tory MPs are away from Westminster.\n\nMr Johnson is under pressure over his conduct as mayor after he was referred to the police complaints body to assess whether he should face a criminal investigation over his links with American businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I\u2019m hoping that\u2019s not the case.\u201d\n\nCalling on Mr Johnson to use the conference to show the party is \u201cbroad and inclusive\u201d, Mr Benyon said: \u201cIt\u2019s clearly the last conference before the election, so the message they send out is absolutely vital. All the work we did to reach out to groups who were no longer supporting the Conservatives pre-2005 could be thrown away. We can\u2019t win elections appealing to just one sector of the population.\u201d\n\nAberconwy MP Guto Bebb said it may already be too late for the Conservatives to recover their reputation among mainstream voters for whom Brexit is not the dominant issue.\n\n\u201cOver a number of years, the Conservative party has been hollowed out, the number of members is falling and the sensible people have walked away,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sad to say that what I think we will see is that the Conservative party is in terminal decline.\u201d\n\nThe former defence minister \u2013 who has announced he will not fight the next election \u2013 said he expected the conference, and Mr Johnson\u2019s all-important keynote address, make Theresa May\u2019s 2016 assault on the \u201ccitizens of nowhere\u201d look like \u201ca model of restraint\u201d.\n\n\u201cI suspect the main thing we will see is the Conservative party continuing in the direction of becoming a new Brexit Party. I think it is their plan to whip up further division. I think the reputation of the Conservative party was trashed the moment they decided to endorse Boris Johnson as leader by such a margin.\n\n\u201cThey have taken a decision which may deliver an election victory this year but in the long term means the party turning away from the pragmatic middle-of-the-road voters who would once have given them the benefit of the doubt because of their offer of economic competence and stability. These voters will be alienated by the ideological pursuit of Brexit by radicals and people with no stake in society.\u201d\n\nFormer cabinet minister Justine Greening said it was vital for Mr Johnson to spell out in detail to activists the Brexit deal which he hopes to obtain from Brussels.\n\n\u201cConservative activists deserve to see what Boris Johnson\u2019s detailed Brexit plan is,\u201d Ms Greening told The Independent.\n\n\u201cHe sold Britain Brexit alongside Michael Gove, now they\u2019re in charge and Mr Johnson is prime minister, so what\u2019s his plan?\n\n\u201cTheresa May published a detailed white paper, though it was the worst of all worlds on Brexit. Even if they disagreed with it, at least people knew what she wanted.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson has been warned that he risks sending the Conservatives into \u201cterminal decline\u201d if he allows this week\u2019s party conference to become a rally for the hardest form of no-deal Brexit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/28/19/johnson-tory-conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
