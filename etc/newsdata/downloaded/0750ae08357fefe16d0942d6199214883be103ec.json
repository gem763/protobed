No more, no less. With Justice Antonin Scalia as the leading advocate for this project, they\u2019ve succeeded, convincing even liberal jurists that textualism in the interpretation of statutes is the way to go.\n\nOn Tuesday, as the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a trio of cases grappling with whether federal employment law already protects gay and transgender workers from discrimination in the workplace, Justice Elena Kagan summarized the success of Scalia\u2019s enterprise. \u201cFor many years,\u201d she said from the bench, \u201cthe lodestar of this Court\u2019s statutory interpretation has been the text of a statute, not the legislative history, and certainly not the subsequent legislative history.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time Kagan has endorsed textualism. But with the Trump administration all but abandoning textualist arguments in arguing that Congress never intended the words \u201cbecause \u2026 of sex\u201d in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to encompass workplace discrimination against LGBTQ employees, she may have felt the need to remind everyone where she and most of her colleagues stood nowadays. \u201cDid you discriminate against somebody \u2026 because of sex? Yes, you did. Because you fired the person because this was a man who loved other men,\u201d Kagan said during the first of the morning\u2019s two hearings, and then added: \u201cIf he were a woman, he wouldn\u2019t have been fired.\u201d\n\nThen came this little lecture: \u201cThis is the usual kind of way in which we interpret statutes now. We look to laws. We don\u2019t look to predictions. We don\u2019t look to desires. We don\u2019t look to wishes. We look to laws.\u201d Scalia, Kagan\u2019s erstwhile hunting partner, would\u2019ve been proud.\n\nBy now, there\u2019s little doubt that the looming decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, Altitude Express v. Zarda, and R.R. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes v. EEOC, the three cases the Supreme Court considered over the course of two hours on Tuesday, will be a landmark for gay rights. Until last year, when Justice Anthony Kennedy retired, in effect surrendering his seat and legacy to Donald Trump, those rights appeared secure, yet amenable to a raft of religious challenges that the Supreme Court nonetheless seemed in no rush to settle. No more: Neither Scalia\u2019s replacement, Justice Neil Gorsuch, nor Kennedy\u2019s, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, are the centrist pragmatists that prior Republican appointees strived to be. They\u2019re culture warriors in the mold of Justice Samuel Alito, who has worried publicly about morality and religion being under siege in the United States, and who on Tuesday expressed concern about \u201cwhat some people will say\u201d if the nation\u2019s highest court were to rule that a civil-rights statute enacted more than 50 years ago were now read to encompass job protections for gay and transgender workers.\n\nAlito couldn\u2019t help but answer his own question: \u201cWhat they will say is that whether Title VII should prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a big policy issue, and it is a different policy issue from the one that Congress thought it was addressing 1964.\u201d He added that reading that into the law, which lawmakers have declined to amend to cover this kind of discrimination, would be akin to \u201cacting exactly like a legislature.\u201d Alito is correct to note that Congresses past have tried but failed to update Title VII to explicitly bar employers from taking adverse employment actions against LGBTQ workers. This past May, the Democratic-led House passed a sweeping bill that not only would do that, if signed into law, but would also overhaul other federal anti-discrimination laws. The bill is now sitting in committee, and probably will until the Senate changes hands.\n\nBut if you\u2019re a real textualist, all of that is beside the point. As Pamela Karlan, the lawyer for the two gay men at the center of the first half of Tuesday\u2019s session, put it in her straightforward first few minutes at the podium, Title VII as it exists today resolves the case:\n\nWhen an employer fires a male employee for dating men but does not fire female employees who date men, he violates Title VII. The employer has, in the words of Section 703(a), discriminated against the man because he treats that man worse than women who want to do the same thing. And that discrimination is because of sex, again in the words of Section 703(a), because the adverse employment action is based on the male employee\u2019s failure to conform to a particular expectation about how men should behave; namely, that men should be attracted only to women and not to men.\n\nKarlan\u2019s first few minutes at the podium were so assertive and to the point, she even left the justices speechless for a few seconds. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, herself an early proponent of a slow and incremental understanding of gender equality under the law, asked Karlan to describe why discrimination against gays and lesbians \u201ccould not have been in Congress\u2019s mind\u201d at a time when many states outlawed same-sex relationships and homosexuality was considered a mental illness by American Psychiatric Association. Karlan responded: \u201cIn 1964, those were the days of Mad Men, so the idea that sexual orientation would have been reached \u2014 most courts didn\u2019t find sexual harassment to be actionable until this Court did.\u201d\n\nIndeed, there\u2019s no evidence that the Congress that approved the 1964 law ever had considered sexual harassment of the Me Too kind to be a form of sex discrimination at the moment of passage. It took advocates and social movements beginning in the 1970s to convince American courts, including the Supreme Court, that that was the case. The same goes for declaring unlawful sex stereotypes about how women should dress and behave, or that Title VII covers \u201cseverely hostile or abusive\u201d harassment by men against another man for not carrying himself like society expects him to. \u201cThe critical issue, Title VII\u2019s text indicates, is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed,\u201d Scalia once wrote in a ruling that\u2019s critical to the plaintiffs in these cases.\n\nYet this jurisprudential history didn\u2019t seem to carry much persuasive force with some of the more conservative justices on Tuesday. Instead, there were concerns about bathroom usage, \u201cmassive social upheaval,\u201d and what would happen to \u201cjudicial modesty,\u201d as Gorsuch put it, if the Supreme Court were to find that LGBTQ workers are somehow protected by existing federal law. Not to be left behind, a lawyer for the Trump administration, which tried unsuccessfully to reverse a years-long position by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on these issues, also sounded the alarm, as if to dare the justices to not go where lawmakers haven\u2019t. \u201cI actually find it troubling for courts to take that approach because I actually think it deprives the people of the ability to struggle with these issues democratically,\u201d Noel Francisco, the Justice Department\u2019s solicitor general, said.\n\nThose were precisely the worries voiced at the time the Supreme Court settled, for the entire nation, marriage equality once and for all. The sky didn\u2019t fall \u2014 there may still be open questions about wedding cakes and photographers and other religious objections, but the country has more or less adjusted to the new reality. Neither did the sky fall when Congress, several decades ago, imposed on employers and businesses, even those southern establishments that once claimed religion gave them a right to discriminate, an obligation to treat everyone equally. Begrudgingly or not, everyone adjusted.\n\nThe question, then, becomes whether the Supreme Court is ready to declare what the law is with the text that\u2019s in front of it. If it does, and there\u2019s a backlash, as there has been in this same area of the law, there\u2019s a solution. \u201cInterpreting a statute is not depriving the democratic process,\u201d the ACLU\u2019s David Cole, who represented transgender worker Aimee Stephens, told the justices on Tuesday. \u201cIt is doing what the Court is supposed to do within the democratic process, and of course if the democratic process disagrees with the Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute, it can change it.\u201d", "description": "On Tuesday, as the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a trio of cases grappling with whether federal employment law already protects gay and transgender workers.
