Mitchell ended up in prison. It\u2019s all unraveling.\u201d\n\nWhat could one document hold to generate so much huff?\n\nIn short, the complaint is a record of a months-long attempt by Trump to extract from Ukraine two silver bullets, one that would \u201cprove\u201d his opponents cheated in the last election, and one that would win him the next election.\n\nIf that seems like a lot to hope for from Ukraine \u2013 if the plan seems a bit implausible, wild even \u2013 no one, of any political stripe, can be heard at the moment to be saying that it was a good plan.\n\nBut the complaint indicates with damning detail that that was indeed the plan; that Trump went a long way toward carrying it out; that he was helped in his scheme by his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as well as by lawyers and officials in the White House and apparently in the departments of justice and state allegedly including Barr; and that the Ukrainians had begun to try to understand what silver bullets Trump wanted and where they could get them, so as not to risk missing out on US aid worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThrough a spokesperson, Barr has denied involvement. Speaking on Fox News, Giuliani has enthusiastically detailed his involvement, but said he was working at the behest of the state department, which the state department has denied.\n\nWhat appears to have so alarmed career government ethics and oversight officials, however, is the extent to which the now released complaint reveals that Trump\u2019s ethical rot, as they perceive it, has spread beyond the Oval Office, beyond the White House, beyond the cabinet and through the government.\n\nA section of the whistleblower document.

The complaint indicates that that same arrangement is still in effect, only now the deals have to do with Trump\u2019s political enemies, and the safe is the one they usually use to keep records for things like flying five helicopters into Pakistan at midnight.\n\nThe overriding sense is there were a lot of people involved in a scheme by the president to both tamper in an upcoming election and to prosecute political opponents, with the help of a foreign government, secured in part by holding up hundreds of millions of dollars in aid previously appropriated by Congress.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint says it is based on the account of \u201cmore than half a dozen US officials\u201d. In accurately describing the contents of a 25 July phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president \u2013 though the whistleblower was not on the call \u2013 the complaint says \u201capproximately a dozen White House officials\u201d and at least one state department official listened to the call. After that, \u201cmultiple\u201d state department and intelligence officials were briefed on the call, the complaint says.", "description": "Report indicates there were a lot of people involved in Trump\u2019s scheme to tamper in the 2020 election and prosecute opponents  * Trump-Ukraine whistleblower complaint: read it in full  Donald Trump at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Thursday.
