By the pool, of course, beneath blazing sunshine.\n\nBut, hold on. Today, I have already run four miles, stretched through two yoga classes and done so many burpees I lost count at 50. And I've never felt better.\n\nAround me are 18 women, all shapes and ages, with one goal \u2014 to get motivated and get fit \u2014 in the heavenly flower-filled grounds of Finca Monasterio, a converted 18th century monastery in south-east Spain, on a five-day fitness retreat.\n\nAt the Estelle Love Light retreat many of the fitness classes take place around Finca Monasterio's pool\n\nOur hosts are the best in the business.\n\nThere's Peter, or P Mac, a hunky PT an Instagram sensation who's trained everyone from your 70-year-old neighbour to singer Dua Lipa, and Estelle McCluskie \u2014 the most inspiring yoga instructor you could hope to meet.\n\nOur day starts at 6.30am with that run. It's amazing how far you can go when you swap people-clogged pavements for empty country roads lined with fields of lavender.\n\nThe surrounding gardens are a good place for yoga classes or taking a break\n\nIt's followed by a 30-minute hot HIIT session by the pool \u2014 a blur of lunges and press-ups \u2014 before a day of yoga , ab and glute classes.\n\nEach evening we have a big group meal at a communal table. Food is sensational \u2014 huge platters of couscous or chickpea salads, barbecued chicken and watermelon to follow. And despite all the exercise, I never feel deprived.\n\nNor do my new friends. While we came here as strangers, we leave as a group of women who've encouraged each other, laughed together and, believe it or not, relaxed. I feel revived and inspired.", "description": "Estelle Love Light hosts fitness retreats in the grounds of an 18th-century converted monastery in Spain.
