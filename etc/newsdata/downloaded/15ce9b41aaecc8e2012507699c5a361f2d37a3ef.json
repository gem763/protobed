Mandatory Credit: Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIn a YouTube video blog published Friday, the Panthers\u2019 longtime starting quarterback revealed he has a mild Lisfranc sprain on his left foot, an injury he says he suffered in the team\u2019s third preseason game against the New England Patriots last month.\n\nAccompanied by a cigar and a glass of wine, the three-time Pro Bowler and 2015 NFL MVP admitted that he did not inform head coach Ron Rivera or the team that he was injured \u2014 even when he realized warming up before the season opener against the Los Angeles Rams that he was not himself.\n\n\u201cI was hiding an injury where I could have easily said, \u2018You know what, Coach, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready. Maybe I need to kind of consider sitting this one out for the betterment [of the team],\u2019\u201d Newton said, adding that he told some on the coaching staff that he was fine even after they asked if was healthy.\n\nReasoning that he stayed silent partially because of his \u201cSuperman\u201d persona, Newton said he \u201cgot in my own way. Because, automatically, I thought, \u2018I\u2019ve got to play Week 1. I can\u2019t let my fans down. I\u2019ve got to be there for my team.\u2019\u201d\n\nNewton, already coming off an offseason shoulder surgery on his throwing arm, did not look like himself as the Panthers dropped their first two games against the Rams and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Newton said he finally told Rivera after he couldn\u2019t push off his foot to attempt a potential game-winning touchdown on 4th-and-1 at the Tampa 2-yard line in the waning seconds \u2014 with Carolina instead direct-snapping to Christian McCaffrey.\n\nNFL Network reported Tuesday that backup Kyle Allen is likely to be the starter for several weeks. Allen threw four touchdown passes and led the Panthers to their first win of the 2019 season in Week 3 at Arizona.\n\nIn the season\u2019s first two games, Newton has completed 56.2 percent of his passes for 572 yards. In 89 pass attempts, he has not thrown a touchdown pass and has one interception.\n\nNewton has two years remaining on his five-year contract extension. The 30-year-old is owed more than $21 million, including a $2 million option bonus, for the 2020 season.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "In his first public comments since being sidelined, Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton confirmed he has a Lisfranc injury that he says he kept secret from his own team.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434795835&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R05H-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
