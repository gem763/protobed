The S&P 500 gained 0.19% to close at 3,010.29. The Nasdaq Composite advanced by 0.81% to 8,185.80. A mixed bag of corporate earnings led to a directionless session for the major indexes.\n\n3M rains down on Microsoft's parade\n\nShares of 3M fell more than 4% after the company cut its full-year earnings guidance. The stock's losses pressured the Dow for most of the session and outweighed positive results from Microsoft. The tech giant climbed nearly 2% after reporting earnings and revenue that topped analyst expectations. Microsoft's results were driven in part by strong sales from the company's cloud business. Wall Street digested these results \u2014 along with reports from Twitter, Tesla, and Dow Inc \u2014 during the busiest day of the earnings season.\n\nTwitter tumbles, Tesla surges\n\nTwitter's stock tumbled more than 20% on earnings that missed analyst expectations. The social media company said it faced product issues along with advertising \"headwinds\" during the previous quarter. Meanwhile, Tesla surged more than 17% after the electric car maker posted a surprise profit.\n\nWhat happens next?", "description": "A mixed bag of corporate earnings led to a directionless session for the major indexes.", "authors": ["Fred Imbert"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105556839-1541540183772gettyimages-1053299772.jpeg?v=1571945520", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
