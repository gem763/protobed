Publisher Zanichelli is highlighting 3,126 Italian words that it says are in danger of disappearing as they are used less and less used in writing, speaking and in the media.\n\nThe at-risk words are marked in the giant edition, which is intended to spark discussion among Italians over which words they would save. So far, choices have included \"idiosincrasia\" (idiosyncrasy), \"caspita\" (golly) and \"perdinci\" (by jingo!).\n\nThe dictionary began its journey in Turin and will make an appearance in Milan, Florence, Bologna, Bari and Palermo.", "description": "Words people have declared they would save include 'caspita' (golly) and 'perdinci' (by jingo).", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/47/08/1000x563_cmsv2_612542c9-827c-5db6-a070-15d0e67945d8-4204708.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
