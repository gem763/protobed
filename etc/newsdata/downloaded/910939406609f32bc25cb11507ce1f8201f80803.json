I could totally do that,\u201d she says, not at all out of breath, before running backstage to give out hugs and motivational speeches.\n\n\u201cI am fa-reaked out! Y\u2019all look so beautiful!\u201d Dawson tells her runway walkers: kids, grandmas, actual models, friends and bare-chested female dancers in gold body paint. All around Dawson and Studio 189 co-founder Abrima Eriwah is a rainbow of skin tones and gender identities and jubilant patterned fabrics reflecting the collection\u2019s inspiration: They called it \u201cHeritage\u201d to mark the 400th anniversary of the first slave ships departing Africa for Virginia.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWere Dawson a politician instead of a longtime activist who\u2019s dating a guy who\u2019s running for president, these would be her constituents. She\u2019s doing the Elizabeth Warren selfie line, except she\u2019s the one who wants pictures with everyone.\n\nFantasia was there, along with Jay-Z protegee Young Paris, Black Lives Matter co-founder Opal Tometi, and a packed house of some 800 people. But not Sen. Cory Booker, or \u201cnoted boyfriend of Rosario Dawson,\u201d as New York magazine\u2019s feminist website the Cut likes to call him.\n\nTheir first anniversary was Oct. 14, and the year has been a mishmash of convoluted schedules. In September, the senator from New Jersey was prepping for the third Democratic debate in Houston during her fashion show. And by the time he took the debate stage, Dawson was already back in Albuquerque on the set of \u201cBriarpatch,\u201d the neo-noir anthology series for USA network that she stars in (as an investigator having an affair with a senator!) and which just wrapped a 3\u00bd -month shoot.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI laugh because it\u2019s like, \u2018Okay, you\u2019re flying and connecting through here. Maybe we can meet at the airport hotel,\u2019 \u201d Booker said in an interview last week, calling in from the campaign trail. \u201cIt has made for great adventures of, you know, making seven hours together be magical.\u201d\n\nDawson is also working on several social justice documentaries; voicing Wonder Woman in an animated feature; promoting the big-budget movie \u201cZombieland: Double Tap\u201d; and working as a board member for Voto Latino, the voting rights organization she co-founded with Mar\u00eda Teresa Kumar 15 years ago. Not to mention her personal obligations as a single mother of an adopted teenage daughter and the Hollywood success story in a big Puerto Rican family from New York\u2019s Lower East Side.\n\nAs recognizable as Dawson is \u2014 she\u2019s starred as Claire Temple in the Netflix Marvel universe and gets mobbed by fans \u2014 it is interest in her relationship with Booker that is currently dominating her story. He\u2019s the only unmarried Democratic presidential candidate and potentially the first modern bachelor president. She\u2019s the young Jane Fonda of the Afro-Latinx world (or, perhaps, labor leader Dolores Huerta if she\u2019d also starred in \u201cSin City\u201d and the movie version of \u201cRent\u201d). They are the rare power couple capable of fascinating political analysts, Hollywood gossips and your mother.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUntil now, they\u2019ve rarely been seen together in public. Instead, Booker has gushed about her on talk shows, and they drop little windows into their relationship on Dawson\u2019s Instagram, through cute videos or screenshots of text messages she posted of Booker\u2019s buddies congratulating him for having a girlfriend who was a clue in last Sunday\u2019s New York Times crossword puzzle.\n\nTuesday\u2019s debate in Ohio is the first Dawson has managed to attend. Booker arrived holding her hand. She stayed until the end, documenting it on Instagram. It seems to be part of a new phase of openness in their relationship.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in love! I am absolutely in love, and it is so exciting,\u201d Dawson said last month, while sitting barefoot in a gown on her hotel bed during a 24-hour trip to the Toronto Film Festival.\n\nAD\n\nBecause \u201cBriarpatch\u201d wrapped in late September, she\u2019s been home in Los Angeles and Booker has come to her. He kissed her on the red carpet of her \u201cZombieland: Double Tap\u201d premiere on Thursday.\n\nAD\n\nWhen the Daily Mail wrote in a headline that Dawson had joined her presidential candidate boyfriend at the premiere of the sustainable agriculture documentary \u201cThe Need to Grow,\u201d Booker corrected it on Twitter, \u201cActually, I joined her.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just lazy,\u201d Dawson says in a later phone call. \u201cLike, I narrate that movie and I\u2019m a producer on it.\u201d\n\nAll this togetherness, Dawson says, is just a function of her having some free time. But it certainly can\u2019t hurt Booker\u2019s flagging poll numbers; he\u2019s averaging 1.4 percent in national surveys.\n\nAD\n\nThere\u2019s an expectation for political partners to be quietly supportive in the background. There\u2019s no playbook for when a politician starts dating a vocal activist and Hollywood star who\u2019s as famous, if not more famous.\n\nDawson says she\u2019s planning to ride around Iowa in an RV next month with him. \u201cRV tours are my jam,\u201d she says. \u201cI think there\u2019s no way of making that happen without quote-unquote \u2018joining him on the campaign trail.\u2019 It\u2019s going to show up like that no matter what, but I\u2019m just trying to spend time with my boyfriend.\u201d\n\nFlash back to the 2016 election: Booker was a freshman senator who'd endorsed Hillary Clinton and was a possible VP pick. Dawson was a vocal Bernie Sanders surrogate, stumping for him around the country. She also got arrested in the \"Democracy Spring\" protests at the Capitol, calling for reform of voting laws and removing money from politics.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it would be for, but I could see myself getting arrested again in the near future, if that\u2019s what draws people\u2019s attention to something. For me, it\u2019s always on the table,\u201d says Dawson, who has said that running for office is on her bucket list.\n\nIndeed, Dawson was so far left in 2016 that many people believe that after Sanders lost the primary, she voted for Jill Stein. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t!\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s on my Wikipedia and it keeps getting proliferated, but it\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nShe was at the Democratic convention, she saw the infighting, she got sad, and mad. And she says she\u2019s still upset anyone would think she\u2019d do something to have put Donald Trump in office.\n\nAD\n\nDawson\u2019s mom, Isabel Celeste, also stumped for Sanders and says that when she first met Booker, she told him, \u201cYou know, you don\u2019t get my vote.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut after getting to know him, she\u2019s convinced: \u201cHe\u2019s young, he\u2019s hard-working, he\u2019s stoic, he\u2019s amazing, he\u2019s probably going to marry my daughter and shut the front door.\u201d\n\nIt seems as if Dawson and Booker, then, are a case of opposite Democrats attract. Some clickbait-y blind items have circulated on the Internet insinuating that their relationship is fake. If this were for show, honestly, she\u2019d be a little edgy for his presidential brand. Toward the left side of progressive. Has been arrested for social justice and expects to do it again.\n\nAD\n\nAnd then there\u2019s that celebratory video for her 40th birthday that she posted on Instagram this May of herself topless and outdoors, looking at palm trees as birds chirped in the background. She showed nothing but her back and confidence and excellent complexion, and yet she inspired a slew of incredulous responses on conservative media and Twitter wondering whether Cory Booker\u2019s \u201cactress girlfriend\u201d had gone nuts.\n\nAD\n\nThese two seem to take it in stride. She\u2019s 40. He\u2019s 50. They\u2019ve both lived public lives for a long time. \u201cI think that\u2019s actually pretty cool,\u201d says Dawson. \u201cI don\u2019t need to make that legitimate for anybody else.\u201d\n\nLike most couples who\u2019ve been together for a while, their origin story is evolving. Though Booker has said that Dawson didn\u2019t give him the time of day when they first met at a summer 2018 fundraiser for Ben Jealous, a mutual friend who was running for governor of Maryland, he tells it a little differently this time.\n\n\u201cThere was no love connection there,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it was the places of life we were in. I was probably dating somebody when we first met.\u201d\n\nDawson\u2019s last known boyfriend before dating Booker \u2014 the most earnest man in politics \u2014 was comedian Eric Andr\u00e9, perhaps best known for finding inventive ways to appear fully nude on his Adult Swim talk show.\n\nAD\n\nThen in October 2018, Dawson and Booker ran into each other again. \u201cI mean, gosh, that night we talked for hours and hours,\u201d says Booker. At the end of the night, he says, \u201cI had trouble asking for her phone number. . . . I think I said something really stupid like, \u2018Uh, how would I get in touch with you?\u2019 And she mercifully said something like, \u2018Oh, you want my phone number?\u2019 And my insides were like, \u2018Hell, yeah!\u2019 \u201d\n\nWas he really the dork he says he was?\n\n\u201cA million and one percent,\u201d says Dawson. \u201cHe\u2019s so charming and so confident and so capable, but it\u2019s not like that translates to being some super-smooth kind of guy. That\u2019s not his style. What wins me over with him is definitely the dad jokes.\u201d\n\nThey live on opposite coasts, but Booker says that almost immediately they started seeing each other once a week. The couple knew that Booker\u2019s schedule would become insane once he declared on Feb. 1 and that Dawson\u2019s would become immovable once she started \u201cBriarpatch.\u201d\n\nBut then Dawson\u2019s dad, Greg Dawson, got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at the beginning of the year, and she oriented all the time she could toward caring for him and flying back for his chemo appointments.\n\nRosario Dawson says that his tumor has shrunk dramatically and that she\u2019s both glad she was able to be his advocate and furious at how byzantine the health-care system is.\n\nHer 16-year-old daughter, Isa, meanwhile, spent most of the summer with her in New Mexico, which didn\u2019t leave a ton of time for Booker. Dawson says they went two months without seeing each other. But they\u2019ve made up for it with FaceTime, which they try to do twice a day. He\u2019s gotten in the habit of sending her music every morning, and he just finished reading David Benioff\u2019s World War II novel \u201cCity of Thieves\u201d to her over the phone. Dawson says he\u2019s the only partner she\u2019s ever spoken to every day, multiple times a day. They both enjoy pointing out that they are vegan.\n\nShe calls him CAB and forgets that he doesn\u2019t like it when she uses that around other people.\n\n\u201cNot everybody has good initials,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s my anchor. He\u2019s my guy, you know. He\u2019s very presumptuous. My initials are R-I-D. But he calls me RIB.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, both of us, you know, we\u2019ve had relationships,\u201d says Booker, \u201cbut I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve ever fully given myself over to a relationship as much as I have with her and allowed myself to be as vulnerable.\u201d\n\nDawson says that she was trying to explain to a younger cousin how you know you\u2019re in love, and she could only describe how she feels about Booker. \u201cFor my whole life, I\u2019ve always felt like, even when I got into a relationship, I was trying to be the center of the storm and everything was just this maelstrom out there,\u201d she says. \u201cBut for the first time, I feel like I have someone in the center of the storm with me.\u201d\n\nDawson was about 7 years old when she started marching with her family for housing rights, homelessness rights, women's rights, LGBTQI rights. Her mother, Isabel Celeste, would push Rosario and her younger brother Clay, who is now a writer and DJ, around in a shopping cart lined with pillows.\n\n\u201cI would have a staple gun and sticks and poster board,\u201d Isabel Celeste says, \u201cand they would have magic markers, and they would make banners for people, so they\u2019d have something to march with.\u201d Dawson\u2019s great-grandmother and grandmother marched in support of unionizing female garment workers.\n\nThey were a young family; Isabel Celeste was 17 when she had Rosario, who has no relationship with her biological father. When Rosario was little, her mother married Greg Dawson, a carpenter who raised her.\n\nLiving conditions grew unbearable in the only Lower East Side apartment they could afford, so they moved into an abandoned building around the corner that didn\u2019t have electricity or running water but at least was clean.\n\nGrowing up, Dawson was the performer of the family, according to her uncle Gustavo Vasquez, who is a comic-book artist: \u201cShe would dress up like Madonna did with the bows and patterns.\u201d And, he says, she seemed to absorb the creative energy of the artists who were also squatting in their building. Still, no one in the family had ever been in show business, and had she not been sitting on her stoop at age 15 at the exact time director Larry Clark and writer Harmony Korine walked by, Dawson wouldn\u2019t be, either.\n\nThey asked her to do a screen test, put her in their 1995 film, \u201cKids,\u201d about New York City youths grappling with HIV/AIDS, and her life changed. She still lived at home, though, even after Spike Lee cast her in \u201cHe Got Game.\u201d\n\nAs an actress, Dawson has always veered toward genre, whether it\u2019s because she grew up devouring comic books with her uncle Gus or because those are the roles she\u2019s offered. \u201cI\u2019ve had indie films where I\u2019ve either been the lead or a co-lead,\u201d she says. \u201cBut usually I\u2019m a co-star.\u201d\n\n\u201cBriarpatch,\u201d her USA show, which premieres in January, may be the meatiest role she\u2019s had. It\u2019s based on a hard-boiled crime novel from prolific author (and World War II veteran) Ross Thomas. Creepy hotel. Small-town Texas villains who turn out to be terrifying. Exploding cars. Zoo animals run amok. Alan Cumming.\n\nAnd at the center is Dawson\u2019s character, Allegra Dill, a woman from a Texas border town who comes home from Washington, D.C., to investigate her sister\u2019s murder. Allegra also happens to be having sex with her boss \u2014 a U.S. senator.\n\nAndy Greenwald, the well-known TV critic who adapted Thomas\u2019s book into the series and is the \u201cBriarpatch\u201d showrunner, says he couldn\u2019t believe it when he heard Dawson was interested in the role.\n\n\u201cI feel like people have been asking her to be the lead in a TV show for a decade,\u201d Greenwald says. \u201cAnd she said no every time.\u201d\n\nDawson has done an 18-episode guest arc on Jane the Virgin. But she\u2019s never had her own series. \u201cIt\u2019s the commitment,\u201d she says. Unlike most TV shows, \u201cBriarpatch\u201d is a 10-episode series like \u201cTrue Detective.\u201d\n\nBeing No. 1 on the call sheet is a huge responsibility, and Dawson did not take it lightly. The No. 1\u2019s mood can make or break everyone\u2019s experience on a production. Greenwald says Dawson made a point to be \u201crelentlessly optimistic and positive\u201d no matter what was going on with her daughter or her dad\u2019s cancer or Booker being so far away \u2014 though he did come to the set once, driving three hours out of his way while in New Mexico for a fundraiser.\n\nBack what seems like a lifetime ago, in Dawson's hotel room at the \"Briarpatch\" premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in September, Dawson grabbed a bottle of water and began adding an inky, green substance to it from a dropper.\n\n\u201cHave you had chlorophyll water?\u201d she asks. She\u2019d been using it to treat her altitude sickness in New Mexico. \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between me having migraines and then throwing up or me being able to sleep and function and actually have extra energy,\u201d she says.\n\nShe\u2019d been having a great time in Toronto. The news was getting her a little annoyed, though. She\u2019d told a reporter she wanted to work on voter registration vs. stumping for candidates this election, and suddenly there were articles saying she didn\u2019t endorse Booker. A month earlier Page Six had published its third article about how Booker\u2019s \u201cactress girlfriend\u201d wasn\u2019t attending his campaign events. (Dawson posted it to her Instagram with the caption, \u201cI made it!\u201d)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for me to maintain my own space and my own character and personality and career and professionalism,\u201d she says. No one\u2019s accusing Booker of being neglectful if he doesn\u2019t come to some of her events. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018I call B.S. on this.\u2019 I don\u2019t need to be on his arm to be supportive of him and vice versa.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth of us are feminists,\u201d Booker said in a later interview, \u201cand both of us find it a double standard that they don\u2019t ask me the same questions that they ask her. You know, I have an incredibly successful, self-made woman as my girlfriend who is managing a business, nonprofit work, a career. And when she has her big moments, nobody says, \u2018Hey, where\u2019s your boyfriend?\u2019 \u201d\n\nPlus, there\u2019d been reasons, even beyond work and time, that she\u2019d been laying low. She and Booker get harassed sometimes when they go out in public. Sometimes her daughter is with them. She\u2019s been in relationships with other actors before, but this is a level of intense scrutiny, coupled with fear, that she\u2019d never experienced before. A pipe bomb, she pointed out, had been intercepted on the way to Booker\u2019s New Jersey office last year.\n\nShe wants to find more meaningful acting projects, produce more documentaries, maybe go back to college and learn about \u201cregenerative farming and soil practices to capture carbon.\u201d She\u2019ll also continue to grow Voto Latino, which registered 200,000 voters last year and their leadership seminars have produced some elected officials.\n\nShe and Booker have talked about kids, and are seriously think about it. She adopted Isa at age 12, and together they\u2019ve grown. \u201cI feel very much like I checked the mom box in this lifetime.\u201d And as much as she loves babies, \u201cI don\u2019t know that I have to be the one to actually push them out.\u201d\n\nStill, she finds all the speculating she gets from strangers, and her mother, amusing. \u201cPeople go, \u2018Oh, my God, if you guys became the first family, then you can be pregnant in the White House!\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Slow down.\u2019 There\u2019s a lot of time between here and then.\u201d\n\nBooker\u2019s poll numbers are improving, and he qualified for the fifth Democratic debate in November, but this field is fraught and full.\n\nFor the first time in a while, though, she has a little breathing room just to be.", "description": "Up until now, they\u2019ve rarely been seen together in public, but the presidential candidate and the Hollywood star are in love.", "authors": ["Jada Yuan", "Feature Reporter Covering National Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2kmyrEAGbas5-Ur-vCSQsrGvRKs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3PT3CZXPQUI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
