Flock of cockatoos 0'.\n\nAfter receiving an onslaught of abuse by animal lovers and the general public, the senator tried to defend his post.\n\n'As the context of the post has been missed: I was driving at 100 km an hour outside of Warwick when a flock of cockatoos flew into the car,' he re-captioned the photo.\n\n'Like many people living in the country, wildlife and animal accidents while driving are a fact of life. The main thing is that all drivers should drive according to the conditions and prioritise their safety and that of fellow drivers.\n\n'To say that the post is boastful is wrong.'\n\nBut Facebook users remained unimpressed, pointing out he had shared multiple images of roadkill before.\n\nIn 2018, Mr McGrath shared a photo of a landcruiser with a huge dent in it, suggesting it had been hit by a kangaroo.\n\n'Roo v car = draw. The landcruiser won the other 5 roo hits last night,' he captioned the image.\n\nHe was caught boasting about killing wildlife again in a post from 2017 which showed two birds that had died as a result of getting stuck in his car's bullbar (pictured)\n\nIn 2018, Mr McGrath shared a photo of a landcruiser with a huge dint in it, suggesting it had been hit by a kangaroo (pictured)\n\nHe was caught boasting about killing wildlife again in a post from 2017 which showed two birds that had died after getting stuck in his car's bullbar.\n\n'I think dinner tonight has been sorted thanks to my bullbar.

You are a sick and twisted individual and people who enjoy killing animals tend to get bored and start killing people,' one Facebook user commented.\n\nMany social media users condemned his actions, with many labelling him as 'sick' and some even calling for his resignation\n\n'How many animals you killed today mate. Someone's dog? Someone's cat. You really are a sociopath,' one commented.\n\n'You are sickening! Any animal is better than you!' another said.\n\n'This isn't the first time you've boasted about killing native wildlife accident or not, don't bother trying to save your reputation now,' one comment read.\n\n'As a tax payer who is your employer, and I am sure many more I demand your resignation without any further financial benefits. You are a fruitcake and are disgraceful,' another person said.\n\nDaily Mail Australia has contacted James McGrath's office for comment.", "description": "Queensland senator James McGrath recently came under fire after boasting about a photo of a dead cockatoo who became wedged under his car's roof racks.", "authors": ["Eliza Mcphee For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/10/19433588-0-image-a-5_1570526015388.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
