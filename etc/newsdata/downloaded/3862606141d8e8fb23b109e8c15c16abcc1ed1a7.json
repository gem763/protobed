If you care about the working class, if you care about the American middle class \u2026 as a political matter, you have to out-Trump Trump on immigration if you want to win.\u201d\n\nThe latest Wall Street Journal analysis has revealed that Democrats have shifted over the last decade from being the party of America\u2019s working class to now representing the country\u2019s wealthiest and richest billionaires. On the other hand, President Trump\u2019s GOP has garnered huge support from working and middle-class Americans, in addition to union workers.\n\nCoulter called it \u201ca mistake\u201d for Democrats to be campaigning for increasing legal immigration levels, where already more than 1.2 million foreign nationals are admitted every year, and for open borders like decriminalizing illegal immigration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed some of the smarter liberals seem to be writing about \u2018Hey, Democrats running for president, you\u2019re getting a little bit crazy. You don\u2019t want to just please the social justice warriors because all of the voters whose votes you need think you\u2019re out of your mind,\u2019\u201d Coulter said.\n\nThough polling among all U.S. voters, and particularly with swing voters, finds campaigning for immigration, illegal and legal, is the most unpopular policy position, leading candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) have gone above and beyond past Democrat candidates in their vows to drive a large migration to the country.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
