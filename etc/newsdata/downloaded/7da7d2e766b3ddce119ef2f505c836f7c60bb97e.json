Flynn faced up to six months in prison for lying to federal law enforcement officials.\n\nPrison time would signal a downfall for Flynn, a retired general who once led the Defence Intelligence Agency before he was forced out in 2014.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Flynn had even asked Sullivan last year to delay his sentencing until he testified against Kian.\n\nBut instead of testifying in that case, prosecutors decided not use Flynn as a witness because he changed his account on the eve of the trial.\n\nKian was later convicted on violating foreign lobbying laws, but a hearing is set for Thursday about whether a conspiracy conviction should be thrown out because of a lack of evidence.\n\nFlynn\u2019s lawyers have insisted he cooperated fully with prosecutors, consuming his time and money.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Powell again accused prosecutors of hiding exculpatory evidence, known as Brady material, that would exonerate her client. Mr Powell is known for her dislike of the special counsel and is a staunch supporter of Trump.\n\nIt was not clear why Mr Powell told the judge she did not want to vacate the plea deal if she believes the government engaged in \u201cstunning failures\u201d to produce the exculpatory material.\n\nCriminal lawyers observing the case say that would be a logical move if she were convinced that the government had committed serious wrongdoing and she could prove it.\n\nProsecutors pushed back against some of her claims. Mr Powell said that text messages between former FBI officials disparaging Mr Trump \u2013 including from one of the agents who questioned Flynn \u2013 would have helped her client\u2019s case by showing bias among investigators.\n\nBut prosecutors said Flynn\u2019s previous lawyers were given the texts on two occasions before he pleaded guilty.\n\nAnd while Mr Powell said a Justice Department inspector general report \u201cdocumented\u201d the bias, the report explicitly said that internal investigators found no evidence of bias that affected investigative decisions.\n\nThe report did say, however, that the texts \u201ccast a cloud\u201d over the FBI\u2019s handling of the Clinton email investigation.\n\nIn addition, Mr Powell said that she wanted to see a Justice Department memo that she described as exonerating Flynn of being an agent of Russia. The government has not accused Flynn of that role.\n\n\u201cThat is not part of this case,\u201d Van Grack said. \u201cThat is not part of the act that he has pled guilty to. It was lying to the FBI about particular communications involving Russia, not being an agent of Russia.\u201d\n\nMr Powell has asked Sullivan to compel prosecutors to turn over Brady material and said she needs a security clearance to review classified information.\n\nProsecutors say the case did not involve classified information. Mr Powell told the judge that there would have been no need for a plea deal if the government had honoured its Brady obligations.\n\nThe judge is expected to decide those matters in the coming weeks and added that he wanted to bring some finality to the case, setting a tentative sentencing date for 18 December.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "Federal prosecutors have suggested that they might ask a federal judge to sentence former national security adviser Michael\u00a0Flynn to prison as doubts have emerged about whether he honoured the cooperation deal he made in his criminal case.", "authors": ["Adam Goldman"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/11/11/michael-flynn-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
