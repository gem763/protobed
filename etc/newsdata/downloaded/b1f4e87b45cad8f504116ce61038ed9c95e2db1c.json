It hasn't been successful and I don't know that there's any change in that regulatory perspective,\" he said.\n\nDirecTV has been bleeding satellite TV subscribers with users shifting to cheaper online streaming services like Netflix Inc <NFLX.O> and Amazon.com Inc's <AMZN.O> Prime service.\n\nAT&T lost 778,000 premium TV subscribers, which includes DirecTV users in the second quarter, more than the 544,000 it lost in the prior quarter, and expects the video losses to continue in the current quarter.\n\nShares of the wireless carrier rose 1% in after-market trading and those of Dish were up 1.8%. AT&T and Dish declined to comment.\n\nEarlier this month, activist investor Elliott Management Corp disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in the company and listed businesses, including DirecTV, as possible sale candidates.\n\nThe hedge fund urged the company to end its acquisition spree to focus on improving its business, while criticizing the $85 billion purchase of media company TimeWarner Inc last year and the $49 billion deal for DirecTV in 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Kenneth Li in New York and Neha Malara in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)", "description": "AT&T has also considered a spinoff of DirecTV into a separate public company, the report said.
