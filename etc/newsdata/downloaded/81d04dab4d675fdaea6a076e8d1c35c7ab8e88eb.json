REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\nThe headline event could be testimony on Thursday from Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, that was rescheduled after Trump\u2019s administration blocked a previously scheduled appearance.\n\nSondland, a political appointee and Trump political donor rather than a career diplomat, participated in a text message exchange that Democrats have said reveals the internal concern among aides that the Republican president\u2019s pressure on Ukraine to investigate a political rival, Joe Biden, was improper.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee, leading the impeachment inquiry, is scheduled on Monday to hear from Fiona Hill, former senior director for European and Russian Affairs on Trump\u2019s National Security Council.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry focuses on a July 25 phone call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate former Vice President Biden, a top contender for the Democratic nomination to face him in the 2020 presidential election, and Biden\u2019s businessman son Hunter Biden.\n\nDemocrats have accused Trump of pressuring a vulnerable U.S. ally to dig up dirt on a domestic political rival after withholding $391 million in U.S. security aid intended to help combat Russia-backed separatists in the eastern part of Ukraine.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing. The inquiry could prompt the House to approve articles of impeachment - formal charges - leading to a trial in the Senate on whether to remove Trump from office. The Senate is led by Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, who have shown little inclination towards removing him.\n\nThe Intelligence Committee also is scheduled to hear from Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent and State Department Counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl, a top aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\n\u201cWe expect to announce additional testimony from relevant witnesses in the coming days and remain prepared to compel testimony through duly authorized subpoenas as appropriate,\u201d Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said in a letter to House Democrats on Friday.\n\nThe most compelling details could come from Sondland, who is expected to discuss the text message exchange with Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine.\n\nSondland is expected to be asked why he relayed from Trump to other diplomats that the president said no \u201cquid pro quos\u201d connecting the Biden investigation with the U.S. aid and to respond to media reports that he may not believe Trump\u2019s insistence about no linkage between the two matters. Quid pro quo is a Latin term meaning a favour for a favour.\n\nZelenskiy agreed to investigate. Trump eventually allowed the aid.\n\nPRESSURE ON GIULIANI\n\nLawmakers also may debate whether to seek to compel testimony from Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney who was pushing for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nOn Thursday, two Giuliani associates - Ukraine-born Lev Parnas and Belarus-born Igor Fruman - who helped him with his efforts to investigate the Bidens were charged with scheming to violate U.S. campaign finance laws.\n\nGiuliani has defended his actions as proper in his role as Trump\u2019s lawyer.\n\nA source familiar with the probe said that as part of the investigation into Parnas and Furman, federal investigators, including Manhattan prosecutors, are \u201cexamining Giuliani\u2019s interactions\u201d with the two men.\n\nGiuliani disputed that, saying he would have expected to have heard from prosecutors.\n\n\u201cI think the probe is a malicious rumour,\u201d Giuliani told Reuters.\n\nGiuliani already has a subpoena from the Intelligence Committee demanding that he produce documents related to Ukraine by Tuesday. He has not said whether he will comply.", "description": "The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives will crank up its impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump this week as lawmakers return after a two-week recess, with closed-door testimony from current and former administration officials looming.", "authors": ["Karen Freifeld", "Mark Hosenball", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440681056&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0T7", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
