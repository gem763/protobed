Murray warned Fognini to \u201cshut up\u201d and complained repeatedly to umpire Fergus Murphy before eventually going down to a 7-6, 2-6, 7-6 defeat.\n\nMurray thus left the Shanghai Open in a state of high dudgeon. Not only had he wasted two opportunities to serve the match out \u2013 something he later suggested had never happened before in his career \u2013 but he also felt that Fognini had treated him disrespectfully on the court.\n\nThe initial flashpoint came at 5-5 in the third set, when Murray darted forward to the net and steered a straightforward volley into the open court for a winner. Fognini shouted as Murray struck the ball \u2013 perhaps in frustration \u2013 but Murray later suggested that the point should have been handed to him via the hindrance rule.\n\n\u201cI looked in the direction of where the noise came from,\u201d Murray later explained. \u201cHe then told me, \u2018Stop looking at me. What are you looking at me for?\u2019 I was, like, \u2018Well, I was just about to hit a shot and someone made a noise.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe told me to stop complaining, to have a sense of humour, that, \u2018When you have a volley on top of the net, you know you\u2019re not going to miss it.\u2019 I was like, \u2018I know I\u2019m not going to miss it, but I wanted to know where the noise came from.\u2019 It came from him, which you\u2019re not allowed to do. It\u2019s against the rules. It\u2019s hindrance. I would say in that moment, neither of us were in a joking or laughing kind of mood.\u201d", "description": "Andy Murray\u2019s 3hr 10min battle with Fabio Fognini became so heated on Tuesday that it spilled over into verbal confrontation.", "authors": ["Simon Briggs", "Tennis Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tennis/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000212433359-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqX3n_nFuiIT69qjR3ptN_V_uDrbhGyRvjppy5g6HeRD8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
