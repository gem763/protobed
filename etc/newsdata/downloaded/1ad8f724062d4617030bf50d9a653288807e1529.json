He announced his decision in an MSNBC interview on Friday.\n\nDe Blasio launched his bid in May, but his campaign largely failed to take off.\n\nDe Blasio said he feels he has contributed all he can \u201cto this primary election\u201d. He told MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe show \u201cit\u2019s clearly not my time\u201d.\n\nHe tweeted an abrupt announcement a little later on Friday morning.\n\nBill de Blasio (@BilldeBlasio) It\u2019s true: I\u2019m ending my candidacy for president. But our fight on behalf of working people is far from over. https://t.co/wlqhNmcZLv\n\nDonald Trump was more fulsome. In a tweet dripping with sarcasm, the president wrote that New York City is \u201cdevastated\u201d over the decision, and reminded the public that De Blasio had been registering 0% support compared with the other Democratic candidates in the race.\n\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Oh no, really big political news, perhaps the biggest story in years! Part time Mayor of New York City, @BilldeBlasio, who was polling at a solid ZERO but had tremendous room for growth, has shocking dropped out of the Presidential race. NYC is devastated, he\u2019s coming home!\n\nLeading contenders so far are Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris.\n\nDe Blasio failed to cross the threshold set by the Democratic party to be allowed onto the stage of the third Democratic primary debate, held for the 10 top candidates in Houston, Texas, last week.\n\nHis campaign never went down well with most New Yorkers and, although he performed reasonably well in the first two debates, in Miami and Detroit, his campaign never caught alight.\n\nShortly after he launched his campaign, a poll found that 76% of New York City voters didn\u2019t think he should run for president.", "description": "New York City mayor told MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe \u2018it\u2019s clearly not my time\u2019 after struggling to gain traction in a crowded field", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/488b697b7b0739909e98536451f9dba0682b31ad/0_281_7412_4450/master/7412.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1e582f53fc1339c05055047ff10680f5", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
