She was invited on trade missions and her business received public money. The connection between Johnson and Arcuri was first reported by the Sunday Times newspaper.\n\nThe referral was made by the monitoring office of the Greater London Authority to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, who will decide if Johnson should be investigated for misconduct in public office, a criminal offense. The IOPC is involved because as London mayor, Johnson was also the capital's policing and crime commissioner. The police must now decide whether the matter warrants further investigation.\n\nIn a letter to Johnson, the GLA's monitoring officer wrote: \"It has been brought to my attention that you maintained a friendship with Ms Jennifer Arcuri and as a result of that friendship allowed Ms Arcuri to participate in trade missions and receive sponsorship monies in circumstances when she and her companies could not have expected otherwise to receive those benefits.\"\n\nA spokesperson for No. 10 Downing Street told the BBC the referral was politically motivated. \"The prime minister, as Mayor of London, did a huge amount of work when selling our capital city around the world, beating the drum for London and the UK. Everything was done with propriety and in the normal way.\"\n\nSeparately, the Guardian reported that Arcuri received an entrepreneur visa allowing her to stay in the U.K. after Johnson raised the profile of her firm Innotech by giving keynote speeches at two of the company's events.\n\nArcuri told the paper, \u201cThe stories you are writing are more and more false. These are fake news.\u201d Asked to clarify which part of the story was false she replied, \"no comment.\"", "description": "Jennifer Arcuri denies benefitting improperly from her friendship with the UK prime minister.", "authors": ["Matei Rosca", "Emilio Casalicchio", "Charlie Cooper"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1171305814-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
