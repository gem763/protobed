(Photo: Ecco)\n\n\u201cNothing to See Here\u201d (Ecco, 254 pages, \u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd out of four stars) starts out normal enough. Lillian is 28 years old, working dead-end cashier jobs, smoking too much weed and living in her mom\u2019s attic when her best friend from high school, Madison, reaches out. She\u2019s rich and beautiful and married to a powerful senator now. Lillian is maybe in love with her.\n\nMadison needs Lillian to do her a solid \u2013 paid, of course. The senator\u2019s two kids from a previous marriage are coming to live at their Tennessee estate. They\u2019re a bit of a handful, and Madison wants Lillian\u2019s help caring for them and getting them acclimated. It\u2019s a big job, but what else is Lillian doing? Sure, she\u2019ll come play governess at Madison\u2019s mansion. She\u2019s got nothing going. What the heck?\n\nThere\u2019s just one catch: The children catch fire. Literally. As in, they spontaneously combust.\n\nMore: Prince memoir 'The Beautiful Ones' offers a glimpse inside the mind of a musical genius\n\nIt\u2019s a giddily lunatic premise, one that author Kevin Wilson (\u201cThe Family Fang\u201d) grounds with humor and deadpan matter-of-factness. Told in Lillian\u2019s refreshingly unfiltered and a-touch-crude voice, the story makes a pair of spontaneously combusting children seem plausible. \u201cThis is weird, Madison,\u201d Lillian says when her friend makes her pitch. \u201cYou want me to raise your husband\u2019s fire children.\u201d\n\nBessie and Roland's episodes are triggered by emotion or stress, like panic attacks, and there's a lot of emotion and stress that comes with being an unwanted fire child. They don\u2019t die when they combust, just smolder for a bit, destroying any clothing or combustibles in their path. Their mother, who raised them without the senator\u2019s help, died by suicide, ostensibly from the stress of raising them. The children are pariahs, their condition a liability to their father\u2019s political ambitions and a physical danger to his son with Madison, Timothy.\n\nLillian is a bit of a pariah too, though she oughtn\u2019t be. As a teen, she was kicked out of the posh prep school she shared with Madison; Madison was there because she was rich, Lillian because she was smart. When Madison was caught with drugs, Lillian was urged to take the fall. Now one of them is married to the potential future secretary of state, and the other mans a cash register.\n\nAuthor Kevin Wilson. (Photo: Leigh Anne Couch)\n\nWilson\u2019s observational humor is riotous in its specificity, his descriptions as generous as fistfuls of Halloween candy at the best house on the block. When we meet the senator, he\u2019s \u201cwearing a linen suit, looking like a preacher about to say the Lord\u2019s Prayer before the start of the Daytona 500.\u201d Even when Lillian first sees Bessie catch fire, the writing dazzles as much as the girl. \u201cAnd then, like a crack of lightning, she burst fully into flames, her body a kind of firework, the fire white and blue and red all at once. It was beautiful, no lie, to watch a person burn.\u201d\n\nBut what dazzles most are the warmly rendered dynamics of an ad hoc, dysfunctional family that desperately wants to work. Lillian, Bessie and Roland make for a shabby and ramshackle trio. But the more time Lillian spends with the kids, the more of herself she sees in the combative little human sparklers, the more driven she is to turn their liability into an asset. How do you learn to celebrate rather than mask what sets you apart, even if that thing is spontaneous human combustion?\n\nYes, Bessie and Roland are weird and broken. So is Lillian. So are, when you really start digging, picture-perfect Madison, her senator husband and cute little Timothy.\n\nSo is everyone.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2019/10/29/nothing-see-here-kevin-wilson-novel-book-review/2482329001/", "description": "Lillian's old best friend reaches out for her help raising her senator husband's two oldest kids.
