House committees are trying to determine if President Donald Trump violated his oath of office by asking a foreign country to investigate a political opponent.\n\nA quick summary of the latest news:\n\nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\n\u2014 Defying White House orders, an Army officer serving with President Donald Trump\u2019s National Security Council testified to impeachment investigators Tuesday that he twice raised concerns over Trump\u2019s push to have Ukraine investigate Democrats and Joe Biden.\n\n\u2014 House Democrats have unveiled an eight-page resolution that authorizes the next phase of the impeachment inquiry against Trump. It calls for open hearings and requires the intelligence committee to submit a report outlining its findings and recommendations.\n\n___\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\n\n\u2014 A panel of House investigators is scheduled to take depositions from two State Department advisers on Ukraine, Catherine Croft and Christopher Anderson. Kathryn Wheelbarger, acting assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, is also scheduled to meet with investigators.\n\n___\n\nNUMBERS THAT MATTER\n\nThe House is expected to vote Thursday on a resolution authorizing the next phase of the Trump impeachment inquiry, calling for open hearings led by the intelligence committee and granting limited powers to Republicans in the minority.\n\nThe move aims to neutralize GOP talking points the inquiry is illegitimate because the House has not voted to authorize it and the proceedings lack transparency.\n\nDemocrats have 234 members and need only 217 for a majority. So far, 228 have told the AP that they support the impeachment inquiry. Republican-turned-independent Justin Amash of Michigan has also said he supports the probe.\n\nSee where the surveyed members stand with this online tool, which will be updated with Thursday\u2019s vote:\n\nhttp://apne.ws/TJ9E5Gi\n\n___\n\nWORTH READING\n\nThe text of the eight-page resolution providing a roadmap for the next stage of the impeachment inquiry:\n\nhttp://apne.ws/NZ48JyW", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For only the fourth time in U.S. history, the House of Representatives has started a presidential impeachment inquiry.
