Through his own hard work he has been given that chance. I am very proud of him.\u201d\n\nEngland back Ben Spencer not to buckle in World Cup final baptism of fire Read more\n\nIf circumstances had played out differently, it might have been Ben lining up against South Africa on Saturday. In 2017, he was picked on the bench for an England XV to face the Barbarians before the tour of Argentina, only for a back injury to lead to his withdrawal and for Tom, his younger brother by 90 minutes, to take his place.\n\nTom has had his own struggles with injury since then, but has been a revelation in tandem with Sam Underhill at the World Cup, putting in a man-of-the-match performance in England\u2019s destructive quarter-final win against Australia, and following it up with another impressive display in the victory over New Zealand. \u201cHe said he was knackered,\u201d says Ben. \u201cBut you don\u2019t win those games without 100% effort. It\u2019s very tiring but it\u2019s a World Cup final and he will be ready.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 2:10 The haka: how England and others have responded to the All Blacks' challenge over the years \u2013 video\n\nBen insists there is no part of him that wishes he could sneak into his brother\u2019s England jersey on Saturday. \u201cI am going out there solely to support him and England,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a family we support each other in whatever we do, whether it\u2019s an under-15 final or one of the biggest stages in sport.\u201d\n\nThe brothers have come through the system at Sale Sharks, and Ben is full of praise for the club\u2019s director of rugby, Steve Diamond, and especially his willingness to bring through young players. \u201cIf you give that trust to young players, most of the time they give that back,\u201d he says. \u201cDiams has done really well both to develop players and give them the opportunity to succeed. Because if you don\u2019t give them the opportunity they can\u2019t take it.\u201d\n\nLess might be more for England as Eddie Jones savours final week Read more\n\nIt was Diamond who agreed that Curry should be allowed to travel to Yokohama on Tuesday \u2013 which means the flanker will miss Sale\u2019s Premiership game at Bristol Bears on Friday \u2013 because he felt it was the right thing to do.\n\n\u201cI massively appreciate what he and Sale have done,\u201d said Curry. \u201cIt just shows how much of a family-orientated club this is. I don\u2019t think many others would have done it. It\u2019s a privilege to be part of this club.\u201d\n\nThe brothers are clearly close and still share a house near Altrincham \u2013 one that Ben insists is now much tidier in his brother\u2019s absence. \u201cSince he\u2019s been away I\u2019ve also got two cats, which he is looking forward to meeting, but apart from that nothing has really changed,\u201d he says.\n\nEngland's Eddie Jones hits back at Gatland: 'Enjoy the third-place play-off' Read more\n\n\u201cWe have lived together for 21 years now \u2013 you kind of get bored with each other. It\u2019s nice to spend some time out of each other\u2019s back pockets.\u201d\n\nIt is clear the competitive fires still burn between them \u2013 whether it is on the PlayStation or the pitch. \u201cWhen I was younger I bashed him at Fifa. And I\u2019m better at table tennis, golf, swimming \u2026 and rugby,\u201d he says, smiling.\n\nIn four years\u2019 time at the next World Cup in France he intends to be playing with Tom in England\u2019s back row. \u201cI am very fortunate to be part of Tom\u2019s journey, and to be close to it, but the drive from every back\u2011rower is the same,\u201d says Ben. \u201cWe are all desperate to play in that shirt.\n\n\u201cSo I have to continue to develop each day and when Tom does come back to learn from him. Because he is one of the best players in the world right now. Why wouldn\u2019t I want to emulate him and learn from what he is doing?\u201d", "description": "Ben Curry has been given permission to go to Japan and watch his twin, Tom, in the World Cup final \u2013 \u2018We support each other in whatever we do\u2019", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f861bab0a2dc780d327448988181f113edb372b/41_40_2959_1776/master/2959.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1df07b08d3366491e8d2085d1f232df7", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
