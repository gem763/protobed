(ReutersTV)\n\nIt\u2019s been a rough week, with Washington awash in conflict, anger, lies, betrayals, finger-pointing, implausible denials, and blithe denial of glaring problems. It\u2019s like the whole town has taken on the spirit of the Redskins.\n\nLet\u2019s close out this week with four bits of good news: In an era where a lot of prominent voices are eager to label ideas they disagree with \u201chateful,\u201d itching to play censor, and chomping at the bit to \u201cde-platform\u201d those who challenge them, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg refused to play ball. The prospect of impeachment means that all of those Democratic senators running for president will have to put their campaigning on hold. For everyone who was waiting for America\u2019s business leaders to stand up to socialists in politics, Seattle\u2019s about to offer a key test case. And finally, a former head of Planned Parenthood is publicly discussing the moral complications of abortion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMark Zuckerberg Refuses to Bend the Knee\n\nYou may hate Mark Zuckerberg or you may love him \u2014 probably more in the former than the latter \u2014 but you have to give him credit: At this moment, a whole lot of powerful political, social, and economic entities would like to see him bend the knee and pledge that Facebook will remove statements from politicians that are deemed \u201cmisinformation.\u201d Clearly, these powerful forces are most outraged \u2014 arguably exclusively outraged \u2014 by social media posts from President Trump and his supporters. You never hear that Facebook should take down posts saying Elizabeth Warren\u2019s health care plan will not require tax increases on the middle class, or that Michael Brown was \u201cmurdered in Ferguson.\u201d Nobody ever got all that mad about Warren skewing research data from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. No, it\u2019s always Uncle Floyd sharing that WARREN IS AN AGENT OF COMMUNIST CHINA screed from PatriotFreedomEagle.net that is deemed the preeminent threat to democracy.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s speech is long, nuanced, and willing to dive into the details of what choices his company has to make and what influenced his decisions. A couple of highlights:\n\nSome people believe giving more people a voice is driving division rather than bringing us together. More people across the spectrum believe that achieving the political outcomes they think matter is more important than every person having a voice. I think that\u2019s dangerous. I believe we have two responsibilities: to remove content when it could cause real danger as effectively as we can, and to fight to uphold as wide a definition of freedom of expression as possible \u2014 and not allow the definition of what is considered dangerous to expand beyond what is absolutely necessary. That\u2019s what I\u2019m committed to . . . Political advertising is more transparent on Facebook than anywhere else \u2014 we keep all political and issue ads in an archive so everyone can scrutinize them, and no TV or print does that. We don\u2019t fact-check political ads. We don\u2019t do this to help politicians, but because we think people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying. And if content is newsworthy, we also won\u2019t take it down even if it would otherwise conflict with many of our standards. I know many people disagree, but, in general, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy.\n\nZuckerberg and Facebook have taken a lot of criticism, much of it deserved. But he\u2019s right to draw distinctions. Organized Russian-government-driven disinformation efforts are not the same as some yokel spouting off, and shouldn\u2019t be treated the same.\n\nThis section of Zuckerberg\u2019s speech might be particularly relevant to the National Basketball Association:\n\nIt\u2019s one of the reasons we don\u2019t operate Facebook, Instagram or our other services in China. I wanted our services in China because I believe in connecting the whole world and I thought we might help create a more open society. I worked hard to make this happen. But we could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there, and they never let us in. And now we have more freedom to speak out and stand up for the values we believe in and fight for free expression around the world.\n\nNotice that Zuckerberg\u2019s angriest critics just hand-wave away the concerns about freedom of expression in their denunciations.\n\n\u201cZuckerberg attempted to use the Constitution as a shield for his company\u2019s bottom line, and his choice to cloak Facebook\u2019s policy in a feigned concern for free expression demonstrates how unprepared his company is for this unique moment in our history and how little it has learned over the past few years,\u201d said Bill Russo, a spokesman for the presidential campaign of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nRight, right. Facebook is taking this position because of that $20 million in ad spending from the Trump campaign, otherwise the company would have to struggle to get by on a mere $55 billion in annual revenue. (Can we just observe that after the Hunter Biden foreign investor stuff, it\u2019s a bad idea for Joe Biden\u2019s campaign to denounce a company that said it refused to work with China because of censorship complaints?)\n\nFor Six Senators, the Impeachment Trial Could Come at the Worst Time\n\nNo human being can be in two places at once, and BuzzFeed notices that if you\u2019re a Democratic senator, you can\u2019t be sitting in judgment of an impeachment of a president and campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire at the same time. If your name is Cory Booker, Michael Bennet, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, or Elizabeth Warren, that\u2019s a problem. No one knows exactly when a Senate impeachment trial would start \u2014 talk of November sounds really early, so December or January seems more likely \u2014 and how long it would last. But for those six, it\u2019s likely to come at just about the worst possible time:\n\nIt\u2019s not as if senators can rely on showy moments during the trial like dressing down a witness during a committee hearing. Because senators are the jurors of an impeachment trial, they must live through every politician\u2019s nightmare of sitting and watching the proceedings without speaking . . . Sanders and Warren would have to fly out to places like New Hampshire and Iowa for evening events and then back to Washington in time for the next day\u2019s hearings.\n\nYou can almost see Joe Biden\u2019s Cheshire cat grin right now. The former vice president is currently in a close second to Warren in Iowa and New Hampshire. Retail politics, shaking hands in diners, showing up for every little event can only move the needle so much, but it can make a difference. (Best example I ever saw was Mark Sanford against Elizabeth Colbert Busch in 2013. He just outhustled her, doing five or so events a day open to everyone, while she was doing one tightly-scripted one with no questions from reporters.) If you\u2019re Biden, while the Senate is tied up in impeachment, you do events all day every day, and perhaps even more importantly, you focus on the future. Impeachment is going to be an angry, ugly slog focused upon the past and for a candidate who wants to win on Election Day 2020, it\u2019s a sideshow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmazon Decides It\u2019s Had Enough Socialism in Seattle Politics, Aims to Deliver New City Council\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo interconnected facts of our modern American life: corporate America is bigger, wealthier, and more influential than ever before, and socialism is more accepted, embraced and touted in American life than at any point since the end of the Cold War or even earlier. On paper, America\u2019s biggest corporations and business leaders have the most to lose from socialism. Yet we rarely see a consistent pushback; all too often, America\u2019s big companies push a sort of soft corporatism \u2014 which is on paper, the opposite of socialism, although maybe in practice it just means big business and big government teaming up against the little guy \u2014 and tout it as progressive or \u201cwoke capitalism.\u201d A lot of America\u2019s biggest businessmen think of themselves as forces for progressive change; think of Howard Schultz.\n\nFor those of us who believe in free peoples and free markets, this is the worst of both worlds. It was infuriating to watch big health insurance companies, endlessly demonized by Democrats, eagerly jump into bed with them to create the rules for Obamacare. Wall Street and big banks were the perpetual villains in Democratic stories, but they and their employees kept writing big checks to the party. Big corporations love regulations that give them a competitive advantage over newer, smaller companies.\n\nBut there\u2019s one under-the-radar sign that one of America\u2019s biggest companies has had enough trying to placate self-proclaimed socialist lawmakers.\n\nOn Tuesday, Amazon gave an additional million dollars to support business-friendly members of the City Council like [City Council candidate Egan] Orion. The tech giant has now poured an unprecedented $1.45 million into the local elections, and ballots are being sent to voters this week. (Washington votes by mail.) [Seattle City Council member Kshama Sawant] has long been an outspoken critic of large corporations, and it\u2019s not surprising that she\u2019s ended up in Amazon\u2019s sights. During a contentious City Council meeting last summer, she called Amazon\u2019s CEO Jeff Bezos the \u201cenemy.\u201d . . . Amazon has donated huge sums to the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce PAC. The Amazon-backed PAC is backing challengers against all but one of the three incumbents running for reelection, which has left many predicting that the City Council is going to look a lot different next year. The Washington Technology Industry Association, the state\u2019s largest tech trade group, which this year endorsed political candidates for the first time, also backed Orion. Top executives at Amazon, Boeing, and Microsoft have donated to Orion\u2019s campaign, including Jay Carney, the PR and policy chief for Amazon and former White House press secretary to President Barack Obama; and Sam Whiting, director of Boeing Global Engagement. \u201cIt\u2019s clear now to the majority of people that big corporations like Amazon are absolutely going to war against ordinary people in this city, in this election, and are attempting to buy this election,\u201d said Sawant. When asked if Orion felt comfortable with executives\u2019 donating money to his campaign, he responded with his own question: \u201cAre you referring to my neighbors? There\u2019s a large number of Amazon executives that live in district 3.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the perfect irony: for all extents and purposes, this is Seattle, which means there are no Republicans or conservatives in this story. This is a story of people in the private sector who think of themselves as good progressives getting sick and tired of being painted as the bad guy by other people who think of themselves as good progressives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSocialists, and perhaps even more importantly, the demographic we could characterize as socialism-curious, tell themselves a happy little fairy tale that America can thrive without a private sector that competes in a marketplace to provide the best goods and services. This fairy tale contends that capitalism is just a name for an egregiously unjust system of endless little demonstrations of greed and selfishness, and that we\u2019ve all just been waiting for an enlightened generation to come along and demonstrate that we can all be happier if the government takes over. Never mind that government at all levels regularly demonstrates waste, mismanagement, scandals, unaccountability, over-promising, under-delivering, etcetera. The problem is not the system of government; the problem is that the system is full of human beings and human beings are flawed.\n\nIn the socialists\u2019 mind, every success of government is a demonstration of the government\u2019s inherent superiority, and every failure of the government is just an example of a hidden sinister \u201ccorporate influence.\u201d Do Amazon executives want to live in a city that\u2019s struggling to deal with runaway real estate prices and rampant homelessness? Socialists frequently insist this is the case because they need a villain in their narrative. But Amazon executives and employees want to live in a thriving city too. They just have different ideas about how to achieve the goal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs Amazon above criticism? Hell no. But they comply with existing tax law, pay roughly $250 million in state and local taxes in Washington annually, and pay the single biggest property tax bill in the city. They have a right to argue that they do a lot for the city of Seattle and are tired of being the perpetual scapegoat for the city\u2019s problems.\n\nAnother important point: \u201cLabor groups have funneled $2,432,230 toward Seattle elections.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nADDENDUM: Holy smokes, no wonder Leanna Wen didn\u2019t fit in with Planned Parenthood. Speaking at the \u201cTIME 100 Health Summit,\u201d the recently deposed Wen declared, \u201cA lot of us believe that abortion is a complex moral issue. And we may not want to have an abortion ourselves but would never get in the way of somebody else making this deeply personal medical decision for themselves. Or maybe we\u2019re even uncomfortable about abortion but would not want women to die because they don\u2019t have access to safe, legal abortion either.\u201d\n\nPro-lifers obviously won\u2019t agree with that in full but give Wen credit for recognizing moral complexities and moral discomfort, at a time when the Democratic party and her previous employer are increasingly adamant that the issue isn\u2019t complicated, and that any limitation under any circumstances represents a draconian patriarchal injustice. Wen sounds like the kind of pro-choice advocate that a pro-lifer could have a good conversation with, and in this era, that\u2019s a small miracle.", "description": "Zuckerberg and Facebook have taken a lot of criticism, much of it deserved.
