Premiere", "language": "en", "text": "Kanye West brought his spiritual campaign to Los Angeles\u2019 The Forum on Wednesday (Oct. 23) to preview his ninth studio album Jesus is King and premiere the accompanying IMAX film two days before their slated release.\n\nThe arena was converted into an indoor field with tall grass as sounds of nature echoed through the speakers. The small line of merchandise that was being offered at the venue included deep blue sweatshirts, T-shirts, long-sleeved shirts and caps, matching the album\u2019s blue vinyl record, Jeopardy-esque artwork with yellow typeface that read \u201cNew Songs AR1331A and 33RPM LP,\" perhaps a nod to the album\u2019s availability on CD and vinyl along with streaming services.\n\nDirected by influential fashion photographer Nick Knight, the roughly 30-minute film showcased stunning cinematography of visionary artist James Turrell\u2019s eye-catching installation, the Roden Crater. It also spotlighted the beautiful voices and melanin faces of what appeared to be the members of West\u2019s choir, as seen and heard in his Sunday Service productions.\n\nWith attendees\u2019 Phones tucked into Yondr bags, photographic memories snapped away at the massive visuals featuring stunning, circular shots of Turrell\u2019s Skyspace, an art piece built on top of a dormant volcano located in the Painted Desert of Northern Arizona. Close-ups of the gospel singers, individually and as an ensemble, seemed to illuminate against a backdrop of blue skies peeking through a circular opening above their heads. Captivating images of the cylinder corridor from Turrell\u2019s art project -- for which West reportedly donated $10 million -- along with clips of a baby, white flowers, a mountain range with tumbling clouds and a deer running through grass heightened the heavenly nature of West\u2019s born-again Christian soundtrack.\n\nAmong the devotional setlist -- which impressively carried no curses -- was \u201cSelah,\u201d \u201cPerfect Praise\u201d and \u201cWhen I Think of His Goodness.\u201d West dipped into his earlier catalog and revised 808s & Heartbreak deep cuts \u201cSay You Will\u201d and \u201cStreet Lights\u201d into solemn rap hymns. While \u201cSay You Will\u201d played in the IMAX movie trailer, the gospel rendition of \u201cStreet Lights\u201d was presented during a scene where West sang the hook while dressed in the same brown attire as the chorus and swept the space with a broom. He was then joined by a supporting vocalist and two musicians seated at brown pianos.\n\nIn the flesh, West joined the horde of attendees on the floor of The Forum and blasted snippets of the album, pointing out that he was using a portable player that controlled the volume of certain track details like the vocals and baseline. There were no pamphlets or spoken introductions to identify which tracks were being played, but teasers sprinkled around the Internet from West\u2019s Sunday Service congregations, Coachella performance and previous listening sessions across the country help connect the dots. Ty Dolla $ign floats on the still Nicki Minaj-less version of \u201cNew Body\u201d while Clipse and Kenny G make formidable allies on \u201cUse The Gospel,\u201d where Pusha T cleverly rhymes about turning \u201cWraith talk into faith talk.\u201d\n\nWhile the project wasn\u2019t played in its entirety, West\u2019s attempt to spread the gospel through rap was as solid as a sermon delivered at mass. If \u201cGod is King and we\u2019re the soldiers\u201d (as one song expresses), \u2018Ye is the self-appointed lieutenant who still maintains the same level of self-awareness as the buzzy rapper who released \u201cJesus Walks.\u201d In 2004, West acknowledged that the \u201cDevil\u2019s tryin\u2019 to break me down.\u201d In 2019, West seemingly rebukes temptation and evil while acknowledging to the Devil, that he\u2019s \u201cBeen workin\u2019 for you my whole life.\u201d On this same song, he calls out the Christians for likely being \u201cthe first ones to judge me\u201d thus making him feel like \u201cnobody loves me.\u201d\n\nBut after a tumultuous two years for the frenetic artist known to make headlines for his missed album deadlines as well as his political and personal affiliations, this Kanye West seems to rock an invisible \u201cMake Jesus Great Again\u201d hat. While Jesus is King may be a shock to the system for Yeezy devotees who championed the slick-mouthed, arrogant and profane wordsmith with club-ready beats, this album feels on-brand for a man who\u2019s admitted his shaky relationship with God on wax many times since the start of his career. And if Yeezus wants to crown himself a vessel of nonsecular hip-hop with a message that penetrates deeper than the cussing and mumbling that crowd today\u2019s mainstream rotation, then Lord knows he has the God-given right.", "description": "Kanye West brought his spiritual campaign to Los Angeles\u2019 The Forum on Wednesday (Oct. 23) to preview his ninth studio album Jesus is King and premiere the accompanying IMAX film two days before their slated release.", "authors": ["Adelle Platon"], "top_image": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/kanye-west-live-2015-uu-billboard-1548.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
