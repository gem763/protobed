His $10 million fundraising haul in the third quarter was the sixth-most among Democrats and more than triple his total for the second quarter.\n\nMost importantly, he continues to inspire a fervent following known as the Yang Gang, supporters who wear blue \"MATH\" hats - a tribute to Yang's devotion to data that has since become an acronym for \"Make America Think Harder\" - and revel in his \"nerdy\" campaign.\n\nWhen Yang promised to become the first president to use PowerPoint in a State of the Union address, the Las Vegas crowd chanted, \"PowerPoint! PowerPoint!\"\n\nYang's central message \u2013 that automation is destroying U.S. jobs and that his \"Freedom Dividend\" is the best way to mitigate the damage \u2013 has particularly resonated with young, male Democrats, independents and some Republicans, according to Reuters/Ipsos polls.\n\nIn that sense, Yang appears to be drawing many of the same types of voters U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders did in his unexpectedly strong outsider run for the White House in 2016.\n\nAccording to Reuters polling data, Sanders supporters are three times as likely to choose Yang as their second favorite than backers of either U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren or former Vice President Joe Biden, the other two leading contenders.\n\nLas Vegas resident Kelsey McCormick, 30, said she \"fell in love\" with Yang after hearing about his universal basic income proposal.\n\n\"It's refreshing for a politician to say he'll give people what they need without telling them how to use it,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBUILDING A 'YANG GANG' GROUND GAME\n\nBuoyed by last quarter's cash infusion, Yang's team is aggressively hiring in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, just in time for the crucial stretch ahead of the first nominating contests in February.\n\nYang's aides, while reluctant to share precise figures, said the campaign staff - currently in excess of 75 - had tripled since Sept. 1 and would triple again by Nov. 1.\n\nThe hiring spree is aimed at translating Yang's online strength \u2013 including Yang Gang volunteers across the country \u2013 into on-the-ground operations such as neighborhood canvassing and phone banks.\n\nSeveral Democratic officials in New Hampshire and Iowa said Yang's ground operations still lag well behind those of his main rivals, including Warren, Biden, Sanders and others, who were able to build up teams earlier in the year.\n\nLast week, Yang staffers held a two-day retreat in New York City, where they mapped out strategy and played appropriately nerdy bonding games, like presidential trivia.\n\nThe campaign, whose top aides early on were all political neophytes, has brought on more than a half-dozen seasoned Democratic operatives since the summer.\n\nOne of those new hires is national organizing director Zach Fang, who oversaw field operations in several states for Sanders' 2016 campaign and previously worked for Democratic U.S. Representative Tim Ryan's presidential campaign this year.\n\nLike many of Yang's supporters, Fang said he joined because Yang's focus on automation made sense to him after he spent time working in Silicon Valley, where he saw firsthand the way technology was threatening traditional work.", "description": "Entrepreneur Andrew Yang knows most people initially viewed his candidacy for U.S. president \u2013 and his campaign promise to guarantee every American a basic, government-funded income \u2013 as a gimmick.  \"You all heard at some point there's an Asian man running for president who wants to give everyone", "authors": ["Joseph Ax"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
