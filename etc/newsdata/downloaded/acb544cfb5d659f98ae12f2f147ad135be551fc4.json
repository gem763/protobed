The Straits Times\n\nWhen a social media influencer\u2019s post calling two men wearing turbans \u201chuge obstructions\u201d to her view at the Singapore Grand Prix went viral, some among the Sikh community felt uncomfortable.\n\nBut increasingly heated online criticism of Sheena Phua, an Instagram beauty and travel content influencer with more than 76,000 followers, led a group of young Sikhs to an unconventional response: they invited her to an informal tour of a gurdwara so that she could learn more about their traditions.\n\nSarabjeet Singh, 34, the president of the Young Sikh Association (YSA), told The Straits Times his group\u2019s gesture took some thinking through.\n\n\u201cSome responses to Sheena\u2019s original post felt like a case of cyberbullying. (Although) there were some among us who were also a little uncomfortable with her initial post, we recognised it as an opportunity for us to reach out and engage,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe still feel that we did not want an apology. Would an apology alone have done anything to improve awareness and understanding?\u201d\n\nRead Also: A girl called out her Instagram-loving sister for posting a picture that looked like she was on a hike when she was actually in their backyard\n\nPhua, 29, has apologised for the controversial remarks she made on Instagram two Saturdays ago (Sept 21). She had posted a photo of two men wearing white turbans standing in front of her at the Singapore Grand Prix, and captioned it: \u201cDang! Two huge obstructions decided to pop out of nowhere.\u201d\n\nShe later clarified that the word \u201cobstructions\u201d was intended to refer only to the height of the two men who were both taller than her, and so had been taken out of context.\n\nShe told ST: \u201cI did some reflection and agreed with (some) people that although the video was not outrightly racist, it was insensitive and had caused a lot of distress to the Sikh community\u2026 I decided to take up the YSA\u2019s offer to learn more.\u201d\n\nLast Saturday, a week after her divisive post, Ms Phua took up YSA\u2019s invitation to a four-hour visit to the Central Sikh Temple in Towner Road, which she said \u201cshowed how peaceful the Sikh religion is\u201d.\n\nThe YSA was formed in 2003 by a group of young Sikh Singaporeans to empower young Sikhs and enhance mutual understanding among people of different ethnic groups.\n\nWhile at the gurdwara, Ms Phua was given an introduction to the Sikh religion and culture, and had questions like how Sikhs greet each other answered.\n\nShe also participated in sewa, or an act of service, by trying her hand at making chapati in the community kitchen.\n\nShe was also showed the Guru Granth Sahib, the principal scripture of Sikhism.\n\nRead Also: Gucci is facing criticism by the Sikh community over a $800 turban\n\nMs Phua told ST she has a close friend who is Sikh but that she has never discussed religion and culture with her, saying: \u201cI never really truly delved deeper into understanding the religious practices (of others). For many youths, the issues we discuss revolve around mundane issues like fashion, gossip and travel.\u201d\n\nShe said that she hopes she will get more opportunities to interact with minority groups because \u201cthey have definitely contributed to (Singapore\u2019s) growth as a society.\u201d\n\nMr Sarabjeet, a civil servant, said he was glad Ms Phua took up YSA\u2019s offer, hoping that \u201call of us have walked away as better people\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cShe demonstrated humility, kindness, curiosity and sincerity, and that is more important to us.\u201d\n\nRead Also: 4 in 10 Singaporeans get upset by neighbours burning incense and joss sticks: IPS survey", "description": "Business Insider - Sikhs invite influencer to gurdwara after offensive Instagram post about \"turban obstruction\" goes viral..
