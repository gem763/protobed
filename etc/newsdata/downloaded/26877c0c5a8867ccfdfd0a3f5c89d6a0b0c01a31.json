But you\u2019ll be no good to anyone if you\u2019re worn-out. So put aside some special \u2018me-time\u2019 where you can relax and recharge.\n\nTAURUS April 21-May 21 ***\n\nYou\u2019ve got enormous dreams and creative schemes but don\u2019t get too far ahead of yourself. If you promise too much \u2013 and then fail to deliver \u2013 then everyone will just end up disappointed.\n\nGEMINI May 22-June 21 ***\n\nThe focus is firmly on your job or your public reputation. If a problem crops up then handle it in a calm, compassionate and sensitive way. It\u2019s definitely not the time to indulge in gossip Gemini!\n\nCANCER June 22-July 23 ***\n\nWhen it comes to travel, education or your plans for the future, there are plenty of people with ideas about what you should be doing. Listen to what others have to say, and then make your own decision.\n\nLEO July 24-Aug 23 ***\n\nMystery abounds and all is not as it appears today Lions. There is a lot happening beneath the surface and you\u2019ll have to tune into your intuition to discover what\u2019s really going on!\n\nVIRGO Aug 24-Sep 23 **\n\nA personal relationship or business partnership will leave you feeling somewhat confused today. Don\u2019t assume you know what\u2019s going on. Ask for clarification in a calm and sensitive way.\n\nLIBRA Sep 24-Oct 23 ***\n\nDon\u2019t let someone talk you down. Be brave and believe in yourself. So your motto is from Libran birthday great, Eleanor Roosevelt. \u201cNo one can make you feel inferior without your consent.\u201d\n\nSCORPIO Oct 24-Nov 22 ***\n\nCatching up with family members or close friends adds to an already frantic day for time-poor Scorpios. If someone needs your help, be as sensitive and compassionate as you possibly can.\n\nSAGITTARIUS Nov 23-Dec 21 **\n\nAvoid being too judgmental about a family matter. And beware thinking you have all the answers. There are many grey areas and you just don\u2019t have all the relevant facts at the moment.\n\nCAPRICORN Dec 22-Jan 20 ***\n\nRelationships and connections within your local community look productive today, as you reach out and help someone in need. But strive to be extra patient with a confused family member.\n\nAQUARIUS Jan 21-Feb 19 ***\n\nYou\u2019re walking a fine line at the moment as you strive to get the balance right between having big bold dreams and actually putting them into practice. Stay on track and walk your talk.\n\nPISCES Feb 20-March 20 ****\n\nThe Moon and Neptune link up in your sign today Pisces, which highlights emotional healing. It\u2019s also the perfect time to express yourself in imaginative, creative and artistic ways.\n\nYOUR DAY\n\nToday\u2019s stars encourage compassion, creativity and spirituality.\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY\n\nYou are a charming person but resist the urge to be complacent. Home is where the heart is in 2020, as you re-connect with your nearest and dearest.\n\nCopyright Joanne Madeline Moore 2019", "description": "See what the stars have in store for you today.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7771/4c81d849f8a742a686d60e5951098f76.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
