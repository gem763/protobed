Jackson First Celebrity To Voice Amazon Alexa", "language": "en", "text": "Photo: Gregg DeGuire/WireImage\n\nAlexa, where is my super suit? Soon you\u2019ll be able to hear the dulcet tones of Samuel L. Jackson answer that question instead of your favorite personal robot assistant, Alexa. Variety reported on Wednesday night that Jackson will provide a voice option for the Amazon device Alexa, making him the first celebrity to lend his voice to the company\u2019s cloud-based digital assistant. Jackson\u2019s voice will be available to purchase for $.99 for a limited time only before prices sky rocket to $4.99 in 2020.\n\nTo activate Jackson\u2019s \u201cvoice pack,\u201d users will say a phrase that Gwyneth Paltrow has uttered to herself countless times: \u201cAlexa, introduce me to Samuel L. Jackson.\u201d Users will then get to choose between explicit or non explicit language, so the whole family can ask Alexa how to get those mother-loving snakes off of that mother-trucking plane!\n\nAmazon also teased that more celebrities will be lending their voice to Alexa in the coming year. The mystery surrounding which celebrity might be the next voice of Alexa puts the mystery of who is Egg on The Masked Singer to shame. It begs the question: which celebrity\u2019s voice is distinct yet soothing enough voice to welcome into our daily lives? Maybe James Earl Jones? Holly Hunter, perhaps? Solid options, but if we had our way, every Alexa would be voiced by Michelle Williams as Gwen Verdon.", "description": "Samuel L.
