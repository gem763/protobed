Released on Sept. 19, 2017, the song has had quite a journey.\n\nSitting on the chart for 17 weeks now, \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d likely got its final boost to the top after Lizzo\u2019s booty-shaking, wig-snatching performance of the power anthem at the 2019 MTV VMAs.\n\nPreviously, the song was featured in a scene in the Netflix film \u201cSomeone Great,\u201d which came out in April, and was subsequently added to the 31-year-old\u2019s 2019 LP, \u201cCuz I Love You.\u201d\n\nBillboard also noted in its coverage of the news that Lizzo is the sixth female rapper to top the chart alongside Cardi B, Iggy Azalea, Shawnna, Lil\u2019 Kim and Lauryn Hill.\n\nIn light of that feat, Lizzo tweeted that she was \u201chonored.\u201d\n\nShe also tweeted a screenshot of the Hot 100 chart with her name at the top, telling her fans that the achievement was \u201cfor all of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnybody who ever felt like they voice wasn\u2019t heard. Anybody who felt like they weren\u2019t good enough. You are. We are. Champions. I love yall,\u201d she wrote.\n\nWE\u2019RE NUMBER 1. THIS IS A W FOR ALL OF US.
