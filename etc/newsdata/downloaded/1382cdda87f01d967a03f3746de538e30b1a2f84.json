The score measures a phone\u2019s recording and playback capabilities.\n\nThe site tested seven devices of five brands for initial testing; the Huawei Mate 20 X leading the rankings followed by the iPhone XS Max and the iPhone 11 Pro Max+.\n\nDxOMark has built a custom anechoic box \u2014 a room that absorbs all sound to test the recoding capabilities of in-built mics of a phone \u2014 to test out recording and playback.\n\nDxOMark\u2019s audio recording setup\n\nEngineers at the facility mainly look to test different scenarios such as recording a selfie video, a street performance, a concert, or a meeting. All these situations present different difficulties in recording audio. While it might be challenging for a phone to record a concert with high volume or bass without distortion, a classical performance requires it to pick out the timbre of every instrument. In a meeting, a phone should be able to capture audio in such a way that you can pick out individual voices.\n\nThe team also tests a phone\u2019s ability to handle background noise, the direction of the source sound, and the effect on the recording based on how you hold your phone.\n\nDxOMark has also built a special listening room to test the playback of the phone. For now, it only measures playback from phone\u2019s speakers. It tests scenarios such as playing a game or sharing music with a group with a focus on clarity of sound.\n\nWhile playing sounds from a phone\u2019s speakers the site\u2019s team measures factors such as timbre, soundscape, balance, and volume. It also observes how clean the sound is during the playback i.e how it gets rid of the noise or unwanted frequencies.\n\nJust as DxOMark\u2019s camera scores, you shouldn\u2019t take audio scores at a face value and consider it an absolute benchmark of a phone\u2019s sonic ability. Plus, DxOMark uses perpetual (experts listening to audio) and objective methods (measurement by equipment) to assign a score to a phone. So, there\u2019s a lot of room for debate whether this is an ideal method to gauge a phone\u2019s audio.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FiPhone-Speaker.jpg&signature=cd0d6239361001f09f8c4b649f5db135", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
