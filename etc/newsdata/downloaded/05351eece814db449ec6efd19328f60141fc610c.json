But the Masters champion quickly found his game, making birdies on four of his next six holes to get to 1-under, two strokes behind with nine holes to play.\n\nHe continued his strong form after the turn, carding three straight birdies from the par-3 third hole to move into a share of the lead at 4-under with Hideki Matsuyama and Gary Woodland.\n\nWoods then took the sole lead with a long birdie putt on No. 7, another par-3. His tee shot on the final hole hit a tree and bounced back on to the fairway, a fortunate bounce that set up another birdie with a 194-yard approach shot that landed three-feet from the hole.\n\nOrganizers said there were over 20,000 fans in attendance on the opening day.\n\nHeavy rain from a storm over the Pacific Ocean is expected on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tiger Woods shot a 6-under 64 in the first round of the Zozo Championship, the PGA Tour's first tournament in Japan.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jim Armstrong"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/22/japan_golf_zozo_championship_85158_c0-183-2821-1828_s1200x700.jpg?176fcd9c23eece631a00ad61ed7219036be417bd", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
