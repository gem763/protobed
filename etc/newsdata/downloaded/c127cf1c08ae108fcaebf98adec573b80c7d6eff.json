From his rib-tickling interview with the president-elect to his dismissal by tweet in March 2018, Shulkin says he was blindsided at almost every turn by a multitude of institutions, from his inspector general to the media. And he says veterans are paying the cost.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe VA was once thought to be the only part of the federal government that was above politics,\u201d Shulkin, 60, writes. But \u201cthe environment in Washington had grown so toxic, chaotic and subversive that it became impossible for me to accomplish the important work that our veterans need and deserve.\u201d\n\nUltimately his own staff did him in, Shulkin writes, turning ethics questions about a trip he took to Europe that mixed business with pleasure to their advantage. The Ivy League-trained physician who had excelled at turning around ailing hospitals was unprepared for the onslaught.\n\nThe score-settling book, to be published Tuesday by a division of Hachette Book Group, is Shulkin\u2019s comeback to the forces that derailed him. He describes a deep state of subordinates within his own inner circle \u2014 not of career bureaucrats but political appointees \u2014 who assumed outsize power with a singular goal: to privatize veterans\u2019 health care.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe book offers the first inside account of a federal agency from a former Trump Cabinet member.\n\nThe \u201cpoliticals,\u201d who included his communications chief and multiple senior advisers, distrusted him from the start because he was an Obama holdover, Shulkin writes. But, aided by an upstart veterans group funded by the conservative Koch network, there was more to their agenda, he writes: They wanted to turn the vast veterans health-care system over to the private sector, and he got in the way.\n\n\u201cPrivatization leading to the dismantling of the department\u2019s extensive health care system is a terrible idea,\u201d he writes. He accuses his critics of pushing \u201cunfettered\u201d access to private care that would cost taxpayers billions of dollars, ignoring the more moderate approach he advocated.\n\nAD\n\nBy asserting a moral high ground over his detractors, almost all of whom have left VA, Shulkin opens himself to reliving the acrimony he set out to chronicle.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhile the former VA secretary chooses to profit off his time in office and share outlandish claims about his private conversations with the President, President Trump remains focused on ensuring veterans receive the care they have earned through their incredible sacrifice for our Nation,\u201d White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement.\n\nVA officials declined to comment. Robert Wilkie, Shulkin\u2019s successor, and the Koch-allied group, Concerned Veterans for America, have long disputed that they want to privatize the system.\n\nAD\n\nCVA senior adviser Dan Caldwell called the claims a \u201cflagrant mischaracterization of CVA\u2019s vision, the work of our dedicated grassroots army, and our policy agenda.\u201d\n\nShulkin gives few new insights into Trump\u2019s style or thinking. The president stayed on the sidelines of the civil war consuming the agency, supporting Shulkin until bad headlines emerged and the powerful Mar-a-Lago crowd\u2019s disenchantment made him a liability, he says in the book.\n\nAD\n\nAt one point, Shulkin writes, Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, an influential White House adviser, consider closing poor-performing VA hospitals by executive order until Shulkin talks them out of it, telling them that Congress must authorize such a drastic decision.\n\nAD\n\nThe secretary\u2019s fall from grace was the subject of extensive media reports last year. But his book portrays his sense of betrayal by his staff, a group he had no hand in hiring, and by a White House he says refused to come to his defense.\n\nShulkin said in an interview that he wrote the book both to \u201cto tell my side of the story\u201d and to \u201cshare what I had learned and put down a road map\u201d for anyone considering serving in Washington.\n\nThe memoir describes Marvel Entertainment Chairman Ike Perlmutter, a friend of the president who brokered Shulkin\u2019s introduction to Trump, as forming an un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox shadow Cabinet with two associates that called many of the shots in the agency\u2019s day-to-day operations. One of the associates, Marc Sherman, who acts as a representative for the three, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s election in 2016, Shulkin was preparing to resign as former president Barack Obama\u2019s undersecretary for veterans\u2019 health when he received an urgent, mysterious call from Michael Cohen, the president\u2019s now-jailed fixer. Cohen patched him through to a voice with a thick Israeli accent, who summoned him to Mar-a-Lago that night, he writes.\n\nAfter a grilling by Perlmutter and two associates, a trio that would become his boosters, protectors and ultimately cut him loose, he writes, Shulkin was riding the elevator to the 26th floor of Trump Tower in New York.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good-looking guy, isn\u2019t he?\u201d were the president-elect\u2019s first words to his staff about Shulkin, he writes. He didn\u2019t really fit the bill of the generals Trump swooned over. \u201cBut can they fix health care?\u201d Trump asked.\n\nAD\n\nShulkin describes early successes in improving access to primary and mental health care, making wait times public and expanding care to remote areas through technology known as telehealth. Ambitious projects to revolutionize electronic health records and improve Choice, the Obama-era law expanding private-sector care, were in the pipeline. He encountered a VA workforce largely committed to serving veterans, he writes.\n\nAD\n\nSigns of trouble percolated quickly. Political appointees who worked for him held secret meetings without him, often at the White House. Shulkin began to suspect his security detail of showing signs of disloyalty, circulating his schedule outside the agency and snapping photos of him doing errands, exposing him to security risks.\n\nAnd the Mar-a-Lago crowd, as they came to be known in VA circles, was hovering. Perlmutter called multiple times a day seeking information and giving direction, the book says. Shulkin bristled but complied.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn just about every conversation I had with him . . . the president asked if Ike was \u2018happy\u2019 or \u2018helping,\u2019 \u201d a reminder that the White House \u201cwas impatient with the pace of reform,\u201d Shulkin writes.\n\nThe White House personnel office, which the book describes as inept and obstructionist, rejected many of his candidates for senior-level staff, instead foisting \u201clike-minded partisans\u201d on him.\n\nAD\n\nA Washington Post story in September 2017 was a devastating turning point in his tenure, he writes. The story described a 10-day trip that Shulkin, his wife and senior staff took to Europe, combining official travel with sightseeing and tennis at Wimbledon.\n\nAt the time, the administration faced widening criticism of travel expenditures among some of the billionaires, budget hawks and business executives who led federal agencies.\n\nShulkin devotes considerable space in his book to re-litigating his defense of the trip, which he claimed then and now involved no wrongdoing. He and his wife were \u201cvillainized for some sightseeing in London,\u201d he writes.\n\nHe hoped an investigation by VA Inspector General Michael J. Missal would clear his name. It didn\u2019t, instead citing lapses in judgment. Shulkin is still angry at Missal, whose investigators he assails in the book as \u201ctwisting facts\u201d and having \u201can agenda\u201d to land a case. Missal declined to comment.\n\nBy the time he became embroiled in a nasty fight with conservatives in Congress and the White House over legislation to expand the Choice program, the stars had aligned against him, Shulkin writes. He became increasingly isolated, with little support from the White House, he writes, his enemies gaining the upper hand.", "description": "Ultimately his own staff members did him in, David Shulkin writes, turning ethics questions about a trip he took to Europe to their advantage.", "authors": ["Lisa Rein", "Reporter Covering Federal Agencies", "The Management Of Government In The Trump Administration"], "top_image": "https://washingtonpost.com/pf/resources/images/favicon.ico?d=132", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
