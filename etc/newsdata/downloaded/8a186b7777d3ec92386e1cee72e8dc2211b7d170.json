'I mean, you just met him. You know, as a parent, I got to say it's a little crazy.'\n\n'When you just know, you know,' she says. 'John was not good to me. You know that.'\n\nLove fool: Lacey is caught in a love triangle with John (pictured), who was her high school sweetheart, and Shane, 21, who was just released from prison\n\nHer dad has a valid point when he asks her what makes her think that Shane is going to be any different.\n\nShane and John aren't the only jailbirds she has fallen for. Most of the guys she has dated have been in or ended up in prison, including her children's father.\n\n'I could understand why dad doesn't want me with another felon,' Lacey admits in her testimonial. 'He wants me dating somebody normal, but Shane is the most level-headed person I've ever met.'\n\nLacey does her best to convince him that 'there's no comparison' between Shane and John, knowing that her dad has never been a fan of her fianc\u00e9.\n\n'I've gotten to know Shane. He's a really good guy,' she insists.\n\nBombshell: Lacey recently confessed to John that she has feelings for Shane, and it seems like she is is getting ready to kick her fianc\u00e9 to the curb\n\nGets it: The adult entertainer has a history of dating felons, and she understands why her dad would want her to be with a 'normal' guy\n\nJohn can't stop firing off questions as he tries to process what Lacey is saying just three days before her fianc\u00e9 is supposed to be released from prison.\n\n'What what do you want with my daughter? Why are you even here?' he asks his daughter's latest flame.\n\nShane says he is 'getting to know Lacey' before adding: 'I just really, really love her.'\n\n'She's got a great heart,' he adds. 'I mean, great personality. There's nothing I don't like about her.'\n\nJohn then wants to know how old Shane is, and he is not happy when he finds out the answer.\n\nHere me out: Lacey does her best to convince him that 'there's no comparison' between Shane and John, knowing that her dad has never been a fan of her fianc\u00e9\n\nDevoted? The dad gets even angrier when he learns that Shane is only 21, though Lacey's beau insists he'll find a way to take care of her and her three children\n\n'Twenty-one, Lacy!' That's a baby,' I mean last month it was John, John, John. Now we got Shane, fresh out of prison and 21.'\n\nTo his credit, Shane wasn't too bothered by his interrogation, though he was admittedly sick of hearing about a guy he has never met.\n\n'Lacey's dad seems like a very concerned dad. He only wants what's best for his daughter, and I totally understand that,' he says in his testimonial. 'But I am ready to move on from this guy John. It's about me and Lacey. It's not about her and John.'\n\nLacey's dad is also concerned about his daughter's three children and wants to know if Shane knows anything about raising kids.\n\n'What makes you think you can take care of my daughter and her kids?' he asks.\n\n'I believe you can do anything if you put your mind to it,' Shane responds. 'And I if I really love her and I care about her, I am gonna step up to the plate. I'm gonna do what I gotta do to support these kids and her.'", "description": "Lacey, a cam girl known as Kaci Kash, is caught in a love triangle with her high school sweetheart John, 33, and her much-younger boyfriend Shane.", "authors": ["Erica Tempesta For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/01/19864348-0-image-a-254_1571357799509.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
