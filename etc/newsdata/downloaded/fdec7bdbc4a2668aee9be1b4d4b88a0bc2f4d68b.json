(\u201cPetroteq\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSXV:PQE; OTC:PQEFF; FSE: PQCF), a fully integrated surface oil sands clean recovery mining oil company with proprietary technology, is pleased to announce that the Company has achieved stabilized production rates and sales of heavy oil from its Asphalt Ridge Facility in Utah. Since re-commissioning the plant in September 2019, the Company has achieved the following:\n\n\n\ncumulative sales of 1,000 barrels of heavy oil\n\nstabilized production rate of 200 bbl/per day from the facilities current daily 12 hour shift\n\noil quality (namely, clay percent and oil thickness) to meet the requirements of specific buyers\n\nIn addition, production numbers are anticipated to improve from an expected automation of the facilities centrifuge process which is due to begin shortly and the initiation of a 24 hour shift of plant operations.\n\n\u201cWe believe our ongoing drive to deliver innovative Clean Oil Recovery Technology (\u201cCORT\u201d) is paying off, and our most recent advances in oil quality, oil sales and consistent production, holds the additional promise of increased economic performance that should help us strengthen our balance sheet and our corporate value,\" said David Sealock, Petroteq\u2019s CEO.\n\nThe Company\u2019s optimization strategy of complete automization of the facility also has the potential to further reduce the costs of production through lower labor costs, and increase the price paid by refiners as automation is expected to result in higher quality oil.\n\nAs Petroteq prepares for the next 30 to 60 days of production, the Company expects that the estimated production rates will be increased incrementally to ensure that the oil meets or exceeds the local refineries\u2019 requirements. Petroteq\u2019s 30 to 60 day forecast is to potentially achieve production and sales rates of approximately up to 600 bbls/d, with continued weekly sales in the interim.\n\nWhile the Company\u2019s projected production figures are preliminary estimates that are subject to adjustments, based on current projections the Company expects for its cash-flow to breakeven with its operating and general and administrative expenses in the first calendar quarter of 2020, which is anticipated to eliminate the need for further share issuances and dilution to the Company\u2019s stock to cover monthly expenses (excluding additional capital expenditures).\n\nPetroteq believes that the Asphalt Ridge facility is the first known commercial plant demonstrating this technology. The patented technology, which has already been licensed to one US company, has the potential to be licensed globally.\n\nFor more insight into the potential for the CORT technology and the Company\u2019s growth please watch this video: \u201c Petroteq Vision \u201d\n\nPhase 2 Asphalt Ridge Expansion Plans\n\nPetroteq has begun the preliminary engineering and pre-construction activities with Valkor Engineering for a proposed expansion to 3,000 bbl/d.\n\nAbout Petroteq Energy Inc.\n\nPetroteq is a fully integrated oil and gas company focused on the development and implementation of a new proprietary technology for oil extraction.
