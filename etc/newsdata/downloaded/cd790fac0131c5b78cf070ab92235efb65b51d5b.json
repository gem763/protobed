The case has been delayed for several months, and Myeni herself has been scarce.\n\nEarlier this year, Corruption Watch launched a delinquency application in the High Court regarding the former CEO and CFO (Brian Molefe and Anoj Singh) for their role in the now widely-publicised dealings within Eskom. It remains to be seen whether this will succeed.\n\nREAD: Corruption Watch files Eskom board delinquency papers\n\nHow it works\n\nSection 162 of the Companies Act compels the courts to declare a director delinquent or place them under probation for, among other things, gross abuse of the position of director; taking personal advantage of information or opportunities of the company; intentional or gross negligence which inflicts harm on a company or its subsidiaries; or in the event that a director is personally convicted at least twice of an offence in terms of any legislation.\n\nBarring the straightforward two personal convictions, the remainder of the grounds upon which a director may be declared delinquent will vary on a case-by-case basis. To demonstrate gross abuse of a position of a director, intentional or gross negligence and other grounds contemplated in the Companies Act will necessarily depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.\n\nPast cases\n\nSince the coming into effect of Section 162 of the Companies Act, several cases of delinquency have been decided upon by our courts. Some of the examples where directors were declared delinquent are instructive, and make it clear that delinquency will be ordered under circumstances which generally involve dishonesty on the part of directors and typically cause a damage of a financial nature.\n\nIn what was likely the first decided case of on delinquency in the case of Msimang N.O and Another vs. Peter John Katuliiba and Others, the court declared the directors of Memeza-QRX (Pty) Ltd delinquent for failure to cause the preparation of annual financial statements and to convene the statutory annual general meetings of the company for several years.\n\nOn 31 May 2013, the issue came up before the South Gauteng High Court in the case of Lobelo and Others vs. Kukama and Others.\n\nIn this case, the directors of the company sought to declare their fellow director a delinquent director for, among other things, making fraudulent claims for tax refunds from SARS in the name of the company, and also for diverting tax refunds that were due to the company to other entities that Kukama controlled.\n\nThis was a clear case of financial misconduct and the court did not hesitate to declare Kukama a delinquent director in the circumstances.\n\nOn 24 March 2016, the Supreme Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the Western Cape High Court declaring Mr Dines Gihwala and Mr Lancelot Manala delinquent.\n\nThis case involved the exclusion of shareholders whom the court found to have duly paid for their shares in the company\u2019s affairs as shareholders, undue payments made for the benefit of the implicated directors and failure to produce accurate financial statements.\n\nThe court, in declaring the two delinquent, had harsh words, and concluded that the conduct of the directors was calculated to enrich themselves financially.\n\nIt is noteworthy that in this case, whereas the implicated directors contended that the provision of Section 162, which empowers the courts to declare directors delinquent, was unconstitutional - because among other things, it violates their rights to freedom of trade, occupation and profession - the court took the position that it was necessary to protect investors and the general public against directors who conduct affairs of companies in a grossly negligent manner. In this case in particular, the conduct was motivated by personal financial gain.\n\nIn August 2019, the North Gauteng High Court declared delinquent the former executives of the Public Investment Corporation, who were appointed by the PIC onto the board of VBS Bank for their role in the events that lead to the demise of the bank. These directors are also alleged to have benefitted financially from the ill-gotten proceeds of VBS Bank.\n\nREAD: PIC wins court bid to have two former VBS directors declared delinquent\n\nUnderstanding the history\n\nIt is clear from these examples that the courts will be inclined to declare directors delinquent where there is demonstrable financial misconduct or flagrant disregard of the provisions of the Companies Act.\n\nSome have tried unsuccessfully to resolve boardroom differences by threatening directors with an application of delinquency. There are examples of these were the courts have rejected such and implored the directors and their stakeholders to resolve their differences through other mechanisms available in the Companies Act.\n\nAny person who seeks to declare the other a delinquent director will do well to carefully consider whether such application meet the prescripts of Section 162 of the Companies Act. Where this is not the case the courts will have no reason to use the declaration of delinquency as a measure to resolve company differences.\n\nMatodzi Ratshimbilani is an attorney and director of Tshisevhe Gwina Ratshimbilani Inc.
