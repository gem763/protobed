David W. Titley, a retired Navy officer who previously served as NOAA\u2019s chief operating officer, was even more scathing about his former agency. \u201cPerhaps the darkest day ever for @noaa leadership,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cDon\u2019t know how they will ever look their workforce in the eye again. Moral cowardice.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s continuing efforts to vindicate his assertion has proved uncomfortable or bewildering in Alabama for allies and meteorologists alike. While Mr. Trump fueled a snowballing national news story, the state\u2019s governor and members of Congress largely steered clear of the topic this week on social media, leaving it to local meteorologists to straighten out any confusion.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Trump-Alabama-Dorian.Html"], "top_image": ""}
