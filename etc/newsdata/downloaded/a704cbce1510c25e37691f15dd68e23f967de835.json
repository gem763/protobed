We do, so we started asking. Welcome to Why Is Your Skin So Good. Photo: Courtesy of Kaleigh Fasanella\n\nWant more skin care? Join our Facebook Group, the Beauty of It All.\n\nKaleigh Fasanella has had a dermatologist since she was a baby. Born with Netherton Syndrome, a rare genetic skin condition that affects 1 in 200,000 newborns, the beauty writer and editor has dealt with sensitive, dry, and red skin her whole life. \u201cThe skin condition I was born with makes it so that my skin is super, super finicky and fragile,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt can freak out (see: get really red and blotchy) for no real reason at all.\u201d Her skin condition is the reason she chose to work in the beauty industry in the first place.\n\nShe developed a full-on routine when she was 11. She remembers using a Clarisonic when she was a teen to exfoliate every single day, sometimes twice a day, because her \u201cskin turns over at a hyper-rapid rate and needs to be removed or else I\u2019ll get super flaky.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to her products, Fasanella struggles to find effective ones that are also safe for sensitive skin. Read on for the sunscreen that makes her skin look better, the oil that feels like butter, and the exfoliator that replaced her Clarisonic.\n\nQykSonic \u201cZoe\u201d $149 (was $199, now 25% off) \u201cI was gifted \u2018the Zoe\u2019 on a deskside while I was full-time at Allure. I had never tried a sonic cleansing device before, despite seeing them everywhere. For whatever reason, I thought it wouldn\u2019t do a great job at exfoliating. My face acquires quite a bit of dead skin over the course of the day, so I always need to do a pretty thorough cleanse in order to get a smooth canvas. I\u2019ve used washcloths in the past, but I low-key hate how I feel like they\u2019re always swimming in bacteria, though I\u2019m aware how dramatic that sounds. I like using a brush \u2014 and a silicone brush specifically \u2014 because the bristles are made of medical-grade, antimicrobial silicone that doesn\u2019t allow bacteria to cling to it like washcloths. I also think having the different speed settings is a nice feature because it lets you customize how gentle or aggressive you want your exfoliation to be. Other exfoliators like scrubs have been too irritating for my skin, so I think a brush could be a great option for anyone with sensitive or acne-prone skin. \u201cAnyway, this guy ended up being an amazing alternative after all. I\u2019ve been using it for roughly a year now every day, and it never irritates my skin. It does a really solid job of buffing away dead skin and leaving my complexion with that whole clean-but-not-stripped feeling. \u201d $149 at QykSonic Buy\n\nYouth to the People Superfood Antioxidant Cleanser \u201cIt sounds weird, but I can actually smell the kale in this cleanser. Even though I don\u2019t love eating it, I like the scent. This past year, I\u2019ve come to the realization that gel cleansers are ideal for my skin type because they can be deep-cleaning and gentle. I\u2019ve been testing this one for a few months now, and so far, so good. It always leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean and soft, but doesn\u2019t dry it out or make my redness worse. I also love that it\u2019s really lightweight and that it comes in a massive bottle with a pump. I love me a good pump. In addition to this one, I\u2019ve gotta shoutout iS Clinical\u2019s Cleansing Complex and Rene\u00e9 Rouleau\u2019s Moisture Protecting Cleanser, both of which are also gels and excellent at soothing sensitive skin.\u201d $36 at Sephora Buy\n\nAlgenist AA (Alguronic Acid) Barrier Serum \u201cRecently, after cleansing, I\u2019ve been slathering on a few pumps of this serum, which feels really lovely and cooling on the skin. It contains alguronic acid, which I\u2019d never heard of before but is supposed to help smooth fine lines and wrinkles, as well as niacinamide, and an antioxidant called phloretin. If my skin is ever red or inflamed after washing my face, this calms it down and minimizes the irritation almost instantly. I\u2019ve also noticed my skin has felt more hydrated since I started using it.\u201d $85 at Sephora Buy\n\nFarmacy Honey Grail Ultra-Hydrating Face Oil \u201cThis honey-colored facial oil is nothing like actual honey. It\u2019s silky, lightweight, and glides onto the skin like butter, but not in a gross way. I\u2019ve tried too many oils to count in the past year, and I can safely say this one falls under my Top Five. I also specifically love this one for the summertime because as far as oils go, it\u2019s on the thinner, slightly serum-y side, so it never makes my skin feel suffocated when it\u2019s really humid out.\u201d $48 at Sephora Buy\n\nDrunk Elephant Lala Retro\u2122 Whipped Moisturizer with Ceramides \u201cI pretty much use a thick moisturizer year-round since my skin is so parched and needs all the hydration it can get. In the winter, Weleda\u2019s Skin Food is my everything and I go through tubes of it like water, so Weleda, if you\u2019re reading this, don\u2019t even think about discontinuing it or I\u2019ll be so sad. For summer, Lala is fabulous because it\u2019s still rich and creamy but not quite as thick and aggressive (in a good way) as Skin Food. It seals everything in with a blend of ceramides and oils, and I like to think that it makes the rest of my skin care work even better.\u201d $60 at Sephora Buy\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "Writer and editor Kaleigh Fasanella was born with Netherton Syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects her skin.
