Brees also said its a possibility he could be active, but not start the Week 8 contest.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how it goes. I\u2019d love to [play]. It\u2019s a goal,\u201d Brees told ESPN.\n\nFox Sports reported that Saints expected Brees to return in Week 8, but Saints coach Sean Payton contradicted the report after the game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not even discussing it, sorry,\u201d Payton told reporters.\n\nBrees tore ligaments in his right thumb in Week 2 and hasn\u2019t played since Sept. 15. He had surgery Sept. 18 and was initially expected to miss six weeks. The future Hall of Famer posted a video of himself throwing a football Oct. 5 on Instagram. He has since appeared at Saints practices but has yet to resume full-team drills.\n\nTeddy Bridgewater has filled in nicely for Brees, completing 67.7 percent of his throws for 1,370 yards, nine scores and two interceptions since taking over. Bridgewater has won all five of his starts this season.\n\nThe Saints (6-1) host the Cardinals (3-3-1) at 1 p.m. EDT Sunday at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans.", "description": "Oct. 21 (UPI) \u2014 New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees plans to return to practice this week and called a Week 8 return a \u201cgoal\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
