We agreed that the law should change, so that members of the public would have the choice of \u2018opting out\u2019 as well as \u2018opting in\u2019 to organ donation.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t \u2018opt in\u2019 or \u2018opt out\u2019, then organ donation consent would be \u2018deemed\u2019. We felt that a law change could raise awareness, increase the number of \u2018known decisions\u2019, thus increasing the consent rate and reducing the wait for anybody of any age needing an organ transplant.\n\nWe also understood that any law change would result in a \u2018soft opt out\u2019 system, meaning that the family would still have the final say.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nWhat clinched the decision? Max also gave his blessing for the sharing of this, oh so personal, photograph.\n\nHe understood that it could help him and help others also. We knew what it felt like to have a loved one \u2018languishing\u2019, \u2018deteriorating\u2019 on \u2018death row\u2019.\n\nIt was like torture, purgatory, highly emotional, both physically and mentally draining.\n\nIf there was anything we could do to reduce this stress for others, then we were prepared to chip in.\n\nThe other big reason was a selfish one.\n\nWe felt that sharing Max\u2019s story might just strike a chord with a bereaved family and result in consent to organ donation, which might not otherwise be forthcoming.\n\nIn other words, it might just result in Max getting that precious gift.\n\nWe would do anything, if there was the slightest chance that Max would be saved.\n\nLittle did we realise how Max\u2019s story and the Mirror campaign to Change the Law for Life would snowball....Max would appear on the front page of the Mirror no fewer than 15 times over the coming months.\n\nThen the government started to listen: \u2018Hope for critically ill Max, 9, as Theresa May promises, \u201cWe are looking at organ donation law\u201d.\u2019\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nBy now, the Mirror had also set up a public petition to collect signatures: \u2018Pressure mounts on Theresa May to change organ donor laws as Mirror appeal hits 10,000 supporters.\u2019\n\nIn July, 2017 Emma attended Parliament with Max\u2019s brother Harry as MPs discussed the law change.\n\nShe described the experience as strangely surreal.\n\nIt was difficult to comprehend that the little boy being referred to was her little boy.\n\nShortly afterwards, Geoffrey Robinson presented the first reading of the \u2018Organ Donation Deemed Consent Bill\u2019.\n\nJust weeks later, she was invited to the Labour Party Conference in Brighton to be a guest speaker at one of the fringe events organised by the Mirror to promote their campaign.\n\nIn her speech, she told delegates of Max\u2019s diagnosis, adding: \u201cWe were told that our son had a 33% chance of getting better, a 33% chance of requiring a heart transplant and a 33% chance of passing away. Our world was turned upside down.\u201d\n\nThe campaign gathered pace; within weeks, Max and Emma were invited to the 50th Anniversary celebration of the first ever heart transplant which took place in South Africa, performed by Christiaan Barnard.\n\nMax delivered a PowerPoint presentation, \u2018My Heart Story\u2019, with aplomb.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nEmma was so proud of him standing up there in his electric blue suit and matching \u2018Heelys\u2019! How far he had come!\n\nIn one of Max\u2019s later interviews for BBC North West Tonight, he was asked how it feels to have a law named after him.\n\nHe looked down and quietly said, \u201cIt would be nice if the law could be called \u2018Max and Keira\u2019s Law.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe change in the law, when it comes, will also be a part of Keira\u2019s mark on the world.\n\nOn Oct 29, 2018, we stood waiting to join the red carpet which led to the Pride of Britain awards.\n\nMax had been selected as a winner of the Child of Courage category.\n\nLater, as we looked across the room towards our table at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London, we noticed the figures of Keira\u2019s parents - Joe and Loanna Ball, already seated.\n\nAs Max and Joe saw one another, they both jogged on a collision course as quickly as the table arrangement allowed, and engaged in a massive hug. They have such an amazing bond.\n\n(Image: Andy Commins / Daily Mirror)\n\nWe were delighted Joe and Loanna would be sharing this evening with us \u2013 not only was the award and law change campaign that had given rise to it a part of Keira\u2019s legacy; Max would simply not be here without the Ball family, so how lovely to have them with us for this special occasion.\n\nIn his little speech, Max acknowledged Joe and Loanna, who thus received a spontaneous standing ovation for being the true heroes they are.\n\nMax encouraged people to donate: \u201cWhy waste your organs,\u201d he said, \u201cyou could save four lives \u2013 nine lives.\u201d\n\nGolden Heart, adapted by Jeremy Armstrong; in support of Sick Children\u2019s Trust, the Children\u2019s Heart Unit Foundation and Inspired by Keira.
