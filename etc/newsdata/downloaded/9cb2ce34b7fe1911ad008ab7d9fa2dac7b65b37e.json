(AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko)\n\nPERGAMINO, Argentina (AP) \u2014 Juan Rossi walks between rows of green wheat at his farm in one of Argentina's most fertile agricultural regions, worrying about the future of the farming sector that is the main economic engine of this country.\n\nWhen he planted the wheat, he expected conservative Mauricio Macri to be reelected president of Argentina. Now, farmers like Rossi are bracing for a possible return of the interventionist policies of Macri's now-favored main rival: the presidential ticket of Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez and former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez.\n\nExport restrictions imposed during Cristina Fernandez's 2007-2015 left-of-center government triggered a revolt in 2008 by Argentina's farmers, who are among the world's top suppliers of grains. She is now running as vice president with her former aide bidding for the presidency in the Oct. 27 national elections.\n\nFears of a return of high export taxes come as agriculture seeks to rebound from one of the worst drought in years that badly damaged crops two seasons ago.\n\n\"Today, we have uncertainty about whether they'll allow us to continue as we've been doing so far, or if they're going to put a spoke in our wheel,\" Rossi said on his farm on the outskirts of the city of Pergamino, where he also grows corn and keeps chickens and peacocks. \"We're in the middle of this fog and no one knows what's going to happen.\"\n\nRossi was among a group of jubilant Argentine farmers who cheered the business-friendly Macri when he arrived in their town in the Pampas grain belt in 2015 to announce that he would scrap taxes on exports of corn and wheat to jumpstart the economy.\n\nIt was a moment of victory for Macri, who had recently taken office, and of hope for farmers, who had been hobbled by the strict export limits imposed by the previous government. Since then, it has only been ups and downs.\n\nRossi says improved weather gave them some \"oxygen\" for this year's harvest. But then Macri surprisingly turned in a worse showing in primary elections than the left-leaning Peronist candidate Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, causing stocks to plunge and the peso to depreciate even further in recession-hit Argentina, which has been struggling with rapidly rising prices and increasing poverty.\n\nThe primary results also coincided with a report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture that lowered estimates for Argentina's soy and corn crops based on weather conditions, said Esteban Copati, head of agricultural forecasts at the Buenos Aires grains exchange.\n\n\"There was a double whammy,\" Copati said. \"On the one side, there was this change in the political scenario that changed the intention of growers to plant since they started to become fearful of what the policies of this new government could be. And on the other hand, there was the impact of the drop in international prices.\"\n\nFarmers and ranchers say they don't want a return to restrictions that in 2008 led them to block goods from reaching Argentine cities, causing severe shortages of beef and produce. Unmoved goods rotted and supermarket shelves were bare in many regions.\n\nThe three-week strike over export taxes became one of the biggest crises of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez's presidency. She said the taxes were aimed at redistributing the riches from the agricultural sector in a country where many are poor.\n\nFarming leaders have met with Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, who served as chief of staff during a portion of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez's first term as president but left in 2008 following the conflict. The two are not related.\n\nFarmers said the candidate asked them to turn the page at the recent meeting. He later told reporters that the session marked the \"beginning of a good, fruitful bond.\"\n\nThe farming sector is a major source of foreign currency for Argentina and the next administration will be eager to count on bringing in those reserves to avert a debt default and a further deepening of a currency crisis.\n\nMany Argentines are increasingly frustrated by the sputtering economy, rising poverty and austerity measures. Some analysts say that Macri's administration set overly optimistic goals and that a decision by the central bank to hike the inflation target caused investors to begin doubting Macri's commitment to taming price rises. Macri's government was forced to strike a record $56 billion bailout loan with the International Monetary Fund following a sharp depreciation of the peso against the U.S. dollar last year.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Juan Rossi walks between rows of green wheat at his farm in one of Argentina's most fertile agricultural regions, worrying about the future of the farming sector that is the main economic engine of this country.
