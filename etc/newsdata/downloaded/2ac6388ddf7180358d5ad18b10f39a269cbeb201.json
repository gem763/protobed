Max can't go anywhere yet. After that, it will be a difficult choice, because you simply cannot see into the future,\" Doornbos told Ziggo Sport.\n\n\"Max actually has the choice of two other teams, or three if you include McLaren. They've done extremely well and can become a serious team when they go to Mercedes engines.\n\n\"One thing is for sure and that is that Mercedes will not continue to dominate Formula 1 for another four years.\"\n\n'He will make his choice quickly'\n\nHowever, Doornbos thinks it is possible that Red Bull-Honda will succeed in retaining Verstappen beyond 2020.\n\n\"It's important for them to develop that car as well as possible next winter,\" he said.\n\n\"Max wants to see a good car next year if he is going to be convinced to stay. Max will be able to tell what kind of car he has after one or two race weekends.\n\n\"Based on that, he will make his choice quickly.\"\n\nVerstappen, 22, is hopeful Red Bull-Honda can step up to the top two teams in 2020.\n\n\"We already have many ideas for next year about how we can make ourselves stronger,\" he said.\n\n\"Some things have worked well this year, some a little less, but there are always things that could be better. I always try to analyse everything that could be improved.\n\n\"I think we know what went wrong this year and have taken measures for next year, so we are going to find out,\" Verstappen added.", "description": "Max Verstappen will know within \"one or two\" races next year if he will stay at Red Bull in 2021, according to former Red Bull driver Robert Doornbos.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6516/d2261d67a0b74d0b8f2becb2556a577b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
