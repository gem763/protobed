The regulator announced it was considering an investigation after the government fast-tracked the Insolvency Service\u2019s investigation into the collapse of the 178-year-old travel firm.\n\nThomas Cook\u2019s auditor is EY, which took over from PwC in 2017. Both are among the UK\u2019s so-called \u201cbig four\u201d accountancy firms. The tour operator has had a series of finance chiefs over the past two years as its problems deepened.\n\nQ&A Why did Thomas Cook collapse? Show Hide Brexit\n\n\u201cThere is now little doubt that the Brexit process has led many UK customers to delay their holiday plans for this summer,\u201d said the chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, in May. But it cannot be the whole story - arch-rival Tui has coped because its finances are healthier. Weather\n\nThe summer heatwave of 2018 encouraged would-be holidaymakers to stay at home, undermining prices in the \u201clates\u201d market where operators try to clear unsold holidays. There seems to have been a hangover into 2019, with customers calculating that waiting to book is a productive strategy. Competition\n\nA pincer movement of Airbnb and budget holidays has changed consumer behaviour, though Thomas Cook still managed to sell 11m package holidays last year. Banks and debt\n\nThe tour operator has been attempting to shoulder a huge pile of debt for the past decade \u2013 \u00a31.7bn worth at the last count. Successive managements failed to remove meaningful chunks. The banks argue they have supported an overstretched company for years and the details of why it could not be saved may have to await the report from the Insolvency Service. Bad management\n\nThomas Cook\u2019s borrowings were too high. The moral of the tale is that tour operators should fund themselves conservatively. If your balance sheet is fragile, you are at the mercy of events in an industry where most of the cash arrives in the summer and then flows out in the winter. Nils Pratley, financial editor\n\nSten Daugaard took over as chief financial officer in September 2018 from Bill Scott, who quit after less than a year in the job when Thomas Cook published a profit warning. Scott replaced Michael Healy in January 2018 when Healy stepped down after five years in the job.\n\nThe FRC said: \u201cIn light of recent developments at Thomas Cook we are considering whether there is any case for investigation and enforcement action as a matter of urgency and in cooperation with the Insolvency Service.\u201d\n\nThomas Cook collapsed on Monday after failing to secure a funding lifeline, placing 9,000 UK jobs at risk and leaving 150,000 British holidaymakers stranded abroad. The government has launched the biggest peacetime repatriation of UK citizens.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nIn May, the company reported a \u00a31.5bn first-half loss and published its third profit warning in less than a year. It had \u00a31.2bn of debt and was forced to write down the value of its MyTravel UK package holiday business by \u00a31.1bn.\n\nOn its website, the FRC said: \u201cThe FRC\u2019s remit oversees accountants and accounting firms who are members of one of the professional bodies which we oversee.\n\n\u201cThe enforcement division conducts investigations and can bring prosecutions, if appropriate, against auditors, accountants, accountancy firms, and actuaries where there appears to be misconduct or a breach of the relevant professional standards.\u201d", "description": "Financial Reporting Council has power to impose penalties in event of irregularities", "authors": ["Sean Farrell", "Nils Pratley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a37381b5130ea794787a1074b29259d8b138a34/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e0f9f2e96cce12016311c6906b81ca39", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
