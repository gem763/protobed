They\u2019re not my weight, I\u2019m the world champion\u2019.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re never going to be world champions but they bring in a whole new audience \u2013 whether they\u2019re going to get turned on by boxing or not I\u2019ve no idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exposure, if not then oh well, nothing lost.\n\n\u201cWhen Billy goes into the arena, in his mind he\u2019s the main attraction. They aren\u2019t proper fighters, they\u2019re on the first step of the ladder.\n\nThey have got a big fan base, there\u2019s obviously demand for it.\u201d\n\nSaunders\u2019 opponent has yet to be announced and is expected to be a routine defence before facing the likes of Callum Smith in 2020.", "description": "Billy Joe Saunders \u2018laughed\u2019 when he found out he was going to be on the undercard of KSI vs Logan Paul, his trainer Dominic Ingle has revealed.
