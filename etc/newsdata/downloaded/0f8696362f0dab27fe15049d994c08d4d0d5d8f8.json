Because the flag industry is so driven by world events, Ms. Goglio says, the decisions Eder makes aren\u2019t only about business. \u201cIt can sometimes be what\u2019s right for the emotional aspect \u2014 of not just the people that work here, but for the citizens.\u201d\n\nSome of the feedback was positive, she says, \u201cbut there was such hatred in there. I will never forget that, ever. Ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cI took that brunt for the company,\u201d says Ms. Goglio, a sweet white woman with a gray and white bob. \u201cIt was a brutal couple of weeks.\u201d\n\nJodi Goglio, the chief operating officer of Eder, says that the money was less important the fact that as a wholesaler, she doesn\u2019t know where the flags will end up. Or, put another way, Eder doesn\u2019t ever want to find out that one of its flags was tacked to a mass shooter\u2019s bedroom wall.\n\nThe company makes historical flags, too \u2014 all 27 official versions of the stars and stripes and a line of replicas that span North American history. In 2015, after the mass shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., left nine people dead, Eder Flag stopped manufacturing the ubiquitous Virginia Infantry flag that is widely mistaken for the official flag of the Confederate States of America. The company did it within days, not months, destroying the extant stock at a considerable financial loss. (Eder continues to produce other Civil War-era flags, including Robert E. Lee\u2019s battle flag.)\n\nEder also makes state flags, municipal flags, military flags, international flags and commemorative banners of all kinds. All of these, as well as the flagpole inventory, are produced in the company\u2019s main office building. The American flags are produced across the street, in a cavernous workroom with sewing machines, industrial equipment and ceiling-high shelves stacked with cakes.\n\nIt\u2019s so big that the people handling the flag can\u2019t help stepping on it, which drives commenters nuts whenever they see photos or video on local news. The stars are bigger than my hand. The stripes are 28 inches wide. This is one of the five million United States flags that Eder Flag will manufacture in 2019. Eder, the largest producer of American flags and flagpoles, is one of only five companies that have received a \u201cMade in the U.S.A.\u201d certification from the Flag Manufacturers Association of America.\n\nThis flag is so big that it takes 10 people to unfurl it across the floor of the production room, and even then it\u2019s a tight squeeze.\n\nWe drove from Milwaukee, Wis., to Kansas City, Mo., stopping along the way to talk to people about civic duty, national pride and the symbols often used as stand-ins for Americanness.\n\nThat the immigration process is complex and arduous, and maybe even unfairly so, isn\u2019t lost on people. Outside the courthouse, Sandy Weitz, down from Oshkosh with a group of friends to celebrate the naturalization of a friend\u2019s friend\u2019s wife, tells me that the man she sat next to went through the ringer to bring his wife here. Sixty thousand dollars and three separate trips to Vietnam, can you believe that? The hoops they put him through! I ask her if it helps her understand the critique that \u201cwaiting in line\u201d is an inadequate solution. No, she says, shrugging. That\u2019s just the way the system is.\n\nBecoming a citizen changes people\u2019s lives. It also doesn\u2019t. Any one of these new Americans might leave the courthouse and be told to go back to where they came from. It won\u2019t matter to many of their neighbors that the dozen new Mexican-American citizens are the ones who \u201cwaited in line,\u201d who \u201cdid it right.\u201d I say this to my press escort from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services regional office. She shrugs. \u201cSomeone could tell me to go back to where I came from, too,\u201d she says. She\u2019s often mistaken for non-white.\n\n\u201cWhere is Benin?\u201d Judge Adelman says. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 on the west side of Africa,\u201d the man from Benin responds, and a laugh ripples through the room. A woman in a yellow cardigan, who had nodded to herself as Judge Adelman stressed the importance of voting, is from India. We could have a conversation about what\u2019s happening in Kashmir, the contested Indian state, Judge Adelman says, but we\u2019ll set it aside for now. A dozen people from Mexico raise their hands. Sudan, a woman in a pretty blouse with a butterfly pattern, responds with a raised arm and a loud \u201chere,\u201d a smile in her voice.\n\nToday, 4,242 people across the country are becoming U.S. citizens. In this Milwaukee courtroom, Judge Lynn S. Adelman is presiding over the naturalizations of 72 people from 31 countries, and he begins with a roll call of the assembled nations.\n\nThere are two kinds of naturalization ceremonies, judicial and administrative \u2014 the difference is like having a courthouse wedding versus planning your own \u2014 but regardless they\u2019re all different. Each judge has complete control over the ceremonies in their courtroom. They can seize their bully pulpit or stick to the essentials, extemporize about freedom or voting or their personal political leanings.\n\nWhy exactly the White House is upside down is revealed halfway through, when you walk into a room with a diorama of scientists performing surgery on an alien. You can fill in the rest.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t really Donald Trump,\u201d a kid in a blue shirt says, more than once, \u201cthere\u2019s only half a body.\u201d Another kid points to a cutout and says to his brother, \u201cIs that Hillary Clinton?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d the brother says scornfully. \u201cThat\u2019s Barack Obama. Hillary Clinton was never even president.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s what you think it is: the White House, upside down. The first room you enter, after having your picture taken, is empty, except for some presidential cardboard cutouts glued to the walls and an animatronic Donald Trump fortune teller machine.\n\nWe\u2019re going to the Top Secret Inc. Upside Down White House. The digital sign says admission is $5, today only, but I suspect the sign says that every day.\n\nTop Secret Inc. Upside Down White House in Wisconsin Dells, Wis. (There are two other unrelated upside-down White Houses in the U.S., one in Tennessee and another in Florida.)\n\nDriving through southern Wisconsin, we make a detour to Wisconsin Dells, a summer resort town. It\u2019s like a verdant Vegas, with many weird buildings and places of interest, including a sprawling Mount Olympus-themed resort. In front of one gas station, there\u2019s a human-size Statue of Liberty.\n\nEvery year, the Hobo Foundation of Britt hosts the National Hobo Convention, a celebration of itinerant workers. Barricades keep traffic from interfering with the festivities on Main Avenue.\n\n\u201cIf we live in fear, what good is faith?\u201d he says. \u201cWe are a community of faith. That creates safety in our hearts. The moment we start having fear in our hearts and live in fear is the moment we lose our faith.\u201d\n\nImam Selim also thinks that the city\u2019s low unemployment and economic stability make it \u201can excellent place for any minority community to thrive,\u201d because those factors reduce the economic anxiety that can breed fear of difference.\n\nImam Selim, 31, has led the mosque since he and his American-born wife came to Cedar Rapids from Egypt seven years ago, spurred in part by the trauma of witnessing the violent chaos of the Egyptian Revolution. He is conscientious and kind, patient with our questions even though he\u2019s worn out. Cedar Rapids has been good to him and his family. People are welcoming. The city is home to one of the oldest Muslim communities in the United States.\n\nHe\u2019s meeting with a congregant named Matt, a composed, observant white man with a bushy reddish beard. He, too, wears a prayer cap, with a white tunic and pants. A convert to Islam who observes strict modesty rules, he declines to shake my hand.\n\nHis desk is cluttered, and boxes are piled in one corner. Perched atop a tall bookshelf is his new diploma; he completed a bachelor\u2019s degree in world religions at nearby Coe College. Later, he\u2019ll replace his kufi with a baseball cap and the tunic with the pale pink blazer hanging from the back of his padded chair.\n\nOn this hot, bright Friday afternoon, the doors of the Islamic Center of Cedar Rapids are propped open. It\u2019s just after Jumu\u2019ah, the Friday afternoon prayer. Imam Hassan Selim is in his office, still dressed in the loose white tunic he wears to pray.\n\nWhy do so many Native Americans serve a country that for so long excluded them? It\u2019s simple, one woman says: \u201cThis is our land.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Veterans Day at the powwow, with dances for each branch of the armed forces, including the reserves and National Guard, but vets have pride of place throughout the weekend. Members of the settlement\u2019s American Legion post raise and lower the flags and lead the twice-daily Grand Entry into the arena. The traditional Pipe Dance and Victory Dance, which began after World War I, honor their sacrifices. The tribe has more than 250 veterans of the U.S. military. During World War II, eight men and women served as code talkers, using the Meskwaki language to transmit tactical radio orders.\n\nPowwows like these are complicated. They\u2019re modern social events that began in the wake of decades of federal suppression of indigenous rituals, both expressions of defiance to assimilation and intercultural commercial entities. In 1923, when the Bureau of Indian Affairs issued a statement warning tribes against holding powwows or dances, the Meskwaki threw the biggest one yet and invited all of their white neighbors. The event attracted more than 12,000 people over four days.\n\nThe several styles of competitive powwow dance are denoted partly by the performers\u2019 regalia. Grass dancers, for example, wear ribbons and fringe across the span of their shirts and down their pants and dresses. There are also a handful of traditional dances, which originated throughout Indian Country. At the Meskwaki History Museum tent, Suzanne Buffalo proudly explains that tribes act as sacred custodians of other nations\u2019 dances: The Meskwaki have long performed the Shawnee Dance, which was a gift from that tribe.\n\nIn the days leading up to the powwow, loss has shaken the community. Two women have died, one an elder, the other a young woman who left behind a daughter. The M.C. calls for a blanket dance to raise money for their families. Someone spreads out a blanket woven in rich purples and bright oranges, and dancers and visitors cover it with bills and coins. People give generously, lots of fives and 20s. A little kid who won $5 in a Tiny Tots dance comes over and adds his prize to the pile.\n\nThe Meskwaki Nation, formally the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa, is the only federally recognized tribe in the state. Their 8,000-acre settlement is a sovereign nation, not a federally designated reservation; the tribe bought the first 80 acres in 1857. The tribe has more than 1,400 enrolled members.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a young lady all the way from Hangzhou, China,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s her first time seeing real Indians, she says.\u201d Mr. Yazzie, a Meskwaki and professional Fancy Dancer, returns to the settlement from his home in Minnesota for the powwow each year. People chat and catch up. Most leave their phones in purses or pockets. There\u2019s funnel cake and fry bread tacos. This is the 105th Meskwaki Powwow.\n\nMost are dressed casually, in T-shirts and baseball caps: Their voices are their sacred wardrobe. The women who sing with them stand in a semicircle behind them. Everywhere, women and girls in heavy jingle dresses bring the sounds of the bells with them as they pad in and out of the arena and visit friends in the bleachers. Every so often, the M.C. Larry Yazzie welcomes visitors from other tribal nations, U.S. states, and countries.\n\nBleachers line three sides of the arena. A covered pavilion and speaker stand forms the fourth, sheltering elders and dancers resting between songs. The singers, all men, sit in front of the pavilion in their drum groups \u2014 Eagle Feather, Meskwaki Nation \u2014 each ensemble crowded around an enormous brass drum with a microphone suspended over the drumhead.\n\nThere are lots of confrontational T-shirts at the fair, their messages unprintable here. And then there are the Slipknot fans, dressed in tees that pledge their allegiance to heavy metal. The band is in Des Moines for its first hometown show in years. Obviously there\u2019s a mosh pit.\n\nThe Iowa State Fair is one of the largest state fairs in the country, drawing more than a million visitors, including many presidential primary candidates.\n\nHe also believes there is a secular redemptive narrative that can heal political division in this country. \u201cWhat we have to keep saying over and over again is that America is an idea,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a people. It\u2019s the idea of bringing people from all over the world together to live prosperous and generous lives.\u201d Obviously it hasn\u2019t happened, not yet. \u201cWe haven\u2019t realized that dream,\u201d he says, \u201cbut in general, we get closer and closer.\u201d Just this morning he heard Cory Booker say so.\n\nBoth men believe that the problem facing Democrats is one of messaging and competing ideology. Mr. Leonard says that conservatives have cast political difference in the Biblical terms of original sin. \u201cRepublicans know people are born bad and redeemed by their faith in Jesus,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen somebody does something bad, it\u2019s because the person made a bad decision. Democrats think people are born good. Something bad happened to them. And so we have to blame society.\u201d\n\nHe cuts the genial figure of an old-time newspaperman: suspenders holding up khaki pants, notebook in hand, bag of recording gear slung over his shoulder. It\u2019s true in temperament, but this is his second career, third if you count his stint driving a cab while teaching anthropology at the University of New Mexico. When he came home to Iowa in the mid-2000s, he became a radio journalist and news director for a pair of rural stations south of Des Moines. Since the presidential election, he\u2019s published half a dozen opinion articles in The New York Times, Salon and other publications. CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter has called him a \u201cTrumpland translator.\u201d Last year, Mr. Leonard began asking Mr. Russell to write Times opinion articles with him.\n\nPeople come in and out of the house throughout the afternoon, many of them helping prepare the place for Ms. Harris and her event. Mr. Russell is waiting for his friend Bob Leonard, a local journalist, to arrive.\n\nWe sit and talk, and the couple\u2019s hospitality unspools with the hours. There\u2019s fresh coffee, a tray of crackers and some hummus and a beautiful bowl of heirloom tomatoes and, later, an enormous block of sharp white Cheddar cheese. Two shaggy, well-loved farm dogs wander around, nosing our arms and elbows until we scratch their heads. P-Dog a black dog with patches of brindled fur on her belly and legs, entices visitors to indulge her bad behavior. One, two, three times she\u2019s shooed away to flop, sulking, on the big armchair or to duck through the doggie door into the rain.\n\nThey were, he says, shellshocked. When he went back the next day to do some paperwork, the school superintendent\u2019s assistant told him, \u201cI wanted to hug you last night. I went home and cried. Everybody has tried to figure out what to do for these boys.\u201d It took outsiders to make change happen. \u201cThese two teenage boys asked us to be their parents,\u201d Mr. Russell says, with a hint of lingering disbelief and an abundance of pleasure.\n\nMr. Russell remembers the first time he picked Devon up at school after a temporary guardianship went through, how Devon danced in the parking lot when he learned that Coyote Run Farm really had become home. The boys hadn\u2019t told anyone at the high school about any of this \u2014 the office staff had never met Mr. Russell before.\n\n\u201cThis is Austin,\u201d Mr. Russell says, stretching one long arm to point to a basic-training portrait of a young guy tacked to a mirror behind him, his wrist slipping out from his buttoned cuff. I knew very little about Mr. Russell when I contacted him \u2014 just that he\u2019s a gay farmer \u2014 but his is also the story of a new American family that carved itself a place in rural Iowa. As they got to know the boys, he tells me, their farm became a refuge from a difficult home life. They let the boys decide when and what to tell, but what they learned was \u201cdysfunctional, really horrific.\u201d The couple had resources to help them figure out how to change their situation \u2014 not just money, but connections at Drake Law School. Eventually, and of their own volition, two of the boys asked the couple to become their legal guardians.\n\nThey have mules, horses and turkeys. They invite friends and customers to come learn to butcher chickens. Mr. Russell\u2019s siblings and cousins have worked on the farm, and in the summers they hire a gaggle of local boys as farmhands, for whom Mr. Standley prepares huge lunches every day.\n\nHe and his husband, Patrick Standley, have owned this 110-acre sustainable farm since 2005. It\u2019s a retail agriculture operation that uses sustainable agriculture practices to produce chemical-free produce and hormone-free beef, chicken and eggs, which they sell at farmers\u2019 markets and to restaurateurs. They also accept vouchers from the federal W.I.C. nutrition program, which provides nutritious food for low-income women and children.\n\nThe solution they have to offer involves policy planners parachuting in to save American agriculture from itself. Mr. Russell says that American farmers are in the best position to respond quickly to the climate crisis. \u201cNot agribusiness, not the oil companies, not the food retailers,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cFarmers.\u201d\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats treat farmers as victims, Mr. Russell says. Republicans flatly refuse to address the problem of climate change but address farmers as wounded heroes, unappreciated and undervalued. \u201cAnd the Democratic message,\u201d Mr. Russell says, \u201cis, \u2018You guys are all committing suicide.\u2019\u201d\n\nA fifth-generation farmer with a master\u2019s degree in rural sociology, Mr. Russell, who is 49, has been working on issues of economic and environmental sustainability in agriculture for nearly two decades. Led by his religious faith, he has spent his life teaching, organizing and preaching. Over the past couple of years, he has taken an increasingly public role in organizing farmers to drive climate change policy in industrial agriculture.\n\nMatt Russell comes outside to meet us in rubber boots and his Sunday best, a blue plaid shirt tucked neatly into belted jeans. He\u2019s used to visitors: Beto O\u2019Rourke and Tim Ryan have been here, reporters too. Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign staffers are staging the barn for her visit this afternoon. All of them want to talk to Mr. Russell about climate change.\n\nWe arrive at Coyote Run Farm late on a Sunday morning, the sky the kind of gray that makes every plant and flower look more alive.\n\nWhen the freshmen enter the school and head for the gym, there\u2019s a gantlet of icebreakers: Walk through a tunnel of smiling teachers and upperclassmen, screaming and waving their hands in front of your face; massage your neighbor\u2019s shoulders; she-says-Lincoln-you-say-High; volunteer to pop balloons as fast as you can. Move your body, feel feelings \u2014 though not too much, or too many.\n\nAbout 6 percent of the students in the Lincoln public school system are refugees or immigrants. At Lincoln High, students come from more than 50 countries and speak more than 30 different languages at home.\n\nIt\u2019s the first day of ninth grade at Lincoln High School, the largest and most diverse in this city of nearly 300,000. Since the arrival of Vietnamese refugees after the fall of Saigon in 1975, Lincoln has been among the country\u2019s friendliest cities for refugee resettlement. The city is home to the largest Yazidi community in the country. (The Yazidis are a Kurdish minority who were driven out of Syria and Iraq by genocide at the hands of the Islamic State.)\n\nEveryone likes everyone else today, even if they don\u2019t like themselves. The ninth grade cheer squad takes the floor, leggy foals who mostly can\u2019t tumble yet \u2014 one girl handsprings to the center of the gym and everyone else trots after her. The dance team is bigger and less nervous, though here, too, they open with the one kid, the only boy, who can drop into a split. None of the kids in the stands know the rhythms of \u201cGet Ur Freak On.\u201d\n\nThe sun is burning off the last of the humidity from last night\u2019s thunderstorm and they\u2019re all nerves, lots of thousand-yard stares, lots of clowning. The adults are rattled, too \u2014 old bodily memories, but affection and tenderness, too, for who they are and who they\u2019ll become and for what they\u2019ll face. The seniors, who run the orientation, are immune to it.\n\nTeenagers \u2014 when they\u2019re in big groups, like the 600 freshmen swarming the front steps of Lincoln High School \u2014 don\u2019t see adults, just each other. Everyone\u2019s wearing whatever they think their first day best is.\n\nThe county Democratic Party folks have pads of sample ballots so they can explain ranked-choice voting. Kansas is traditionally a caucus state, but the state party has decided to adopt ranked-choice ballots for the May 2020 primary. (The Kansas G.O.P. may not have a primary at all.) Raymond Rogers, tabling for the group, says he\u2019s excited to see how it goes. He\u2019s a jolly white man with wire-rimmed glasses, about six inches of gray and white beard, and the kind of belly that suggests a life of good eating and drinking. He lets me cast a ballot, though I don\u2019t want to taint the results. He tells me I should read \u201cPrairyErth,\u201d by William Least-Heat Moon, and writes the title on the back of a ballot so I won\u2019t forget.\n\nInside a handsome, recently renovated recreational building, community groups and small businesses are tabling. Representatives from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are giving away water safety swag, and a woman from Flint Hills Technical College is touting the school\u2019s new robotics program. A local insurance agent is raffling off a side of beef.\n\nAn older white man in an immaculate cowboy hat walks by and says, conversationally, \u201cGary\u2019s going to pull it straight through to the beef barn.\u201d That\u2019s not exactly what happens, but Gary Watts still wins in the 3,000-pound weight class. An orange tractor shudders into silence just before Nate Myers is about to hook it to the load. A half dozen men watch him crank it and cheer when it roars back to life. \u201cIt\u2019s only a hundred years old,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes she needs a little lovin\u2019.\u201d It dies again, and someone says, \u201cLooks like Nate spent too much time working on everybody else\u2019s tractor and not his own.\u201d\n\nThree nights before the Lyon County Fair closes, there\u2019s no gate fee; the place is packed with children begging their parents to buy more tickets for the dozen or so rides. In the arena, the antique tractors take a lap around the track so we can get a look at them all before the tractor pull starts. (There are three different tractor pulls during the 11-day fair.)\n\nOutside Good\u2019s Cash Saver, a grocery store that sells everything at the wholesale price plus 10 percent, I see a woman wearing a T-shirt that says \u201cI Survived Cambodia.\u201d\n\nAgricultural processing plants typically rely on immigrant and refugee labor, especially for difficult and dangerous jobs on slaughterhouse floors. About 10 years ago, when residents were hostile to a group of 400 Somali refugees Tyson had brought in, the company relocated the workers to a facility 279 miles west. The company also closed the slaughterhouse at the Emporia facility, which cost the community 1,500 jobs, though Tyson attributed the move to industry overproduction.\n\nDowntown, a civic group has recently installed wireless speakers that broadcast music from a local radio station. Family Video, the last video rental chain standing, has a store here. In May, the company introduced CBD and hemp products in all of its locations, generating some competition for the CBD store across the street. The city\u2019s economy is also anchored by a Hostess bakery, a state university, a two-year technical college and a Tyson meatpacking plant.\n\nEmporia, Kan., has followed the Main Street revitalization plan that has swept distressed urban neighborhoods and rural towns alike. There\u2019s a craft brewery, a bike shop, a remodeled movie palace turned concert hall, a monthly art walk and a farmers\u2019 market, one more likely to be attended by actual farmers than in some other locales.\n\nKansas City, Mo.\n\nThe guys start rolling up to City Park around 5:30 p.m., some straight from work. Eddie Diaz is a cabinetmaker. Vinny Aguirre drives for UPS. Bubba Hernandez is a package handler for FedEx. Rob Olvera is a union forklift operator. They get changed in the parking lot or drop their bags by the backstop and pull on team T-shirts or jerseys, rusty orange or black for the Indios, navy or red for the Bravos.\n\nThese guys grew up together and now they play ball together, just like their dads and their grandpas before them. All their kids play on the tee ball and football and Little League teams their dads coach. Tonight Louie Vaca\u2019s daughter is running around with Mr. Diaz\u2019s kids. Their dads have come out to throw some balls before the teams leave for the amateur fast-pitch world series in the morning.\n\nFast-pitch softball is a family tradition among some Mexican-Americans in the Midwest.\n\nThe Bravos and Indios are part of a circuit of Mexican-American fast-pitch softball teams, established in the central U.S. in the 1930s and \u201940s, when the game was among the most popular amateur sports in the country. Banned from segregated recreation clubs and later discouraged from playing in mostly white Amateur Softball Association tournaments, Mexican-Americans founded their own, traveling for matches in Texas, Missouri, Kansas, Illinois, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Colorado \u2014 the Midwest and Plains states where Mexican immigrants had found jobs in agriculture and shipping in the years before World War I. The Newton Mexican-American Athletic Club hosted the first Mexican-American tournament in 1946. July marked its 71st year. The game has been a multigenerational anchor for Latino communities across the region ever since. In Kansas City, Mo., the teams are dynasties, complete with beefs folks have been tending for decades. Mr. Hernandez is the third generation of one of the game\u2019s ruling families. His grandfather Paul Sr., known as Waxie, was a star player for the Aztecas before becoming the legendary coach of the Amigos. Paul Jr. pitched and then coached for the Amigos, too. Mr. Vaca's grandfather was also an Azteca, and his dad was an Amigo.\n\nVinny Aguirre, the Bravos coach and founder.\n\nMr. Aguirre has a big smile and a big tattoo of Jesus on his forearm. It\u2019s been a good season for the Bravos, he tells me. We\u2019re standing side by side in right field, watching guys tossing balls around in pairs. They\u2019re 3-2, and \u201cthe only thing that\u2019s beat us this year is the rain,\u201d he says. Mr. Aguirre happened to play baseball as a kid, but now he\u2019s a steward of fast pitch softball. In 2015, hoping to help keep the sport alive in Kansas City, Mr. Aguirre revived the Bravos, his dad\u2019s old team, and organized a new annual tournament. Now people come to Kansas City for the Indios\u2019 tournament in June and for theirs in July. One of their pitchers is a guy who\u2019s up from Argentina for the summer on a tourist visa. He started 15 games over the season, but not at N.M.A.A.C. The tournament requires that your pitcher is Mexican-American. Gabby Melendez took pitching duties and a tournament M.V.P. award for the second year in a row. Mr. Diaz goes back and forth from practicing to coaching his son, also named Eddie, who is 7 and good at every sport he plays. The guys shout advice; Mariano does some batting practice with him. Little Eddie\u2019s bright future aside, they do worry about the future of Mexican-American fast pitch. In July, a major Texas tournament celebrated its 70th, and final, year. The guys in their 20s seem to prefer video games. The women\u2019s leagues are defunct, and these days boys play baseball. It\u2019s too bad: In this atmosphere of heightened anti-Mexican rhetoric, they need the community the sport creates more than ever. I say so when I\u2019m chatting with Mr. Olvera on the sidelines. He agrees. \u201cThe one benefit of all the negativity is that it\u2019s brought us guys closer. This field, it\u2019s our safe place.\u201d They try not to dwell, but the politics do intrude. Once, Mr. Aguirre says, one of their guys, a pitcher from Mexico, was on the mound when he received a phone call informing him that his wife and children were in ICE custody in Texas. The sun\u2019s slipping away, the kids need to get to bed, and Mr. Aguirre\u2019s shift starts soon. He won\u2019t be at the tournament this weekend \u2014 he\u2019s already missed too much work this summer. Sincere but self-conscious, he tries a pregame pep talk. \u201cI almost wish they\u2019d lose,\u201d he says. Almost. They\u2019re still teasing each other as everyone packs up to head out. \u201cI used to be a softball player, but now I\u2019m a family man,\u201d Mr. Hernandez says \u2014 a toddler and a newborn and Jamie, his very patient weekend softball widow. (He did skip a tournament the weekend the baby was born.) \u201cThey\u2019re always saying they want the old Bubba back.\u201d Everyone laughs. \u201cNo one\u2019s been saying that,\u201d Mr. Olvera says. If they have, they\u2019d never tell.\n\nArmy recruiters in Kansas City, Mo.\n\nThe houses are painted in pigments that recall the American Revolution, the Prussian blue, vermillion and slate conjured in scenes of Paul Revere or Samuel Adams hustling to and from dim, conspiratorial taverns in a Boston winter.\n\nHouses in Veterans\u2019 Village, a transitional housing program for homeless veterans.\n\nThey form something like a little Levittown, rows of houses differentiated by an architectural detail or two and set along curving cement sidewalks, or a Pacific Northwest subdivision for tiny-home-dwelling hipsters, picked up whole and set down on Troost Avenue in Kansas City. Veterans\u2019 Village is a transitional housing program for homeless veterans. Bryan Meyer, a founder, claps his hands. \u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d he says, with the affect of a football coach or, you know, a former Marine. \u201cLet\u2019s take a walk.\u201d The houses, which are either 240 or 360 square feet, are the size of the tiny apartments New Yorkers pay thousands for. The project received national press when Brandonn Mixon, also a founder, appeared on Netflix\u2019s \u201cQueer Eye\u201d earlier this year; the presidential primary candidate and veteran Pete Buttegieg visited the site in July. A new community center, scheduled to open this fall, will include a computer lab, a barbershop and a veterinary clinic. Homeless pet owners often decline emergency shelters and transitional housing accommodations that don\u2019t allow animals. Here, pets are welcome. The scale model in the Veterans Community Project office even has a dog figurine standing outside the door.\n\nModel of a Veterans\u2019 Village home.", "description": "A year before the election, we spoke to people in the Midwest about all kinds of American pride.", "authors": ["Photographs Daniel Arnold", "Text Jacqui Shine"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/03/fashion/ROADTRIP-PATRIOTISM-WISCONSIN-08/ROADTRIP-PATRIOTISM-WISCONSIN-08-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
