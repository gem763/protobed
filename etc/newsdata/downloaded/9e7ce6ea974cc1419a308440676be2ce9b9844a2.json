Watching the Roy family snipe at each other aboard a luxury yacht so grand it made the ships on Below Deck look like rickety, old boats would have been dramatic enough, but \u201cThis Is Not for Tears\u201d ramped up the stakes to become one of the best hours of an already stellar season.\n\nIn an episode chock-full of memorable moments, there\u2019s one detail that piqued my interest. Not Kendall\u2019s shocking public betrayal of his father, nor Connor casually asking his dad for a $100 million because his girlfriend\u2019s Broadway play bombed, but rather Siobhan Roy lying on the beach reading Sally Rooney\u2019s brilliant 2017 novel Conversations With Friends.\n\nSymbolically, it makes sense that Succession\u2019s writers would give Shiv this particular book during a scene in which she and her husband, Tom, are discussing the openness of their marriage. Tom is directly questioning whether they should even stick together, and Conversations With Friends is, in large part, about a young woman having an affair with an older man who\u2019s stuck in a complicated marriage. As readers, we\u2019re often drawn to books that can explain or guide our own experiences. Lord knows Shiv and Tom\u2019s relationship needs a life raft after the threesome debacle, but if I\u2019m being honest about a book I love deeply, Shiv would hate it.\n\nConversations With Friends is told through Frances, a 21-year-old English student and poet in Dublin with a propensity for long bouts of ennui who becomes intimately entwined in a wealthy couple\u2019s life. It\u2019s both critically and publicly acclaimed, so why would Shiv feel otherwise? First, there\u2019s the money factor. Frances self-identifies as a Marxist, having little desire for money beyond the basic necessities. She\u2019s morbidly fascinated by the lives of her new wealthy cohort, but openly judges their bourgeois lifestyle. I can\u2019t imagine Shiv would appreciate a class-motivated guilt trip while on a luxurious trip that cost millions of dollars.\n\nPerhaps more important than Frances\u2019s feelings on money is that she lacks ambition. That puts her in stark contrast to any member of the Roy family, but especially Shiv, who\u2019s spent the entire season trying to needle her way into a position of power. To so many readers, Frances is a deeply compelling character full of self-doubt and self-hatred tied to the world around us, but that\u2019s not Siobhan Roy. She\u2019d have no patience for a young woman lacking the drive to stake out her place in the world.\n\nThen there\u2019s the marriage itself. Frances and Nick\u2019s affair is shrouded in secrecy, a far cry from the open arrangement Shiv craves. When Melissa, Nick\u2019s wife, finds out about their affair she\u2019s possessive over Nick, agreeing to allow their arrangement to continue in an email that makes it clear he\u2019ll always belong to her. On the flip side, Melissa\u2019s previous affairs are presented not as part of a healthy arrangement, but as indiscretions that contributed to Nick\u2019s declining mental health. Shiv is the one pushing Tom into an open marriage, in stark contrast to Frances, who let\u2019s Nick decide when they\u2019re sleeping together, and Melissa, who stays with her adulterous husband because he\u2019s less depressed when in the midst of an affair.\n\nConversations With Friends certainly makes sense for the moment, but Shiv would have quit 50 pages in. I can just picture her rolling her eyes as Frances types passive-aggressive emails to Nick late into the night, refusing to take a stand and say what she really wants. I\u2019m guessing that Shiv would be drawn to narratives of strong-willed women defining relationships on their own terms \u2014 women like Madeline in Laura Lippman\u2019s Lady in the Lake, Edna in The Awakening, Amy in Gone Girl, Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice, and the women in Naomi Alderman\u2019s The Power. Just a few suggestions once she puts down Conversations With Friends.\n\nSuccession gets brownie points for featuring such a delicious literary Easter egg in Sunday\u2019s finale, but let\u2019s be real: Shiv stopped reading it ages ago.", "description": "A few thoughts about Shiv Roy\u2019s surprising book choice in Succession\u2019s second season finale.
