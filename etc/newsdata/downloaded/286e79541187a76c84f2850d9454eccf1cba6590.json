Quantitative easing, or QE, is a way for central banks to inject more money into the overall supply.\n\nGundlach, who oversees $140 billion, reiterated this point again Wednesday.\n\n\"The Fed might have to start 'QE lite' as I call it, meaning they go back to expanding their balance sheet in line with the increase in currency to get the free reserves in the system higher,\" he said on CNBC's Halftime Report.\n\nQE is usually used when interest rates are already low, as a way to jump start the economy. After the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed under then-chairman Ben Bernanke conducted unprecedented QE to boost economic recovery.\n\nRead more: MORGAN STANLEY: The stock market just shifted by a magnitude that usually precedes recessions. Here's why it's an ominous sign once again.\n\nAt the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee Wednesday, the central bank cut its benchmark rate by 25 basis points, a move largely in line with expectations. It marked the second cut of 2019 \u2014 the only two since the financial crisis more than a decade ago. Previously, in July, the Fed cut by the same amount.\n\nGundlach, who's been referred to over time as the \"Bond King,\" has predicted a 75% chance of a US recession before the presidential election in November 2020. He's reiterated this forecast recently, saying that the likelihood of a recession is now higher because of changes in the Treasury yield curve.\n\nThe yield-curve inversion \u2014 a long-watched indicator that has preceded every US recession since 1950 \u2014 is not the most important signal, he said. He thinks it's instead an inversion occurring and going away that's a true red flag. In August, the yield curve between 2- and 10-year Treasuries inverted and then righted itself later.\n\nWhen recession does hit, Gundlach has said that he's worried about debt in the US, from government debt to student loans to the $8 trillion corporate-debt market.\n\nRead more: 'The early stages of a collapse': The stock market is undergoing a ruthless shift that reminds JPMorgan of a seemingly invincible trade that blew up in 2018", "description": "Jeffrey Gundlach said that the Federal Reserve may look to expand its balance sheet after a spike in overnight purchase agreements that prompted the Fed t...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d827b9f2e22af79f0228a68-2000/rtr2mwet.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
