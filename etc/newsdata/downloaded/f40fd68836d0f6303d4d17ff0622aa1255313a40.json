REUTERS/Mohamed Azakir\n\nThe decision by the Sunni leader shocked Hussein al-Khalil, political advisor to Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who advised him against giving in to protesters who wanted to see his coalition government toppled.\n\nThe meeting described to Reuters by four senior sources from outside Hariri\u2019s Future Party captures a critical moment in the crisis that has swept Lebanon for the last two weeks as Hariri yielded to the massive street protests against the ruling elite.\n\nThe resignation has left a political vacuum and paralysed a state in need of urgent action to steer Lebanon out of an economic crisis that is hitting all Lebanese hard, including Hezbollah\u2019s Shi\u2019ite constituency.\n\nOfficials at Hariri\u2019s office and Hezbollah could not immediately reached for comment.\n\nThe meeting which began at 8 p.m. at Hariri\u2019s Beit al-Wasat residence in central Beirut did not last long.\n\n\u201cI have made my decision I want to resign to make a positive shock and give the protests some of what they want,\u201d Hariri told Khalil, according to one of the sources.\n\nKhalil sought to change his mind. \u201cThese protests are nearly over, breathing their last breaths, we are next to you, steel yourself,\u201d Khalil told Hariri.\n\nBut Hariri stuck by his decision.\n\nHe complained he was not getting the support he needed to carry out a major cabinet reshuffle that might have defused the street and allow the quick implementation of reforms. \u201cI can no longer bear it and I am not getting any help,\u201d Hariri said.\n\nThe main sticking point, Hariri said, was Hezbollah\u2019s Christian ally Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, a son-in-law of President Michel Aoun with whom the prime minister had clashed repeatedly since his cabinet was formed in January.\n\nWhile Hariri sought a major reshuffle that would remove Bassil - a target of protester ridicule - and others, Bassil and Aoun had resisted any reshuffle on the basis that demonstrators might not leave the street and demand even more concessions.\n\n\u201cYou, Hezbollah, are standing behind Gebran and supporting him,\u201d Hariri told Khalil, according to the source.\n\nBassil could not be reached for comment.\n\nAfter announcing his resignation, Hariri expressed relief.\n\nA senior official familiar with his thinking told Reuters he could form a new government if his conditions are met.\n\nA BLOW TO HEZBOLLAH\n\nThe resignation is a major blow for Hezbollah, which is more deeply involved than ever in the affairs of Lebanese government and as keen as anyone to stave off deeper financial problems that could lead to a destabilising currency crisis.\n\nAhead of the resignation, Nasrallah had twice said he was against the resignation of the Hariri government, suggesting that some of the protesters were financed by the group\u2019s foreign adversaries and implementing their agendas.\n\nThe post of prime minister must be filled by a Sunni Muslim in Lebanon\u2019s sectarian system, and while Hezbollah has Sunni allies, Hariri is seen as critical to navigating a way out of this crisis because of his international backing.\n\n\u201cThis is a strong blow to Hezbollah. Its hands have now been tied,\u201d said a source familiar with Hezbollah\u2019s thinking. \u201cThe biggest winner is Hariri.\u201d\n\nHariri entered this cabinet, his third, with the balance of power tilted against him and in favour of the heavily armed Hezbollah, which together with its allies won more than 70 of parliament\u2019s 128 seats in a 2018 election.\n\nHariri had lost more than one third of his lawmakers in that election, including some to Sunnis aligned with Hezbollah.\n\nHezbollah allies, including the FPM of Bassil and Aoun, secured the lion\u2019s share of cabinet seats in Hariri\u2019s cabinet. Hariri clashed with Bassil, particularly over long-elusive reforms needed to plug gaping holes in the state finances.\n\nHezbollah forged its alliance with the FPM in 2006, winning an influential Christian friend as Lebanese politics was recast by the withdrawal of the Syrian government forces that had dominated the country since the end of the 1975-90 civil war.\n\nAs foreign minister, Bassil has consistently spoken in international forums such as the Arab league to defend Hezbollah and its possession of weapons. He is seen as a presidential hopeful.\n\nIn line with Hezbollah\u2019s view, Bassil called for Syria to be allowed back into the Arab League at a meeting earlier this month, generating more friction with Hariri because it was at odds with Lebanese government policy.\n\nThe source familiar with Hezbollah\u2019s thinking said the group had refrained from attacking Hariri over his decision to quit, to leave open the possibility of him becoming prime minister of a new coalition cabinet. Hezbollah \u201cmust preserve a way back\u201d from the crisis, the source said.", "description": "After hitting a dead end in efforts to defuse the crisis sweeping Lebanon, Saad al-Hariri informed a top Hezbollah official on Monday he had no choice but to quit as prime minister in defiance of the powerful Shi'ite group.", "authors": ["Laila Bassam", "Tom Perry", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446647676&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T1T3", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
