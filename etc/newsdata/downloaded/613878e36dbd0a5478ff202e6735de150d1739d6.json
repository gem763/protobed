Sheets should be enjoyable, not just a necessity. You should be putting thought into what you\u2019ll be sleeping under each night. Whether that\u2019s percale or sateen, your sheets decision could affect how you sleep, which will affect the rest of the day. We\u2019ve rounded up some of the highest-rated sheets that will keep you waking up on the right side of the bed each morning (or at least give you a head start).\n\nLuxe Core Sheet Set, $149 from Brooklinen: These are the first sheets I\u2019ve ever truly cared about, and that\u2019s coming from someone that requests a specific pillowcase when visiting her parents\u2019 house. The Luxe Core Set is all you could need (a flat sheet, a fitted sheet, and two pillowcases) and it comes in a multitude of colors. These sheets have a hotel-like softness that I only thought existed in, well, hotels.\n\nPercale Sheet Set, $149-$229 from Riley: If you\u2019re looking for durable sheets that will wear into the perfect vintage T-shirt-like softness, look no further than these. I love Riley\u2019s towels and the sheets are pretty fantastic, too. They\u2019re crisp, cool, and comfortable and will get even softer as you wash them.\n\nSolid Hemmed Sheet Set, $200-295 from Boll & Branch: The Signature Soft sheets from Boll & Branch are made from organic cotton and are soft to the touch, without even having to wash them. The hemmed edge gives it an upscale feel without feeling too finicky. These are simple, organic sheets that will make your sleep more comfortable every time you get in.\n\nCasper Sleep Soft and Durable Supima Cotton Sheet Set, $70-$170 on Amazon: Obviously, Casper knows its way around a bed. These Supima cotton sheets are strong, meaning they won\u2019t pill or thin even after you wash them a million-and-one times. They\u2019re breathable and soft without feeling like you\u2019ll tear them in the middle of the night if you tend to toss and turn in your sleep. They also come in pretty snazzy two-tone options.\n\nThread Spread True Luxury 1000-Thread-Count 100% Egyptian Cotton Bed Sheets, $90-$100 on Amazon: A 4-star rating on over 4,000 reviews is nothing to scoff at. The sateen weave of these 100% Long Staple Pure Egyptian Cotton sheets from Thread Spread (what a name!) are some of Amazon\u2019s highest-rated and best-selling sheets.\n\nNEWSLETTERS The Scouted Newsletter Product recommendations that'll make your life better and tips to help you shop smarter.
