Sixty years ago, black and white families came together to create and maintain integrated neighborhoods. The school district began voluntary busing in 1970, and boundary lines were drawn to make schools more integrated. Student groups dedicated themselves to black achievement, race relations and cross-racial friendship.\n\nSo why, last November, was 16-year-old Olivia McDowell on the stage of Shaker Heights High School, begging the packed auditorium to understand how hard it is to be one of the few black kids in Advanced Placement English?\n\n\u201cI need answers,\u201d Olivia said after escaping her seat, jumping onstage and taking the microphone out of the principal\u2019s hand. She had ignored her mom\u2019s admonition to keep quiet and, unable to suppress her rising anger, outed herself as the student at the center of a swirling controversy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my education,\u201d she said. \u201cMy education.\u201d\n\nSixty-five years after the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision declared segregated schools inherently unequal and ordered desegregation plans, many school districts remain deeply segregated. Racial issues are raw in many systems.\n\nYet in Shaker Heights, healthy race relations are a cornerstone of the community\u2019s identity, the reason many choose to live here, a central organizing principle for the schools.\n\n\n\nHomes in Shaker Heights. (Maddie McGarvey for The Washington Post)\n\nIn the 1950s, the first black families arrived, an event that triggered white flight in so many other communities. In Shaker, white families knocked on doors and got to know their new neighbors. Founded as a wealthy and white enclave of privilege, Shaker reinvented itself.\n\nThrough it all, the schools built and maintained a reputation of excellence, sending large numbers of students to elite colleges and developing robust Advanced Placement and, later, International Baccalaureate programs. Theater and arts programs are top-notch. Students can take classes in French, Spanish, German, Latin or Greek, plus Mandarin, which is taught to all elementary school students. Last year, the high school sponsored seven international trips for students.\n\nTaxpayers, including some of the wealthiest people in the Cleveland area, approved one tax levy after the next, driven by the slogan \u201ca community is known by the schools it keeps.\u201d\n\nWhile some inner-ring suburbs flipped from virtually all white to almost entirely black over time, Shaker schools remain nearly half white and just over half black decades after the first black families moved to the city.\n\nBut the story of Shaker Heights shows how moving kids of different races into the same building isn\u2019t the same as producing equal outcomes. A persistent and yawning achievement gap has led the district to grapple with hard questions of implicit bias, family responsibility and the wisdom of tracking students by ability level. Last school year, 68 percent of white 11th-graders were enrolled in at least one AP or IB course, but just 12 percent of black students were.\n\nRacial achievement gaps in Shaker Heights schools Share of black and white public school students, 2018-2019 Kindergartners identified as on track 30% 84% 4th-graders scoring average or higher in English 80 99 8th-graders enrolled in high school math or physical science 30 85 9th-graders scoring proficient or higher in English 50 95 11th-graders enrolled in at least one AP or IB course 12 68 High school students graduating within four years 93 98 Source: Shaker Heights City Schools KATE RABINOWITZ/THE WASHINGTON POST Racial achievement gaps in Shaker Heights Share of black and white public school students, 2018-2019 Kindergartners identified as on track 30% 84% Fourth-graders scoring average or higher in English 80 99 Eighth-graders enrolled in algebra I, geometry or high school physical science 30 85 Ninth-graders scoring proficient or higher in English 50 95 11th-graders enrolled in at least one AP or IB course 12 68 High school students graduating within four years 93 98 Source: Shaker Heights City Schools KATE RABINOWITZ/THE WASHINGTON POST Racial achievement gaps in Shaker Heights schools Share of black and white public school students, 2018-2019 30% 84% Kindergartners identified as on track 80 99 Fourth-graders scoring average or higher in English/language arts 30 85 Eighth-graders enrolled in algebra I, geometry or high school physical science 50 95 Ninth-graders scoring proficient or higher on English end-of-course assesments 12 68 11th-graders enrolled in at least one AP or IB course 93 98 High school students graduating within four years Source: Shaker Heights City Schools KATE RABINOWITZ/THE WASHINGTON POST\n\n\u201cAny time you break our data out by race, we look like two different schools,\u201d said Chris Rateno, director of student data systems for the district, which is home to about 31,000 people and eight schools.\n\nThe racial tension coursing through the packed auditorium last November traced back to a tense exchange between Olivia and a veteran AP English teacher, Jody Podl, six weeks earlier. Olivia had been dozing in class, playing with her phone. Now, her first big assignment of the year was late. The teacher had admonished and embarrassed Olivia. Olivia\u2019s mom fired off a three-page complaint, suggesting racism and charging bullying. The district put the teacher on leave to investigate.\n\nThe racism allegation was quickly dismissed, but on Nov. 8, the date of the community meeting, the district was still investigating Podl, who is white, for bullying. Her fellow teachers were furious. Would they be accused of racism or bullying every time they told a student to do better in class? They arrived to the community meeting in force, wearing red union T-shirts.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to Jody (and is still happening to Jody) could happen to any one of you,\u201d the union president said in an email encouraging teachers to attend the meeting.\n\nAnd yet this is a district trying to raise the achievement levels of black students. Shouldn\u2019t teachers do everything they can to encourage promising African American kids?\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post's Laura Meckler in the driveway of her childhood home in Shaker Heights. (Family photo)\n\nIt\u2019s a struggle close to my heart. I grew up in Shaker Heights and went to Shaker schools from kindergarten through 12th grade. I received an excellent education with many courses more challenging than what I would find in college. I took AP English and history, subjects that came naturally to me, but also AP math, struggling my way through calculus.\n\nAs a white kid in an integrated school, I thought Shaker was a special place that had gone a long way toward figuring out race. But how true was that? Over the course of more than two years, I talked with nearly 100 people \u2014 parents, students, teachers, administrators and community leaders, both black and white, and with my own high school teachers and classmates. Returning as a reporter, and walking the hallways of my old schools, I set out to understand with fresh eyes a place I\u2019ve known my entire life.\n\n\n\nEarline Hooper, 90, at home in Shaker Heights in June. Hooper was among the early black residents, and one of her daughters was in the first class of students to be bused. (Maddie McGarvey for The Washington Post)\n\n\u2018An American dream town\u2019\n\nEarline Hooper\u2019s youngest daughter graduated from Shaker Heights High in 1984, but she heard there was trouble at the school, found out about that Nov. 8 meeting and decided to attend.\n\nHooper, now 90, still lives in the house she and her husband bought in 1965. They were part of the early wave of African American families, and one of their daughters was in the first class of students bused to a mostly white elementary school across town. At the November meeting, she heard heartbreak, and her heart broke a little, too.\n\n\u201cThere were some people that sat near me \u2014 did what I felt like doing \u2014 crying,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was just that depressing. And my feeling was, has it come to this?\u201d\n\nEstablished in 1911, Shaker Heights was developed as a bedroom community for Cleveland, with rigid architectural guidelines and deed restrictions meant to keep black, Catholic and Jewish families out. It featured a rapid transit line to ferry workers downtown and manicured man-made lakes. In 1960, it was reportedly the wealthiest community in America, with Tudor mansions and expansive colonials lining certain streets.\n\n\n\nThe March 1963 issue of Cosmopolitan magazine. (Reprinted with permission of Hearst Magazine Media Inc. Cover photo \u00a9 Bob Willoughby / mptvimages.com/Cosmopolitan)\n\n\u201cHere is the inside story of an American dream town come true,\u201d boasted Cosmopolitan magazine in 1963. The magazine noted a range of housing, including some rentals, but reported a near absence of poverty or unemployment.\n\nCosmo hardly mentioned it, but in the early 1950s, black families began moving into Shaker, many to a middle-class neighborhood called Ludlow, bordering Cleveland. The first reaction was hardly welcoming. In 1956, a bomb exploded at the site of a home being built for John Pegg, a prominent black attorney, and his wife, Dorothy.\n\nNo one was hurt, but the incident jolted white neighbors and set off a drive for integration. White and black neighbors vowed to get to know one another and formed the Ludlow Community Association for socializing and strategizing. The group encouraged and helped finance white families to buy in the neighborhood, and fought off predatory real estate agents seeking to scare them away.\n\nThe association\u2019s work morphed into the Shaker Housing Office, which would show homes for sale, but only to families who would improve the racial balance in a neighborhood. As a practical matter, this meant encouraging white buyers and discouraging blacks. To try to stave off white flight, the city banned \u201cfor sale\u201d signs on lawns.\n\nJohn and Dorothy Pegg, in a photo from about 1956.

(Bill Nehez/Michael Schwartz Library, Cleveland State University)\n\nLudlow remained integrated for years, but by the late 1960s, Shaker realized that Moreland Elementary School, the school attended by the Hooper children, had become almost entirely African American.\n\nJohn H. Lawson, then superintendent of Shaker schools, made the case that integration was needed to ensure all children received a great education. He began touting a busing program that became known as the Shaker Plan.\n\nMy mother didn\u2019t have any school-age children yet, but she recalls being at a community meeting and speaking in favor of the plan, which drew national attention as a rare case of voluntary integration. Some feared that property values would fall, or that transportation would be too expensive, but the program began in 1970 with widespread support.\n\nBlack students from Moreland were bused to mostly white elementary schools, and vice versa. In the 1980s, Shaker closed several elementary schools and redrew the boundaries to racially balance the remaining buildings.\n\nHooper says she and her husband did not hesitate to bus their daughters to Malvern, a mostly white school on the wealthy side of town. But she had been a Girl Scout leader at Moreland and wondered if the white parents would let their daughters join an integrated troop. They did.\n\n\n\nReuben Harris, a longtime champion of equity and former school board member and father, in Beachwood, Ohio, in May. (Maddie McGarvey for The Washington Post)\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, those statistics are valid\u2019\n\nReuben Harris was not in the high school auditorium the evening of Nov. 8, although he watched the spectacle online later. It felt familiar.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, integration was well established in Shaker Heights, but so was an unsettling racial achievement gap the district wasn\u2019t talking about. Then came Project Achieve, a committee of parents, teachers and community members formed to dissect the district.\n\nHarris, who is black and whose daughter was then in the Shaker schools, served on a subcommittee on achievement that broke down data by race. He assumed there would be disparities. He was right.\n\nThe report, finalized in March 1997, found that whites made up about half of all students but 93 percent of those in the top 20 percent. Black students made up 82 percent of those who failed at least one portion of a state proficiency exam. Of all grades earned in core high school classes by black students, about 40 percent were a D or an F.\n\nShaker was portraying itself as high-achieving \u2014 and that was true, for some. No one wanted to talk about the lower achievement levels of black students, fearing the community reaction. \u201cThere was this hush-hush about it,\u201d said Scott Stephens, the district\u2019s spokesman.\n\nOnce the data was public, black students and parents became furious. Some felt they were being painted as academic losers. At a community meeting, the crowd was in something of a frenzy when Harris took the microphone.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, those statistics are valid and are accurate,\u201d he said. He tried to turn the question around: \u201cWhat are you going to do to change those?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me, it was painful \u2014 to see the reaction of students and parents,\u201d Harris said in a recent interview. \u201cNot unexpected, but painful.\u201d\n\nThe reasons for low achievement are complex. Some black parents detect teacher bias. Almost every black parent seems to have a personal story.\n\nMark Joseph, an African American professor at Case Western Reserve University, recalled a parent-teacher conference for his son, then in middle school, where a teacher was puzzled when Joseph asked how they were going to get his son to the next level. \u201cMalik\u2019s above average. What are you asking?\u201d she said, according to Joseph.\n\n\u201cI wondered, is she saying this to white parents also?\u201d he said.\n\nAyesha Bell Hardaway, an African American member of the school board and a 1993 graduate of Shaker Heights High, remembered being told by her ninth-grade honors English teacher that she should drop down a level \u201cbecause African American students don\u2019t do well in honors and AP.\u201d\n\nThen, she told me who that teacher was. I was stunned to learn it was the same teacher I had, and loved, for AP English. Sheepishly, I called my former teacher, who had left the district years ago, to ask about that conversation with Hardaway nearly 30 years earlier. She said she didn\u2019t remember it.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s time to take action\u2019\n\nFor 24 years, the district was led by Mark Freeman. Freeman, who is white, speaks with pride about his work to integrate school buildings. Over that span, Shaker tried to tackle the racial gaps.\n\nThe Student Group on Race Relations formed in the 1980s to foster black-white relationships. The Minority Achievement Committee crowned MAC scholars, high-achieving black boys to serve as role models. Black students were encouraged to join study circles. Outside experts were imported to study Shaker schools.\n\nBut in interviews, Freeman seemed somewhat resigned to segregation within buildings. Asked if there was a solution to the achievement gap, he set a high bar: \u201cEradicate racism and eliminate poverty.\u201d\n\nHe was well aware that advanced classes were dominated by white students, while regular college prep, or CP, courses were dominated by black students. The disparity was so obvious that some African Americans joked that CP stood for \u201ccolored people.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights investigated a complaint about racial disparities in AP enrollment. Freeman said his response was: \u201cOkay, what do you want us to do? What do you suggest?\u201d The district entered into an agreement vowing to fix the problem.\n\nBy the time Freeman retired in 2013, a growing contingent of parents was ready to see him go. Freeman describes himself as having \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about his departure.\n\nThe community signaled a desire for the next superintendent to focus on equity. They got it with Greg Hutchings, a black educator with a shaved head and a taste for bow ties. Hutchings spoke in a clip and didn\u2019t mince words.\n\n\u201cIn Shaker, we\u2019ve been talking about diversity, we\u2019ve been talking about equity for a very long time,\u201d he said in his 2017 State of the Schools speech, announcing the start of an Equity Task Force. \u201cIt\u2019s time to take action.\u201d\n\nThe new superintendent found problems all over the place. Parent-teacher organizations were run \u201clike sororities,\u201d catering to white stay-at-home moms, with meetings in the middle of the afternoon. Parent-teacher conferences were scheduled during work hours, impossible for some parents to attend. Some of the best teachers taught only AP classes.\n\nHis Equity Task Force would ultimately recommend a policy called \u201ctargeted universalism.\u201d It is meant to convey that Shaker will set high standards for all but resources will be targeted to make sure everyone can meet those standards. The board adopted the policy this spring, and the district followed up with small-group explorations of race and equity.\n\nShaker also began looking at informal systems that landed white children in advanced courses more often than black students. Placement was determined by test scores and teacher recommendations, but parents who knew to ask could get their kids into those classes. So Shaker made an open enrollment policy explicit.\n\nTo mitigate classroom segregation, Shaker sometimes combined kids of different abilities in the same classes. The district stopped letting parents request teachers and guidance counselors for their kids. And it encouraged teachers to consider whether their own biases were affecting how they worked with students.\n\nEducators supported the goal, but some were put off by Hutchings.\n\n\u201cIt was clear to the staff that he was blaming us for the gaps,\u201d said Sarah Davis, a white social studies teacher at the high school who started a summer program called Bridges to help black kids prepare to take AP classes. She said what Hutchings billed as a listening tour with staff felt more like a \u201clecture tour.\u201d\n\n\n\nJody Podl at home in Shaker Heights in June. Podl is an AP English teacher who was placed on leave over an issue with a student. (Maddie McGarvey for The Washington Post)\n\nOne teacher who complained about Hutchings\u2019s leadership was Podl, the AP English teacher. They clashed over his decision to push out the high school principal, and she says he once called her into his office because her \u201cbody language\u201d at a community meeting was \u201cinappropriate.\u201d\n\nAfter Hutchings chose a new principal over the candidate Podl and many faculty members preferred, she was at a tense meeting between Hutchings and teachers. Podl said she must have reacted to something someone said because Hutchings \u201cscreamed, \u2018Don\u2019t you roll your eyes at me! That\u2019s disrespectful.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI was a little bit of a marked person\u201d after that, she said. \u201cFor Greg, he just wanted people to agree with him, and if you didn\u2019t agree with him, you weren\u2019t on his side.\u201d\n\nHutchings declined to discuss Podl but said he had tried to get teachers to understand their role in perpetuating the achievement gap. \u201cWe were at times blaming children. And that was my concern,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t blame achievement gap issues on children we are hired to educate.\u201d\n\nEquity and excellence\n\nLara Mullen, a white mother of two sons in Shaker schools, sat in the auditorium at that November meeting and was disgusted, mostly with administrators.\n\nShe\u2019d been annoyed from the start with Hutchings, and now the people he hired appeared to be botching things again.\n\nThe meeting had been called, supposedly, to introduce David Glasner as the interim principal of the high school. But the people in the room all wanted to talk about why the previous principal had been ousted, and about Podl.\n\nMullen supported programs to help boost kids who have untapped potential, but she had concerns with the equity push Hutchings had championed, as well as his personal style. Once, she said, he had berated her by phone for asking to see the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of a finalist for a top district job.\n\nShe was irritated at his move to bar parents from requesting certain teachers. She said each year she would talk with the teachers for the next grade up and consider who was the best fit for her boys. She rejects any suggestion that this system allowed certain parents to get the best teachers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get all the best teachers. I get the teachers who are right for my kids,\u201d she said.\n\nAn ad hoc group of affluent parents had a growing list of concerns. Among them: Higher-achieving students would lose out if resources were shifted to lower-achieving kids. Honors and AP classes wouldn\u2019t be as challenging if the district pushed in students who weren\u2019t prepared. The schools might not be orderly if the district eased up on discipline.\n\nParental nervousness got the attention of Earl Leiken, who then was mayor of Shaker Heights. Leiken worried that if there was too much emphasis on children who needed the most help, wealthy families would leave for other suburbs.\n\nHe walked around with a pie chart showing that in 2015, 28 percent of the income tax dollars collected in Shaker were produced by families earning more than $500,000 per year and nearly half came from those earning more than $300,000. The suggestion was obvious: If those families leave the district, the economics of the place collapse.\n\nIn interviews, every one of these parents said they value diversity and wouldn\u2019t live in Shaker if they didn\u2019t. Some feared their views would sound racist in print and wanted people to know they weren\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI love the fact that this is an integrated community,\u201d said Kevin White, an investment banker and father of three, who is white. \u201cMy children all have friends of different races and backgrounds. That\u2019s not possible when you live somewhere without diversity.\u201d\n\nBut White said it\u2019s critical that Shaker keep wealthy people satisfied or they might move away, taking their tax dollars with them. He said keeping them in Shaker benefits everyone, including people who need the most help.\n\n\u201c \u2018Equity\u2019 may win votes, but if you really want to protect the tax base, your motto would be \u2018excellence, excellence, excellence,\u2019 \u201d White said.\n\n\u201cEquity means you\u2019re picking and choosing who the heck you are focusing on,\u201d said Jim Sammon, a white father of two. \u201cIf you\u2019re paying a lot of money [in taxes] and you think your kid\u2019s not getting the benefit of it, why are you staying?\u201d\n\nSome feared the changes at the school were lowering property values. Adam Kaufman, a real estate agent who sells many expensive Shaker homes, said that\u2019s not true. But he said Hutchings made his job harder.\n\n\u201cShaker has always had the reputation as an affluent suburb. If you\u2019re affluent, you live in Shaker Heights. The superintendent didn\u2019t like that connotation. His motto was that we need to be known as being equal instead of affluent.\u201d\n\nA small group of fathers arranged a meeting with Hutchings to express their concerns that wealthy families would leave Shaker, and asking him to promote statistics showcasing high achievers. They came away frustrated that he didn\u2019t seem to care.\n\nThey decided that the better course was to try to elect like-minded people to the school board, and in 2017 they successfully backed two white women.\n\nIn December 2017, Hutchings announced that he was leaving at the end of the school year. He had been offered what he said was his dream job \u2014 superintendent of the public schools in Alexandria, Va., his hometown.\n\nSome were devastated, fearful that the equity work he had turbocharged would fall away. Some had long thought he was using Shaker as a steppingstone and said the announcement confirmed it. Others were relieved.\n\nAt his final school board meeting last year, Hutchings took a swipe at his critics, urging the board and others to ignore parents who complain.\n\n\u201cMost of my time is spent dealing with the ignorance that comes from adults,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nOlivia McDowell, left, attends her AP English class at Shaker Heights High in May. (Maddie McGarvey for The Washington Post)\n\n\u2018What about the student?\u2019\n\nHerlinda Bradley did not want her daughter to speak at the Nov. 8 community meeting. \u201cYou will sit there,\u201d she instructed Olivia.\n\nOn the way in, they overheard two white girls talking about how Podl, the English teacher, had been treated so badly. Inside the auditorium, they saw a huge show of support for Podl. Signs read, \u201cJustice for Jody.\u201d\n\nAdministrators were pelted with questions about Podl: Will the district investigate how she was treated? Why wasn\u2019t she given the chance to defend herself?\n\n\u201cWhat about the emotional damage that\u2019s already been done to Ms. Podl?\u201d an elementary school teacher asked.\n\nOlivia\u2019s legs were shaking and she felt adrenaline coursing. Finally, she took the stage and said she was the girl Podl had admonished, the black girl in AP English who had fallen behind.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get emotional, but I care about my education,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy is it about the teacher\u2019s feelings? What about the student? \u2026 What about the damage to a student when they\u2019re, what, one of three, one of five black kids in their class because of the whole education gap that y\u2019all have?\u201d\n\nThe incident dated to the start of the school year. Most of the facts are not in dispute. Olivia admits she had been falling asleep in class and was playing with her phone. The first big assignment, an outline for a paper about \u201cA Tale of Two Cities,\u201d was due. She didn\u2019t have it.\n\nStanding at Olivia\u2019s desk, Podl began asking questions. What English class had she taken last year? What other courses were on her schedule now? The teacher was trying to determine whether Olivia was overloaded. She warned that if Olivia didn\u2019t improve her work, she might get a D. Podl says she was talking about a D on that assignment; Olivia recalls Podl threatening a D for the class.\n\nOlivia was mortified that other students might have overheard the conversation. She kept her composure in the classroom but feel apart after excusing herself to go to the restroom.\n\nAfter class, Podl called Olivia\u2019s mom and learned how upset Olivia was. She went to find Olivia in her next class and apologized for upsetting her.\n\nTeacher and student thought the incident ended there. But Olivia\u2019s mother was furious and, 10 days later, dashed off a three-page letter of complaint to the district.\n\n\u201cTo the class, Olivia is a poor performing African American student who may not be capable of achieving. How is this situation truly repaired?\u201d she wrote. \u201cShaker constantly questions, why there are not more students of color in advanced classes? Mrs. Podl\u2019s behavior is one example that helps to answer that question.\u201d\n\nWithout first talking to Podl, the high school principal (soon to be removed from his post) put her on paid leave.\n\nMother and teacher agree that the district mishandled the allegation. Bradley says she didn\u2019t want Podl removed from the classroom but figured the district must have had other allegations she didn\u2019t know about. At no point did the school system bring the parties together to try to talk it out.\n\nPodl says she can\u2019t understand why she wouldn\u2019t have been given a chance to defend herself before being put on leave. The allegations wounded her to the core. She\u2019s known as a tough teacher \u2014 withering for some, beloved to others, but the kind who replies at midnight when a student emails. And Podl, a 1983 Shaker graduate, thought of herself as an ally to black students. She helped bring Facing History and Ourselves, a professional development program about racism and prejudice, to Shaker High. She added Bryan Stevenson\u2019s book \u201cJust Mercy\u201d to her curriculum.\n\nIn fact, she and Olivia\u2019s mother had participated together in a handful of racial equity events.\n\nThe district swiftly dismissed the allegation of racism. But it found other students who complained of bullying, and administrators declared Podl guilty and put a disciplinary letter in her file. The union took the matter to arbitration, complaining the district had denied Podl the right to defend herself. The district backed down and rescinded the letter, but it would not declare definitively that Podl was innocent.\n\nIn April, the arbitrator ruled in Podl\u2019s favor. The district issued a statement saying it was \u201caware of the decision\u201d and looked forward to \u201cmoving forward.\u201d But Podl wasn\u2019t ready to go back to the classroom.\n\n\u201cThis has been kind of a gut punch to me,\u201d she said. \u201cMy dominant emotion is sad. I just feel really sad.\u201d\n\nBridging the gap\n\nIn 2016, the high school began a program called Bridges, which enrolled promising black students in a summer program to prepare them to take AP American history that fall. The program teaches study skills and creates a cohort of students to support one another.\n\nOn a Monday morning in June, just days after the school year ended, history teacher Brian Berger looked out at dozens of black faces and told them this program was an opportunity, not a penalty.\n\n\u201cYou guys have been selected because you\u2019re smart,\u201d he told them. \u201cSuccessful people work all year.\u201d\n\nOver time, Shaker\u2019s challenge has grown tougher. That\u2019s because economic gaps widened.\n\nThirty years ago, the median income for white families was almost double that of black families. By 2017, the typical white family earned nearly three times as much \u2014 more than $118,000 per year vs. about $43,000 for the typical black family, according to Census Bureau data.\n\nOver the same span, the portion of black families living in poverty in Shaker Heights more than doubled, from about 6 percent in 1989 to about nearly 16 percent in 2017, according to census figures. The portion of whites in poverty inched up from 2 percent to 4 percent.\n\nNationally, researchers say lower achievement levels by black students can be traced to economics. Black students are more likely to live in lower-income families, with parents having less money for educational extras, more life stress and fewer hours to help with homework. Parents may have had negative experiences with school, and feel less comfortable talking with teachers.\n\nThe gaps are also social. Parent-teacher associations can serve as informal networks where parents learn what\u2019s going on and who the most popular teachers are. They tried to diversify their leadership, but one afternoon this March, four white moms met in the middle of the afternoon to plan next year\u2019s roster for the PTO at Onaway Elementary School.\n\nThe next evening, the PTO hosted a program with the head of the high school\u2019s elite IB diploma program, and four students \u2014 two black, two white \u2014 explained the program. Parents were invited to consider questions such as, \u201cTo what extent does perspective shape truth?\u201d\n\nIt was a cool presentation, one that would excite parents for the opportunities ahead, but out of more than two dozen Onaway parents in attendance, not one was African American.\n\n\n\nDavid Glasner, photographed in May, became superintendent of the Shaker Heights City School District this summer. (Maddie McGarvey for The Washington Post)\n\nA time for incremental change\n\nSitting on the stage Nov. 8 with a deer-in-the-headlights expression was David Glasner, who would soon be chosen as superintendent. He had just been named interim high school principal, and the meeting was called to introduce him in his new role.\n\nNo one there had the slightest interest in talking about that.\n\n\u201cI relive that moment frequently,\u201d Glasner said months later. The event was not set up for success, he said, and never should have been scheduled.\n\nSchool board member Lisa Cremer, who clashed with Hutchings as a parent, said Glasner represents a \u201cday and night\u201d personality contrast and hopes he can work more constructively with teachers. She\u2019s concerned that, in the aftermath of the Podl controversy, many on the faculty fear for their jobs if there\u2019s a misstep.\n\n\u201cWhatever equity work we want to do, it\u2019s not going to happen until we repair the relationships with the teachers,\u201d she said. She also thinks Glasner may have more success because \u201cto be purely blunt, he\u2019s a white guy.\u201d\n\nOn equity, Glasner is hoping to win buy-in by moving more slowly than Hutchings did.\n\n\u201cThere are times for drastic change and there are times for incremental change. And I think I\u2019m going to focus a little more on the latter,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nOne of the toughest issues he\u2019ll face is the tracking system \u2014 what one administrator called the \u201cgiant sorting machine\u201d \u2014 that begins separating students by ability as young as second grade, with clear racial patterns from the start. Glasner said last spring he was looking to overhaul the approach for the youngest children, though in September he said it was a subject that needs additional community discussion.\n\nIn September, Glasner named \u201cblack student excellence\u201d as one of two priority areas for this school year, aiming to increase test scores and AP course participation.\n\nHe also had a more immediate challenge \u2014 to bring the conflict with Podl to a close. In July, he and the new high school principal met with her. Within five minutes, she told them she was not emotionally ready to return to the classroom. She suggested that one precondition for her return would be the district grappling with what happened in the case of Olivia. She also wants better policies in place for any future accusations.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t addressed any of this, and you can\u2019t just go on and think that\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d she said. She said she didn\u2019t expect a response on the spot, and Glasner did not offer one.\n\nIn an interview, Glasner noted that new administrative personnel were in place and offered an admission of culpability, of sorts. In the Podl case, he said, \u201cthere was a failure of leadership.\u201d He said he is reviewing the district\u2019s procedures around staff discipline.\n\nPodl still craves closure. She wants an exoneration, something that would help her when she runs into people she knows at the grocery store. In August, she went to the school board meeting and pleaded for the district to grapple more fully with her case.\n\n\u201cWe teach our children and our students that when you make a mistake, you need to own up to it. What if the district had the wherewithal to do the same thing?\u201d she asked.\n\nFor her part, Olivia began her senior year in August. Her schedule includes AP Literature.\n\n\n\nThe Post's Meckler, right, with three of the Lardie kids, who lived next door. In the pool are Meckler's childhood best friend, Betsy, who now goes by Mary Allen, left, and Betsy\u2019s sisters Missy (Lardie) Maroun and Maria (Lardie) Hewitt, who are twins. Jim and Diane Lardie adopted five children, including the three girls. (Family photo)\n\n\u2018The faith was real clear\u2019\n\nHearing Olivia\u2019s story got me thinking about my own. I was in AP classes, and sometimes I struggled, too. Kids in my class were crazy smart, and it seemed to come so easy for them. But I never considered that my classmates might think I didn\u2019t belong there. It never crossed my mind that I didn\u2019t belong. Of course I was in AP English. Where else would I be? I realize now that was a form of white privilege in action \u2014 being in AP and knowing that no one questioned it.\n\nYet Olivia, who is now 17, is not that different from me. She wasn\u2019t pushed into AP courses as part of an affirmative action effort to diversify. She has been taking advanced courses since middle school. In class, she raises her hand and has lots to say, just like I usually did. She thinks she might want to be a writer. She lives with her mom, just two blocks from where I grew up with my mom, on a middle-class street, across town from the mansions and lakes that give Shaker Heights its charm.\n\nWhen I visited her at home, I was gobsmacked to see that the layout of their house was virtually identical to my childhood home.\n\nAfter talking with Olivia and her mom, I stopped by the home of my next-door neighbors growing up, Jim and Diane Lardie. More than anyone, they had shaped my views on race. They are white, with six children \u2014 five adopted, four of them biracial or black. Their daughter Betsy was my first best friend, and I remember as a very young girl asking my father why Betsy was half black and half white. \u201cBecause one of her biological parents was black and one was white,\u201d he told me matter-of-factly. I grew up thinking there was nothing odd about it.\n\n\n\nDiane and Jim Lardie at home in Shaker Heights in June. (Maddie McGarvey for The Washington Post)\n\nAs I made the short drive from Olivia\u2019s home to theirs, I realized that I never knew how the Lardies landed on Scottsdale Boulevard.\n\nThey told me their story. Jim and Diane met in fourth grade, growing up on the east side of Cleveland, in a white neighborhood home to many Irish Catholics. One by one, black families arrived. Jim recalled, as a child, his grandmother taking him by the hand to greet one of the first, who moved in across the street. She told him they were going to do what they did for every new neighbor \u2014 bring Irish soda bread.\n\n\u201cI never read in the good book where you love your neighbor unless they\u2019re colored,\u201d his grandmother told him.\n\n\u201cThe faith was real clear and it was pounded into us,\u201d Diane said.\n\nThey saw their neighborhood flip from white to black before their eyes, spurred by real estate agents who scared white homeowners into selling. Diane said her parents were the second-to-last white family on the block.\n\nThey married and had a daughter, but Diane was unable to get pregnant again, so they decided to adopt, which is how a white infant named Jimmy arrived. Soon after, the Lardies told the adoption counselor they would like to adopt again and asked if she knew any children who needed homes. \u201cI have some but they are unadoptable,\u201d she told them.\n\n\n\nDiane Lardie displays a family photo at her home in Shaker Heights. (Maddie McGarvey for The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cThat changed our lives,\u201d Jim told me. The idea that any child was unadoptable was unacceptable to them. Jim ultimately quit his job and became a full-time advocate for children in need. The Lardies adopted four more children \u2014 hard-to-place kids. They went looking for a community where they thought their family would be welcomed.\n\nFor me, that\u2019s what Shaker always was about. A place that would welcome the Lardies.\n\nTalking in their living room, filled with photos of grandchildren and great-grandchildren, with Easter jelly beans in a dish on the coffee table, I had one more question. Betsy had been pulled out of Shaker schools after elementary school and sent to Catholic school. Why?\n\n\u201cAt the end of sixth grade, I had three daughters who could not write a simple sentence,\u201d she told me. \u201cThe Shaker schools were wonderful for a motivated kid like you. They were not wonderful for kids who had to be sat on and prodded.\u201d\n\n[What is your experience with school integration?]\n\nAfter leaving the Lardies, I knocked at my childhood home next door, and a biracial teenager, Jacob Tinnon, answered. He and his parents graciously let me look around. They showed me his room, which long ago was my room. We saw the basement with the same wood paneling and the same secret compartment in the back, behind the laundry. They told me the rosebush my mother planted was still pricking people with its thorns.\n\nJacob and his brother are thriving in Shaker schools. But he said it\u2019s not always easy.\n\n\u201cIf I say something that\u2019s dumb in class, sometimes I\u2019ll be judged differently \u2014 \u2018Ooh, of course he\u2019d say something like that,\u2019 \u201d Jacob said. \u201cIf I get a good grade on a test, it\u2019s, \u2018Oh, you did so good!\u2019 Like surprised. Well, I studied.\u201d\n\n\u201cI kind of like that,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause I like to prove people wrong.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeckler at her childhood home in Shaker Heights in June.
