He also reminded viewers that he was a professional lawyer as he pushed unfounded conspiracy theories targeting a spate of his boss\u2019s political rivals.\n\n\u201cThese people are such intellectual heavyweights, I don\u2019t know if I could handle Schiff,\u201d Giuliani said Monday, appearing to joke about Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the chair of the House Intelligence Committee who recently sent him a subpoena.\n\nGiuliani went on to push unfounded claims about the Biden family, Trump\u2019s 2016 political rival Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cWake up, Democrats. You are covering up corruption, and by the time this is over, you\u2019re going to be the party of corruption,\u201d Giuliani said. Earlier in the show, he noted that lawmakers \u201cseem to forget that I\u2019m a lawyer. If I were defending a terrorist, they\u2019d be going crazy that I was called before a committee.\u201d\n\nGiuliani begins his Hannity interview by pushing a conspiracy theory about Obama and Hillary Clinton colluding with Ukraine to dig up dirt on Trump in January 2017 -- which doesn't make much sense since the presidential election had come and gone by then pic.twitter.com/08yHvUYcgJ \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 1, 2019\n\nThe chairs of multiple House committees subpoenaed Giuliani and three of his associates Monday as part of the inquiry, demanding he produce communications and other documents related to his work for the president. The subpoena pertains to material from Jan. 20, 2017, the day before Trump\u2019s inauguration, to the present.\n\n\u201cOur inquiry includes an investigation of credible allegations that you acted as an agent of the president in a scheme to advance his personal political interests by abusing the power of the office of the president,\u201d said the letter, signed by Schiff and two other Democratic congressmen: Eliot Engel (N.Y.), chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Elijah Cummings (Md.), chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee.\n\nGiuliani must comply with the subpoena by Oct. 15, although the former New York City mayor has already pushed back on its merits, claiming on Twitter that it raised \u201csignificant issues concerning legitimacy.\u201d\n\nI have received a subpoena signed only by Democrat Chairs who have prejudged this case. It raises significant issues concerning legitimacy and constitutional and legal issues including,inter alia, attorney client and other privileges. It will be given appropriate consideration. \u2014 Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) September 30, 2019\n\nHouse Democrats are investigating Giuliani\u2019s role in the unfolding scandal over Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as part of their impeachment inquiry.\n\nDuring the July conversation, Trump repeatedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company for five years. A reconstruction of the call released last week showed Trump asking Zelensky for a \u201cfavor\u201d shorty after Zelensky brought up millions in military aid the U.S. had appropriated for Ukraine.\n\nNeither Biden has been accused of any wrongdoing, despite Giuliani\u2019s claims.\n\nGiuliani appears to be one of the central figures related to that favor, which Democrats have called an unprecedented quid pro quo for political dirt. The attorney is mentioned multiple times in a formal whistleblower complaint about the call, and he has admitted in television interviews that he met with Ukrainian operatives. But Giuliani has recently said he did so at the behest of the State Department. Trump has also denied any impropriety and moved to discredit the unnamed whistleblower.", "description": "\u201cThese people are such intellectual heavyweights,\" Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, told Fox's Sean Hannity.", "authors": ["Nick Visser"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/P_sPf3AdjfJnWV90pYoV6g--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9Mjg4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d92ae762200005100db9a81.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
