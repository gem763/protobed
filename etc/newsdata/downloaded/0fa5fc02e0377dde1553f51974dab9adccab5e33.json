The network offered the candidates 15 more seconds for answers and rebuttals than were allotted on NBC and CNN and the moderators tended to avoid cutting off the candidates in mid-sentence, which was the case during the 2nd debate in July.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe result was a contest heavier on policy differences and lighter on the kinds of finger-pointing and quips that marked the two previous rounds of Democratic debates.\n\nIn the midst of it all, longtime Hillary Clinton aide Philippe Reines praised ABC for having \u201clearned from the best & worst of the previous two.\u201d\n\nSome of this was due to the gravitas of George Stephanopoulos and David Muir, the ABC stalwarts whose deft handling of the exchanges between candidates gave the debate a smoothness lacking in earlier rounds. The two veterans were joined by ABC correspondent Linsey Davis and Univision anchor Jorge Ramos, whose pointed questions drew more attention.\n\nAt one point, the audience at Texas Southern University cheered when Davis grilled Sen. Kamala Harris on her shifting positions on criminal justice issues and asked, \u201cWhen you had the power, why didn't you try to affect change then?\u201d\n\nDavis, who is black, began a segment focused on racism by acknowledging the debate was being held at a historically black college and that young black voters were especially concerned with the issue. Ramos, an anchor at Spanish-language Univision, which partnered with ABC on the debate, kicked off questions on immigration by grilling former Vice President Joe Biden the three million deportations during the Obama years.", "description": "By giving candidates more time for give and take, the network minimized interruptions and cut-off answers.", "authors": ["Michael Calderone"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a7/18/5c8d852943ec9c2231cad87802cc/19913-dem-debates-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
