Interfaith Couple Denied Room In OYO Hotel", "language": "en", "text": "In another case of policing people\u2019s choices, a Jaipur OYO hotel denied a room to a couple because they belonged to different religions. This incident happened on Saturday, 5th October, when the man arrived at one of OYO\u2019s SilverKey Hotels at about 8-9 am. All was going well until he mentioned the name of the woman who would be checking in with him.\n\nThe man is a 31-year-old Assistant Professor from Udaipur while his companion is a woman from Delhi. Since the Professor had arrived before her on Saturday, he tried to check into their room. When he informed the receptionist the woman\u2019s name, he was told that they couldn\u2019t be checked in because she was Hindu and he was Muslim.\n\nSpeaking to a leading publication, the man said, \u201cI had booked a room for two in the hotel through a travel app. I reached the hotel somewhere around 8-9 am. The receptionist then asked me about the other person who was to check in with me and I gave them my friend\u2019s name, but to my shock I was told that \u2018this is a problem. Both of you are from different religions, we can\u2019t check you in.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen asked why this was so, the hotel manager said that this was an order given by the police \u201cboth in writing and orally\u201d. Of course, the hotel refused to produce the written order by the police.\n\nJaipur Police Commissioner Anand Shrivastava denied that the police issued any such instructions. \u201cNo such instructions, either written or verbal, have been issued. They are merely misusing the name of police,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Assistant Professor stood his ground and told the hotel that it was against our basic right to equality, as granted in the Constitution, to discriminate on the basis of religion. He told the staff, \u201cThere is no such rule, and it didn\u2019t say so anywhere--either on the app or on the hotel website--and that it goes against the Constitution which guarantees equality.\u201d\n\nOYO refunded the amount to the Assistant Professor and booked him another room free of cost, albeit it was of \u201cinferior quality\u201d. OYO has issued a statement that it is against discrimination of all kinds and is looking into the matter internally. But, is that enough?\n\nMoral policing is rampant in India\n\nJust last week, a video of a Bengaluru man who was wearing a \u201cpant-suit\u201d shaming a woman from not wearing Indian clothes went viral on the internet. He felt that shorts were not part of \u201cIndian rules\u201d. Of course, nobody says anything to the men roaming around in shorts and a baniyan all day.\n\nCouples are routinely harassed by cops while harmlessly strolling through parks or for holding hands. Women are shamed for wearing dresses and shorts. It\u2019s not like interfaith couples are anything new, they have been around for a long time but people still think it is okay to shame those who date those from other religions.\n\nWhen will people stop thinking that it is their job to tell people what to eat, what to wear, and whom to date? Freedom of choice is enshrined in the Constitution. We should respect it.\n\n\n\n", "description": "In yet another incident of moral policing, a 31-year-old Muslim assistant professor from Udaipur was denied a room at an OYO hotel because his companion was a Hindu woman.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://im.idiva.com/content/2019/Oct/iDiva_Interfaith-couple-denied-room-in-OYO-hotel_Social_5d9d8f3eaad97.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
