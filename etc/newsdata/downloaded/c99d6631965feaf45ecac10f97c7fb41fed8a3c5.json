In fact, I\u2019m friends with a lot of people who don\u2019t share the same beliefs that I have. Just because I don\u2019t agree with someone on everything doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not going to be friends with them. When I say be kind to one another, I don\u2019t mean only the people that think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone.\u201d\n\nEllen DeGeneres, a self-proclaimed \u201cgay Hollywood liberal,\u201d was responding to the firestorm that erupted across social media when she was spotted sitting next to former president George W.

Bush over the weekend.
