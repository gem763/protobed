The price remained in a bearish zone and broke many supports near $9,800 and $9,500. Moreover, there was a break below the $9,000 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Finally, the price traded close to the $8,000 level and registered a nasty decline. A low was formed near $8,055 and the price is currently correcting higher.\n\nThere was a break above the $8,250 and $8,400 levels. Moreover, the price traded above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $9,779 high to $8,055 low. However, the $8,750 level is acting as a strong resistance. The next resistance is near the $8,920 level. It coincides with the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $9,779 high to $8,055 low.\n\nIf there is an upside break above $9,000, the price could recover towards the $9,400 and $9,500 resistance levels. Additionally, there is a crucial bearish trend line forming with resistance near $9,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. An intermediate resistance is near $9,120 and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $9,779 high to $8,055 low.\n\nOn the other hand, if the price continues to struggle near $8,750 and $9,000, it could resume its decline. An immediate support is near the $8,400 level, below which it could test $8,250. If the bears remain in action, there is a chances of a break below $8,000. The next major support is near the $7,500 level.\n\nLooking at the chart, bitcoin price is clearly bleeding below $9,000 and it might continue to decline. It seems like there are high chances of a break below $8,000 in the near term.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD is showing a few positive signs in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for BTC/USD is currently struggling to recover above the 30 level.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $8,250 followed by $8,000.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $8,750, $8,800 and $9,120.", "description": "Bitcoin price nosedived below $9,000 and tested $8,050 against the US Dollar.
