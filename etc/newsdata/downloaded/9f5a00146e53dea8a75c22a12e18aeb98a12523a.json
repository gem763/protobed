He also complained about \u201chearing an Asian trying to learn English.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d representative said the show hired Gillis \u201con the strength of his talent as a comedian and his impressive audition for SNL.\u201d\n\nThe clip of Gillis re-emerged last week just hours after NBC, a unit of Comcast Corp. CMCSA, -1.30% , said that he and two others, including the show\u2019s only Asian American performer, were joining the cast as featured players.\n\n\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d has taken heat over the years for an overall lack of ethnic diversity, with scant Asian representation among its cast members or hosts.\n\nFormer players Fred Armisen and Rob Schneider are each one-quarter Asian, but neither has been widely recognized for Asian ancestry. Among hosts, the long history of \u201cSNL\u201d includes only a short list of Asians or Asian Americans, with Awkwafina, Aziz Ansari and Jackie Chan among them.", "description": "\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d has rescinded its invitation to a cast member who posted a video last year in which he used a racial slur for Chinese people and...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR403_gillis_ZG_20190916163942.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
