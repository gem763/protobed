Police were initially not certain about its authenticity\n\n'Police from the Harbourside LAC responded and located the victim in her bedroom with what she described as a bomb locked around her neck.'\n\nThe Harbourside Local Area Command officers described the teen as 'distraught' at the time. She was convinced she was going to die.\n\nMaddie was able to tell officers that a man wearing a balaclava and carrying a baseball bat entered her home and told her she wouldn't be hurt as long as her parents followed instructions.\n\n'He then locked a device around her neck so it could not be removed. He also put a USB thumb drive attached to a lanyard around her neck. A plastic sleeve was attached to the lanyard which held a two page document outlining extortion demands and instructions,' police documents read.\n\n'Act now, think later or you will inadvertently trigger a tragically avoidable explosion known in the American armed forces as a Brian Douglas Wells event,' Peters wrote.\n\nThe 'Brian Douglas Wells' event he referenced occurred in the US in 2003, when a man was killed after he detonated a collar bomb.\n\nNSW Police released a photo of the touch pad device (pictured) which was strapped to Maddie\n\nThe hoax bomb (pictured) was attached to the teen's neck for more than 10 hours as police worked to determine whether it was fake\n\nA never before seen X-Ray image taken while the bomb was still attached to Maddie's neck displays the complex situation officers were faced with.\n\nThe device featured a coded touch pad and sophisticated technology which initially baffled the team, who were working in a high pressure situation, fearing the intruder was watching from afar.\n\nPeters was eventually arrested two weeks later in his ex-wife\u2019s home in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nHe told a psychiatrist during court proceedings that he had no memory of the crime but suggested he had taken on the persona of a character in a book he was writing.\n\nThe court heard Peters started to morph himself into his protagonist John Chan, and he was looking for \u2018dual revenge for Chan and for me,\u2019 but a defence the judge said he was \u2018not prepared to accept\u2019.\n\nMaddie was able to tell officers that a man wearing a balaclava and carrying a baseball bat entered her home and told her she wouldn't be hurt as long as her parents followed instructions\n\nPeters was sentenced to 13 years and six months in jail \u2013 with a minimum of 10 years to be served.\n\nDuring sentencing, Judge Peter Zahra said: 'The offender placed the victim in fear that she was going to die in order to extort money from her family.\n\n\u2018The victim was vulnerable, being entitled to the sanctuary of her own home\u2026 the terror she experienced can only be described as unimaginable.\u2019\n\nSpeaking outside the court after sentencing, Madeleine said she was pleased with the result and hoped that she and her family could now look to a future \u2018where Paul Peters\u2019 name is not linked with mine.\u2019\n\nHer father said: \u2018She\u2019s a very, very special young lady who has handled herself with incredible poise and dignity throughout this trial.'", "description": "Madeleine Pulver was studying for the HSC in the bedroom of her $AU15million Mosman home in August 2011 when a balaclava-clad intruder broke in.", "authors": ["Brittany Chain For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/10/20369134-0-image-a-8_1572431550849.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
