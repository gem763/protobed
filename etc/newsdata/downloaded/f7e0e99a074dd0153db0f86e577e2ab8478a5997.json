In his three-minute rant, Durant said that Strauss did not talk to him or anyone in the organization for the story, which Strauss denied.\n\n\"I definitely reached out,\" Strauss said. \"And he didn't want to talk and that was more or less what had happened before when he took exception where I said, 'Hey, if you have an issue or if I'm coming with something, I can talk to you about it.' And he wasn't in that kind of mood.\"\n\nOver his career, Durant has frequently stated his opinions on social media and responded to both stories and fans on various platforms. In the podcast, Strauss said that while the trait may be admirable, it could be harmful long term.\n\n[RELATED: Nash on why he believes KD left]\n\nStory continues\n\n\"There are writers that I believe Kevin thinks about more than they think about him,\" Strauss said. \"He's the only guy I could put in that category that are at the level that he's at. It's kind of unbelievable and maybe it's just really honest but I also don't think it's the most emotionally healthy level to be.\"\n\nIn addition to dishing on his spat with Durant, Strauss also spoke on his cooking exploits, the relationship between media and players, and the upcoming Warriors season.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarriors reporter targeted in Kevin Durant media tirade shares his side originally appeared on NBC Sports Bay Area", "description": "Nearly seven months after Kevin Durant scolded the media, the reporter at the center of the attack addressed the incident.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FrQeDc4DglKY8VXQyImz5g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6795UjxcwZpev4aexAadkA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnbayarea.com/d630efc55cd7f1737c4a7bddc47654eb", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
