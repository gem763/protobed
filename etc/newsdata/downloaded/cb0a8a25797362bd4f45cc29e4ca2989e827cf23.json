News.\n\nLuke - real name Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald - is accusing Kesha of spreading false allegations about him in order to get released from her recording contract with him.\n\nIn 2014 Kesha sued the producer claiming that she was drugged and raped by Dr Luke in 2005 after the two attended a birthday party for Nicky Hilton - claim Lukasz has adamantly denied.\n\n'Kesha and her representatives repeated her false accusation that Gottwald had purportedly drugged and raped her in countless public forums,' states Dr Luke's complaint.\n\nIt also states that Kesha 'spread a knowingly false and wholly defamatory accusation that Gottwald had purportedly raped another female recording artist.'\n\nTik tok: Kesha had her bid to appeal the defamation lawsuit filed against her by Dr Luke denied (pair above in 2011)\n\nIn addition to the 2005 attack, Kesha claims was psychological abuse and fat-shaming, left the singer with 'severe depression, post-traumatic stress, social isolation, and panic attacks.'\n\nKesha and her lawyers argued this behavior was a breach of contract and demanded the singer be allowed to abandon her record deal with Dr Luke.\n\nThen court ultimately ruled in Dr Luke's favor, forcing Kesha to record three more albums with the producer.\n\nKesha has unsuccessfully appealed that decision three times.\n\nAppeal: Kesha had previously lost an appeal last year, but the court granted her reconsideration to preview her arguments and evidence supporting her appeal. The star is seen in 2016 above\n\nDr Luke filed his suit the same day as Kesha's original suit, back in October 2014, during which time he also named her mother and manager for defamation.\n\nKesha's mom and manager were later dropped from the complaint due to jurisdiction issues in the case, though the two are still accused of aiding Kesha in the complaint.\n\n'Kesha and her team also promoted boycotts and social media harassment of third parties who continued to work with Gottwald in order to pressure them to stop doing so,' states the complaint.\n\n'Kesha's management even went so far as to develop a plan for \"leaking\" to the public the cell phone numbers and email addresses of top-level executives from SonyMusic Entertainment and its related entities.'", "description": "The Believer singer tweeted a pledge to never work with the veteran producer unless he drops his lawsuit against Kesha\u00a0and releases her of any contracts she has with him (publishing etc).'", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/17/19598156-0-image-a-14_1570810942931.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
