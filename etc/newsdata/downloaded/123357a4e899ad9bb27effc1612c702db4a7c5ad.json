In contrast, \"general advice\" is not tailored to any of the consumer\u2019s personal circumstances. The classification is important because personal advice creates a legal obligation for the adviser to act in the customer's best interest and issue a statement of advice; if the advice is \u201cgeneral\u201d, there is no such duty.\n\nASIC deputy chair Karen Chester at The Australian Financial Review Banking & Wealth Summit this week. She said on Thursday that \"consumer confusion about what is personal and general advice needs to be addressed\u201d. AFR\n\nA new Australian Securities and Investments Commission report, titled \u201cFinancial advice: mind the gap\u201d and released on Thursday, finds only 53 per cent of those surveyed could correctly identify a piece of \"general\" advice. Furthermore, nearly 40 per cent were unaware that advisers providing general advice are not required by law to act in their best interests.\n\nEven though the major banks are getting out of personal advice, they may still seek to offer \"general advice\" in their branches, but ASIC is concerned that could confuse customers given such \"advice\" is often no more than a recommendation to buy a particular bank's products.\n\n\u201cThis disturbing gap in understanding whether the advice they are getting is personal or not means many consumers are under the false premise their interests are being prioritised, when no such protection exists,\u201d said ASIC deputy chair Karen Chester.", "description": "Major banks exiting personal advice have been put on notice the \"general advice\" label could be misleading to customers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2853%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_401/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6c5caa7cf3d525793eccdcaf283b069e0a43239d", "published_at": "2019-03-28"}
