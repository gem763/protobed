It's part of a plan to reduce fatalities by 30 per cent in two years and its trial has already been pretty effective. Here's what drivers in NSW - and other states - need to know.\n\nYour Digital Driver Licence: What Aussies Need To Know After successful trials in selected suburbs, New South Wales is looking to launch the digital driver licence statewide by the end of this year, which means you won't need to carry around a physical licence any longer. The option is already available in South Australia and other states and territories are set to follow. Here's how it all works. Read more\n\nWhat's happening again?\n\nThe NSW Government announced on 22 September its mobile phone detection trial had been successful and it was looking to implement it state-wide by late 2019.\n\nThe trial came into effect in early 2019 after the relevant legislation was passed approving authorities to photograph drivers using their mobile phones while in moving vehicles. The trial ran between January and June 2019 and, according to Transport for NSW, checked 8.5 million vehicles during its time and detected more than 100,000 drivers illegally using their mobile phones.\n\nThose caught were found to be browsing Facebook, text messaging and one driver was even caught allowing his passenger to steer the wheel. Wow.\n\nGiven the trial's success, fixed and portable phone detection cameras will now be positioned in 45 spots across the state and there won't be any warning signs like we're used to with existing speed cameras.\n\n\"We have to unfortunately use the element of surprise to get people to think 'well, I could get caught at any time',\" Andrew Constance, NSW Minister for Transport and Roads, said.\n\n\"I want behaviour to change and I want it changed immediately.\n\n\"It's not about revenue \u2014 it's about saving lives.\"\n\nYou can watch the eerily silent announcement video from NSW for Transport below for a glimpse of what the technology will look like.\n\nSo, how does mobile phone detection work?\n\nUsing artificial intelligence, the cameras can detect mobile phone use in even the worst of conditions. Whether it's raining or cloudy, night or day, the camera will be able automatically review images of the front-seats of a vehicle. If the camera detects an offending driver, it will supposedly exclude the passenger from the image if they're not doing anything wrong. Images are then reviewed by an authorised human worker to verify an offence was made.\n\nImage: YouTube/Transport For NSW\n\nIf you get nabbed by the camera within the first three months of its rollout, you'll get sent a warning letter, but once that's up all bets are on. An offence captured by the phone detection camera will cost you five demerit points and a $344 fine ($457 if it's in a school zone) for a first-time incident. During double demerit point periods, it will go up to 10 demerits.\n\nIf the rules of mobile phone use while driving still confuse you a bit, check out Transport for NSW's website. Below are the dos and donts for fully-licensed drivers.\n\nImage: Transport for NSW\n\nJust a friendly PSA there's a zero tolerance approach for learners and P-platers in NSW using phones while driving. A big old N-O.\n\nNSW Texting And Driving Laws Are About To Get Much Tougher From September 2018, just touching your phone while you're driving could be enough for NSW drivers to lose their license. The number of demerit points for using a phone while driving is set to increase from four to five this year, so drivers should probably brush up on the rules around phone use while driving now. Read more\n\nWill other states get it?\n\nYou really shouldn't be using your phone while driving ever unless it's for hands-free navigation, or anything else in the 'legal basket', but still, the lack of signs or warning does feel unfair. While drivers living outside of NSW might feel a sense of relief for now, you shouldn't just yet. Visiting the state means you'll also be affected by the laws once the technology is rolled out and if it's successful, other states will likely look to introduce it as well.\n\nLifehacker Australia has reached out to the relevant road authorities in Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australian and Tasmania to confirm whether they have similar plans on the way and will update when they respond.", "description": "The NSW Government recently announced it was introducing mobile phone detection cameras, which would be rolled out from late 2019 across the state.
