(the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cPacific Rim Cobalt\u201d) (CSE: BOLT) (OTCQB: PCRCF) (FRANKFURT: NXFE) is pleased to announce final results from the recently completed detailed recovery process bench scale test program. The test program is being conducted by a extractive technology and mineral process development partner (\u201cProcess Research ORTECH Inc.\u201d - PRO) for the selection of a suitable process for recovery of nickel and cobalt from laterite material.\n\nCritical Results:\n\nThe solution quality of the nickel bearing pregnant strip solution indicates an estimate of the NiCO 3 product quality of >99.9% NiCO 3 requiring only a single stage purification process.\n\nproduct quality of >99.9% NiCO requiring only a single stage purification process. The solution quality of the cobalt pregnant strip solution indicates that an estimate of the CoCO 3 product quality is 98.2% CoCO 3 .\n\nproduct quality is 98.2% CoCO . In the next stage of development, our partner Process Research ORTECH Inc. is confident of improving CoCO 3 purity to greater than 99.9% .\n\nThe aim of the program is to assess the amenability of the Partner\u2019s proprietary mixed chloride leach and solvent extraction separation technology on laterite samples from the Company\u2019s Cyclops project in Indonesia for the production of high purity nickel and cobalt products and obtain design and operating data for the pilot plant testing phase.\n\n\"The Company is very pleased with this latest round of results and look forward to continued progress. We are optimistic about the unique possibility of developing this project into an asset that will add shareholder value,\" remarked Ranjeet Sundher, President and Chief Executive Officer of Pacific Rim Cobalt.\n\nSamples were leached using the Partner\u2019s proprietary mixed chloride technology, i.e., the mixture of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and magnesium chloride (MgCl 2 ). Results of the leach tests showed that the mixed chloride leach technology was effective in the recovery of value elements, namely nickel, and cobalt from the three laterite samples tested.\n\nDetailed leach testing was performed to optimize the recovery of nickel, cobalt and iron from representative samples of 3 laterite types:\n\nlimonite\n\nlow iron transition\n\nsaprolite\n\nThe leach conditions were established for the three samples and the results indicate the following recoveries:\n\nSample Recovery Ni (%) Co (%) Fe (%) Limonite 99.26 98.82 97.77 Low Iron Transition 99.75 97.03 99.22 Saprolite 99.77 >99.9 99.74\n\nFollow up detailed solvent extraction (SX) testing was performed to examine the separation of nickel, cobalt, and iron from the leach solution produced from each sample. Pregnant strip solutions for nickel and cobalt were produced from the SX samples.\n\nThe preliminary design criteria for the leaching and solvent extraction process has now been established and this combined with other data obtained from the study will be used for subsequent pilot plant testing to be conducted in the next phase.\n\nThis phase of the program will involve the commissioning and operation of a pilot plant incorporating an integrated circuit to produce high purity nickel and cobalt strip solutions in order to develop battery grade Nickel and Cobalt products that meet market specifications.\n\nThis plant will also provide operational data for development of CAPEX and OPEX estimations for a demonstration plant and a produce enough nickel and cobalt-bearing product for independent evaluation by prospective battery industry purchasers.\n\nThe latest results are part of an integrated program being implemented by the Company to develop a critical path for processing nickel and cobalt laterites. The Development Program consists of the following components:\n\nEvaluation of process technology\n\nProcess feasibility studies\n\nDesign, construction and operation of pilot plant\n\nDesign, construction and operation of demonstration scale plant\n\nUpcoming development includes the following:\n\nPilot Plant\n\nLocation Canada\n\nProduce high purity strip solutions suitable for production of nickel and cobalt MHP and nickel and cobalt sulphates\n\nEstablish design criteria for a demonstration plant\n\nProduce nickel and cobalt products meeting market specifications\n\nEnsure tailings and effluents meet environmental guidelines\n\nDemonstration plant\n\n\n\nLocation Indonesia\n\nEvaluation of technical and economic aspects of a commercial scale plant\n\nDemonstrate ability to produce a product within market specifications\n\nProvide product for market evaluation\n\nEstablish security of long-term product supply through optimum plant availability\n\nEstablish design criteria for a commercial scale plant\n\nNational Instrument 43-101 Disclosure\n\nThe technical content of this news release has been reviewed and approved by Mr. Garry Clark, PGeo, independent director of Pacific Rim Cobalt and a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101.\n\nAbout Pacific Rim Cobalt\n\nPacific Rim Cobalt is a Canadian\u2010based exploration company focused on the acquisition and development of production grade nickel and cobalt deposits, key raw material inputs for the growing lithium\u2010ion battery industry.
