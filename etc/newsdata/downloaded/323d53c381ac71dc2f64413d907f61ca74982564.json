It Could Wipe Out Iran's Swarm Boats in a War", "language": "en", "text": "Key Point: Defeating swarms with A-10 Warthogs isn\u2019t exactly revolutionary but that isn\u2019t so much a problem. The plane isn\u2019t a high-tech laser, but it doesn\u2019t need to be.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t necessarily take the resources of a major nation-state to challenge U.S. Navy warships. China for instance is building up a large navy and invests in long-range, ship-killing missiles. Iran can\u2019t build a large navy but it does invest in swarms of small missile boats.\n\nLike a swarm of insects, a swarm of boats can pose a threat as a larger, far more expensive warship might not be able to swat them all \u2014 and a single missile with enough punch can be devastating.\n\nSo the U.S. military is practicing with ways to defeat such a potential threat with tank-killing A-10 Warthogs.\n\nOn Feb. 6, 2017, the low- and slow-flying Warthogs together with Canadian CF-18 Hornets carried out simulated attacks on dozens of boats in Florida\u2019s Choctawatchee Bay. The planes didn\u2019t drop any ordnance, however, as the boats were being piloted by local captains hired by the Air Force.\n\nThese were simply mock attack runs. An Air Force news release also noted that the civilian sailors practiced \u201crealistic swarm attack formation maneuvers\u201d with mocked-up machine guns fitted to their boats.\n\nThe 1980s-vintage Warthogs \u2014 built around a 30-millimeter rotary cannon and capable of carrying a variety of bombs and missiles \u2014 did fire inert rounds on unmanned boats at a different time during the exercise. The munitions expended during that other phase of the exercise also included delta-wing AGM-65 Maverick missiles and 500-pound laser-guided bombs.\n\n\u201cWe evaluate precision guided munitions against realistic targets with realistic enemy defenses,\u201d Lt. Col. Sean Neitzke of the 86th Fighter Weapons Squadron said.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "At least that is the plan.", "authors": ["Robert Beckhusen"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mYvU19OWmrFL54wWaeNCGA--~B/aD05MDc7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/d248d76f593d928bafbd9858a21d5e0d", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
