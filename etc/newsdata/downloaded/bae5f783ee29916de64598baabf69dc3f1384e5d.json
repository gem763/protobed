Don't ever in your life talk to me like that, I asked you politely. It's too early in the morning for you! You're lucky I don't smack you in your face.\"\n\nA spokesman for Southern Railway said: \"There is no place for abusive or threatening behaviour on our services. We urge anyone who witnesses something like this to text the British Transport Police on 61016.\"\n\nThe Met Police have been approached for comment.", "description": "It is believed the vicious row erupted on the Southern Railway train to London Bridge when the woman asked the pregnant passenger seated next to her to move over and was told to 'lose some weight'", "authors": ["Brendan Mcfadden", "Image", "News Dog Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20563151.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-SHOCKING-MOMENT-WOMAN-RIPS-A-PEARL-NECKLACE-OFF-A-PREGNANT-PASSENGERS-NECK-ON-PACKED-TRAIN-AFTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
