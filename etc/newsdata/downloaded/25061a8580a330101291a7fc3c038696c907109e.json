First, like various other men who share the \u201cgenius\u201d epithet\u2014see: Einstein, Picasso, Jobs\u2014Edison is sometimes portrayed as a beautiful mind that emerged from the chrysalis of childhood awkwardness. He did bounce in and out of various schools in Ohio and Michigan, frustrating teachers in his early years. But under his mother\u2019s tutelage, he read steadily and voraciously. By the age of 13, Edison had built a one-boy business selling fruits, groceries, and newspapers that netted $50 a week\u2014the equivalent of an $80,000 annual salary today. Nearly all of this haul went to buying equipment for electric and chemical experiments. Barely pubescent, Edison was already combining the twin skills that would make him world-famous: a natural talent for earning money and an innate compulsion to invent.\n\nA second myth that Morris swats away is the notion that Edison was a mere popularizer of other people\u2019s work\u2014a businessman who didn\u2019t really invent anything. Most inventions adapt previous breakthroughs: From the steam engine to the iPhone, crucial advances have resulted from a tweak of a tweak of a tweak. To create something entirely new is practically impossible. And yet Edison seems to have done just that.\n\nEarly one morning in 1877, in his newly established lab in Menlo Park, New Jersey, he was playing with a diaphragm\u2014a cup-shaped device with a thin metal bottom, which vibrated as Edison shouted into it. Edison thought if he attached a needle to that metal bottom, he could record his words\u2019 vibrations on a soft surface. An assistant built a small cylindrical device to spin a scroll of wax paper beneath the tip of the needle. Edison bellowed \u201cMary Had a Little Lamb\u201d into the mouthpiece, and the needle etched his utterances into the wax paper, creating a retraceable record of the poem. \u201cOn pulling the paper through the second time,\u201d his assistant Charles Batchelor wrote, the vibrations passed back through the needle and out through the mouthpiece, and \u201cwe both of us recognized we had recorded the speech.\u201d\n\nAs far as we know, this was the first time in history that a human being listened to a recorded sound. Morris describes the moment in Homeric tones:\n\nSince the dawn of humanity, religions had asserted without proof that the human soul would live on after the body rotted away. The human voice was a thing almost as insubstantial as the soul, but it was a product of the body and therefore must die too\u2014in fact, did die, evaporating like breath the moment each word, each phoneme was sounded. For that matter, even the notes of inanimate things\u2014the tree falling in the wood, thunder rumbling, ice cracking\u2014sounded once only, except if they were duplicated in echoes that themselves rapidly faded. But here now were echoes made hard.\n\nThe year after inventing the phonograph, Edison built a telephone that surpassed the devices made by its inventors, Alexander Graham Bell and Elisha Gray, in an official contest of call clarity. The year after that, he achieved semidivine status with his incandescent light bulb. He did all this by the time he was 33, despite almost no prior experience in acoustics, telephony, or illumination technology. Such a feat is all but imponderable, like an athlete winning MVP awards in basketball, football, and baseball in consecutive years, having received barely any formal training in ball sports.", "description": "It wasn\u2019t the light bulb or the phonograph or the moving picture\u2014or anything tangible. It was a way of thinking about technology.", "authors": ["Derek Thompson", "Edmund Morris"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2019/10/CULT_Thompson_Edison_Lead_small/facebook.jpg?1570793822", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
