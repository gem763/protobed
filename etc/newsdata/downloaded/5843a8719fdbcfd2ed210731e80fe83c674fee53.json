Petrol car sales were up 2.6 per cent.\n\nSales of plug-in hybrid cars are down by 29.2 per cent after Government grants for new low-emission cars were slashed in October last year - meaning hybrid models are no longer eligible for the scheme.\n\nMotoring groups have warned that the decision will leave the UK struggling to meet targets to reduce vehicle emissions.\n\nAlex Buttle, director of car selling comparison website Motorway.co.uk, said the new reg plate last month didn't give new car sales the significant boost the industry needed.\n\n'Diesel sales fell for the 30th consecutive month, petrol sales were only up marginally and plug-in hybrids continue to suffer from the Government cutting grants at the end of last year,' he said.\n\n'The one green shoot amongst all this negative noise is the strength of electric car sales, with numbers feeling healthy and promising in September. But electric and hybrid sales alone can't yet prop up a car industry that is struggling daily.'\n\nSome 343,255 new cars rolled out of factories in September, up 1.3% on last year\n\nHoward Archer, chief economist at EY Items Club, pointed to a number of 'roadblocks' hitting demand for new cars: ' [...] business and consumer caution over making major purchases, sharply reduced demand for diesel cars amid environmental concerns and stricter emission regulations affecting supply (another round of emissions testing legislation coming into effect on 1 September).\n\n'A further hit to the sector has come from the removal of incentives to buy plug-in hybrid vehicles.'\n\nThe SMMT has called on the Government to avoid a no-deal Brexit and agreeing a future with the EU that avoids tariffs and barriers 'that could increase prices and reduce buyer choice.'", "description": "New car sales edged up in September, but despite new registration plates which typically prompt high demand, the rise was below expectations.", "authors": ["Camilla Canocchi For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
