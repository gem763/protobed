It is one of our most important markets. This year alone we announced that we are investing millions in the U.K., Germany, Romania, France and Spain, and just last month we unveiled a \u20ac70 million research and development investment in Ireland.\n\nEurope\u2019s values of openness, innovation, the protection of citizens\u2019 privacy and the rule of law have led to it being the powerhouse of mobile communications that it is today. And we at Huawei share these values.\n\nInnovative European companies have brought 2G, 3G and 4G to European citizens. The lifting of mobile roaming charges has helped Europe\u2019s competitiveness and European consumers.\n\nEurope and Huawei share a vision of technology benefiting consumers and citizens.\n\nAnd the introduction of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an excellent initiative that reinforces the core European value of the privacy of citizens.\n\nWe believe the model applied in GDPR can also be applied in cybersecurity, helping Europe to continue to be a leader in the 5G era.\n\nEurope and Huawei share a vision I believe, of technology benefiting consumers and citizens. Since the company was founded 30 years ago, we have been working to bring digitalization and connectivity to all. We believe it\u2019s no longer a luxury, but a fundamental right. But with rights come responsibilities.\n\nThis is why we actively encourage all stakeholders to take responsibility for improving cybersecurity, and the standards of that security together. And it\u2019s also the reason we have made cybersecurity our top priority at Huawei.\n\nHuawei has an excellent record all over the world. We comply willingly with all local regulations and laws.\n\nThis is why we welcomed the EU-coordinated 5G risk assessment released on October 9. We believe it is an important step toward developing a common approach to cyber-security and delivering safe networks across Europe. As Europe moves into the next phase, we will work closely with everyone to help mitigate any risks that may be identified.\n\nWe have made cyber-security our top priority at Huawei.\n\nWe want your trust \u2014 we understand it is important. But just as important is verification. This is why we want to work with, and are open to suggestions from, all European governments, customers and partners. Verify us, don\u2019t just trust us.\n\nEurope is open and inclusive. It is this openness and inclusivity that allow us to work together effectively. To take it to the next level, we must understand each other\u2019s point of view, and reconcile each other\u2019s interests. This exchange of ideas will move us forward together.\n\nWe are on the cusp of a fourth industrial revolution. A revolution driven by 5G technology, artificial intelligence and technological innovation, the like of which we have never known. The possibilities are endless. And the advantages for consumers and citizens equally so.\n\nHuawei can bring something special to this \u2014 the most advanced 5G technology available. I believe this can unleash Europe\u2019s true industry potential. It is my wish that within the next 20 years, the leading global companies in the tech field will be European.\n\nThe result, I believe, will be a European model for a global digital future based on free and fair competition, rooted in security; then Europe will have achieved true digital sovereignty.\n\nWe can bring something special to this \u2014 the most advanced 5G technology available.\n\nThe first industrial revolution was forged in Europe out of industry. The second and third industrial revolutions were led by the U.S., through mass production and digitalization. Now, I think it is only fitting that the fourth industrial revolution should again see Europe at the forefront \u2014 and I want this to be in partnership with Huawei, a company that shares its vision of a connected world, embracing digital technology, for the benefit of all.\n\nAbraham Liu is Huawei\u2019s chief representative to European institutions and president of its European public affairs and communication office.\n\nAuthors:", "description": "Connectivity is no longer a luxury, but a fundamental right, writes Abraham Liu.", "authors": ["Abraham Liu", "Chief Representative To European Institutions", "President Of European Public Affairs", "Communication Office"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Map_Huawei11-1080x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
