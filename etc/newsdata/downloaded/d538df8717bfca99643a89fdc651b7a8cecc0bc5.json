She said authorities did not believe the man\u2019s injuries were life-threatening. In a printed statement posted Friday night, police said he was in stable condition.\n\nHe was described as 24 years old, but he was not named.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to Donelan, a driver was pulled over after it appeared to an officer that his car was being operated with tags that expired in June.\n\nWhen the officer approached the car, he saw that it was occupied by a man and a girl who appeared to be about six years old. The officer smelled marijuana and thought the smell was coming from the vehicle, Donelan said.\n\nAD\n\nThe spokeswoman said that the man said he had a learner\u2019s permit, but that a check showed his license had been suspended.\n\nAs the officer attempted to copy the vehicle identification number, the driver began shouting at the officer and reached toward a console inside the car, Donelan said.\n\nAfter retreating, the officer summoned help. Following the arrival of the additional officers, police removed the man peacefully from the car, searched him and handcuffed him, Donelan said.\n\nAD\n\nAs the man was being placed into a cruiser, he struck an officer with his left elbow and attempted to flee, Donelan said. She said the arresting officer grabbed an arm of the handcuffed man and flung him to the ground.\n\nHe landed on his neck, Donelan said, and an ambulance took him to a hospital. An acquaintance of the man arrived during the incident and took custody of the child, she said.\n\nAD\n\nIn their posted statement, police said \u201cthe officer grabbed the suspect\u2019s arm as he was fleeing.\u201d It said he fell, landed on the roadway and complained of pain.\n\nIn the written statement police said the officer who made the initial traffic stop recorded part of it on his cruiser\u2019s dash camera. It said the man was out of the camera\u2019s view when he tried to flee and was injured.\n\nAD\n\nPolice said in their posted statement that a knife was found in the center console of the vehicle that had been stopped. They said about 30 grams of marijuana were found in the vehicle.\n\nThe involved officer is on routine administrative leave, the statement said.\n\nNo charges had been filed as of late Friday, Donelan said.\n\nNone of the officers was identified.\n\nAD", "description": "Incident began with a traffic stop, police say.", "authors": ["Clarence Williams", "Local Reporter Covering Crime", "Breaking News", "Public Safety Issues"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/BgevibQJrLgQcuh2TdfJspBhE2Y=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FQ7QY6FHAEI6RLLPBADXBXG5YI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
