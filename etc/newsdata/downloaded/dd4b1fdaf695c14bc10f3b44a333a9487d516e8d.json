(Picture: HBO)\n\nGame of Thrones star Pilou Asb\u00e6k has called on Game of Thrones creator George RR Martin to write an alternative ending for his barbaric villain Euron Greyjoy in the Song of Ice and Fire series, of which the TV adaptation is based.\n\nEuron perished at the hands of Jaime Lannister (played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), who returned to King\u2019s Landing for one last kiss from his lover, sister and mother of his unborn child Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey), before he was stopped in his tracks for a scrap with the biggest monster in Westeros.\n\nJaime managed to escape from Euron, but not before his rival delivered the fatal blow which sealed the Kingslayer\u2019s fate, regardless of King\u2019s Landing later crashing down and crushing his entire family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe finale was divisive, to say the least, but Pilou has proposed a different outcome for his maniac as George is still working on finishing the next title in his literary series.\n\nWhile receiving an Esquire Spain trophy at the annual Men of The Year Awards, the Danish actor released a video, sharing an open letter to Lena and Nikolaj.\n\nTo Lena, he wrote: \u2018I\u2019m in Madrid to receive another award for that delicious romantic comedy we starred in. Lovely memories. I\u2019ve texted George R.R. Martin suggesting him to change that Golden Company s**t for those golden rings.\n\nPilou Asbaek has ideas for George RR Martins next book Picture: Xinhua/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nGeorge, you listening? (Picture: Rex Features)\n\n\u2018The books should end with our wedding, saying yes over two marvelous elephants, ideally. George seems not to be online. Would you mind phoning him? And what about tweeting that I was and will always be the love of your life?\n\n\u2018I miss you. Yours, Pilou. Please do it for your salty boy, blondie.\u2019\n\nHis words to Nikolaj, however, were a little less sentimental:\n\n\u2018You need to clarify in public [that] I was the one who killed you, not the f**king brick. Please, seriously, come on. Confirm it on Twitter, or in your next interview, I don\u2019t give a s**t.\n\nPilou made a plea to make sure we all know who really killed Jaime Lannister (Picture: HBO)\n\n\u2018Oh, by the way, I received the golden hand replica, and you were right: what a feeling! It feels so good, why were you complaining so much on set? It\u2019s great to have a golden hand! Besides that, I\u2019m pretty cool man. Right now I\u2019m in Spain, the most beautiful place in the world.\n\n\u2018All the best, yours, Pilou.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018P.S. Please remember to tell people that I killed you, not the f**king brick.\u2019\n\nWill Pilou get his wish? Only time can tell, but Bran Stark star Isaac Hempstead-Wright, whose hero floored everyone to become ruler of the now Six Kingdoms, recently admitted he\u2019d be \u2018gutted\u2019 if the books to follow the same path as the HBO series.\n\nGame of Thrones seasons one to eight are available to stream on NOW TV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
