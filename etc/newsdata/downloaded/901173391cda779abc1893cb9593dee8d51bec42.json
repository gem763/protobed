He said there will be a time when he will come to a point where he has had \u201cenough,\u201d but those decisions will be coming at the \u201cappropriate times.\u201d\n\nTOM BRADY 'SETTING UP TO MOVE ON' FROM PATRIOTS, NFL INSIDER THEORIZES\n\n\u201cThat is the great part for me, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Brady told WEEI's \"The Greg Hill Show.\" \u201cI think that has been a unique situation that I have been in because I think when you commit to a team for a certain amount of years you kind of feel like [there is] the responsibility to always fulfill the contract.\"\n\nHe added: \u201cFor me, it\u2019s been good because I am just taking it day-by-day and I am enjoying what I have. I don\u2019t know what the future holds and the great part is for me, football at this point is all borrowed time.\u201d\n\nWHY TOM BRADY URINATED ON PRACTICE JERSEY DURING 2006 SEASON\n\nESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter noted earlier this week that Brady\u2019s contract is up at the end of the 2019 season and that he and his trainer, Alex Guerrero, have put their respective homes on the market. Schefter attempted to connect the dots about the Super Bowl-winning quarterback\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s boil this down to the basic facts once again,\u201d Schefter said. \u201cLet\u2019s look at some simple things: Has he put his home for sale? Yes. Has his trainer put his home for sale? Yes. Has he set up his contract to void after this season to become a free agent? Yes. So if he\u2019s selling his home and his trainer is selling his home and he\u2019s voiding his contract? What does that tell you? He\u2019s setting up to move on.\u201d\n\nSchefter added: \u201cThere are many times people set up things in their lives to move on and they walk to the abyss, look down and say, \u2018Whoa, I\u2019m not jumping now.' So he could change his mind.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nSchefter didn\u2019t clarify what \u201cmove on\u201d meant. Whether it means to move on from the Patriots or move on from football altogether was unclear.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the New York Post reported that he was looking to bring his health and wellness brand to New York.", "description": "Tom Brady addressed potential dark clouds on the horizon in his NFL future amid a theory that surfaced about his potential departure from the New England Patriots.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
