I\u2019ve gotten so much energy from her,\u2019 he said. \u2018She has shown me so many things that I never understood.

I feel things I never felt before.\u2019\n\nDespite Travis and Kylie\u2019s shock split after many thought they were set to get married, they\u2019ve made it clear that co-parenting Stormi is their biggest priority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the makeup mogul confirmed that the pair had parted ways, she explained on social media: \u2018Travis and i are on great terms and our main focus right now is Stormi our friendship and our daughter is priority [sic].\u2019\n\nThe duo is putting their daughter first and has agreed to have Stormi spend equal time with both parents.\n\nA source told PEOPLE: \u2018They have split for now and are living apart.

Stormi Saturdays. We don\u2019t f*** around with those.\n\n\u2018Even with me on tour, Stormi pulls up. She\u2019ll travel. She got more stamps on her passport than a lot of motherf***ers.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
