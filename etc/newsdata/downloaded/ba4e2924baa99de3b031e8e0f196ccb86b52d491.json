That's because two streaming apps exist, Foxtel Now and Foxtel Go, and the differences between them seem quite minimal. Foxtel has now announced it's pushing mobile device users to Foxtel Go while Foxtel Now will remain for everything non-mobile like smart TVs and consoles. Here's what you need to know.\n\nEverything You Need To Know About Foxtel's New Deal With Netflix Foxtel has just announced it's offering Netflix content to existing iQ4 customers, rolling out progressively from today. The changes mean two million Foxtel users (out of five million across Australia) who hadn't previously had access to Netflix, will now be able to access the streaming giant's content, according to figures supplied by Roy Morgan. Read more\n\nWhat's the difference between Foxtel Go and Foxtel Now anyway?\n\nUntil now, the differences were quite minor and even a table provided by Foxtel didn't clarify it much further. Essentially, Foxtel Go was a streaming service included for set-top box subscribers so they could travel and still use the service while Foxtel Now was a standalone streaming service. Both subscriptions had their own standalone apps on the Apple Store and Google Play Store.\n\nBut Foxtel Now users could also purchase a Foxtel Now box, if their TV wasn't smart. The box also offered a number of apps such as YouTube, ABC iView and, if they had a subscription, even the Stan app.\n\nIn the latest confusing move, Foxtel will shut down Foxtel Now on smartphones and tablets, but the app will remain on smart TVs and consoles. Moving forward, Foxtel Go will be the primary app on smartphones and tablets and Foxtel Go will replace the app on mobile devices for Foxtel Now subscribers.\n\n\"By focusing on one app, we will also add more value for Foxtel Now customers by providing access to popular features and support from Foxtel Go that were previously unavailable on the Foxtel Now app,\" Foxtel executive Alice Mascia said in a press release.\n\n\"These features include a preview screen to watch show trailers, an expanded Kids homepage and support for Android 10 and iOS 13, providing them with an even better mobile experience.\"\n\nYes, our head hurts too.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nWith the changes expected to be live from 17 September, Foxtel Now customers will be pushed to download the Foxtel Go app for their mobile devices. Foxtel Kids app users will also to need to switch over to Foxtel Go as the Kids app being fully retired in January 2020.\n\nUser experience-wise, the two apps look very similar so previous Now users won't find the migration too challenging.\n\nImage: Foxtel/Lifehacker Australia\n\nWhat remains confusing is that while a person might have a Foxtel Now subscription, they'll need to use the Foxtel Go app if they're using their phone. If they want to stream Foxtel Now through a PlayStation 4, for example, they'll still have to use Foxtel Now.\n\nAnd we leave you with that headache.", "description": "I've always found Foxtel streaming a bit confusing.
