We decided to put ourselves out there \u2013 not knowing what we\u2019d find \u2013 in an effort to chip away at any senseless stigma around this experience and to encourage people who might be going through it to open themselves up to love & support from friends and family when they need it most. Happily, for us \u2013 this time -- we walked out with tears of joy. #AndThenIDancedAQuickStep.\"", "description": "James Van Der Beek announced on \"Dancing with the Stars\" that his wife is pregnant with their sixth baby.", "authors": ["Sasha Savitsky", "You Can Find Sasha Savitsky On Twitter"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Brook20-20Van20Der20Beek20Getty202018.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
