You play against New Zealand, if you try to play them at their game you\u2019re going to come off second best.\n\nJones has played down England\u2019s favourites tag going into next week\u2019s final (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018I thought we stuck to our game really well. Early on in the game, because we were getting some quick ball, we loosened up a little bit and probably missed a couple of opportunities to score, but I thought the discipline of our players was outstanding in attack and defence.\u2019\n\nAsked about England now being favourites to win the tournament, Jones added: \u2018We don\u2019t bet, we don\u2019t look at the bookies, so we\u2019re not really concerned. Our expectations are the most important thing, how we try to get better every day.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Eddie Jones believes England will need to be more ruthless in the Rugby World Cup final and feels his side should have racked up a bigger score in their thumping...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1183516626_1572086715.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
