Only about five should have been there.\n\nThe next day, 12 Democrats took to their various media platforms to claim victories, slam opponents, clarify positions \u2014 and double down on their intents for the long haul. Only about five should have done this.\n\nWhen are the low-pollers going to exit, stage right, while they still have even a smidgen of self-respect left? Cue REO Speedwagon, playing softly in the background, \u201cIt\u2019s Time For Me To Fly.\u201d\n\nAn IBD/TIPP poll from October 7 put Sen. Elizabeth Warren as leader of the pack, with 27%; Joe Biden, ex-vice president, at 26; Sen. Bernie Sanders at 10; Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 7; and Sen. Kamala Harris and businessman Andrew Yang at 3.\n\nThe rest \u2014 Beto O\u2019Rourke, Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker, Tom Steyer, Gabbi Tulsi and Julian Castro, along with the no-namer Michael Bennett \u2014 all registered between 2% and 0%.\n\nZero percent. That should be an automatic boot. The zero-percenters, back on October 7, included Colorado businessman Bennett \u2014 who? \u2014 as well as Booker and Steyer.\n\nThey should never have stayed as long as they have.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if they\u2019ve gained steam, either. By the time the Dems\u2019 fourth debate rolled into focus in Ohio, these same losers were, well, still losers.\n\nAn Economist/YouGov\u2019s poll conducted October 13 through October 15, the day of the debate, had Warren again in the lead, with 29%, followed by Biden, with 25; Sanders, 13; Buttigieg, 7; and Harris, 5. The rest, once again, fell below 2% with voters.\n\nPost-debate, Biden saw a jump \u2014 by 10 percentage points, according to Morning Consult. Warren, meanwhile, fell a bit in favor, but still carried a substantial amount of support, with 21%. Sanders saw an 18% poll showing, while Harris and Buttigieg garnered 7% and 6%, respectively.\n\nAnd as for the rest? Losers, all.\n\n\u201c[W]hat happened onstage in Westerville, Ohio, did little to change the state of the race,\u201d Morning Consult reported. \u201cFirst-choice support for all of the candidates on the stage did not change beyond 1 percentage point.\u201d\n\nThat leaves the big question: When are these Club Zero members going to awaken to their teeny digit favor? Even CNN is wondering.\n\nIn a shockingly honest assessment of debaters\u2019 performances, the normally leftist-leaning, see-no-Democrat-evil, report-no-Democrat-evil cable outlet wrote this, of their one-time bestie O\u2019Rourke: \u201cIt\u2019s not at all clear to us that the former Texas congressman understands his current peril in this race. He hasn\u2019t qualified for the November debate and, if his performance in [this fourth debate] is any indication, he probably won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHe probably won\u2019t.\n\nBeto should leave the race now. So, too, this list \u2014 which is shorter to write this way: Everybody but Biden, Warren, Sanders, Buttigieg and Harris.\n\nOnly two, maybe three, of those names have shots at perhaps winning the party\u2019s presidential nomination. The others, ostensibly, could keep on the trail, though, as a way of gathering name recognition \u2014 and funding \u2014 for a possible vice presidential slot. Or a potential Cabinet role.\n\nOf course, the Democrats\u2019 real challenge is finding a candidate who can, in the end, beat President Donald Trump. And on that, even their current front-runners hold dubious ability.\n\nThe party knows it, too.\n\n\u201cPanicky Democrats beg Michelle Obama to run,\u201d one Fox News headline reported earlier this month.\n\nTranslation: You know it\u2019s pretty bad for Democrats when they pin their presidential hopes on someone who\u2019s not even running for the office.\n\nCome to think of it, maybe REO works as a theme song for the whole party.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
