The report alleged that 300 racehorses were killed there over a 22-day period.\n\nIt also broadcast covertly taken footage which appeared to show horses being beaten and mistreated in other ways.\n\nSome of the meat from slaughtered animals was exported for human consumption in countries in Asia and Europe, the report said.\n\nNew South Wales Racing Minister Kevin Anderson said the footage had made those involved in the sport \"sick to their stomach\".\n\nRacing Australia, the national industry body, added it should lead to prosecutions.\n\nBut the national body said it did not have the ability to track racehorses after they retired from competition. It reiterated calls for a national register to be established.\n\nAbout 8,500 horses nationally are retired from the track each year. Racing Australia said it believed less than 1% of such animals ended up in an abattoir.\n\nThe industry has long drawn criticism from animal welfare groups such as the RSPCA, which on Friday said officials had \"lost control\" over how horses were managed.\n\n\"Racing authorities repeatedly claim that animal welfare is 'paramount', yet they don't want to admit that racehorses are being slaughtered,\" it said in a statement.\n\nTens of thousands of people are expected to attend Australia's spring racing events. The nation's most prestigious race, the Melbourne Cup, will be held on 5 November.", "description": "It will examine allegations of animal cruelty, after a television report caused widespread anger.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/116DB/production/_109278317_11611904-3x2-940x627.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
