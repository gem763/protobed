The authors said that the monkeys\u2019 appetite for rodents showed that rather than being pests, as is commonly believed, the primates\u2019 presence reduced crop losses.\n\n\u201cI was stunned when I first observed that macaques feed on rats in plantations,\u201d said Nadine Ruppert, senior zoology lecturer at University Sains Malaysia, who co-wrote the report. \u201cI did not expect them to hunt these relatively large rodents or that they would even eat so much meat.\u201d\n\nFrom rainforest to your cupboard: the real story of palm oil - interactive Read more\n\nThe report monitored macaques between January 2016 and September 2018 in plantations around Malaysia\u2019s Segari Melintang forest reserve. It showed that each of the monitored macaque groups, featuring an average of 44 monkeys, killed around 3,000 rats each year. Rats are estimated to damage an average of 10% of oil palm crops by eating its fruit, compared with the macaques which damage 0.54%. As a result, the authors said that, overall, the rat-eating monkeys help save crops.\n\nMalaysia creates around 19.5m tons of palm oil per year \u2013 the world\u2019s most popular vegetable oil \u2013 making it one of the biggest producers of the product globally. It is used in many products, from shampoo to lipstick to bread and chocolate. It is also a cleaning agent and is used as a component in fuels such as biodiesel.\n\nPlantations\u2019 effects on forests and peatlands and the wild animals that live there have made them hugely controversial. Large areas are often burned and cleared to make way for the plantations, releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\nSouthern pig-tailed macaques are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, but are regularly shot by palm oil plantation staff in Malaysia. The report authors hope their findings will help reduce such behaviour and promote a \u201cwin-win solution\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur results suggest important opportunities for mitigating human-wildlife conflicts,\u201d they wrote. \u201cFarmers and palm oil companies are encouraged to protect primates in their natural habitat via wildlife corridors between forest patches and viable interfaces between forests and plantations.\u201d", "description": "Animals act as natural pest control on Malaysia\u2019s vast palm oil plantations, reducing crop losses from rodents", "authors": ["Jamie Fullerton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/906dce09e1977043551b00fdd3f0258790a2daf1/0_311_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b69bd09928d2150a9a477f3e19597eed", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
