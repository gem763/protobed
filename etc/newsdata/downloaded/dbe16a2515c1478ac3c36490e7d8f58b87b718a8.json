If Tammy Abraham scores he stays in the team and for me, Mason Mount is good enough to stay in the side.\n\n\u2018Callum Hudson-Odoi has signed a new contract and so will feature, Willian is back in good form and Jorginho has been great.\n\n\u2018Fikayo Tomori is also playing well, but I am not sure whether the Chelsea centre-backs have a partnership to cope with Ashley Barnes and Chris Wood when they get the service that they do.\n\n\u2018If there is an upset of the weekend then I am looking at this match. The Burnley style may not be attractive to some people but it is so effective. Burnley 2-1 Chelsea.\u2019\n\nChelsea beat Champions League rivals Ajax during the week (Picture: Getty)\n\nChelsea clinched an impressive victory over Ajax on Wednesday night and Lampard said it was evidence of his \u2018babies\u2019 coming of age.\n\nThe former Chelsea and England midfielder said: \u2018I\u2019m delighted with every element of the performance.\n\n\u2018I think we\u2019re allowed to be excited tonight. That\u2019s the blueprint. There are no excuses for us now. That\u2019s the standard and we can\u2019t drop it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The young players are still babies in terms of Champions League minutes so this was a huge test for them.\n\n\u2018There was a good balance of young players and experience. We need to realise the things that made that happen tonight because Ajax are a top, top team.\u2019\n\nBurnley are currently eighth in the Premier League having amassed 12 points from their first nine games of the season.\n\nMORE: Arsenal legend mocks two players and slams Unai Emery", "description": "Arsenal hero Charlie Nicholas has explained why he believes Frank Lampard's Chelsea will lose to Burnley in the Premier League this weekend.
