The lung cancer was quite a shock, I haven't smoked for decades and decades,\" she said during an appearance on the show in October 2016.\n\n\"Normally people are diagnosed later. It came honestly out of the blue.\n\n\"I was vegetarian, I don\u2019t drink that much. I was fit for my age.\"\n\nIn her blog, Something Beginning With C, the actress and yoga teacher railed against the lack of research dedicated to lung cancer, asking if it was because of the stigma attached to the disease.\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n\"I myself have smoked in the past. And no one can make me feel more guilty about that than I did, let me tell you,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Even when I was told that the type of lung cancer with which I was diagnosed was not caused by smoking, it was a bitter sweet revelation, and let's be honest, it can't have helped. But to fail to fairly fund research into detection, screening, treatments etc due to prejudice seems to be almost inhuman.\"\n\nShe went on: \"The nature of life is such that we mortals do do things that are not good for us, we drink, we smoke, we take drugs, we over eat, we don't excercise etc etc, and that all has health consequences, do we stand by and judge everyone and smear them with prejudice?\n\n\"If a person has skin cancer, are they blamed or shamed because they didn't use sunscreen?\"\n\n(Image: Leah's Cancer Fund)\n\nLeah added: \"Every year thousands of people are dying from lung cancer, and maybe we don't all need to! So, do check yourself out if you have concerns.\n\n\"We need to raise awareness of the disease and inequality surrounding funding for lung cancer, to motivate the government to address the shortcomings, welcome early screening initiatives, and extinguish prejudice.\"\n\nHer call to arms came too late for Leah, but her legacy and painfully raw writing about cancer has helped spread awareness of the disease.\n\nLeah leaves behind her husband Jez Hughes and her two adult daughters, Lily and Maya, who confirmed her death in a heartbreaking statement.\n\n\"It is with the deepest sadness that Leah Bracknell's family confirm that Leah passed away in September, three years after her diagnosis with stage 4 lung cancer,\" they said.\n\n(Image: ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n\"They would like to thank all the public for their support and generosity which contributed to the extension and quality of her life over the past three years.\n\n\"Leah continued to embrace life and faced her illness with positivity. Many aspects of her journey can be found on her blog.\n\n\"Leah was best known and much loved as Zoe Tate in Emmerdale.\n\n\"She also had roles in Judge John Deed, A Touch of Frost, The Royal Today and DCI Banks to name just a few, as well as numerous appearances on stage and in pantomime.\n\n\"As well as acting, Leah was also an accomplished yoga teacher and shamanic healer.\n\n\"Leah had an energy and enthusiasm for life, a kind heart and much love to give to those around her.\n\n\"Her family have asked for privacy at this very sad time.\"", "description": "Emmerdale star Leah Bracknell, who died in September three years after being diagnosed, had told fans she hadn't smoked for years before she fell ill", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex Shutterstock", "Leah'S Cancer Fund", "Itv Rex Shutterstock"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13373651.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Leah-Bracknell.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
