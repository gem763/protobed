However, I would not necessarily consider the 3% guarantee unimportant or inconsequential.\n\nIn my state, many decades ago, they had the wisdom of setting up the pension system in such a way that pension benefits are linked to how the underlying investments do. Their only guarantee is this: In the future, your pension will never drop below the initial pension amount you received upon retirement. They can also increase or decrease retirement contributions (or deductions) from active employees on an annual basis depending on how things are going.\n\nEven health plan benefits were carefully designed in my state. Upon retirement, they tell you how much \"money\" you have for health plan premiums depending on various factors. Once it is exhausted, that's it. You can have the premium deductions paid from your pension if you want. If that is not enough, you may have to pay some out-of-pocket money as well. The other option is to say good-bye to the state-administered health insurance and be on your own to make other arrangements. But no lifetime health benefits guarantee.", "description": "I just have to believe TIAA, among many others, has to relieve the stress of future guarantees. - 19826", "authors": ["Participant", "Explorer", "Contributor"], "top_image": "https://zwcdr85544.i.lithium.com/html/assets/favicon.ico?15D4DC4041FDD3CD56F6121736C9C68D"}
