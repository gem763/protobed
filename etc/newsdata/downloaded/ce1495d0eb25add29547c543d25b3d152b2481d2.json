As Trump led a meeting today devoted to conditions in Venezuela, the White House released internal notes of his phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart in July in which he called for an investigation into the 2020 Democratic presidential front-runner, Joe Biden.\n\nThe notes show that Trump brought up Biden unprompted. He then made reference to what he and his outside lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, have sought to spotlight in the run-up to the 2020 election: Biden\u2019s efforts to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor, and son Hunter Biden\u2019s work with a Ukrainian energy company. Biden had wanted the prosecutor dismissed as part of a broader push against corruption in Ukraine, and no evidence has emerged of any wrongdoing on the part of the Bidens.\n\n\u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me,\u201d Trump said in his conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. \u201cI will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General [William] Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nDemocrats recoiled at the conversation. Representative Adam Schiff of California, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, tweeted that Trump sounded like a \u201cmob boss\u201d sending a message that was unmistakably \u201ca shakedown.\u201d\n\nAt the news conference, Trump said he had done nothing wrong and that he\u2019d applied \u201cno pressure\u201d to Zelensky. Trotting out lines he used to discredit the Mueller investigation, he called the new probe \u201ca hoax.\u201d Earlier in the day, Trump sat side by side with Zelensky at a bilateral meeting. What was supposed to be a routine photo opportunity turned into a joint news conference of sorts. Speaking English, the Ukrainian leader, a one-time comedian and actor, said he hadn\u2019t felt pressured by Trump to look into the Biden family.\n\n\u201cIt was normal, we spoke about many things,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cSo, I think, and you read, that nobody pushed me.\u201d\n\nTrump jumped in: \u201cIn other words, no pressure.\u201d Yet seconds later, he signaled that he still wants Zelensky to probe the Biden family. \u201cI want him to do whatever he can,\u201d Trump told reporters.\n\nRepublicans are largely standing by Trump, as my colleague Elaina Plott has reported. If the House votes to impeach him, the Republican-controlled Senate would conduct a trial, with a two-thirds vote needed to convict. Only minor fissures in the GOP ranks have emerged so far. Republican Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, in an appearance today at The Atlantic Festival in Washington, D.C., said he had read the White House\u2019s rough notes on the Trump-Zelensky call and found them \u201cdeeply troubling.\u201d Yet another Republican senator I talked to today, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations, told me that his GOP colleagues are \u201cgiddy\u201d and see \u201cnothing incriminating\u201d in the notes.", "description": "The president\u2019s first address to the UN was full of fire and fury.
