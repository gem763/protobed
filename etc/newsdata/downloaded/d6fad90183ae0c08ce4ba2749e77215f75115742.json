Alex Mason, founder of the Aberdeen Life Ethics Society, which was also only set up this year, said they have received threats saying milkshake will be thrown over them.\n\nSpeaking to The Independent, Mr Mason said: \u201cThere was a small protest demonstration against our presence at Freshers\u2019 Fayre and we got some dirty looks from certain people who passed by, but overall we had a productive time of engagement and interaction with our fellow students.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Those are the ideas we need to challenge. I think the best way to counter pro-life activism on campus is to support pro-choice organisations and feminist societies on campus.\u201d\n\nShe added that if new students arrive at university and see \u201cgraphic images designed to shame\u201d them at freshers\u2019 fairs then that will be \u201cvery distressing\u201d and make them feel like their campus is not safe.\n\n\u201cThere is potential for pro-life societies on campus to cause great distress to students and that\u2019s something we have to be very careful about. We need to ensure it doesn\u2019t cause division on campus.\n\nMs Watters said it should be down to individual student unions to decide how they handle pro-life societies - such as bans and freshers\u2019 fair messaging - but she stressed students\u2019 welfare was vital.\n\nAn EHRC spokesperson said: \u201cUniversities must be a bastion of free speech providing open, inclusive forums for learning and debate.\n\n\u201cWe know that abortion rights are a highly contested issue, and universities also have to consider equality obligations, but preventing pro-life societies from affiliating with student unions may go against a university\u2019s obligation to protect freedom of speech on campus.\u201d\n\nAn OfS spokesperson added: \u201cWe will never seek to limit freedom of speech within the law, and we will only use our powers to promote rather than restrict it.\n\n\u201cUniversities are places where people can encounter challenging and \u2013 at times \u2013 uncomfortable ideas, and see those ideas questioned, sometimes for the first time. This is something we should encourage.\u201d", "description": "The number of anti-abortion student societies launching across the country has mushroomed, campaigners claim, as the pressures on universities to protect free speech grow.", "authors": ["Eleanor Busby"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/18/11/pro-life-abortion-alabama.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
