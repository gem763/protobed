It\u2019s no surprise that the government is working on the fly, and the improvisation has some costs.\u201d\n\nThe central bank has been selling dollars at a faster pace in an effort to contain a sharp depreciation of the Argentine peso. Mr. Carugati said reserves have fallen by $12.2 billion since Aug. 9, or about 20% of foreign-currency reserves. The peso has shed more than 20% of its value since Mr. Macri suffered a crushing setback in a primary vote on Aug. 11. Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, the presidential candidate of the nationalist Peronist coalition, and his running mate, former President Cristina Kirchner, emerged as the broad favorites to win the Oct. 27 election, which would threaten Mr. Macri\u2019s austerity policies. Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez told The Wall Street Journal last week that Argentina was in a \u201cvirtual default.\u201d The government responded to the backlash from voters by freezing gas prices, increasing the minimum wage and providing a bonus payment to state workers as Mr. Macri seeks to win support ahead of the election. In a decree released on Sunday, the government said the central bank would limit dollar sales, requiring companies and banks authorization to purchase hard currency. The country\u2019s exporters would be required to repatriate all hard currency from sales abroad. Individuals seeking to buy dollars will have a limit of $10,000 per month. Bank transfers abroad by individuals will also face a monthly limit of $10,000. Dollar purchases by nonresidents will be restricted to $1,000 a month, and they won\u2019t be allowed to make bank transfers abroad. Given the recent financial-market turmoil and political uncertainty, it is \u201cnecessary to adopt temporary and urgent measures to regulate the foreign-exchange market with greater intensity and strengthen the normal functioning of the economy,\u201d the decree said. The goal, the government added, is to \u201creduce financial-market volatility and contain the impact of fluctuations in financial flows on the economy.\u201d Write to Santiago P\u00e9rez at santiago.perez@wsj.com and Ryan Dube at ryan.dube@dowjones.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
