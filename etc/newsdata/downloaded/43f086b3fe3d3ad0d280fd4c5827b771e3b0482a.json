They\u2019re a joke. They\u2019re a laughingstock,\u201d Trump told reporters outside the White House before departing for a rally in North Carolina.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFormer South Carolina governor and congressman Mark Sanford on Sunday became the third Republican candidate to announce plans to compete with Trump for the party\u2019s nomination \u2014 or at least blunt the president\u2019s momentum heading into the general election.\n\nSanford is joined by conservative radio show host and former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh, and former Massachusetts governor and 2016 Libertarian vice presidential nominee William Weld.\n\nAsked whether he was willing to debate the Republicans running against him, Trump responded, \u201cI don't know them\u201d \u2014 going on to mock their polling numbers and tout his significant support among GOP voters.\n\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s a publicity stunt,\u201d Trump said of his rivals\u2019 campaigns, adding: \u201cTo be honest, I'm not looking to give them any credibility. They have no credibility.\u201d\n\nTrump also contended he had \u201cnothing to do with\u201d Republican officials in Arizona, Kansas, Nevada and South Carolina moving in recent days to abandon their nominating contests next year, which he criticized as \u201cvery expensive\u201d for state parties. POLITICO reported last week that the maneuvers will help cut off oxygen to the president\u2019s long-shot primary challengers.\n\n\u201cThe four states that canceled it don't want to waste their money. If there was a race, they would certainly want to do that, but they are considered to be a laughingstock,\u201d Trump said, again blasting his opponents.\n\n", "description": "\u201cThe three people are a total joke.
