The poor man just can\u2019t catch a break \u2014 no matter where he goes, something (or someone) wrecks his cart and sends his cabbages everywhere. \u201cMY CABBAGES!\u201d he screams every time.\n\nYou, presumably, have no issues transporting your cabbages from the market to your house, and therefore have little excuse for not cooking them enough! Cabbage tends to get the short end of the stick as an unglamorous vegetable, with little regard for its versatility, deliciousness and ability to last forever in the fridge in case you can\u2019t use up a whole head in one go.\n\nThese recipes are the some of the best ways to take cabbage to the next level \u2014 let us know your favorite way to use cabbage!\n\nCabbage Escabeche (Nacho Slaw), above.
