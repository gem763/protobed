Now a wooded cycle path beside restless urban railway lines, the wide space under the bridge on Bornholmer Strasse was for 28 years part of the \u201cDeath Strip\u201d in between the two sides of the Berlin Wall. It was here, too, on 9 November 1989, that the Cold War came to an abrupt end as hopeful East Berliners breached the border and crossed the bridge above us to the west.\n\n\u201cAt every point, the story of the Berlin Wall is how little we humans understand the consequences of our actions,\u201d my guide Dr Lauren van Vuuren says, her voice muffled by the electrical whirring of a passing S-bahn train.\n\nWhile the majority of the physical wall has long since been dismantled, the lingering memory of the Berlin Wall is back in the spotlight this year as the city marks the 30th anniversary of its demise. It\u2019s possible to cycle or walk the length of its 96-mile course around West Berlin, but I went for a bike tour along one of its most historically significant sections.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The Fernsehturm, Berlin\u2019s 1960s TV tower, peers at us over the socialist-era apartment blocks, ever omnipresent on the city skyline like an all-seeing eye.\n\n\u201cWherever the Berlin Wall ran, it really strangled the city and both the eastern and western sides became very derelict,\u201d Van Vuuren continues as we draw closer to the park through the now trendy neighbourhood of Prenzlauer Berg. As we do, we catch sight of the new, modern housing blocks springing up on what was no man\u2019s land between east and west.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

During its near 30-year-long existence, those who once lived where the barbed wire and concrete sprang up were evicted and replaced with socialist ideologues and GDR patriots.\n\nThree decades on from reunification, the long shadow of developers and landlords are pricing out the older, working class communities who can no longer afford to pay the rocketing rents ushered in by gentrification and are being scattered throughout the city. In 2018, for instance, Berlin came top of the list of cities with the world\u2019s fastest rent increases.\n\nIn the park itself, hipsters slouch in the summer sunshine on its slopes. Behind them, among crooked birch trees, we find our first tangible traces of the wall itself emblazoned with bright graffiti.\n\nAlthough Berlin today is almost unrecognisable as the divided city it once was \u2013 most physical evidence of its disunity has been reclaimed by property developers \u2013 residents are reluctant to forget. \u201cWhere nothing has been done, birch trees have grown. So, you can follow the line of the Berlin Wall for kilometres through the city through these amazing, narrow little birch forests,\u201d Van Vuuren says. \u201cI find it very moving. It\u2019s almost like the city grew its own memorial to the wall.\u201d\n\nHaving grown up under apartheid in South Africa in the comfort of white, middle-class suburbia and detached from scenes of burning townships and rioting, the historian perhaps knows only too well how conditioned life would have been in the shadow of the wall. \u201cIf you live in a society where the government has the power to control knowledge,\u201d she says solemnly, \u201cyou can be in a situation where you are completely ignorant to your situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWest Berliners lived inside the wall; they were actually free,\u201d she adds. \u201cEast Germans lived on the outside of the wall and they were prisoners in their own country.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the living who were repressed by the East German regime. The dead also fell prey to the wall being built indiscriminately through graveyards, as I see at the Invalidenfriedhof. The traditional resting place for Germany\u2019s military heroes (and some infamous Nazi figures), the cemetery was cleft in two, narrowly missing the grave of fighter ace, Manfred von Richthofen, or the \u201cRed Baron\u201d as he is better known. His tomb, which was in the \u201cDeath Strip\u201d, still clearly bears bullet holes from shots fired at attempted escapees.\n\nPushing on through a woodland park, where the Nordbahnhof station once stood before it too fell victim to the wall\u2019s construction, we circle back towards our last stop at the the official Berlin Wall memorial site on Bernauer Strasse. Cycling along the wall really opens up Berlin in a way that walking just can\u2019t, taking you away from the thronged tourist spots to trace the course of a once divided city which is still reconnecting through the districts most impacted.\n\nOn Bernauer Strasse, almost a mile of the border strip (some of which has been picked clean like a carcass by \u201cwall pickers\u201d scavenging for keepsakes) is preserved in perpetuity. Here the \u201cDeath Strip\u201d, now devoid of tripwire, machine guns, dog patrols and all but one of its watchtowers, is an open space of pristine lawns between the street where the wall ran and the apartment blocks on either side. The green fault line on which we\u2019re now standing is the focus of reconciliation, with a chapel and a museum built to educate future generations.\n\nPerhaps the most poignant section of the memorial is the Window of Remembrance installation, from which the faces of those who died trying to escape to the west peer out from black and white pictures. There was no discrimination when it came to the 140 or so Berliners killed along the wall. Holger H was just 15 months old when he died escaping with his parents. Olga Segler was 80.\n\n\u201cWhen you think of Germans, you think 6 million dead. So, you\u2019d think 140 is not that much. But when you think that these people literally died trying to get from here to there in their own city...\u201d Van Vuuren breaks off. \u201cEach death is a tragedy.\u201d\n\nTravel essentials\n\nEasyJet flies to Berlin from \u00a320.99 one way.\n\nThe Berlin Wall Bike Tour with Berlin on Bike! takes 3.5 hours and costs \u20ac19 plus \u20ac5 for the bike hire.\n\nFor more information on the week-long programme of events commemorating the fall of the Berlin Wall from 4-10 November, visit visitberlin.de.", "description": "Braking to a halt, it\u2019s strange to think that stepping on the ground beneath my tyres would have meant certain death 30 years ago.
