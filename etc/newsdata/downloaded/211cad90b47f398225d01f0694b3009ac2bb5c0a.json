Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is an infection spread by tick bites. According to the NHS, it is not found in the UK but is present in other parts of Europe, Russia, China and Japan. Symptoms can be flu-like, such as feeling hot, headaches, aching muscles and nausea. Some also develop a circular red rash. In severe cases, TBE can cause brain inflammation, which may lead to sufferers experiencing a stiff neck, dislike of bright lights, seizures, behavioural changes or loss of movement. Ticks live in forests and grassy areas. Therefore people may be more at risk if they are hiking or camping, however, not all ticks spread TBE. If visiting an area with TBE, people can get vaccinated against the virus, with two jabs offering around a year's protection. This vaccine is not available on the NHS.\n\nUntil now, the virus had never been found in the UK. However, it is prevalent in most regions of Europe, China and Japan.\n\nTicks, small parasitic arachnids, are growing increasingly common in parts of the UK, mainly due to increasing deer numbers.\n\nAs well as living on deer, ticks can be found on other animals, such as cats, dogs and urban foxes.\n\nTicks, which can be about the size of a pin head, can also live on plants and long grass and grab onto people who brush past them with exposed skin. They bite by burying their head into the flesh and sucking blood from inside.\n\nIn addition to the encephalitis virus carried by around 10 per cent of ticks, they can also carry other diseases, including Lyme disease. They can also cause you to develop a potentially deadly allergy to meat.\n\nDr Nick Phin of PHE said: 'These are early research findings and indicate the need for further work.\n\n'However, the risk to the general public is currently assessed to be very low.'\n\nAccording to the Encephalitis Society, a charity which supports people affected by all types of encephalitis, less than two per cent of people die from the viral infection.\n\nThe illness begins with flu-like symptoms before progressing to a more serious second phase with meningitis and swelling of the brain in a quarter of cases.\n\nMost patients with tick-borne encephalitis will recover, but a third may suffer long-term complications, including convulsions and paralysis.\n\nThere are no specific treatments for TBE, but preventative measures can be taken, including wearing long-sleeved tops and applying insect repellent. A vaccine exists - but it is not available on the NHS.\n\nThe small parasitic arachnids are becoming more common in parts of the UK, mainly due to increasing deer numbers\n\nCOULD TICK-BORNE ENCEPHALITIS BE IN THE LAKE DISTRICT? Public Health England is investigating how common the infected ticks may be, after it found them in Thetford Forest and on the Hampshire-Dorset border. It comes after a dog walker last year claimed he caught tick-borne encephalitis while walking his dog near Millom in the Lake District. Tom Varga's symptoms only came to light 10 months after he was bitten, when he began experiencing extreme fatigue, headaches and eye pain. The sous chef was diagnosed with tick-born encephalitis. However, he admitted it was impossible to rule out he caught it in his native Hungary.\n\nThe tick-borne encephalitis virus is already present in mainland Europe and parts of Asia. It is thought infected ticks may have arrived in the UK through migratory birds.\n\nExperts have suggested rising temperatures caused by global warming are driving ticks northwards.\n\n'We are reminding people to be \"tick aware\" and take tick precautions, particularly when visiting or working in areas with long grass such as woodlands, moorlands and parks,' Dr Phin told the BBC.\n\nThe NHS advises that tick bites can be prevented by covering skin while walking outdoors, using existing paths and nature trails, applying insect repellent and checking your clothes and hair after going for a walk.\n\nIt comes after a dog walker last year claimed he caught tick-borne encephalitis while walking his dog near Millom in the Lake District.\n\nTom Varga's symptoms only came to light 10 months after he was bitten, when he began experiencing extreme fatigue, headaches and eye pain.\n\nThe sous chef was diagnosed with tick-born encephalitis. However, he admitted it was impossible to rule out he caught it in his native Hungary.\n\nThousands of English football fans were warned about the risk of catching tick-borne encephalitis during the World Cup in Russia last summer.\n\nThe Encephalitis Society claimed the ticks can be found in Kaliningrad, Volgograd and Nizhny Novgorod - where England played their three group games.\n\nAva Easton, chief executive of the charity, warned they are a 'serious health concern' for up to 20,000 English travellers expected to make the journey.", "description": "Public Health England has confirmed the presence of the tick-borne encephalitis virus in Thetford Forest, Norfolk and on the Hampshire-Dorset border.", "authors": ["Stephen Matthews Health Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/08/20315810-0-image-a-100_1572337435715.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
