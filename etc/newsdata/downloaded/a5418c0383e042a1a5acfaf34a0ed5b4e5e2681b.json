Turkish jets also carried out at least one airstrike.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitoring group, reported that Syrian Kurdish fighters had retaken the town.\n\nTurkish media reports said Turkey\u2019s military was responding to attempts by the Kurdish fighters to infiltrate Ras al-Ayn.\n\nThe renewed battle for the border town follows the deployment of Syria\u2019s army near the Turkish border, after Syrian Kurdish forces - saying they had been abandoned by their U.S. ally - reached a deal with President Bashar Assad\u2019s government to help them fend off Turkey\u2019s invasion.\n\nAssad\u2019s return to the region his troops abandoned in 2012 at the height of the Syrian civil war is a turning point in the conflict, giving yet another major boost to his government and its Russian backers and is like to endanger, if not altogether crush, the brief experiment in self-rule set up by Syria\u2019s Kurds since the conflict began.\n\nWashington said Trump was sending Vice President Mike Pence and national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien to Ankara as soon as possible in an attempt to begin negotiations over a stop to the fighting. Pence said Trump spoke directly to Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who promised not to attack the border town of Kobani, which in 2015 witnessed the Islamic State group\u2019s first defeat in a battle by U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters.\n\nA Turkish military official, meanwhile denied reports that Turkey had begun an assault on the Kurdish-held town of Manbij, without giving further detail.\n\nThe Manbij region is home to U.S. outposts that were set up in 2017 to patrol the tense frontiers between Turkish-controlled areas and the Kurdish-held side of northern Syria. A U.S. official said troops are still in the town, preparing to leave.\n\nOn Monday Syrian fighters backed by Turkey had said they had started an offensive to capture Manbij, which is on the western flank of the Euphrates River, broadening their campaign east of the river.\n\nErdogan for his part defended Turkey\u2019s offensive in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, calling on the international community to support Turkey\u2019s effort to create what it calls a resettlement \u201csafe zone\u201d for refugees in northeast Syria, or \u201cbegin admitting refugees.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurkey reached its limit,\u201d Erdogan wrote in reference to 3.6 million Syrian refugees in his country. He said Turkey\u2019s warnings that it would not be able to stop refugee floods into the West without international support \u201cfell on deaf ears.\u201d\n\n__\n\nMroue reported from Beirut.
