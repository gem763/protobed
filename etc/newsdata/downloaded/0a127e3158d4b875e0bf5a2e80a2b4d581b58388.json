Col. Alexander S. Vindman of the Army, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, twice registered internal objections about how Mr. Trump and his inner circle were treating Ukraine, out of what he called a \u201csense of duty,\u201d he plans to tell the inquiry, according to a draft of his opening statement obtained by The New York Times.\n\nHe will be the first White House official to testify who listened in on the July 25 telephone call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine that is at the center of the impeachment inquiry, in which Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nSign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter\n\n\u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\u201d Colonel Vindman said in his statement. \u201cI realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained.\u201d\n\nBurisma Holdings is an energy company on whose board Mr. Biden\u2019s son served while his father was vice president.\n\n\u201cThis would all undermine U.S. national security,\u201d Colonel Vindman added, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s comments in the call.\n\nThe colonel, a Ukrainian-American immigrant who received a Purple Heart after being wounded in Iraq by a roadside bomb and whose statement is full of references to duty and patriotism, could be a more difficult witness to dismiss than his civilian counterparts.\n\n\u201cI am a patriot,\u201d Colonel Vindman plans to tell the investigators, \u201cand it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend our country irrespective of party or politics.\u201d\n\nHe was to be interviewed privately on Tuesday by the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform Committees, in defiance of a White House edict not to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe colonel, who is represented by Michael Volkov, a former federal prosecutor, declined to comment for this article.\n\nIn his testimony, Colonel Vindman plans to say that he is not the whistle-blower who initially reported Mr. Trump\u2019s pressure campaign on Ukraine. But he will provide an account that corroborates and fleshes out crucial elements in that complaint, which prompted Democrats to open their impeachment investigation.\n\n\u201cI did convey certain concerns internally to national security officials in accordance with my decades of experience and training, sense of duty, and obligation to operate within the chain of command,\u201d he plans to say.\n\nHe will testify that he watched with alarm as \u201coutside influencers\u201d began pushing a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d about Ukraine that was counter to the consensus view of American national security officials, and harmful to United States interests. According to documents reviewed by The Times on the eve of his congressional testimony, Colonel Vindman was concerned as he discovered that Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, was leading an effort to prod Kiev to investigate Mr. Biden\u2019s son, and to discredit efforts to investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and his business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nHis account strongly suggests that he may have been among the aides the whistle-blower referred to in his complaint when he wrote that White House officials had recounted the conversation between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky to him, and \u201cwere deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call.\u201d\n\nColonel Vindman did not interact directly with the president, but was present for a series of conversations that shed light on his pressure campaign on Ukraine.\n\nHe will also testify that he confronted Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, the day the envoy spoke in a White House meeting with Ukrainian officials about \u201cUkraine delivering specific investigations in order to secure the meeting with the president.\u201d\n\nEven as he expressed alarm about the pressure campaign, the colonel and other officials worked to keep the United States relationship with Ukraine on track. At the direction of his superiors at the National Security Council, including John R. Bolton, then the national security adviser, Colonel Vindman drafted a memorandum in mid-August that sought to restart security aid that was being withheld from Ukraine, but Mr. Trump refused to sign it, according to documents reviewed by the Times. And he drafted a letter in May congratulating Mr. Zelensky on his inauguration, but Mr. Trump did not sign that either, according to the documents.\n\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 3 NEXT SLIDE > The colonel also plans to testify that he confronted Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union. \u00a9 Erin Schaff/The New York Times\n\nColonel Vindman was concerned after he learned that the White House budget office had taken the unusual step of withholding the $391 million package of security assistance for Ukraine that had been approved by Congress. At least one previous witness has testified that Mr. Trump directed that the aid be frozen until he could secure a commitment from Mr. Zelensky to announce an investigation of the Bidens.\n\nWhile Colonel Vindman\u2019s concerns were shared by a number of other officials, some of whom have already testified, he was in a unique position. Because he emigrated from Ukraine along with his family when he was a child and is fluent in Ukrainian and Russian, Ukrainian officials sought advice from him about how to deal with Mr. Giuliani, though they typically communicated in English.\n\nOn two occasions, the colonel brought his concerns to John A. Eisenberg, the top lawyer at the National Security Council. The first came on July 10. That day, senior American officials met with senior Ukrainian officials at the White House, in a stormy meeting in which Mr. Bolton is said to have had a tense exchange with Mr. Sondland after the ambassador raised the matter of investigations he wanted Ukraine to undertake. That meeting has been described in previous testimony in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAt a debriefing later that day attended by the colonel, Mr. Sondland again urged Ukrainian officials to help with investigations into Mr. Trump\u2019s political rivals.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland emphasized the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma,\u201d Colonel Vindman said in his draft statement.\n\n\u201cI stated to Ambassador Sondland that his statements were inappropriate\u201d and that the \u201crequest to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the N.S.C. was going to get involved in or push,\u201d he added.\n\nThe colonel\u2019s account echoed the testimony of Fiona Hill, one of his superiors, who has previously testified behind closed doors that she and Mr. Bolton were angered by efforts to politicize the interactions with Ukraine.\n\nThe colonel said that after his confrontation with Mr. Sondland, \u201cDr. Hill then entered the room and asserted to Ambassador Sondland that his statements were inappropriate.\u201d\n\nMs. Hill, the former senior director for European and Russian affairs, also reported the incident to Mr. Eisenberg.\n\nThe colonel went to Mr. Eisenberg a couple of weeks later, after the president\u2019s call with Mr. Zelensky. This time, the colonel was accompanied by his identical twin brother, Yevgeny, who is a lawyer on the National Security Council.\n\nThe picture painted by Colonel Vindman\u2019s testimony has been echoed by several other senior officials, including William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, who testified last week that multiple senior administration officials had told him that the president blocked security aid to Ukraine and would not meet with Mr. Zelensky until he publicly pledged to investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s political rivals.\n\nWhile the White House has urged witnesses subpoenaed by Congress not to participate in the impeachment inquiry, failing to comply with a congressional subpoena would be a risky career move for an active-duty military officer.\n\nAs tensions grew over Ukraine policy, the White House appears to have frozen out Colonel Vindman. Since early August, he has been excluded from a number of relevant meetings and events, including a diplomatic trip to three countries under his purview: Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus.\n\nColonel Vindman said he had reported concerns up his chain of command because he believed he was obligated to do so.\n\n\u201cOn many occasions I have been told I should express my views and share my concerns with my chain of command and proper authorities,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that any good military officer should and would do the same, thus providing his or her best advice to leadership.\u201d", "description": "A White House national security official who is a decorated Iraq war veteran plans to tell investigators that he heard President Trump appeal to Ukraine\u2019s leader to investigate one of his leading political rivals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAJv7YO.img?h=373&w=624&m=6&q=60&o=t&l=f&x=496&y=503", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
