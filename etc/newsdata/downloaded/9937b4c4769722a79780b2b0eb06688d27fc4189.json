But as the bank\u2019s president Mario Draghi says, the currency union would be in much better shape if countries with strong fiscal positions opened their purses.\n\nFiscal doves will no doubt take heart from a slight softening of tone in Germany, the promise of some tax cuts and more investment in the Netherlands and the start of a debate in the European Union on how to improve its fiscal rules. But these changes are still too small to matter. If past experience is any guide, it may take a full-blown recession before the continent\u2019s political leaders act.\n\nAnnouncing the fresh round of QE last week, Draghi was unequivocal about what needed to happen next. \u201cIt\u2019s high time for fiscal policy to take charge,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cif fiscal policy had been in place, or would be put in place, the side effects of our monetary policy would be much less.\u201d The ECB\u2019s governing council agreed. The introductory statement to last week\u2019s report, which summarizes the consensus views around the table, said \u201cgovernments with fiscal space should act in an effective and timely manner.\u201d\n\nA superficial assessment might suggest that something is shifting among the richer members of the currency union. Last month Olaf Scholz, Germany\u2019s finance minister, hinted that Berlin could spend up to 50 billion euros ($55 billion) in a crisis, putting a number on a possible stimulus for the first time. The Dutch government unveiled an expansionary budget on Tuesday, including 350 million euros for affordable housing and a plan to set up a long-term investment fund. Last weekend in Helsinki, the EU\u2019s finance ministers looked at how to revamp the rules governing tax-and-spending decisions.\n\nThe euro zone economy is slowing because of the global trade wars and its knock-on effect on business confidence, so any fiscal moves are welcome. But a closer look at the detail suggests the announced changes will have a very limited effect. Scholz reminded everybody this month that Germany has no intention of abandoning its \u201cblack zero\u201d policy, a balanced budget rule introduced in the aftermath of the region\u2019s sovereign debt crisis. Any stimulus from Berlin would come after a recession \u2014 and not to prevent one.\n\nThe Dutch government, meanwhile, is still eyeing a small fiscal surplus for next year and any Netherlands investment fund would take shape over three decades. That\u2019s not great cause for excitement. As for the EU, the Helsinki meeting proved that there were still major differences about how to change the fiscal rules, meaning they won\u2019t be rewritten any time soon.\n\nSo the euro zone will have to rely on monetary policy for the foreseeable future. This is disturbing for two reasons. First, a well-designed, coordinated fiscal stimulus would almost certainly prove more effective than monetary policy, which is already stretched. Second, the ECB is increasingly split, with the central bank governors of large countries such as France, Germany and the Netherlands opposing Draghi\u2019s plan to reactivate net asset purchases. Christine Lagarde, who takes over as president in November, may find it politically difficult to keep pressing on the monetary accelerator.\n\nThe danger is that governments will only act decisively when it\u2019s too late. Draghi\u2019s last appeal looks set to go unheeded.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Ferdinando Giugliano at fgiugliano@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.net\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nFerdinando Giugliano writes columns on European economics for Bloomberg Opinion.
