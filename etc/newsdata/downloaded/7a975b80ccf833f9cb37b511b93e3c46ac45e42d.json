Kamala D. Harris on Wednesday defended her call to suspend President Trump\u2019s Twitter account, saying it\u2019s a matter of public safety.\n\n\u201cI think on this issue we all need to understand that if you talk with those families in El Paso, if you talk with the family of the whistleblowers, if you talk with the family members of people who have been at the receiving end of Donald Trump\u2019s threatening remarks on Twitter, you will know this is no laughing matter \u2014 it is a serious matter,\u201d the California Democrat said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it is a matter of the safety of those individuals,\u201d Ms. Harris said. \u201cYou can look at the fact that the shooter in El Paso was influenced by the words that the president of the United States, unfiltered, uses through this medium on Twitter.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has 65 million followers,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we have to take seriously the implications that are about threatening witnesses, intimidating witnesses and obstructing justice. And this is a private company that has rules of engagement, terms of use, and the president should be treated just like anyone else.\u201d\n\nMs. Harris had been asked about some of the online pushback she got for talking about the issue at Tuesday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate.\n\nAt the debate, she had called on Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to join her in saying Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter account should be shut down. Ms. Warren declined.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.", "description": "Sen. Kamala D.
