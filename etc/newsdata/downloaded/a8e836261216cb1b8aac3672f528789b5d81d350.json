An additional 337 people from around the world have been charged in relation to the Tor-based site.\n\nWelcome to Video contained over 200,000 videos of child sexual abuse and had users from countries like the U.S., UK, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Ireland, Spain, Brazil and Australia, according to the indictment, which was uploaded by NBC News reporter Cyrus Farivar. Users could download videos through a system of credits that could be gained by referring new users or by buying those credits with Bitcoin.\n\nCharges in the U.S. against the site\u2019s operator Jong Woo Son were only unveiled today, but the 23-year-old Korean national was arrested in March of 2018 and is already behind bars in South Korea. The operation was a joint investigation by numerous law enforcement agencies around the globe.\n\nBetween June 2015 and March 2018, Welcome to Video received Bitcoin transactions totalling over $547,200. Undercover agents in Washington D.C. monitored the site, filled with images of child rape, and were able to de-anonymise the Bitcoin transactions, something that average users often believe is impossible.\n\nThe investigation uncovered at least two former federal law enforcement officials allegedly involved in the child porn site, a 35-year-old U.S. Border Patrol Agent from Texas, and a former HSI special agent, also from Texas.\n\n\u201cDarknet sites that profit from the sexual exploitation of children are among the most vile and reprehensible forms of criminal behaviour,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division said in a statement published to the DOJ website.\n\n\u201cThis Administration will not allow child predators to use lawless online spaces as a shield. Today\u2019s announcement demonstrates that the Department of Justice remains firmly committed to working closely with our partners in South Korea and around the world to rescue child victims and bring to justice the perpetrators of these abhorrent crimes.\u201d", "description": "Federal authorities in the U.S. have unsealed charges against the South Korean operator of a child porn ring that\u2019s been billed as the world\u2019s \u201clargest dark web child porn marketplace.\u201d The child porn site, known as Welcome to Video, charged some users in Bitcoin and authorities say they successfully unmasked...", "authors": ["Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/sdtetfaaydg1zjw9fb48.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
