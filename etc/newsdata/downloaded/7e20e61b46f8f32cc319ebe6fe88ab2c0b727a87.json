Back then, when people watched scheduled broadcast TV, ending an episode with a shocking twist was a surefire way to make sure people would return at the exact same time the following week.\n\nIf producers got a cliffhanger right, they\u2019d have a sensation on their hands. When Dynasty ended its Royal Wedding episode with terrorists shooting up the place and leaving basically the entire cast bleeding on the floor, it knew people would return to find out who had been fatally injured. When a bearded Jack revealed that his flashback had actually been a flashforward all along, it gave Lost enough momentum to push through to the finish line. When JR was shot at the climax of the third season of Dallas, the result wasn\u2019t just the most-watched television episode in US history, but a mystery so perplexing that even the Queen Mother mobilised for spoilers.\n\nBut cliffhangers are a dying art, and we only have our viewing habits to blame. There\u2019s more television around than at any point in history, but we\u2019ve become a captive audience. Take Russian Doll, for example. One episode ends with an air-conditioning unit falling from the sky and crushing an unseen character to death. Had that show been made 20 years ago, the identity of the deceased would have dominated the cultural conversation for an entire week. But Russian Doll is a Netflix show from 2019, so instead we got a little box counting down from five and then, bingo, mystery resolved forever.\n\nOnce, shows would have gone out of their way to lure you back for the next episode, spending vast amounts of money on elaborate marketing campaigns and live reveal shows \u2013 as EastEnders did when Phil Mitchell was shot or Lucy Beale was killed \u2013 but Netflix was the first service to actively attempt to dissuade you from watching more episodes. After all, we\u2019ve all experienced the red-hot guilt and shame that comes with the \u2018Are you still watching this?\u2019 window.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest One episode ended with a nuclear bomb, and the only sensible way to react was to shrug ... 24.

I remember watching the first series of 24 in weekly chunks on TV, and its shameless twists and turns would fully obsess me between episodes. But when I watched later seasons on DVD, it became harder and harder to get invested in a cliffhanger, because there would only be a matter of seconds before we got to see the aftermath. One episode literally ended with a nuclear bomb going off, and the only sensible way to react to it was to shrug.\n\nStill, this isn\u2019t to say that the cliffhanger is well and truly dead. Under special circumstances, they can still enthral us like they used to. Bodyguard is the perfect example. Because you had a huge amount of people watching the same thing at the same time, parcelled out into weekly episodes, the death of Keeley Hawes\u2019 character became nothing less than a national talking point. When the Radio Times ran a cover in the ensuing days screaming \u2018WHY SHE HAD TO DIE\u2019, it escalated the conversation in a way that hasn\u2019t been seen for years.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest WHY SHE HAD TO DIE ... Bodyguard, a show that managed to enthral us all like TV used to.

Remove any possibility of resolution from your series and you\u2019ll guarantee it\u2019ll be talked about for decades. Sometimes this happens on purpose \u2013 it\u2019s the lack of a satisfying conclusion that makes the last episode of The Sopranos one of the best finales of all time \u2013 but sometimes it can be caused by situations beyond its control.\n\nAt least twice this year, Netflix has hacked off a TV show in its prime. Santa Clarita Diet will now always end on a note that could have sent a potential season four into dizzying new territory, but instead leaves the whole series dangling by a tantalising thread. And the newest season of The OA ended on such a legitimately batshit note that its premature cancellation just seems outright cruel. So perhaps it\u2019s wrong to say that Netflix has killed cliffhangers. Perhaps, by cancelling shows before anyone wants them to end, it has actually perfected them.", "description": "We used to agonise for weeks, months, even years over a sensational TV ending.
