She said: \u201cYou were two or three years old, and I caught and mostly stopped you.\u201d\n\nMy dad was studying engineering at Sunderland University and my mum was studying religions. He came from Zambia, she came from Cumbria. They were soon to complete their studies when I happened. I guess it was love. I\u2019d like to think I was a love child. Mum made very typically British food. Rhubarb crumble, shepherd\u2019s pie, jacket potatoes. Dad would cook traditional Zambian marinated meat dishes with nshima [cornmeal porridge], especially on Sundays, and they had salt, flavour, soul and everything I loved at the time. Except his mushrooms. I hated mushrooms.\n\nI remember Dad saying: \u201cIf it kills you, I\u2019ll know never to give it to you again.\u201d I would be more nervous making food for my dad because he doesn\u2019t hide his emotions. If he doesn\u2019t like it, he just won\u2019t finish. It\u2019s not rudeness, it\u2019s his honesty. And he\u2019s such a good cook.\n\nIn primary school I had a best friend called Alison and we had this game of who could stay the longest in the dining hall. We\u2019d wait to the very end of the third bell. I liked the chips and custard and the sponge pudding. We didn\u2019t have much money at first, but I was lucky and grateful I had free meals.\n\nBefore my \u201cprofessional\u201d albums, I made an EP at university. It\u2019s called Super-Duper Lover. I loved butterscotch-flavoured Angel Delight and there\u2019s a whole verse about how my partner at the time knew my favourite Angel Delight despite him hating it. It was my song to him. I married him but got divorced. He wasn\u2019t really a good cook. He liked to eat for energy. If he could take food in a pill, he\u2019d have it in a pill.\n\nAfter three years of studying medicine at Glasgow University I had the choice of doing an intercalated degree and picked neuroscience. It was mind-blowing. Consciousness is always on my mind. Eating for comfort or out of emotion is something I think I\u2019m beginning to understand; how you can seek to control things by eating too much or too little. There\u2019s so much psychology related to the things that pass through the mouth, like smoking, drinking, eating and talking too much.\n\nMy younger sister wasn\u2019t a big eater. She didn\u2019t like meat. At the end of a meal I\u2019d fall on her leftovers. She lives with me now and she\u2019s a brilliant cook, with Dad\u2019s talent for flavours, trusting the instinct, the gut, but she\u2019s vegan. It\u2019s my house, but she definitely \u201cowns\u201d the kitchen.\n\nWhen we were writing my second album, the sound for the track Hurts started because we\u2019d just finished eating and were drumming our spoons on the table. For the new album, the studio was right next to the kitchen in my house, so we\u2019d go back and forth, and it was good for bonding and a respite. My sister would make us vegan food or they\u2019d all go off to the shops and take turns at the cooker.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Emeli Sand\u00e9: Hurts\n\nUsually song ideas I\u2019ve devised for other people are just sent from London to LA, but Alicia Keys is a singer I\u2019ve spent real time with and she mentored me. Alicia introduced me to this great pizza place across from her studio. The first time I met her she was immediately very welcoming and encouraging \u2013 I have a very strong memory of us eating noodles on a balcony in New York.\n\nWhen I changed my mind about the way I thought and ate about food a few years ago, it was pretty revolutionary and I became vegetarian. I had a fish tank and I\u2019d called one fish Adele \u2013 my real name \u2013 but then it died. One minute there was a living creature; the next it was gone. Then I started having dreams about animals talking to me. I had one very profound dream in which a deer told me: \u201cWe\u2019re just the same thing. I am you and you are me.\u201d\n\nMy favourite things\n\nFood\n\nMarinated tofu in anything or everything. My sister \u2013 who\u2019s all about raw \u2013 tells me not to eat soya. \u201cIt\u2019s still processed.\u201d But for me it\u2019s a very good alternative protein.\n\nDrink\n\nI really like my champagne. The taste, how light it is. The first time I drank it must have been when I was becoming a pop star in London. It was only white wine before the Ivor Novellos.\n\nRestaurant\n\nMildred\u2019s in Soho, London \u2013 its fake chicken and cocktails are really good, and the salads are awesome. Often you go to veggie places and the taste isn\u2019t there, but Mildred\u2019s has really nailed it.\n\nEmeli Sand\u00e9\u2019s new album, Real Life, is out now on Virgin EMI.
