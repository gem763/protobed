Labour won\u2019t let Donald Trump get his hands on our National Health Service.\u201d\n\nAs long ago as January, America\u2019s pharmaceutical firms were asking the US government to ensure Brexit trade negotiations increased the price they can charge the NHS for drugs.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nAt a public hearing in Washington DC, Brian Toohey of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America moaned about price controls set by Britain. He went on to say the US-UK Brexit trade negotiations were \u201can important opportunity\u201d to force the UK to pay the higher drug prices US manufacturers are desperate to charge.\n\nHe demanded \u201cfull market access for US products\u201d and \u201ccompetitive market-derived pricing\u201d.\n\nWithout the price controls the NHS could be forced to pay hugely inflated American costs \u2013 which can be over 20 times more for some medication, costing the NHS billions.\n\nDr Andrew Hill of the University of Liverpool, an advisor to the World Health Organisation, said: \u201cOur annual drugs bill for the NHS is \u00a318 billion. If we had to have American drug prices we are talking about that going up to \u00a345billion \u2013 or \u00a3500million a week extra for the NHS to pay.\u201d When the PM went to the US in September he planned to tell business leaders Britain will roll out the red carpet for a trade deal, with tax breaks and fast-track public sector contracts.\n\nAnd in June, Trump told a press conference in the Foreign Office: \u201cI think everything with a trade deal is on the table. So NHS or anything else...everything will be on the table, absolutely.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson, Health Secretary Matt Hancock and International Trade Secretary Liz Truss have all insisted the NHS is \u201coff the table\u201d in talks with the US when UK leaves the European Union.\n\n(Image: Leon Neal)\n\nBut in the final Prime Minister\u2019s Questions clash before the General Election on December 12, Mr Corbyn told MPs yesterday: \u201cThis election is a once-in-a-generation chance to end privatisation in our NHS, give it the funding it needs. Our NHS is up for grabs by US corporations in a Trump trade deal. This Government is preparing to sell out our NHS. Our health service is in more danger than at any time in its glorious history.\u201d\n\nThe Commons session was the last PMQs attended by Ken Clarke, 79, before he prepares to retire as the longest-standing male MP in the House of Commons.\n\nMocking the PM over the claim on his Brexit campaign bus, Labour MP Jon Ashworth said last night: \u201cBoris Johnson famously promised to deliver \u00a3350million per week for the NHS but his sell-out deal with Donald Trump could hand over \u00a3500million per week more of NHS money to American corporations.\u201d\n\nYesderday Mr Corbyn visited Crawley Hospital in West Sussex to launch his campaign. Today he takes aim at what he describes as \u201ca corrupt system\u201d \u2013 the tax dodgers, bad bosses and big polluters holding the country back.\n\nHe says: \u201cThis election is a once-in-a-generation chance to transform our country, take on the vested interests holding people back and ensure that no community is left behind.\u201d\n\nHe promises \u201creal change is coming\u201d as \u201cwhen Labour wins, the nurse wins, the pensioner wins, the student wins, the office worker wins, the engineer wins. We all win\u201d.\n\nDoctor-turned-comic Adam Kay warned in the Mirror this week that throwing open the NHS to US drugs firms and health insurance giants would lead to sky-high post-Brexit treatment and prescription prices.\n\nThe NHS budget in England is \u00a3140billion a year. But the service overspent by \u00a34.3billion in 2017/18, and the 240 NHS trusts owed the Department of Health and Social Care \u00a37.4billion in historic loans.\n\nLabour says the Tories have imposed the longest spending squeeze in the NHS\u2019s history despite huge recent funding injections. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has pledged that Labour will \u201chave a real go\u201d at winning the election \u2013 insisting that despite the polls he was confident the party would end up in No10.\n\nMr Johnson has admitted to MPs he expects a \u201ctough\u201d general election battle.\n\nNigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party is considering whether to pull out of fighting hundreds of seats to avoid splitting the Leave vote. But by concentrating its efforts on Labour-held marginals which backed Brexit he could deprive the Tories of their target seats.", "description": "The Labour Party leader fears the health service could be thrown open to Big Pharma companies after Brexit", "authors": ["Pippa Crerar", "Image", "Peter Summers", "Getty Images", "Leon Neal"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20760996.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Labour-Leader-Speaks-To-Activists-In-Key-Marginal-Harrow-East.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
