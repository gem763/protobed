I had to try to lip-read. My hearing aid wouldn\u2019t even work.\n\n\u201cIt made me really angry. Over the last 10 years I\u2019ve just made an appointment, gone in and it\u2019s been done.\n\n\"Suddenly I was told there was a three-month waiting list.\u201d\n\nAt one point Mr Jones \u201cseriously considered\u201d suing the practice if he had had an accident as a result of his deafness.\n\nHe said government funding to his local practice in North Norfolk had been cut in the past five years, as patient numbers rose after new homes were built.\n\nMr Jones said his surgery had been left more than \u00a3400,000 short of the funding it needed.\n\n\u201cI know two ladies in their 80s who have had to pay \u00a380 to have their ears irrigated privately.\n\n\"I got an appointment after three months. I refused to pay \u2013 I believe strongly in the NHS.\u201d\n\nAfter Mr Jones complained, his surgery laid bare the pressure they were under.\n\nTheir astonishing response to him said: \u201cWe have to balance the staff we have, the hours they work, their skills, our available space and the overall demand for all services we offer.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate ear irrigation is very important for you, but the same applies in respect of anti-coagulation, phlebotomy, post-operative care, complex drug monitoring, taking and interpreting ECGs, tending to minor injuries, monitoring patients with eating disorders, PSA monitoring, diabetes and COPD care, supporting patients with mental health problems, dementia identification, cancer care, chronic kidney disease, epilepsy monitoring, fitting and removing contraceptive implants to name but a few \u2013 all in respect of many of our other patients.\u201d", "description": "Graham Jones, 76, needed ear irrigation to help with a hearing problem but was left stunned when he was told there was a waiting list", "authors": ["Alan Selby", "Image", "Internet Uknown"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20470057.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_gj_2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
