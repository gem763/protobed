Mike Lee of the Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Department, who addressed the shooting in a press conference.\n\nIn a review of the dash cam footage, Lee said that, at first, \u201cit looked to just be conversational \u2015 there was no combat, no arguing, just looked like a routine traffic stop that we conduct every day.\u201d\n\nHowever, as Dhaliwal walked back to his patrol car, the civilian \u2015 who has since been identified as 47-year-old Robert Solis \u2015 pulled out a gun within seconds, and \u201cran up from behind and basically ambushed\u201d him, shooting him in the back of the head, Lee said.\n\nTwo houses away from the scene, a woman doing yard work outside heard two shots fired, and spotted Solis fleeing the scene. She then checked on Dhaliwal and called 911, prompting officers from multiple precincts to begin searching for the gunman.\n\nPolice tracked Solis down at a business less than a quarter mile away from the scene.\n\n\u201cA deputy observed that he looked a little nervous and put him in custody,\u201d Lee said. \u201cAnd that did turn out to be our shooter.\u201d\n\nPolice have also taken a woman into custody who was a passenger in Solis\u2019 car.\n\nSolis has been charged with capital murder. There was also an active parole violation warrant out against him for aggravated assault, dating back to January 2017, according to Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez.\n\nDhaliwal\u2019s death has been deeply felt in his community where those who knew him have begun sharing tributes on social media. One Harris County resident who sent a video to the sheriff\u2019s office of Dhaliwal playing with her deaf son recalled that he \u201claughed and joked with all of us, and left a bright impression\u201d on the boy.\n\nThis video captures the essence of who Deputy Dhaliwal was. He touched countless of lives along the way. A legacy that will never be forgotten. We will aspire to be as good as he was. #HouNews #lesm https://t.co/c3i2eBBLMv \u2014 Ed Gonzalez (@SheriffEd_HCSO) September 28, 2019\n\nPoliticians have sent their condolences, including Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, a former congressman for the state.\n\n\u201cMy heart is with his family, with my friend Sheriff Ed Gonzalez, with his fellow officers in Harris County and across the country who are keeping our communities safe tonight,\u201d O\u2019Rourke tweeted.\n\nDeputy Sandeep Dhaliwal, who devoted his life to public service, was killed today in the line of duty. My heart is with his family, with my friend Sheriff Ed Gonzalez, with his fellow officers in Harris County and across the country who are keeping our communities safe tonight. https://t.co/eu6CRUKeKq \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 28, 2019\n\nOfficer Dhaliwal was the first Sikh in Texas to wear his turban while on duty. Earlier today, he was tragically shot and killed in the line of duty. My deepest condolences to his family, friends, and fellow officers. Rest In Peace, Sandeep. https://t.co/A8ko0mmMpT \u2014 Senator John Cornyn (@JohnCornyn) September 28, 2019\n\nDhaliwal joined the force 10 years ago and received widespread attention in 2015 when he became the first Texan to wear his articles of faith while on duty, after the sheriff\u2019s department adjusted its regulations. Though dress codes in law enforcement have been shifting to allow Sikhs the freedom of religious expression, change has been slow. (Within the military, accommodations remain rare.) For that reason, Dhaliwal was recognized for breaking new ground.\n\nSim Singh, senior manager of policy and advocacy at the Sikh Coalition, an anti-hate group advocating for civil liberties, praised Dhaliwal in a statement sent to HuffPost Saturday.\n\n\u201cOur hearts and prayers are with Lt. Dhaliwal\u2019s family in light of this tragic news,\u201d Singh said. \u201cHe embodied the Sikh value of service and was clearly a role model for the Houston community and a trailblazer for Sikh Americans. While there is no established motive for his murder at this time, we have every confidence that the Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office will conduct a thorough investigation and provide more information soon.\u201d\n\nThe Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund also spoke out about Dhaliwal\u2019s death, calling it shocking and saddening.\n\n\u201cHe was a pioneer for the Sikh community and will always be remembered,\u201d the organization tweeted. \u201cOur condolences and prayers go to his family and friends.\u201d", "description": "Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Department Deputy Sandeep Dhaliwal made history in 2015 for wearing his articles of faith while in uniform.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8f79d22100005b00fceadc.jpeg?cache=hclzyjbonp&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
