You did not do enough. To everybody else: rebel,\" XR said on its website ahead of its International Rebellion wave of activism.\n\n\"You can't count on us or Greta to do this for you,\" it said, referring to teenage Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. \"Look inside yourself and rebel.\"\n\nExtinction Rebellion was established last year in Britain by academics and has become one of the world's fastest-growing environmental movements.\n\nCampaigners want the government to declare a climate and ecological emergency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2025, halt biodiversity loss and be led by new \"citizens' assemblies on climate and ecological justice.", "description": "Hundreds of climate activists barricaded themselves into a Paris shopping centre on Saturday as security forces tried to remove them, ahead of a planned series of protests around the world by the Extinction Rebellion movement.
