The fixture has been designated as high risk, with the Czech police ready to deploy an unprecedented number of officers, including English-speaking \u201canti-conflict units\u201d and, if necessary, anti-riot units.\n\nThe England Supporters Travel Club will have 3,731 of its members in Prague while 3,130 will be in Sofia on Monday week for the game against Bulgaria. But it is expected that around 6,000 England fans will be in Prague \u2013 a city that is well-known for its cheap beer and nightlife. Never before would so many supporters have come to Prague at a single time.\n\nWhen England played the Netherlands in a friendly on a Friday night in Amsterdam during March 2018, there were more than 100 arrests and condemnation for the appalling behaviour of the travelling fans. The National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council said at the time that it had \u201csignificant\u201d concerns about playing the game on a Friday night but they had not been consulted. The FA said it has no say in the scheduling of Uefa tournament matches.\n\n\u201cI wrote to Uefa asking them to reconsider the Friday night kick-off,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThat\u2019s not something we\u2019ve been able to do. It is harder when you\u2019re dealing with them [Uefa] and, particularly, when you\u2019re playing away. I think it\u2019s unfortunate because you can foresee the risk. We\u2019d much rather prevent a situation developing than try to manage it on the night and regret it afterwards.\u201d\n\nThe police and FA have done much to tackle violent hooliganism but the issue these days relates more to antisocial behaviour or, as Roberts puts it, the \u201cstag-do mentality and the problem that we have with alcohol consumption\u201d. He describes how many of the offenders are younger men with no criminal records who, as such, are difficult to spot and police. They only reveal themselves as troublemakers when they drink to excess and, even then, sometimes do not think they have done much wrong.\n\nRoberts gives an example from June\u2019s Nations League finals in Portugal when England fans caused mayhem in Porto, drawing responses from baton-wielding officers. \u201cI saw one young Tottenham fan who was outside one of the bars,\u201d Robert said. \u201cHe was drunk and joining in with all the songs that we\u2019re familiar with. He was not throwing bottles but others were and the situation escalated. A couple of days later, I saw that lad and he\u2019d been out to buy his mum a little present. It was wrapped up in paper. Yet he\u2019d been a part of that group and if he\u2019d have got batoned, he\u2019d have been horrified. So would his mum. He\u2019s there with the stag-do mentality. They don\u2019t always realise the risks of what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nRoberts spells out the implications for the respectful England fans \u2013 all of them risk being tarred with the same brush and receiving harsh treatment. He makes the point about what happened before June\u2019s Nations League semi-final against the Netherlands in Guimar\u00e3es, when two turnstiles were not working, a crowd built up and there was a bit of pushing but nobody did anything wrong. Then, the riot police charged in with batons.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw was the Portuguese police probably reaching a threshold of their patience,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt\u2019s the decent England fans who picked up the tab for the people who had been drunk and abusive for a number of days. It\u2019s starting to influence the way they are policed.\u201d\n\nRoberts has encouraged the Czech police to take \u201clow-level action early doors\u201d against individual trouble-makers before large mobs build up while the FA has launched a campaign called \u201cReport that idiot\u201d.
