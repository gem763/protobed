Jay Inslee said, \u2018Let\u2019s get tough on this,\u2019\u201d said Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, as she laid out a new plan that she said had been influenced by her former rival. In addition to proposing $3 trillion in spending on environmental initiatives, Ms. Warren also responded \u201cYes!\u201d when asked by a moderator, Chris Cuomo, if she would support a carbon tax \u2014 a measure she had not spelled out in her official policy proposal.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has not explicitly taken up Mr. Inslee\u2019s ideas, said, \u201cWe are proposing the largest, most comprehensive program ever presented by any candidate in the history of the United States.\u201d Mr. Sanders has sought to win over the liberal wing of the Democratic Party with a plan that takes its name from the Green New Deal and has the biggest price tag of all the candidates\u2019 proposals \u2014 $16.3 trillion over 15 years.

While the United States is the world\u2019s largest historic polluter of greenhouse gases, it today produces about 15 percent of total global emissions, and experts have said it is impossible to solve climate change without international curbs on emissions.\n\nIn the Group of 7, \u201cI know almost every one of those world leaders,\u201d Mr. Biden said, adding, \u201cIf I was present today, I would be \u2014 there would be no empty chair,\u201d referring to a recent gathering at which Mr. Trump skipped a meeting on climate change.", "description": "At a CNN forum on climate change, the first such prime-time event in a presidential campaign, candidates vowed to take aggressive action to combat global warming.", "authors": ["Coral Davenport", "Trip Gabriel"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/03/us/03dems-climate/merlin_159211935_033dca2a-636d-4aed-955a-abe875c6501b-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
