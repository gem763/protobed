The BBC said the blockage affected everyone equally.\n\n\"It must be hugely frustrating for voters, but it\u2019s not proof of rigging,\" she added. \"The problem is celebs at the bottom of the leader board after the judges\u2019 scores will often get a surge of support from fans Celebrities at the top are safe, too. It\u2019s the dangerous middle zone where fans have to do the hard lifting. Dev and Dianne were 10th \u2014 they desperately needed votes.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: DIGITAL/EROTEME.CO.UK)\n\nThe judges had given Dev and Dianne a high score for their cha cha but the impact of the viewer vote sent the duo crashing into the bottom two by the end of the night.\n\nSusanna said Strictly was as much as popularity contest as a talent show which is why 'ungainly' acts of Mike Bushell and Chris Ramsey were still in.\n\nThe presenter said she agreed with calls for the BBC to publish the voting figures each week.\n\n\"That\u2019s one way to put the \u2018fix\u2019 rumours to bed,\" said Susanna.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nYesterday, Stricly professional Dianne Buswell called upon fans to stop trolling head judge Shirley Ballas.\n\nShe was alerted on Twitter that some trolls had been sending Shirley death threats over the decision to eliminate Dev from the competition.\n\nAll four judges unanimously voted to send him out in the dance off.\n\nShirley appeared on Loose Women to defend her decision earlier this week - and said viewers were partly responsible for his demise.\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\n'\"People have got to get out there and vote. We do our job. As you can see there were many people saved with lot lower scores.\n\n\"It's just so important. I respect everybody at home who\u2019s been watching fifteen series. Everyone has a favourite. We do our job to the best we can.\n\n\"We have to do it right there in that split second on the one minute 20 seconds. We have to make a decision.\n\n\"The three judges were unanimous. It wasn\u2019t down to me. It was unanimous and I agreed.\"", "description": "The Good Morning Britain presenter says she was dogged by fix rumours when she appeared on the show", "authors": ["Lucy Needham", "Image", "Pa", "Bbc Guy Levy", "Itv", "Digital Eroteme.Co.Uk", "Getty", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article11173197.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PROD-Strictly-Come-Dancing-Live-Tour-2014-Photocall.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
