USA TODAY\n\nIn a weird game filled with questionable officiating, injuries and an unexpectedly close margin, Jarrett Guarantano provided the most bizarre play of them all.\n\nAnd it was followed by an outburst by Tennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt.\n\nOn fourth-and-goal from the Alabama 1 in the fourth quarter, with the Crimson Tide leading 28-13, Guarantano's attempt at stretching the football over the pile on a quick sneak attempt resulted in the ball getting smacked away by Alabama linebacker Shane Lee. Trevon Diggs then returned the ball more than 100 yards for a Crimson Tide touchdown, ending any idea of a Vols comeback and upset.\n\n100-yard scoop 'n score for Alabama \ud83d\ude33 pic.twitter.com/o7fZE6GeYC \u2014 ESPN (@espn) October 20, 2019\n\nPruitt's frustration boiled over by the time Guarantano made it back to the sidelines, where the coach was seen tugging on the junior quarterback's facemask as he hotly discussed the play.\n\nDon\u2019t think coach is happy pic.twitter.com/9e5XEbJr35 \u2014 Busted Coverage (@bustedcoverage) October 20, 2019\n\nWas it a planned sneak? ESPN announcers considered that it was a planned conventional run, given that offensive linemen were pulling. That could be the reason why Pruitt was so irate. And it wasn't the first time that Pruitt had been emotional on the sidelines in his two seasons as the Vols head coach.\n\nMore: Alabama QB Tua Tagovailoa knocked out of game vs. Tennessee with ankle injury\n\nWinners and losers: Week 8 in college football led by Wisconsin, Oregon\n\nWeek 8 observations: Wisconsin exposed as fraud in title chase and that could hurt Big Ten\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve run two quarterback sneaks earlier in the game by pushing the pile,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cWe could either go back with it or run a sneak, and we elected to run a sneak and he shouldn\u2019t have jumped over the top,\" Pruitt said postgame.\n\n\u201cHe should have pushed it there over the middle.\"\n\nEither way, the Vols' final chance at clawing back against the No. 1 team in the country was popped up into the air and returned for a touchdown. Pruitt was energetic throughout Saturday's game, and the fumble by Guarantano pushed him close to the edge.\n\nI know you\u2019re mad Jeremy Pruitt, but don\u2019t do that. pic.twitter.com/knG3297Mar \u2014 Bryan Fischer (@BryanDFischer) October 20, 2019\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "description": "Tennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt was seen yanking Jarrett Guarantano's facemask following the quarterback's crucial fumble against Alabama.", "authors": ["Nick Gray", "Published A.M.
