After four stints on the injured list caused by his balky right knee this year, he craved one last October in the limelight, moving to the bullpen.\n\nBut his body gave out, a metaphor for the entire team against the Astros so far.\n\nHitting, pitching and fielding all went poof!\n\nNew York had not made four errors in a postseason game since 1976 and never before in the Bronx. Some of the fans who remained in a mostly empty Yankee Stadium applauded sarcastically when shortstop Didi Gregorius caught an infield popup in the ninth.\n\nDuring the regular season, the Yankees led the major leagues with a .294 batting average with runners in scoring position. In the ALCS, they haven\u2019t scored on a hit other than a home run since the opener.\n\nNew York was 0 for 7 with runners in scoring position, dropping to 4 for 27 in the four games - including 1 for 16 in the three straight losses. The Yankees stranded 10 runners, increasing their series total to 33. They struck out 13 times, giving them 43 in the series.\n\nThis game started to turn in the first inning, when S\u00e1nchez fanned on a slider from the erratic Greinke as New York failed to build on its 1-0 lead following Brett Gardner\u2019s bases-loaded walk. With the Yankees trailing 3-1 in the fifth and the bases full again, Torres struck out on a checked swing on a slider low and away from Pressly, and Encarnaci\u00f3n swung over a fastball, ending the inning.\n\nWin by the homer, lose by the homer.\n\nNew York\u2019s 306 long balls during the regular season were second to Minnesota\u2019s big league record of 307. The Yankees led the majors with 943 runs, and were fourth in percentage of runs scored on homers at 51.1, trailing only Toronto (53.2), Milwaukee (51.5) and Minnesota (51.2).\n\nManager Aaron Boone repeatedly maintained he was unconcerned about the power reliance. New York has plated eight of its 13 runs against the Astros on five homers, two-run drives by Judge and S\u00e1nchez, a pair of solo shots by Torres and bases-empty pokes by Giancarlo Stanton and Gio Urshela.\n\nAfter thriving despite 30 players going on the injured list, the aches have become too onerous, players struggling in their return from late-season injuries.\n\nEncarnaci\u00f3n is 1 for 15 with eight strikeouts, S\u00e1nchez 2 for 17 with eight strikeouts, Urshela 2 for 15 and Aaron Hicks 1 for 6 with three strikeouts.\n\nAfter the best offensive performance of his career during the season, Gardner is 2 for 15 with seven strikeouts.\n\nNow time is short.\n\nJames Paxton takes the mound Friday after getting just seven outs in Game 2. The Yankees\u2019 103 regular-season wins, their most in a decade, may not amount to much.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "CC Sabathia threw a cutter to George Springer and grimaced, then covered his face with his glove as he walked to the dugout after what was likely the final pitch of his career.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ronald Blum"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/18/alcs_astros_yankees_baseball_86182_c0-155-3705-2316_s1200x700.jpg?4867d5ae39576192df57b04ded2343291067f547", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
