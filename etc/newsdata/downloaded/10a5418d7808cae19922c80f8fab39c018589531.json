Republican lawmakers and aides \u2014 who chose the city for their three-day gathering before Trump decried it as \u201cthe Worst in the USA\u201d \u2014 weren\u2019t sure the president would want to attend.\n\nTrump\u2019s attendance could elate GOP lawmakers still licking their wounds from last fall\u2019s midterm shellacking by the Democrats, who took the House majority. But it could also spark protests from residents and local leaders who are still simmering over Trump\u2019s attacks on their city and don\u2019t want him there.\n\nTrump\u2019s offensive on Baltimore started in late July, when he took to Twitter to accuse Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), the House Oversight Committee chairman, of being a \u201cbrutal bully.\u201d Cummings\u2019s panel has unearthed deficiencies in the administration, including shortfalls in the security-clearance process at the White House and concerns about Trump\u2019s decision to give his son-in-law Jared Kushner access to the nation\u2019s top secrets.\n\nCummings has also been investigating whether Trump has tried to enrich himself while in office by steering business to his hotels.\n\nBut Trump didn\u2019t limit his attacks to the Baltimore congressman; he decried the entire area Cummings represents \u2014 a predominantly black constituency \u2014 as being \u201cdangerous & filthy\u201d and a place \u201cno human being would want to live.\u201d\n\nCity officials pushed back on Trump\u2019s comments forcefully. Cummings, a vocal critic of Trump\u2019s, invited him to visit to dispel his assumptions about the city.\n\nNow, Trump will \u2014 albeit not with Cummings.", "description": "The president will speak to House Republicans at their three-day retreat this week.", "authors": ["Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/IQRm3MUmt8ceiCZ0qDF1n7ivz1I=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XP4M5WVZHEI6TM5UFO3J5DCOHE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
