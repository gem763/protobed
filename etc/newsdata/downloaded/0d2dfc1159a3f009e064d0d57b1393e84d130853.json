By tomorrow night they should be able to take a decision.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Rain going sideways\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cThe decision is not for us, necessarily, because for us it\u2019s nice and easy, cosy, in the garage.\n\n\u201cBut for the people out there around the track it is not nice to be sitting there with rain going sideways.\u201d\n\nA blank Saturday would be a huge disappointment to thousands of fanatical supporters at one of the best attended races on the circuit, but other drivers were prepared for the worst.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got my speedboat on standby, so I\u2019m ready,\u201d joked Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen.\n\n\u201cAt the moment it doesn\u2019t look very likely. So we\u2019ll have a bit more free time on Saturday and it means waking up a little bit earlier on Sunday,\u201d he added.\n\nWith the storm expected to move away rapidly, qualifying could take place early on Sunday morning, something that happened in Japan in 2004 and 2010, with the race as scheduled in the afternoon. But Saturday\u2019s third free practice session would be lost.\n\nFerrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc said he hoped the FIA would consult the drivers to decide if conditions were safe but thought it \u201cwould be pretty clear if we can\u2019t drive\u201d.\n\nFrench driver Jules Bianchi crashed in the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix after a typhoon. He died of his injuries the following year.\n\nThe typhoon has also already affected the Rugby World Cup in Japan, with Saturday\u2019s England-France and New Zealand-Italy final pool matches cancelled.\n\nTwo minor support races scheduled for Saturday at Suzuka have already been scrapped as a precaution.", "description": "Suzuka (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Japanese Grand Prix organisers will not make any decision to postpone Saturday qualifying for another 24 hours but pledged", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/0680e0_mercedes-british-driver-lewis-hamilton-crosses-finish-line-win-2018-japanese-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
