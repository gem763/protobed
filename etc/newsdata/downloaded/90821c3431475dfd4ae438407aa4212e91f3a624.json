Morocco\u2019s claims to the territory are largely unrecognised internationally: Western Sahara remains on the UN\u2019s decolonisation list of non-self-governing territories.\n\nSaleh, a human rights advocate who lives in a Sahrawi refugee camp in Algeria, spoke on human rights and decolonisation at the University of Sydney\u2019s Peace and Conflict Studies Centre on 5 September, and was scheduled to speak at the law school on the \u201clegal, political and human aspects\u201d of the Western Sahara situation on 25 September.\n\nKamal Fadel, the Australian and New Zealand representative for Polisario \u2013 the liberation movement for Western Sahara \u2013 said Saleh\u2019s speech had been planned for months when it was unilaterally cancelled by the university less than a fortnight before it was due to be hosted and without explanation or informing the organisers.\n\n\u201cWe had friends ringing up saying the event had been cancelled, I thought it was a joke. We had been dealing with the university for months, planning this event, but then they would not explain why the event had been cancelled. We were astonished and very disappointed.\u201d\n\nFadel said even if the event was cancelled for the reasons claimed by the university, the fact it was cancelled after Morocco had written to the law school about Saleh\u2019s appearance gave rise to the impression that universities were susceptible to foreign influence.\n\n\u201cIf a small country like Morocco, very far away, feels it can do these things, it sets a very dangerous precedent for other stronger powers. We hope this was not the case, but the fact that they [the Moroccan embassy] did send a letter, and the event was cancelled without any discussion creates a perception.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to have foreign influence on a great, independent university like the University of Sydney.\u201d\n\nIn an email sent 12 September explaining the cancellation, the university said hosting two events featuring Saleh could create \u201can unfortunate perception that the university as a whole takes a particular position on relevant issues\u201d. The email said the university regretted the cancellation and its preference would have been to hold a single event in conjunction with the Peace and Conflict Studies centre.\n\nThe University of Sydney has strongly defended its independence, saying the speech was cancelled solely for the reason that a second event appeared to be a duplication, or too similar, to justify being hosted at the same university.\n\n\u201cThe event was not cancelled due to any external pressure.\n\n\u201cAfter discovering our department of Peace and Conflict Studies was hosting the same main speaker on campus just two-and-a-half weeks earlier, our Sydney Centre for International Law decided to cancel their event given the similarity in content,\u201d a spokeswoman for the university said.\n\n\u201cIf they had been made aware of the double-up earlier, the centre would have proposed a single jointly hosted event instead.\u201d\n\nThe University of Sydney Law School confirmed it had received a letter from the Moroccan embassy \u201cexpressing concern about some of the wording in the event description on our website and hope the information presented at the event would be balanced\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe did not receive any requests to cancel the event.\u201d\n\nThe spokeswoman said the university was \u201cdeeply committed to the expression and protection of free speech and academic freedom: this includes tolerance of a wide range of views, even when the views expressed might be controversial\u201d.\n\nAustralian universities to work with security agencies to combat foreign interference Read more\n\nFadel said he did not accept the university\u2019s position that the events were too similar.\n\n\u201cThe speakers were different, the theme was different, the location was different. The Western Sahara issue is large and complex, and is able to be handled by different faculties at different times. This event was to discuss the legal aspects of the situation, which were not addressed last time in discussions about human rights issues.\u201d\n\nThe issue of foreign influence \u2013 real or perceived \u2013 on Australian universities is of acute sensitivity currently, most particularly around foreign governments sponsoring research or institutes.\n\nAdvertised on the University of Sydney\u2019s website and sponsored by its Centre for International Law, the Saleh event was sold out before it was cancelled, according to the Eventbrite page.\n\nGuardian Australia has contacted the Moroccan embassy for comment.\n\nOther academics and trade unions have written to the University of Sydney expressing their concern over the cancellation of Saleh\u2019s speech. The event has been moved for the same time and date to the University of Technology Sydney.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Human rights advocates warn of \u2018dangerous precedent\u2019 as sold-out event featuring Tecber Ahmed Saleh cancelled after Moroccan embassy expresses concern", "authors": ["Ben Doherty"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cec17cfd58a4a47eb2e5fc3515a9e85a5573ab9b/69_75_747_448/master/747.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4b750a4b8e4ee7c338eef3716ab4cf2a", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
