Five of the six attacks took place in and around Colombo, the capital. A total of seven suicide bombers died in the attacks, while another blew himself up later, after his explosives failed in a fourth Colombo hotel.\n\nThe committee also said an open spat between the president, Maithripala Sirisena, and the prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and the ensuing political crisis contributed to the security failures.\n\nThe report said that Sirisena failed on \u201cnumerous occasions to give leadership and also actively undermined government and systems including having ad hoc national security council meetings and leaving out key individuals from meetings\u201d.\n\nSirisena and Wickremesinghe are from different parties and formed a cohabitation government in 2015. They fell out and their spat broke into the open in October 2018 when Sirisena dismissed Wickremesinghe as prime minister. A court decision that restored Wickremesinghe as prime minister ended a 52-day government standstill. But from that point on Sirisena did not involve Wickremesinghe in security council meetings.\n\nThe report said the intelligence service did not report to the military on possible attacks until 19 April. The next day Jayawardena called the national police chief to say there was a high probability that an attack would occur on 21 April.\n\nOn Easter morning Jayawardena called the police chief again to say that \u201csomething dangerous would happen on that day\u201d, the report said. He also called the secretary to the defence ministry, Hemasiri Fernando.\n\nFernando was quoted in the report as saying that \u201cwithin a few minutes\u201d of speaking to Jayawardena, \u201cI heard that there had been a bomb explosion at one of the hotels.\u201d\n\nThe committee recommended reforms in the security and intelligence sectors, improved monitoring of financial transactions, and the monitoring and controlling of religious extremism.", "description": "Parliamentary report says Nilantha Jayawardena had information on attacks 17 days before they happened", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dd937a985200c00de615eb99fb7fc04dd6ab341/0_110_3303_1982/master/3303.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5029a0c62269933d0d410bb7696257e6", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
