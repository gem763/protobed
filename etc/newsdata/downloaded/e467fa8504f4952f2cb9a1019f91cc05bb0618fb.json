Which designer is making Made in Bangladesh a label to be proud of, and who the are the rising stars of Italian tailoring? We have the answers for autumn/winter\n\nMade in Bangladesh\n\nRahemur Rahman\u2019s chat is rapid. He has a lot of ideas and talks quickly to cram them all in. Hailed as a breakout star from London fashion week men\u2019s, his naturally dyed, organic fabrics, and the jackets and trousers he tailors them into, are winning the 28-year-old fans from the UK to LA.\n\nRahman\u2019s road hasn\u2019t always run smoothly. At school, he felt like a misfit: \u201cThey all came from a Bangladeshi community and I grew up in Millwall [where his parents settled when they came from Bangladesh in the 80s], which was predominantly white.\u201d\n\nHe found his way to Central Saint Martins via a youth arts organisation, and at first his work \u201crarely touched on my culture\u201d, inspired instead by \u201cthe London scene I grew up in \u2013 grime music, the contrast between rich and poor in Canary Wharf, the history of Brick Lane and tailoring\u201d. But when Rana Plaza happened, Rahman had \u201can awakening\u201d and became set on creating designs that spoke to the craft and heritage of his parents\u2019 homeland. Inspiration comes from the mishmash that is his dad\u2019s personal style, with a colour palette taken from old family photographs.\n\nLast year, he took his first ever trip to Dhaka \u2013 \u201cI was like, mind blown,\u201d he says. He now markets his brand as made in Bangladesh: \u201cThe textiles are made there and I\u2019m made there, too.\u201d EVB\n\nThe big easy\n\nSerena Bute\u2019s louche clothes may be airport style goals, but people will, she hopes, \u201cdo more than travel in them. Go to lunch, to yoga, dress them up for dinner.\u201d Versatility and ease are key to an eponymous collection that can be worn by Bute, by her kids, her mother and, of course, by you. EVB\n\nPatchworks at Coach\n\nSometimes the finest ideas are staring you in the face \u2013 something certainly true of Coach creative director Stuart Vevers\u2019 AW19 stimuli. He was inspired to work with legendary textile designer Kaffe Fassett when he plucked one of Fassett\u2019s books from his shelf. \u201cThe best collaborations are the ones that are personal, with great creatives who bring something different to the table,\u201d enthuses Vevers, who incorporated Fassett\u2019s colour-pop prints and patchworked blooms into leather donkey coats, dipped-hem dresses and Lurex sweaters. With both men influenced by the American west coast, the juxtaposition of homespun and haute results in a textural feast.

If that doesn\u2019t mean much to you, suffice to say he\u2019s this year\u2019s most hyped man in fashion. The 32-year-old Brit, a former Phoebe Philo protege at Celine, started the year by teasing an ad campaign that saw Philo worshippers immediately herald him as the natural successor to her understated minimalism. For autumn, however, he confounded expectations with a collection that combined men\u2019s and womenswear, and added far more rock\u2019n\u2019roll swagger than the upscale normcore look Philo fans would have expected. Tailored pencil dresses, motorbike trousers and belted, oversized coats came in leather of all finishes \u2013 from a cushioned version of the label\u2019s signature Intrecciato weave to an open loop design similar to chainmail. The shoes and the bags were instant hits.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t felt like this in years!\u201d said influencer and shoe enthusiast Sandra Hagelstam on her Instagram account as she posted a picture of five box-fresh pairs of slip-on square-toe heels. The outerwear items will no doubt be hit items when temperatures drop. With waiting lists already amassed for much of this inaugural collection, let the Lee effect commence.

The new collection features relaxed suiting, workwear-inspired shackets and a good line in wide-leg trousers, peppered with paisley prints and a pastel palette. \u201cInclusive and effortlessly modern is the best way to describe it,\u201d Sandor says.

It is important to founder Caroline Smithson that as much work by hand as possible goes into the brand\u2019s clothes \u2013 but that it doesn\u2019t come across \u201ctoo make-your-own-yoghurt\u201d.\n\nShunning the seasonal model, Ss\u014dne instead hopes to develop a kind of uniform. The aesthetic is utilitarian with moments of romance \u2013 Smithson is inspired by 70s feminists \u201cwho were super-glamorous, but wearing overalls and picketing\u201d. And designers may well use their leftovers on their clothes: one jumper has been naturally dyed using everything from foraged nettles to avocado stones from the team\u2019s lunches. It looks good enough to eat. EVB\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A look by Ss\u014dne for autumn/winter 2019.

Lagos-based Ize (pronounced e-zay) has been honing his craft since he started his eponymous menswear brand in 2015 after studying at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna under Bernhard Willhelm and Hussein Chalayan. Championing Nigerian craftsmanship, Ize uses local weavers to make the fabric for his multicoloured suiting, hoping to redefine luxury and shine a light on the country.\n\n\u201cThere is an increased awareness of the nuances of Nigerian fashion,\u201d says Ize, who caught the eye of this year\u2019s Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) prize judges. \u201cYounger designers are finding ways of reinterpreting this heritage and increasing its exposure, and I am very excited to be part of it.\u201d SC\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Model Selene Naomie wears matching top and bottoms by Keith Ize.

Let us add one more: brave. In the last year, the Nigerian-born, Surrey-raised designer left Central Saint Martins mid-MA to get to the frontline of fashion her own way, designing clothes for Skepta to wear in a video and kitting out the likes of the Nigerian football team after gaining notoriety with her BA collection.\n\nThe Mowalola brand celebrates what the designer has called \u201cfluid masculinity\u201d, with hand-painted leathers her MO. No wonder Kennedy nabbed her for Fashion East\u2019s AW19 show \u2013 Ogunlesi\u2019s catwalk debut. \u201cHer singular vision comes from her heart,\u201d Kennedy says. \u201cShe\u2019s the punk queen and inspiration we all need.\u201d SC\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A model wearing Mowalola\u2019s autumn/winter collection on the catwalk at the Fashion East show during London fashion week.

Deveaux New York. Not to be confused with the world\u2019s oldest leather goods brand Delvaux, the label, founded by Matthew Breen and Andrea Tsao in 2016, brought street-style photographer Tommy Ton on board as creative director in 2018. Ton\u2019s photography was a major instigator of the fashion industry\u2019s current obsession with street style, so who better to consult on what the brand calls \u201cstreet style reimagined\u201d?\n\nThe result \u2013 a mix of cashmere crew-neck jumpers, double placket shirts and tailored \u201carchitect trousers\u201d \u2013 pricked the interest of matchesfashion.com which is stocking the brand for AW19. \u201cThe team have told me how they always consider the \u2018real life\u2019 factor \u2013 they wear the samples to see if they work on the morning commute and they\u2019ll wash pieces, walk their dogs in them and so on,\u201d says Damien Paul, head of menswear. \u201cThis allows them to develop a fairly minimal aesthetic but create best-in-class product.\u201d SC\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shirt, \u00a3417, waistcoat, \u00a31,028, and trousers, \u00a3575, by Deveaux New York.

This season sees Gou branch out and launch her clothing label Kirin, named after the Japanese word for her favourite animal, the giraffe. All head-to-toe prints, athleisure accents and jolty colour palettes, it was launched at Paris fashion week in February and smacks of the energy she emits from the DJ box \u2013 as well as what she herself wears for those gigs.\n\n\u201cPeggy\u2019s own style embodies the mood and direction our customer is interested in right now,\u201d says Sebastian Manes, buying and merchandising director at Selfridges, where Kirin is stocked for AW19. Like Gou\u2019s career up till now, the brand is set to go stratospheric. This is partly thanks to a deal with New Guards Group, the conglomerate that launched Virgil Abloh\u2019s Off-White, among others. Kirin came into being after the New Guards founders approached Gou at \u2013 where else? \u2013 a gig. It\u2019s this connection to the party scene that Manes says makes Kirin more than a celebrity label. \u201c[She] is uniquely placed to bring together club culture and high fashion through design [as well as] a global perspective and network.\u201d SC\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jumper, \u00a3558, trousers, \u00a3432, and scarf, \u00a3311, by Kirin, from luisaviaroma.com.

A new generation are finding their power by revisiting traditional craftsmanship and adopting a more conscious approach.\n\nIn Milan, Sunnei designers Loris Messina and Simone Rizzo use their brand to bring together creative communities (its last menswear show was staged in an urban regeneration project it funded on the outskirts of Milan), working with artists, musicians and charities on its critically acclaimed collections. Further south, Giuliva Heritage Collection, run by husband and wife Margherita Cardelli and Gerardo Cavaliere, champions the lost art of traditional Italian tailoring, designed from Rome, where they will open their first shop next month. \u201cSpecial talents need to be nurtured as they define a nation,\u201d Cardelli says. \u201cIt\u2019s our duty to keep alive this great Italian talent.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile the collective Legres, launching on matchesfashion.com this month, is using Italian craftsmen and women to create its \u201cminimalist nonconformist\u201d footwear.\n\nThe common thread with this Italian new wave? Authenticity. \u201cBeing totally transparent is something truly inspirational,\u201d Cardelli says.\u201cOur approach to life reflects what we do.\u201d SC\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Designs from the Giuleva Heritage collection, a label based in Rome Photograph: Giuleva Heritage Collection\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
