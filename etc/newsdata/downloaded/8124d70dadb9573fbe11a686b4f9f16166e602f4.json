He spent 17 years playing for some of Europe\u2019s biggest clubs, redefining the nature of his position. And this July he captained Brazil to glory at the Copa Am\u00e9rica, his country\u2019s first major silverware in over a decade. So, what does he still have left to prove? The answer, it seems, is quite a lot.\n\nAlves has returned to live in his homeland for the first time since he left Bahia as a teenager in 2002. Many Brazilian stars come back to enjoy a few years of comfort before hanging up their boots, but he quickly lays that notion to rest. \u201cI adore challenges,\u201d says Alves with a smile. \u201cI love it when nobody believes that things will happen and you go there and do it. That\u2019s my passion. That lights the flame inside me.\u201d\n\nFor now, two challenges are keeping that flame alight: his desire to restore S\u00e3o Paulo to their former glories and, ultimately, his ambition to win the World Cup in 2022. Alves will be 39 by the time the tournament begins, but he is deadly serious about making it to Qatar. \u201cIt\u2019s my dream,\u201d he says.\n\nAlves was born in Juazeiro, 2,000km north of Brazil\u2019s biggest city, but S\u00e3o Paulo are part of the reason he fell in love with football. \u201cI\u2019ve been a S\u00e3o Paulo fan since I was a child,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked being a champion and S\u00e3o Paulo were champions, champions, champions. My dad had a team called S\u00e3o Paulo too, an amateur team. He\u2019d put the lads from the farms together to play.\u201d When playing for that team, Alves would imitate Cafu, who helped S\u00e3o Paulo win back-to-back Libertadores and Intercontinental Cup titles in 1992 and 1993. \u201cMy childhood hero was my dad and second, Cafu, because of the position he played, because of his story. I like the story more than just the way of playing. Cafu\u2019s story of persistence is fucking amazing. It gave me great hope.\u201d\n\nHe was picked up by big local club Bahia as a boy, before being whisked off to Sevilla at the age of 19. \u201cIt was very quick,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI played one and a half championships for Bahia and went. That was the most difficult period of my career. I came from playing every game to not even being on the bench. It was a big shock. However, I learned early that it is during hard times that you really learn who people are, whether they take a step forward or backwards. I always found a way of getting results rather than looking for excuses. I started to do more to understand what the coach wanted. I wanted to find out what I needed to do to live up to expectations. And I ended up having a marvellous time at Sevilla. Together with my teammates, we changed the history of Sevilla.\u201d\n\nJuninho: 'I should not have left English football when I did' Read more\n\nAll these years later, winning that first Uefa Cup final against Middlesbrough in 2006 remains his favourite achievement. \u201cThe best moment of my career was when I won the first title with Sevilla,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was with a team that, when I arrived, was battling against relegation. Being part of that reconstruction is an ecstasy of emotions. You see everyone crying, people happy in the city. A story started to be written there. Being part of that is sensational.\u201d\n\nHis success with Sevilla helped him secure a move to Barcelona. \u201cFrom there, I got to the most desirable place in world football, not just because of the players they have, but because of the identity, the quality of their game, the value they add to football. They really fight for the word \u2018football\u2019. It was a school, it is a school and it will continue being a school of football concepts. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. I had offers from other big clubs, but they didn\u2019t offer me the chance of building something new. Barcelona was in that transition. After Ronaldinho, they dropped off a bit and wanted to get back to being what they were. I\u2019d already made history as part of the reconstruction of a club, so I wanted to do that again.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dani Alves and Neymar at Barcelona. Photograph: Manu Fernandez/AP\n\nHe sees his mission with S\u00e3o Paulo in the same light. The club have not won the league since 2008 and have not laid their hands on any silverware since 2012. Taking them back to that level is his passion project. \u201cI\u2019ve come to S\u00e3o Paulo to tell the story of a fan who has come to play for the club he supports. And who is going to fight for this club more than any other fan. I\u2019m doing something no other fan can. I\u2019m there, on the pitch supporting and playing at the same time. I\u2019m playing for the club I dreamed of playing for. S\u00e3o Paulo is the only club I would play for, knock on wood, if they went down to the second division.\u201d\n\nWhen Alves was unveiled by the club in August, he was given a hero\u2019s welcome, received by 45,000 people in the Morumbi stadium and handed the No 10 shirt by Kak\u00e1. He has mostly been playing a free role in the centre of midfield. \u201cI\u2019m a full-back who plays a combination game. But here \u2013 because of the characteristics of Brazilian football, the way the team plays and, a lot of times, the teammates \u2013 you don\u2019t have so many [short-passing] combinations. If I play in the position I did for 20 years, I can\u2019t interfere as much in the game.\n\n\u201cWhen I get involved, I help my teammates to become better. It\u2019s been like that my whole career \u2013 at Bahia, Sevilla, Barcelona, Juventus and PSG. Those clubs have a history of having done that for a while. Here, the coach changes all the time and you\u2019re always trying to adapt to the coach you have. In my position in the middle I\u2019m better for my teammates. I\u2019ll be sincere, I created a new way of playing as a full-back. No false modesty. I am always adapting to my teammates. If they\u2019re wide, I\u2019ll go into the middle. If they\u2019re attacking, I\u2019ll help with the control. If the ball\u2019s on the other side, I tuck in. I play as a creative midfielder from the back.\n\n\u201cBarcelona gave me this understanding. When I played with Xavi or Rakitic, there was always a player controlling the game. If I was wide, Xavi or Rakitic were behind me. Seeing them play, I thought: \u2018When you have a winger who stays wide, you need to stay in the area of control.\u2019 At S\u00e3o Paulo, my challenge is to be able to understand my teammates and to combine with them as well as possible.\u201d\n\nPep Guardiola, he says, was vital in developing his positional game. \u201cThis understanding is one of the greatest qualities for players who can manage it. There are a lot of people who want the ball, want the ball, want the ball. Sometimes they could cause more harm without it. That\u2019s what I did at Barcelona. When Pep taught me how to play without the ball at Barcelona, that season I got something like 18 assists.\u201d\n\nHas Guardiola dome something similar with Raheem Sterling at Manchester City? \u201cThe same thing. Obviously, you have to have players to execute it. If the executors are not so good, the quality is not so high. The most interesting thing is that Pep always manages to find quality. That\u2019s why players always stand out with him.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dani Alves in action for PSG. Photograph: Franck Fife/AFP/Getty\n\nAlves does not limit himself to improving his team on the pitch. He wants to help his club and Brazilian football as a whole. \u201cThe clubs must try to create a collective playing identity. Brazilian football needs to reinvent itself in this regard. For individual quality, I\u2019ve never seen a country like it. Every year, there are innumerable quality players. But you see a lot of individuality. There aren\u2019t clubs that are brilliant for a long time because of their collective play.\n\n\u201cIf you have a clear idea, you are less likely to change the manager every year. There are clubs that have two or three coaches in a year. It\u2019s madness. You never create stability. There needs to be better planning. You have to make important choices and really back them. That\u2019s what generates stability inside a club and a team. We should mirror European clubs, who create an identity. It\u2019s rare to see a big European club that one year is fighting for the title and the next is fighting to avoid relegation. Because the clubs are stable. S\u00e3o Paulo has a great identity as a club that really cares about its academy, but they don\u2019t take care on a collective level. I want to bring in a bit of the experience I had abroad of how you can make a club better.\u201d\n\nInside the Gr\u00eamio academy, home of Brazil's brightest young footballers Read more\n\nHe is not the only one. In the last few months, Filipe Lu\u00eds, Rafinha, Ramires and Luiz Adriano have returned to Brazil. \u201cIt tells you that Brazilian football is evolving,\u201d says Alves. \u201cClubs are bringing in players who\u2019ve constructed great careers and would still attract interest from Europe. Some of them are my friends and they know they can bring a lot to Brazilian football and help the younger players in their lives. Here in Brazil, you have to be mentally stronger than in any other place because of all the demands. Everything turns into a meme, a joke or taking the mick.\u201d\n\nAlves sees himself as a positive role model for young players. \u201cYou need examples to act as a mirror. There are lots of examples here in Brazil that, let\u2019s say, are fogged-up mirrors. They need more professional examples of how to respect the profession, respect football and its rules, respect their career as a high-level profession. That\u2019s a bit of the idea behind us coming back to Brazil.\u201d\n\nAs well as the opportunity to be part of a rebuilding project, Alves was attracted by S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s offer of a contract that runs until December 2022. The European clubs chasing his signature only offered 12-month deals. \u201cI wanted the stability to be able to fight for my dream, which is playing the 2022 World Cup. The other clubs didn\u2019t believe in my potential. They think I don\u2019t have anything to offer any more. I\u2019m going to show that, if you\u2019re willing to pay the price, you can do what you want.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest S\u00e3o Paulo fans turned out in big numbers to welcome Alves home in August. Photograph: Nelson Almeida/AFP/Getty\n\nHas Brazilian society changed since he left? \u201cI see some improvements and the continuation of some erroneous things. Corruption and violence exist everywhere, but are greater here because of the size of the country, the size of the population, the poverty. We are a bit of a selfish country. People don\u2019t worry about others enough. It\u2019s always \u2018me\u2019, never \u2018us\u2019. But nobody lives like Brazil. We are a people that, despite the difficulties, enjoy the world more than any other. People should focus on the incredible things the country has. From the moment you start thinking about the human being, rather than what they do and what they can offer you, things start to become more caring.\u201d\n\nThe issue of prejudice has come up recently in football, something Alves experienced first-hand at Villarreal in 2014. A banana was thrown at him from the stands, which he picked up and ate. Asked about how best to confront the problem of racism, he does not seem too hopeful. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to end. The less importance you give it, the better you will live. Giving it less importance is not acceptance. You can\u2019t accept that people humiliate you. When I did that [ate the banana], they created a campaign. I said: \u2018Sorry, I don\u2019t want to be involved in campaigns that won\u2019t achieve anything.\u2019 The awareness raised is momentary. People will forget afterwards.\u201d\n\nNeither does he believe that punishing clubs is the way forward. \u201cHow are you going to punish a club for the actions of one person, 10 people, 50 people? It wouldn\u2019t be fair. It would be fair if you catch the perpetrator and punish them. In football, like in any other area, there is no space for racists. You have to identify the culprit and punish them. The rest are not at fault.\u201d\n\nAlves hopes his energy will influence those around him positively, but do people under-appreciate him because of his gregariousness? \u201cIf they do, that\u2019s their problem. What matters is what I give people. I want people to have fun, to smile. Sometimes, people are too bitter. My objective is always to give my best to people. I might be crazy, but I\u2019m a good kind of crazy. I want everybody to be happy.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dani Alves celebrates with his Copa Am\u00e9rica player of the tournament award. Photograph: Andr\u00e9 Penner/AP\n\nBy now he has kicked off his football boots and is leaning back in his seat, giving long, meandering answers on any subject that crops up. \u201cI have a lot of theories,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe if your life follows a straight line, you have a dead life. Life has to oscillate and you have to try to make the ups greater than the downs.\u201d\n\nOn the topic of ups and downs, Alves was voted player of the tournament as Brazil won the Copa Am\u00e9rica on home soil, yet it was a strange tournament marred by low attendances, poor pitches and ill-tempered crowds. Did that negativity affect the dressing room? \u201cNo. The Venezuela game [a 0-0 draw after which they were booed] was better than some of the games we lost, but people don\u2019t want to know because the result was a draw. Your effort makes no difference; you have to get the results. We started to think: \u2018What is the final objective?\u2019 To win the Copa Am\u00e9rica. We have to go through phases. We\u2019re not going to stroll through, smoking a cigar and drinking champagne. No, my friend. No. You have to ralar a bunda no ch\u00e3o [scrape your bum on the floor].\n\n\u201cThat redoubled my confidence in my team. I knew nothing would shake us. The team knew what it was doing. That\u2019s what matters. If you beat Venezuela and lose the semi-final to Argentina, you\u2019re fucked. We said: \u2018Be calm. The result didn\u2019t come. Breathe deep and on to the next one.\u2019 That\u2019s the maturity of a great side.\u201d\n\nBrazil break free from the Neymar imbalance to win Copa Am\u00e9rica | Jonathan Wilson Read more\n\nAfter the title was won, many in Brazil suggested the team had performed better because of Neymar\u2019s absence. Alves will not even entertain this theory. He scoffs and, unusually, is temporarily lost for words. \u201cThose people don\u2019t know anything about football,\u201d he says once his initial disgust has passed. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible, impossible, impossible, impossible that the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o will be better without a special guy like Ney.\u201d\n\nNow, Alves\u2019 eyes are fixed firmly on the biggest trophy of all. \u201cI\u2019m going after that dream to be champion, to close an era with the Brazilian national team, to help my country get back on top. You know what motivates me most? When everybody stops believing in me. When they say: \u2018This guy is worthless, this guy can\u2019t play in midfield, can\u2019t do this or that.\u2019 Just wait. On the way there I\u2019m going to work like a filho da puta, like I\u2019ve done all my life. That\u2019s why I came here. I was comfortable in Europe, but I like discomfort. Nothing in life is easy. If you want to reach you objectives, you have to make the effort. Unless your dad owns the team \u2013 when my dad ran our S\u00e3o Paulo, I always played and played up front.\u201d\n\nDespite his jovial exterior, it is this drive that has carried him from his dad\u2019s S\u00e3o Paulo team to the real thing. A few days ago, he says, \u201c[S\u00e3o Paulo director Diego] Lugano came and asked me: \u2018How is it that this little body, these skinny legs, have won more titles than any other in the history of football?\u2019 My reply is that it\u2019s not my body, it\u2019s my soul. My body might look fragile, but it\u2019s here and here,\u201d he points to his head and bangs his right palm over his heart.\n\n\u201cSuccess is giving your best. Achievement is depriving yourself of things to get to where great young people aim to be. You have to say: \u2018I\u2019m here, focused. I\u2019ll put my blinkers on and nothing will put me off.\u2019 Sometimes in life you have be deaf, dumb and blind and let your soul carry you to get closer to your objectives. If you win without sacrifice, without effort, you will triumph with no glory at all.\u201d\n\n\u2022 This is an article from Yellow & Green Football\n\n\u2022 Follow them on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter\n\n\u2022 And follow Joshua Law and Tom Sanderson on Twitter", "description": "Alves reflects on 17 years in Europe, what he learned from Pep Guardiola, his experiences of racism and why he\u2019s back in Brazil", "authors": ["Joshua Law", "Tom Sanderson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fff9acf5cf4b5f0b0ca7876965fad26b3aeb2523/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d220965d0bbf843c55a1a25000a89df3", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
