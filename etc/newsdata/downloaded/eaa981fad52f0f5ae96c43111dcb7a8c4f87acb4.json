A GOP Senate could stymie them.", "language": "en", "text": "THE TICKER\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) speaks during a Tuesday rally in Austin. (Nick Wagner/Austin American-Statesman via AP)\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) will take the debate stage in Houston tonight with the political world focused on her ascendant candidacy \u2014 and Wall Street increasingly nervous about what it could mean for the industry\u2019s bottom line.\n\nBut as the financial sector begins to weigh its potential tab from a Warren presidency, a more practical question is arising: Does the candidate known for her plans have a plan to advance them through a GOP Senate if she makes it into the White House?\n\nAssuming Senate Republicans hold onto their majority in the 2020 elections, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has already proved capable of turning his chamber into a graveyard for progressive legislation. What\u2019s more, he could make it exceedingly difficult for Warren to fill key administration posts and thereby advance her agenda through rulemaking. Executive nominations, under current Senate rules, can be approved with 50 votes.\n\nWarren\u2019s agenda is both regulatory and legislative. Her plans to institute a wealth tax and remake corporate boards to reflect worker and community input, for example, would both need to pass Congress \u2014 an unlikely outcome even if Democrats claw out a Senate majority.\n\nHer proposals to, in her words, \u201creverse the Trump-era weakening of rules on capital, liquidity, leverage, and resolution-planning for big banks\u201d could advance without lawmakers\u2019 approval \u2014 though that proposition would get dicier if McConnell moves to deny floor voters to her nominees. In that case, Warren could appoint those denied confirmation to serve in an acting capacity, a gambit President Trump has used widely, but it could put decisions those officials make on tenuous legal footing.\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. But the candidate gave some insight into how she\u2019d approach getting her nominees confirmed in a GOP-controlled Senate in the first Democratic presidential debate. \u201cShort of a Democratic majority in the Senate, you better understand the fight still goes on,\u201d she said in June. \u201cIt starts in the White House, and it means that everybody we energize in 2020 stays on the front lines come January 2021. We have to push from the outside, have leadership from the inside, and make this Congress reflect the will of the people.\u201d\n\nWarren earlier this month in Hampton Falls, N.H. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola)\n\nThat is, Warren couldn\u2019t rely on procedural maneuvers to fight fire with fire. And in the absence of that option, she\u2019d seek to marshal her voters to pressure Senate Republicans.\n\nThe circumstances were inverted, but Warren already has demonstrated her ability to sway a presidential appointment by creating a grassroots groundswell: Back in 2015, she led liberals on a successful charge to sink then-President Obama\u2019s choice of Wall Street banker Antonio Weiss for the No. 3 post at the Treasury Department.\n\nAnd she has made a mantra of the Reagan team\u2019s maxim that \u201cpersonnel is policy.\u201d\n\nPersonnel is policy. Hiring Mnuchin & all these @GoldmanSachs execs shows @realDonaldTrump has no interest in reducing Wall St\u2019s influence. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 13, 2017\n\nAnd as a student of the federal bureaucracy and the power of seemingly obscure jobs in it to shape high-stakes policy, she doubtlessly has strong views about the profiles she would nominate for the administration\u2019s Senate-confirmable positions.\n\n\u201cHow do you get that personnel in there?\u201d Compass Point\u2019s Isaac Boltansky asks. \u201cI\u2019m of the view that we would see the cabinet-level folks through confirmation. Everything else would move at a snail\u2019s pace, and I don\u2019t know of any procedural mechanism for her to change that\u2026 It\u2019s going to be tough to get assistant secretaries confirmed.\u201d\n\nBoltansky said he seen a noticeable uptick in questions from Wall Street clients anxious about what a Warren administration would bring.\n\nThis for example is from Seawolf Capital cofounder Porter Collins:\n\nI\u2019m now convinced nobody is pricing in an Elizabeth Warren victory. Not a political statement. \u2014 Porter Collins (@Seawolfcap) September 10, 2019\n\nWarren tweeted this Tuesday in response to a CNBC segment about industry executives growing nervous about her candidacy:\n\nI'm Elizabeth Warren and I approve this message. https://t.co/2Ewkbm0ZwA \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 10, 2019\n\nPointing to the challenge she would likely face from divided government, Boltansky said he can \u201cmake a coherent argument why the financial services industry\u2019s greatest nightmares won\u2019t be turned into policy reality\u2026 I do believe it.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Capital Alpha president Charles Gabriel says, \u201cFocusing on the difficulty of moving her agenda is something that is going to be helpful in getting people not to commit seppuku as she continues to ascend.\u201d\n\nYou are reading The Finance 202, our must-read tipsheet on where Wall Street meets Washington.

(Sarah Silbiger/Reuters)\n\n\u2014 Trump says Fed should cut to zero or below: \u201c[Trump] escalated his attacks on the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, demanding that it slash interest rates to zero \u2018or less\u2019 so that the federal government can refinance the public debt that has ballooned during his administration,\u201d my colleagues David J. Lynch and Taylor Telford report.\n\n\u201cThe president has repeatedly complained that the European Central Bank\u2019s use of negative interest rates to spur growth tilts global markets against U.S. companies. But the comments marked his first call for the Fed to embrace similar emergency steps and were at odds with his customary boasts about the strength of the U.S. economy \u2026 The last time the Fed cut rates to zero was during the Great Recession, and it has never adopted negative rates, even during the 1930s when one-quarter of the labor force was idle. Despite Trump\u2019s impatience with the central bank, there is little sign that current interest rates are hindering the economy.\u201d\n\nHere was Trump on Wednesday calling Fed officials \"boneheads\":\n\n....The USA should always be paying the the lowest rate. No Inflation! It is only the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn\u2019t allow us to do what other countries are already doing. A once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of \u201cBoneheads.\u201d \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2019\n\nSuch a move could backfire, CNN Business's Matt Egan writes: \"There is a growing chorus warning that the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank's subzero regimes have backfired. Critics and some new academic research argue these unorthodox policies are crushing banks, keeping a lid on inflation and failing to juice growth. Worse, they harm savers and retirees hoping to earn safe returns in bonds.\"\n\nThe NYT's Jeanna Smialek explores other practical and political hurdles here.\n\n\u2014 Draghi's big decision day. Bloomberg's Yuko Takeo and Piotr Skolimowski: \"Mario Draghi is embroiled in one of the most contentious policy meetings of his European Central Bank presidency as he prepares to ramp up monetary stimulus again despite skepticism from the euro area\u2019s biggest economies. The mood is expected to be tense on Thursday when the 25-member Governing Council discusses how to respond to fading growth and inflation, according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.

(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\n\u2014 Trump rules out going around Congress on capital gains: \"[Trump] told his advisers on Wednesday that he doesn\u2019t plan to try to bypass Congress and lower capital-gains taxes by indexing gains to inflation, according to three people familiar with the matter,\u201d the Wall Street Journal's Andrew Restuccia and Kate Davidson report.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump delivered the message during an afternoon White House meeting on the capital-gains proposal. The idea has been under discussion in the White House for months and has divided Mr. Trump\u2019s aides, with some warning privately that it could cost him politically ahead of the 2020 election, the people said.\u201d\n\n\u2026 And moves to ban flavored e-cigarettes: \u201cTrump administration officials, alarmed by new data showing a huge jump in vaping by young people, said they are moving to ban most flavored e-cigarettes, a major development that could result in sweeping changes in the sprawling market,\u201d my colleague Laurie McGinley reports.\n\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s move comes as health officials across the country investigate more than 450 cases, including six deaths, of lung disease linked to vaping. Many patients have reported using cannabis-related products, but authorities have not ruled out any specific type of vaping. With the picture still murky, critics have seized the moment to press for tougher regulation of conventional e-cigarettes, which come in sweet and fruity flavors that have been favored by many young people.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Treasury admits error on oligarch list. But how it happened is crazy: \u201cThe U.S. Treasury Department issued a letter Wednesday stating that Valentin P. Gapontsev, an 80-year-old laser physicist who became a U.S. citizen a decade ago, does not belong on a list of Russian oligarchs that Treasury admitted in court to having cribbed entirely from a 2017 Forbes Magazine article,\u201d my colleague Steven Mufson reports.\n\n\u201cGapontsev, who has built a $6.8 billion company called IPG Photonics based in Oxford, Mass., was No. 27 on the list of 96 Russians that Treasury gave Congress when lawmakers were eager to retaliate for Russian interference in U.S. elections. Gapontsev has said that he never belonged on the list and that he had feared that Congress might use the list as a tool for applying pressure on the Kremlin. He said that unlike the Russian oligarchs, he built his company over three decades based on its advanced laser technology, not Kremlin connections.\n\nWhite House Presses Biofuel, Oil Executives for Compromise Trump administration officials are squeezing biofuel and oil refining executives to agree to a plan to bolster corn-based ethanol and soy-based biodiesel.

Its two dozen lobbyists include former Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.) and former Democratic and Republican congressional staffers of both parties. The company\u2019s PAC has also written nearly $200,000 in checks to candidates and PACs affiliated with both parties, according to campaign finance disclosures.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Purdue Pharma reaches deal in opioid suits: \u201cPurdue Pharma, manufacturer of blockbuster painkiller OxyContin, reached a tentative settlement Wednesday with 23 states and more than 2,000 cities and counties that sued the company over its role in the opioid crisis, according to attorneys involved in the deal,\u201d my colleagues Lenny Bernstein, Aaron C. Davis, Joel Achenbach and Scott Higham report.\n\n\u201cThe executive committee of lawyers representing cities, counties and other groups in a federal lawsuit against Purdue and other drug companies is recommending the deal be accepted. But more than half the state attorneys general in the U.S. balked, saying they planned to continue pursuing the company and its owners, the Sackler family.\u201d\n\nThe terms: \u201c... The Sacklers would relinquish control of Stamford, Conn.-based Purdue Pharma and admit no wrongdoing. The company would declare bankruptcy and be resurrected as a trust whose main purpose would be producing medications to combat the opioid epidemic. If the deal becomes final, it would be the first comprehensive settlement in the broad effort to hold drug companies accountable for their role in the opioid epidemic.\u201d\n\nT. Boone Pickens.
