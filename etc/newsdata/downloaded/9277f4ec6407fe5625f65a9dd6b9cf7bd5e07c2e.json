The government is using familiar tools, such as mass arrests and torture, as well as new tactics centered on high-tech surveillance and restricting social media to silence dissent and free speech, according to victims, activists and security experts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEgyptian security forces have arrested more than 4,300 people across the country since small but extremely rare protests erupted Sept. 20, according to the independent Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms . While the government previously focused on targeting political opponents, the latest efforts have swept up anyone deemed a threat, including more than 100 foreigners, journalists and even children.\n\n\u201cIf you compare it to the past, this is unprecedented, not just by the size but by the nature of it,\u201d said Mohamed Lotfy, ECRF\u2019s executive director.\n\nThe government has orchestrated sophisticated cyberattacks on cellphones of activists and journalists, enabling officials to read emails and files, track locations, identify people contacted, and in some instances, arrest them, according to a recent report by Check Point Software Technologies. The San Francisco area-based cybersecurity firm found the attacks were linked to Egypt\u2019s communications ministry and intelligence services.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, in downtown Cairo and in the northern city of Alexandria, plainclothes security agents and informants have set up informal checkpoints, randomly stopping people, demanding to see their cellphones and examining their social media accounts.\n\n\u201cThe checkpoints are a very brutal and naked form of monitoring people\u2019s behaviors,\u201d said Hussein Baoumi, Egypt researcher for Amnesty International. \u201cEveryone stopped is accused of being an enemy of the state or being a terrorist until proven innocent.\u201d\n\nThere has been no public criticism of the abuses by the United States, which provides $1.3 billion annually in military aid to Egypt, or any other foreign government. The U.S. State Department issued a statement supporting the rights of Egyptians to freely voice their political views. President Trump has remained a staunch supporter of Sissi, widely viewed as the most authoritarian leader in Egypt\u2019s modern history.\n\nThe Egyptian government did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement late last month, Egypt\u2019s prosecutor general said it had interrogated no more than 1,000 people and claimed that many of them were \u201cdeluded\u201d by fake social media posts and forces plotting against Egypt. The government has previously denied allegations of unlawful killings, forced disappearances, torture and other abuses.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n'Who is your contact in the CIA?'\n\nBoehm and a British friend, both students at the University of Edinburgh on a study abroad program to learn Arabic, were walking in downtown Cairo on Sept. 27 when the plainclothes police officer stopped them. The friend was quickly let go. But Boehm, kept blindfolded for 15 hours, was interrogated at a security facility for hours, mostly in English.\n\n\u201cWho is your contact in the CIA?\u201d one asked, recalled Boehm, speaking in a telephone interview.\n\nThey accused of him of sharing \u201cintelligence\u201d with a foreign state. They threatened to arrest his Egyptian friends and warned that he would never see his family again unless he confessed to being a spy.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey said they would never let me leave,\u201d Boehm recalled. \u201cAnd they said, \u2018Do you know what we do to Egyptians here? Do you want that to happen to you?\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nAfter his blindfold was removed, Boehm said he saw sticks with blood on them outside his cell and heard screams coming from other parts of the prison. Later, a Jordanian man was placed in the cell. He revealed bruises and said he had been beaten and electrocuted.\n\n\u201cYou never knew if they were going to torture you or not,\u201d Boehm recalled. \u201cIt was a constant state of high stress and tension.\u201d\n\nBoehm was not physically tortured, but the guards played \u201cmind games\u201d with him, he said.\n\nOn Sept. 29, Boehm was allowed to speak on the phone with a U.S. Embassy officer for the first time. Boehm was then taken to another prison with about 30 young men from Yemen, Sudan and other countries, who had been rounded up in downtown Cairo and beaten by police, he said.\n\nAD\n\nThe next day, Boehm was taken to the airport. He was handed back his phone \u2014 and placed on a plane to London, via Dubai, where his parents were waiting.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI am extremely lucky,\u201d he said.\n\nA U.S. Embassy spokesperson in Cairo, when asked about Boehm, said in an emailed statement that the embassy was aware of his case and had \u201cprovided appropriate consular services.\u201d\n\n'Spreading false news'\n\nAs Egypt\u2019s top military general, Sissi engineered a coup in 2013 that ousted the country\u2019s first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi. A year later, Sissi took office and began jailing tens of thousands of opponents and critics. Extrajudicial killings and torture grew. Hundreds of websites deemed critical of the regime were blocked.\n\nAD\n\nThe latest wave of repression came after videos were posted online last month by a whistleblower in self-imposed exile in Spain. Mohamed Ali, a former government contractor and part-time actor, accused Sissi and his generals of stealing taxpayer funds to build palaces and villas.\n\nSissi publicly denied the corruption allegations. But Ali\u2019s videos struck a chord with millions of Egyptians frustrated by rising prices, lowered subsidies and other economic woes at a time when Sissi has spent billions of dollars on large infrastructure projects.\n\nAli urged Egyptians to stage protests on Sept. 20, demanding Sissi\u2019s removal, and several hundred people did in small but rare demonstrations in several cities. When Ali called for a larger protest on Sept. 27, security forces deployed to suppress it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSocial media, which helped fuel the 2011 Arab Spring revolution against longtime President Hosni Mubarak, has become a target of the official crackdown. Hundreds of people have been arrested, including some tourists, for criticizing the government on Facebook or Twitter on charges of publishing \u201cfake news\u201d and defaming the country\u2019s image.\n\n\u201cThere is a deep belief within the security apparatus that information put out there on social media is more dangerous for the regime and more of a threat to its security and stability than terrorism,\u201d Lotfy said.\n\nSince Sept. 20, security forces have arrested at least 11 journalists and at least 25 politicians and academics, many on terrorism charges and for \u201cspreading false news,\u201d according to human rights groups.\n\nAD\n\nAt least 111 children, between 11 and 17, are among the arrested, according to Belady for Rights and Freedoms, a local human rights group dealing with children. Amnesty International said three children were buying school stationery and uniforms in downtown Cairo when they were arrested. Nearly two-thirds of the children are facing charges of being a member of a terrorism group or \u201cmisusing social media,\u201d even though many did not own cellphones, activists said.\n\n\u201cThey are redefining the interpretation of terrorist to include anyone who opposes the state or President Sissi himself,\u201d said Baoumi, of Amnesty International.\n\nAt least seven foreigners have been arrested and forced to \u201cconfess\u201d on a pro-Sissi television channel that they were part of a foreign conspiracy to undermine the president.\n\nAD\n\nAnd former prisoners are also being rearrested. Prominent blogger and activist Alaa Abd El Fattah was seized and tortured by security agents in prison, even though he was not involved in the protests and was already being watched by police, his family said.\n\n\u201cHe was blindfolded as he was brought to prison, forced to strip off all his clothes but his underwear, beaten up and verbally abused as he walked through a corridor into the prison,\u201d said Mona Seif, the sister of Abd El Fattah, in a Facebook post.\n\nSecurity forces also detained Esraa Abdel Fattah, a writer and key figure in the 2011 revolution. Her lawyer said she was beaten, slapped in the face and suffocated with her own sweatshirt to force her to open up her cellphone and social media accounts.", "description": "An American student was among thousands swept up in the Sissi government\u2019s campaign.", "authors": ["Sudarsan Raghavan", "Cairo Bureau Chief Covering North Africa"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1OOG55WeR9Xd4mUVSTp_GDkpQtM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GKCTHSX3IUI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
