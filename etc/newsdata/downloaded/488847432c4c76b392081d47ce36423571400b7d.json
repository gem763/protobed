Kurdish soldiers have helped the United States fight the Islamic State militant group, but the Turkish military has branded them terrorists.\n\n\u201cThis decision poses a dire threat to regional security and stability, and sends a dangerous message to Iran and Russia, as well as our allies, that the United States is no longer a trusted partner,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said in a statement calling on Trump to \u201creverse this dangerous decision.\u201d\n\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement: \u201cA precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime. And it would increase the risk that ISIS and other terrorist groups regroup.\u201d McConnell was referring to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nMcConnell also noted in his statement that most of the Senate voted in January for an amendment expressing bipartisan concern about the continuing threat posed by Islamic militant groups in Syria and support for a continued military presence.\n\n\u201cThe conditions that produced that bipartisan vote still exist today,\u201d he said.\n\nThe United States on Monday began pulling troops back from northeastern Syria\u2019s border, effectively giving Turkey a green light to move into the area, after Trump\u2019s surprise announcement on Sunday that he was withdrawing U.S. forces.\n\nMany Congress members from both parties quickly condemned the move, a departure from the deep partisan divide that has opened at the U.S. Capitol, worsened by House Democrats\u2019 decision to open an impeachment investigation of the Republican president.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi holds a news conference about Democratic legislative priorities and impeachment inquiry plans at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., October 2, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nOn Monday, several Republicans better known for their strong backing of Trump also expressed outrage over the decision. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham called the situation \u201ca disaster in the making\u201d that showed the United States is an unreliable ally.\n\nGraham said he would introduce a Senate resolution opposing the plan and asking for a reversal. He also said he and Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen planned to introduce bipartisan sanctions against Turkey if it invades Syria and will call for their suspension from NATO if they attack Kurdish forces.\n\nLater on Monday, however, Trump threatened to destroy Turkey\u2019s economy if it took its planned military strike too far.", "description": "In a rare show of bipartisanship, the top lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate on Monday condemned President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northeastern Syria, which could open the way for a Turkish strike on Kurdish-led fighters in the area.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438166504&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF961EX", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
