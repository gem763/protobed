(Reuters) - Sporting a Confederate flag shirt near a field clouded by cannon smoke, where blue- and gray-clad soldiers reenacted a Civil War battle from 155 years ago, Larry Caldwell Piercy, Jr. said he sees a new war looming in the United States - and a role for himself in any fighting.\n\nActors portraying Union and Confederate soldiers reenact the U.S. Civil War Battle of Cedar Creek in Middletown, Virginia, U.S. October 19, 2019. Picture taken October 19, 2019. REUTERS/Julia Harte\n\n\u201cIt would be all guerrilla warfare, not this open field-style kind of thing,\u201d he said, gesturing at the reenactment of the 1864 Battle of Cedar Creek in Middletown, Virginia, earlier this month. \u201cI would probably be an officer in that effort.\u201d\n\nPiercy, 62, is one of the motorcycle riders known as the \u201cmechanized cavalry\u201d of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, which has an estimated 30,000 members and describes itself as a \u201cnon-political heritage organization\u201d that preserves the history and legacy of soldiers in the pro-slavery Confederacy in the 1861-1865 Civil War.\n\nHe is also a fierce supporter of President Donald Trump.\n\nAs Democrats push to impeach Trump and controversy rages over whether to remove monuments to Confederate generals like Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, Piercy warned a new civil war is brewing.\n\n\u201cYou look into rural areas, and we\u2019re not seen, but there\u2019s a lot of us that\u2019ll come out of these hills if it keeps getting worse. Probably every Sons of Confederate Veterans member out there.\u201d\n\nThe Sons of Confederate Veterans, which limits membership to men with Civil War veteran ancestors, is not seeking to secede from the nation or to revive slavery, both Southern causes in the 1861-1865 Civil War. But they say they are trying to preserve the honour of the Confederacy by celebrating its flag, monuments, and other symbols that are widely criticized as tributes to institutional racism.\n\n\u201c#CivilWar2\u201d trended on Twitter in September after Trump quoted a pastor in a Twitter post saying it would \u201ccause a Civil War like fracture\u201d in the United States if he were removed from office.\n\nThe next day, the right-wing Oath Keepers militia affirmed Trump\u2019s tweet in its own Twitter post: \u201cThis is the truth. This is where we are. We ARE on the verge of a HOT civil war. Like in 1859.\u201d\n\nMary McCord, who led the Justice Department\u2019s national security division from 2016 until May 2017, noted the response from the Oath Keepers and other pro-Trump armed groups, and said members of the U.S. militia movement have shown they are ready to take action based on the president\u2019s comments.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPOLITICAL VIOLENCE\n\nWhile there is no evidence that radical groups on the right or left are organising a military campaign to plunge the country into civil war, a number of attacks in recent years have raised concerns about a surge in political violence.\n\nA woman was killed when a white nationalist plowed his car into a crowd of counter-protesters at a rally of right-wing extremists in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.\n\nIn August, a suspected white nationalist shot dead 22 people at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, shortly after posting an anti-Hispanic manifesto online.\n\nViolent rhetoric about an impending civil war is on the rise, said J.J. MacNab, a fellow specializing in anti-government extremism at George Washington University\u2019s Program on Extremism. \u201cIt used to be just the militia guys saying this stuff, and now it\u2019s gone totally mainstream,\u201d she said.\n\nShe pointed to a YouTube video posted in June that drew 1.4 million views. The video detailed how the electrical grid in \u201cmajor leftist cities\u201d could be taken down, and concluded that another civil war was inevitable and would be won by the right wing.\n\nGeorgetown University\u2019s Institute of Politics and Public Service this month released a poll that found a majority of Americans think political, racial, and class divisions are worsening, and that the average voter believes the United States is two-thirds of the way to the edge of a civil war.\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters at the Cedar Creek reenactment said Democratic opposition to the president had inflamed old rifts in U.S. society and pushed some to extreme positions.\n\n\u201cYou got some Sons of Confederate Veterans members that would start shooting tomorrow,\u201d said Jake Jennette, 79, a reenactor portraying General Lee.\n\nHe and his friend Wayne Newnam, who represented Lee\u2019s lieutenant general Jubal Early, said they used to be part of the group but left because they didn\u2019t like the violent turn that some members had taken.\n\nDave Clarke, who manned a table distributing Sons of Confederate Veterans literature and merchandise at the reenactment, said violent white supremacists had misappropriated the Confederate flag, and that he had faith in the U.S. system of government to resolve differences peacefully.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably people here who\u2019ve got AK-47s in their trunks but that\u2019s not the answer. We\u2019ve been there and done that. That\u2019s not the way,\u201d Jennette said, tears coming to his eyes as he recalled his own military service in Vietnam and his son\u2019s tour in Afghanistan.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nHe too supports Trump and believes the best way to avoid a war would be the \u201ctotal annihilation of the liberals\u201d at the ballot box when Trump seeks a second four-year term in the 2020 election.\n\nNewnam, 70, said he thought the United States had healed from the Civil War by the 1920s but is \u201cregressing\u201d to a state of polarization. He mainly blamed liberal resistance to Trump for the divide, but acknowledged that some of Trump\u2019s tweets have not helped.\n\n\u201cThe resentment was already there, and it\u2019s easy to drum it up again,\u201d said Newnam. \u201cSocial media has allowed people to be nasty to other people without having to face them. Maybe the Trumpster has brought that out a little. God knows some mornings I wish he\u2019d sleep a little later,\u201d he added, chuckling.", "description": "Sporting a Confederate flag shirt near a field clouded by cannon smoke, where blue- and gray-clad soldiers reenacted a Civil War battle from 155 years ago, Larry Caldwell Piercy, Jr. said he sees a new war looming in the United States - and a role for himself in any fighting.", "authors": ["Julia Harte", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446143035&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0P5", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
