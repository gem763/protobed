We'd just cancelled a few of the day trips and stayed on our terrace.\n\n\"When the cabin crew asked us about it, I turned on our light because I thought we should be honest.\n\n\"With hindsight, I wish I'd never turned it on because of the stress and upheaval it caused. They told us we all had to get off the flight for a check with the doctor.\n\n\"They gave us in-transit cards, but then immediately said 'you can't get back on'.\n\n\"The captain said we couldn't get back on in case we had to take a medical diversion. We'd left everything on there. I didn't have my passport or anything.\n\n\"My husband is diabetic and started to go hypo because he didn't have any of his snacks.\n\n\"Hours later with nothing to eat or drink but a box of juice and some biscuits, we were told we wouldn't be flying at all.\n\n\"It was a nightmare. It wasn't like everyone was being sick or queuing for the bathroom.\"\n\nPassengers say that hours later, everyone was given a doctor\u2019s note confirming their fitness to fly.\n\nTo make matters worse, the couple was transferred to a different hotel for two nights.\n\n(Image: MEN Media)\n\nMichaela and James managed to get a flight to London Gatwick on Tuesday, October 8 and eventually made it home on Wednesday morning.\n\nOthers waited even longer and were flown to Manchester via the nearby island of Sal and Brussels.\n\nA TUI spokesperson said: \"We can confirm as a precautionary measure any passengers reporting symptoms consistent with gastroenteritis were removed from flight TOM227 before departure from Cape Verde earlier this month.\n\n\"The passengers were taken to a medical facility and given temporary accommodation until they obtained a fit to fly certificate.\n\n\"Alternative flights to the UK were then arranged, along with any transport where necessary.\n\n\"The safety and wellbeing of our customers and crew is always our highest priority.\n\n\"We are in contact with all affected customers to apologise for any inconvenience to their holiday.\"", "description": "TUI was supposed to take the 47 passengers from Boa Vista Airport to Manchester but they had to wait two further days to get home, after a gastric illness hit the island", "authors": ["Charlotte Dobson", "Image", "Lightrocket Via Getty Images", "Men Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20755011.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_James-and-Michaela-McLachlanJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
