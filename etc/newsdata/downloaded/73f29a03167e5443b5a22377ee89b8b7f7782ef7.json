Avni went from 25 stone 6lb to 13 stone 6lb and Emrah went from weighing 17 stone 10lb to 11 stone 13l\n\nEmrah got pregnant with Caren (right) after losing almost six pounds. Three months after her birth in August 2018, Emrah was pregnant again with Jeyla (left), who was born in September 2019. Pictured: Avni and Emrah after their weight loss, with their two daughters\n\nEmrah said: 'Avni and I had grown really comfortable with each other which probably aided our weight gain.\n\n'I\u2019ve suffered with polysystic ovaries for a long time too, so I knew conceiving wouldn\u2019t be easy.\n\n'Avni and I come from a Turkish Cypriot background so food has been a big part of both our lives for a long time.\n\n'We would overindulge on things like carbohydrate heavy-meals with lots of pasta or potatoes in particular.\n\nThe couple (pictured after losing the weight) decided to go on a diet after Avni was sent to the hospital due to respiratory difficulties back in 2016\n\nEmrah and Avni admitted to overindulging on carb-heavy meals prior to their diet (pictured). But changed their ways in early 2017 (pictured before losing the weight)\n\nAvni and Emrah beaming at her baby shower while she was pregnant with Jeyla. The couple were over the moon when they learn she was pregnant with Ceren after years of trying to conceive their third child\n\nCeren (pictured) was born on August 14 2019 after her parents lost a combined 18 stone. Soon, her baby sister Jeyla (right) followed\n\nProud mother Emrah with her youngest daughter, Jeyla, who was born on 18 September 2019, thirteen months after her sister Ceren was born\n\n'But we decided to ditch our unhealthy ways and join The 1:1 Diet in the hope it would help us conceive naturally after eight years of trying.\n\n'December 2017 I was just 2lb away from reaching my six stone loss, and my weight loss coach said to me I looked tired and she was a little concerned because I hadn\u2019t been looking myself.\n\n'I\u2019d mentioned my period had been late, but this was always quite normal for me, but she advised I do a pregnancy test anyway.\n\nEmrah showing off her new frame after her weight loss.

Emrah explained that food was really important in their life due to their Cypriot upbringing\n\nAvni had to be rushed to the hospital due to respiratory problems back in 2016. The couple decided to lose weight shortly after\n\n'I was completely gob smacked when I saw my positive pregnancy test - Avni and I had pretty much lost hope of conceiving naturally.\n\n'But to then fall pregnant naturally again in just 13 months was just unbelievable!\n\n'We honestly couldn\u2019t believe our luck.'\n\nPrior to Emrah getting pregnant with the first of their two miracles, Avni suffered a health scare which kick started the couples\u2019 decision to lose weight.\n\nAvni and Emrah's diet before: Breakfast - Toast or cereal Lunch - sandwich, crisps, chocolate and a yoghurt Dinner - steak, jacket potato with cheese, beans and salad Snacks - chocolate bars and crisps\n\nAvni and Emrah's diet after: Breakfast - poached eggs and tomatoes Lunch - chicken salad Dinner - salmon veg and sweet potato Snacks - fruit, cucumber sticks or carrot sticks\n\nEmrah said: 'In August 2016, Avni ended up being rushed to hospital with breathing difficulties which was really worrying.\n\n'This wasn\u2019t helped by his 25 stone frame either - after being looked over by the doctor, Avni was told he was on the verge of type two diabetes.\n\n'At this point, this is when we both knew we desperately needed to make a change to our diet and lifestyle.'\n\nEmrah and Avni, who have two older children Cenel, 11, and Jeyan, nine, had always wanted four children and tried for eight years to try expand their family.\n\nA happy family.
