(J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nThe Supreme Court has a powerfully controversial docket for its term beginning Monday that will test Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.\u2019s efforts to portray the institution as above the noisy and partisan battles of the moment.\n\nTwo unknowns \u2014 the health of the court\u2019s oldest member, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and whether the court will be drawn into legal controversies arising from the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into President Trump \u2014 add to the uncertainty.\n\nResolution of the most contentious cases could happen in June, in the heat of a presidential campaign in which the future of the court has emerged as a galvanizing issue for conservatives and liberals.\n\nOn the court\u2019s agenda:\n\n\u25cfWhether federal law protects LGBTQ workers from discrimination or being fired.\n\n\u25cfWhether the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to end the Obama-era program that protects immigrants brought to this country as children are lawful.\n\n\u25cfThe first Second Amendment claim involving gun ownership in more than a decade.\n\n\u25cfWhether a state may withhold aid to private religious schools if it offers funding to secular ones.\n\n\u25cfAn abortion case that gives the court\u2019s new conservatives an opportunity to begin reconstructing its jurisprudence on what is perhaps the nation\u2019s most divisive subject.\n\nOn the horizon, there are cases that could redefine when the government must give greater deference to a person\u2019s religious beliefs and perhaps even a third trip to the high court for the Affordable Care Act.\n\n[Supreme Court term begins with a big question: Is it legal to fire workers for being gay?]\n\nLast term, after the partisan bitterness that accompanied Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s ascension to the court, the justices sought common ground on some issues and put off others \u2014 abortion restrictions, for instance, and Barack Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n\nThe delay is over, and the conservative majority \u2014 bolstered by Kavanaugh and Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, Trump\u2019s other appointee \u2014 is in position to be more assertive this term, according to those who watch the court.\n\n\u201cProbably not the revolution that some seek and others fear, but we will likely see a court moving further and faster in a rightward direction,\u201d said Irv Gornstein, executive director of the Georgetown Law Center\u2019s Supreme Court Institute. \u201cThe docket almost guarantees it.\u201d\n\nSome conservatives see opportunity.\n\n\u201cI actually can\u2019t recall a time in the last 20 years that there were this many key issues that seemed ready for decision and primed for decision and a court that seems open to them,\u201d said Mark Rienzi, president of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty.\n\nDetermining how far and how fast the court moves is Roberts, 64, entering his 15th year as chief justice and his second as the court\u2019s pivotal member.\n\nSince the retirement of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy in 2018, Roberts is the median between four more conservative colleagues on one side and four liberals on the other.\n\nHe uses every public appearance to try to persuade that the court \u2014 with conservatives chosen by Republican presidents and liberals by Democratic ones \u2014 may be ideological but is not partisan.\n\n\u201cWhen you live in a politically polarized environment, people tend to see everything in those terms,\u201d Roberts said last month at an event at New York\u2019s Temple Emanu-El. \u201cThat\u2019s not how we at the court function, and the results in our cases do not suggest otherwise.\u201d\n\n[Is Supreme Court too deferential to Trump or sending message to judges?]\n\nRoberts has noted the range of majority lineups last term, even in cases that divided 5 to 4. The court\u2019s dominant conservatives made up the majority in only about one-third.\n\nIn the last term\u2019s two most politically important cases \u2014 whether federal courts have a role in policing electoral maps for extreme partisan gerrymandering and whether the Trump administration could add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census forms \u2014 Roberts gave his first glimpses of how he might play his pivotal role.\n\nHe voted no in the gerrymandering case, joined by the conservatives, and no in the Census case, joined by the liberals.\n\nAt the event in Manhattan, Roberts lamented that the discord between the legislative and executive branches leaves the court with more decisions to make.\n\n\u201cWe do seem to be getting more and more involved in every aspect of society in a way that would have been surprising to the framers of the Constitution,\u201d Roberts said at one point.\n\nAt a Supreme Court preview at George Washington University\u2019s law school, Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund noted that the court remains \u201cthe most powerful body in this country.\u201d\n\nDavid Cole, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said that last term, \u201cthe court seemed to have done everything it could to rise above the partisan rancor to not be divided along partisan lines in the ways so much else is in our society.\u201d He added: \u201cThis term, it\u2019s going to be harder.\u201d\n\nThe court\u2019s decisions will affect 800,000 \u201cdreamers,\u201d in the DACA case, Cole noted, millions of \u00adLGBTQ workers in deciding whether federal discrimination laws protect on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation, and \u201chalf the country\u201d in the abortion case.\n\n\u201cIt will be a momentous term for the rights of individuals,\u201d Cole said.\n\nSome conservatives say the court\u2019s push to prove its nonpartisanship is a one-way street: that the expectation is, one of the justices on the right must bend to join the liberals, who vote more consistently as a group.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about a pattern of increasing threats to judicial independence,\u201d said Carrie Severino of the Judicial Crisis Network. She and other conservatives have expressed outrage about a brief filed by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and four other Democratic senators in the gun case that warned the court in stark terms that it is perceived as partisan and beholden to conservative groups.\n\n[Threat? A Supreme Court brief by Democratic senators ignites controversy]\n\nSeverino called it a \u201cthinly veiled ultimatum to Chief Justice Roberts . . . suggesting that if the Court didn\u2019t rule as [Whitehouse] requested that he would proceed with legislation to pack the court.\u201d\n\nThe abortion case the court accepted Friday puts Roberts in a particularly bright spotlight.\n\nThe court said it will review a Louisiana law that requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. It is almost identical to a Texas law that the court struck down in 2016, saying the requirement was meant more to hobble abortion clinics and restrict women\u2019s access to the procedure than to protect their health.\n\nRoberts was a dissenter in the Texas case, but he joined the liberals in February to keep the Louisiana law from going into effect after a lower court approved it.\n\n\u201cIt will reveal probably more than any case this term this emerging role of Roberts as the swing vote,\u201d said Jonathan Turley, a GWU law professor.\n\nSome events are beyond the court\u2019s control.\n\nGinsburg\u2019s health is one of them. In December, the senior liberal member of the court had part of one lung removed after cancer was discovered. The recovery caused her to miss a round of oral arguments for the first time in 26 years on the bench.\n\nThis summer, the 86-year-old announced she had undergone radiation treatment for a tumor on her pancreas.\n\nShe has counteracted the worries about her condition with an impressive show of vigor: nearly a dozen speaking engagements over the past month-plus, traveling to Buffalo, Chicago, Little Rock, New York and elsewhere.\n\nBut if her health forced her from her seat, the Republican Senate has made clear it would move quickly to ensure Trump would name her replacement and solidify conservative control of the court.\n\nAnother potential controversy for the court: the impeachment inquiry. Nothing would put the court more in the political spotlight than having to rule on issues related to the proceedings against the president.\n\nBut lawsuits seeking Trump\u2019s tax returns and alleging he\u2019s violating the Constitution with transactions through his family business with foreign governments are making their way through the legal process.\n\nCongressional subpoenas for information from the executive branch are being ignored, and some on the left say the judiciary has a role to play in enforcing them.\n\n\u201cWhere the House is seeking information that is relevant to its determination whether to impeach the president, it needs that information as quickly as possible,\u201d said Brianne Gorod, chief counsel of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center.\n\nPhilip Bump in New York contributed to this report.", "description": "Resolution of the most divisive issues will occur in the heat of next year\u2019s presidential race.", "authors": ["Robert Barnes", "Reporter Covering The U.S. Supreme Court", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2JldVqEEaVaoWlAARIDvEvdFy-s=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JPZKSFWQ5MI6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
