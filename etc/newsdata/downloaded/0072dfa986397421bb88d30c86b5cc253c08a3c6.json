The first two models to go on sale will be the $152,250 Taycan Turbo and the $186,350 Taycan Turbo S. The Turbo has 670 horsepower and the Turbo S has 750 horsepower, and both use a 93.4-kWh battery pack (an EPA range estimate for the Taycan is still pending).\n\nThat starting price may not sound too crazy considering that the gas-powered Porsche Panamera Turbo starts at $154,350, but it makes this new EV significantly more expensive than its chief rival, the Tesla Model S. The Tesla has benefited from numerous price cuts as of late and its Performance trim, which offers 345 miles of range and a claimed zero-to-60-mph time of 2.4 seconds, now starts at $101,190. Even with all of its options, the Tesla tops out at $116,190.\n\nPhoto credit: Porsche More\n\nPorsche has not released option pricing for the Taycan, but we assume that it will follow the company's convention and offer a wide range of hugely expensive extras. Porsche does say that the first examples of the car will come equipped with certain options such as the panoramic sunroof, meaning they will start $2610 higher. The first examples of the Taycan will go on sale by the end of 2019.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The 670-hp Taycan Turbo starts at $152,250 and the 750-hp Turbo S starts at a steep $186,350.", "authors": ["Joey Capparella"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6vll4zdE_uEFSi5eUL4X.A--~B/aD03MjM7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/dbd927501e32588eb8109fd0a9037029", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
