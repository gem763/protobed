While Hodges filled in admirably after Rudolph woozily made his way off the field and to a nearby hospital for further evaluation, the Ravens pulled out a 26-23 overtime victory that could have a significant ripple effect on both teams\u2019 seasons.\n\nBaltimore (3-2) snapped a two-game skid when safety Marlon Humphrey stripped Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster and recovered the fumble at the Pittsburgh 34 early in the extra period. Justin Tucker slipped a 46-yard field goal through the uprights four plays later as the Ravens won at Heinz Field for a second straight season.\n\n\u201c(When overtime started) I was on the sideline and I was thinking, \u2018Whatever happens right now, somebody\u2019s going to make a big play and going to be remembered forever in the outcome of this game,\u2019\u201d Humphrey said.\n\nMaybe, but for all the weirdness of the game - from Lamar Jackson\u2019s three interceptions to Steelers coach Mike Tomlin\u2019s decision to kick off in overtime instead of taking the ball to another crucial late-game fumble by Smith-Schuster - it\u2019s the visual of Rudolph unconscious on the turf in a silent stadium that will linger.\n\nTrailing 17-13 and facing third-and-11 at the Pittsburgh 12 midway through the third quarter, Rudolph lined up in the shotgun and dropped back to pass. The play broke down and Rudolph scrambled to his left, stepping up the field in the process. He flicked the ball to teammate James Washington just before the crown of Thomas\u2019 helmet hit Rudolph under the chin. Rudolph limply fell to the ground and laid there with his eyes closed while medical personnel rushed to attend to him.\n\n\u201cI was just flying to the ball like I normally do,\u201d said Thomas, who signed with Baltimore in the offseason after becoming a perennial Pro Bowler with Seattle. \u201cI was asking the ref what happened and they said upstairs said that a part of my helmet kind of hit him in the chin, and that\u2019s what caused the flag. I still believe that it wasn\u2019t intentional on my part.\u201d\n\nRudolph eventually came to as trainers cut off his face mask. He needed to be helped off the field by his teammates because the cart used to treat seriously hurt players stalled. Tomlin wasn\u2019t sure why the cart wasn\u2019t working.\n\n\u201cAsk somebody that is in charge of that,\u201d Tomlin said. \u201cI don\u2019t drive carts and things of that nature.\u201d\n\nThe scene of players on both sides going down to one knee while Rudolph was being treated was eerily similar to the on-field reaction in Cincinnati in December 2017 when Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier sustained a spinal injury. Shazier, currently on the physically unable to perform list while he continues his rehab from spinal stabilization surgery, walked over to Rudolph and briefly comforted him as Rudolph made his way to the locker room for further treatment and examination as the crowd chanted \u201cThrow him out!\u201d at Thomas.\n\n\u201cWhen you see somebody lying lifeless like that it kind of strikes a bell,\u201d Pittsburgh linebacker Bud Dupree said. \u201cAny human being that cares about somebody in that type of situation will feel a certain way. \u2026 When something like that happens, it makes a trigger go off in your brain and you\u2019ve got to control yourself.\u201d\n\nBaltimore coach John Harbaugh likened the hit to \u201ckind of like a boxing deal,\u201d adding he did not believe it was Thomas\u2019 intent to hit the 6-foot-5 Rudolph so high.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fast and he\u2019s closing and Mason is running and he\u2019s not going down, throwing the ball,\u201d Harbaugh said.\n\nPittsburgh (1-4) did not fold after being forced to go with Hodges, an undrafted rookie free agent out of Samford who was signed to be a \u201ccamp\u201d arm before organized team activities. He trotted onto the field when Rudolph slipped out of view and hardly looked nervous. He completed 7 of 9 passes for 68 yards and also had a 21-yard sprint to set up Chris Boswell\u2019s go-ahead field goal with 2:41 to play.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t quite enough to put away the Ravens. Jackson - with the help of a roughing the passer call on Steelers linebacker Ola Adeniyi - moved Baltimore in range to have Tucker tie it with 14 seconds to go.\n\nCALCULATED RISK\n\nPittsburgh won the coin toss to start overtime, but curiously opted to kick the ball rather than receive it even though an offensive touchdown would have ended the game. Tomlin pointed to his team\u2019s ineffective kickoff return unit as one of the reasons for the decision. Tucker had consistently pinned the Steelers deep in their own territory throughout the game. It worked. Pittsburgh forced a punt and took over at its 34 before Humphrey\u2019s expertly timed forced fumble on Smith-Schuster swung the balance to the Ravens for good.\n\n\u201cI put the defense on the field in an effort to fight for field position and get the onus on them to get the stop,\u201d Tomlin said.\n\nINJURIES\n\nRavens: Safety Tony Jefferson went down in the fourth quarter with a left knee injury.\n\nSteelers: Washington left in the third quarter with a shoulder injury and did not return. Linebacker Mark Barron exited in the second quarter with a hamstring injury.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRavens: Hosts AFC North rival Cincinnati next Sunday. The teams split their two meetings in 2018.\n\nSteelers: Visit Los Angeles to face the Chargers next Sunday. Los Angeles beat the Steelers in Pittsburgh 33-30 last season.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Thomas' crunching hit to Rudolph's chin left Rudolph with a concussion and Pittsburgh's season in the hands of undrafted rookie free agent quarterback Devlin Hodges.
