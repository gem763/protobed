It has eluded me throughout my career from college onwards,\u201d said Gatlin.\n\n\u201cI take my hat off to my team-mates. They broke that curse tonight of the USA dropping the baton and I really appreciate them giving me the gift today.\u201d\n\nFraser-Pryce added the relay title \u2014 her fourth in the event \u2014 to the 100m individual gold and her ninth overall in the history of the championships.\n\nThe 32-year-old was full of praise for her trio of less experienced team-mates.\n\n\u201cIt is a pleasure to be amongst the younger athletes and seeing them come out and winning speaks volumes for the team,\u201d said Fraser-Pryce.\n\nSunday\u2019s climax to the championship will be missing several world and Olympic champions after they failed to come through qualifying.\n\nBrianna McNeal did not even make it over the first hurdle as the 2016 Olympic 100 metres hurdler was called for a false start and left the track in tears.\n\nGermany\u2019s javelin Olympic champion Thomas Rohler also departed the Khalifa Stadium in tears having fallen short of the top 12 who qualified for the final.\n\nAmerican long jump great Brittney Reese is too seasoned a performer to lapse into tears but the 2012 Olympic champion and defending title holder came up short in her event.\n\n\u201cI just need to go punch something, I\u2019ll be okay,\u201d said the 33-year-old quadruple outdoor world champion.", "description": "Doha (AFP) \u2013 Sifan Hassan made light of the doping ban handed to her coach Alberto Salazar to complete an historic 1500/10,000 metres double at the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/05/c499d3_netherlands-sifan-hassan-added-world-500-metres-title-secure-an-historic-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
