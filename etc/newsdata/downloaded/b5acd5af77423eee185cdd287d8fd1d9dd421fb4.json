Some analysts say it seeking to rally support from the anti-Castro exile community in the swing state of Florida ahead of next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nMany Cubans complain the measures are hurting the Cuban people. The country is suffering a major fuel shortage and the private sector is reeling from a sharp decline in tourism.", "description": "Cuba said on Monday the Trump administration denied its health minister a visa to attend a Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) meeting in Washington and accused the United States of repeatedly violating its obligations as the host of an international organization.", "authors": ["Sarah Marsh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
