R\u00edan was nine months old, and Declan was 3. Like so many working parents, I was all too aware that I would never get to redo the parts of their early months and years that whirred by during 14-hour days on the job. I told myself that I was \u201cbinging\u201d in my work life, and that the day would come when I would binge with my family, creating a permanent home for the four of us. Still, every couple of months I had tried to step back to assess whether I was getting enough done in my job to justify all the time away. Even during productive periods, I never felt great about my choices.\n\nIn this short spell before I descended again into full-time national-security work, I relished the time with R\u00edan, who was nearly walking, and Declan, whom I taught to swim and brought to his first Washington Nationals baseball games. Then, in late May 2013, the main White House lawyer reviewing my files called to inform me that I had cleared the vetting process. My nomination would be announced imminently.\n\nSamantha Power: Bystanders to genocide\n\nIn a remarkable coincidence of timing, Cass and I had been invited to dine with the president, Michelle Obama, and a few of their friends at the White House residence that very night. In anticipation, I had recruited my stepfather, Edmund Bourke, to make the drive down from New York to babysit. Eddie, as he was known, had become my stepfather when my mother moved my 5-year-old brother and 9-year-old me to Pittsburgh from Dublin, Ireland, in 1979.\n\nA few minutes late, we were escorted up to the Obamas\u2019 home and out onto their balcony overlooking the National Mall. Obama was already holding forth, and as we entered, Cass accidentally knocked over a glass. Obama laughed, recalling Cass\u2019s notorious messiness when they were colleagues at the University of Chicago Law School.\n\n\u201cLeave it to Cass,\u201d the president said, \u201cto break the White House.\u201d\n\nAfter half an hour of small talk on the outdoor portico, we were called to dinner. Just as I walked back into the residence, my phone rang. I had given Eddie explicit instructions for feeding R\u00edan, who was a fussy eater. He was now calling me in a state of panic, unable to find R\u00edan\u2019s pumped milk. Instead, he had settled on something white that didn\u2019t smell like milk and wasn\u2019t flowing through the small hole in R\u00edan\u2019s bottle, causing her to complain loudly.\n\nRealizing that he had mistakenly attempted to feed her rice water, I ducked down the hallway to try to calm my frazzled babysitter while the president treated the other guests to a quick stop in Abraham Lincoln\u2019s bedroom, showing them the only copy of the Gettysburg Address personally signed by the 16th president.\n\nExplaining the logistics of baby care to Eddie by phone was like trying to explain the complexities of a new tech gadget: What seemed straightforward to me just wasn\u2019t obvious to a man in his 70s. He became frustrated, I then grew exasperated, and both of us ended up practically shouting. This had happened many times before, but never in such close proximity to Lincoln\u2019s bedroom. As our conversation escalated in its inevitable way, I suddenly heard a voice behind me.", "description": "The former UN ambassador recalls the moment President Obama asked her to serve.", "authors": ["Samantha Power", "Former U.S. Ambassador To The United Nations"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/RTX2QVDY/facebook.jpg?1567520357", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
