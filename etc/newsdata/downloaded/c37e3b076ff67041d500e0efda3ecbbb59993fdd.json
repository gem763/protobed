The thing is, he might give you 25 touches and he uses the ball really well, but what he does with his gut running, he pushes so hard that it opens up all the defence,\u201d Crawford told SEN Breakfast.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden they have to open up and be very cautious of someone running towards the goals.", "description": "Trade negotiations between St Kilda and Fremantle are reportedly on the verge of falling apart.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/44b418256f8471f55471dea38fb820c5?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
