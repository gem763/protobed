It paid $67 billion for DirecTV in 2015, and it doled out another $85 billion in 2018 for Time Warner, all in an attempt to transform itself into a media conglomerate. The company now owns some top-notch media assets, but its strategy, especially around streaming, is an incoherent mess.\n\nThese acquisitions have dialed up the risk for AT&T, since they've loaded up the balance sheet with a scary amount of debt. Total debt was roughly $170 billion at the end of the second quarter, not counting another $21 billion in pension obligations. That's the most debt for any nonfinancial and non-government-owned company in the world, according to Bloomberg.\n\nInvestors haven't really bought into the story AT&T is trying to tell. The stock trades below its multiyear high, and it goes for just 10 times the company's guidance for full-year free cash flow. That's a big discount to the broader market, but it reflects legitimate concerns about debt and strategy.\n\nBillionaire Paul Singer and his Elliot Management are concerned about AT&T's strategy as well. The hedge fund unveiled a $3.2 billion stake in the company on Monday, and it called for big changes in a letter to its board of directors. If implemented, Elliot believes the stock could soar past $60 per share.\n\nThe AT&T logo. More\n\nDeal making gone wrong\n\nElliot called AT&T \"one of the world's most important companies and one of America's proudest technological stories\" in its letter to the board, but also detailed missteps and setbacks that have hurt shareholder returns. Over the past decade, Elliot claims that AT&T stock has underperformed the broader market by more than 150 percentage points.\n\nThe company's acquisition strategy is Elliot's biggest complaint. The most damaging deal, according to the hedge fund, was actually one that failed. AT&T tried to acquire T-Mobile in 2011 for $39 billion, but the deal was blocked by regulators. AT&T paid T-Mobile a multibillion-dollar breakup fee and handed it a roaming deal that helped make T-Mobile a tougher competitor in the years ahead.\n\nElliot also criticized the acquisition of DirecTV, which occurred \"at the absolute peak of the linear TV market.\" AT&T has been hemorrhaging TV subscribers, and it's even been losing subscribers for its DirecTV NOW on-demand service, which is now known as AT&T TV NOW. Confusingly, this service is separate from AT&T TV, a different service offered by the company.\n\nOn the Time Warner deal, Elliot praised the company's \"collection of some of the world's premier media assets.\" But it pointed out that AT&T has yet to convincingly explain why it needed to own Time Warner. The hedge fund remains cautious on the benefits of the deal, especially given that it's already been nearly three years since the deal was first announced.\n\n\"We firmly believe that AT&T's M&A strategy has not only contributed directly to its profound share price underperformance, but has also caused distractions that have contributed to the Company's recent operational underperformance,\" reads Elliot's letter.\n\nOn the operational front, Elliot pointed to stumbles with the original exclusive iPhone launch in 2007, a sluggish rollout of 4G LTE, and a lack of clear brand positioning in the minds of consumers as problems that have contributed to weak stock performance over the past decade.", "description": "The hedge fund's plan for AT&T makes more sense than the company's current strategy.", "authors": ["Timothy Green", "The Motley Fool"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MJtlF82E4H4cHZH8om03Fw--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/motleyfool.com/d3236efed027c6e5c9f7d2738d6507c4", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
