I\u2019d done some little comedy stuff before but I measure the beginning of my actual time as a professional comic from me becoming the original MC of The Comedy Store in 1979 when it opened.\n\nAlexei with Nigel Planer in The Young Ones\n\nHoused in a strip club in Soho with the show not starting till midnight those were some wild nights and I guess that would have to be the first highlight, not just the opening show but the nine months I was in charge there when I met amongst others, Rik Mayall, Ade Edmonson, Nigel Planer and Peter Richardson as well as French and Saunders and we began to completely overhaul what British comedy could be in a new and better way.\n\nThen the same group of people did the same thing for TV with the first series of The Young Ones and the first series of The Comic Strip Presents in 1982. The former was a show which completely re-invented the sitcom and took it in an amazing and radical direction. I think I have never been happier than during those recordings of The Young Ones. There is no more satisfying feeling than working with your friends on something you know is good and you are pretty certain is going to be a hit.\n\n(This article is making me feel like a megalomaniac, usually I do not dwell on the highlights of my career; I am happier thinking about the many disasters and failures but writing this piece has made me into a Donald Trump-style blowhard going on and on about how great my success has been. If I start a war with North Korea it\u2019s all your fault).", "description": "The comedy great marks his return to Radio 4 by surveying the peaks of a brilliant career.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p05mkv6t.jpg"}
