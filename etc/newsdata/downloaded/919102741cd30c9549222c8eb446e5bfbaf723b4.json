(UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/Handout via Reuters)\n\nTortuous Brexit crisis\n\nThe EU, which has grappled with the tortuous Brexit crisis since Britons voted 52 per cent to 48 per cent to leave in a 2016 referendum, was clearly bewildered by the contradictory signals from London.\n\nWith Brexit up in the air, the bloc's ambassadors decided on Sunday to play for time rather than rush to decide on Johnson's request.\n\nFrom the EU's point of view, extension options range from just an additional month until the end of November to half a year or longer.\n\n\"We're looking for more clarity towards the end of the week, hoping that by that time we will also see how things develop in London,\" one senior EU diplomat said.\n\nIt was unlikely that the EU's 27 remaining member states would refuse the U.K.'s request to delay once again its departure, given the impact on all parties of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nIn London, Johnson's ministers said they were confident they had the numbers to push a deal through Parliament where opponents were plotting to derail the deal he had assured the EU that he could ratify.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party was planning changes to the deal that would make it unacceptable to swathes of Johnson's own party including a proposals for another referendum.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson will again try to put his Brexit deal to a vote in the U.K.\u00a0Parliament on Monday after he was forced by his opponents to send a letter seeking a delay from the European Union.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5328505.1571651314!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/britain-eu-parliament.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
