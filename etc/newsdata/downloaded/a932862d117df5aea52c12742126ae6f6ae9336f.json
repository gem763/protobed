This move ensures the reemergence of ISIS.\n\n\u2018Will lead effort in Congress to make Erdogan pay a heavy price.\u2019\n\nGraham added: \u2018I urge President Trump to change course while there is still time by going back to the safe zone concept that was working.\u2019\n\nSmoke rises from the town of Ras al-Ain in Syria\u2019s Hasakeh province after it was bombed by Turkey on Wednesday (Picture: AFP)\n\nThe Republican politician\u2019s blistering attack on President Trump is a marked departure for Graham\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe previously defended Trump through dozens of dramas that have dogged the president\u2019s time in the White House.\n\nWashington DC insiders have claimed the two men have not spoken since Monday, when Trump announced his plans.\n\nGraham was moved to speak out after President Trump pulled US troops out of Northern Syria, where they had been working alongside allied Kurdish forces, known as the YPG.\n\nThat area has since been invaded by Turkey, with which it shares a border, leaving the Kurds at the mercy of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nErdogan considers the YPG a terrorist organization, and has repeatedly resisted calls by the Kurds for their own autonomous region.\n\nOn Monday, Trump tweeted a bloodcurdling threat to Erdogan in an apparent attempt to warn the Turkish leader off attacking the curds.\n\nHe wrote: \u2018As I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits,\n\n\u2018I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!).\n\n\u2018They must, with Europe and others, watch over the captured ISIS fighters and families.\n\n\u2018The U.S. has done far more than anyone could have ever expected, including the capture of 100% of the ISIS Caliphate.\n\n\u2018It is time now for others in the region, some of great wealth, to protect their own territory. THE USA IS GREAT!\u2019\n\nThe YPG have been credited for helping to obliterate Isis strongholds in Northern Syria, and keep the terror group from reforming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStrategists say Trump\u2019s decision to pull US troops out of the region will likely lead to a resurgence in Isis activity, and puts the world at higher risk of associated terror attacks.\n\nErdogan insists he wants to maintain a safe zone in Northern Syria. Critics have long accused him of trying to impose an Islamist, authoritarian regime on his secular nation.", "description": "South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham - who has repeatedly defended Trump's most outlandish behavior - has finally gone on the attack after Trump pulled troops out of Northern Syria", "authors": ["Jimmy Mccloskey"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/comp-1570632997_1570635662.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
