The company's share price plummeted in the days after the diesel emissions scandal erupted.\n\nVolkswagen on Tuesday rejected the accusations and the company remains convinced that it fulfilled all its information obligations under capital market law, Hiltrud Dorothea Werner, Member of the Board of Management for Integrity and Legal Affairs, said.\n\n\"If there is a trial, we are confident that the allegations will prove to be unfounded,\" she said.\n\nA spokesman for Volkswagen's supervisory board said that the chairman's committee would meet \"immediately\" to discuss further proceedings on the charges.\n\nWrite to Max Bernhard at max.bernhard@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 24, 2019 06:53 ET (10:53 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
