Masculine adjectives included \"ambitious\" and \"has leadership abilities\"; feminine adjectives included \"shy\" and \"childlike\"\n\nWomen were told to sit cross-legged and not to make face-to-face contact with men at work\n\nThe presenter claimed women had smaller brains than men, a former EY executive director who wished to remain anonymous told Huffington Post. She added the presentation said women absorb information \"like pancakes\" making it hard for them to focus.\n\nThe presentation also had a breakdown of the difference between men and women's speaking styles, where it said women ramble and \"miss the point\" when they communicate, and \"think men hog air time.\" Studies show men interrupt women and dominate workplace conversations: a 2014 study found women interrupted men just once during three-minute conversations, while men averaged 2.6 interruptions of women during those three minutes.\n\nBusiness Insider reached out to EY for additional comment.\n\nThe training reportedly occurred in June 2018, at the height of the #MeToo movement where women across the country shared stories of sexual harassment at work. EY itself faced two sexual harassment complaints, while rival accounting firm Deloitte fired 20 partners for misconduct.\n\nPromoting gender stereotypes at work may also result in excluding non-conforming employees. Half of LGBTQ employees have experienced verbal discrimination at work, and queer people have high rates of workplace sexual harassment.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "According to a HuffPost report, women were encouraged to \"signal fitness and wellness\" by getting manicures and wearing flattering clothing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7427/5ff9762218ad43ce97f8c9b63b59f3eb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
