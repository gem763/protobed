Shape Created with Sketch. 47 brilliant films that didn't receive a single Oscar nomination 1/47 American Psycho (2000) Starring future Oscar-winner Christian Bale, Mary Harron\u2019s adaptation of the Bret Easton Ellis novel \u2013 in which the Vice star plays the psychopathic Patrick Bateman - didn\u2019t receive a single nomination. Rex Features 2/47 Before Sunrise (1995) While the final two chapters of Richard Linklater\u2019s Before\u2026 trilogy earned screenplay nominations, the film that introduced the world to future married couple Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) was criminally overlooked. Columbia Pictures 3/47 The Big Heat (1953) Fritz Lang had a number of films overlooked by the Academy; this noir, starring Glenn Ford, Lee Marvin and and Gloria Grahame, was one of them. Columbia Pictures 4/47 The Big Lebowski (1998) The Academy\u2019s generosity to the Coen brothers peaked when No Country for Old Men beat There Will Be Blood in one of the ceremony\u2019s closest Best Picture races of all time. It remains surprising that one of their few films to evade any nominations is this endlessly quotable mistaken identity comedy starring Jeff Bridges as The Dude. PolyGram Filmed Entertainment 5/47 Blow Out (1981) Brian De Palma doesn\u2019t exactly make films in the hope of winning award, but his political thriller - based on Michelangelo Antonioni\u2019s Blow Up \u2013 would have deserved any Oscar it was nominated for. Filmways Pictures 6/47 Breathless (1960) Breathless' failure to receive a nomination is proof that the Oscars can\u2019t be trusted. Despite being one of the most studied films in the world, Jean Luc-Godard\u2019s French masterpiece has an Academy Award tally of zero. Films Around The World 7/47 Bringing Up Baby (1938) The Academy rewarded many notable screwball comedies, though this Howard Hawks-directed standout starring Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn - who\u2019d go on to hold the record for most wins - wasn't one of them. Courtesy of BFI 8/47 Don't Look Now (1973) Nicolas Roeg, who directed this Venice-set chiller, is one of the most unfairly overlooked directors in Oscars history. Rex Features 9/47 Donnie Darko (2004) Richard Kelly\u2019s science-fiction mind-bender, which made a star of Jake Gyllenhaal, was a festival favourite upon its debut in 2004. Many expected a screenplay nomination to manifest. Rex Features 10/47 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) It wouldn\u2019t be until the 1990s that western films found favour with the Academy. It was ironically thanks to Unforgiven, a film directed by Clint Eastwood whose career flourished after starring in this Sergio Leone film that many consider to be the genre\u2019s peak. 11/47 La haine (1995) Mathieu Kassovitz\u2019s black-and-white drama \u2013 translated in English as Hate \u2013 follows three young friends and their struggles living in the suburbs of Paris. 12/47 Halloween (1978) The Academy may not be frothing at the mouth to nominate horror films, but do have previous (see: The Exorcist and The Silence of the Lamb), which makes the absence of John Carpenter\u2019s influential Halloween a glaring oversight. Aquarius Releasing 13/47 Harold and Maude (1971) This offbeat romantic drama was a critical and commercial flop at the time of release, which probably accounts for its lack of Oscar nominations. Today, though, it\u2019s cult following ensures it remains in good favour with film fans. Paramount Pictures 14/47 Heat (1995) On paper, the big screen union of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in Michael Mann\u2019s cop drama was a shoo-in for awards, but no Oscar nominations manifested. Warner Bros 15/47 His Girl Friday (1940) Yet another Howard Hawks screwball comedy starring Cary Grant that criminally failed to secure a single Oscar nomination. L/Columbia/Koba/Rex/Shutterstock 16/47 Insomnia (2002) While falling short of Christopher Nolan\u2019s best, modest drama Insomnia \u2013 made years before Batman Begins \u2013 had enough strong performances (Al Pacino, Robin Wiliams, Hilary Swank) to warrant acting nominations. Alas, it received none. Warner Bros Pictures 17/47 Local Hero (1983) Bill Forsyth\u2019s beloved comedy-drama follows the mishaps of an American man sent to buy up a Scottish village where the oil company he works for wants to build a refinery. Forsyth won the Bafta for Best Director, but the film received no such love from the Academy. 20th Century Fox 18/47 M (1931) You\u2019d be mistaken for thinking the \u201cM\u201d stands for \u201cmasterpiece\u201d in Fritz Lang\u2019s German drama that follows the manhunt for a serial killer - not that the Academy agreed. 20th Century Fox 19/47 A Man Escaped (1956) Robert Bresson\u2019s adaptation of Andr\u00e9 Devigny\u2019s memoirs charts the French Resistance member\u2019s time as prisoner of the Germans during World War II, and is even more enthralling considering Bresson himself was held captive years before. Gaumont Film Company 20/47 Margaret (2011) Kenneth Lonergan would go on to win an Oscar for Manchester but he Sea, but Margaret - his three-hour plus drama featuring a searing performance from Anna Paquin - failed to secure a single nomination. Fox Searchlight Pictures 21/47 In the Mood for Love (2000) Wong Kar-wai set the benchmark for romance in film with his acclaimed Hong Kong drama following a man and woman (Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung) who develop feelings for one another after suspecting their respective spouses of having an affair together. defd Deutscher Fernsehdienst 22/47 The King of Comedy (1982) It may have taken him decades to win an Oscar, but the Academy has rarely balked at nominating Martin Scorsese films \u2013 especially for films starring Robert De Niro. The King of Comedy was an exception. 20th Century Fox 23/47 The Long Goodbye (1973) Robert Altman\u2019s superior thriller stars Elliott Gould as Raymond Chandler\u2019s private investigator Philip Marlowe in one of the director\u2019s most entertaining films. The director would go on to be the recipient of the Honorary Award in 2006. 24/47 The Man With Two Brains (1983) He may have hosted several times, but Steve Martin has never been nominated for an Oscar. One film he deserved recognition for was Carl Reiner's 1983 sci-fi comedy, The Man with Two Brains. Warner Bros. 25/47 A Matter of Life and Death (1946) The Academy Film Archive may have preserved A Matter of Life and Death in 1999, but voters failed to recognise the Powell & Pressburger\u2019s fantasy-romance at the time of its release in 1946. Eagle-Lion Films 26/47 Mean Streets (1973) It may not be credited as his debut, but Mean Streets is very much the first true Martin Scorsese film. The director would go on to win a belated Oscar for The Departed in 2007, but he\u2019d have to wait until 1975 for his first nomination (Alice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Anymore). Warner Bros 27/47 Melancholia (2011) No Lars von Trier film has ever been nominated for Best Picture, though Dancer in the Dark came close (it settled for a Best Original Song nomination). He came close with Melancholia, but ultimately, the drama didn't get Canal+ 28/47 Miller's Crossing (1990) Despite being revered as a Coen brothers favourite, not to mention its notable performances from Gabriel Byrne and Albert Finney, Miller\u2019s Crossing is one of few Coen brother films not to receive a single Oscar nomination. 20th Century Fox 29/47 Once Upon a Time in America (1984) Though it's by no means a masterpiece, it\u2019s staggering to think that Sergio Leone\u2019s gangster epic - starring Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci - didn\u2019t acquire any Oscar nominations (the film's music was disqualified from consideration after Warner Bros accidentally omitted the composer's name from the opening credits when trimming the film\u2019s lengthy running time for its American release). Warner Bros 30/47 Paterson (2016) Critics assumed Jim Jarmusch\u2019s Paterson would have been a shoo-in for awards recognition - most notably in the Best Actor category, thanks to a quietly fantastic performance from Adam Driver - but no such luck. Amazon Studios 31/47 Paths of Glory (1957) Stanley Kubrick never won Best Director despite being nominated four times. One of his films that didn\u2019t make the Oscars cut in any category was his black-and-white anti-war film, Paths of Glory. United Artists 32/47 Play Misty for Me (1971) Clint Eastwood would go onto become something of an Oscar darling thanks to Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby and Mystic River, but his directorial debut was ignored by the Academy. Univeral Pictures/Courtesy of Getty Images 33/47 Reservoir Dogs (1992) Reservoir Dogs may not touch Quentin Tarantino\u2019s best, but it remains a surprise that the filmmaker\u2019s debut didn\u2019t get recognised in the screenplay category, at least. Miramax Films 34/47 The Rider (2018) Of all the 2018 films to be snubbed at this year\u2019s Oscars, Chlo\u00e9 Zhao\u2019s drama - which stars a real-life rodeo cowboy and his family - smacks as the most unfair. Sony Pictures Classics 35/47 The Searchers (1956) The role of Civil War veteran Ethan Edwards might be considered John Wayne\u2019s best role, but the Academy didn\u2019t agree: he would win his sole Oscar for True Grit in 1970. Warner Bros 36/47 The Shining (1980) Another Kubrick film that was completely ignored by the Academy is the director\u2019s Stephen King adaptation, The Shining. Today, it\u2019s considered one of his finest works as well as being one of the most revered horror films of all time. Warner Bros 37/47 The Shop Around the Corner (1953) It may have endured as one of the best loved romcoms of all time, but it has zero Oscar nominations to its name. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer 38/47 Still Walking (2008) Japanese director Hirokazo Kore-eda's portrait of a family over roughly 24 hours as they commemorate the death of the eldest son was a glaring oversight by the Academy. IFC Films 39/47 Swingers Before he became Disney's go to, Jon Favreau (Iron Man, The Jungle Book and the forthcoming live-action Lion King) wrote this independent film about the lives of single, unemployed actors living in Hollywood, California during the 1990s swing revival. Rex Features 40/47 This Is England (2006 The 2007 ceremony would have been far better had Shane Meadows' coming-of-drama been in contention for awards. Optimum Releasing 41/47 Three Kings (1999) The Academy deemed Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle worthy of nominations, but not David O Russell\u2019s Three Kings, which remains one of his greatest films to this day. Warner Bros Pictures 42/47 Tokyo Story (1953) Tokyo Story is deemed Japanese filmmaker Yasujir\u014d Ozu's masterpiece and was named Sight & Sound's best film of all time in 2012. Rex Features 43/47 Touch of Evil (1958) Orson Welles' classic noir wasn't as well loved at the time of release as it is today. BFI 44/47 Tyrannosaur (2011) Olivia Colman may be in contention for Best Actress at this year\u2019s ceremony, but the fact she failed to earn a nomination (or Bafta, for that matter) for her role in Paddy Considine\u2019s hard-hitting drama Tyrannosaur is one of the biggest oversights in awards history. StudioCanal UK 45/47 Walkabout (1971) Another exceptional achievement in filmmaking from Nicolas Roeg that somehow failed to receive any Oscar nominations. 46/47 You Were Never Really Here (2018) Notch it down to bad timing, but Lynne Ramsay\u2019s You Were Never Really Here - starring Joaquin Phoenix - is a sensational piece of work worthy of reward. Amazon Studio 47/47 Zodiac (2007) Three years later, David Fincher would go head-to-head with The King Speech's Tom Hooper for The Social Network. In truth, serial killer drama Zodiac is every bit as good as the Facebook drama. Warner Bros Pictures 1/47 American Psycho (2000) Starring future Oscar-winner Christian Bale, Mary Harron\u2019s adaptation of the Bret Easton Ellis novel \u2013 in which the Vice star plays the psychopathic Patrick Bateman - didn\u2019t receive a single nomination.

Warner Bros Pictures\n\nThe biggest theory relating to Anakin's return predicts that the film's title could be referring to him and not Luke, as has been suspected, and that he will return as a Force ghost.\n\nBacking this idea up is new book The Secrets of the Jedi, which will be released in November. It confirms that Anakin \u2013 alongside Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi \u2013 returned a few times following his demise, and even trained others to become \u201cForce spirits\u201d after death.\n\nAn excerpt reads: \u201cTheir spirits guided me for many years but vanished when I shut myself off from the Force. It\u2019s a relief to feel their presence after all this time.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s not forget, Hayden Christensen \u2013 who played Anakin in the prequel trilogy \u2013 attended this year\u2019s Star Wars Celebration. Has the reveal been hiding in plain sight the whole time?\n\nInverse also points out that when Kevin Smith visited the set, he witnessed one Star Wars actor delivering \u201ca career best\u201d performance. Sure, this could mean Daisy Ridley or John Boyega, but Christensen received quite a bit of criticism for his previous performances \u2013 and his quote made it seem as if it was somebody more unexpected.\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] somebody I\u2019ve seen in these movies before,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI rolled a tear, it was so darn powerful.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Star Wars films \u2013 ranked worst to best 1/10 Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones (2002) The prequel trilogy has lived on in infamy, but the true low point of this low point in the Star Wars franchise must be Attack of the Clones, the dry, crusted middle of the cinematic sandwich. While Revenge of the Sith has some sense of completion and The Phantom Menace has some sense of wonder, all Attack of the Clones has is a CGI Yoda bopping about the screen like an unswattable fly while battling Christopher Lee\u2019s Count Dooku. It\u2019s a film driven by unnecessary desires: from the space politics, to Boba Fett\u2019s backstory, to Padm\u00e9 and Anakin\u2019s romance. The latter is the most insufferable, since George Lucas never had much of an ear for dialogue, as notoriously pointed out by Harrison Ford when he declared on set: \u201cGeorge, you can type this s***, but you sure as hell can\u2019t say it.\u201d Which leads us to one of the worst line readings in cinematic history, when Hayden Christensen\u2019s Anakin laments: \u201cI don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating \u2013 and it gets everywhere.\u201d Rex Features 2/10 Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith (2005) Hollywood has increasingly made the assumption that \u201cdarker\u201d means better when it comes to cinema \u2013 it explains why the Harry Potter films look like they were made while someone gradually turned down the dimmer switch on the studio lights. Of course, audiences know that \u201cdarker\u201d sometimes means that your protagonist-turned-villain becomes a \u201cyoungling\u201d-murdering, amateur street magician-looking sourpuss. Anakin\u2019s arc here comes to a whimper of an ending, underlined by the much-derided decision to have Darth Vader\u2019s first moments onscreen involve him howling \u201cNoooooo!\u201d up to the sky like a mournful hound. That said, Ewan McGregor confirms here that he managed to escape the franchise largely unscathed, as this instalment sees him have the most fun with the clunky dialogue (see: \u201cHello there!\u201d and \u201cI have the high ground!\u201d). Rex Features 3/10 Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) The Phantom Menace escapes slightly ahead of the rest of the prequel trilogy, if only for the fact it remembers these films are meant to be fun once in a while. The pod race \u2013 it\u2019s a good scene! Darth Maul is all looks, zero follow through \u2013 it\u2019s embarrassing to act like you\u2019ve won, only to be cut in half and sent hurtling down an exhaust pipe \u2013 but his inclusion in the film did introduce one of the best musical themes in Star Wars history, John Williams\u2019s \u201cDuel of the Fates\u201d. However, the space politics are a particular drag here, with all the talk of trade disputes, and, of course, it's obligatory to mention the terror that is Jar Jar Binks. Rex 4/10 Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018) Although it\u2019s the weakest of the new generation of Star Wars films, Solo still holds up as a fun romp worthy of Han Solo\u2019s rascal reputation. Alden Ehrenreich picks up on enough of Harrison Ford\u2019s mannerisms to sell the character without sliding into imitation, while Donald Glover is a scene stealer from the very moment he walks on screen as Lando Calrissian. It\u2019s a lost opportunity, then, that the film is otherwise slowed down by an impulse to offer backstory to as many aspects of Han\u2019s character as possible. Did we really need to know how we got the name \u201cSolo\u201d? Really? Rex Features 5/10 Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) There\u2019s a lot to wrap up in the concluding chapter of the original trilogy. The result is a few odd turns for the sake of plot convenience. What does one do with a character as enigmatic as Boba Fett? Why, have him topple into the Sarlacc pit within the first 20 minutes! How does one put to rest the love triangle hinted at in A New Hope? Why, insert a revelation that Luke and Leia are, in fact, brother and sister! Even the second Death Star oddly feels sillier than The Force Awakens and its third attempt at a giant ball in space, since The First Order at least had the excuse that their obsessive admiration of the Empire may have clouded their judgement. That said, there\u2019s still plenty of charm to be found here and the Ewoks aren\u2019t all that bad. Before you dismiss them as irritating merchandise opportunities, it\u2019s worth remembering that they have absolutely no qualms about killing and eating people. Rex Features 6/10 Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) If Rogue One is any indication of Disney\u2019s plans for the franchise and its future, then there\u2019s no cause for concern. The first of the \u201cA Star Wars Story\u201d spin-offs, it shifts into gear with ease, soothing audiences by not straying too far from the familiar timeline while introducing a full set of new characters and a grittier tone. Stylistically, it feels more like a Vietnam War movie and is proof of how far a gifted director like Gareth Edwards can stray from the franchise\u2019s usual formula and still feel grounded in the same world. Plus, you have to admire the guts it takes to deliver an ending like that\u2026 Rex Features 7/10 Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015) Disney made a very smart move with The Force Awakens. As the first Star Wars film of a new generation, it not only had to make its own mark, but feel familiar enough that it welcomed fans back with open arms. The balance is hit perfectly here. That\u2019s largely due to the film\u2019s new trio of central heroes, who radiate the same kind of warmth, bravery, and spirit that carved a special place in people\u2019s hearts when they were first introduced to the franchise\u2019s original stars. Daisy Ridley\u2019s Rey, John Boyega\u2019s Finn, and Oscar Isaac\u2019s Poe honour Star Wars's past while striding into its unknown future. It also helps that the film has landed on a villain like Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), whose drive and complexity may see him surpass even Darth Vader by the end of his story in Episode IX. Rex Features 8/10 Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017) Any divisiveness the film attracted certainly proved one thing: here\u2019s a Star Wars film that actually took a creative risk. And what a bold, ambitious, and ultimately beautiful risk that was. Director Rian Johnson took the cinematic legacy presented before him and added a new richness to its textures. He allowed heroism to go beyond the clean divide between good and evil; through Luke and Rey, we were taught not to be ashamed of our doubts but to grow stronger because of them. We were taught not to use destiny as a crutch, but to know when to forge our own paths. The Last Jedi is a soulful film told through some of the most striking cinematography of the entire franchise. Rex Features 9/10 Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) It\u2019s the place where it all began. The Star Wars franchise has only become the success it is today because of how purely revolutionary the first instalment was as a piece of Hollywood filmmaking. It is, to this day, one of the most successful examples of the modern epic, endlessly imitated but so rarely with the same heart or ambition. George Lucas tapped into one of the most timeless qualities of storytelling: its ability to let us see and understand our own world through the eyes of another. Star Wars has become so iconic because, even on such a grand scale, we know and relate to the emotions at hand \u2013 fear, love, or a desire to do what\u2019s right. Rex Features 10/10 Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) The Empire Strikes Back is remarkable in its ability to pursue real emotional stakes. Its closing moments, the final note to its symphony of sacrifice and tragedy, leaves us with the single, delicate emotion that is hope, blooming in the darkness as our heroes set out to save Han and restore the Rebel Alliance. What A New Hope built up by making us fall in love with these characters, The Empire Strikes Back recouped in sharing with us their pain and their fears. Darth Vader\u2019s reveal that he\u2019s Luke\u2019s father has, of course, found its place in history, but there\u2019s an equal sense of emotional resonance in the moment Leia and Han depart, moments before he\u2019s trapped in carbonite. When Leia\u2019s \u201cI love you\u201d is returned by Han\u2019s \u201cI know\u201d \u2013 a line written by Harrison Ford himself \u2013 we\u2019re reminded of how magical Star Wars\u2019s sense of storytelling can be, condensing everything that these two characters feel for each other into five simple words. Rex Features 1/10 Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones (2002) The prequel trilogy has lived on in infamy, but the true low point of this low point in the Star Wars franchise must be Attack of the Clones, the dry, crusted middle of the cinematic sandwich. While Revenge of the Sith has some sense of completion and The Phantom Menace has some sense of wonder, all Attack of the Clones has is a CGI Yoda bopping about the screen like an unswattable fly while battling Christopher Lee\u2019s Count Dooku. It\u2019s a film driven by unnecessary desires: from the space politics, to Boba Fett\u2019s backstory, to Padm\u00e9 and Anakin\u2019s romance. The latter is the most insufferable, since George Lucas never had much of an ear for dialogue, as notoriously pointed out by Harrison Ford when he declared on set: \u201cGeorge, you can type this s***, but you sure as hell can\u2019t say it.\u201d Which leads us to one of the worst line readings in cinematic history, when Hayden Christensen\u2019s Anakin laments: \u201cI don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating \u2013 and it gets everywhere.\u201d Rex Features 2/10 Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith (2005) Hollywood has increasingly made the assumption that \u201cdarker\u201d means better when it comes to cinema \u2013 it explains why the Harry Potter films look like they were made while someone gradually turned down the dimmer switch on the studio lights. Of course, audiences know that \u201cdarker\u201d sometimes means that your protagonist-turned-villain becomes a \u201cyoungling\u201d-murdering, amateur street magician-looking sourpuss. Anakin\u2019s arc here comes to a whimper of an ending, underlined by the much-derided decision to have Darth Vader\u2019s first moments onscreen involve him howling \u201cNoooooo!\u201d up to the sky like a mournful hound. That said, Ewan McGregor confirms here that he managed to escape the franchise largely unscathed, as this instalment sees him have the most fun with the clunky dialogue (see: \u201cHello there!\u201d and \u201cI have the high ground!\u201d). Rex Features 3/10 Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) The Phantom Menace escapes slightly ahead of the rest of the prequel trilogy, if only for the fact it remembers these films are meant to be fun once in a while. The pod race \u2013 it\u2019s a good scene! Darth Maul is all looks, zero follow through \u2013 it\u2019s embarrassing to act like you\u2019ve won, only to be cut in half and sent hurtling down an exhaust pipe \u2013 but his inclusion in the film did introduce one of the best musical themes in Star Wars history, John Williams\u2019s \u201cDuel of the Fates\u201d.
