On Wednesday, Iranian state television said Tehran will free seven crew members of the detained British-flagged tanker Stena Impero.\n\nEsper said he had not heard the news about the Stena Impero crew, but if they were going to be released that would be a positive thing. He reiterated that while the crisis with Iran was not over, it did seem to have stabilized.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Idrees Ali; Editing by Tom Brown and Bill Berkrot)", "description": "U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Wednesday he would limit his comments on talks between the United States and Taliban as negotiations were still ongoing \"in some ways,\" even as details of a draft deal have been \u00a0publicly announced by President Donald Trump and a senior U.S. diplomat", "authors": ["Idrees Ali"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/quZw4h8cLschckkgXEqmzg--~B/aD0zMDA7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/0fec4e649918b5d994a637e7c278ceee"}
