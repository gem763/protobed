It boasts it can use the data to 'build a highly personalised profile' that allows utility companies to execute 'highly targeted sales campaigns'.\n\nThe video has been removed from the company's website, but is still available on YouTube.\n\nOnzo says it was fully compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force last year.\n\nEDF Energy is working with British analytics company Onzo to link smart meters to Amazon's Alexa devices in 6,000 UK households\n\nChief executive Steven Daniels says the video was taken down because it no longer reflected the company's approach. He adds: 'We never receive any personal information about consumers. The data is never shared with third parties and is never shared with Amazon.'\n\nBut consumer expert Martyn James questions whether the firms involved can be trusted to act responsibly.\n\n'Companies such as Amazon have shown time and again that they can't be trusted with our private data,' he says. 'We need to step in with laws before it's too late.'\n\nThere are also concerns over whether vulnerable people have a genuine choice in the matter.\n\nOne firm has developed smart meter technology that allows landlords to monitor the efficiency of heating appliances in tenants' homes, as well as identifying mould and damp.\n\nSwitchee, the UK energy firm behind the project, says consent is sought from the tenant.\n\nMeanwhile, another firm has created a product that allows bosses to keep tabs on staff without their consent. In one instance, a bakery boss could tell that an employee hadn't turned up for work because an oven wasn't on when it should have been.\n\nValerie Lynch, chief executive of UK consultancy AND Technology Research, says it is only the billpayer who needs to consent to the data being shared.\n\nShe adds that the billpayer is 'the only person who sees the data' and it is fully compliant with GDPR.\n\nBut Silkie Carlo, director of civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, says: 'The idea we should consent to such data surveillance for commercial benefits puts a price on the privacy of our homes.'\n\nOne of the firms involved estimated that at least 10,000 households were taking part in one of the three government trials, with the overall figure likely to be much higher.\n\nIn return for the funding, the Government is able to collate data from the projects to use for its market research into the smart meter rollout.\n\nRobert Cheesewright, director of corporate affairs at Smart Energy GB, says: 'You will always be asked to consent to share any information wider than with your energy supplier.\n\nIf you do not want to share your meter readings and energy patterns, you don't have to do so.'\n\nA spokesperson for the Government's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy says: 'Smart meters will help households and small businesses cut their bills, but customers can be assured strict regulations are in place to give households firm control and peace of mind over who has access to their data.'\n\nAmazon declined to comment.\n\nm.dilworth@dailymail.co.uk", "description": "At least 20 companies are being given a share of \u00a320 million to develop products that can be used alongside smart meters in a government scheme to let tech firms access families' smart meter data.", "authors": ["Miles Dilworth For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
