Smart Metal Art comes from the acquisition of X Core\u2019s metal payment card business and associated patents. Smart Metal Art is designed for the dual interface mass affluent market and is already certified by Visa, Mastercard and Amex.\n\nIn a business environment with both online and offline offerings, metal payment cards have been massively adopted by users representing a booming market. A 2018 global consumer study indicated that more than 50% of consumers are willing to pay for a metal card, 70% of whom are under the age of 351. Fintech firms have nearly all adopted metal payment cards and major banks are also providing metal cards to their high net worth customers.\n\nTo satisfy this growing demand while still delivering the convenience customers expect, IDEMIA is investing to expand its leading offer of metal cards and launching Smart Metal Art suite of products. Smart Metal Art is the very first metal payment card fully suitable for contactless payments with no restrictions. It offers endless graphical possibilities thanks to its non-magnetic, decorated metal core, protected by layers that can be transparent or printed.\n\nSmart Metal Art includes patented technology, developed by US firm X Core and recently acquired by IDEMIA. These patents allow for perfect dual interface performance, as well as decoration capabilities, which are then encapsulated within protective layers. Smart Metal Art will be manufactured by IDEMIA in our Exton (Pennsylvania, USA) facility.\n\nAt a time when banks need to differentiate strongly from one another, this game-changing technology gives them free reign over their card designs while allowing them to use unrivaled graphics such as etching or a brushed look combined with high-definition coloring techniques on their metal cards.\n\nThanks to this proprietary technology, IDEMIA will enable even more financial institutions to distribute its latest-generation dual-interface metal payment cards to premium customers, in volume around the world. IDEMIA\u2019s end-to-end contactless metal card offer encompasses design, manufacture, personalization and product packaging.\n\nSmart Metal Art has been certified by Visa, Mastercard and Amex, with no restriction on contactless performance, giving IDEMIA\u2019s clients the opportunity of a very rapid go-to-market for their metal cards.\n\nAmanda Gourbault, Executive Vice-President for Financial Institutions activities at IDEMIA said: \u201cPayment cards are the latest marketing asset for banks for customer acquisition. Acquiring X Core is entirely consistent with IDEMIA\u2019s strategy to offer cutting-edge technology to its customers without ever compromising on security or convenience. Our new offer, Smart Metal Art, delivers the best high-end cards combined with unmatched contactless payment features, which will be a game changer for end-users.\u201d\n\nAbout IDEMIA\n\nIDEMIA, the global leader in Augmented Identity, provides a trusted environment enabling citizens and consumers alike to perform their daily critical activities (such as pay, connect and travel), in the physical as well as digital space.\n\nSecuring our identity has become mission critical in the world we live in today.
