But we are guilty of defending our people. We believe that the American people will be able to judge for themselves who the dangerous terrorists of this world are,\u201d the group added.\n\nThe PKK has been in armed conflict with Ankara for decades as part of an anti-Turkish insurgency to establish an independent Kurdish state. Turkey has accused the PKK and People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), which is fighting against Ankara in Syria and allied with the U.S. against ISIS, of being linked.\n\nThe letter comes amid a fragile five-day cease-fire in northeastern Syria that calls for Turkey to cease its military operations for 120 hours to allow Kurds in the area to withdraw from a designated safe zone along the Turkish and Syrian border.\n\nThe deal, brokered by Vice President Pence and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, was panned by critics who said the ceasefire essentially allows Turkey to continue its offensive after five days while forcing Kurds to retreat.\n\nReports have already emerged of fighting in the border region of Syria.\n\nTrump, who drew criticism that he greenlighted Turkey\u2019s offensive by withdrawing U.S. troops from northeastern Syria, sparked rebukes for his comments about the PKK, with former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice on Wednesday calling him a \u201ctotal sell-out.\u201d\n\nThe PKK suggested it did not deserve the criticism, arguing it is committed to human rights.\n\n\u201cThe PKK has never targeted the U.S. or any other country,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cWe have never shied away from the negotiating table to solve this conflict peacefully and politically. As a matter of fact, we have declared no less than eight ceasefires since 1993 to pave the way for negotiations. The PKK\u2019s political project is founded on basic human rights and liberties, gender liberation, religious pluralism and ecological rights.\u201d", "description": "The Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), which is designated as a terrorist group by both the U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/kurds_111215getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
