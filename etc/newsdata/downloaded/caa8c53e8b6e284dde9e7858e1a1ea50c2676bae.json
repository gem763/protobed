Silo everything related to impeachment under that one person. It\u2019s clear at this point that you can\u2019t have the chief of staff or anyone else running point on this.

Many of the top political operatives in Trump World have either joined the official reelection campaign, joined outside pro-Trump groups or are happily out of the fray with consulting gigs inside and outside of Washington.\n\nAnd not all of Trump\u2019s allies think the president would be well-served by adding to the White House political team.\n\nFormer White House counsel John Dowd said a new political strategist would only serve to complicate matters. Dowd said the White House counsel and Republican members of the House would act as an adequate firewall for Trump in his impeachment defense.\n\n\u201cI have never seen a corrupt abuse of congressional process cured by politics,\u201d Dowd said. \u201cThe president is very ably represented by counsel and ably supported in the House by the Minority Leader and his colleagues.\u201d\n\nStill, the past few days have revealed a host of new troubles for Trump on the impeachment front.\n\nA top diplomat to Ukraine told House investigators on Tuesday that he believed Trump withheld political aid to Ukraine in an effort to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump says he doesn't want NYT in the White House Warren to protest with striking Chicago teachers Schiff punches back after GOP censure resolution fails MORE.\n\nDemocrats described the testimony as the beginning of a \u201csea change\u201d in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, GOP lawmakers rebuked the president for referring to the impeachment inquiry as a \u201clynching.\u201d\n\nAnd Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellTrump urges GOP to fight for him Senate Dems signal they'll support domestic spending package Trump's top picks for Homeland Security chief are ineligible for job: reports MORE (R-Ky.) appeared to contradict Trump, who earlier this month said the GOP leader had told him the phone call with Zelensky was \u201cinnocent\u201d and \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have not had any conversations on this subject,\u201d McConnell said Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, Mulvaney has reportedly been feuding with White House counsel Pat Cipollone, who has been leading the administration\u2019s legal defense against impeachment.\n\nMulvaney has also spent the past several days cleaning up his admission that security aid for Ukraine had been dependent on the country conducting the investigation into Biden. Mulvaney has since denied that there was a quid pro quo.\n\nPolls show public opinion moving against the president in favor of impeachment, driven largely by Democrats and independents.\n\nStill, Trump\u2019s allies note that his support among Republicans appears to be holding strong.\n\nThey\u2019d just like to see a more coordinated and professional response to match Democrats, who have been sticking close to a \u201cfact sheet\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiOvernight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Partnership for America's Health Care Future \u2014 Four companies reach 0M settlement in opioid lawsuit | Deal opens door to larger settlements | House panel to consider vaping tax | Drug pricing markup tomorrow Schiff punches back after GOP censure resolution fails Trump urges GOP to fight for him MORE (D-Calif.) released this week detailing how she says Trump \u201cbetrayed his oath of office, betrayed our national security and betrayed the integrity of our elections for his own personal political gain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a full-time job,\u201d said the former White House official. \u201cThe chief of staff needs to focus on being chief of staff. If you don\u2019t want a war room, that\u2019s fine. But hire the chief strategist and just put everything under that person and take care of this.\u201d\n\nUpdated: 7:45 p.m.", "description": "Current and former administration officials are urging the White House to hire a new chief strategist as President Trump\u2019s allies grow frustrated with the administration\u2019s response to the House impeachment inquiry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_080719.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
