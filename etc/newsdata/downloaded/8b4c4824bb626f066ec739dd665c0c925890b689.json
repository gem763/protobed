In fact, it\u2019s a movement many would gladly forget altogether \u2013 on grounds of its apparent, political incorrectness.\n\nOrientalism, essentially, meant visions of the east by artists of the west. Numerous European painters, such as England\u2019s John Frederick Lewis, travelled to areas of the Near East, Middle East and North Africa and were left wide-eyed at the exoticism of what they saw: from the costumes and Islamic buildings to the desert landscape.\n\nAlthough hugely popular in the 19th-Century, Orientalist pictures have been distinctly unfashionable here for several decades now. The most telling criticism came from the Post-colonialist professor, Edward Said, in his 1978 book Orientalism, in which he argued depictions of the east were typically rooted in crude stereotypes and imperialism.\n\nCredit to the British Museum, then, for deciding the movement deserves a shot at reassessment \u2013 and devoting a new exhibition to it, Inspired by the East.\n\nThe story starts as far back as 1500 or so, as trade between Europe and its neigbours greatly expanded. Spices and silks were among the commodities that flooded into the West. There also grew a fondness for richly-decorated objects in ceramics and glass \u2013 so much so that Europeans soon started creating imitations of \u201cOriental\u201d originals. The exhibition includes a host of these, including a strikingly turquoise French bottle, inspired by 17th-Century pottery from Persia.", "description": "As art-world \u201cisms\u201d go, the 19th-Century movement of Orientalism is hardly up there with Impressionism, Cubism or Surrealism in public acclaim.", "authors": ["Alastair Smart", "Cal Revely-Calder", "Alastair Sooke"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/art/2019/10/07/TELEMMGLPICT000211462801-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqVHvAq_5QIWTEk1qjFG9oAFPPO_UTehhuPycLB8iDE8E.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
