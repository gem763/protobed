He was included on Cuba\u2019s 40-man preliminary roster for the Concacaf Gold Cup this past summer but did not make the final cut.\n\nDuring the Gold Cup, four Cuban players defected. Last year, 12 left the team during an under-20 tournament in Florida. Four years ago, several players went missing.\n\nThe last time the senior squad played in Washington, exactly 11 years ago for a World Cup qualifier, two players ran from the team hotel in Crystal City and did not return.\n\nSince 1999, more than 50 Cuban soccer players, most notably longtime MLS midfielder Osvaldo Alonso, have defected while on duty in the United States or Canada.\n\nRead more:\n\nOne Cuban soccer player is able to chase his pro dream in the U.S. \u2014 without defecting\n\nU.S. soccer kicks off Nations League, where matches are meaningful but competition is meh\n\nChristian Pulisic vows to \u2018keep pushing\u2019 with Chelsea as he returns to play with U.S. national team\n\nJozy Altidore will miss USMNT matches with injury", "description": "Yonaidis Garcia, a 22-year-old defender, left the delegation shortly after its arrival in Washington on Thursday, according to the news website ADN Cuba.", "authors": ["Steven Goff", "Reporter Covering Soccer", "D.C.
