Neither do we. Profitable investing often requires exceptional insight, luck, discipline, and experience. Most first-rate traders had lost money for weeks, months, or even years before they finally turned in profits. That\u2019s one way to look at it - sometimes you have to lose some to learn how to make some. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be like this.\n\nIt\u2019s a fact that the quickest way to learn something is by doing. However, you can\u2019t just blindly jump into the fire without getting burned. That\u2019s where a strategy comes in.\n\nHaving a strategy means combining some theory with your market analysis and putting it into practice. It is a powerful combination, especially if you know what you\u2019re doing. Unfortunately, most beginning investors think they do, only to learn that they don\u2019t.\n\nThat\u2019s why a smart way to approach investing is by having someone to coach you. Having a mentor, a friend, a coach, or anyone else with the relevant experience can streamline your learning process without burning your portfolio via expensive trial and error experiments.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s easier said than done. Great mentors or coaches typically cost sums of money that aren\u2019t available in just anyone\u2019s pockets. Not every retail investor can afford a great investing coach.\n\nDespite that, having someone to discuss the market and your decisions is still an invaluable experience - you have to surround yourself with people who can challenge your perceptions. As billionaire investor and hedge fund manager Ray Dalio puts it:\n\n\u201cI just want to be right\u2014I don\u2019t care if the right answer comes from me.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why one of the best places to kickstart your crypto investing career is a social trading platform which allows you to invest in cryptocurrencies. In this article, we review some of the best crypto social trading platforms in the market.\n\nBut first, what is crypto social trading?\n\nWhat is crypto social trading?\n\nSocial trading platforms are like social networks for traders. In most cases, they act as a broker and allow you to purchase various assets, CFDs, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies.\n\nUnlike regular trading platforms, social trading platforms let you connect with other traders trading the same markets or goods, copy their actions, share and discuss analyses and predictions, ask questions, grow your following and learn faster than you typically would.\n\nHere, crypto social trading refers to social trading platforms which allow their clients to trade cryptocurrencies or crypto-based asset contracts.\n\nSo, which social trading platforms are the best for cryptocurrency enthusiasts in 2019?\n\nBest crypto social trading platforms in 2019\n\nExchange Leverage Cryptocurrencies Fees Link eToro 2x 15 0.75% - 2.9% Trade Now ZuluTrade Varies per broker 5 Varies Trade Now Naga Trader 30x 8 Varies Trade Now Tradeo 100x 5 2.1 to 8+ pips Trade Now Covesting 1x 31 0.15% - 18% Trade Now\n\n1. eToro\n\nPros Cons Excellent social trading experience Inactivity fees Wide variety of instruments No crypto deposits Reputable, regulated company Customer support can be slow at times\n\neToro is a multi-asset social trading platform which is a pioneer of social trading.

Even the experts get things wrong.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re willing to risk, you should expect some loses for the sake of learning. If you want to set off the right foot, starting to trade on a social trading crypto platform is an excellent starting point, especially if you are aware of the risks.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/guides/0//", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
