Boris Roessler/Pool via REUTERS\n\nPARIS (Reuters) - Christine Lagarde, the incoming president of the European Central Bank, said on Wednesday euro zone countries with large budget surpluses should invest more to boost economic growth.\n\nIn an interview with France\u2019s RTL broadcaster days before she takes up her post, Lagarde singled out Germany and the Netherlands as countries that could deploy their surpluses to help growth.\n\n\u201cCountries, in particular those with the budget space, have not really made the necessary efforts, and I\u2019m thinking obviously of countries that are in persistent budget surplus right now, the Netherlands, Germany and a certain number of others in the world,\u201d Lagarde said.\n\n\u201cThose that have the room for manoeuvre, those that have a budget surplus, that\u2019s to say Germany, the Netherlands, why not use that budget surplus and invest in infra-structure? ... Why not invest in education, why not invest in innovation, to allow for a better re-balancing?\u201d\n\nThere is disagreement within the euro zone, reflected inside the ECB, over how best to revive economic growth, which is still sluggish a decade after the global financial crisis, while other major economies have bounced back.\n\nSome in the euro zone favour a conservative approach, relying primarily on the current monetary policy. Others, including Lagarde\u2019s native France, believe an increase in investment is the answer.", "description": "Christine Lagarde, the incoming president of the European Central Bank, said on Wednesday euro zone countries with large budget surpluses should invest more to boost economic growth.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446442433&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0E4", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
