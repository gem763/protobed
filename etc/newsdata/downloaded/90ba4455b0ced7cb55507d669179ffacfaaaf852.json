It reported a mixed third quarter on Tuesday, but its shares rose almost 7% on the day.\n\nZebra makes bar-code scanners, printers and other mobile computing products for businesses. Cramer noted that he has been a long-time fan of the company.\n\nZebra Technologies' decision to move its supply chain out of China was in response to President Donald Trump's long-running trade war with the country. Trump has called for companies to move manufacturing elsewhere, including to the U.S., in order to avoid tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\nTrump said earlier this month that the U.S. and China agreed to a preliminary \"phase one deal\" as the countries try to end the trade war. While nothing has been signed, officials have said they were \"close to finalizing\" the agreement.\n\nIf a deal isn't reached by Dec. 15, that round of tariffs will still likely go into effect, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC earlier this month.\n\nWhen asked by Cramer if Zebra was concerned about the quality of its products that had been moved, Gustafsson said he was not. He said the company is working with established partners as it moves to new factories.\n\n\"They're going into existing facilities, so we think the start-up issue should be minimal,\" he said.", "description": "\"They're going into existing facilities, so we think the start-up issue should be minimal,\" CEO Anders Gustafsson says.", "authors": ["Kevin Stankiewicz"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105883543-1565728036136anders.jpg?v=1572382843", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
