Did we stand on the sidelines and say nothing? Did we play games?,\u201d the veteran activist challenged.\n\nOn another occasion, during tough talks on the need to bring down out-of-control drug prices, Cummings engaged directly with Trump and reminded the heartless president of the debt that the two of them \u2013 as elderly leaders \u2013 owed to future generations.\n\nRecounting a private conversation he had with Trump on the subject, Cummings said he had told the president that he (Trump) was in his seventies and he was in his late sixties, adding: \u201cVery soon you and I will be dancing with the angels. The thing you and I need to figure out is what we can do \u2013 what present can we bring to generations unborn?\u201d\n\nAs the tributes poured in this past week, those who knew him in politics, in the civil rights movement, in the church and in ordinary life kept repeating the same refrain about how he would say \u201cwe can do better than this\u201d, \u201cwe should be better than this\u201d and \u201cwe are better than this\u201d.\n\nFriends and foes alike recounted instances in which, when an argument was reaching a deadlock and the heat was high, Cummings would chide and coerce everyone involved to \u201cbe better\u201d.\n\nEven when Trump insulted his Baltimore constituency as \u201ca rat-infested\u201d neighbourhood, Cummings refused to take the bait and stoop to his level.\n\nGoing against the urgings of his constituents and everyone else who was disgusted at Trump\u2019s dig, Cummings soared high and rather expressed sympathy for Trump\u2019s lack of empathy for his own citizens, who were living in appalling conditions as a result of government failures.\n\nInstead, he told the people of Baltimore to ignore the insults because they were \u201cbetter\u201d.\n\nOne of the most memorable and touching moments which will immortalise the man was his sympathetic treatment of Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, who had thrown away his moral compass in the service of his wealthy client.\n\nConvicted of fraud and facing a prison sentence, rudely and heartlessly rebuked by Trump and senior Republicans, Cohen was a lonely and broken man when he appeared before a congressional committee to tell the truth and take personal responsibility for what he had done for Trump.\n\nCummings, who was chairing the committee, chose to show the disgraced lawyer the importance of his remorse and belated honesty, and assured him that even though he would be suffering the consequences of his actions \u2013 including going to jail \u2013 this episode would hopefully produce a better Cohen, a better Trump, a better America and a better world. Better.\n\nSo passionate was he about people being their better selves that even though he was regarded as one of the most militant Democrats on Capitol Hill, he was one of the few people there who reached out across the aisle to create common ground with Republicans he had nothing in common with.\n\nSo much so that one of his best friends in Congress was arch-conservative Republican Mark Meadows.\n\nCummings was no naive idealist who just believed that things would be better because people professed they would be.\n\nHe worked for it. He took physical, mental and emotional strain in his lifelong fight for the betterment of humanity.\n\nElements of the DA want the party to be an instrument for entrenching racial divides instead of being a progressive force in society.\n\nHow we could do with a Cummings in this country right now.\n\nWith the levels of toxicity so high, it has become anathema for anyone to try to rise above the cursing and yelling.\n\nThe governing ANC, once the leader of society, is embroiled in its own destructive wars that make it impossible for any of its leaders to lead.\n\nIts president, who also happens to be the head of state, is being taken less and less seriously as a leader with each passing day.\n\nHe has ceded ground to venomous pythons who want to turn the clock back on the nation-building project.\n\nElements of the DA want the party to be an instrument for entrenching racial divides instead of being a progressive force in society.\n\nThis plays nicely into the hands of the venomous pythons in the governing party, whose work would be made so much easier by a DA that had taken a triple dose of Khanyi Mbau\u2019s skin-lightening medication.\n\nREAD: Editorial: The DA\u2019s puzzling cul-de-sac\n\n\n\nThe EFF is something else. The party that seemed to be maturing into a militant but intellectually astute formation has elected to be the prime dispenser of the toxic gases that pollute our political atmosphere.\n\nIt has convinced itself that in order for it to maintain its steady growth, South Africa needs to be an angry and hateful place.\n\nOn the far right, the Freedom Front Plus is capitalising well on the toxicity and benefiting from misplaced white fear and anxiety.\n\nIn society there is growing despair, feelings of marginalisation and resentment of the other.\n\nWhile the clergy has been willing to show leadership, the political sphere has been content to keep fanning the fires.\n\nIt is in times like these that we need a Cummings-like figure to emerge and tell us to be our better selves.", "description": "What stood out among the many tributes to legendary congressperson Elijah Cummings, who died this week, was the impact he made beyond the legislative corridors of Washington.
