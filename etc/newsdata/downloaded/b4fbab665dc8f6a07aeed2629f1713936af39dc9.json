Prices had firmed 0.5% last week on fears of cooling global growth.\n\nU.S. gold futures were little changed at $1,513.30 per ounce.\n\nThere is uncertainty regarding the trade negotiations. China seems to be very reluctant to agree, said Margaret Yang Yan, a market analyst at CMC Markets. \u201cThere is demand for safe haven assets, which reflects a very cautious mood towards the trade deal.\u201d\n\nThe next round of U.S-China trade negotiations are slated to be held in Washington on Oct. 10-11, though hopes of progress diminished after Bloomberg reported that Chinese officials wanted the scope of this week\u2019s negotiations to be narrow.\n\n\u201cGold has been in a range of less than $100. It will take a strong catalyst to bring gold out of this channel,\u201d Yan said, adding that quantitative easing by the Fed, European Central Bank and Bank of Japan could be a major factor.\n\nA report on Friday showed jobs growth in the United States slowed in September and wage growth stalled, even as unemployment dropped to a 50-year low.\n\nBut that did little to change market expectations that the Fed will cut likely interest rates at its next policy review on Oct. 29-30 to support the economy. Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold.\n\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s foreign exchange reserves fell more than expected in September amid a cooling domestic economy and the rising trade tensions.\n\nAmong other metals, platinum rose 0.3% to $878.75, silver dipped 0.1% to $17.53 and palladium dropped slightly to $1,663.69.", "description": "Gold prices edged higher on Monday as investors were cautious ahead of this week's Sino-U.S. trade talks following a report that Beijing would likely disagree to a broad trade deal with the United States.", "authors": ["Karthika Suresh Namboothiri", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437917804&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9601E", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
