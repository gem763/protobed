Ankara gains intelligence, influences policy, and affects operations. Moreover, the U.S. is believed to store some 50 nuclear bombs at Incirlik Airbase. Any attempt to wreck the Turkish economy, or worse, retaliate militarily for Turkish activity in Syria, would force Erdogan to respond\u2014if only to preserve his nationalist credentials. His government could attempt to seize these weapons, which would also advance his ambitions to make Ankara a nuclear power.\n\nInstead of denouncing and punishing Ankara, the Americans and Europeans should address the more fundamental problem of Turkey\u2019s NATO membership. When the alliance was being negotiated, Canadian and American officials supported creating a process to address precisely this problem: a member whose government shifts away from democratic values. But, as reports historian Tim Sayle, the British and French opposed the idea, and so it was dropped. When asked about the possibility, Senator Arthur Vandenberg observed: \u201cUnder such circumstances the pact simply ceases to be operative in respect to them.\u201d\n\nHowever, that isn\u2019t working with Turkey. Washington is imposing economic sanctions on and threatening war with a fellow member, while a half dozen European nations have suspended arms sales. This dissension undermines the alliance\u2019s battle-worthiness. Now is the time to revive the expulsion proposal.", "description": "", "authors": ["Doug Bandow", "Theamericanconservative.Com Articles Instead-Of-Warmongering-Trump-Should-Throw-Turkey-Out-Of-Nato"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
