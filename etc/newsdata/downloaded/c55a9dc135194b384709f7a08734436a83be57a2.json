I think that's definitely the most important thing. We're very happy,\" he insisted to Mail Online.\n\n\"Regardless of how many people [there are] in every one of our lives, there will be opinions. And everyone can have their own opinion.\"\n\n(Image: Beretta/Sims/REX)\n\nIndia also hit back at the cheating claims, adding: \"We've had a week of nightmare things. There was one [rumour] last week and then yesterday there was another. Can we have a break? Can we just live, please?\n\n\"We've been absolutely fine, but obviously it's not nice. The worst thing is \u2013 something coming out in the paper is one thing, we know it's not true and we can just get over that \u2013 but it's all the people on Instagram that start sending you horrible messages.\"\n\nShe added that Kieran and his brother were family friends and she had known them both for years.\n\n\"It was their 30th birthday so I was there with loads of friends and family. There's nothing about it! It got blown into a ridiculous thing,\" she said.", "description": "Ovie Soko and India Reynolds are said to be 'on the rocks' three months after the end of Love Island", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Wp Pix", "Splashnews.Com", "Getty Images", "Beretta Sims Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20158168.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/4_The-TV-Choice-Awards-2019-Red-Carpet-Arrivals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
