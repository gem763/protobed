Selecting small portions may provide a means of doing so and this may be why the social facilitation of eating is less pronounced amongst groups of strangers.\n\n'Findings from previous research suggest that we often choose what (and how much) to eat based on the type of impression that we want to convey about ourselves.\n\n'Evidence suggests that this may be particularly pronounced for women eating with men they wish to impress and for people with obesity who wish to avoid being judged for overeating.'\n\nPeople in ancient civilisations, the University of Birmingham researchers said, would share food while it was plentiful in a bid to avoid going hungry when they ran low (stock image)\n\nDr Ruddock and her colleagues analysed 42 other studies which had looked at the effects of socialising while eating.\n\nThey found people tended to eat 48 per cent more when they were with people they liked. This effect was slightly lower for obese women, who ate 29 per cent more.\n\nWhen people were with strangers or those they didn't like, however, the effect was not the same.\n\nAnd humans aren't alone in their tendency to gobble more when in groups.\n\nThe same trait has been seen in animals including rats, chickens, gerbils and other species.\n\nThis suggested, the researchers said, that it serves a purpose beyond simple vanity.\n\nBecause food gathering is essentially a competition in the wild, those who hoard it for themselves could fall out of favour with the rest of the group, so it could be a way of keeping tensions low.\n\nDr Ruddock added: 'A solution to this tension may be to eat at least as much as others in the group.\n\n'Individual members match their behaviour to others, promoting a larger meal than might otherwise be eaten in the absence of this social competition.\n\n'What we describe as \"social facilitation\" can be seen as a natural by-product of social food sharing \u2013 a strategy that would have served a critical function in our ancestral environments.\n\n'This also explains why it is more likely to occur in groups with individuals who are familiar with each other.'\n\nAnd in people, social norms might play a part, too.\n\nIt may be seen as more acceptable for people to gorge themselves in a social situation than when they're at home alone, the scientists said.", "description": "Researchers from the University of Birmingham found people ate around 48 per cent more and it could be because ancient civilisations would share food while it was plentiful to reduce hunger.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/17/19304784-0-image-a-41_1570205286721.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
