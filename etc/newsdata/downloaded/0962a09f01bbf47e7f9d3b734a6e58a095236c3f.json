Taxpayers are left to foot the bill.\u201d\n\nAB5 demands that workers be considered employees unless companies can prove the worker is \u201cfree from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work\u201d.\n\nCritics of gig economy firms say app-based work - which assigns jobs and attaches a rate of pay - mean workers are not \u201cfree from control\u201d. The companies, however, argue that because workers can determine when they work, where they work and for how long, they are \u201cfree\u201d.\n\nAB5 will force Uber and other firms like it to go through what\u2019s known as the ABC test, which assesses the question of whether or not companies can consider their workers contractors rather than employees.\n\n\u201cJust because the test is hard doesn\u2019t mean that we will not be able to pass it,\u201d said Tony West, Uber\u2019s top lawyer, on Wednesday.\n\nLimiting flexibilty\n\nThe firm\u2019s confidence will likely be tested when AB5 comes into force on 1 January 2020. Under the law, cities in California can sue Uber (or other gig-economy firms) directly if they feel the firm is not complying - previously it was up to individual drivers.\n\nAnalysts have predicted devastating consequences for gig economy firms\u2019 bottom line if they are forced to reclassify workers into employees. When asked, Uber would not offer any guidance to investors over how damaging such a change would be. The firm lost just over $5.2bn in its last reported quarter. Lyft, valued at $15bn, lost $2.3bn in the same period.\n\nThe companies warned they would look to implement more traditional work patterns.\n\n\u201cFlexibility of drivers would be limited,\u201d Uber\u2019s Mr West said.\n\n\u201cDrivers would not be able to choose to sign on when they wanted. Not only would they have to work shifts, they would be deployed to areas, rather than choosing where to pick up a fare.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cBased on what drivers tell us, they are not changes they would welcome.\u201d\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Uber drivers in Nairobi explain why they are going on strike\n\nInstead, Uber - along with Lyft - has proposed drafting alternative legislation as a compromise. It would guarantee a minimum wage of $21 per hour, and offer the chance for sectoral collective bargaining, allowing workers across the rideshare industry to band together in negotiations.\n\nThe compromise, yet to be drafted, does not look likely to sway California\u2019s lawmakers.\n\n\u201cBillionaires who say they can\u2019t pay minimum wages to their workers say they will spend tens of millions to avoid labour laws,\u201d Ms Gonzalez wrote on Twitter last week.\n\n\u201cJust pay your damn workers!\u201d she added.\n\n_____\n\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC\n\nDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?
