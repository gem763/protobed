REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\nThe 23-year-old Australian is looking to cap a remarkable year that has seen her win the French Open and climb into pole position in the rankings with victory at the tournament that brings together the eight best ranked players of 2019.\n\nShe begins her quest for the title at the $14 million event against Switzerland\u2019s Belinda Bencic on Sunday in the group phase of the competition at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Center, the tournament\u2019s home for the next 10 years after spending the previous five editions in Singapore.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there ever is a favourite,\u201d said Barty.\n\n\u201cI think everyone is deserving to win that\u2019s in the draw. Everyone has earned their place here and has the right to try to do the best they can to try and win.\n\n\u201cOn any given day, anyone can be beaten. That\u2019s the beauty of sport, there are no certainties. There\u2019s always an opportunity for someone to try and bring their best. I think that\u2019s the best thing about sport, there are no certainties.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an exciting week. We\u2019ve all played well throughout the whole year to try to get here. Now it\u2019s about trying to bring our best this week, if we can.\u201d\n\nBarty will be meeting Bencic, the number seven seed, for the first time in her career after being drawn in the Red Group also containing Naomi Osaka and Petra Kvitova, with the top two in the round robin group phase advancing to Saturday\u2019s semi-finals.\n\nWorld No. 2 Karolina Pliskova headlines the Purple Group and starts her tournament against defending champion Elina Svitolina from Ukraine on Monday evening, with Bianca Andreescu taking on Simona Halep later the same day.\n\nThis will be Barty\u2019s first appearance in the singles event having previously played in the doubles and she is relishing the opportunity to face off against the elite of the women\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible group of players, I think,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very special being here in singles, having had a bit of a taste it in the doubles the last two years. It was really nice.\n\n\u201cI think the goal for all singles players is to make the finals at the end of the year, to be playing against the best of the best to test yourself against the best. Really excited to have an opportunity now after a fantastic year to try and finish really well.\u201d", "description": "Ash Barty does not see her status as the world's top ranked player as a reason to be installed as favourite to win this week's WTA Finals as the season-ending jamboree makes its debut in China.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445100853&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P04L", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
