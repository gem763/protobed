Now it\u2019s 2019 and a costume that doesn\u2019t nod at the pop cultural touchstones of the previous nine months is no costume at all.\n\nNowhere does time move as fast as it does online, so some of these incidents that previously seemed unforgettable may have slipped down the back of the mental sofa.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nSo peruse our guide to creating an of-the-moment, minimum fuss, maximum impact costume that will attract the most precious currency of all: that sweet cultural capital.\n\nWagatha Christie\n\nDespite being an incident that took place solely in the digital sphere (much like our lives in 2019), it\u2019s relatively easy to depict the feat of investigative journalism that was Coleen Rooney exposing Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account as a tabloid mole via the magic of costume.\n\nThat\u2019s thanks to the nickname \u201cWagatha Christie\u201d, bestowed upon Rooney by the internet, which instantly makes translating the concept of an elongated ellipsis (\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account\u201d) into child\u2019s play.\n\nAll that\u2019s required to bring to life \u201cMurder on the Leyton Orient Express\u201d is a smartphone, a magnifying glass, a taupe trench coat and an extremely sleek blow dry.\n\nEvian Guy\n\nEvian Guy, aka Andy King, aka the man who went to the Bahamian customs office \u201cfully prepared to suck d***\u201d in order to release supplies for the doomed Fyre Festival, is a costume that requires a few key, but easily attainable elements.\n\nA short grey wig is good; a fleece and shirt combo even better. But most important is, of course, Evian. King himself did not have Evian \u2013 hence the preparation to fellate a customs officer \u2013 but without the Evian, the get-up is just that of a slightly bemused middle-aged man. Which works better as a Brexit costume.\n\nNatalie and Caroline\n\nHow do you dress as a viral essay, you might ask? This is a couples/friends costume that pays homage to the saga of Instagram influencer Caroline Calloway and her sort-of ghostwriter and former friend, Natalie Beach.\n\nCaroline had already achieved online notoriety in certain sections of the internet in early 2019, thanks to a meet-and-greet event that was either a scam or a horribly organised enterprise, depending on who you ask.\n\nNatalie came to public attention when she published an essay about her experience of one-time friendship with Caroline \u2013 and helping to write her book proposal.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed to realise this vision is two wigs; one blonde, one brunette. And a heady miasma of resentment. But also mason jars, a potentially copyright-infringing Matisse print and \u2013 the crucial element \u2013 some Yale plates. Mislay these at some point to be truly method.\n\nSimone Biles winning everything\n\nOctober saw Simone Biles officially crowned the greatest gymnast in history. So talented is she that there are currently three different gymnastics moves named after her and the International Gymnastics Federation are trying to water down the points value of her skills \u2013 because no other gymnast can match her.\n\nDon a leotard and scrape hair into a tight bun for the basic Biles look. But what makes this look is the medals. As many as possible. Attach ribbon to large chocolate coins for accessories that double as snacks.\n\nHot Priest\n\nNo one will come close to emitting the pure carnal energy Andrew Scott\u2019s portrayal of the priest in season two of Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s Fleabag brought to screens in 2019. But many will try.\n\nTo pull off the costume (rumpled black trousers and shirt, white piece of paper tucked around the neck for a dog collar) and elevate it from merely \u201cpriest\u201d into \u201chot priest\u201d, add a can of M&S Gin and Tonic and a half-smoked cigarette. Utter the word \u201ckneel\u201d in a sultry, commanding tone intermittently, but never directly to anyone specifically because sexual harassment is not sexy. A Bible can also be added to stay in the go(o)d books.\n\nMegan Rapinoe on the Women\u2019s World Cup Victory Parade\n\nThe Women\u2019s World Cup felt like a landmark occasion for myriad reasons, not least that women\u2019s football finally grabbed \u2013 and kept \u2013 the attention of a record number of people.\n\nWhile many players were cemented in the history books during the tournament, it was American winger Megan Rapinoe who became global name.\n\nNot only did Rapinoe take the Golden Boot and Golden Ball for being both top scorer and best player at the tournament, as co-captain, she also led her team to overall victory in the games.\n\nAll this while speaking out against what she perceived as unfair persecution of minorities in America, leading her into a public spat with President Trump.\n\nChannel the World Cup winning energy of Rapinoe at the team\u2019s New York victory parade by donning a black T-shirt and leggings and a thin gold chain around the neck. Accessories make this look, specifically: oversized chunky red sunglasses, a bottle of champagne and one Fifa World Cup trophy. Fakes acceptable. Bonus item: confetti, made from shredded sex discrimination lawsuits demanding equal pay. If one of these is not on hand, normal paper will suffice \u2013 just about.\n\nMr Broccoli\n\nIt\u2019s hard to represent a social movement with good intentions and a strong message, ruined by overzealous drama students. The best way is probably via Mr Broccoli.\n\nMr Broccoli, for the uninitiated, is a member of Animal Rebellion, an Extinction Rebellion offshoot. He\u2019s actually a 46-year-old carpenter but chooses to make his serious point about the ongoing climate emergency by dressing up as a large vegetable who pretends to take phone calls from a banana. Great, meaningful stuff.\n\nMr Broccoli is a risky costume choice. Being daubed entirely in green paint, with broccoli as headgear is a shortcut to losing friends and alienating people but hey, commitment to the bit is everything. Also be wary of actually being mistaken for the real Mr Broccoli (is there a real Mr Broccoli? Or is he played by a series of sleeper agents?) and heavily lampooned.\n\nPhoebe Waller Bridge at the Emmys\n\nFleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge cleaned up at the 2019 Emmy Awards, snagging four trophies, including Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, Writing for a Comedy Series and Outstanding Comedy Series.\n\nSo she had reason to celebrate \u2013 which is why her friend Josh Cole managed to snap an iconic photo of the star.\n\nSurrounded by her trophies, PJW was pictured reclining on a Chauteau Marmont sunlounger in her Monique Lhuillier dress; margarita in one hand a cigarette in the other. The snap went viral within 24 hours (how could it not?).\n\nThe only difficult aspect of this costume is obtaining fake Emmy statuettes, which are harder to track down than their Oscar counterparts. Some compromise might be required here; a swap for a generic trophy perhaps, or a Dundie if you want to pay homage to two pop culture giants at a time.\n\nBut the other elements to turn someone into PWB are easy; any blush coloured dress with a plunging neckline, a cigarette (fake, if preferred but do not swap for a vape, it will not work. Vapes do not channel the requisite BDE to pull off this look) and a margarita. Pair up with a Hot Priest for meta satisfaction.\n\nThe World Record Egg\n\nRemember the egg? Come on, the egg. Oval, smooth, brown? The most-liked post ever on Instagram? That beat Kylie Jenner\u2019s previous record (which was the first photo of her daughter, Stormi)?\n\nFor this one, simply procure an egg costume. That\u2019s it. If anyone wants to really commit, strip off the egg costume at some point to reveal three advertising professionals who claim to reject corporate culture, then partner with streaming service Hulu for an undisclosed amount of money.\n\n30-50 Feral Hogs\n\nThe summer of 2019 was particularly unrelenting as far as a constant stream of news goes, but surely everyone can recall where they were on 4 August, when 30-50 feral hogs burst into the collective consciousness within three to five minutes.\n\nApparently hogs are a legitimate problem in parts of the American south but the tweet that introduced the concept of these feral piggies \u2013 penned by user William McNabb in response to a question on gun control \u2013 inspired levity across the globe at the time.\n\nTo nail the \u201cpig\u201d aspect, all that\u2019s needed is a snout, pig ears and a tail. But these are feral hogs.\n\nA deranged air must be conveyed. Get white-out contact lenses, smear fake dirt around the mouth, perhaps hang children\u2019s toys (or a doll!) from clothing. Anything to indicate you\u2019re hogwild and also capable of running through a yard within three to five minutes.\n\nThe ultimate group costume.", "description": "Halloween,\u00a0that wonderful time of year when the populace celebrates a Celtic festival by paying homage to...\u00a0the biggest memes of the year.\u00a0 Gone are the days when dressing up as a mummy was regarded as properly entering the spirit of the 31 October.
