And in the spacious rooms, yukata (heavy cotton robes) and handwoven baskets are supplied for wearing to the onsen, just as residents have done for centuries.\n\nIt\u2019s likely, though, that Beppu\u2019s residents have never experienced an onsen as modern or majestic as the hotel\u2019s. The onsen, which also includes a pool jutting out into the valley, is the hotel\u2019s crown jewel, the reason why an international brand is banking on such a grand property in a remote location. There are a variety of springs: some are set into the mountain among shrubbery, while one of the indoor options is a lie-down pool for balmy reveries. There\u2019s also a steam room, sauna and a superlative day spa, where the 60-minute reflexology foot massage is a must.\n\nThe hotel is the first hot springs resort in the ANA InterContinental portfolio.\n\nMen and women typically bathe naked in separate facilities, which is the case here. There are other rules around bathing, including that you must shower before getting into the water, but the abundant staff speak excellent English \u2013 a boon in regional Japan \u2013 and are happy to advise.\n\nFor those not up to taking their clothes off in front of strangers, 11 club rooms and 10 suites come with a private onsen on their terraces. These Japanese-style stone tubs are designed for soaking up to your shoulders. (Also in this tier is access to the club, which offers a very English afternoon tea with scones and cream.)\n\nThe still mostly Japanese guests tend to follow a routine: the hot springs are popular before breakfast and after dinner. Evening is a special time at the onsen. Plunging in as the steam rises and night falls, then climbing out to feel the breeze drift through the rock garden onto my newly soft skin is a memory I will cherish.\n\nBut what to do in between baths?\n\nAtelier, pictured, is a dinner-only restaurant option serving international cuisine to complement the all-day, Japanese-inspired menu at Elements.\n\nYou could start by eating. Bathing is, after all, thought to stimulate the appetite. The on-site restaurant, Elements, is run by an Australian chef, Justin Parker. Breakfast features both Japanese options (miso cod, tofu skin) and imaginative Western ones (mango compote with chilli and cardamom on yoghurt from the Oita prefecture was my go-to). Come dinner there is a choice of a buffet or tasting menu.\n\nParker\u2019s six-course degustation reflects what he describes as the \u201cextreme seasonality\u201d of Japanese cuisine, with an infusion of Gallic flair. A tomato consomm\u00e9 uses Oita tomatoes, and the extra-rare Wagyu is from nearby Yufu. Afterwards, Licky Tetoka, a genial mixologist originally from Tahiti, whips up an Old-Fashioned with cypress-infused bitters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDay trips to visit ceramicists and other craftsmen are planned, but had not been finalised when I stayed. And although forest bathing \u2013 the Japanese practice of walking mindfully through trees \u2013 should theoretically be an option, the surrounding hills don\u2019t yet have much in the way of paths and the surrounding roads are too busy for sauntering.\n\nBeppu is picturesque and the hotel can arrange restaurant reservations and transport there, including for jikokumushi, a type of cooking where seafood and vegetables are steamed using sulfurous water. It\u2019s a DIY affair, using industrial-style cookers. While the food bathes in nutrient-rich water, diners can do the same: below the long wooden dining tables are warm and shallow springs in which to rest your feet.\n\nAlso notable in Beppu, which has plenty of small temples and charming cafes for a morning\u2019s stroll, is Japan\u2019s only public foot bath, located in an ancient stone pagoda. It\u2019s quite a sight to see visitors of all ages dip their toes in the steaming waters, and it encapsulates much of what makes onsen culture and Japan itself so special: communality, courtesy and, above all, a commitment to the inextricable connection between mind and body, realised here long before the West discovered wellness.\n\nA private onsen room at the hotel.

Rooms from $800\n\nDon\u2019t miss Japan\u2019s only communal foot bath and jikokumushi (or steamed cooking) at Enma, a self-service lunch establishment.\n\nGetting there Oita is a 90-minute flight from Tokyo or 60 minutes from Osaka, and the resort is a further 50 minutes by car. Or you can fly to Fukuoka Airport and take a two-hour train trip to Beppu. The landscape you\u2019ll pass is pretty \u2013 rice fields and small villages \u2013 and eating a meticulously assembled bento on the Shinkansen is great fun.\n\nThermal attractions\n\nThere are onsen throughout Japan, thanks to its location, wedged between four major tectonic plates. But Beppu claims the greatest variety of mineral-rich waters, each of which has particular benefits. The city\u2019s springs were the first to be designated a \u201ccultural treasure\u201d by the national government, and not surprisingly, mineral bath salts from Beppu are a hot commodity.\n\nThe ANA InterContinental expects visitor numbers to peak in August (late summer) and December (winter), although onsen are a year-round attraction for the country\u2019s citizens. In July to August, guests can sit out until late in the evening as the chirping of cicadas echoes through the forest. Winter has its own charms, including the magical vista of snow-clad hinoki trees.\n\nWhile Beppu is in the south of Japan, another renowned hot springs destination is in the far north, in Hokkaido prefecture. This is Noboribetsu, which, like Beppu, is known for its sulfurous waters (called \u201chells\u201d) and rising steam. But the city lacks any accommodation to rival Beppu\u2019s latest offering. There are large mid-range hotels close to the onsen that cater mostly to elderly Asian tourists, as well as ryokan, or traditional inns.\n\nAgain, these are a very different experience to the Beppu Hotel and Spa. Many ryokan are exquisite but they can be intimidating for an onsen novice. Guest rooms typically have tatami bedding, and because ryokan are located in rural areas, the language barrier can be a challenge.\n\nThe writer stayed as a guest of ANA InterContinental.\n\n", "description": "The ANA InterContinental Beppu is the perfect location to indulge in Japan\u2019s most quintessential pastime: escaping to an onsen.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1938%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/03708280a2f675556a33c02fefd2a5e117821b31", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
