test longest non-stop commercial flight flying 10,200 miles from New York to Sydney", "language": "en", "text": "A plane full of 50 passengers will test their mental and physical endurance on an 20 hour, non-stop flight from New York City to Sydney, Australia, in what is being called the \u2018final frontier in aviation.\u2019\n\nThe test flight, done under Australian commercial airline group Qantas, took off from the JFK airport at 9.27pm on Friday and is expected to land in Sydney at 7.32am on Sunday.\n\nPassenger numbers \u2013 mostly made up of Qantas employees \u2013 have been restricted to minimize the weight on the Boeing 787-9 plane and in hopes of travelling the 10, 200 miles without re-fueling.\n\nQantas (pictured) is testing the longest, non-stop flight from New York City to City that will take around 20 hours and won't have to stop for fuel\n\nIt\u2019s reported no other airline has successfully completed such an undertaking.\n\nThis flight will also be the first time Qantas will be monitoring six volunteers to collect data on a range of variables.\n\nCNBC reports that the volunteers were required to keep journals of their sleeping and eating patterns two weeks before the experimental flight.\n\nVolunteers have also been asked to keep the sleep journals on the flight and two weeks after to create a rounded assessment.\n\nThey will reportedly play Whack-a-Mole as they shift through various time zones to gauge their alertness.\n\nPictured: two maps showing the travel course the Qantas plane will follow on the flight that took of Friday\n\nPictured: a man who is one of 50 passengers flying on the Qantas test flight for 20 hours\n\nResearchers from the University of Sydney will set up shop in the plane, using the space as a laboratory to monitor things like temperatures, lighting schemes, recipes, stretching exercises and the effects of jet lag.\n\nSleeping patterns, and melatonin levels, will be one of the most interesting things to monitor as passengers will become impacted by a 15-hour time difference.\n\nUniversity of Sydney professor Stephen Simpson said this flight can help researchers understand the contributions to jet lag.\n\n\u2018We know from the basic science of circadian rhythms that a bigger time difference between departure and arrival locations, and travelling east rather than west, tends to mean people feel more jetlag,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018But people seem to be wildly different when it comes to the experience of jetlag -- and we need more research on what contributes to jetlag and travel fatigue, so we can try and reduce the impact of long-haul flights.\u2019\n\nPilots will also be included in the research and have been given special headbands that monitor brain activity.\n\nPilots (pictured) flying the direct, hours long flight will be wearing special head bands that will monitor their brain activity throughout the hours long journey\n\nThey will also provide urine samples to gauge their melatonin, a hormone that regulates that sleep-wake cycle in people.\n\nCameras will be mounted inside the cockpit to record pilots alertness and they will also be expected to keep sleep journals.\n\nEven with all the hype surrounding the flight, there are still people concerned about the safety of long-haul flights.\n\nQantas pilots have expressed apprehension about the impact of these lengthy flights have on safety protocols.\n\nThe Australian and International Pilots Association said the test flights, \u2018will produce a limited set of data that will not adequately replicate real-world flying conditions.\u2019\n\nShane Loney, the organizations safety director, has suggested a \u2018scientific long-term study\u2019 be conducted to measure the impacts on plane crews.\n\nPictured: a close up look at the headbands pilots will wear during the experimental flight that has some critics worried safety will be compromised for extensive direct flights\n\nHe said: \u2018Pilots are concerned about being able to get enough quality rest during ultra long-range flights to maintain peak performance and we believe significant caution should be exercised in the initial operations to make sure there are no unintended consequence.\u2019\n\nA Qantas spokesperson said the flight tests are, \u2018just one part of the work we are doing to assess how to operate these flights safely.\u2019\n\nBut the reality of these long hour flights becoming every day flights is \u2018ultimately a business decision,\u2019 Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said.\n\nThe economics will need to be in place for it to become regular air travel.\n\nQantas is encouraging both Boeing and European aerospace company Airbus to develop aircrafts that could complete a task like this with a full set of passengers.\n\nAccording to Qantas, if all goes well flights are estimated to start in 2022 or 2023.", "description": "Australian airline Qantas is testing the longest,
