The iffy penalty came on a Minshew incompletion in the second quarter on a first-and-10. That\u2019s when Brady tweeted: \u201cI\u2019m turning off this game I can\u2019t watch these ridiculous penalties anymore\u201d\n\nCoincidentally, Brady was the beneficiary of overprotective officiating in Week 2 when Bill Vinovich told Dolphins linebacker Raekwon McMillan to \u201cstay off Tom\u201d after a relatively small hit to the quarterback.\n\nI\u2019m turning off this game I can\u2019t watch these ridiculous penalties anymore #TENvsJAC \u2014 Tom Brady (@TomBrady) September 20, 2019\n\nCorrea\u2019s penalty followed a first quarter when there were six total penalties, including four penalties for offensive holding calls, one for an illegal block above the waist and one for offensive pass interference. That\u2019s when Brady began to get heated.\n\nToo many penalties. Just let us play!!!! #TENvsJAC \u2014 Tom Brady (@TomBrady) September 20, 2019\n\nBrady\u2019s comments invited conversation on the NFL Network broadcast. After seeing Brady\u2019s tweet, broadcast analyst Troy Aikman admitted he also thought the penalties were getting ridiculous. Twitter chimed in.\n\nJoe Buck calling for Tom Brady to come back and watch this game. Ain\u2019t happening. \u2014 Tedy Bruschi (@TedyBruschi) September 20, 2019\n\nTom Brady right now pic.twitter.com/wQoKuZJSjV \u2014 The Ringer (@ringer) September 20, 2019\n\nSorry Tom league has to protect its superstars pic.twitter.com/hXZB1yGLPe \u2014 Will Brinson (@WillBrinson) September 20, 2019\n\nI feel your pain, Tom.
