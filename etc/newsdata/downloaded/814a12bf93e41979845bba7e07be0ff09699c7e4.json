There was no debating the penalty, with Andreas Bouchalakis sticking out his left arm to block Insigne's shot, and Jorginho converted coolly.\n\nItaly's qualification was secured in the 78th minute when Bernardeschi let fly from 25 yards, with his effort taking a slight deflection and nestling in the bottom corner.\n\nInsigne came close to adding a third, Paschalakis producing another good save, but they did not have to wait long to celebrate a job well done.", "description": "Italy maintained their perfect record in Euro 2020 qualifying to book their place in next summer's finals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/23/19638894-0-image-a-9_1570920945836.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
