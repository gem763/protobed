The experience has a gamification element, as difficulty levels increase and employees can earn points as they progress.\n\nIn addition to making training processes more thorough and detailed, the bank claims that a major benefit of using the technology is the ability to train without impacting the actual operation or the customer experience.\n\nEarlier this year, Ita\u00fa has implemented cameras equipped with artificial intelligence technology to boost the security and customer service of physical branches.\n\nEnabling faster and more effective response time around criminal activity at branches was one of the main objectives of the project. Through a database, the cameras could identify suspicious activity at the premises, such as the presence of objects like firearms and iron bars.", "description": "The technology allows the simulation of risky situations in training processes.", "authors": ["Angelica Mari"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/09/cdfef1a5-da0d-4bdf-a102-1ed61b8e167e/thumbnail/770x578/cb0d213cac4c647bf8ffaacce9f996bf/ar.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
