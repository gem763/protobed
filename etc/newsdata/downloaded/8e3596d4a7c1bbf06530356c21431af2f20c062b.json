Its other members include payments company Visa, ride-hailing app Uber and humanitarian charity Mercy Corps.\n\nIn response to PayPal's withdrawal, Libra Association said it was aware that attempts to \"reconfigure the financial system\" would be hard.\n\n\"Commitment to that mission is more important to us than anything else,\" it said in a statement. \"We're better off knowing about this lack of commitment now.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has been criticised for the firm's record on data protection\n\nAt its unveiling this year, Facebook said people would be able to make payments with the currency via its own apps, as well as on messaging service WhatsApp. Partner firms would also be able to accept Libra for transactions.\n\nFacebook said Libra would be independently-managed and backed by real assets, and that paying with it would be as easy as texting.\n\nBut there have been concerns about how people's money and data will be protected, as well as over the potential volatility of the currency.\n\nThe Group of Seven advanced economies warned in July that it would not let Libra proceed until all regulatory concerns had been addressed.\n\nCentral bank chiefs, including the UK's Mark Carney, have also voiced scepticism, and US President Donald Trump has tweeted he is \"not a fan\" of the currency.\n\nThe Libra Association will hold the first meeting of its governing body - the Libra Council - on 14 October.\n\nThe group said in a tweet that it planned to share updates soon afterwards about \"1,500 entities that have indicated enthusiastic interest to participate\".", "description": "Libra has been strongly opposed by regulators around the world over privacy and financial concerns.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/821F/production/_109111333_paypal2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
