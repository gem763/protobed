Fur coat. Pantyhose. Fu Manchu mustache.\n\nAnd an arm that would make Superman proud.\n\nYep, Joe Namath is the NFL\u2019s greatest character. Guaranteed.\n\nThe Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback who guaranteed his three-touchdown underdog New York Jets would beat the mighty Baltimore Colts in the third Super Bowl was a solid choice in balloting conducted by The Associated Press in conjunction with the league\u2019s celebration of its 100th season. Namath earned 2,577 points in voting by a nationwide panel of 60 football historians and media who regularly cover the NFL.\n\n\u201cSonny (Werblin, the Jets owner) came from the entertainment business and he believed in the star system. He knew fans wanted to see stars,\u201d Namath said. \u201cWe thought of ourselves as just football players that nobody got to know except the guys we played with.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget this. I had dinner with the Werblins one night - this was late in the 1960s - and Sonny was telling me, \u2018You\u2019re a confident guy. Be more open, it will be better for everybody.\u2019 And I kept saying, \u2018It\u2019s just football. How much is there to talk about?\u2019\n\n\u201cSo finally, his wife leans over and says, \u2018Joe, don\u2019t worry, honey. It\u2019s all just show business,\u2019 and she turned out to be right. Sport was changing. Things were changing in society, too. \u2026\n\n\u201cAll that action off the field? Some of it was good and some not so good. But thank God, we\u2019re still here.\u201d\n\nAnd on top.\n\nNamath easily outdistanced the late Al Davis, owner of the Raiders and a former coach and AFL commissioner. Each had 12 first-place votes, but Davis wound up 162 points behind Namath.\n\nOnly Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre was on all 60 ballots. Favre finished fourth overall.\n\nNamath\u2019s career numbers weren\u2019t spectacular, but his impact on the sport was enormous. The Jets\u2019 win helped validate the AFL and the merger that NFL owners accepted. It boosted the Super Bowl toward elite sports status; no event in America gets more attention or draws a bigger audience.\n\nAnd Namath established the Jets as a force in a metropolitan area previously dominated by the Giants.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that a day goes by that I don\u2019t get reminded of that game,\u201d Namath said. \u201cI never get tired of talking about it. It\u2019s a memory that never gets old.\u201d\n\nConsider, also, that Jets fans over the last half-century have not seen their team return to the big game, let alone win it. Namath remains the biggest hero in franchise history.\n\nAlso consider that when anyone participating in the NFL is lauded (or even criticized for) their behavior, Namath\u2019s name tends to get mentioned.\n\nDavis was trailed in the voting by one of his coaches, John Madden. But Madden\u2019s persona is defined by his work in the announcing booth more than his work on the Raiders\u2019 sideline.\n\nFavre\u2019s feistiness and gambling style as Green Bay\u2019s quarterback made him a natural choice for the top five, and he was followed by the flamboyant Deion Sanders.\n\nOther characters in the top 30, which was revealed on NFL Network on Friday night, were colorful coaches Bum Phillips (No. 6), Mike Ditka (No. 10), Buddy Ryan (11th), Bill Parcells (12th) and Vince Lombardi (22nd); quarterback-turned broadcaster Don Meredith (17th); and such great-nicknamed characters as Chad (Ochocinco) Johnson at No. 14, Rob (Gronk) Gronkowski at No. 15, William (Refrigerator) Perry at No. 23; and Marshawn (Beast Mode) Lynch at No. 24.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "White shoes.
