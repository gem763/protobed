Liberals have predictably dialed up their impeachment calls.\n\nDon\u2019t go along: What Democrats and their media allies really want is to torpedo Attorney General William Barr\u2019s probe into the origins of the Russian \u201ccollusion\u201d hoax.\n\nNews of the Australian call followed an anonymous CIA officer\u2019s whistleblower complaint about a July call between Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, in which the American supposedly conditioned US aid to Ukraine on the Kiev government supplying dirt on Joe Biden.\n\nThen on Monday, the Times reported on Trump\u2019s ask from Morrison. Trump was again, the paper claimed, using \u201cdiplomacy for potential personal gain.\u201d\n\nBut how? Even if one thinks mentioning Biden on the Ukraine call was ill-advised, it\u2019s hard to see what\u2019s objectionable about the Australia call. After all, the \u00adbipartisan consensus to \u00aduncover possible foreign interference in the 2016 election led to Robert Mueller\u2019s special counsel investigation. To get to the bottom of foreign interference, Barr needs the cooperation of \u2026 foreign officials.\n\nAnd there\u2019s the rub. Democrats and the anti-Trump media were determined to keep the focus on Trump and Russia. Republicans, on the other hand, dismissed the collusion narrative, which turned out to be bunk, as the Mueller \u00adreport determined. Instead, the right pointed at coordination \u00adbetween the Hillary Clinton campaign and other foreign powers.\n\nDemocrats and the media say that\u2019s a right-wing conspiracy theory. But just because something isn\u2019t in the Mueller report doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t true. Thanks to reporting by Politico, for example, we know of efforts by Clinton operatives to solicit \u00adinformation from the Ukrainian government on dirty Trump campaign officials.\n\n\u201cOur country has been through a lot, and Ukraine knows a lot about it,\u201d Trump told Zelensky. That\u2019s true, and it\u2019s why Democrats, the press and anti-Trumpers in the security establishment and the permanent \u00adbureaucracy are worried.\n\nNote, for example, that the whistleblower\u2019s written complaint, based entirely on second- and third-hand information, presents Trump\u2019s request that the Ukrainian leader work with Barr to \u201cget to the bottom\u201d of the collusion hoax as part of the alleged quid pro quo. That suggests the whistleblower and his confreres in the \u00adintelligence apparatus are worried about Barr\u2019s investigation and what it could \u00aduncover about their spying on the Trump campaign.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint and the manic news reports of the Australia call both serve the same dual purpose: to \u00adadvance the anti-Trump operation and to shield its perpetrators by smearing Barr and thereby discrediting the investigations under his authority.\n\nThere are two known Department of Justice inquiries. One is a forthcoming inspector general report on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant on Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Congressional sources say the report is expected to be thorough and may include criminal referrals.\n\nThe investigation led by US Attorney John Durham, who \u00adreports to Barr, is more comprehensive. According to a Justice Department spokesperson, \u201cMr. Durham is gathering information from numerous sources, \u00adincluding a number of foreign countries.\u201d\n\nThe FBI\u2019s anti-Trump investigation began in July 2016, based on a tip from Alexander Downer, then Australia\u2019s envoy to Britain. He alleged that onetime Trump adviser George \u00adPapadopoulos had told him that the Russians had damaging \u00adinformation on Clinton.\n\nBarr is reportedly interested in Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud. The Rome-based academic hasn\u2019t been heard from in nearly two years. Well known to Italian and other Western intelligence services, Mifsud is alleged to have told Papadopoulos about Russia possessing dirt on Clinton.\n\nIf Mifsud is a Russian agent, as former FBI Director James Comey alleged, NATO countries will spend years assessing the damage. If he isn\u2019t, it\u2019s evidence that Comey\u2019s FBI wasn\u2019t probing the Trump campaign \u2014 but running a sting operation against it.\n\nInvestigators\u2019 most important stop is likely to be London, home of former British spy Christopher Steele, whose false and salacious reports written on behalf of the Clinton campaign won the FBI a warrant to spy on Page, the Trump adviser.\n\nIn the meantime, count on the continued efforts of Democrats and anti-Trump operatives in the intelligence community and media to discredit Barr. They have to stay on offense \u2014 or risk exposure.\n\nLee Smith\u2019s book \u201cThe Plot Against the President\u201d will be published this month.\n\nTwitter: @LeeSmithDC", "description": "Even if one thinks mentioning Biden on the Ukraine call was ill-advised, it\u2019s hard to see what\u2019s objectionable about the Australia call.", "authors": ["October"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/barr-media-trump-russia-investigation.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200"}
