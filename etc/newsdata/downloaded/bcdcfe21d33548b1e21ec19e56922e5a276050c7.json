As a result, Halfords was a loser on the FTSE 250, down 1.5 per cent or 7.2p to 488.5p.\n\n\n\nHome improvements retailer Kingfisher also suffered from the negative Barclays comment, with its target price reduced by the broker to 300p from 390p.\n\n\n\nAside from the interest rate concerns, Barclays highlighted the rise of the discounters as putting pressure on traditional retailers. Blue-chip Kingfisher fell 2.15p to 304.6p with Nomura also cutting its target price.\n\n\n\nThe overall picture across the Footsie was one of consolidation after a positive week with investors happier to sit on their hands ahead of the UK bank holiday weekend.\n\n\n\nThe FTSE 100 index closed 2.41 points lower at 6,775.25 reflecting a volatile early showing by US stocks as Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen sat on the fence in a keynote speech on monetary policy. She emphasised uncertainty over the state of the US labour market and therefore gave little away as to the likelihood of an early hike.\n\n\n\nMarket heavyweight Vodafone, up 3.25p at 205.85p, provided underlying support for the blue-chip index, as takeover chatter continued to surround the mobile phones group. Market rumours have suggested that US firm AT&T could still make a move despite having shot down speculation about an offer in January.\n\nTakeover chatter continues to surround the UK telecoms giant.\n\nRevived takeover speculation also boosted the share price of AstraZeneca, up another 6.5p to 4,418p, on talk that US pharma giant Pfizer could be mulling a new offer after its failed \u00a369billion bid earlier this year.\n\n\n\nAlso a gainer, Ashtead Group added 6p at 950p as the equipment rental firm benefited from a price target upgrade by broker Berenberg to 1,145p from 1,110p.\n\n\n\nRepeating its \u2018buy\u2019 rating on the stock, Berenberg said the investment case for Ashtead is based on an expected recovery in US non-residential construction, and the market share gains forecast through organic expansion and bolt-on merger and acquisition, as well as a positive outlook for margins.\n\n\n\nAirlines were among the worst blue-chip performers, with easyJet falling 5p to 1,319p on concerns over the possible impact on air travel from a volcanic eruption in Iceland. An eruption just 65 miles from the Icelandic capital Rekjavik in 2010 disrupted flights for more than 10million people.\n\n\n\nThe mid-cap FTSE 250 index notched up gains, ending 42.51 points higher at 15,881.08, with platinum and precious metals miner Lonmin a leading performer after being added to Goldman Sachs\u2019 influential Conviction Buy list. Lonmin shares gained 4.55p at 217.5p.\n\n\n\nAmong the small caps, North American-focused oil explorer Magnolia Petroleum surged nearly 60 per cent higher, up 0.55p to 1.60p after it revealed net production has increased by two thirds since April as a result of new wells coming online with a higher level of participation.\n\n\n\nTidal-power specialist Atlantis Resources was another good performer boosted by news it had secured an important funding packing for its flagship Meygen project in Scotland\u2019s Pentland Firth, which is set to become the largest tidal energy operation in the world. Atlantis shares gained 5.5p to 49.5p.\n\n\n\nBut moving in the opposite direction, California and Kansas-focused oil explorer Sefton Resources shed nearly a fifth of its value, down 0.025p to 0.14p as it warned that reduced investment is having a negative impact on its operations, with cash from production being drained by commitments to its banking facilities. The company is currently without any executive management.\n\n\n\nAnd Wildhorse Energy dropped 19 per cent or 0.075p to 0.325p after the alternative fuels company cancelled a rights issue saying that it plans to conduct a review and possible restructuring of its board, operations and strategy.\n\n", "description": "After a recent strong run helped by interest in the Tour de France\u2019s visit to Britain, some cautious broker comment caused the chain to come off for bicycle and car parts retailer Halfords.", "authors": ["Jonathon Hopkins For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
