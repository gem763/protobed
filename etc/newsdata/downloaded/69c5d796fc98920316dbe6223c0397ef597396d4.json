At least 21 homes have been destroyed in the blaze, California fire officials said on Friday.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe wildfires are expected to worsen in southern California over the weekend as gusty winds continue.\n\nCalifornia is still recovering from wildfires last year that killed about 100 people.\n\nWhere are the major fires?\n\nThe Kincade Fire, which started on Wednesday, has burned through 21,900 acres (8,800 hectares) of land in Sonoma County - one of California's best-known wine regions.\n\nMore than 1,300 firefighters are tackling the blaze, which remains uncontained.\n\nThere are a number of other major fires:\n\nThe Tick Fire in Los Angeles County has burned at least 5,000 acres in the Santa Clarita region\n\nThe Old Water Fire in San Bernardino County has burned 95 acres, shutting off a major highway\n\nThe Cabrillo Fire in San Mateo County, south of the town of Pescadero, has burnt about 95 acres\n\nThe Sawday Fire in San Diego County, which began on Friday, has burned 70 acres, some 40 miles northeast of San Diego\n\nThe ongoing Saddle Ridge Fire in Los Angeles County has burned 8,700 acres over the last 14 days\n\nWhat's caused the wildfires?\n\nAccording to a report filed to the California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday, a \"broken jumper\" - which connects power lines to towers - was discovered at 21:20 local time on Wednesday.\n\nThe fire began at 21:27, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nThe news sent share prices of PG&E tumbling on Friday, as investors feared the company might be held responsible for the Kincade Fire.\n\nThe company is already seeking bankruptcy protection as it faces lawsuits over last year's deadly Camp Fire. It was found to have been sparked by aging equipment owned by PG&E.\n\nIt spawned billions of dollars in liability claims against the company.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Homes have been destroyed in the town of Geyserville, which has been evacuated\n\nHigh winds appear to have spread the fires - gusts of up to 70mph (112km/h) have swept much of the state.\n\nCalifornia is affected by Santa Ana winds, which are known for being dry and gusty, exacerbating wildfires.\n\nWho is affected?\n\nOn Thursday morning PG&E shut off power in 15 California counties to prevent accidental fires, affecting about 180,000 homes.\n\nPower was restored to most customers on Thursday night. But officials warn of more outages over the weekend in regions experiencing high winds and dry heat.\n\nSchools in the Los Angeles Unified School District remained closed on Friday because of air quality and safety concerns.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The fire has spread rapidly due to heavy winds in the area\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The cause of the blaze is not known", "description": "Fires in the north and south of the US state have engulfed thousands of acres of land.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07s0flx.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
