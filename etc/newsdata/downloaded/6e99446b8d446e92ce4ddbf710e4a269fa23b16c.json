But that's besides the point. By filling out a few forms and becoming an official candidate for governor, Hampton has earned the right to spread lies and misinformation via Facebook ads, a loophole he contends is to open to anyone.\n\nEarlier this month, Facebook exempted politicians' advertisements from its broader rules that ban falsehoods in ads \u2014 effectively giving the all-clear to politicians and candidates for public office to spread deliberate falsehoods on Facebook's advertising platform without repercussions.\n\nThe decision has been intensely controversial, with Democrats in the US warning that it could impact the 2020 election, even as Zuckerberg defends the position on free speech grounds.\n\nHampton is now setting out to push the policy to its limits, by becoming a political candidate himself and paying for intentionally false political ads on Facebook.\n\nHampton, who also works in marketing, is something of a provocateur. He has already run one false ad on Facebook in recent weeks, which falsely claimed that Republican senator Lindsey Graham supports the Green New Deal. Facebook blocked that ad, but now he plans to run further false ads, using his political candidate status as a shield.\n\n\"It's incredibly simple. Anyone can do it. Facebook is f**ked. Or, we are going to win \u2014 they will have to change the policy,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nHis actions represent a fresh assault on Facebook's ad policy, which is facing increasingly widespread criticism. On Monday, The New York Times also reported that more than 250 Facebook employees had signed on to an internal letter calling on Facebook to fact-check political ads and make a number of other changes.\n\n\"I have been a Facebook advertiser for more than a decade, off and on. I've always had concerns about the platform, historically, but I think that its advertising has a lot of power, particularly in the political arena where people make decisions very emotionally,\" Hampton told Business Insider in an interview. \"I just think that Donald Trump, and any politician should be held to the same rule as you or I \u2014 or except that as of today, I have the golden ticket. I can do whatever I want.\"\n\nHe shrugged off the concern that his ads could further damage democracy, saying: \"I'm worried about fighting fire with fire, I'm worried about the policy.\" His total ad spend will only ever be a tiny fraction of Donald Trump's, he added.\n\nIt's not clear what Facebook's response will be once Hampton launches his new ads, and a spokesperson for the company did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nDo you work at Facebook?
