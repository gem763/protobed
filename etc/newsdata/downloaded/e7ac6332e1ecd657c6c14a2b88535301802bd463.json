The probe centers on Trump\u2019s summertime call with Ukraine\u2019s president, in which he presses for help investigating Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThat call is separate from the numerous conversations Trump had with foreign leaders as part of the investigation into the Russia probe. Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said Trump made those calls on Barr\u2019s behalf.\n\n\u201cAt Attorney General Barr\u2019s request, the President has contacted other countries to ask them to introduce the Attorney General and Mr. Durham to appropriate officials,\u201d Kupec said.\n\nTrump was requesting help for U.S. Attorney John Durham\u2019s investigation into the origins of special counsel Mueller\u2019s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The investigation outraged Trump, who cast it as a politically motivated \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nBarr traveled to Italy last week with Durham, where the two met with government officials as part of the investigation, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. As part of his investigation, Durham is examining what led the U.S. to open a counterintelligence investigation on the Trump campaign and the roles various countries played in that probe. The attorney general\u2019s presence on the trip exemplifies how much of an active role the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer is taking in overseeing the investigation.\n\nMueller wrapped up his report earlier this year with an inconclusive finding about Trump \u2014 the president was not charged with any crimes, but Mueller pointedly said he did not exonerate Trump. The president promptly called for an investigation into the origins of the Mueller probe.\n\nJustice officials said that has involved seeking help from numerous foreign countries, including Australia. The FBI\u2019s counterintelligence investigation that later became the Mueller probe was triggered, in part, from a tip from an Australian diplomat. George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, had told the diplomat, Alexander Downer, in May 2016 that Russia had thousands of stolen emails that would be potentially damaging to Hillary Clinton.\n\nPapadopoulos, who served as a foreign policy adviser to Trump\u2019s campaign, had learned from a Maltese professor that Russia had \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton in the form of stolen emails. The FBI\u2019s investigation into potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign later morphed into part of Mueller\u2019s probe.\n\nOne official said Trump told Prime Minister Scott Morrison that the attorney general would be contacting his Australian counterpart.\n\nMorrison\u2019s office said in a statement, \u201cThe Australian government has always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe P.M. confirmed this readiness once again in conversation with the President,\u201d the statement said, referring to Morrison.\n\nPapadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the 2016 conversation with the professor, Joseph Mifsud, and served a nearly two-week sentence in federal prison.", "description": "President Donald Trump asked the Australian prime minister and other foreign leaders to help Attorney General William Barr with an investigation into the...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HK353_barr_t_ZG_20190525142855.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
