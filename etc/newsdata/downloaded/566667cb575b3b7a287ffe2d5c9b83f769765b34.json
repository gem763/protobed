But the unpredictable nature of those talks kept investors from making big bets based on sentiment.\n\nThe benchmark closed 0.8 per cent lower, down about 56 points to 6,689.5. That was its lowest closing level in a week, after edging 0.1 per cent higher on Tuesday.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nThere was broad weakness across the major sectors, with even gold stocks, usually considered safer bets in times of uncertainty, falling.\n\nStay updated with\n\nBT newsletters Terms & conditions Sign up\n\nThe so-called \"Big Four\" banks all fell between 0.6 per cent to 1 per cent.
