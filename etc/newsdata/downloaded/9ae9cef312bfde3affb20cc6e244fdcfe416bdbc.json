The group includes former congressmen Bart Gordon and Jeff Denham.\n\nTikTok said the move will increase transparency around content moderation policies and its practices to protect users.\n\nCreated by Beijing Bytedance Technology Co, TikTok allows users to create and share short videos with special effects, and is hugely popular in Southeast Asia, including India.\n\nBut similar to other social media companies like Facebook (NASDAQ: ) and Twitter, the video app too has faced the ire of regulators related to content moderation on its platform.\n\nFacebook, the world's largest social network, is in the process of setting up an external oversight board to function as an independent court of appeals on content decisions from its moderators.", "description": "TikTok brings in ex-U.S. congressmen to review content policies", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9E1JX_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
