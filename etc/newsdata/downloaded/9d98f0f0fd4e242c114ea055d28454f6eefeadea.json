The argument was it takes too long, we don't have time, we should use it to make some money here and there, and that the owner should stop pumping money into it because it seemed like a waste.\n\nEmenalo worked with Antonio Conte and a number of other bosses during his time at the club\n\n'But that wasn't my idea and I had to fight against it. This is where I am very, very proud of the owner Roman Abramovich because of the trust he had in me and the willingness to listen to me and give the academy time. He would not abandon it. He believed in it and in me, and I can't thank him enough for that.'\n\nDespite Emenalo leaving Chelsea two years ago, his faith in the club's academy has finally started paying dividends this season.\n\nMason Mount, Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori have all come through the ranks to establish themselves as regular starters under Frank Lampard, who was in part appointed because of his willingness to use young players.\n\nThe trio have all been called up to the senior England squad for upcoming games against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria, while Callum Hudson-Odoi and Reece James, who have also featured under Lampard, are part of the Under 21 squad.", "description": "Former Chelsea technical director Michael Emenalo has revealed that one of the club's ex-managers urged Roman Abramovich to scrap the club's academy.", "authors": ["Joe Strange For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/12/19440986-0-image-a-40_1570535810413.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
