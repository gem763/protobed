You showed up, you wrote in, and your City Council heard you. Berkeley\u2019s City Council has voted unanimously to ban government use of face surveillance. \u2014 EFF (@EFF) October 16, 2019\n\nTwo other cities in the state, Oakland and San Francisco, have already passed their own bans on government use of facial recognition tech, while Governor Gavin Newsom recently signed a bill banning its use on police body cams for several years. Somerville, Massachusetts, also passed a similar law this summer.\n\nIn a letter proposing the change to the city\u2019s municipal code recorded in the meeting\u2019s agenda, Berkeley councilmembers Kate Harrison and Cheryl Davila wrote that the potential use of face recognition to track persons en masse would be an egregious violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n\nThey also wrote that the technology differs from stationary surveillance cameras by \u201c[eliminating] the human and judicial element behind the existing warrant system,\u201d in which government officials have to demonstrate that surveillance is both constitutional and sufficiently narrow to protect the rights of those targeted.\n\n\u201cDue to the inherent dragnet nature of facial recognition technology, governments cannot reasonably support by oath or affirmation the particular persons or things to be seized,\u201d the councilmembers wrote. \u201cThe programmatic automation of surveillance fundamentally undermines the community\u2019s liberty.\u201d They also pointed to a recent editorial by Secure Justice executive director Brian Hofer and ACLU attorney Matt Cagle that it took San Francisco decades to compile intelligence files on over 100,000 people by 1973, whereas face recognition could enable them to \u201cstockpile information on 100,000 residents in a few hours.\u201d\n\nThe dystopian potential of facial recognition technology has already been demonstrated in China, where the government has employed the method as it swept an estimated million members of the Uighur minority into concentration camps and recently implemented rules mandating face scans for those signing up for internet or getting a new phone number.\n\nMeanwhile, research has shown the technology is also indiscriminate: 28 members of U.S. Congress were misidentified as criminals in one test, while Amazon\u2019s Rekognition software has reportedly shown serious racial and gender bias. (Despite pitching it to cops and federal immigration authorities, Amazon has shown a disturbing lack of concern for how Rekognition could be abused by customers beyond some handwavey references to its terms of service.)\n\n\u201cThe epidemic spread of facial recognition is a human rights crisis,\u201d Evan Greer, deputy director of pro-privacy and anti-censorship group Fight for the Future, said in a statement. \u201cBut we still have a chance to draw a line in the sand. The local advocates and lawmakers in Berkeley who passed this ban are showing us the way. Our surveillance nightmares are not inevitable. We\u2019re fighting to ban government use of facial recognition everywhere.\u201d", "description": "Berkeley, California became the fourth U.S. city to pass a ban on all government use of facial recognition technology on Wednesday following a unanimous yes vote by the City Council....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/wmo2hhocifsv2ofw8lp7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
