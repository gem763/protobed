Council member Brandon Todd, a liberal attached at the hip to Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser, jump-started the discussions on Oct. 2, saying \u201cwe\u201d must look to future planning and spending by considering the projected \u201cadditional $80 million in revenue\u201d expected to find a home in D.C. coffers in FY 2020.\n\nLike the wealthiest of wealthy government philanthropists, Mr. Todd wants you to help him divine ways to spend money \u2014 your money. He also promises he \u201cwill continue to ensure that taxpayer dollars are being spent in a responsible and efficient manner.\u201d\n\nA short backstory.\n\nMr. Todd is the Democrat who successfully won council approval for the Standard of Care for Animals Amendment Act of 2017, which entrusts the D.C. government to ensure that Fido and Milkshake live as fabulously as Miss Hilton\u2019s pooches in a two-story, Spanish-style colonial all their own. It has a balcony and black wrought-iron railings, and great views of Los Angeles, and the various pooches can bark, sniff and romp as much as they desire.\n\nD.C. standards for puppy (adult) dog pals are such an extreme. In fact, the new law that taxpayers will be financing goes into great detail about the roofs that dog houses must have over their heads.\n\nCheck out the definition of \u201cadequate shelter,\u201d courtesy of the Humane Rescue Alliance website: \u201cWhen the temperature is at or below 40 degrees Fahrenheit, \u2018adequate shelter\u2019 shall mean that a the dog has access to a shelter large enough for the dog to stand up and turn around, that has an entrance covered by a flexible wind-proofing material or self-closing door, that contains a platform for the dog at least 4 inches off the ground, and that contains dry bedding, which must consist of an insulating material that does not retain moisture, such as straw, of sufficient depth for the dog to burrow. When the temperature is at or above 80 degrees Fahrenheit, \u2018adequate shelter\u2019 shall additionally mean that a dog has access to a shelter shaded by trees, a roof, a tarp, or a tarp-like device.\u201d\n\nGuess that excludes the publicly funded dog parks you\u2019ve already for.\n\nHowever, the new protect-Fido-at-all-cost regulations mean you and families like you who leave their dogs outdoors while at home or school are in trouble if the dog keepers are on the prowl. Shame on you for letting your four-legged friend lie on the deck or front porch.\n\nWhat\u2019s troubling about the pooch pitch is that two human beings died in an unregulated house earlier this year, and lawmakers like Mr. Todd have been mum. The house had wrought-ironing railing, which prohibited the residents from getting out and which first responders had to contend with to get in.\n\nAn oversight hearing that probes why Mr. Todd, his council colleagues and the Bowser administration allowed that to happen and the planned corrective measures would have public support for new public revenues. Unfortunately, Mr. Todd doesn\u2019t throw his weight behind such weighty issues.\n\nLike a stereotypical millennial, he prefers new shiny things vs. what\u2019s effective.\n\nHe\u2019d rather waste his political capital on pet standards \u2014 as if Paris Hilton and her pooches reside along the Potomac.\n\n\u2981 Deborah Simmons can be contacted at [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
