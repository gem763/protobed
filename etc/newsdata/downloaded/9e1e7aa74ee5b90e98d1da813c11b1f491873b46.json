I surmise he is really trying to turn up the heat on the DUP to get them on board.\n\nBut we are heading towards show-time when the PM brings back his deal to the Commons.\n\nThere are a lot of MPs who will be unhappy that he is rushing Parliament into a vote when they haven't had the text to study what they're voting for.\n\nThere's another emerging battle too as we learnt the Labour Party is increasingly likely to back a so-called confirmatory referendum - meaning they would only approve the deal if it was put to a referendum.\n\nBut one thing I've been told is that Boris Johnson will not hold a vote on his deal unless he's confident of winning it.\n\nSo we are heading for one humungous showdown.", "description": "The PM calls the agreement \"a great new deal\", but the DUP say they still cannot support it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/EB1A/production/_109268106_cbda56bc-59af-4eb4-8ddc-79dcc2dd1651.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
