According to her philosophy - which is similar to the holistic life philosophy - the body and mind are linked. Physical issues cannot be separated from psychological and emotional disorders.\n\nHere FEMAIL reveals some of her tips...\n\nHildegard de Bingen (pictured) was a medieval nun born at the turn of the 11th century, who was an Benedictine Abbess, a scholar, music composer and famous healer, as well as a pioneer of the holistic lifestyle\n\n1. A HEALTHY, PREVENTIVE LIFESTYLE WITH SPELT\n\nAccording to Hildergard, 70 percent of our health is down to what we eat, whilst the remaining 30 percent is due to our environment and our emotions.\n\nHildegard was all about preventing diseases through a healthy diet. She turned to spelt, an ancient form of wheat as well as fruit and veg. In order to provide her body with the levels of energy it needed, the abbess balanced her acid and alkaline compounds intake.\n\nMeat, poultry, fish, dairy, eggs, grains, alcohol are acidic types of foods. Meanwhile fruits, nuts, legumes, and vegetables are known as food rich in alkaline compounds.\n\nHildegard de Bingen's Holistic Health Secrets, by M\u00e9lanie Schmidt-Ulmann is published by Eddison Books\n\nApplied to a modern diet, Hildegard's recommendations call for little processed food and ready meals, while ingredients are steam-cooked rather than fried.\n\n2. FASTING LIKE HILDEGARD\n\nHildegard believed that fasting would do anyone good, especially healthy people. Rather than promoting the complete absence of food, she based hers on a few healthy foods she could rely on, like spelt and vegetables.\n\nThe fast could be done from a day a week to longer periods of time, such as three times a week, a week or even longer.\n\nTo ease into fasting, try to start on a Sunday. It can be a good way to recharge your batteries at the turn of the seasons.\n\nTen ingredients to add to your diet 1. SPELT An ancient variety of wheat, which is richer in minerals than modern wheat, including in magnesium, iron, zinc and phosphorus. It is high in protein and as well as in vitamin A, B and E. 2. OATS Oats are valued for their high countenance in fibre, which help blood cholesterol and insulin levels. It is thus a great way to prevent cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. 3. CHICKPEAS Chickpeas are alkalinizing food , which means. They are also rich in vegetable protein, and provide the eight amino acid, which are called 'essential acids' because they cannot be produced by the body. 4. DRIED BEANS Hildegard recommended eating beans four to five times a week and to vary the pleasures by tasting different types of beans. Dry beans are rich in protein, fibre and carbohydrates. They also contain starch, which is great to the intestinal flora, and encourages the growth of good bacteria. 5. CHESTNUTS The chestnut is the fruit of the sweet chestnut tree, not to be confused by the horse chestnut. Chestnuts are rich in carbohydrates, and mainly composed of starch, which is good for gut health. 6. FENNEL Fennel is rich in potassium, and was used by Hildegard as a 'cure-all.' It is credited with lowering blood pressure and helping keep the urinary track system in check. Rich in fibre and water, fennel is particularly good for detoxing. 7. PSYLLIUM Hildegard would recommend to ingest this seed, which comes from the sand plantain. The seed is actually not absorbed by the body. Instead, it forms a protective gel on the intestinal wall which fights constipation and. It accelerates transit without damaging the body, making it one of the best natural laxatives. 8. NUTMEG Hildegard was convinced that nutmeg 'opened the heart' and lift up the spirits. It also has medical properties, especially when it comes to fighting indigestion. 9. GALANGAL Galangal belongs to the ginger family. It helps with digestion by facilitating intestinal transit. It can be used to treat abdominal pain, gastric acidity, hiccups and indigestio. 10. DAIRY-FREE DRINKS This category covers all drinks that are free of dairy, including plant-based milks. Hildegard believed dairy should only be ingested in small doses and forgone completely during the summer.\n\nParsley is said to have a beneficial effect on the whole digestive system, the liver and spleen\n\nDuring a day of fasting, Hildegard would have a herbal or light tea for breakfast without sugar, as well as two homemade ginger biscuits.\n\nFor lunch, she would have a big bowl of soup and a bowl of clear vegetable soup for dinner.\n\nHowever a fast needs to be handled with certain precautions.\n\nYou'll need to keep yourself hydrated as much as possible throughout the fast.\n\nStart with baby steps and don't jump in on a three-day-long fast.\n\nBe self-assure in your abilities to go through with the fast in order not to give up.\n\nSpelt (pictured) is an ancient variety of wheat that is richer in mineral, especially in magnesium, iron, zinc and phosphorus as well as three types of vitamins\n\nIt's always good to talk to a doctor if you suffer from a chronic illness or are undergoing medical treatment.\n\nFasting is not recommended for people that are very thin or suffer from eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia. It is unsuitable for children, pregnant women and mothers that are breastfeeding.\n\n3. PRAY OR MEDITATE\n\nHildegard encouraged people to pay attention to when they were active, needed rest, to pray or to meditate.\n\nThe most important step was to make time for these moments of meditation and introspection.\n\nShe said to use this quiet time to ask yourself the right questions amnd explore new perspective.\n\nShe advised to start the day with a good breakfast and breathing exercises as well as with a few minute of meditation to give your day purpose and direction. Lack of direction leads to anxiety and depression according to her philosophy,\n\n4. CRYSTALS\n\nHildegard was a firm believer in lithotherapy, the therapeutic use of crystals to heal the body.\n\nIt is said that minerals resonate with the human body, which is also made of minerals. One of the most effective way to use a crystal is to hold one in your hand for 15 minutes a day.\n\nM\u00e9lanie Schmidt-Ulmann studied at the Hildegard Institute in Colorado and became obsessed with the Medieval nun\n\nYou can also sleep with it by putting it in your pillowcase. The larger the stone, the more effective it will be.\n\nThe easiest way to make the most of a stone\u2019s properties is to hold it in your hand for 15 minutes every day, or to sleep with it, putting it in your pillowcase to ensure it is beside.\n\nIt is important that you clean your stone after using it, so that it can get rid of your energies.\n\nStones like Amber warms the body and the heart whilst Aquamarine is credited with helping the respiratory track system and healing sore throats.", "description": "Hildegard of Bingen was a 12th century\u00a0abbess born in Southwest Germany.
