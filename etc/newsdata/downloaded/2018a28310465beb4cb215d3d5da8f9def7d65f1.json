Last year, there was an attempt to assassinate a former Russian spy in Britain using a nerve agent. Though the operations bore the fingerprints of Russia\u2019s intelligence services, the authorities initially saw them as isolated, unconnected attacks.\n\nWestern security officials have now concluded that these operations, and potentially many others, are part of a coordinated and ongoing campaign to destabilize Europe, executed by an elite unit inside the Russian intelligence system skilled in subversion, sabotage and assassination\u2026\n\n\u201cThis is a unit of the G.R.U. that has been active over the years across Europe,\u201d said one European security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe classified intelligence matters. \u201cIt\u2019s been a surprise that the Russians, the G.R.U., this unit, have felt free to go ahead and carry out this extreme malign activity in friendly countries. That\u2019s been a shock.\u201d\u2026\n\nBut officials began to grasp the unit\u2019s specific agenda of disruption only after the March 2018 poisoning of Mr. Skripal, a former G.R.U. officer who had betrayed Russia by spying for the British. Mr. Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, fell grievously ill after exposure to a highly toxic nerve agent, but survived.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com World Europe"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
