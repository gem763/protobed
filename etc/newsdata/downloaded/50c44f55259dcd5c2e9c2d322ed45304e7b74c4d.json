But it represents a sea change from the hardline stance of the previous coalition government between Di Maio's 5Star Movement and Matteo Salvini's far-right League party.\n\nThe new government, composed of the 5Stars and the center-left Democratic Party, took office earlier this month.\n\nItaly\u2019s culture minister, Dario Franceschini, tweeted that the move marked the \u201cend of Salvini\u2019s propaganda on the backs of desperate people at sea.
