The speech was on religious liberty, soul freedom and freedom of conscience. I have been waiting for years, even decades, for an American president to so articulately set forth the bedrock foundation upon which our Constitution and our freedoms are built.\n\nPresident Trump delivered the speech I would have wanted to deliver if I ever had been given the opportunity to do so. He began by proclaiming, \u201cThe United States is founded on the principle that our rights do not come from government; they come from God. This immortal truth is proclaimed in our Declaration of Independence and enshrined in the First Amendment to our Constitution\u2019s Bill of Rights. Our founders understood that no right is more fundamental to a peaceful, prosperous and virtuous society than the right to follow one\u2019s own religious convictions.\u201d\n\nThe president then went on to explain, \u201cRegrettably, religious freedom enjoyed by American citizens is rare in the world. Approximately 80% of the world\u2019s population lives in countries where religious liberties are threatened, restricted or even banned.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we speak, Jews, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs and many other people of faith are being jailed, sanctioned, tortured and even murdered, often at the hands of their own government, simply for expressing their deeply held religious beliefs. Today with one clear voice, the United States of America calls upon the nations of the world to end religious persecution.\u201d\n\nNote \u201cone clear voice\u201d\u2014this is an important distinction. In this stirring speech, President Trump proclaimed America\u2019s solidarity with people of all faiths around the globe, as he said, \u201cAmerica stands with believers in every country who ask only for the freedom to live according to the faith that is within their own hearts.\u201d He then went on to say, \u201cAmerica will always be a voice for victims of religious persecution everywhere.\u201d\n\nThen he pointed out that true tolerance means \u201crespecting the right of all people to express their deeply held religious beliefs. The United States of America will forever remain at your and the side of all who seek religious freedom. Today I ask all nations to join us in this urgent moral duty. We ask the governments of the world to honor the eternal right of every person to follow their conscience, live by their faith and give glory to God.\u201d\n\nThis was a great speech proclaiming the highest and noblest of American ideals, which we believe are universal values\u2014the right of everyone, not just Americans, to worship and live their lives according to the dictates of their own consciences without interference from government.\n\nAnother section of the president\u2019s speech I believe deserves special attention calls the world community to concerted action to stop heinous crimes being committed against people of faith around the globe.\n\n\u201cIn recent times,\u201d the president said, \u201cthe world also has witnessed devastating acts of violence in sacred places of worship. In 2016, an 85-year-old Catholic priest was viciously killed while celebrating mass in Normandy, France. In the past year, the United States endured horrifying anti-Semitic attacks against Jewish-Americans at synagogues in Pennsylvania and California. In March, Muslims praying with their families were sadistically murdered in New Zealand. On Easter Sunday this year, terrorists bombed Christian churches in Sri Lanka killing hundreds of faithful worshipers.\u201d\n\nAnd, the president continued, these \u201cevil attacks are a wound on all humanity. We must all work together to protect communities of every faith. We\u2019re also urging every nation to increase prosecution and punishment of crimes against religious communities.\u201d\n\nThank you, Mr. President. Your words were long overdue and never more needed.", "description": "On Monday, President Donald Trump delivered a truly historic\u00a0speech at .09/27/2019 1:39:06AM EST.", "authors": ["Richard Land", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Reagan Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/267/6e71c29d-f45e-489a-933f-3b242b5291d7.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
