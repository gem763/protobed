If Etzebeth is found not guilty I would like to call upon Jones to resign as he would then have grossly infringed upon Etzebeth's basic human right not to be judged before all allegations have been confirmed.\n\nEtzebeth is a professional rugby player at a World Cup. To call for him to return to South Africa to clear his name if he is indeed not guilty borders on idiocy.\n\nPW Koekemoer", "description": "Etzebeth is a professional rugby player at a World Cup.
