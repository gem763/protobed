Two recent hacks may have changed that perception, and Apple is now a top target for hackers.\n\nFuture cyberattacks are likely to target iPhone and Mac users thanks to the global reach of Apple's proprietary software.\n\nPreviously, hackers were most likely to prey on Microsoft and its Windows operating system. Apple could be next.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nFor years, Apple was seen as the gold standard of cybersecurity, and its apps and operating systems were thought to be impenetrable.\n\nTwo high-profile hacks in 2019 may have shattered that conception.\n\nLast spring, hackers used a vulnerability in the messaging app WhatsApp to install malware on smartphones, including iPhones. The hack took over users' phones after they accepted phone calls from hackers through WhatsApp, the Financial Times first reported in May.\n\nThen an even more explosive Apple hack surfaced: Google researchers revealed in August that a massive iPhone hack may have targeted Uighur Muslims in China. Victims' iPhones were compromised when they visited specific malicious websites, which were able to install spyware. In both cases, Apple had patched the issues by the time they were made public.\n\nThe more recent iPhone hack was a feat that was previously seen as impossible. Not only did hackers infiltrate iOS, they also gained access to a slew of information available on a victim's iPhone: location data, photos, and messages were all up for grabs.\n\nNow, a cybersecurity expert predicts even more Apple hacks going forward. Alex Heid, chief research and development officer at the cybersecurity firm SecurityScorecard, told Business Insider that Apple is now a top target for hackers seeking money or power.\n\nRead more: 5 recent hacks that show smartphones are more vulnerable than we thought\n\nAn Apple spokesperson declined to comment. Apple touted its cybersecurity measures in a statement on iOS security published last month.\n\nHere's why Heid says we haven't seen the last of cyberattacks on Apple.", "description": "For years, Apple was seen as the gold standard of cybersecurity.
