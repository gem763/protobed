It now faces calls for its royal warrants \u2013 meaning it has supplied products to the two royal households for at five years \u2013 to be withdrawn.\n\nDaily Mail campaign: Give The Children Their Jabs\n\nThe revelation comes after Simon Stevens, the head of NHS England, warned yesterday that homeopaths are spreading \u2018misinformation\u2019 about jabs which pose \u2018a significant danger to human health\u2019.\n\nTwo weeks ago the Daily Mail launched a major campaign to improve the uptake of childhood immunisations amid rising cases of measles and mumps.\n\nWe bought a copy of the Ainsworths book, called the Mother & Child Remedy Prescriber. The guide, which costs \u00a34.95, promises to \u2018help parents through the emotional and physical challenges of pregnancy, childbirth and baby/infant stages\u2019.\n\nHomeopathic pharmacy Ainsworths, which has two royal warrants, in Marylebone, London\n\nIn a section titled \u2018Vaccination\u2019, the \u2018self-help\u2019 booklet says: \u2018Homeopathy was the forerunner of conventional vaccination and offers the clearest answer as to how to deal with the prevention of disease.\n\n\u2018Homeopathy offers two clear options for mothers confronted by the emotional pressure to have their child vaccinated, enabling a well-considered and safe outcome. The first is a as a complete alternative to vaccination, the second is a means of damage limitation for the ill-effects of conventional vaccinations administered.\u2019\n\nIt continues to explain how \u2018remedies based on childhood diseases\u2019 including measles, mumps, rubella, polio and meningitis can form \u2018an alternative preventative programme\u2019.\n\nNHS England's chief executive Simon Stevens (pictured) has launched an outspoken attack on the homeopathy industry\n\nThe book claims these \u2018will strengthen the child\u2019s immune system more ably than any vaccine\u2019. It lists seven different clinically unproven homeopathic remedies for measles including aconite, which it says \u2018is a remedy for the very early stages of measles\u2019, and pulsatilla which it calls \u2018is one of the most important remedies for measles\u2019.\n\nSeparately, Ainsworths also sells substances online which other homeopaths say provide \u2018natural immunity\u2019 against infectious diseases including measles.\n\nThe pharmacy does not make any claims on their website about what the substances should be used for. However, they are all used in a practice called homeoprophylaxis \u2013 which involves administering tiny doses of diseased tissue called \u2018nosodes\u2019.\n\nCritics say this amounts to \u2018dangerous quackery\u2019 and that the pills are typically so dilute that not a single molecule of the substance remains. They include morbillinum, promoted as an alternative to the measles jab, and a \u2018polio nosode\u2019 and a \u2018meningeoma nosode\u2019, promoted by some homeopaths as \u2018natural\u2019 ways to prevent polio and meningitis.\n\nAinsworths is continuing to sell the remedies despite the Government\u2019s medicine watchdog, the MHRA, taking action against it in 2013, aiming to ensure it was \u2018no longer advertising homeopathic products as alternative treatments to proven, conventional vaccines\u2019. The labels have now been changed and no longer contain the word vaccine.\n\nLeading doctors last night accused Ainsworths of spreading \u2018dangerous misinformation\u2019.\n\nEdzard Ernst, emeritus professor of complementary medicine at Exeter University, said its royal warrants should be withdrawn \u2018as a matter of urgency\u2019.\n\nYesterday's Mail: NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens accused practitioners of spreading toxic 'misinformation' about jabs, posing 'a significant danger to human health'\n\nHe added: \u2018Ainsworths has a long history of promoting the most irresponsible anti-vaccination propaganda... It is hard to think of any UK enterprise for which royal warrants are less justified.\n\n\u2018The homeopathic remedies sold as an alternative to proper vaccinations are not just ineffective, they are a serious danger to public health.\u2019\n\nMichael Marshall, of scientific charity the Good Thinking Society, said: \u2018It\u2019s enormously dangerous for organisations like Ainsworths to be spreading this misinformation that homeopathy is a credible alternative to vaccinations.\n\n\u2018They are using reputation and legitimacy of royal crest to spread vaccine misinformation. If you\u2019re a parent of a young child you will see the royal crest on there and think the royal family are backing it and endorsing it.\u2019\n\nMr Marshall added: \u2018Homeopathic remedies contain no active ingredients at all. They\u2019re so dilute that they contain virtually nothing but sugar and water - that is not going to prevent you from catching measles.\u2019\n\nExperts say that although homeopathy is not in itself harmful, parents who forego vaccination in favour of homeopathic alternatives lower herd immunity \u2013 putting their own children and others at risk of diseases including measles.\n\nAinsworths has previously been criticised for selling treatments including a \u2018lamentable\u2019 homeopathic remedy said to contain essence of the Berlin Wall that it said helped treat depression.\n\nAinsworths, Buckingham Palace and Clarence House all declined to comment.", "description": "The Queen's chemist, Ainsworths, which has two royal warrants, has been condemned as 'dangerous' for claiming homeopathic remedies can provide a 'complete alternative to vaccination'.", "authors": ["Eleanor Hayward", "Guy Adams For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/21/20299854-0-image-a-61_1572299502031.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
