Carlos says he was with her this weekend and had no idea this was going to happen\n\nColeen, (pictured today left) is embroiled in a bitter row with Rebekah (right) over Coleen's claims that her fellow WAG may have been selling stories about her to a national newspaper\n\n'Jamie and Wayne played together and it's just awful that people can make accusations like that, especially when Rebekah is pregnant. Her account must have been hacked.\n\n'I felt I had to say something because my daughter is so upset by the whole thing. Rebekah has only ever had praise for Colleen - I'm just stunned.'\n\nCarlos (pictured), a 66-year-old chauffeur, said his daughter is devastated at the claims\n\nMr Miranda, who still works as a chauffeur, added: 'Why would my daughter want to make money from something like this?\n\n'She's completely devastated by the whole thing. She's had to come back from her holiday in Dubai early.'\n\nMr Miranda revealed he was in shock when he came home from work on Wednesday to see his daughter's face all over the news.\n\nHe said: 'I know people are sick of Brexit, but I came home at lunch and put on the TV and my daughter's face was on nearly every channel.\n\n'I had to switch the TV off in the end. I went to the Liverpool versus Leicester game last week and we had simply no idea this was about to kick off.'\n\nRebekah said she was devastated yesterday after her fellow WAG accused her of selling stories to the press through information she obtained on her private Instagram account.\n\nShe turned detective and blocked every one of her 'friends' on her profile apart from her main suspect, Rebekah.\n\nColeen then shared fake information about herself, including that she had gone to Mexico for gender selection and was planning a return to TV.\n\nColeen and Rebekah (pictured together in 2016) were thought to be close before this row. Coleen turned sleuth when she suspected that one of her friends was selling stories about her\n\nColeen's husband Wayne (pictured above) is said to have warned his former England teammate Jamie Vardy before about his wife Rebekah's social media posts at previous tournaments\n\nRebekah Vardy's father Carlos defended his daughter in her spat with fellow WAG Coleen Rooney. Heavily pregnant Rebekah is being supported by husband Jamie in Dubai (above)\n\nThe information then appeared in the press \u2013 leading Coleen to point the finger of suspicion at Rebekah.\n\nIn an extraordinary Instagram rant she said: 'It's been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to.\n\n'Now I know for certain which account/individual it's come from. I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.\n\n'It's\u2026 Rebekah Vardy's account.'\n\nBut Becky, who appeared on I'm A Celeb in 2017, has furiously denied the accusations, saying she is 'disgusted' Coleen didn't call her first to discuss the issue.\n\nShe retaliated in another online post: 'If you thought this was happening you could have told me and I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.'\n\nLast night MailOnline revealed that Rebekah had cut her family holiday short in Dubai to fly home and be with family amidst the ongoing drama.\n\nSources close to the TV star say she has been 'distraught' and 'inconsolable' after the row erupted.\n\nShe's also vowed to prove her innocence by working with a lawyer and team of IT forensic experts to verify that she wasn't the only person accessing her account.\n\nRebekah has been viciously trolled by supporters of Coleen who've sent her malicious messages including that her 'unborn baby should die within her.'\n\nThis afternoon Leicestershire police spent around 20 minutes at Rebekah's home.\n\nIt's believed they were sent to discuss the family's security with their housekeeping in preparation for Rebekah's return home from Dubai.\n\nEarlier today ex-Wag Danielle Lloyd appeared on This Morning and claimed she's had 'similar run-ins' with Rebekah before.\n\nBut it wasn't long before Rebekah hit back saying the accusations were false and she alleged that Danielle was only 'fuming that she didn't get Jamie recruiting for her like she asked me to\u2026'\n\nRebekah's husband Jamie publicly showed his support for the first time by liking her tweet.\n\nBut in another blow Danielle referred to Rebekah as 'not a girls' girl' while using the Pinocchio emoji to signify that she's not telling the truth.", "description": "Rebekah Vardy's father\u00a0Carlos Miranda has broken his silence on the WAG row between his daughter and Coleen Rooney as he said he was baffled by the 'baseless' accusations against her.", "authors": ["Sarah Packer And Paul Thompson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/16/19547362-0-image-a-28_1570722329776.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
