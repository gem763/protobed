The statement was obviously a mistake; there is no such thing as an F-52 yet. The aircraft only exists in the context of a video game called \u201cCall of Duty: Advanced Warfare\u201d\u2014however, there was once a real-world concept that looks similar to the fiction jet.\n\n\u201cIn November we started delivering the first F-52s and F-35 fighter jets,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have a total of 52 and they\u2019ve delivered a number of them already a little ahead of schedule.\u201d\n\nThe aircraft that appears in Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare is clearly based on early 1990s-era Lockheed Martin concepts for the Naval Advanced Tactical Fighter and the later A/F-X\u2014both of which were based on the YF-22 demonstrator aircraft that eventually became the F-22 Raptor.\n\nCongress had mandated that the Advanced Tactical Fighter program\u2014which resulted in the F-22\u2014be a joint effort between the Air Force and the Navy. Even though the service had dropped out of the ATF program, the U.S. Navy still had a vote on which aircraft would be selected for what became the Raptor program. The Navy\u2019s choice was the naval variant of the YF-22 design, which looked like bizarre hybrid of a Raptor and F-14 Tomcat with variable geometry wings.\n\n\u201cThe team, working hard on every detail of our NATF [Naval Advanced Tactical Fighter] design in late 1989 and early 1990, produced a very stealthy swing-wing fighter that could supercruise. It was very suitable for carrier operations,\u201d according to Sherm Mullin, the Lockheed Skunk Works lead for the ATF program. \u201cThe Navy still got a vote in the ATF competition, and, as we found out later for certain, it cast it for our F-22 team.\u201d\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Better than the F-35?
