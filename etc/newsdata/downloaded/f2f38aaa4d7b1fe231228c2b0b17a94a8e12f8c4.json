In fact, the top-ranked vehicle, on its own, outsells nearly every automotive brand in the country, including Chevrolet, Nissan and Hyundai.\n\nThis group of 10 vehicles is the market in a nutshell: a pickup truck quartet, a handful of struggling passenger cars and a crossover trio. You won\u2019t find any European badges on their grilles, you won\u2019t spot a charge port disguised as a fuel cover, and you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to locate a performance variant.\n\nThankfully, the degree to which a fraction of the available new vehicle nameplates exerts such control of the market hasn\u2019t stopped automakers (yet) from offering some of the most diverse portfolios in the industry\u2019s history.\n\nCanadian automotive sales are down 4 per cent this year, according to Global Automakers of Canada, but that doesn\u2019t mean brands such as Mercedes-Benz aren\u2019t displaying 30 different body styles. Ford isn\u2019t reining in its 10-pronged Mustang lineup. Toyota and Lexus now offer 10 different SUVs and crossovers.\n\nIt\u2019s quite clear Canadian buyers generally tend to steer toward the same vehicles. But there\u2019s still an abundance of choice in this era of rapid automotive change.\n\n10. Hyundai Elantra: 30,130 sales, down 10 per cent\n\nHere\u2019s the bad news: it\u2019s not just the Elantra that\u2019s down. Once a consistent challenger for the Honda Civic, the still-popular Elantra is losing ground fast in the Canadian marketplace. But the Elantra is just one part of a Hyundai car lineup that\u2019s struggling.\n\nAccent sales are down 32 percent this year; Sonata volume is off last year\u2019s pace by 14 per cent. Hyundai Canada car sales are down by more than 5,000 units this year.\n\nThe good news: Hyundai generated 9,835 more sales with the Kona and Tucson through the first nine months of 2019 than during the same period last year, and added 2,369 Palisade sales, too.\n\n9. Ford Escape: 30,817 sales, down 12 per cent\n\n2019 isn\u2019t a good year for evaluating Ford Escape sales performance. Through 2015, the Escape was consistently Canada\u2019s top-selling utility vehicle. But the aging third-gen Escape is just now entering a replacement phase as an all-new Escape takes its place. That may help to explain why Escape sales are down sharply this year, but it bears mentioning Escape volume was also down 8 per cent last year.\n\n8. Toyota Corolla: 37,349 sales, down 1 per cent\n\nA new Corolla is a sure bet, right? Toyota dealers used to salivate over news of an all-new Corolla. After all, it\u2019s not a common occurrence in Toyota showrooms. This year\u2019s all-new model certainly helps, but in a decidedly anti-car market, the new Corolla doesn\u2019t so much bring about a surge in demand as it does limit the damage.\n\nGone are the days when the launch of an all-new passenger car, even one so historically consequential as the Corolla, caused huge sales spikes.\n\n7. Chevrolet Silverado: 41,643 sales, down 7 per cent\n\nCanada\u2019s pickup truck leaders are on the rise, but GM\u2019s new-for-2019 pickup trucks are falling well short of 2018\u2019s output. The pickup truck business, of course, isn\u2019t just loyalty-driven. It\u2019s also motivated by a constant incentive war; one prolonged battle that seemingly knows no end.\n\nEach of Canada\u2019s three major truck-sellers attempts to find a balance between demand, rebates, profits, and volume. At the moment, the new Silverado\u2019s balance is clearly shifted away from the volume component.\n\n6. GMC Sierra: 41,976 sales, down 7 per cent\n\nGM\u2019s pickup truck duo, this Sierra and its Chevrolet Silverado twin, are on track to fall to a three-year low as Canada\u2019s two top-selling pickups grab ever more market share.\n\nIt\u2019s only realistic to appraise the trucks as one, though GM sells two distinct models: the Sierra and Silverado combined for 83,619 total sales in 2019\u2019s first three-quarters, clearly more than enough to rank second on this list. But the duo has seen GM\u2019s market share in Canada\u2019s full-size truck market fall below 30 per cent in 2019, the company\u2019s lowest since 2016.\n\n5. Honda CR-V: 43,464 sales, up 2 per cent\n\nThe Honda CR-V remains a frequent comparison-test winner in spite of newer competition. In the marketplace, however, the CR-V is not able to keep pace with the newer, more overtly stylish fifth-gen Toyota RAV4, which is now outselling the CR-V by a 14-per-cent margin.\n\nGranted, the RAV4 seems to be doing the CR-V no harm. Sales of Honda\u2019s top-selling utility vehicle are on track in 2019 to hit record levels for a 10th consecutive year.\n\n4. Toyota RAV4: 49,473 sales, up 21 per cent\n\nIn 2013, Canadian sales of the Canadian-built Toyota RAV4 were surging. Over the span of just two years, a new RAV4 had caused sales to jump by more than 50 per cent. It sounds impressive, yet the overall tallies now seem decidedly unimpressive. Toyota sold 33,156 RAV4s in Canada in 2013. The company is on track in 2019 to sell twice that many.\n\n3. Honda Civic: 49,601 sales, down 12 per cent\n\nIt\u2019s Canada\u2019s car; the Canadian-built favourite for 5,500 customers every month. But Civic volume is fading as the current 10th-gen car enters its fifth model year. Civic volume is actually slowing at a faster rate than the overall passenger car market\u2019s slide. At the current rate of decline, 2019 will be the Civic\u2019s worst sales year since 2011.\n\nIt all sounds quite disastrous until you realize, even in this decline, 2019 will be the 22nd consecutive year in which the Civic is Canada\u2019s top-selling car.\n\n2. Ram P/U: 75,324 sales, up 11 per cent\n\nThe Ram is back. FCA\u2019s pickup saw its full-size market share take a hit during a topsy-turvy launch of an all-new truck, but Ram sales are now surging. Boosted by a lineup that still includes the old, affordably priced Ram Classic, which stickers for 20 per cent less than the new Ram 1500, Ram\u2019s share of the full-size truck market is now above 26 per cent. That\u2019s higher than it was even when Ram sales hit record highs in 2017.\n\n1. Ford F-Series: 117,042 sales, up 1 per cent\n\nYou might not be a gambler, but you can place a pretty safe bet on the fact the Ford F-Series will be Canada\u2019s No. 1-ranked vehicle at the end of 2019. In fact, that would have been a safe bet to place before the clock struck 12 on New Year\u2019s Eve in 2018. 2019 will be the 11th consecutive year in which the F-Series claims the top spot.\n\nIn its own pickup truck sector, Ford\u2019s sales leadership position is unquestioned. The second- and third-ranked trucks combined outsell the F-Series by only 258 units in 2019\u2019s first nine months.", "description": "These trucks, cars and crossovers make up one in every three new car sales in Canada \u2013 do you own one?", "authors": ["Hours Ago"], "top_image": "https://postmediadriving.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/dsc_4421.jpeg?quality=80", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
