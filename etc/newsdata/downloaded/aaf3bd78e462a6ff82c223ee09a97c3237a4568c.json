If the House votes tonight for an early general election, my tenure as speaker and MP will end when this Parliament ends.\n\n\"If the House does not so vote, I have concluded that the least disruptive and most democratic course of action would be for me to stand down at the close of business on Thursday, October 31.\"\n\nWATCH: Speaker Bercow's greatest moments\n\nRead more: Boris Johnson could soon be forced to resign as prime minister and make way for Jeremy Corbyn\n\nBercow announced his plan after Conservatives confirmed that they would stand against him at the general election.\n\nBy convention, the speaker is normally not challenged in elections.\n\nHowever, Bercow has become a target for Boris Johnson's government after repeatedly intervening in favour of moves by opposition members of Parliament who wish to prevent a no-deal Brexit.\n\nWatch Bercow's emotional resignation speech:\n\nBercow told MPs he would continue to act as \"the backbenchers' backstop\" before he stands down.\n\nJohnson has moved to suspend Parliament starting Monday evening for the longest period in the modern era, in what opponents have dubbed an \"undemocratic\" move by the government.\n\nBefore the suspension, MPs will vote on whether to grant the prime minister's request for a general election on October 15.\n\nOpposition parties agreed last week that they would refuse the request, meaning Bercow is set to remain as speaker until the end of October.\n\nBercow received praise for his time as speaker from across the House.\n\n\"This Parliament is the stronger for your being speaker, our democracy is the stronger for your being the speaker, and whatever you do when you finally step down from Parliament, you do so with the thanks of a very large number of people,\" Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party leader, told him.\n\nMichael Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, endorsed Corbyn's comments.\n\n\"It's been clear to everyone who has seen you work as a diligent constituency MP, as an effective backbencher, and also as a tenacious frontbencher in your time that you love this House of Commons, you love our democracy, and your commitment to your principles and to your constituents is unwavering and an example to others,\" he said.\n\nHe added: \"However controversial the role of backstop may be in other areas, your role as the backbenchers' backstop has certainly been one that's been appreciated by individuals across this House.\"", "description": "The House of Commons Speaker John Bercow said he would stand down by October 31.", "authors": ["Adam Bienkov", "Thomas Colson"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c90a908e0575a17eb1f1dc3-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
