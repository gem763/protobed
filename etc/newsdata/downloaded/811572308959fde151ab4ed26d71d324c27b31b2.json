But he stands apart, at least among modern American presidents, for his willingness to tacitly encourage it among his supporters. It\u2019s been a staple of his ascent to national power: Trump regularly urged attendees and security personnel to treat protesters roughly when ejecting them from his rallies, even offering to pay for lawyers if they were arrested for it. \u201cIf you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you?\u201d he remarked at one event. \u201cSeriously, okay. Just knock the hell\u2014I promise you I will pay for the legal fees, I promise.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks broke the usual taboo in healthy democratic societies that violence is an illegitimate form of political expression. In August of 2016, he warned rally-goers that if Clinton appointed federal judges there would be \u201cnothing you can do, folks,\u201d then added, \u201calthough the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don\u2019t know.\u201d In August, ABC News reported that it had found 36 criminal cases nationwide where Trump\u2019s name was invoked by defendants who committed or threatened to commit violent acts. The network said it found no state or federal cases where defendants claimed they acted in the name of Barack Obama or George W. Bush.\n\nConservative media outlets, for their part, have spent the last three years focused on the supposed threat posed by Antifa. The decentralized anti-fascist movement emerged after Trump\u2019s election as a response to the public resurgence of white-nationalist groups. Its masked members often hold counter-protests against far-right demonstrations. They regularly confront their perceived opponents with physical force, ranging from thrown milkshakes to assault and battery. Some white nationalists attribute their movement\u2019s faltering momentum to the left-wing protests. \u201cAntifa is winning,\u201d Richard Spencer told supporters this year after his college campus tour fell apart.\n\nWhile Antifa\u2019s actions in recent years are dwarfed by the ever-increasing catalog of far-right violence, they receive a disproportionate share of attention from conservatives. Texas Senator Ted Cruz introduced a non-binding resolution in July that would brand Antifa members as domestic terrorists. White House adviser Kellyanne Conway falsely claimed in August that \u201cAntifa\u201d was shorthand for \u201canti-First Amendment.\u201d BuzzFeed\u2019s Joe Bernstein recently noted that \u201ca search for \u2018Antifa\u2019 on Fox News\u2019 website from November 2016 to the present returns 668 results, while \u2018homelessness\u2019 returns 587, and \u2018OxyContin,\u2019 140.\u201d Though Antifa \u201chas no record of lethal violence in this country,\u201d Bernstein said the group \u201chas been skillfully transmogrified by the conservative media into one of the gravest threats facing Americans in 2019\u2014the rampant id of an already irrational left.\u201d\n\nConservative leaders and outlets often downplay massacres and other acts of violence committed by the far right.\n\nAt the same time, conservative leaders and outlets often downplay massacres and other acts of violence committed by the far right. Rush Limbaugh theorized that a gunman who broadcast himself killing 51 Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand, earlier this year supported the Green New Deal. Limbaugh, Lou Dobbs, Dinesh D\u2019Souza, and other conservatives initially responded to Sayoc\u2019s pipe bombing plot by suggesting it was a \u201cfake news\u201d hoax or that Democrats were actually responsible. House Republican lawmakers invited conservative activist Candace Owens to appear before a congressional hearing on white nationalism last month, where she testified that \u201cwhite supremacy and white nationalism is not a problem that is harming black America.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the best example came in August, after a white nationalist murdered 22 people at an El Paso Walmart in what his manifesto described as an attempt to prevent a \u201cHispanic invasion of the United States.\u201d Days later, Fox News host Tucker Carlson dismissed the threat of white supremacy as \u201cnot a real problem\u201d and a \u201choax\u201d created by the left. \u201cJust like the Russia hoax, it\u2019s a conspiracy theory used to divide the country and keep a hold on power,\u201d he warned viewers. Carlson\u2019s claim is particularly audacious, given that he might be one of the most prominent distributors of white-nationalist views in America today.\n\n\n\nThe resulting narrative is not hard to piece together. Americans who get almost all of their news from Fox News and other right-wing outlets are receiving a disturbing set of messages: that Democrats have brought the country to the brink of civil war, that speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi\u2019s effort to impeach the president is an illegitimate coup, and that liberals\u2019 open-borders policies will make it impossible for Republicans to win future elections. Far-right massacres are actually leftist hoaxes, but Antifa will bludgeon any conservatives who dissent into submission. Thankfully, the overwhelming majority of Trump supporters won\u2019t respond to this by picking up a rifle. But it seems almost inevitable that some will.\n\nLike many people who commit mass murder, McVeigh later argued that he hadn\u2019t fired the first shot. The bombing, he explained, was revenge for the government\u2019s suppression of far-right militias at Ruby Ridge and Waco. McVeigh said he initially planned a campaign of assassinations by targeting Attorney General Janet Reno, a federal judge, and an FBI sniper who was present at Ruby Ridge, but ultimately decided to strike a more symbolic target instead. \u201cForemost,\u201d he wrote in a letter to reporters shortly before his execution, \u201cthe bombing was a retaliatory strike; a counter attack, for the cumulative raids (and subsequent violence and damage) that federal agents had participated in over the preceding years.\u201d\n\nThere is little chance that the FBI or the Justice Department will heed the president\u2019s demand to arrest and jail California Representative Adam Schiff for \u201ctreason\u201d and \u201cfraud.\u201d But there\u2019s a very real chance that a handful of Trump\u2019s supporters will decide that violence is the only appropriate response and act accordingly. The specter of potential violence shouldn\u2019t deter lawmakers from pushing forward with the impeachment process. If anything, it underscores why Trump\u2019s impeachment is a moral imperative.", "description": "\"Civil war\" rhetoric is not uncommon on the fringes of American political discourse.
