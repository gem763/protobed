It was a weird experience, not least for the dynamic between us journalists and the royals. There are two types of royal press coverage: the official type, governed by rules set down in more deferential times, compels reporters to cover the royal family while abiding by a strict set of protocols; the unofficial type, often written by the same people in the same publications, serves as a kind of release mechanism for resentment generated by the former. The country\u2019s entire push-me-pull-you relationship with the royals is contained within these modes of discourse, co-dependent and neither acknowledging the other.\n\nThe fact that the focus of negative coverage has been on Meghan, not Harry, doesn\u2019t smell quite right\n\nI thought about this last week in connection with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the question of whether their complaints about the press are justified. On the couple\u2019s recent tour of southern Africa, Harry told off a reporter from Sky News for asking a question \u2013 a benign inquiry about what he hoped to achieve that broke protocol for being \u201cunscheduled\u201d \u2013 as he left a health centre in Malawi. \u201cRhiannon, don\u2019t behave like this,\u201d he said, while an aide practically threw her body between them. The prince looked like his father in that moment \u2013 sour and petulant, undeserving \u2013 and it was easy to imagine getting from there to a sentence starting \u201cHey, asshole\u201d and ending with \u201cwe pay your salary\u201d.\n\nStill, when the ITV documentary ran, I felt sorry for the couple. The argument that if you put yourself in the public eye you deserve everything you get seems as disingenuous as the royals\u2019 assumption of deference. Neither permits those on the other side to be fully human; both are grounded in resentment and something else, a reflex that seems to me like the satisfaction people get from telling smokers they can\u2019t be treated on the NHS or that poor people shouldn\u2019t buy luxuries. Nothing boosts the serotonin like a little light hatred as long as it can be justified as morally superior.\n\nPlay Video 'It's hard': Meghan says friends warned her not to marry Harry because of British tabloids \u2013 video\n\nWhich isn\u2019t to say we can\u2019t criticise them. Negative coverage of Harry and Meghan divides between legitimate inquiries about whether people who travel by private jet can lecture the rest of us about the environment, prurient stuff relating to Meghan\u2019s dad and increasingly loopy coverage featuring \u201cbody language experts\u201d and speculations about Harry\u2019s fragile mental state. Jan Moir, discovering a sudden affinity with \u201cluckless Africans\u201d, argued in the Mail that it was wildly inappropriate for this wealthy couple to complain about their lot with Angola as a backdrop. This might well be the case, but one assumes their complaints would have been equally poorly received had they been issued from St James\u2019s Palace.\n\nOf course, the fact that the focus of negative coverage has been on Meghan, not Harry, doesn\u2019t smell quite right. Some of this is evidently to do with race. But there is also a class factor: who does she think she is, trying to exert PR control over royal coverage? My dear, that might wash in Hollywood, but not here. Meghan has a five-month-old baby boy at home, which can be a rough emotional time no matter how big your house is, but that doesn\u2019t excuse her failure to grasp a simple, plangent truth: that while tugging our forelocks, the British like to knee our royals in the groin as we mutter to ourselves, \u201cthey asked for it\u201d.\n\n\u2022 Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist", "description": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have had a rough time with the media \u2013 but to many people it\u2019s a bit rich to complain about their treatment, says Guardian columnist Emma Brockes", "authors": ["Emma Brockes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d3d0de400aa43b132d6aad2c410cb240ab652c8/0_100_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=dea9725d2d0e7753cabbd4f8d8daf407", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
