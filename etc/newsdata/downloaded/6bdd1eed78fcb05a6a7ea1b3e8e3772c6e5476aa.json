In November four of Europe\u2019s Galileo navigation satellites blasted into orbit on board an Ariane 5, taking the total number of satellites to 18 and signaling the start of services from the EU\u2019s equivalent to GPS.\n\nMeanwhile the private space startups were busy perfecting their re-usable rocket technology. Elon Musk\u2019s Space X failed, tried again, and nailed it in April with a perfect touchdown of a rocket on a floating barge.\n\nIn Texas the space company Blue Origin launched successive New Shepard rockets, including a capsule escape test, complete with perfect touchdown by the main booster.\n\nThe firm founded by Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos believes re-usable rockets can radically drive down the cost of access to space.\n\nAnother space entrepreneur, Richard Branson, watched his Virgin Galactic VSS Unity space plane make its first untethered flight and landing, another step towards making space tourism a reality.\n\nMeanwhile we sent some spacecraft out to meet the neighbours in 2016, with Europe and Russia going to Mars, and the Americans to Jupiter.\n\nThere was drama in Darmstadt, Germany at ESA\u2019s operations centre in October, as the Schiaparelli probe, which should have demonstrated that Europe can land on our neighbouring planet, crashed into the surface at 300km/h.\n\nMuch was learned during the descent, but what should have been a celebratory moment turned into disappointment\n\nHowever ExoMars goes on, as the Trace Gas Orbiter went into orbit around the planet and began sending back scientific data, beginning the search for methane in the atmosphere, and furthering the hunt for life on Mars.\n\nThere were happier scenes at NASA as Juno entered orbit around Jupiter in July, although since then that spacecraft has also been prone to problems, and is now in a much longer orbit around the gas giant than scientists had hoped. However, it has sent back some unprecedented views of the planet that dominates our solar system.\n\nFour hundred kilometres above our heads the International Space Station had another busy year as mankind\u2019s main orbital research outpost.\n\nBritish ESA astronaut Tim Peake came down from his stint in space, and French ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet went up for a six month stay, alongside astronaut colleagues from the US, Russia and Japan.\n\nThey were sent greetings in this video message from two Chinese taikonauts, temporary residents of China\u2019s new space station this autumn. A new space power in the east is emerging.\n\nHowever the mission that captured everyone\u2019s imagination came to a close in September. Rosetta slowly and deliberately crashed into the comet it had been following since 2014, a bittersweet end of mission finale to a space adventure which has come to define mankind\u2019s quest to dare to explore space, and share the adventure.\n\nFinally our review of the year pays tribute to astronaut John Glenn, who died on December 8th aged 95. The first American to orbit the Earth in February 1962, he later went back into space on board the space shuttle, aged 77.", "description": "Space exploration saw some highs and lows in 2016.", "authors": ["Robert Hackwill"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/352561/1000x563_352561.jpg", "published_at": "2016-12-31"}
