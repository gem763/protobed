We had three months to put it together \u2013 it was such an incredible experience. The dress was made from tulle with Perspex shards, so it looked like a mirrored body piece, with a massive matching train. I got to decide the shape and the colour \u2013 I felt as if I had total control of the final look, which was really important to me. As a model, it\u2019s not something I often experience, so I felt really grateful.\n\nPutting on the dress was a true struggle; it took about 30 minutes. We didn\u2019t account for the body piece being so heavy and, because it was covered in the Perspex shards, it was quite painful to do it up. Once the dress was on, I couldn\u2019t go to the toilet and I had to do my hair and makeup wearing it, but it was so much fun. Rami had to take the dress back after I had worn it because I couldn\u2019t travel with it \u2013 and there is no space for even a bra in my room where I live, let alone a ballgown. But once I get my new house, I am definitely requesting it back.\n\nWhat people don\u2019t know is that when you are on the red carpet, it\u2019s very intimidating. Photographers are shouting at you to get your attention, so you are turning around, but then your dress gets all wrapped around your legs. They are still taking pictures and you just have to hold it together. When you watch videos of a red carpet event, they put lovely music over it and it looks really relaxed, but it\u2019s not like that in reality: there is no music.\n\nI like playing around with my look and making a statement. I don\u2019t like to play it safe, but my day-to-day style can really vary: sometimes I feel very preppy and I might wear vintage Ralph Lauren, other days I want to be comfortable and cosy, and I will wear my own sportswear brand, Lapp. Sometimes I want to be glamorous and that\u2019s when I have fun on the red carpet, go all out and think of something really dramatic to wear.", "description": "The model talks about the tulle and Perspex dress she helped design for a Cannes premiere, and how the red carpet can be surprisingly intimidating", "authors": ["Leah Harper", "As Told To"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e04118645ca868843709384594aa0e9a5c76294/0_237_5298_3179/master/5298.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=be792b4e16dc96b0ad38abadc3f95bf6", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
