Poet Anne Carson and actor Stephen Dillane move through the world on an imaginary day, as the sun is eclipsed. Set in multiple locations and weathers (Bodmin Moor, Yellowstone Park, Wyoming and Illinois), and with innovative technical manipulations (the entire film was edited in-camera), atmospheres and startling imagery, the whole thing is a delight. AS\n\nRead the review.\n\n24 Andreas Gursky\n\nAmazon (2016)\n\nAndreas Gursky makes photographs but not as we know them. The scale of his composite digital images is vast, their detail hyperreal. He is the photographic artist of our time, whether capturing the frenzied activity of the Chicago stock exchange or a painterly vista of the Rhine \u2013 a manipulated landscape that does not exist in real life. The extraordinary Amazon offers a glimpse of a single day\u2019s orders stacked in a giant warehouse. A glimpse of the scale, if not the labour, of 21st-century global commerce.

In 2000, she advertised online \u2013 using a brutal, shaven-headed and naked photograph of herself \u2013 for a husband with an EU Passport. Eventually she met and married a German in a performance in Belgrade. With him, she moved to D\u00fcsseldorf. Later, the couple celebrated their divorce. A prescient exploration of how human transactions are conducted online, and using EU law as an artistic medium. AS\n\n22 Steve McQueen\n\nIlluminer (2001)\n\nLit only by the flickering light of a television programme about US navy seals deployed in Aghanistan, McQueen thrashes on his hotel bed, illuminated by violence, the soundtrack erupting with noise. His camera, on top of the telly, watches him struggling in the gloom. Little more than a filmed sketch, a situation grasped, Illuminer nevertheless has everything, and is a lesson in being able to make work anywhere, anytime. AS\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cool liquid quality ... Freischwimmer. Photograph: Wolfgang Tillmans\n\n21 Wolfgang Tillmans\n\nFreischwimmer (2003-present)\n\nHumans have made pictures for millennia \u2013 why get hung up on how they are made? So asks Wolfgang Tillmans. Soon after becoming the first photographer to win the Turner prize in 2000, Tillmans started experimenting with picture-making that skipped camera, negative and subject, produced by exposing photographic paper to handheld light sources in the darkroom. The Freischwimmer series has a cool liquid quality: vast prints apparently depicting tiny dots of coloured liquid tumbling and trailing through water. In fact they are images of nothing more than their own production: oddly honest for an age in which you can seldom trust your eyes.

An exercise in power, this work is as much sculptural as it is a performance, or an equestrian ballet. The smell of the horses, their scale in a contained space, the often unspoken marshalling, the uncertainty of whether you are audience or subject: the Cuban artist regards this 2008 performance as a vignette, but it is so much more.

The pantyhose feet droop, midair. The lights are a sign of life. Whether hanged or floating, dangling or soaring, Lucas\u2019s figure is full of pathos and humour, both miserable and transcendent. Her sense of materiality, and fragility, is pitch-perfect here.

Photograph: Thomas Lohnes/AFP/Getty Images\n\n17 Ai Weiwei\n\nFairytale (2007)\n\nOnce upon a time, Beijing\u2019s mighty Prince of Protest was invited by the burghers of Kassel to display his art at a quinquennial exhibition thought the finest in any land. This prince, well versed in new philosophies, set aside painting and video art and decreed the exhibition a social laboratory. One thousand and one citizens of China would travel by his side as both audience and exhibit. And the prince constructed a great dormitory, matching wheelie suitcases and coloured bracelets, that by these tokens the citizens of Kassel might know the citizens of China, and welcome them. And all lived happily ever after (apart from the Prince of Protest, who was arrested four years later and imprisoned for 81 days by his own government). HJ\n\n16 Chris Ofili\n\nThe Upper Room (2002)\n\nThis cycle of 14 paintings, all based on an Andy Warhol sketch of a monkey, and assembled in a specially constructed and lit room in collaboration with architect David Atjaye, was a breakthrough work for Chris Ofili. Tate\u2019s purchase of the work proved controversial, but it would probably have been split up otherwise. With its drifts of glitter, its gorgeous colour and detail, its humour and elephant dung, it pointed the way to an expansive, immersive narrative approach Ofili has continued to develop. I was astonished. AS\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Conceptually intense ... How Not to Be Seen. Photograph: Hito Steyerl, courtesy of the artist and Andrew Kreps Gallery, New York\n\n15 Hito Steyerl\n\nHow Not to Be Seen: A Fucking Didactic Educational .MOV File (2013)\n\nStarting with the basic, pressing question of how to evade surveillance in a world read through moving images, Hito Steyerl\u2019s influential video picks apart what it means to disappear. If surveillance feels grossly invasive, how do we feel about the invisibility afforded to the vastly wealthy? What about the invisibility bestowed by a burqa, systemic bigotry, or extraordinary rendition? Shot on an abandoned satellite \u201cresolution target\u201d in the California desert, How Not to Be Seen is conceptually intense, but retains the daffiness of the Monty Python sketch that inspired it. An artist and theorist both, Steyerl beguiles us into contemplating uncomfortable questions with wit and charm.

Tino Sehgal\u2019s magnificent performance piece takes place in near total darkness. Performers stamp and sing, whisper, holler and dance. They go through little routines, songs and riffs as the viewer stumbles among and between them. Sometimes there is a confrontation and sometimes unnerving quiet. Wildly exhilarating, This Variation concerns presence and presentness, and what it means to be a spectator.

Birds sing, cars go by, people fold washing as she tramps back alleys and country lanes, city streets and unmade paths. Nothing happens in the film. It has already happened, in bucolic villages and city side-streets. The film lasts a long time, dwelling on the past\u2019s persistence in the present. The camera is unwavering as the world turns, oblivious.

Talent meets talent, words meet images and postwar England meets its wisest cultural thinker in this wonderfully deft work. Using more than 800 hours of audio and TV material from Hall\u2019s own archive, Akomfrah takes us from Hall\u2019s Jamaican childhood to a grey postwar London. But the real concern is the malleability of identities, how we are formed and the endless task of reinventing ourselves.

Eliasson\u2019s hallucinatory installation in the Tate Turbine Hall had people lying on the floor, mellowing out to his shimmering recreation of a Turneresque sky inside the museum. He would be very good at staging a Pink Floyd reunion. But in fact he is a very thoughtful artist, fascinated by colour, light and the fragile state of nature. This unforgettable spectacle was the most over-the-top in a string of dazzling installations and interventions that have proved Elisasson one of the century\u2019s most significant artists.

The painting is as small as the TV screens people were glued to that day. The image is interrupted, almost swiped away by paint, recognising the impossibility of comprehending the enormity of the moment.

It zigzagged down the ramp like a small canyon, or the remains of an earthquake. Shibboleth evoked division, a flaw. \u201cIt represents borders, the experience of immigrants, the experience of segregation, the experience of racial hatred,\u201d Salcedo said. \u201cThe space which illegal immigrants occupy is a negative space.

Using puppets \u2013 some extremely old, many made in clay or Murano glass \u2013 Shawky delights, ravishes and informs at every turn. It is hard to keep up with all the shenanigans between Shia and Sunni, and the duplicitous divisions and squabbles of the Christian invaders, regarded by Arab commentators of the time as uncivilised barbarians.

But few will have seen the entire work, with its approximately 12,000 cinema clips spanning its 24-hour entirety. A tour-de-force of borrowed movie footage, The Clock is cinema\u2019s great timepiece, always synchronised to the real time wherever it is shown. Following the diurnal rhythms of everyday life, it is by turns perky, sexy, conspiratorial, manic, exhausted and sullen. Knowing it is there is almost enough.

(2009)\n\nOnce a day, a young man mopped the floors and steps of a Venetian Palazzo with rags soaked in the blood of victims of Mexican violence and murder. Teresa Margolles\u2019s Limpieza (Cleaning), part of her larger work at the Mexico Pavilion at the 2009 Venice Biennale, was both an everyday routine and a bleak response to both state and criminal violence. Both washing and sullying the floors, Limpieza was emphatic, unforgettable, tragic and tender. AS\n\n4 Pussy Riot\n\nPunk Prayer (2012)\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of weak political art out there: sophisticated, modish, after-the-factish art that broadcasts liberal values to a liberal audience. Pussy Riot\u2019s performance of Punk Prayer occupies the opposite pole: feminist, explicitly anti-Putin, protesting the banning of gay pride and the Orthodox church\u2019s support of the president. Staged by the brightly masked punk collective in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow, it got members Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina arrested and imprisoned. The after-image of their performance still lingers as a powerful \u2013 and immaculately constructed \u2013 symbol of defiance in the face of freedoms lost.

Among great stands of nettles, strange plants of all descriptions flourished: nightshade and Afghan poppies, aphrodisiacs, poisons and psychotropic plants. In a clearing beside a pond sat a bronze statue of a reclining woman whose head was a living nest of bees. Two lithe greyhounds, one of whom had a leg that had been dyed pink, wandered about. \u201cLive things and inanimate things, made and not made,\u201d read Huyghe\u2019s description of this wondrous work.

In portraying a brutal clash between pickets and police in South Yorkshire during the miners\u2019 strikes in 1984-5, Deller instead chose to approach this horrifying confrontation from the field up. Battle of Orgreave, described by the artist as \u201ca thousand-person crime re-enactment\u201d, was staged by 800 historical re-enacters and 200 former miners. For all of them, the event was in living memory. A monument of sorts, the performance was at once participatory ritual, spectacle, living archive and a space to mourn.

Photograph: Courtesy of the artist, Luhring Augustine, New York and i8 Gallery, Reykjavi\u0301k\n\n1 Ragnar Kjartansson\n\nThe Visitors (2012)\n\nFilmed at Rokeby Farm, a grand dilapidated house once owned by the Astor family in upstate New York, The Visitors is a nine-channel video in which the Icelandic artist and his friends, including members of Sigur R\u00f3s, sing and play a song whose lyrics were written by Kjartansson\u2019s ex-wife, \u00c1sd\u00eds Sif Gunnarsd\u00f3ttir. Ragnar understood her lyrics as a commentary on what he calls the \u201ccommon defeat\u201d of their marriage. The music was co-written by Kjartansson and his frequent collaborator Dav\u00ed\u00f0 \u00de\u00f3r J\u00f3nsson.\n\nThe maddest house party ever \u2013 Ragnar Kjartansson on making The Visitors Read more\n\nThe artist\u2019s friends play different parts of the same song, which repeats over and over, for more than an hour. A pair of twins play concertina and cello in different rooms \u2013 all the musicians were audible to one another through headphones. There are two pianists, a guitarist, drums. The Visitors is a live performance, each musician visible on a different screen. Outside, there is a party on the porch, where the house\u2019s current occupants take in the early evening. Captured in real time, one evening at sunset, the music builds and dies and builds again. The song repeats and develops, reaches false crescendos and plateaus. Ragnar, in the bath, is nearly submerged in soap bubbles as he sings, \u201cOnce again I\u2019m falling into my feminine ways.\u201d \u201cThere are stars exploding around you / And there is nothing / Nothing you can do,\u201d goes another refrain, in this idyllic crumbling retreat. You get sucked in.\n\nYou feel like a guest yourself in this marvellous, immersive multiscreen film. The more often I see it, the more I come to inhabit its rooms. Why is it so compelling and, with its repetitions, so watchable multiple times? The fragility of friendship and love, communality and miscommunication all have a part here.\n\nThe title of the work is taken from Abba\u2019s final album, when the band were falling apart. The film\u2019s absurdities and longeurs, the light, and the concentration of all the performers and the repetition of the song is utterly compelling and hypnotic. Youthfulness and idealism feel like a fading dream in the evening\u2019s light. The Visitors is a kind of extended farewell to romanticism, to which Ragnar is both drawn and deeply suspicious of. Writing this, I want to see The Visitors again, immediately.
