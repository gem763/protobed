( ORCL ) made a corporate announcement Wednesday that one of its two chief executives, Mark Hurd, will take a medical leave. The stock is down sharply Thursday, so a fresh look at the charts and indicators seems in order.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of ORCL, below, we can see that prices are off about 5% and closer to the rising 200-day moving average line than it was yesterday. The slope of the 50-day moving average line is negative. The On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line was inching higher this month, but Thursday's action may reverse that movement.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is pointed up towards the zero-line, but if Thursday's weakness continues, we could see a reversal of that action, too.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of ORCL, below, we do not have Thursday's price action included and we will actually need to see Friday's close to figure it out. It's possible we could see a test of the 40-week moving average line and have the OBV line turn lower.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of ORCL, below, we can see the recent decline (column of \"O's\"), but there is still an upside price target of $64 projected. A trade at $51.02 is probably needed to weaken this chart.\n\nBottom line strategy: I don't know if this corporate news is a game changer but a sell stop just below $51 looks like a good idea right now.", "description": "Following company news, a sell stop just below $51 looks like a good idea right now....ORCL", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Sage Advice", "Tighten Stops For Oracle", "Following Company News", "A Sell Stop Just Below", "Looks Like A Good Idea Right Now.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Eric Jhonsa"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/c28337f8-11a7-11e8-addd-d5e32ecc02f6.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
