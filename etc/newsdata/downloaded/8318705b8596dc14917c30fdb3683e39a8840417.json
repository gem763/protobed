Where were the legs?\"\n\nSilva, 33, is due to leave the club at the end of this season, with his status as one of City's greatest ever players guaranteed.\n\nHowever, he and his team-mates have a lot of work ahead of them if he is to follow in Vincent Kompany's footsteps by ending his time at the club as a Premier League champion.", "description": "The manager had tried to rein in his rants at players but club legend was reportedly on the end of a talking to", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Getty", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19003615.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_AFC-Bournemouth-v-Manchester-City-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
