But it has been a massive slide since - with Manchester United struggling and looking lost for ideas.\n\nSunday's dismal 1-0 defeat at Newcastle United piled more misery on United, who sit in 12th position in the real Premier League table, just two points above the drop zone.\n\nAP\n\nSince signing a three year contact back in March, United's only league victories have come against Watford and West Ham at the tail end of last season, and Chelsea and Leicester in the early weeks of this one.\n\nThe new Premier League season is only eight matches in, and Manchester Unite are already 15 points behind leaders Liverpool. They are not only having a goal drought, but failing to win a game away from home.\n\nTheir disastrous start and depressing state can be better understood by looking at the points table - they sit in 12th spot, but are shockingly yet deservedly two points above the relegation places.\n\nMEN\n\nThat in itself is a catastrophic decline and pronounced misery that keeps on giving every week. It makes for a fascinating tale of 'how the mighty have fallen.'\n\nThe once great Manchester United that had opponents in fear and trembling even before the ball was kicked, are anything but that these days, and no team in the land has any qualms about facing them.\n\nThe dark clouds over Manchester United continue to grow darker, and the club continues to decline to new levels every week. The gap between them, and clubs like Manchester City and Liverpool is so monumental that you can fit in the entire population of China.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe players are in oblivion and look like robots walking the green pitches in Unite Kingdom. The forwards can't seem to score goals and defense is still unstable and unconvincing.\n\nThe injuries to many first team players hasn't helped either, not that they would have had any impact, but they look short of quite a few players in the squad.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, is on the rocks and faces a massive next month or so, but the performances on the pitch have been so dreadful that it's hard to see any magical turnaround.\n\nFor now, me and millions of Manchester United fans like me, can rely only on Netflix for entertainment, for there's nothing to watch on the pitch.\n\nThe times are tough, really tough.", "description": "After the famous night in Paris when Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r masterminded Manchester United's 3-3 aggregate win on away goals, the Norwegian was give the permanent manager's job by the record 20 time English champions.
