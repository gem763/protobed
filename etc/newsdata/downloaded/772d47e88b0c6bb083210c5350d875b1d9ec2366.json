That\u2019s still down from the average 18.8 million viewers of 2015, which many pundits speculate might have been the peak, with cord-cutting growing and more competition for eyeballs than ever before.\n\nBut even if NFL ratings have peaked, the league still pulls more viewership than anything else on live television\u2014and it isn\u2019t close. Of the top 100 live broadcasts in 2018, 64 were NFL games.\n\nThose are the kind of stats league executives will bring to the table in the imminent negotiations with networks (and with streaming players like Amazon and Facebook) over how much NFL rights packages are worth.\n\n\u201cThis is the best I\u2019ve ever seen it in presenting the NFL right now,\u201d Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday. \u201cAll television has had diminished viewership; the NFL has disproportionately not had that kind of drop off. Our television is actually stronger than it has ever been. That will serve us well when we are renegotiating our agreements with all the networks.\u201d\n\nThe league will surely end up getting more money from its new TV contracts than it did last time around\u2014that\u2019s how these renewals work. So, how much more?\n\nJones thinks the NFL could get 50% more.\n\nWhy? The tide of sports betting legalization. In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the federal ban on sports betting, leaving states free to legalize sports betting in their own state. Ten states did so, joining Nevada, which already had it. There is now some form of legal sports betting in: Nevada; New Jersey; New York; Delaware; Mississippi; West Virginia; Pennsylvania; Rhode Island; Indiana; Iowa; and Arkansas.\n\nDallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones welcomes fans to his team's opening practice at the NFL football team's training camp in Oxnard, Calif., Saturday, July 27, 2019.

The viewership is where our numbers will increase. People will stay longer. That value is how our sport will benefit from gaming. I dare say that gaming will increase the value of television, of presenting our games, I dare say it will go up 50% because of the gaming concentration.\u201d\n\nOf course, Jones is talking his book. Of course an NFL team owner is bullish on NFL broadcast rights, and thinks the NFL should get paid much more for its games than in the past.\n\nBut Jones is referencing a popular truism: that people watch more games when they bet on those games. (Fantasy sports operators like DraftKings and FanDuel make the same argument: that fantasy football is good for viewership.) Numerous surveys support that. Americans are more likely to watch a sports event if they have financial skin in the game.\n\nThat means the current momentum of sports betting legalization in America is hypothetically good for the NFL, and by extension, good for NFL viewership.\n\nStill, a 50% spike is quite a stretch. The NFL currently brings in around $5 billion per year from its TV deals; Jones is forecasting that could rise to $7.5 billion.\n\nThe media world won\u2019t have to wait long to find out if he\u2019s right\u2014last time around, the league announced its new deals in 2011, two years before they had been set to expire. That means we could see the new contracts hammered out as soon as 2020.\n\n\u2014\n\nDaniel Roberts is the sports business writer at Yahoo Finance.
