The program is organized in partnership with Eurochocolate, an annual chocolate festival that takes place in Perugia, Italy.\n\nAlso on the itinerary is a shore excursion to the Chocolate Museum of Barcelona, which traces the history of chocolate and features a model of the city's famous Parc Guell, in chocolate form.\n\nThe Eurochocolate Cruise departs April 16.\n\nPrincess Cruises also developed a \"Chocolate Journeys\" program with chocolatier Norman Love, whose chocolate confections and desserts are served in select main dining rooms across the fleet. The program also includes chocolate and wine pairing tastings and chocolate spa treatments.", "description": "Princess Cruises also developed a \"Chocolate Journeys\" program with chocolatier Norman Love, whose chocolate confections and desserts are served in select main dining rooms across the fleet.
