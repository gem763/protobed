The actor was photographed this week in New York, where she was likely promoting Bombshell, a film about the Fox News harassment scandal in which she plays Megyn Kelley.\n\nPhoto: TheStewartofNY/GC Images\n\nThe bowl cut has grown little bit since we last saw it, evoking a sort of shaggy, second-grade-boy-chic in this recent appearance. The initial chop, which Theron got for The Fate of the Furious (a.k.a. Fast 8), was sharper and darker, a look my colleague Marie Lodi described as \u201cChynna Phillips in the music video for Wilson Phillips\u2019s \u201cHold On\u201d meets Minkus from Boy Meets World.\u201d\n\nThe lightened look is more approachable, maybe even something that a person who doesn\u2019t look like Charlize Theron could try out with limited trauma. After all, between Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\u2019s dignified bowl in The King, and the ubiquity of the style on social media, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if it\u2019s here to stay for awhile.", "description": "Charlize Theron was spotted with a blonde bowl cut while doing press for the film Bombshell in New York.", "authors": ["Sangeeta Singh-Kurtz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/25/25-charlize-theron-1.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
