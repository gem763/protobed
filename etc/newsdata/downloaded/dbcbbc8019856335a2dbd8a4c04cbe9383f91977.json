Lion Air Flight 610 crashed last October into the Java Sea, and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 went down in March after takeoff from Addis Ababa. All aboard both flights, a total of 346 people, were killed.\n\nMore problems with 737 Max: FAA inspectors weren't qualified to certify Boeing 737 Max pilots, investigation finds\n\nInvestigations found that in both crashes, pilots seemed confounded by the MCAS that repeatedly pointed the planes' noses down as they tried to keep the jets airborne. The MCAS was supposed to operate in the background and give the Max the same flying characteristics as previous generations of the 737, which first took flight in the 1960s.\n\nThe NTSB report is the latest in a series of probes and analyses arising from the crashes.\n\nThe 737 Max has been grounded since the Ethiopian crash. Boeing has been redesigning MCAS to try to make it easier for pilots to override it when needed and be able to take manual control of the aircraft more easily.\n\nThe company said it hopes for Federal Aviation Administration approval of the redesign to get the 737 Max back in the air in the last three months of 2019.\n\nThe FAA has no set timetable, and foreign aviation authorities are reviewing the changes as well.\n\nThe FAA should require Boeing to \"consider the effect of all possible flight deck\n\nalerts and indications on pilot recognition and response,\" the NTSB said Thursday in its recommendations.\n\nBoeing should make changes that minimize the chance for pilot error, the board said.\n\nThe NTSB said its recommendations shouldn't apply just to the 737 Max but also to all other commercial aircraft.\n\nThe FAA needs to \"develop design standards, with the input of industry and human factors experts, for aircraft system diagnostic tools\" that make it it easy and quick for pilots to respond, the board said.\n\nIn response to the NTSB report, the FAA and Boeing independently issued statements saying safety is their top priority and they will go over the recommendations.\n\n\"We value the role of the NTSB in promoting aviation safety. We are committed to working with the FAA in reviewing the NTSB recommendations,\u201d Boeing said.\n\nThe NTSB and air safety: Fatal NYC helicopter crash video shows passengers struggling, NTSB report says\n\nThe FAA said it continually tries to improve and pledged to correct any deficiencies arising from the crashes.\n\n\"The lessons learned from the investigations into the tragic accidents of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 will be a springboard to an even greater level of safety,\" it said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Boeing 737 Max: How FAA should fix the grounded jetliner, per NTSB", "description": "The NTSB\u00a0says the FAA should require Boeing to redesign its system\u00a0in a way that is more intuitive, so\u00a0pilots can take corrective action quickly.", "authors": ["Chris Woodyard", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JLujzfvuNKsCT2JwSEnMTg--~B/aD00NTA7dz0zNjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/1009217/681c1449-4ba1-4d4e-84b1-f5356ca5f779/59152d57-3ed9-5a61-b63d-34c8d76a1d1f/data_3_0.jpg?s=2a3648723253e5a20220bf69eee460ab&c=9ac4c38766a1e5d5a58309b9e5ee1f84&a=tripleplay4us&mr=0", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
