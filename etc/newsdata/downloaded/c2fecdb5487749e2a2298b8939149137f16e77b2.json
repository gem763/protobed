And Shayne Benowitz of The New York Post recently talked to several of these grandmillennials, who are taking d\u00e9cor inspiration everywhere from English country houses to neo-preppy brands like Rodarte and spending big bucks \u2014 think anywhere for $5,000 to $150,000 \u2014 to do it.\n\nDesign experts told both Bazilian and Benowitz that millennials are putting an updated spin on this style to show off their personal flair and create a homey feeling. The aesthetic is a response to the minimalist, neutral trends that have been reigning over Instagram, they said.\n\n\"People want design with more soul and personality,\" Brooklyn-based designer Caroline Pogue, who specializes in vintage residential interiors, told Benowitz. \"It's also fueled by a renewed interest in vintage fashion and an ethos for reusing items.\"\n\nA post shared by Emma Bazilian (@ebazilian) Sep 27, 2019 at 6:05pm PDT\n\nRead more: Houses are the new Instagram influencers \u2014 so it's a shame most millennials in the US will likely be renters for years\n\nThe grandmillennial aesthetic says a lot about what millennials like and don't like\n\nThe trend is both a contradiction of and an embodiment of what millennials love.\n\nMillennials are known for being partial to minimalist, low-maintenance designs and sleek, discreet appliances in homes, Business Insider's Katie Warren previously reported. Some even love a minimalist lifestyle so much that they prefer to live in tiny houses.\n\nThe rise of the grandmillennial is a knee-jerk, maximalist reaction to that very minimalism. However, it's also on par with the ugly fashion movement. Consumers are dropping hundreds of dollars on \"ugly fashion\" trends like Balenciaga's Triple S sneakers and Birkenstocks, Business Insider's Mary Hanbury reported.\n\nFor some millennials, more really is more: Both the \"ugly fashion\" style and grandmillennial aesthetic have \"extra,\" or lavish, tendencies, but at the end of the day, they're all about comfort.\n\nAs Bazilian wrote, \"Maybe the ultimate appeal of the grandmillennial aesthetic lies in the fact that, for the stressed-out twenty- and thirty-somethings of the world, that cozy chintz chair at your grandmother's house represents a much-needed respite.\"", "description": "Antiques, ruffles, brocade: Millennials are decorating their homes grandma-style, and it's a reaction to their generation's affinity for minimalism.", "authors": ["Hillary Hoffower"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da9dcf94af90939682aeec6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
