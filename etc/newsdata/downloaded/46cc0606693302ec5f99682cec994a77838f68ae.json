Organisations need them as workers and consumers. But no organisation has tapped into this. There is scope for a bold first-mover to pick the best fruit.\u201d Perhaps his words can be motivation for you to speak up.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of \u201cdebate\u201d at work about things that used to be easy to agree on. Stating the facts and presenting the business case used to be enough. Given this, what\u2019s the best way to construct an argument to get through? Should I be framing things as an ethical issue rather than a factual one?\n\nHow you frame an argument can certainly affect whether you can get your point across and bring people along. At work, we\u2019re accustomed to presenting arguments based on facts, financials and economic theories, but we\u2019re less practised at making moral and ethical points. Sometimes people even avoid mentioning morals and ethics out of fear they won\u2019t look commercially astute. This phenomenon is called \u201cmoral muteness\u201d, and we should watch out for it.\n\nA recent study concluded that positions better connected to harm and fairness arguments are more likely to drive opinion changes. As business leaders increasingly raise their voices about the moral and ethical issues of the day, it seems the right time to round out discussions by covering the facts as well as the moral and ethical imperatives. It will strengthen the case you\u2019re making and as they say, practice makes perfect.\n\nWhen our leadership team discusses staff matters, one of my colleagues defaults to the position that our staff care only about themselves and not the business. He says this is the reality of humans, and makes the rest of us feel naive for thinking otherwise. He also uses it to justify some pretty harsh practices. Is this the reality? Or is there more to humans than that?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis question divides people, including philosophers. It\u2019s a hard one, and the answer is that it depends what you believe. There is plenty of research to suggest we operate on more than self-interest. Studies have found we will do the right thing and help others even if it causes detriment to ourselves. Examples abound of good, selfless behaviour.\n\nUnfortunately, there are also plenty of examples of self-interested behaviour. Thomas Hobbes, the 17th-century English philosopher, held that we need to form social contracts and have governments to prevent our selfish and even violent tendencies from taking over. His view didn\u2019t go unchallenged, though, and John Locke believed humans to be inherently tolerant and reasonable.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s worth thinking about the impact of adopting a certain point of view. If you believe everyone at work is self-interested, you\u2019re likely to think the worst of them, even when they are acting with pure altruism. On the other hand, believing in the good of people is a more positive outlook and, I believe, a better way to live.\n\nDo you have an ethical dilemma at work?
