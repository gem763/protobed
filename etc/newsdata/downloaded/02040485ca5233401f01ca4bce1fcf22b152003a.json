(It grew to 80,000 just after Blevins\u2019s first victory.)\n\nMixer competes with Twitch, YouTube, and Facebook for a relatively narrow share of the livestreaming market. Yesterday, Blevins announced his move to the service, in a tweet that blew up gaming\u2019s corner of the internet; he was leaving behind 14.7 million followers on Twitch, and striking out for a service that, comparatively, nobody knew much about. Blevins is probably the most famous streamer in the world; the fact of his leaving Twitch, which dominates livestreaming, was a very big deal.\n\nSo far, the move looks like it has been a success. Today, Blevins streamed from the Red Bull tent at Lollapalooza, the Chicago music festival. While the number of viewers was lower today than the thousands of viewers he pulled in last year, it\u2019s almost double what he\u2019s been finding there for the last several weeks, as Polygon\u2019s Austen Goslin first noted. Even before Blevin\u2019s first stream on Mixer, his channel had found 370,000 paying subscribers, an impressive number for any streamer and one that was not lost on Blevins himself. That said, Mixer is offering two months of free subscriptions to Blevins\u2019 channel to everyone who signs up.\n\nDuring the stream, the crowd\u2019s energy was infectious; it seemed impossible for anyone watching in person to stop yelling. Blevins was his usual hyperactive self \u2014 slamming cans of Red Bull, one of the day\u2019s sponsors \u2014 and the crowd cheered for every elimination he earned. He was in high spirits, hunting down every player he could find and exploding them into showers of multicolored items. While he lost his first two games relatively early, Blevins managed to find back to back victories against the 99 other opponents on the map. (\u201cIt\u2019s easy. It\u2019s easy. GGs,\u201d he said, after his second win of the day.) At its best, Fortnite is a twitchy, fluid game of reflexes and resource management that rewards inventiveness just as much as it rewards good aim; at his best, Blevins has both, though he\u2019s not a professional.\n\nShortly into his matches, Blevins found a partner: the musician Mitchell Brown, who records under the name Kid Quill. \u201cI was literally more nervous to play this than to perform my set,\u201d Brown said, after he\u2019d been knocked out. Which seems true: Blevins, a former professional Halo player, is the most popular video game player on the planet.\n\nThe day at Lollapalooza was leading up to Fortnite Friday, a weekly Fortnite tournament for celebrity players, streamers, and professionals. In the games before the tournament \u2014 where he was to play with Kyle \u201cBugha\u201d Giersdorf, the 16-year-old who\u2019s the game\u2019s newest world champion \u2014 Blevins was performing: calling his shots, showing off for the crowd. \u201cI freakin\u2019 love you guys,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\n\nPlaying the game still seems fun for him. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you the last time I planned a session to game until Fortnite came out,\u201d Blevins told Brown. He was still excited to get up in the mornings and run squads with his boys, is what he meant.", "description": "Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins \u2014 the Fortnite livestreamer and all-around entertainer \u2014 had his first exclusive broadcast on Microsoft\u2019s Mixer platform; in the moments before his broadcast officially began, the number of people watching his stream crossed 50,000 and 60,000 people to land, in its first moments, somewhere around 76,000 sets of eyes.
