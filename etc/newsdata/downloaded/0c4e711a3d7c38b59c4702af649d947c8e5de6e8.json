And if you didn't hedge you will have done well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n(GRAPHIC: Sovereign bond yield heatmap - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/6984/6915/heatmap0710.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nHedges are usually implemented via currency forwards that specify the rate at which a currency may be exchanged over the contract period -- usually three or six months. That effectively shields the fund if the foreign currency depreciates against its base currency.\n\nFunds rarely disclose their hedging strategies but interviews with money managers and advisors, data on hedged and unhedged bond returns, and exchange rate moves imply the ratio of unhedged debt holdings in portfolios has been rising.\n\nA survey of corporate clients by U.S. bank Wells Fargo showed 35% of FX exposure was hedged in 2018, versus 47% in 2016, indicating a broader decline in hedging appetite.\n\nJapan's $1.5 trillion Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) recently decided to reclassify FX-hedged foreign debt as domestic, giving itself leeway to buy more foreign debt -- including \"scope to increase buying of FX-unhedged foreign bonds\", Barclays analysts wrote.\n\nA yen-based investor currently earns a 196 bp yield pickup on 10-year Treasuries -- but a 0.5% loss after hedging costs.\n\nFor an interactive version of the below graphic, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/31u7eRl.\n\n\n\n\n\n(GRAPHIC: Losing appeal - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/BOND-RETURNS-HEDGING/0H001QX7G8GF/eikon.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nJapanese funds bought 2.57 trillion yen ($23.76 billion) of U.S. bonds in July, official data shows, the most in a month since July 2016.\n\nWith little reliable data, investors often use exchange rate moves to draw conclusions on hedge ratios. Because hedging effectively offsets the purchase of an FX asset by selling the same currency in forward markets, a currency may strengthen more if it is not being sold for hedging purposes.\n\nDissaux said the U.S. dollar's resilience in the face of interest rate cuts and slowing growth is partly due to investors not hedging their dollar exposure.\n\nTohru Sasaki, head of Japan rates and FX research at JPMorgan, says the dollar-yen exchange rate has a fairly stable correlation to the yield gap between 10-year Treasuries and Japanese government bonds.\n\n\"But in September the dollar has shifted about one yen above the usual correlation and it rose further in the last couple of weeks, which suggests unusual factors are driving up dollar/yen,\" he added.\n\n\"Unhedged foreign bond buying by Japanese investors is the most likely culprit.\"\n\nFor an interactive version of the below graphic, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2ZZ4b6p.\n\n\n\n\n\n(GRAPHIC: Going West - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/JAPAN-BOND-PURCHASES/0H001QX7H8GJ/eikon.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nTRIMMING HEDGES?\n\nThe shift is important because bond investors are a risk-averse bunch.
