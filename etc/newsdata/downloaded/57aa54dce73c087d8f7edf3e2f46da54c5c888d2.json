Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has moved from the loony left to \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d with her latest nutty plan to achieve her impossible dream of turning America into a socialist utopia.\n\nIn reality, the congresswoman\u2019s plan would bring about a national nightmare \u2013 not just for all of us alive today, but for future generations \u2013 because it would destroy the U.S. economy. Building it back up would take a very long time.\n\nOcasio-Cortez labels her absurd plan A Just Society. If you regret not being born early enough to enjoy the fun times of the Great Depression, or want to live in a \u201cworkers\u2019 paradise\u201d like North Korea, Venezuela or Cuba, you\u2019ll love Comrade AOC\u2019s plan.\n\nAOC GETS CHOKED UP AT CLIMATE FORUM: 'MY DREAMS OF MOTHERHOOD ARE NOW BITTERSWEET'\n\nIncredibly, this cockeyed plan has been praised by one of the leading contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination \u2013 Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.\n\n\u201cIt's going to take big, structural change to tackle poverty and inequality in the U.S., and @AOC's \u2018A Just Society\u2019 is just the type of bold, comprehensive thinking we'll need to get it done,\u201d Warren recently tweeted.\n\nLike her Green New Deal and other wacko plans, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s latest attempt to fundamentally transform the United States into a bastion of Marxism would end up erasing the tremendous economic growth Americans have experienced not just under the Trump administration, but throughout American history.\n\nOcasio-Cortez says her legislation, which is composed of several different bills, would \u201ccombat one of the greatest threats to our country, our democracy, and our freedom: economic inequality.\u201d\n\nThere aren\u2019t enough rich people to pay for AOC\u2019s grandiose plans, even if government confiscated all their money and left them penniless and homeless.\n\nThat\u2019s right, folks, you can forget about terrorism, trade wars, America\u2019s $22 trillion debt, skyrocketing health insurance costs and every other significant problem facing the country. Apparently, the real threat to Americans\u2019 health and welfare is that Amazon head Jeff Bezos has too many billions of dollars in investments and Bill Gates \u2013 the world\u2019s most generous philanthropist \u2013 owns too many houses.\n\nThe Just Society plan would solve America\u2019s alleged wealth gap \u201cproblem\u201d by \u2013 surprise \u2013 dramatically expanding the power of the federal government and its welfare programs and running up tens of trillions of dollars in new debt in the process.\n\nThere aren\u2019t enough rich people to pay for AOC\u2019s grandiose plans, even if government confiscated all their money and left them penniless and homeless. Like a credit card bill that keeps growing, at some point Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s trillions of dollars in massive new spending would have to be paid for \u2013 meaning gigantic tax increases for all of us, our children, grandchildren and beyond.\n\nThe most important part of the Just Society proposal is that it would substantially expand the meaning of \u201cpoverty\u201d so that potentially tens of millions of additional Americans would be considered legally impoverished and made newly eligible for numerous welfare programs. These include the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly referred to as food stamps.\n\nYou know the old saying that there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch? Comrade AOC would hand out free breakfasts, lunches and dinners, among many other free benefits. Perhaps the Tooth Fairy, little elves living in trees, or space aliens landing in Area 51 would foot the bill.\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s Recognizing Poverty Act would direct \u201cthe Department of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with the Bureau of Census and Bureau of Labor Statistics, to adjust the federal poverty line to account for geographic cost variation, costs related to health insurance, work expenses for the family, child care needs, and new necessities, like internet access.\u201d\n\nAs Matt Weidinger of the American Enterprise Institute notes, a 2018 report found that if the standard used in Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s legislation were applied to the residents of New York City, roughly 40 percent of all households would be considered impoverished, compared to only 14 percent under the current standards.\n\nAltering the poverty line in accordance with Comrade AOC\u2019s legislation would also push tens of millions of people onto the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program and Medicaid, among other programs.\n\nIn some cases, people would effectively have no choice but to be forced onto the government dole. For example, many of the families now receiving health insurance subsidies to purchase insurance plans in ObamaCare exchanges would suddenly become eligible for Medicaid and would no longer be able to have access to those subsidies. This would require them to choose between enrolling in Medicaid or paying the much higher, non-subsidy ObamaCare price for private insurance.\n\nThere are already more than 72 million people enrolled in Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. The Just Society plan would increase those numbers dramatically.\n\nBut that\u2019s just the beginning. The Just Society proposal would also prevent government agents from denying convicted criminals access to federal welfare, health, disability, education, and other government social and welfare benefits on the basis of their conviction \u2013 regardless of how serious the offense was.\n\nThe same would be true for immigrants who are residing in the United States illegally. Under Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s plan, immigration status cannot prevent welfare eligibility, giving millions of people now here in violation of federal law access to taxpayer-funded public benefits.\n\nThis one provision alone could destroy the American economy, because it would likely encourage millions of people from around the world to come to the United States to receive free services we have no way of paying for.\n\nAnd, of course, Ocasio-Cortez doesn\u2019t believe in immigration restrictions. Imagine tripling, quadrupling or further increasing the U.S. population with people from around the world looking for \u201cfree stuff.\u201d How could the rest of us support them all?\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nDoes forcing Americans to pay for food stamps and health care for non-Americans and college education for violent offenders sound \u201cjust\u201d and \u201cfair\u201d to you?\n\nThe Just Society would also enact strict housing price controls on landlords, lowering the incentives for developers to construct new housing projects.\n\nThe U.S. economy is better now than at any time in recent memory. Unemployment is low for virtually every demographic, the stock market continues to remain at near-historic highs, and there are more than 7 million job openings.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI guess all that is considered \u201cunjust\u201d by Comrade AOC. Under her grand plan we\u2019d all be equally impoverished, equally overtaxed, equally dependent on government assistance, and equally suffering in a socialist hell.\n\nThe Just Society is anything but. It should be rejected by every American with even an elementary school-level knowledge of how our economy works.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JUSTIN HASKINS", "description": "Socialist Rep.
