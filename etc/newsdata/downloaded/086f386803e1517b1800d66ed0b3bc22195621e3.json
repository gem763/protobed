And one of them \u2014 Biden \u2014 would be far better positioned to amass delegates on a primary date that offers a windfall of roughly 1,300.\n\nBy contrast, in the four early-state contests only 155 delegates are up for grabs.\n\n\u201cIf history is any guide, this will likely be a two-person race coming out of South Carolina, and whomever emerges from Super Tuesday with a significant delegate lead will be extremely difficult to catch,\u201d a senior Biden official said.\n\nUnder Democratic delegate selection rules, some congressional districts are allocated more delegates than others. For months, the campaign has zeroed in on the most delegate-rich congressional districts in Super Tuesday states like Texas, North Carolina, California and Alabama and attempted to assemble slates of supporters specific to those districts.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": ""}
