Miami\u2019s next star could come from within \u2013 Bam Adebayo and/or Tyler Herro, who has generated buzz this preseason.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSean Deveney of Heavy:\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been firm on him and (Bam) Adebayo being untouchable,\u201d one GM told Heavy.com before Herro\u2019s explosive night. \u201cMaybe they would move off of that as the season goes on, but as it stands, they think they\u2019ve got the second coming of Klay Thompson offensively. They have not had a lot of useful guys on rookie contracts in past years and that\u2019s killed their cap. They\u2019ve got two now, they don\u2019t want to let them go.\u201d\n\nI doubt Herro and Adebayo are totally untouchable. If the right star became available, Miami could change its stance. But that wasn\u2019t Russell Westbrook. Bradley Beal? We\u2019ll see if the Wizards ever make him available.\n\nThe No. 13 pick in this year\u2019s draft, Herro is an excellent shooter with plenty of range. But Klay Thompson comparisons look off base. A large part of Thompson\u2019s value is his defense. Herro has a long way to go to prove he\u2019s not a defensive liability. (To be fair to the Heat, this is just some anonymous GM. He\u2019s not necessarily conveying an assessment from Miami.)\n\nAdebayo has looked good in his two NBA seasons. But the level of play for centers across the league is so high. It\u2019s a tough position for creating value.\n\nThe Heat should be pleased to have both players. But they also can\u2019t rest on their laurels and assume Herro and Adebayo will develop into prominent players on a contender.", "description": "The Heat want stars.", "authors": ["Dan Feldman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/CNS0OlYosnxyvFDPHrEV_w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0bZ9wzNxexiyBaZm6SIg3g--~B/aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/a57d97e7777f6f0e40fac08eea296ee8", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
