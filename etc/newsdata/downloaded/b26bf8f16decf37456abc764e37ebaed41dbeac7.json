USA TODAY\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 Chris Long was like many of you, NFL fans -- confused by what he was watching.\n\nLong, the former defensive end who retired in May, was watching Monday night\u2019s Green Bay Packers-Detroit Lions game when an illegal hands to the face penalty was mistakenly called on Lions defensive end Trey Flowers on third down late in the game. The penalty extended Green Bay\u2019s drive, and Detroit had used all its timeouts, so the Packers drained the clock and kicked the game-winning field goal for a 23-22 victory.\n\n\u201cYeah, I was sitting there just as dumbfounded as everybody else Monday night when those two penalties cost Detroit the game,\u201d Long told USA TODAY Sports on Wednesday.\n\nOn Tuesday, NFL executive vice president of football operations Troy Vincent said \u201cwhen you look at it and you review the play, it\u2019s not something that you want to see called in that particular pass rush\u201d and that \u201cthe foul wasn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nLong isn't alone in his criticism of the officiating. Several players and coaches have complained this season, citing inconsistency on enforcement. In the spring annual meetings, NFL ownership approved a measure to grant coaches the ability to challenge pass-interference calls, and non-calls to be reviewed and potentially overturned when there is \u201cclear and obvious\u201d evidence to support an overturn.\n\nOn Wednesday, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said the interference challenge rule is \u201cwhat we anticipated.\u201d In practice, however, only one challenge has been overturned so far this season.\n\n\u201cI don't think that officiating is going to ruin the game, but it's something that they need to rectify, because one thing the NFL doesn't like is all this noise that's un-ignorable from social media and the media and [the NFL] will be reactive,\u201d Long said. \u201cThey were reactive to the holding calls spiking way up the first month of the season. They need to be reactive to some of these issues, too.\n\nChris Long says the NFL needs to do something about officiating issues.

It's a mess right now, but it's not going to ruin the game because people aren't going to turn it off.\u201d\n\nBrowns quarterback Baker Mayfield called officiating \u201cpretty bad\u201d in Sunday\u2019s 32-28 Cleveland loss against the Seattle Seahawks. New Orleans Saints defensive end Cam Jordan, after officials blew dead a scoop-and-score fumble in Week 2 and negated the touchdown, blasted the \u201cFoot Locker\u201d crew of officials.\n\nLong understands it but believes even with the criticism, fans will tune in, calling football \u201caddictive.\u201d\n\nStill, after an infamous missed defensive pass interference in last year\u2019s NFC Championship game almost certainly cost the Saints a trip to the Super Bowl, and after the missed call Monday night cost the Lions a chance to win, there\u2019s a legitimate claim that the NFL product is suffering with officiating mistakes.\n\n\u201cThe Lions are a good football team,\u201d Long said. \u201cThat's the worst part about it. This could impact their playoff opportunities.\u201d\n\nOH MY GOD THE REFS LOST THE LIONS A GAME!!! \u2014 Chris Long (@JOEL9ONE) October 15, 2019\n\nLong spoke to USA TODAY Sports on behalf of Crown Royal, as part of its Water Break campaign that advocates for responsible alcohol consumption by taking a water break to stay hydrated.\n\nLong, playing devil\u2019s advocate, said adding another official in the booth to review all missed calls would lead to a cleaner game, but acknowledged that it would greatly slow the pace of play.\n\n\u201cI think that the NFL has got a moving target to hit and they got to hit it fast,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 They've got to get more consistent.\u201d", "description": "Ex-Eagles DE Chris Long is retired from the NFL but still consumes the game.
