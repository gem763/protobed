I\u2019ll let you guess what the \u201cF\u201d stands for.\n\nHis 2016 tour during the election was known as the \u201cFDT\u201d tour. He\u2019s been known to bring a pinata of Trump onstage and beat on it.\n\nI mean, hating on Trump is sort of his thing.\n\nSo grant him this much: It is a little strange to find a Trump supporter at one of his shows. It\u2019d be like finding YG himself in the crowd at a MAGA rally.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t come to a motherf***ing show with YG on the motherf***ing bill if you a Donald Trump supporter,\u201d YG reportedly said. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s racist. He don\u2019t f*** with Black people, so if you f*** with Donald Trump, you racist as f*** and I can\u2019t f*** with you. Period.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t let his ass back in the crowd,\u201d the rapper demanded. \u201cTell him YG said so.\u201d\n\nThe bad news: It seems the kid was booted from a show he presumably paid good money to see for the crime of not agreeing with the star\u2019s politics. After being publicly humiliated by him.\n\nThe good news: There\u2019s now an 85 percent chance he\u2019ll be a speaker at the next Republican convention.\n\nIn fact, I\u2019ll be shocked if he\u2019s not already booked for Fox News primetime tonight. Most of the reason partisan media exists anymore, after all, is to make folk heroes of people who defy the political opposition in some notable way.\n\nExit question: Will Kanye do a MAGA version of this at his next show? \u201cI want you to say \u2018f*** the people who say \u2018f*** Donald Trump.'\u201d Given the message of his new album, I\u2019m guessing no, he won\u2019t.", "description": "\"F*** off outta here.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
