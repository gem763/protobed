The new dishes represent a different category of Japanese cuisine, with last year's competition being based around curry dishes.\n\nThis year, the 10 possible additions are all donburi, a traditional Japanese rice bowl meal.\n\n\u201cWe are always looking for new ways to give our passengers a voice and inviting their input on the services that we offer in order to create a more responsive airline,\u201d said Hideki Kunugi, Executive Vice President of ANA. \u201cVoting via the internet and social media platforms is a fun way for the public to make their opinion heard and ensure that our offerings align with their interests. ANA will continue prioritizing consumer input as we align every aspect of the in-flight experience with passenger needs.\u201d\n\nThe donburi dishes are meant to capture the local flavor of 10 distinct Japanese regions. There will be two different voting periods, with participants choosing their favorite dishes from eastern Japan and western Japan.\n\nThe first voting period, which will determine the top two dishes from Japan's eastern regions, will run until Oct 17.\n\nThe next voting period, to determine the top two dishes inspired by western Japan, will start on Oct 18 and finish on Oct 27 at 113:59 p.m.\n\nVoting will be open to ANA customers from all over the world, and the top four vote getters will be served on Premium Economy and Economy Class international flights departing from Japan starting in March 2020. The specific routes for each dish will be announced in February 2020.\n\n\u00a9 Japan Today", "description": "All Nippon Airways (ANA) is once again inviting the public to vote on which dishes will be added to its Premium Economy and Economy Class in-flight menus.
