REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader/File Photo\n\nChinese-owned FACC makes components for wings, tail assemblies and fuselages as well as engines and cabin interiors for all major planemakers.\n\nSo far 2019 has been a slow year for the commercial aerospace industry, beset by negative headlines on safety following two deadly plane crashes and the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nFACC said in its half annual report on Tuesday that while production rates of all major aircraft types had stabilized at a high level, no significant increases were expected for 2020.\n\n\u201cWe expect sustained growth in the aviation industry in the long run, but are currently observing a slight flattening of the growth curve,\u201d Chief Executive Robert Machtlinger said. \u201cThis trend is reflected in our sales development, which shows a smaller increase than planned.\u201d\n\nHowever, operational measures to reduce costs were progressing and would lead to stable profitability from the second half of 2020, he said.\n\nIts shares fell 2.6% in early trading.\n\nOwned by China\u2019s Aviation Industry Corporation (AVIC) (000768.SZ), the group reported earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 8.6 million euros ($9.5 million) on largely flat revenue of 179.7 million in the three months through end-August. New orders surpassed $800 million.\n\nAround half of FACC\u2019s revenue comes from Airbus (AIR.PA), which reported a 13.5% rise in nine-month deliveries, well ahead of U.S. rival Boeing, whose deliveries nearly halved due to the grounding of the B737 MAX. FACC does not supply the new aircraft, which has been grounded following two deadly crashes.\n\nA decision by the World Trade Organization, which formally authorized the United States on Monday to impose tariffs on Airbus aircraft, does not cover aircraft components \u201cand thus products of the FACC Group are not affected,\u201d the company said.\n\nFACC also produces components for Chinese planemaker COMAC, which Machtlinger expects to become a fierce rival to Airbus and Boeing within 10 years. Revenues for COMAC\u2019s ARJ 21 regional jet and the narrow-body C919 increased in the first half and have become a major revenue driver at the cabin interior unit, FACC said.\n\nFACC expects sales of around 600 million euros and an EBIT margin of close to 6% for its shortened March-December 2019 financial year. From 2020, the group will report per calendar year.", "description": "Plane parts maker FACC's operating profit fell 6% in the second quarter as it produced fewer components for the Airbus A380 and Boeing 737NG jets being phased out and start-up costs for new cabin interiors bit.", "authors": ["Kirsti Knolle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441023801&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0FD-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
