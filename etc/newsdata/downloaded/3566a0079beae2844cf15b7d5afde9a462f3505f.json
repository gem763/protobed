Elizabeth Warren was a strong candidate who has learned on the campaign trail, and whose wealth-tax proposal is popular among both Democrats and Republicans. \u201cI don\u2019t like what she says, but she says it really well,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s smart.\u201d\n\nHe was less enthused about former Vice President Joe Biden, whom he called \u201cJurassic Joe,\u201d and Sen. Kamala Harris, whom he said wasn\u2019t quick on her feet. Gundlach said he thinks former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton could still enter the field, judging by a recent speech she delivered, particularly if Biden were to bow out.\n\nHe said Trump wouldn\u2019t run for re-election if there\u2019s a recession as efforts to blame the Fed wouldn\u2019t work because most Americans don\u2019t know what the central bank is.", "description": "Jeffrey Gundlach on Thursday struck a pessimistic tone, saying there was a 75% chance of a recession before the next election as he warned the corporate bond...", "authors": ["Steve Goldstein", "European Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR161_gundla_ZG_20190912081034.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
