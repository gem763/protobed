But he bided his time before committing to an album - releasing 11 singles and two EPs over the next four years.\n\nAlong the way he caught the attention of rap superstar Drake, who jumped on the remix for Wanna Know. Dave later featured on Drake's More Life mixtape, and the two collaborated on the Netflix drama Top Boy, in which Dave plays drug dealer Modie.\n\nDrake later revealed he'd discovered the South London MC by absentmindedly browsing YouTube and stumbling across a playlist called \"best new songs from London\".\n\n2) He listens to a lot of film soundtracks\n\nImage copyright Santan Dave / YouTube\n\nBritish rap can be myopic - focusing on the same minor-key aesthetics, clipped beats and self-aggrandising lyrics. Dave, a classically-trained pianist (he passed his grade seven exam years ago), looks further afield.\n\n\"I've always had a different ear for music. I really enjoy Lana Del Rey and Pink Floyd are amazing,\" he told Vice in 2016.\n\n\"I like soundtracks. I love Hans Zimmer, the score for The Dark Knight Rises is one of my favourites. I also like Man of Steel, Inception, Interstellar, Braveheart, Transformers - Steve Jablonsky with Arrival to Earth. Schindler's List too, that's beautiful.\n\n\"I've always listened to different styles of music to make sure I'm balanced. I feel like if you only listen to your type of music you can never go outside of it.\"\n\n3) His Glastonbury set went viral\n\nImage copyright BBC Music\n\nIn the middle of an already legendary Glastonbury set, Dave asked for some help from the audience.\n\n\"I got this track Thiago Silva,\" he declared. \"Who is sober enough to sing these lyrics along with me?\"\n\nWhen Dave singled out a reveller who was wearing a Paris Saint-Germain football strip with Silva on the back to perform with him on the stage, he had no idea what was coming.\n\nIt turned out 15-year-old Alex Mann did know all the lyrics to Thiago Silva. He knew them like Elton John knows the number of his florist. And instead of freezing like a rabbit in the headlights, he breezed through the song like he'd written it himself.\n\nIt was a wonderful moment - a rare occasion where a bit of throwaway crowd interaction becomes a you-won't-believe-what-happened highlight - and it duly went viral.\n\nMann later scored a record deal and released a debut single, What Ya Kno Bout That Bro?\n\n4) He dedicated the Mercury Prize to his incarcerated brother\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nDave's older brother, Christopher, is currently serving a life sentence for his part in a fatal stabbing in London's Victoria Station in 2010.\n\nOn his album, Dave describes Christopher as \"the only person I ever idolised\" and reveals how appalled and let down he felt, rapping: \"Never had a father and I needed you to be a figure.\"\n\nDave told the BBC the record had been inspired by the therapy his brother is receiving in prison - also known as Psychodrama - in which offenders role-play events from their past to help with rehabilitation.\n\n\"This is all his story. His Psychodrama inspired this,\" he explained. \"This album's always been dedicated to him, so to see it translate is something I can't put into words.\"\n\nAt the time of writing, he hadn't been able to inform his brother about the Mercury Prize but said it was only a matter of time.\n\n\"One visit, one phone call. That's all it takes to share the emotions.\"\n\n5) His mum didn't approve of his career choices... until now\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The star brought his mum on stage as he won the prize\n\nDave was still a student when his first tracks exploded on YouTube - so his mum didn't appreciate him cancelling a degree in law to pursue music.\n\n\"I was due to start last September - my mum really wanted me to do it,\" he told The Fader in 2017.\n\n\"When it gets to that time to tell your mum that you're not going to university, which has been her grand plan for you for the last 18 years, all of a sudden 700,000 YouTube views mean absolutely nothing.\n\n\"That's not a currency she recognises.\"\n\nBut she was won around eventually, joining her youngest son on stage at the Hammersmith Apollo on Thursday as he picked up his Mercury Prize.\n\n\"She's given me my life. I literally owe everything to her and God,\" he told the BBC backstage. \"So to have her here, and to have her experience this, is surreal.\"\n\nMind you, they hadn't spoken about the prize at all...\n\n\"She's just been screaming. She's gone crazy,\" he said, beaming with pride.\n\n\"It's not easy to make your mum feel like she's got something to scream and shout about.\"\n\n6) His track, Black, caused real controversy\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac (second left) presented Dave with the award, as host Lauren Laverne looked on admiringly\n\nThe lead single off the album, which Dave performed on Thursday night, focuses on the perception of black people in Britain.\n\n\"Black is pain, black is joy, black is evident,\" he raps. \"It's working twice as hard as the people you know you're better than.\"\n\nWhen it was played on BBC Radio 1, the song provoked complaints from a small minority of listeners who said it was \"racist against white people\".\n\nAnnie Mac spoke in defence of the song, saying: \"If you are genuinely offended by the idea of a man talking about the colour of his skin and how it has shaped his identity, then that is a problem for you.\"\n\n\"I'm just happy to be able to put out a message and affect people,\" Dave responded.\n\n7) The Mercury is not his first big music award, oh no...\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption Dave (left) and co-writer Fraser T Smith won best contemporary song at the 2018 Ivor Novello Awards\n\nBefore recording and releasing his number one debut, Dave's earlier political anthem, Question Time, won a top prize at the highly-respected Ivor Novello songwriting awards last year.\n\nThe seven-minute track, which raged about everything from Grenfell Tower to Syria and the NHS, was named best contemporary song at the ceremony.\n\nIn it he vented his anger and frustration at why the government spends so much on defence instead of wages for nurses like his mum, and about how \"terrified\" former prime minister Theresa May dealt with Grenfell.\n\nBilly Bragg, picking up the outstanding contribution award, said: \"It's a great privilege to win in the same year as Dave for something so political and powerful. It really fired up my spirit somewhat.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
