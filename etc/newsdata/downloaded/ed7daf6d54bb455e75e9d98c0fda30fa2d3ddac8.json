David Cicilline suggested that the Republican theatrics were a way pacifying President Trump, though Republicans have strongly rejected those assertions.\n\n\u201cThis is a stunt that responded very specifically to the president\u2019s complaint that they weren\u2019t fighting hard enough for him and in in direct response from Ambassador Taylor,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are playing to an audience of one. I\u2019m sure the president is very proud of them,\u201d he added.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
