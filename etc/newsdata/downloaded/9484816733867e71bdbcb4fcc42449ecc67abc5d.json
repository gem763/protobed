Some were unemployed.\n\nBut, Dr Barber adds, \"there is - at the moment - no legal route in for low-skilled Vietnamese migrants working in the UK, so this is obviously having to be done through very circuitous and precarious journeys\".\n\nHow much does the trip cost?\n\nMs Vu says prospective migrants can pay a range of prices. For those with less money - $10,000 to $15,000 (\u00a37,800 to \u00a311,600) - the journey is \"more arduous\" and could, for example, include stints of walking across forests at night.\n\nBut those who can afford to pay more - $40,000 to $50,000 (\u00a331,000 to \u00a339,000) - would travel mostly by plane.\n\nA sum of \u00a330,000 is the equivalent of 30 years' salary for someone living in a rural area in Vietnam, Ms Vu says.\n\nIt's \"an astronomical sum\", she adds, but some families believe it is worth it \"because they believe this is the best way for them or their child to have a better future\".\n\n\"Vietnam is a very family-centric culture and everything is done for the family.\"\n\nAccording to the UN, Vietnamese migrants may have generated $300m (\u00a3234m) a year for smugglers to take them to Europe.\n\nTo finance the trip, many borrow from family and acquaintances.\n\nSome are forced to use the informal credit market, with interest on the loan fluctuating at the whim of the lender.\n\nUnsurprisingly, if the journey fails, they would have attempted it again as it's the only way for them to recoup the money.\n\nDr Barber says others may raise the money through selling land or property.\n\nVietnamese families are taking these \"huge risks\" because they \"really view this as their one opportunity to send a family member abroad to earn money,\" she says.\n\nHow do they get to the UK?\n\nSmuggling agents market two type of services to transport migrants to the UK - \"premium\" or \"economy\" - according to research by the Independent Anti-slavery Commissioner.\n\nA premium service is advertised as taking as direct a route as possible with minimal risk. In one case, would-be migrants were given Schengen business visa application papers and a direct flight to Paris, where they were kept in safe houses before travelling to the UK.\n\nThe cheaper economy option would have taken them several months.\n\n\"But no matter what kind of 'class' of travel you choose, you are still going to end up at a border and still going to be snuck in in the back of a lorry or on a ferry,\" Ms Vu says.\n\nMost Vietnamese nationals arriving in Europe travel to Russia first before going overland through Eastern Europe.\n\nIn the past, many victims told the police that they had passed through China en route to the UK.\n\nIn fact, China, together with France, Russia, Germany and Poland, are among the common transit countries for Vietnamese migrants who attempt to travel to the UK.\n\nMany may stop in these transit countries, such as Ukraine or Poland, where they are asked to work in exploitative conditions to either finance the next leg of their journey or make money for their traffickers.\n\nThe last leg of the journey is likely from France. Here, people could pay a smuggler to be hidden in a secret compartment of a truck, or hide themselves in a truck close to the harbour without the driver noticing.\n\nA recent report funded by the Home Office noted Vietnamese who are trafficked for forced labour or sexual exploitation, or willingly smuggled to Europe, are vulnerable to exploitation during their journeys.\n\nGirls are particularly susceptible to sexual exploitation at the hands of traffickers, it said.", "description": "People from remote Vietnamese communities are paying as much as \u00a330,000 to be smuggled into the UK.", "authors": ["Quynh", "Bbc Vietnamese"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/483A/production/_109409481_essex-lorry-comp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
