Everyone knows this is a corrupt place. ... Plus, I'm not sure that the other European countries are helping them out either.\u201d\n\nMulvaney added: \u201cDid [Trump] also mention to me, in the past, the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that\u2019s it. And that\u2019s why we held up the money. ... They look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. And that is absolutely appropriate.\u201d\n\nBoth Conway and Mnuchin have been staunch defenders of the president.\n\nLast month Conway appeared on Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Story\u201d and took aim at the still-unidentified \u201cwhistleblower\u201d who raised concerns about trump\u2019s July phone call with the Ukrainian president.\n\n\"The whistleblower is someone who does not have firsthand knowledge of what happened,\" Conway said at the time, calling the individual \"more blowhard than whistleblower.\"\n\nDuring an August appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Mnuchin described the president as \u201cdetermined as ever\u201d in working out a trade agreement with China.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cFree, fair and reciprocal trade with China is a major goal of the president,\u201d Mnuchin said, \u201cand \u2026 he will do whatever he needs to in order to achieve this. That includes planned sanctions, and a willingness to deal with any Chinese retaliation accordingly.\u201d\n\nMulvaney, 52, became acting White House chief of staff in January, replacing retired Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly. The former congressman from South Carolina also remains director of the Office of Management and Budget, the office he assumed in February 2017.\n\nFox News\u2019 Joshua Nelson, Charles Creitz and Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump fired off a late-night Twitter message Tuesday, slamming as \u201cFake News!\u201d a story that said top aides Kellyanne Conway and Steve Mnuchin were under consideration to replace acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.", "authors": ["Dom Calicchio"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/22/694940094001_6096634475001_6096639876001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
