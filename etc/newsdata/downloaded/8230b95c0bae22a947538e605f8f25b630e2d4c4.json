Referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, he added, \u201cAnd then to see the official policy undermined by this clownishly corrupt effort led by Rudy Giuliani on behalf of the president was just more than many people apparently could bear.\u201d\n\nRepublicans who control the Senate view the fast-building case as serious enough to begin preparing for the trial in their chamber that would follow impeachment by the House. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, briefed fellow lawmakers over lunch on Wednesday about how a trial would work, expressing his hope of conducting it speedily and completing it by the end of the year, people familiar with his remarks said.\n\nFacing accusations of secrecy from Republicans, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, informed colleagues on Wednesday that he planned to open the inquiry to the public soon. He wrote that he planned to release transcripts of all the interviews as the investigation proceeded and pledged to soon hold public hearings \u201cso that the full Congress and the American people can hear their testimony firsthand.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Trump, who is famous for demanding fierce loyalty from those around him, the daily \u2014 or even hourly \u2014 crush of damaging headlines is an infuriating departure from previous successes in controlling disclosures to Congress from people in his orbit.\n\nDuring the congressional investigation into Russia\u2019s election meddling, Mr. Trump blocked a deposition of Donald F. McGahn II, his former White House counsel, and dramatically limited testimony from some of his closest aides, including Hope Hicks, the former White House communications director, and Corey Lewandowski, his former campaign manager.\n\nBut this is different. Many administration officials targeted for depositions by Democrats are diplomatic veterans who have expressed anger and frustration about what they described as the hijacking of American foreign policy. They have no particular loyalty to Mr. Trump, nor are they subject to the same presidential powers to block them from testifying.", "description": "After vowing not to cooperate with a \u201ckangaroo court,\u201d the president has largely failed to prevent current and former administration members from spending hours with Democrats seeking to impeach him.", "authors": ["Michael D.
