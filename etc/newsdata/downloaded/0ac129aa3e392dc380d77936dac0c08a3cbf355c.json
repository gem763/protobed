Sign up here.\n\nHundreds of pages of emails and other documents show how the Boston Police Department helps ICE find and arrest undocumented immigrants. The department even has a liaison responsible for fielding requests from the federal agency, though he was removed from the position Friday.\n\nThe documents, obtained by the ACLU of Massachusetts, show close collaboration between ICE agents and some of the police department\u2019s officers, including \u201ctask force officer\u201d Gregory Gallagher. He even offered to cover shifts for special agents within the Department of Homeland Security, which his federal training allowed him to do, according to WBUR, which reviewed the emails.\n\nICE also regularly sent Gallagher requests for police reports and other information on immigrants it was looking to arrest and, in some cases, asked him to detain people until ICE could pick them up \u2014 a practice the city outlawed five years ago, with a few exceptions.\n\nIn one email sent in March, an ICE agent sent Gallagher an email that read \u201chappy hunting,\u201d with a request to detain an immigrant attached.\n\nGallagher was removed from the position and reassigned to another role Friday. A Boston Police Department spokesperson told VICE News that he\u2019d worked for the department for 32 years but could not immediately confirm how long he had held the task force officer position.\n\n\u201cBasically, [Gallagher] is a liaison to this unit, which is not uncommon,\u201d said Boston police Sergeant Detective John Boyle. \u201c[W]henever [DHS/ICE] have involvement in the city of Boston with certain incidents, [Gallagher] gets involved and assists,\" a spokesperson told WBUR.\n\nThe Trust Act, passed by the Boston City Council in 2014, bars the city\u2019s police officers from honoring ICE requests to detain undocumented immigrants for additional periods of time unless a judge tells them to. The law doesn\u2019t forbid officers from working with ICE in other ways, but Boston mayor Marty Walsh has suggested that Boston is a sanctuary city \u2014 a jurisdiction that limits its cooperation with federal immigration agencies \u2014 in the past.\n\nGallagher could take on the liaison role because the city has an agreement with ICE and one of its divisions, Homeland Security Investigations, that lets certain department employees work \u201cas customs officers,\u201d according to documents reviewed by WBUR. And Walsh said on Saturday he doesn\u2019t expect the agreement with the immigration agency, known as a \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d to end, though he added that the emails raised \u201ca lot of questions\u201d over the department\u2019s cooperation with ICE.\n\n\u201cMy responsibility as mayor and the police department's responsibility is to make sure people are safe, and there's a role there to play in making sure that we share and get information, really, from federal immigration officials,\u201d Walsh told reporters on Saturday. He added that he\u2019s a \u201cpro-immigrant mayor\u201d and called Boston a \u201cpro-immigrant city,\u201d and said the city\u2019s immigrant community shouldn\u2019t worry about the relationship between the police department and ICE.\n\nWalsh\u2019s office had already began looking into the police department\u2019s cooperation with ICE after an undocumented construction worker sued the company he worked for, saying his boss retaliated against him for filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim by reporting him to ICE. The man\u2019s lawsuit said two detectives from the Boston police department helped ICE carry out the arrest.\n\nTogether, the lawsuit and the emails suggest that Gallagher wasn\u2019t the only Boston police officer working with ICE. Another officer, detective Juan Seoane, wrote to Gallagher in February asking him to help verify a person\u2019s immigration status and place of residence. \u201cHe wants to join team America, but think he was part of a scam with his documents,\u201d Seoane wrote. \u201cLet me know, nothing urgent, thanks.\u201d\n\nCover image: An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer prepares handcuffs and leg irons before a prisoner transfer at ICE's in Broadview, Ill. facility on March 14, 2008.
