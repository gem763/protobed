That five-hour window could hold key details about President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Gordon Sondland, the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union who spent hours testifying before Congress in a secure room in the Capitol Basement Thursday, is one of the few people who knows what transpired during those early morning hours.\n\nAfter Bill Taylor, the acting Ambassador to Ukraine, texted Sondland around midnight on Sept. 9 that it was \u201ccrazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Sondland went silent. At 5:19 a.m., Sondland came back with an unequivocal answer: there was no quid pro quo with Ukraine when it came to withholding foreign aid in exchange for a promise to investigate Trump\u2019s political rival. \u201cI believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions,\u201d Sondland texted Taylor. \u201cThe President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d He then suggested that they should stop texting about the matter, and told him to take further concerns directly to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nSondland says he spoke with Trump sometime in the five hours between those texts, which were released by House investigators earlier this month. According to a copy of his opening statement reviewed by TIME, Sondland confirmed that he spoke with the President that night because of Taylor\u2019s concerns. \u201cI asked the President: \u201cWhat do you want from Ukraine?\u201d The President responded, \u201cNothing. There is no quid pro quo.\u201d The President repeated: \u201cNo quid pro quo\u201d multiple times. This was a very short call,\u201d Sondland was expected to tell lawmakers. He also noted the President was in a \u201cbad mood\u201d that night. This acknowledgement, Democrats say, could directly implicate the President in a scheme to abuse the power of his office to help assure his reelection.\n\nRep. Gerry Connolly, who has called for Sondland to resign, told TIME he expected the 5-hour window to be a focus of Thursday\u2019s deposition of the envoy on Capitol Hill. \u201cI have every reason to believe our counsel will pursue that line,\u201d the Virginia Democrat tells TIME.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

During the phone call, a rough summary of which the White House released in late September, Trump spoke of U.S. assistance to Ukraine and the need to investigate Biden. They suspect Trump may have said further incriminating things linking the aid and the desired Biden probe on the call with Sondland, even though Sondland has said Trump told him there was no quid pro quo involved.\n\nThese suspicions were further confirmed on Thursday when Mick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s acting Chief of Staff, took to the microphones to say that there was in fact a quid pro quo with Ukraine. \u201cThe look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the things he was worried about in corruption with that nation. And that is absolutely appropriate,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nMulvaney ultimately walked back his statement. He was also specifically talking about Ukraine investigating conspiracy theories about the 2016 election rather than the Bidens, which is what Taylor seemed to be referencing. But the initial concession in itself seemed to raise more questions for Sondland about the President\u2019s role in the arrangement.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he acknowledged it, I think there\u2019s complete overwhelming evidence that in fact the, the Administration and the President was making it clear that the military aid that was being that was authorized by Congress was being held up and would not be released until he was satisfied,\u201d said Rep. David Cicilline, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and attended Sondland\u2019s deposition. \u201cThey were committed to helping him in his reelection by ginning up this fake investigation against one of our partners.\u201d\n\nSondland\u2019s testimony follows several current and former senior State Department officials\u2019 depositions detailing the envoy\u2019s role. On Tuesday, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent told Congress that in a May 23 meeting, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney charged Sondland and U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry to be in charge of Ukraine policy in addition to the U.S. special envoy to the country, Kurt Volker. \u201cThey called themselves the \u2018three amigos,\u2019\u201d Connolly told reporters after Kent\u2019s testimony.\n\nThe three, along with Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani led the efforts to get Ukrainian leaders to publicly announce that they were investigating the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, the company with ties to Biden\u2019s son, as well as Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election, in exchange for a White House visit the Ukrainians desperately wanted. The three men\u2019s actions alarmed officials inside the White House and the State Department, many of whom are testifying in the impeachment probe.\n\nSondland told lawmakers and investigators in his opening remarks that Trump was reluctant to set up a phone call with Ukraine after Zelensky won the election because he was concerned that Ukraine was not serious about curbing corruption, and urged the threesome to talk to Giuliani. Sondland was uncomfortable with the request but did it anyway because it was coming from the President. When he spoke with Giuliani, he said in his opening remarks, Giuliani mentioned investigations into the 2016 election and Burisma, but Sondland said he did not piece together that Hunter Biden was on the board of Burisma and that the request could be construed as intervening in the 2020 election.\n\nHis remarks solidify the picture other officials questioned by Congress have already painted: a highly irregular process that effectively took control of U.S. policy towards Ukraine away from official diplomatic channels, and dispensed with State Department rules for such missions. Sondland routinely used personal, unencrypted mobile phones while conducting business on behalf of the U.S. government, asked foreign officials if they would like to come to Washington, and gave them his own and other officials\u2019 personal telephone numbers and email addresses, two U.S. officials who have worked with Sondland told TIME.\n\nDemocrats leaving Sondland\u2019s testimony acknowledged that some parts \u2013 for example, his assertion that he had not pieced together that mentions of Burisma were related to Hunter Biden\u2019s role on its board \u2013 didn\u2019t necessarily add up. \u201cWhat is implausible is to say, \u2018I didn\u2019t know what Giuliani was up to,\u2019 said Connolly. \u201cGiuliani was ubiquitous all over the press and all over Ukraine, and if you\u2019re the Ambassador to the EU who chose to highlight the Ukraine as your portfolio\u2026it stretches credulity for you to assert \u2018I had no idea that those were the earthly concerns of Mr. Giuiliani.'\u201d\n\nBut the fact that Sondland is testifying at all is a victory for the Democrats. He was originally slated to appear voluntarily before the three committees conducting the inquiry on October 8th, only to find out once he arrived in the U.S. from Brussels that the State Department had blocked his testimony. He will now appear under a subpoena, which the committees issued on October 9th. However, he won\u2019t be providing the documents the committees requested because they are being withheld by the State Department, according to his attorneys. (Sondland has hired Robert Luskin, a longtime Washington lawyer who represented GOP strategist Karl Rove in the Valerie Plame affair, to be his attorney.)\n\nIn a letter to the committees on Thursday, Sondland\u2019s attorneys confirmed the State Department was still withholding the documents.\n\n\u2014With reporting by Brian Bennett/Washington\n\nWrite to Alana Abramson at Alana.Abramson@time.com.", "description": "Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union who is set to testify before Congress, is one of the few people who knows what happened during a key five-hour window", "authors": ["Alana Abramson", "Vera Bergengruen", "John Walcott"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ap19281065760211.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C71px%2C2355px%2C1233px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
