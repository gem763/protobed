It will be tasked to advise the council on policing matters, make policy recommendations, produce an annual report and host at least one annual public forum to receive community input.\n\nDuring Monday\u2019s meeting, Mr. Reimer and fellow Democratic council members Will Jawando (at-large), Tom Hucker (District 5), Sidney Katz (District 3) and Gabe Albornoz (at-large) reviewed concerns raised at the public hearing last month and asked questions about the details of the legislation.\n\nAdvocacy groups at a public hearing last month requested that commission members be representative of the community in race, ethnicity and age. Mr. Riemer introduced an amendment to address the issues.\n\nUnder Bill 14-19, a representative of Montgomery County Police Department and the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) would serve as nonvoting members of the commission.\n\nSome members of the community have voiced opposition to including police representatives, while others have said police members should be allowed to vote on matters concerning their work.\n\nIn a letter to the council, the county executive\u2019s office expressed general support for the legislation and suggested that the commission also advise the executive and that the FOP representative be the union\u2019s president or the president\u2019s designee.\n\nMeanwhile, county Executive Marc Elrich is continuing his search for a new police chief after his nominee \u2014 Tonya Chapman, the former police chief of Portsmouth, Virginia \u2014 withdrew her name from consideration.\n\nSeveral council members had questioned her nomination. She was asked to resign in Portsmouth from a department that had its own issues over racism, police brutality and challenges with morale and leadership.\n\nThe Montgomery County Police Department has weathered a few issues of its own recently.\n\nIn July, Officer Kevin Moris was charged with assault after a video went viral of him using his shin to force the head of Arnoldo Pesoa into the ground during an arrest at a McDonald\u2019s in the Aspen Hill Shopping Center.\n\nThe department opened an investigation in May over another video of a white police officer using the \u201cN-word\u201d in an encounter with a group of young black men in the McDonald\u2019s parking lot in the White Oak section of Silver Spring.\n\nIn April, a department investigation found that Officer Anand Badgujar was justified in fatally shooting Robert White, a 41-year-old unarmed, black man walking near Sligo Creek Parkway in August 2018.\n\nThat shooting, which drew plenty of community outrage, prompted Mr. Riemer to begin crafting the legislation to create the commission with the assistance of the local chapter of the NAACP.\n\nThe next work session for the legislation has not yet been scheduled.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
