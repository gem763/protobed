Pei Dreamed Up His Designs", "language": "en", "text": "For more than 45 years, the architect I.M. Pei and his wife, Eileen Pei, lived in a modest house on New York\u2019s Sutton Place, a historic enclave on Manhattan\u2019s east side known for its prewar townhomes, tree-lined streets and expansive East River views. While the neighborhood attracted many famous faces over the years\u2014Marilyn Monroe, Arthur Miller and Freddie Mercury all called it home\u2014the Peis lived there discreetly, surrounded by their extensive art collection.\n\nMr. Pei, whose well-known works include the iconic glass pyramid at the Louvre museum in Paris, often worked at home, sometimes waking in the night with an idea for the design of a new building. He kept a marker and notepad by the bed so he could quickly sketch what he had dreamed up before it slipped away, according to his son, the architect Li Chung Pei, who goes by Sandi.\n\nThe younger Mr. Pei said his father would sit in his study working to a soundtrack of classical music, sometimes Bach or Beethoven, or recline in his bentwood rocking chair, designed by the German-Austrian cabinet maker Michael Thonet, and look out at the large magnolia and plane trees in the back garden.\n\nThe Home Designed by the Master I.M. Pei and his wife Eileen Pei bought their four-story Sutton Place townhouse when it was ramshackle and rundown. Then he worked his magic on it The longtime home of I.M. Pei and his wife Eileen Pei is coming on the market for $8 million.

Pei and his wife Eileen Pei is coming on the market for $8 million. Kelly Marshall for The Wall Street Journal\n\nNow, after his death earlier this year at age 102, the home where he churned out ideas is coming on the market for $8 million.\n\nThe Peis purchased the four-story, 4-bedroom, 3,848 square-foot townhouse in 1973 from Laura \u201cPolly\u201d Delano, a cousin of President Theodore Roosevelt, for just $215,000, records show. The Peis had been living in a nearby 1930s-era co-op building on Beekman Place, where they had raised their children. Sandi Pei is one of three surviving Pei children; a brother named T\u2019ing Chung died in 2003. Amid a downturn in the New York City economy in the early 1970s, Ms. Pei spotted a bargain for the house. \u201cIt was in a dilapidated condition,\u201d his son recalled. \u201cDark and dirty and sort of crumbling.\u201d\n\nHis parents embarked on a significant renovation. His father\u2019s design called for an extension at the rear of the property and the installation of floor-to-ceiling glass windows, which flooded the home with light and gave way to views of the expansive rear garden, which is shared by about 14 neighboring houses. Mr. Pei also designed a dramatic serpentine staircase in the center of the home, leading up to a geometric oblong skylight, and custom-designed soapstone mantels for three of the home\u2019s four fireplaces, his son said.\n\nThe study where I.M. Pei came up with some of his most groundbreaking design ideas. Photo: Kelly Marshall for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe Peis lived surrounded by art. Grand sculptures by Jean Dubuffet, an artist known for his cellular forms, were displayed around the space, as were works by Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline. Next to his rocking chair, Mr. Pei displayed a piece by his friend, cubist sculptor Jacques Lipchitz, called \u201cHomme \u00e0 la guitare.\u201d Sandi recalled the day Mr. Pei purchased the sculpture, when Sandi was only about 10 or 12 years old. They\u2019d made a trip to Mr. Lipchitz\u2019s studio in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., where Mr. Pei selected the piece. \u201cMr. Lipchitz said, \u2018Just pay me a little and I\u2019ll tell you if you\u2019ve paid me enough,\u2019\u201d Sandi laughed.\n\nMany of the Peis artworks will be sold by Christie\u2019s, the auction house, later this year. Sandi said it is hard to see the home, which is now staged for sale, without the art on the walls. \u201cIt\u2019s sad because the two things\u2014the home and the art\u2014seemed inseparable,\u201d he said.\n\nThe home\u2019s main living spaces, which include a large library with built-in bookshelves and an airy living room used to host parties, are located on the second floor. The space was kept \u201cimmaculately clean,\u201d according to \u201cI.M. Pei: A Profile in American Architecture,\u201d by Carter Wiseman.\n\nThe view from the garden behind the Peis\u2019 four-story, Sutton Place townhouse.

If a picture frame should be left askew by the cleaning woman, Eileen is likely to excuse herself from a conversation to straighten it,\u201d Mr. Wiseman wrote.\n\nOn the first floor, a formal dining room opens onto a private garden, said the listing agent, Edward F. Joseph of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate.\n\nThe couple entertained often. Guests at their dinner parties included artistic luminaries of the day, such as the French-born art dealer Pierre Matisse, son of artist Henri Matisse, and his wife Tana Matisse; the musician Itzhak Perlman; the cellist Yo-Yo Ma; and the Chinese-French painter Zao Wou-Ki. They also hosted diplomats like Henry Kissinger and Richard Holbrooke, their son said. Their neighbors included Annalee Newman, the widow of abstract expressionist painter Barnett Newman; Ms. Newman, who lived at the iconic River House co-op nearby, became a close friend and was a fixture at family dinners.\n\nThe home\u2019s master bedroom.

Morgan, is located a few homes away; Kofi Annan and Boutros Boutros-Ghali both lived there during the Peis\u2019 residence.\n\nMs. Pei was a prolific cook with a penchant for French cuisine, her son said. After traveling abroad, she would return and re-create the dishes they had eaten from memory. A landscape architect and botanist by training, she filled the house with flowers. Mr. Pei was a wine aficionado, enjoying a glass of French Bordeaux\u2014or, more infrequently, a martini. The Peis built a basement wine cellar that holds more than 1000 bottles.\n\nThe Peis were neighborhood fixtures on Sutton Place and regulars at Gino of Capri, a nearby Italian eatery known for its distinctive red zebra-motif wallpaper. They would take the family and, on weekends, Mr. Pei would sometimes take his team of architects to the now-defunct restaurant to go over plans. \u201cIt had totally unremarkable food but a wonderful ambience,\u201d Sandi said. \u201cYou knew the menu by heart even though it was two pages long.\u201d\n\nI.M.

He was studying architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and she was studying art at Wellesley College. They married in 1942. Ms. Pei died in 2014.\n\nAfter studying at M.I.T. and Harvard University, Mr. Pei was recruited as an in-house architect for William Zeckendorf, a major developer of the time. He designed multiple projects for Mr. Zeckendorf\u2019s firm, including Kips Bay Towers, a massive apartment complex on East 33rd Street. Mr. Pei went on to start his own practice. His projects include the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland and the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, Qatar. He won the Pritzker Prize, widely considered to be architecture\u2019s highest honor, in 1983.\n\nSandi Pei, the son of Eileen and I.M. Pei, sitting in the home, which is listed for $8 million.

They\u2019d built that property in the 1950s, a simple one-story glass pavilion that hovers above the ground on columns, their son said. Its interior measured just 30 by 60 feet, so the children would spend most of their time outside, while Mr. Pei sat reading on the screened-in porch. The Pei children have decided to keep that property, said Sandi.\n\nThe President\u2019s Cousin Laura Delano, center, traveling with Franklin Delano Roosevelt, her cousin. Photo: Everett Collection The previous owner of the Peis\u2019 home was Laura \u201cPolly\u201d Delano, the cousin of president Franklin D. Roosevelt. Her father, Warren Delano III and the president\u2019s mother, Sara Ann Delano Roosevelt, were siblings. Ms. Delano never married and she and another cousin, Margaret \u201cDaisy\u201d Suckley, were frequently by the side of the president and his wife, Eleanor Roosevelt. They stumped for him when he launched his campaign for president in the 1930s and were by his side when he died in 1945 in Warm Springs, Georgia. Ms. Delano was widely regarded as the more boisterous of the two unmarried women. \u201cShe was flamboyant, high-spirited and unpredictable. She also delighted in gossip though sometimes to the point of recklessness. As one member of the Delano family once put it, Polly \u2018was a law unto herself,\u2019 \u201d according to \u201cThe Last 100 Days: FDR at War and Peace,\u201d by David B. Woolner. Ms. Delano was also a breeder of Irish setters and dachshunds and served as a judge in dog shows.\n\nItems of Note in the Peis\u2019 Art Collection Auction The Peis\u2019 art will be sold at auctions in New York on November 12, in Hong Kong on November 23 and in Paris on December 3, according to Christie\u2019s.
