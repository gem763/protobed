(Image: Netflix, YouTube)\n\nNetflix\u2019s Disenchantment has dropped a new trailer to get us excited for its sophomore season.\n\nBy the end of the first season of Disenchantment, from The Simpsons and Futurama creator Matt Groening, things were in a pretty bad place. Dreamland was in disarray, one of Princess Bean\u2019s friends was dead, and her mother\u2019s return wasn\u2019t exactly a warm welcome. But, our booze-loving hero is working hard to set things right \u2014 by going from a bad place to The Bad Place, and even further to a land she dare never dream of.\n\nIn the first trailer for the follow-up to Disenchantment\u2019s mixed but ultimately promising debut season, Princess Bean (Abbi Jacobson) is still hurting after the death of her friend, Elfo, who she\u2019d chosen not to revive with a magic potion so she could bring her mother back to life.\n\nHowever, Bean\u2019s demon friend has an idea to bring Elfo back... of course, it means sending Elfo to hell so they can try and bust him out.You can watch the trailer below, or on Twitter.\n\nIn the meantime, Dreamland\u2019s people are still trapped in stone after Bean\u2019s mother cast a dangerous curse, and Bean and her father have to work together to save their people and restore their kingdom to its former glory. While Bean deals with her mother, and a prophecy that could mean the salvation or destruction of her entire way of life. Does this quest involve a trip on a dirigible, and a visit to what might be the coolest steampunk futuristic place, possibly ever? You bet your butt it does.\n\nNetflix also shared a new poster, showing Bean in that mysterious kingdom teased in the first season. But she\u2019s got Elfo\u2019s rescue on the brain.\n\nDisenchantment returns to Netflix with 10 episodes on September 20, and it\u2019s already renewed for another two-part season.", "description": "Netflix\u2019s Disenchantment has dropped a new trailer to get us excited for its sophomore season....", "authors": ["Nathan Grayson", "Alex Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/v1e4dol3kkpdtyj163fj.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
