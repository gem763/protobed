'I look back on photographs of myself when I was young [with big hair] and I think gosh, I took the long route to get back there.'\n\n'I went through those teenage years when everybody is searching to figure out who they are and all of a sudden become so aware of how they look,' the Black-ish star added. 'How they are seen, what\u2019s cool, what\u2019s in.'\n\nIt was not seeing representation in the industry that began her 'contentious relationship' with beauty.\n\nI'll do it myself: Growing up, she said, 'Sadly, there were not a tonne of images, outside of my family, of people who looked like me,' and found that the beauty industry needed more for curly, coily, textured hair\n\nEllis Ross said 'the culture of beauty that was around me, but didn\u2019t make space for me. As a result, I tried to beat my hair into submission to do what I thought it should do. I straightened it, I dyed it, I fried it.'\n\nAll of which led her to create Pattern, that caters to 3B-4C hair types (curly, coily and textured hair types).\n\nThe brand lunched in September, which Ellis Ross said was ten years in the making.\n\n'My initial reasoning for wanting to make these products was absolutely selfish. I was like, \"I need these, where are they?\" she said of creating the brand.\n\nCEO: She launched her Pattern haircare brand in September after facing 10 years of roadblocks\n\nShe found roadblocks to creating the brand and that she was 'running up against many of the things that were exactly what made me feel bad about myself.'\n\nEllis Ross found people questioning her credibility on the hair industry. To which she believes 'like many women of colour and people with curly hair, have become our best experts because the industry has not supported us.'\n\nThough she still find that women of color face 'an underestimation in terms of our worth, our deservingness and our beauty.'\n\nOutside of her beauty line she is bringing the Black-ish spinoff Mixed-ish to the screen, which is partly based on her life.\n\nMixed-ish airs Tuesday nights on ABC, right after Black-ish.", "description": "Tracee Ellis Ross discussed her journey with beauty and the struggle she faced getting her company on shelves.\nShe graces the cover of Glamour 's October digital issue.", "authors": ["Kellie Chudzinski For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/02/19469552-0-image-a-9_1570582943545.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
