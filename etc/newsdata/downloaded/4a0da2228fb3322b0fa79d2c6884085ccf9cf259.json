(Al Bello/Getty Images)\n\nIt\u2019s a bad month to be an NFL starting quarterback. It\u2019s an even worse month to be a New York Jets starting quarterback.\n\nThe latest signal caller to suffer a serious, season-ending injury is Trevor Siemian, who started for New York Monday night in place of Week 1 starter Sam Darnold. The 27-year-old Siemian\u2019s ankle bent awkwardly late in the team\u2019s 23-3 loss to the Cleveland Browns when Myles Garrett brought him down, earning a roughing-the-passer flag in the process. Although Siemian walked off the field, Coach Adam Gase later declared the injury \u201cugly\u201d and announced that the quarterback needs surgery to repair ligament damage.\n\nThis news came only five days after Gase announced that Darnold, the team\u2019s No. 1 quarterback, would miss at least one game and perhaps more with mononucleosis.\n\n[If Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger can\u2019t stay healthy, good luck to the NFL]\n\nSiemian joins the Steelers\u2019 Ben Roethlisberger on the shelf for the rest of the season, with the two-time Super Bowl winner needing elbow surgery. The Jaguars\u2019 Nick Foles is expected to return later in the season after having surgery for a broken collarbone. The Saints\u2019 Drew Brees is considering whether to have surgery to repair a thumb injury he suffered Sunday. Either way, he will be out for a few weeks. The Colts and Giants got off easy, in retrospect, when Andrew Luck retired and Eli Manning was benched.\n\nThe Jets now must find a backup for third-stringer Luke Falk, who replaced Siemian Monday night, with \u2014 wait for it \u2014 running back Le\u2019Veon Bell designated as his backup. The Jets are likely to sign a quarterback familiar with Gases\u2019s offense, someone like Brock Osweiler or David Fales, the New York Daily News\u2019 Manish Mehta reported.\n\nUntil Darnold is over mono, Falk will be the starter, with the Jets facing the New England Patriots on Sunday, already as a massive underdog. \u201cHe\u2019s feeling better \u2026,\" Gase told reporters of Darnold. \u201cThe doctors are letting us know how to proceed with him.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a brutal turn of events for the winless Jets, whose offense was embarrassing even before Siemian (3-for-6 passing for three yards) got hurt midway through the second quarter\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating, but this is the NFL,\u201d left tackle Kelvin Beachum said (via the Daily News). \u201cWe\u2019re in the world of suck right now.\u201d\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nEli Manning benched as Daniel Jones is named the Giants\u2019 starter\n\nThe Eli Manning benching was inevitable.
