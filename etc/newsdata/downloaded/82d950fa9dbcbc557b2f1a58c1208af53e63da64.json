Strolling along the pretty river bridges as part of a tapas and wine tour (we\u2019re joined by a delightful couple from Glasgow and an Australian woman travelling the Catalan region solo), we learn about its fascinating history.\n\nThe city has been besieged 25 times in its 2,000 years and conquered seven times. Jewish communities lived in the cramped alleys of the cobbled quarters, known as El Call, for centuries until they were expelled from Spain in 1492. The government recently began offering passports to any of their descendants who wished to return.\n\nAt our first tapas stop we\u2019re handed thin slices of salty pork, ranging from light pink with milky white strips of fat to muscular blood red, while we learn our Iberico from our Serrano. We\u2019re told Iberico black pigs are fed acorns for two years to lower their cholesterol, how three out of their four grandparents must have been Iberico and that the carcasses are kept underground in salt for one day per kilo of meat after being slaughtered. Butchers then fetch an impressive \u00a3730 per leg.\n\nSerrano ham is a staple in Girona and an important part of Spanish cuisine\n\nWhite pigs, meanwhile, which produce serrano ham (the most common in Girona) are cured for up to four years - the butcher smells each joint every day until the scent says they\u2019re ready.\n\nAfter a meaty start, we giddily hop between bars, gorging on squid ink black rice and more variations of croquettes than I\u2019d like to recall, our glasses of cava and red and white wine (sometimes all three at once) never less than half full.\n\nOur final stop is Rocambolesc Ice Cream parlour, owned by three brothers (Joan, Josep and Jordi) behind the restaurant El Celler de Can Roca. El Celler has three Michelin stars and has been twice ranked the best in the world.\n\nIt\u2019s quite the family business: Joan is the head chef, Josep is the sommelier and Jordi is in charge of desserts.\n\nThe spectacular Girona Cathedral, which featured in the hit HBO television series Game of Thrones\n\n\u2018The restaurant has a two year waiting list\u2019 our guide tells us. No need to wait for an ice cream. I go for chocolate encased in a steaming hot brioche buns \u2013 essentially an ice cream toastie. It\u2019s buttery, sweet and totally delicious.\n\nWe head back into the city centre the following morning and waddle through its warren of ancient streets bursting with quirky boutiques, arched stone vaults and pretty balconies, almost all of which are adorned with fluttering political flags.\n\nMany say \u2018Girona no est\u00e0 en venda\u2019 \u2013 Girona is not for sale. Landlords here have realised they can make more money from well-off Airbnb users than those who live and work in the city year-round.\n\nGirona is very much a university city: 15,000 of the 100,000 residents are students, many of who live in the ancient colourful flats that hang over the waters of the river Onyar which runs through the centre.\n\nWe pass the lofty cathedral, so attractive and medieval it appeared in Game of Thrones, and eventually plonk ourselves at a tapas bar in the handsome main square and watch gossiping locals propped up against shaded walls and children dressed in full Barcelona kit eating their daily dose of sticky gelato.\n\nHotel Camiral is a 15-minute drive from the city centre and popular with golf enthusiasts\n\nOne of the hotel's double rooms, where the bathrooms are stocked with Elemis products\n\nWe\u2019re staying at Hotel Camiral, a 15 minute drive from the centre, home to a 25-metre outdoor pool surrounded by swaying trees and comfortable green and white stripped sun loungers.\n\nIt\u2019s not the panoramic views or delicious Catalonian cuisine served up in its four restaurants that make the hotel so special, but the little things; Elemis hand wash and moisturiser is on tap in the chic pool bathroom, camphor and eucalyptus pillow spray is left on the bedside table each evening and green apples, headphones and refrigerated bottled water are on offer in the gym.\n\nPart of the PGA Catalunya Resort, the hotel is a golfer\u2019s paradise.\n\nAs it happens, Pep Guardiola, the Manchester City football coach - a keen golfer - is staying here with his family. I\u2019m told he visits several times a year, lucky chap.\n\nAt the very least, I\u2019m thankful to have planted a kiss on that stone carving.", "description": "Charming Girona, about 45-minutes north of  Barcelona, has an enthusiastic food scene, plenty of history and some quirky traditions.
