From there, she can stitch her bloody leg \u2013 we won\u2019t tell you exactly how \u2013 and witness other surfers get attacked.\n\nThe film has reaped twice as much as expected so far in the United States, and some critics are calling it the best shark movie since Jaws.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that great (Alfred) Hitchcock quote which I\u2019m going to paraphrase which is that the fear is never in the bang, it\u2019s in the anticipation thereof and that\u2019s what\u2019s fun about a movie like this. Every time that camera goes underwater and you\u2019re looking at somebody above water, that perspective is so chilling,\u201d Lively said.\n\nThis nail biting thriller has earned surprisingly strong reviews, including for Lively\u2019s performance, which carries the entire film.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an isolation film.
