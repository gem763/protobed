Their GM isn\u2019t worried.", "language": "en", "text": "Both players wanted deals that would make them the highest-paid at their respective positions. The Steelers\u2019 general manager had to study the numbers both on the field and in the salary cap to make two critical decisions for the franchise.\n\n\u201cI think last year at the running back position we had roughly 150 yards less production than the year before,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cSo the running back position was just as productive. When you take 100 catches out of your offense, the quarterback is not going have 100 less completions. Moving forward, who\u2019s going to take those make up the difference?\n\n\u201cJuJu Smith-Schuster is not going to catch 200 passes. The question is whether Vance McDonald is going to catch an extra 20. Is James Washington going to catch extra 40? And how many for Donte Moncrief? We will go through the year and we will find out.\u201d\n\nClayton: Division, wild card and Super Bowl picks for 2019 season\n\nColbert knows the Steelers\u2019 offense isn\u2019t as talented as it was two seasons ago, after losing one of the game\u2019s best receivers and one of its best running backs. But Pittsburgh still feels as though it can be an AFC contender this season, and recent NFL history is full of examples of teams that have improved their records even after losing talented contributors. Just last year, a Seattle Seahawks team that had recently parted with the likes of Richard Sherman ended up winning more games.\n\n\u201cI think we can be just as productive and just as dynamic because we have the quarterback in that spot,\u201d Colbert said.\n\nBen Roethlisberger is at the center of everything for the Steelers. He signed a two-year, $68 million extension ensuring he\u2019d be running the offense for the next three seasons, and a year after facilitating an offense that saw Smith-Schuster and Conner emerge as Pro Bowlers, he is once again critical to the team\u2019s Super Bowl hopes.\n\nBut the veteran quarterback also received criticism from Brown, who claimed Roethlisberger got special treatment \u2014 including from Colbert \u2014 that was bad for the other players on the roster. If Roethlisberger is key to the team\u2019s contender status, the last 10 months may also have served as a reminder for him, Colbert and the entire Steelers organization that they\u2019ll need more than just Big Ben to make a postseason run.\n\nThat includes a rookie linebacker for whom Colbert made a bold trade to move up in the draft, some key additions on defense and a lesser-known cast of skill-position players that Colbert feels will be elevated by playing with Roethlisberger.\n\nColbert is a big hockey fan and a season-ticket holder of the Pittsburgh Penguins. He\u2019s seen how guys like Mario Lemieux and Sidney Crosby can raise the level of play of their teammates.\n\n\u201cWhen you put players on a line with Sidney Crosby, they are all of a sudden more productive than when they have been somewhere else,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cYou can look at it in any sport. It\u2019s usually not the player himself, but how he performs within his unit on the team.\u201d\n\nCan the Steelers actually make this addition-by-subtraction thing work?\n\nThat has helped, Colbert says, with the team\u2019s impressive track record for drafting wide receivers. The Steelers might be the best team in the league at identifying talent at the position, and their past finds include Hines Ward, Mike Wallace, Emmanuel Sanders, Plaxico Burress, Brown and Smith-Schuster.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t do anything different in evaluating wide receivers,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cWe\u2019ve missed on a couple at that position, as many as we\u2019ve missed on other positions. We\u2019ve had some guys really turned into great players. I never sell short the fact when you come in with Hall of Fame-type quarterback, I think that helps.\u201d\n\nThat history may have contributed to Pittsburgh\u2019s comfort level will letting Bell leave in free agency and trading Brown to the Oakland Raiders for third- and fifth-round picks (although relationships with both players appeared beyond repair by that point, anyway), as did the upgrades to the roster they could make with the additional draft picks and cap room. They signed cornerback Steven Nelson to a three-year, $25.5 million contract, and he has already proven to be an upgrade in pass coverage. They also added linebacker Mark Barron and wide receiver Donte Moncrief on two-year pacts.\n\n\u201cWe were able to add some folks from the outside that you may not have been able to add,\u201d Colbert said.\n\nIn the draft, Colbert added a complementary running back (Benny Snell Jr.) and a wide receiver (Diontae Johnson). But the boldest move was his trade up to get inside linebacker Devin Bush at 10th overall, sending a 2019 second-rounder and 2020 third-rounder to the Denver Broncos.\n\n\u201cWhen you go into a draft, you identify six or seven player who, if you got to within their reach, you would try to trade up to get them,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cThis year, Devin was identified as one of those players.\u201d\n\nColbert said the team justified the cost to get Bush because of how important the role is that he will be asked to fill: a sideline-to-sideline linebacker the team has been missing since the injury to Ryan Shazier.\n\n\u201cYou know, the game has changed,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a vertical game as much as it is now a horizontal game. You have to be able to defend horizontally. It\u2019s different. When we drafted Ryan Shazier, we were probably ahead of the game with his ability to make plays sideline to sideline. When you lose a guy like him, hopefully you can replace him with a Devin Bush or a Mark Barron.\n\n\u201cNow we are much better equipped to defend modern NFL football than we were in recent years, because now we\u2019ve got two guys who can really cover.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen if the combination of Bush\u2019s arrival, the ascension of some younger players on offense and a revitalized Roethlisberger will be enough to lift the Steelers past the upstart Cleveland Browns and rebuilt Baltimore Ravens in the AFC North. But there should be opportunity in an AFC that appears thinner than in past years, and the Steelers seem excited by the prospect of sneaking up on those who assume the losses of Bell and Brown will derail their playoff hopes.\n\n\u201cI think every team has an identity,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cOn average you add 14 to 16 new players per year. When you take away dynamic producers, someone else has to produce. It doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be a better team. We were 9-6-1 and a non-playoff team [last season], so we\u2019re hopeful the group we have for 2019 is better than that. That\u2019s not acceptable for us.\u201d\n\nAround the NFL\n\n\u2014 Seattle Seahawks general manager John Schneider might have jumped ahead in the race for NFL executive of the year after completing the Jadeveon Clowney trade last weekend. He acquired a Pro Bowl pass-rusher for two backups (Barkevius Mingo and Jacob Martin) and a third-round pick. The most stunning part is the Houston Texans are paying $7 million of Clowney\u2019s $15.9 million one-year deal.\n\nFor roughly the $17 million franchise tag fee the Seahawks freed themselves of by trading Frank Clark to the Kansas City Chiefs, Seattle now has two Pro Bowl-caliber defensive ends in Clowney and Ezekiel Ansah. On top of that, the Clark trade allowed the Seahawks to turn four draft picks into 11.\n\nPass rush was the worry for the team this season. With Clowney and Ansah, the Seahawks have gone from a nine-win team to possibly challenging the Los Angeles Rams for the NFC West title.\n\n\u2014 Miami Dolphins Coach Brian Flores can say that his team isn\u2019t tanking, but the Dolphins, after cutting long-snapper John Denny Monday, are down to two players who have been to the Pro Bowl: cornerback Xavien Howard and safety Reshad Jones. There isn\u2019t a starter on the offensive line that was drafted higher than the third round.\n\n\u2014 While Houston Texans Coach Bill O\u2019Brien is taking heat for the Clowney trade, and he may have overpaid for left tackle Laremy Tunsil, there should be short-term value to the Tunsil addition. Last year, O\u2019Brien needed to keep quarterback Deshaun Watson\u2019s pass attempts to fewer than 30 per game because of how poor the pass protection was. In an AFC South that is wide open following Andrew Luck\u2019s retirement, the Texans, with an improved offensive line, have a chance to contend.\n\n\u2014 Backup quarterback remains a thin position. There are currently eight teams with backups who have zero or one career start. It was a smart move by the Indianapolis Colts to sign Brian Hoyer to a three-year, $12 million contract.\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nDaniel Snyder dreamed of owning the Redskins.
