Did you know this is really unprecedented? This is the worst time we've ever had a situation like this. They're trying to figure out, no joke, is it the DC police that goes and gets them?\" Tlaib said. \"Where do we hold them? Like, I'm not in those kinds of conversations but I'm asking, what happens?\"\n\n\"I'm telling you, they're trying to be like, 'Well where are we going put them? Where are we going to hold...'\" she continued, suggesting they can be held in Detroit. \"What happens when they don't comply? The fact of the matter is we held Barr and Secretary Ross from Commerce, the Secretary of Commerce, in contempt. Well, what happens if they continue to not comply?\"\n\nAs a reminder, Tlaib was one of the first Democrats to call for impeachment of President Trump immediately after she was elected in 2018. She infamously said she was going to \"impeach the motherf*cker.\"\n\nBefore becoming a member of Congress Tlaib, kicking and screaming, was escorted out of a speech by President Trump.", "description": ".10/04/2019 12:53:50PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Guy Benson", "Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/228/3e42302a-f01f-4b97-a2d8-4303eec01946.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
