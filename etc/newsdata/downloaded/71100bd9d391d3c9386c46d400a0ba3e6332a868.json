And then an almighty row kicked off. I care about Omar, and, though obviously I have never met her, by proxy I care about his tiny baby in a hospital ward.\n\nSince most of us are born in the NHS and proud of it, we are wildly, if rationally, emotional about babies in NHS hospitals. When the care is brilliant we think that our health service that cradles us is a miracle. When it goes wrong we feel national shame. We get as angry as Omar did.\n\nSo seeing Omar\u2019s anger at the prime minister about a lack of doctors and enough nurses \u2013 that burnt. Then I realised. It shouldn't be Omar - or any dad of a sick child - who should be shouting at Boris Johnson. It should be me. It should be the 649 members of the House of Commons whose job it is to hold him to account.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIf parliament wasn\u2019t prorogued and MPs had voted to cancel recess as was expected, the PM could have been questioned on the NHS by elected representatives from all parties in PMQs hours after his encounter with Omar.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

That will not be the case though where the prime minister and other government ministers carry out staged press visits and give speeches without taking questions.\n\nChannel News Fact check has reported that for the visit to the hospital where Boris met my friend Omar, the press had agreed to film but not ask any questions. John Humphreys on his recent retirement also lamented the failure of the prime minister to do in-depth interviews. This is not the way democracy should work. Holding the government to account clearly can\u2019t be left only to the media.\n\nAdditionally, if it wasn\u2019t for Brexit, we would in fact be engaged in the proper business of British politics: the concerns of tiny babies in NHS wards and their parents. This issue would be the subject of extended debate where it ought to be - the floor of the House of Commons.\n\nI am proud of my friend Omar for what he did. I am proud to have campaigned alongside him. But I am not proud that British politics has come to this. MPs should be in parliament holding Boris Johnson to account. Omar's girl, my girl, all our girls and our kids deserve nothing less.\n\nAlison McGovern is the Labour MP for Wirral South", "description": "The prime minister ran into my friend Omar Salem this week during a publicity visit with a press pack to the hospital ward where Omar\u2019s daughter was being treated.
