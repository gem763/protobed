The Supreme Court could potentially rule against Johnson and compel Parliament to return. Still, the Johnson administration could immediately seek a new, shorter prorogation of Parliament.\n\nThe Supreme Court could also rule for Johnson, giving its blessing to his suspension of Parliament.\n\n\u201cIf prorogation is ruled unlawful, Parliament would likely return. This would likely make it difficult for Mr. Johnson to continue on his current negotiating strategy, especially given recent comments by the EU, expediting moves towards an extension and a general election,\u201d said analysts at Citi in a note to clients.\n\nElection polls place the Johnson-led Conservatives with a high single-digit lead ahead of the Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour.\n\nAnalysts at J.P. Morgan said Johnson could resign if a ruling went against him, which it deemed would be \u201cmodestly GBP-positive.\u201d\n\nThe British pound GBPUSD, -0.3527% has been turbulent since Johnson became prime minister in late July, but of late has held the $1.24 level. Generally, the U.K. currency moves higher when traders assess a diminished chance of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe betting site Betfair on Monday afternoon implied a 25% chance of a no-deal Brexit in 2019.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.K. government bond TMBMKGB-10Y, -12.43% , or gilt, meanwhile has dropped this month from a high of 0.76% to 0.54% on Monday.", "description": "The U.K. Supreme Court on Tuesday is scheduled to release its ruling on whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson lawfully prorogued Parliament.", "authors": ["Steve Goldstein", "European Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR853_uksupr_ZG_20190923105541.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
