Apparently this dude was the absolute worst during True's birthday party\u2014not only attempting to kiss Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian the night before despite her showing zero interest, but also confronting Kanye West.\n\nDuring the Sunday night premiere of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, we saw Tristan and Kanye talking somewhat tensely with no audio (wow, WAY TO FAIL US, E!). And according to Kanye, Tristan was pissed about how he got portrayed in Keeping Up with the Kardashians last season. Especially due to the use of Kanye's son \"Runaway\" in the explosive cheating scandal-themed KUWTK trailer.\n\nAnd reminder, the lyrics go:\n\n\"Let\u2019s have a toast for the douchebags\n\nLet\u2019s have a toast for the assholes\n\nLet\u2019s have a toast for the scumbags\n\nEvery one of them that I know\n\nLet\u2019s have a toast for the jerkoffs\n\nThat\u2019ll never take work off\n\nBaby, I got a plan\n\nRun away fast as you can\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe felt like we were using my music to reinforce, like, his narrative,\u201d Kanye explained, a revelation that naturally infuriated Khlo\u00e9, who ended up leaving the party in tears. Her thoughts on the matter? \u201cI don\u2019t need at my daughter\u2019s birthday party for any of this to be a discussion.\"\n\nLike, FAIR.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Wow, great timing as usual.", "authors": ["Mehera"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/K6J15CNsT8sEc.crADeA9g--~B/aD02NDA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/0809e929b0cf7897faa6f97e5d3d75ab", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
