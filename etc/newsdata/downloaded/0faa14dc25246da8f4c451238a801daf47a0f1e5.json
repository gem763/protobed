Econoday shows consensus estimates for September employment slightly lower at 145,000.\n\nThe data hold particular significance after reports about American factory activity showed evidence of contraction in September , with the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing report on Tuesday showing the weakest reading in about a decade (link) and an ISM non-manufacturing report on Thursday, coming in at 52.6% (link) -- the weakest level in about three years.\n\nThe survey reports have underscored the damage caused by the trade war with China. The spat has raised the cost of supplies, disrupted supply chains and hurt exports.\n\nOn top of that, private-sector data from Automatic Data Processing Inc. on Wednesday estimating that the American private sector created 135,000 for the month was weaker-than expected, raising red flags that a U.S. recession may be around the corner.\n\nHow the market reacts to the jobs number, however, are difficult to predict, as solid numbers may suggest the U.S. central bank will be less inclined to trim borrowing costs.\n\n\"If jobs numbers meet or beat expectations, it will be welcome news for the US economy but will undermine the case for more aggressive easing from the Fed,\" wrote Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group.\n\nFederal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida late Thursday played down the chances of a near-term recession. He said the risk remains low \"with appropriate monetary policy,\" speaking at a question-and-answer session sponsored by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nClarida offered no explicit forward guidance about whether the Fed would cut rates again at its meeting on Oct. 29-30.\n\n\"We think poor US economic data poses downside risk to stocks and the dollar while the Fed maintains the current modest stance on easing policy,\" Lawler said.\n\nHowever, the market is pricing in a greater than 90% chance that the central bank cuts interest rates later this month by 25 basis points, which would represent the third cut in as many policy meetings, according to CME Group data based on federal-funds futures.\n\nThe jobs report is set to be released at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, with data on international trade also coming at that same time.\n\nA parade of other Fed speakers are set, headlined by a 2 p.m. talk from Powell, where he will deliver opening remarks about employment and price stability at a Fed hosted event.\n\nBefore that, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren will appear at 8:30 a.m. at an event in his home region, Atlanta Fed boss Raphael Bostic will speak at 10:25 a.m. in New Orleans, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari will talk at 12:45 p.m. at an event in his district. Capping off the Friday appearances are Fed Gov. Lael Brainard, who will moderate a panel at 2:10 p.m., and Fed Vice-Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles, who moderates a panel at 4 p.m.\n\nHow are other markets trading?\n\nU.S. Treasury yields extended their slide on Friday. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 1.525% after 6 basis-point skid to 1.531% on Thursday.\n\nGold prices inched higher were higher after settling higher on Thursday. Gold for December delivery picked up 0.1% to $1,514.90 an ounce on Comex.\n\nU.S. oil futures were inching lower, as worries over global demand persist. West Texas Intermediate crude-oil for November delivery gave up 2 cents, or less than 0.1%, to $52.42 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n\nIn Asia overnight Wednesday, the Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 1.1% as Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam banned protesters from wearing masks in a hardening of the government's stance on the territory's most disruptive crisis since it reverted to Chinese rule in 1997. The mask ban takes effect Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, Japan's Nikkei 225 meanwhile, gained 0.3% after a 2% fall on Thursday. European stocks traded mixed, with the Stoxx Europe 600 up 0.2%.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 04, 2019 07:18 ET (11:18 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
