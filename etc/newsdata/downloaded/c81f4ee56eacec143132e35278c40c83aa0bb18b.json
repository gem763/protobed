He previously found one that impacted the SupportAssist app that comes pre-installed on Dell systems.", "description": "HP releases security update for HP Touchpoint Analytics app. Device owners advised to update.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/30/28ff99e1-16a7-4a58-b1cf-f71f6b3952da/thumbnail/770x578/fe532f20d8645a94ae23b49109d9382c/hp-chromebook-14a-g5-ports.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
