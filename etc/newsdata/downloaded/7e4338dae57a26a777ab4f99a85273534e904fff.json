Weiss' show ended. However, none of the other projects appear to be moving forward either.\n\nOne report in September suggested that HBO was nearing a pilot commitment for a project based on George R. R. Martin's companion book \"Fire & Blood,\" which tells the stories of the Targaryen kings who had long ruled Westeros.\n\nRepresentatives for HBO declined to comment.\n\nThe news comes just months after \"Game of Thrones\" aired its critically-panned final season.\n\nHBO has always been known for its heavily curated content. Shows like \"Vinyl\" and \"Hung\" got the ax despite millions of dollars worth of investment and critical acclaim because they were not as strongly received by viewers as other shows.\n\nThe premium cable service has put much of its production power behind new shows like \"Watchmen,\" which debuted earlier this month to favorable reviews from critics, as well as new seasons of \"Westworld,\" \"Barry\" and \"Last Week Tonight.\"\n\nCurrently in production is \"Lovecraft Country,\" a show from the minds of Jordan Peele (\"Us\") and J.J. Abrams (\"Lost\"), based on Matt Ruff's novel of the same name.\n\n\"Lovecraft Country\" is a horror drama that follows Atticus Black, his uncle George and Letitia Dandridge as they travel across 1950s Jim Crow America in search of Black's father. On their trek, the three must overcome racist terrors, but also monsters ripped straight from the pages of H.P. Lovecraft's prose.\n\nThe show, which is still in production, is expected to be marketed heavily by HBO next year.\n\nRead the full report from Variety.", "description": "The much anticipated \"Game of Thrones\" prequel staring Naomi Watts will not be coming to HBO.
