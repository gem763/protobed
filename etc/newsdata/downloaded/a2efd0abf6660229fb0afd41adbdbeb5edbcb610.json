And if they are, it was a tough way to go.\n\nThe Australians were handed a lesson in how to defend by England in a record-tying loss to their bitter rival. Prop Kyle Sinckler was able to carve through a yawning gap in the Wallabies\u2019 defensive line for England\u2019s third try, and his first at international level.\n\nThen there was the Australian attack that was often poorly executed and at times overambitious. Kurtley Beale attempted a chip kick from deep inside his own 22 in the first half that was gathered up by England winger Jonny May, who went hunting for his third try of the match.\n\nTwo of England\u2019s four tries came from interceptions. Australia also turned down a kick at goal from in front of the posts in the 56th minute in favor of an attacking scrum, even though the score was only 27-16 to England at that point.\n\n\u201cThat is the way we play footy,\u201d Cheika said. \u201cI am not going to a kick-and-defend game. Call me naive but that\u2019s not what I am doing. I would rather win playing our way, that\u2019s the way Aussies want us to play.\u201d\n\nIt has been a turbulent five years under Cheika, who got the Wallabies to a World Cup final in 2015 - defying most people\u2019s pre-tournament predictions - but has seen his team fail to kick on since then.\n\nAustralia has only been good in patches in this World Cup cycle, one of its most notable wins being that 47-26 thrashing of New Zealand in August when it scored six tries to run up the highest tally of points in 165 tests against the All Blacks.\n\nNew Zealand might have been playing with only 14 men for the second half that game but it highlighted Australia\u2019s potential that just wasn\u2019t realized at the World Cup in Japan.\n\n\u201cWe have come to the tournament and played, over the last two years, our best rugby,\u201d Cheika said.\n\n\u201cYou could say it came down to a few key moments. Everything was pretty tight.\u201d\n\nYet the story of the World Cup doesn\u2019t exactly make pretty reading for Cheika and the Wallabies, who were trailing to Fiji at halftime in their pool opener before eventually winning 39-21 and then lost 29-25 to Wales. After perfunctory victories over Uruguay and Georgia, Australia was overwhelmed by England in the quarterfinals.\n\n\u201cI am gutted, absolutely gutted,\u201d Australia captain Michael Hooper said. \u201cThere are a lot of players who won\u2019t get another chance at a World Cup and some guys have done a lot of work to get into this squad.\n\n\u201cI certainly feel that weight as well of not being able to get our team across the line.\u201d\n\nWhile Hooper will be back for Australia, the same cannot be said of Cheika, who staked his job on the World Cup in Japan and said this year he would walk if he didn\u2019t win it.\n\n\u201cWhen the time comes, I\u2019ll tell them,\u201d Cheika said, pressed again about his future as Australia coach. \u201cThey don\u2019t need to know today.\u201d\n\nIt seems, though, a matter of when, not if, Cheika departs.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Michael Cheika didn't take too kindly to the question, although he must have known it was coming.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Douglas"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
