Catholic Register (@NCRegister) October 4, 2019\n\nVATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis witnessed an indigenous performance at a tree-planting ceremony in the Vatican Gardens Friday during which people held hands and bowed before carved images of pregnant women.\n\nA group of people, including Amazonians in ritual dress, as well as people in lay clothes and a Franciscan brother, knelt and bowed in a circle around images of two semi-naked pregnant women in the presence of the Pope and members of the Curia.\n\nAfter witnessing the ritual, Pope Francis set aside his prepared remarks, opting instead to offer the Our Father without comment.\n\nThe ceremony in the Vatican Gardens \u2014 organized by the Global Catholic Climate Movement, Pan-Amazonian Ecclesial Network, and the Order of Franciscan Friars Minor \u2014 was described as a celebration of the feast of St. Francis and the opening of the Synod of Bishops on the Pan-Amazon Region Oct. 6-27.\n\nParticipants sang and held hands while dancing in a circle around the images. The dance resembled the pago a la tierra, a traditional offering to Mother Earth common among indigenous peoples in some parts of South America. No explanation was provided by the event organizers as to why the dance was performed for the feast of St. Francis or what it symbolized.\n\nPope Francis remained seated in a chair outside the group throughout the ceremony.\n\nA representative from the Vatican Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development said after the event that the dicastery\u2019s officials were invited to attend the event, but neither organized nor promoted it.\n\nPeople carried bowls of dirt from different places around the world, each symbolizing a different issue from ecological devastation to migration. The dirt was placed around a tree from Assisi, which was planted as a \u201csymbol of integral ecology.\u201d\n\nAfter what appeared to be the offering of prayers by participants, who prostrated themselves on the grass around a blanket upon which fruit, candles and several carved items were set, an indigenous woman approached the Pope and presented him with a black ring, which appeared identical to the one she was wearing.\n\nThe ring appeared to be a tucum ring, a black ring worn in Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America as a sign of dedication to certain social causes and often associated with \u201cliberation theology\u201d advocate Bishop Pedro Casald\u00e1liga.\n\nThe Vatican declined to comment on the ring.\n\nOne of the statues was presented to Pope Francis, by a woman who referred to it as \"Our Lady of the Amazon.\" The Pope blessed the statue.\n\nBefore the Pope\u2019s decision not to offer his prepared remarks, Cardinal Peter Turkson, prefect of the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development, spoke about Francis\u2019 environmental encyclical, Laudato Si.\n\n\u201cNot only is our environment deteriorating globally, little effort is also made to safeguard the moral conditions for an authentic human ecology,\u201d Cardinal Turkson said.\n\n\u201cGod\u2019s word transformed \u2018chaos\u2019 at the dawn of creation into a \u2018cosmos,\u2019 an ordered world system, capable of supporting human life and suitable to be home for man,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the lesson here is simple: \u2018Chaos\u2019 with the word of God becomes \u2018cosmos.\u2019 Conversely, \u2018cosmos\u2019 without God\u2019s word turns into \u2018chaos.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis story is developing and has been updated.", "description": "", "authors": ["Courtney Grogan Cna"], "top_image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/Tree_planting_Vatican_gardens_Oct._3_Vatican_Media_Register.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
