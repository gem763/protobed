Records show the plane was inspected in January, but it is not clear whether inspectors found any issues. Homendy said they are also trying to determine whether the plane experienced any problems before takeoff Wednesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHomendy\u2019s update came as Connecticut state officials released the names of the seven people who died after the Boeing B-17 bomber crashed as it was trying to land at Bradley International Airport. Six people \u2014 five on the plane and one on the ground \u2014 also were injured in the crash.\n\nReleasing the names, James Rovella, commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, asked that the families be shown \u201cthe utmost respect and dignity.\u201d\n\nThe victims include a retired police officer and the plane\u2019s pilot and co-pilot. The oldest was 75, the youngest 48.\n\nThose who died are the plane\u2019s pilot, Ernest McCauley, 75, of Long Beach, Calif.; co-pilot, Michael Foster, 71, of Jacksonville, Fla.; passengers David Broderick, 56, of West Springfield, Mass.; Gary Mazzone, 66, of Broad Brook, Conn.; James Roberts, 48, of Ludlow, Mass.; Robert Riddell, 59, of East Granby, Conn.; and Robert Rubner, 64, of Tolland, Conn.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn some cases, Rovella said, the bodies were badly burned, making it difficult for the state\u2019s medical examiner to make positive identifications for at least two victims. However, the passenger manifests have helped them determine who was on the plane. Of the six people who were injured, three have been released, hospital officials said.\n\nMazzone was a retired police captain with the Vernon Police Department, where he served for 22 years. After retiring, he worked as an inspector with the Connecticut Division of Criminal Justice. He was active with Special Olympics Connecticut and was part of the group\u2019s hall of fame.\n\n\u201cCaptain Mazzone had a distinguished career and was a graduate of the FBI National Academy,\u201d Capt. John Kelley said in a note sent to officers. \u201cHe will be missed by his family, friends and co-workers.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRovella credited quick action by first responders. He also said one passenger, a member of Connecticut\u2019s National Guard, played a key role in saving his fellow passengers.\n\nThe plane left Bradley Airport around 9:45 a.m. Wednesday and was in the air for only a few minutes when its crew messaged the control tower and said it was experiencing engine trouble, Homendy said. The plane circled back but hit several approach lights as it attempted to land, she said. Images of the crash on television and social media showed flames and huge plumes of black smoke at the site of the crash.\n\nHomendy said McCauley, the plane\u2019s pilot, had flown for the Collings Foundation, which is based in Massachusetts, for 20 years. He had over 7,300 hours in the B-17, reportedly the highest of any pilot in the United States. He also served as the foundation\u2019s safety officer. Foster, the first officer, had been a volunteer at the foundation for five years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe B-17 bomber, dubbed the \u201cFlying Fortress,\u201d was at the Bradley airport as part of a special display of vintage aircraft sponsored by the Collings Foundation. As part of the event, members of the public could fly on the B-17 in exchange for a donation. The plane was built in 1944 and acquired by the foundation in 1986.\n\nIn a statement posted on its website, the foundation said it is fully cooperating with officials to determine the cause of the crash and would comment further when more details are known:\n\n\u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with those who were on that flight and we will be forever grateful to the heroic efforts of the first responders at Bradley.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the Federal Aviation Administration, there are 16 Boeing B-17 aircraft registered in the United States.\n\nHomendy said there have been 21 accidents involving World War II-era bombers since 1982, in which 23 people have died. Three of those involved B-17 aircraft but not the plane that crashed Wednesday.\n\nAD\n\nShe said the B-17 involved in Wednesday\u2019s fatal crash had been involved in two previous incidents. In 1987, it overran a runway at an air show in western Pennsylvania, and in 1995, its landing gear failed to deploy at event in Nebraska.\n\nNTSB officials are expected to spend seven to 10 days at the crash site and will issue a preliminary report shortly after. Homendy said it will take 12 to 18 months for the full investigation to be completed.\n\nAD", "description": "Officials with the National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the investigation into the crash of the World War II-era plane, said they have been able to recover the plane\u2019s wings, engines and tail.", "authors": ["Lori Aratani", "Reporter Focusing On Transportation Issues", "Including Airports", "Airlines", "The Nation'S Railroad", "Subway Systems"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_oDaVnVOYGxCOIkoEMPEZCf23_8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YJGZUWHGC4I6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg"}
