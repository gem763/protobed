It became arguably the most iconic brand in Sony\u2019s history, with hundreds of devices bearing the name and continuing to be released today.\n\nTo celebrate the Walkman\u2019s legacy, Sony held an exhibit in Tokyo until this week called \u201cWalkman in the Park.\u201d The venue is Ginza Sony Park, a new public space that sits on the site of the iconic old Sony building that was recently demolished; another Sony building will be constructed here next year.\n\nI\u2019m no stranger to seeing a bunch of awesome old Sony products on display, but Walkman in the Park was a little different. The focus was on the experience of actually using the products and how they made you feel. You could listen to music on cassettes through cheap plastic headphones while reading quotes from people who used that Walkman at the time, and for a second feel like you were back in the \u201880s.\n\nAnd it started, of course, with a giant statue of a yellow Sports Walkman FM.\n\nThe layout of the exhibit was inspired by a skate park. You could sit on a ramp and listen to early hip-hop on an original TPS-L2.\n\nPerhaps because we live in a world of vanishing headphone jacks, the TPS-L2\u2019s dual output was frequently highlighted.\n\nThe \u201cWalkman Wall\u201d featured almost every player imaginable.\n\nThis installation connects a TPS-L2 to a newer digital Walkman and Sony\u2019s excellent WH-1000XM3 noise-canceling headphones. To what end, I am not entirely sure.", "description": "Sony\u2019s Walkman in the Park exhibit in Tokyo celebrates 40 years of Walkman portable music players, with dozens of devices on display and available to use.", "authors": ["Sam Byford", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZC2_wpxBFCIlwuD2S6FPd8cOxjs=/0x40:2040x1108/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19138468/DSCF7078.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-30"}
