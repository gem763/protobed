Only 44 made it to the finish, while five sank and 66 pulled out.\n\nSix sailors died and 55 were plucked from their yachts.\n\nThe Ice Bowl\n\nThe 1967 NFL championship game between the Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers was played in such atrocious conditions that it gave birth to safety rules to prevent players and fans being exposed to such extreme weather again.\n\nThe temperature was a freezing -26 Celsius (-15F) with a wind chill factor of -44C.\n\nThe whistles stuck to the referees' lips with one ripping his skin off, and calling plays by shouting through bleeding lips.\n\nFor the record, Packers legend Bart Starr scored a touchdown with 13 seconds remaining to win the game.\n\nBritain's big freeze\n\nThe third round of English football's 1963 FA Cup lasted 66 days as Britain was hit by a major freeze. Frost and snow, as well as power cuts, rain and mud were responsible for 261 postponements, with 16 of the 32 ties called off 10 or more times. The round was ultimately spread over 22 playing days.\n\nHail hits the Tour\n\n\n\nIn this year's Tour de France, the last 30 kilometres of stage 19 were cancelled when a powerful hailstorm hit the Alps, blanketing the road and giving organisers had no time to clear the course before the race leaders arrived.\n\nThe following day, stage 20 was shortened by 71 kilometres because of landslides caused by storm weather.\n\nRugby's 'water polo Test'\n\n\n\nOfficials considered postponing the 1975 New Zealand-Scotland Test because Eden Park was underwater, but with Scotland due to fly home the next day they decided to play.\n\nTorrential rain never let up in the so-called \"water polo Test\" and All Blacks prop Billy Bush said he feared someone would drown.\n\nDespite radio messages imploring fans to stay safely at home, 45 000 turned up to see the All Blacks win 24-0.\n\nThe wet World Cup\n\n\n\nThe 1995 World Cup semi-final between South Africa and France was delayed an hour after treacherous rain flooded the field in Durban.\n\nPeople were handed mops and brooms to help clear the water enough for the game to go ahead, which was fortunate for the Springboks, the hosts, who won and went on to beat New Zealand in the final.\n\nHad the match been abandoned, France would have made the final because of their better disciplinary record which was the tie-breaker then.\n\nBitter chill\n\n\n\nFor current French players Louis Picamoles and Wesley Fofana, this is not the first time they have faced weather disruption.\n\nIn 2012 they were at Stade de France for the Six Nations match against Ireland which was called off 10 minutes before kick-off because of a bitter chill and the referee feared for the players' safety on the frozen ground.\n\nWhen the match was eventually played three weeks later, it resulted in a 17-17 draw.", "description": "After an approaching typhoon prompted the cancellation of two games at the RWC, here are some other examples of extreme weather disruption in sports:", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9460/1d6252e3b0a144cabc49f1635e8327f6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
