However, BTC is still here and doesn\u2019t look to be going anywhere. Here are a few reasons why bitcoin was and continues to be, a solid investment.\n\nThe Bitcoin \u201cBubble\u201d refuses to Pop\n\nBitcoin, since it\u2019s launch in 2009, the price has been rising. Other famous bubbles like tulip mania in the 1600s have lasted for only a few years, whereas BTC has been going strong for over a decade now. Not only has the price increased, but the trading volume per day has also grown just as exponentially.\n\nBitcoin also has been one of the safest assets to invest in over the past ten years. If you dollar cost averaged buying BTC weekly, there isn\u2019t a single year where you wouldn\u2019t make a return on your investment.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrency has fundamentally changed the financial world. Previously, investing was something only licensed venture capitalists could do. Regular people were completely unable to get in on groundbreaking, up and coming technology. bitcoin has leveled the playing field, allowing anyone with an internet connection to make big gains.\n\nBTC vs the world\n\nBuying bitcoin has also outperformed every single major tech stocks in past years. In terms of percent return on investment, BTC has done nearly 40x better from 2013 \u2013 2019 verses the top tech stocks since 2009.\n\nWhen comparing bitcoin to global currencies, BTC ranks roughly 25th in the world in terms of market cap. This puts BTC just ahead of some fiat currencies like the Colombian Peso and New Zealand\u2019s dollar.\n\nMany people say bitcoin is dead because it\u2019s dropped half of its value in the past year and a half. However, you could also say BTC has increased tenfold over the past three years. Short term, its safe to assume the price of crypto-currencies will continue to be extremely volatile. But one thing is for sure, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies aren\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nWhere do you see BTC going for the rest of the year? Will we see a similar pattern to the past, or will Bitcoin shake things up?
