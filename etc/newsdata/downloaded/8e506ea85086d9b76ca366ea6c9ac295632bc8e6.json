It is a misery we must endure for the rest of our lives\u201d.\n\nThe grief-stricken mum described her daughter as \u201cthe love of our lives\u201d and said she was \u201cwild, wonderful, electric\u201d.\n\nThe girl was killed days after she was reported missing in May last year.\n\n\u201cWe agonised for so many years through the adoption process waiting for her,\u201d Geraldine Kriegel\u2019s statement said.\n\n\u201cShe brought us everything we dreamed of for all those years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe happiest day of our lives was 10 August 2006, the day the court declared we could become Ana\u2019s parents.\u201d\n\n(Image: Colin Keegan)\n\n(Image: Colin Keegan)\n\nShe described the \u2018panic, the dread, the agonising wait\u2019 when Ana went missing in Lucan, Co Dublin.\n\n\u201cOn Monday 14 May, Ana didn\u2019t come home. The cold fear we felt knowing she was in danger. Something or someone prevented her coming home.\u201d\n\n\u201cHours turned into days. We didn\u2019t know where she was or what happened to her, but somebody did. Somebody knew.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe saddest day of our lives was 17 May. Words no parents ever wants to hear: \u2018We are so sorry\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur precious little girl\u2019s body was found. There\u2019s no way to describe how that feels.\n\n(Image: Collins Photo Agency)\n\n\u201cNobody could understand the evil laying in wait for her. How could any child imagine in their worst nightmares the danger that lay ahead? She wanted to live and she was not permitted to do that. Our lives have been destroyed.\u201d\n\n\u201cImagine the terror, the pain she endured,\u201d she said. \u201cThat will live with us all our lives. We lie awake at night thinking about when she realised she was going to be killed, the horrendous and sadistic violation of her pure and innocent body.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo think she was left to rot for three days, it\u2019s unbearable. It\u2019s unhuman.\u201d\n\nThe hearing continues in Dublin.\n\nThe boys will be sentenced either later this afternoon or at a later date.", "description": "Ana Kri\u00e9gel was murdered by two 14-year-old boys in Lucan, Co Dublin", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Colin Keegan", "Collins Photo Agency"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14978676.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Krigel-17-05-18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
