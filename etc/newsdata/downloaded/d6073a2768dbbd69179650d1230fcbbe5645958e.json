I don't have to worry that much about a recession. It's about as idiosyncratic as long as you could imagine,\" he said.\n\nEisman is managing director and senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman. He's renowned for his bet against the subprime mortgage debt that helped spark the 2008 financial crisis. His story became the basis of Michael Lewis' book, \"The Big Short,\" which also became a movie.\n\nEisman told CNBC he doesn't see looming economic issues beyond the global industrial recession, which he says is not the same thing as a recession.\n\nThese days his short positions include Tesla, Deutsche Bank, and Zillow, which he calls \"the most flawed business model he's ever seen.\"", "description": "Steve Eisman, an investor best known for shorting stocks, says he's betting long on a Schaumburg, Illinois-based company that provides communications systems for law enforcement and emergency responders.", "authors": ["Al Lewis"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105221557-IMG_7670.JPG?v=1565287633", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
