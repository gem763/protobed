(AP Photo/Francisco Seco)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on Brexit developments (all times local):\n\n1:35 p.m.\n\nA Scottish court has rejected an attempt by anti-Brexit campaigners to order Prime Minister Boris Johnson to seek a delay to Britain's departure from the European Union, saying the government has already promised to abide by a law ordering it to do just that.\n\nParliament has passed a law that compels the government to ask the EU to postpone Brexit if no divorce deal has been agreed by Oct. 19.\n\nJohnson insists he won't do that \u2014 but also says he will obey the law. It's unclear how the two statements can be reconciled.\n\nCampaigners asked Scotland's Court of Session to order Johnson to comply.\n\nBut judge Paul Cullen said Johnson had confirmed in writing that \"he accepts that he must comply with the requirements of the 2019 Act.\"\n\n___\n\n12:20 p.m.\n\nThe Dutch government says proposals by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson need \"more realism and clarity\" if they stand any chance of staving off a chaotic no-deal Brexit at the end of the month.\n\nDutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said after meeting Johnson's Brexit envoy Stephen Barclay on Monday that \"important questions still remain.\"\n\nHe insisted the Netherlands stood fully behind EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.\n\nThe EU's executive Commission said that Johnson needs to rid himself of all elements in his proposal that are based on \"untried and revocable arrangements\" that would spill over into a transition period after a deal is found.\n\nEU officials have been sharply critical of a proposal that would give a regional legislature in Northern Ireland an effective veto on key elements of the Irish border arrangements in the future and of customs proposals based on technology that is still being tested.\n\nThe EU is expecting workable proposals by the end of the week so they have time to prepare next week's EU summit.\n\n___\n\n10:30 a.m.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson is making phone calls to other European Union leaders as he tries to overcome opposition to his Brexit deal.\n\nThe EU has responded coolly to a U.K. plan to maintain an open Irish border after Britain leaves the 28-nation bloc. Both sides have agreed there must be no checks or infrastructure along the border between EU member Ireland and the U.K.'s Northern Ireland. Under the U.K. plan there would be customs checks, but Britain says they could be conducted away from the border.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has said the EU will decide by the end of the week whether an amicable divorce deal is possible.\n\nJohnson is urging the bloc to compromise and says Britain will leave the EU on the scheduled date of Oct. 31, with or without a deal.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit", "description": "A Scottish court has rejected an attempt by anti-Brexit campaigners to order Prime Minister Boris Johnson to seek a delay to Britain's departure from the European Union, saying the government has already promised to abide by a law ordering it to do just that.
