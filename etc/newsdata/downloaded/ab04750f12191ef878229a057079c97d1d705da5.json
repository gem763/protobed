I grew up working in my dad\u2019s small business.\n\nI\u2019m a Latina with New Mexico roots over 15 generations deep on dad\u2019s side of the family and on my mother\u2019s side we\u2019re Zuni and Navajo. I\u2019m an enrolled member of the Navajo Nation and \u2026 I\u2019m a Republican.\n\nJIM BRESLO: TO HELP HOMELESS, CALIFORNIA TURNS TO DUMB IDEA LOVED BY THE LEFT \u2013 AND GUARANTEED TO FAIL\n\nMy life experience made me a Republican. Growing up I witnessed firsthand the poverty and destruction government policies had on my people and my peoples\u2019 land -- the Indian reservation.\n\nOverlapping, paternalistic federal and state programs, including fully funded and inefficient healthcare, dominate the reservations\u2019 economies. The restrictions the government places on land use, ownership and business development are microcosms of socialist failure in its purest form.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe government \u201chelp\u201d has never encouraged financial self-sufficiency. If anything, the programs have been a disincentive to economic freedom and prosperity.\n\nWhile I firmly believe all Americans should benefit from a safety net, I also know government handouts are never as powerful as a hand up. The federal government set up the reservations more than 100 years ago and, just like liberal democrats today, created these subsidized economies because they think they know what\u2019s best for us.\n\nThe result of more than 100 years of government assistance is Indian Reservations drowning in poverty. These well-intended programs have made our people the poorest Americans. Some reservations have unemployment rates close to 85 percent, and 29 percent of employed Native Americans nationwide live below the poverty level.\n\nAs a Native American woman, when I heard Sen. Elizabeth Warren speak of her heritage, I was intrigued. Then the tragic irony became apparent. Her policies proved she knew nothing about us.\n\nAs a Native American woman, when I heard Sen. Elizabeth Warren speak of her heritage, I was intrigued. Then the tragic irony became apparent. While she claimed to be one of us, her policies proved she knew nothing about us.\n\nShe\u2019s never experienced firsthand how big government programs fail our people. In fact, she now advocates those failed policies for all Americans.\n\nOver 10 years \"Medicare-for-All\" will cost $32 trillion. Green New Deal? $93 trillion. Her Green Manufacturing Deal; $2 trillion. In total about $127 trillion.\n\nEconomists say the new taxes she has proposed would generate only $3 trillion over 10 years. So where will she find the missing $124 trillion? Warren doesn\u2019t explain that it will require raising taxes on all Americans.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nTo improve peoples\u2019 lives we can\u2019t force them to rely on the government. Tax cuts and the free-market economy foster growth and opportunity, creating jobs and lifting the poor out of poverty.\n\nIs it a perfect system? No, but to see more families prosper and have better opportunities, free-market economic policies, especially tax cuts, are proven to work. Socialist government-controlled economies, with handouts and higher taxes, only lead to poverty and misery.\n\nToday, the U.S. unemployment rate is at its the lowest point in 50 years. The jobless rate for Hispanics hit a record low of 3.9 percent in September. African Americans maintained their lowest rate ever at 5.5 percent and adult women came in at 3.1 percent.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOur incredibly strong economy came about in no small part from President Trump\u2019s tax cuts and deregulation of business. We need to preserve the working families\u2019 tax cuts and expand them. That\u2019s what will help all of America\u2019s families and that is one of the biggest reasons I am considering running for U.S. Senate in New Mexico.\n\nI\u2019ve seen socialism, up close and personal.
