(AP) - Panthers quarterback Cam Newton said he plans on taking \u201ctime away from the game\u201d because of a mid-foot sprain that has bothered him since the third preseason game.\n\nNewton says in a 15-minute video blog released Friday night that he probably shouldn\u2019t have tried to play through the injury and needs to give himself time to heal.\n\n\u201cIt could very well be a week. Or two weeks. It could be three weeks, it could be four weeks, it could be six weeks,\u201d Newton said in the video in which he was smoking a cigar and drinking a glass of wine. \u201cBut I have to understand and know if it takes that time I trust in this team that they will, we will, still be in a great situation by the time I get back.\u201d\n\nKyle Allen has replaced Newton in the starting lineup and led Carolina to a 38-20 win over Arizona last Sunday. Allen will start against the Texans on Sunday.\n\nNewton says when he was warming up for the Sept. 8 season opener against the Rams his foot did not feel right.\n\nBut he decided to play anyway.\n\n\u201cI was hiding an injury where I could have easily said, \u2018You know what coach, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready. Maybe I need to kind of consider sitting this one out for the betterment\u201d of the team, Newton said. \u201c\u2026 Automatically, I thought, \u2018I\u2019ve got to play Week 1. I can\u2019t let my fans down. I\u2019ve got to be there for my team.\u2019\u201d\n\nNewton is the NFL\u2019s third-leading career rusher among quarterbacks, but has run the ball just five times for minus-2 yards in his first two starts.\n\nWith the Panthers facing a crucial fourth-and-1 at the Tampa Bay 2 in Week 2, coordinator Norv Turner called a play for Christian McCaffrey instead of Newton. McCaffrey was stopped short of the first down and immediately questions about Newton\u2019s foot arose.\n\nAfter the game coach Ron Rivera told reporters \u201cdon\u2019t worry about the foot.\u201d\n\nHowever, Newton hasn\u2019t practice since that 20-14 loss to the Bucs.\n\n\u201cEven if somebody is not close to you, you\u2019re trying to guard your foot,\u201d Newton said. \u201cI don\u2019t want nobody to touch it, I don\u2019t want nobody to sack me. So all these things are going on in my head in actual play. For so long I played this game one way, I played this game the only way I know how to play. And at this particular time, that No. 1 (his jersey number) that\u2019s out there, that hasn\u2019t been that same person.\u201d\n\nNewton said it \u201crejuvenated\u201d him when the Panthers shut him down in Week 3.\n\n\u201cIt takes the \u2018Superman\u2019 out of it,\u201d Newton said referring to nickname he has become known for. \u201cI really didn\u2019t want that mantra to be there. You feel like you\u2019re immortal. You feel you can\u2019t do no wrong. You feel like you\u2019re this big, bad guy but truth be told, I\u2019m human. Through this whole time, I\u2019m realizing this.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Panthers quarterback Cam Newton said he plans on taking \"time away from the game\" because of a mid-foot sprain that has bothered him since the third preseason game.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
