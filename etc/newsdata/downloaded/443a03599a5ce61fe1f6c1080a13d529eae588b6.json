The ordinances would have restricted military-style assault weapons like the AR-15 rifle authorities say was used in the attack. It also banned most uses of armor-piercing ammunition and high-capacity magazines, and allowed the temporary seizure of guns from people who are determined to be a danger to themselves or others.\n\nThe overwhelmingly Democratic council passed the legislation, and Peduto signed off. Council members who voted no called the legislation a waste of time and money, given the uncertainty over whether it would ever go into effect. Supporters said it was worth the effort.\n\nThe city \u201cexpended a large amount of energy\u201d arguing that its new laws did not run afoul of state law, the judge noted, but city officials \u201care not able to avoid the obvious intent of the Legislature\u201d to prevent municipalities from enforcing their own gun laws.\n\nPittsburgh tried enforcing an assault-weapons ban in 1993, but the state Legislature quickly took action to invalidate the measure, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that city officials had overstepped.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "A judge on Tuesday struck down gun restrictions that the Pittsburgh City Council imposed after last year's synagogue massacre.", "authors": ["Michael Rubinkam"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ap19300836681854.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
