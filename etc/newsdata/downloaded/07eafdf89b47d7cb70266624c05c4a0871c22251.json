The folding smartphone has undergone a minor metamorphose since its first, aborted launch - but it remains a surprisingly fragile piece of hardware that needs to be handled with extreme care.\n\nAccording to Samsung itself, keys, coins, water, credit cards and even fingernails have the potential to cause significant damage. Here's everything you're not allowed to do with the device.\n\nThe new version of the Samsung Galaxy Fold went on sale today in America for $US1980 with Australia expected to follow by the end of the year. It now comes with a sturdier hinge and tougher screen edges, but Samsung is still bundling the device with a bunch of warnings.\n\nAccording to US reviewers, here's the list of \"care instruction\" that appear on the very front of the phone when you open the box:\n\nDo not apply \"excessive pressure\" to the flexible screen or press with anything sharp, including fingernails. (Good thing you don't operate a phone with fingers.)\n\nKeep keys, coins, and cards away from the folded-up Fold, which has a slight gap between the two halves of its screen. (Good thing you never keep such items in pockets.)\n\nDo not expose the Fold to liquids or \"small particles\" that could enter through its exposed hinge. (Is pocket lint \"particles\"? Unclear.)\n\nKeep it away from credit cards, which it might demagnetise.\n\nWhile initially excited for the device - which has finally injected some excitement back into the stale smartphone market - we're beginning to think you might be better off waiting for the Fold 2. Hopefully we'll be able to bring you a proper review when it launches over here sometime before Christmas.
