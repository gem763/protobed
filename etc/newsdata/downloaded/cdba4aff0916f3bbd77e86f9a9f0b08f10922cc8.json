The Russian captain, who also hit the crossbar, delivered two second-half strikes, supplemented by a spectacular drive from Magomev Ozdoev and a late shot by Aleksandr Golovin.\n\nWell before kick-off it became known that Cyprus had achieved a 2-1 victory over Kazakhstan in Astana, a double reproach to the Scots, whose campaign began so badly with a 3-0 defeat at the same venue and who would go into this match four points behind the Cypriots \u2013 in third place and whom they meet away next month \u2013 a situation not foreseen when this campaign got under way in March.\n\nMoreover, the Scots looked ominously fragile in defence and well short of menace at the other end of the field. Liam Palmer, on his second appearance at this level, replaced Stephen O\u2019Donnell at right back and the Sheffield Wednesday man had for company Michael Devlin, whose league appearances for Aberdeen in the current campaign added up to a grand total of four.\n\nJohn Fleck was another debutant, taking his place in midfield between John McGinn and Callum McGregor. Ahead of that trio was Oliver Burke, whose flanking companions were Robert Snodgrass and Ryan Fraser.", "description": "Scotland\u2019s ruinous Euro 2020 qualifying campaign inflicted even more misery on the Tartan Army in Moscow as Russia posted a second victory over Steve Clarke\u2019s side, with Artem Dzyuba directing the wrecker\u2019s ball.", "authors": ["Roddy Forsyth", "Scottish Football Correspondent", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/10/TELEMMGLPICT000212642570-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqSEDG8gyBZhTudnE9IAx1spRvr8zCbYrvIq6b5Pz5H0I.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
