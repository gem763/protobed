Here's what it tastes like.\n\nAccording to a study by the University of Michigan, Beyond Meat production generates 90% less greenhouse gas emissions than beef production, and it requires 46% less energy.\n\nEliminating beef from the menu is just one step Lee is taking to achieve the company's \"planet over profit\" mission. Lee said that although the company's next focus is eliminating all single-use plastic by the end of 2021, it will continue to revise its menu offerings to be more sustainable.\n\nThe chain is also hitting the fast-growing keto trend by adding a new keto zoodle bowl featuring the Beyond meatball, also available starting Thursday.", "description": "Salad chain Just Salad is removing beef from its menu and adding plant-based Beyond meatballs instead.", "authors": ["Irene Jiang"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7821b72e22af1e4719434a-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
