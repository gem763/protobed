(Travis Golby/CBC)\n\nAll three adults were in stable condition by Sunday evening. The baby is expected to survive, but police said in a press release that they were not able to provide an update on the infant's medical status.\n\nEmergency responders from Winnipeg police, fire and paramedic crews were called to the Flora home, just west of Salter Street, at around 3:15 p.m.\n\nThe shooting took place just down the street from where neighbour Norbert McIvor lives.\n\n\"It's getting scary out there,\" he said.\n\nMcIvor has lived in the area for two years. He said the rising violence outside his door makes him think twice about leaving the house.\n\nNorbert McIvor said he worries for his family, including his wife, children and cousins who are living in the neighbourhood. (Travis Golby/CBC)\n\n\"I kiss my kids when I leave, just in case,\" McIvor said.\n\n\"I just hope everyone's safe out there. Be aware of your surroundings at all times. Even in your own home.\"\n\n'A stunning 18 hours'\n\nInvestigators have an idea of what may have led to the mid-day shooting, but Carver declined to comment.\n\n\"I think whenever there's a fairly brazen event like this in broad daylight where you've got firearms being used ... that's certainly an avenue we want to pursue,\" Carver said when asked if there were any gang relations.\n\nWinnipeg police Const. Rob Carver spoke to reporters late Sunday afternoon about the shooting that sent four people to hospital, after three homicides occurred in a period of 18 hours this weekend. (Travis Golby/CBC)\n\nCarver said police are seeing increasing levels of violence, adding that officers are regularly stopping people with edged weapons and pulling guns off streets almost daily.\n\n\"We're seeing more guns on the street, more violence, calls in general.\"\n\n\"It's probably a stunning 18 hours. Overnight we had three homicides,\" Carver said, including a 14-year-old who was stabbed and killed Saturday night at a Halloween party, which puts the city at 36 homicides so far in 2019.\n\n\"This is one of the busiest days certainly I've seen in my memory,\" Carver said.\n\nFlashing lights of police, fire and paramedics lit up Flora Avenue on Sunday afternoon. (Travis Golby/CBC)\n\n\"To have three homicides overnight is just about unheard of and now to have another shooting just hours after that, it's incredibly busy. We only have so many officers that we can pull in,\" he said.\n\nCarver said police resources are currently strained due to the volume of severe incidents. Police will continue to triage all calls for service and prioritize personal and public safety over property concerns and incidents where there is no immediate threat, reads a press release issued Sunday evening.\n\n\"It's all hands on deck at this point,\" Carver said.\n\nMajor crimes continues investigating the Flora shooting.", "description": "Winnipeg police said four people, including an infant, were shot at a house on Flora Avenue on Sunday afternoon.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5337499.1572212037!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/salter-and-flora.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
