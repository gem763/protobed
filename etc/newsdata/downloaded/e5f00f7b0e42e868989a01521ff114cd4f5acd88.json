(AP) \u2014 A Minnesota museum has turned its creepiest dolls loose just in time for Halloween.\n\nThe History Center of Olmsted County in Rochester has posted photos and videos of its miniature terrors on social media, taking votes for the most nightmarish one.\n\nCurator Dan Nowakowski told Minnesota Public Radio that for a lot of the dolls, the freakiness is all in the eyes. Some have movable eyelids that snap open when you lift the dolls up. The paint has chipped off the face of another contender, leaving it looking like a mummy.\n\nNowakowski says the dolls weren\u2019t intended to be frightening when they were made, but damage from play and the passage of time have turned them creepy.\n\nVoting continues through Thursday. The winner and runner-up will be displayed over Halloween.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Minnesota Public Radio News, http://www.mprnews.org\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Minnesota museum has turned its creepiest dolls loose just in time for Halloween.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2018/04/08/exchange_doll_collection_42973_c0-96-2200-1379_s1200x700.jpg?01aabb883854891dad0e339f47208870bbd7a8be", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
