We were not aware of his prior remarks that have surfaced over the past few days. The language he used is offensive, hurtful and unacceptable. We are sorry that we did not see these clips earlier, and that our vetting process was not up to our standard.\"\n\nFollowing news of his ouster, Gillis wrote on Twitter, \"I'm a comedian who was funny enough to get 'SNL.' That can't be taken away.\"\n\nHe added: \"Of course I wanted an opportunity to prove myself at 'SNL' but I understand it would be too much of a distraction. I respect the decision they made. I'm honestly grateful for the opportunity. I was always a Mad TV guy anyway.\"\n\nThe NBC sketch show had announced Gillis' hire last week, along with the additions of new series regulars Chloe Fineman and Bowen Yang, the only full-time cast member of East-Asian descent next season. News broke that afternoon of Gillis' history of making defamatory comments about Chinese Americans and homosexuals during episodes of his and fellow comedian Matt McCusker's \"Matt and Shane's Secret Podcast.\"", "description": "\"Saturday Night Live\" has fired one of its most recent hires, Shane Gillis, just days after videos of comedian making bigoted comments came to light.", "authors": ["Sandra Gonzalez", "Whitney Friedlander"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190912211548-shane-gillis-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
