One former adviser urged Trump to confront the crisis at hand and get past his fury over the probe of Russian election interference.\n\n\u201cI honestly believe this president has not gotten his pound of flesh yet from past grievances on the 2016 investigation,\u201d said Tom Bossert, Trump\u2019s former homeland security adviser. \u201cIf he continues to focus on that white whale,\u201d Bossert added, \u201cit\u2019s going to bring him down.\u201d\n\nThe Ukraine investigation produced what the Russian probe did not: formal House impeachment proceedings based on the president\u2019s own words and actions.\n\nThe White House last week released a rough transcript of Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as well as the whistleblower\u2019s complaint alleging the U.S. president pressured his counterpart to investigate the family of Joe Biden, the former vice president who is seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump\u2019s reelection next year.\n\nIn a series of tweets Sunday night, Trump said he deserved to meet \u201cmy accuser\u201d as well as whoever provided the whistleblower with what the president called \u201clargely incorrect\u201d information. He also accused Democrats of \u201cdoing great harm to our Country\u201d in an effort to destabilize the nation and the 2020 election.\n\n....In addition, I want to meet not only my accuser, who presented SECOND & THIRD HAND INFORMATION, but also the person who illegally gave this information, which was largely incorrect, to the \u201cWhistleblower.\u201d Was this person SPYING on the U.S. President? Big Consequences! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 29, 2019\n\nTrump has sought to implicate Biden and his son Hunter Biden in the kind of corruption that has long plagued Ukraine. Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration\u2019s diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either of the Bidens.\n\nThe House forged ahead, with Schiff\u2019s committee leading the investigation. Democrats are planning a rapid start to their push for impeachment, with hearings and depositions starting this week. Many Democrats are pushing for a vote on articles of impeachment before the end of the year, mindful of the looming 2020 elections.\n\nSchiff has said the whistleblower has agreed to testify, but the logistics involving security had yet to be set.\n\nOn a conference call Sunday, Pelosi, who was traveling in Texas, urged Democrats to proceed \u201cnot with negative attitudes towards him, but a positive attitude towards our responsibility,\u201d according to an aide on the call who requested anonymity to share the private conversation. She also urged the caucus to be \u201csomber\u201d and noted that polling on impeachment has changed \u201cdrastically.\u201d\n\nA one-day NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll conducted last Wednesday found that about half of Americans \u2014 49% \u2014 approve of the House formally starting an impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nThere remains a stark partisan divide on the issue, with 88% of Democrats approving and 93% of Republicans disapproving of the inquiry. But the findings suggest some movement in opinions on the issue. Earlier polls conducted throughout Trump\u2019s presidency have consistently found a majority saying he should not be impeached and removed from office.\n\nOn the call, Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries of New York urged the caucus to talk about impeachment by repeating the words \u201cbetrayal, abuse of power, national security.\u201d At the same time, Democrats\u2019 campaign arm was mobilizing to support the candidates, according to a person on the call who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the details.\n\nIn contrast, Republicans offered a televised array of strategies to a president who spent the day at his golf club in Virginia and prefers to handle his own communications.\n\nStephen Miller, the president\u2019s senior policy adviser, called the whole inquiry a \u201cpartisan hit job\u201d orchestrated by \u201ca deep state operative\u201d who is also \u201ca saboteur.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president of the United States is the whistleblower,\u201d Miller said.\n\nAnd House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said Trump had done nothing impeachable.\n\n\u201cWhy would we move forward with impeachment? There\u2019s not something that you have to defend here,\u201d the California Republican said.\n\nTrump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, promoted a debunked conspiracy theory, insisting that Ukraine had spread disinformation during the 2016 election.\n\nBossert advised that Trump drop that defense.\n\n\u201cI am deeply frustrated with what he and the legal team is doing and repeating that debunked theory to the president. It sticks in his mind when he hears it over and over again,\u201d said Bossert, who also was an adviser to President George W. Bush. \u201cThat conspiracy theory has got to go, they have to stop with that, it cannot continue to be repeated.\u201d\n\nGiuliani not only repeated it but also brandished what he said were affidavits that support them and claimed that Trump \u201cwas framed by the Democrats.\u201d\n\nHe also at one point said he would not cooperate with Schiff, but then acknowledged he would do what Trump tells him. The White House did not provide an official response on whether the president would allow Giuliani to cooperate.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re going to obstruct,\u201d Schiff warned, \u201cthen they\u2019re going to increase the likelihood that Congress may feel it necessary to move forward with an article on obstruction.\u201d\n\nTwo advisers to the Biden campaign sent a letter Sunday urging major news networks to stop booking Giuliani on their shows, accusing Trump\u2019s personal attorney of spreading \u201cfalse, debunked conspiracy theories\u201d on behalf of the president. The letter added: \u201cBy giving him your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation.\u201d\n\nBiden advisers Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield sent the letter to the presidents of ABC News, NBC News, CBS News, MSNBC, CNN and Fox News as well as executive producers and anchors of their news shows. The advisers also asked that if Giuliani continues to appear, the networks give equivalent time to a Biden campaign surrogate and admonished the networks for giving Giuliani time in the first place, calling it \u201ca disservice to your audience and a disservice to journalism.\u201d\n\nGiuliani appeared on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d and CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d while Schiff was interviewed on ABC and NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Bossert spoke on ABC and Miller on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d McCarthy\u2019s remarks were broadcast Sunday on CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\n\nMarketWatch added to this report.", "description": "House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Sunday that he expects the whistleblower at the heart of impeachment proceedings against President...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ717_19trum_ZG_20190904201152.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
