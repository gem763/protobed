At the same time, The New York Times and The New Yorker are trying to drive Brett Kavanaugh off the court with still more unsupported, second- or third-hand allegations. The spectacle is positively Orwellian.\n\nThe next Supreme Court appointment, assuming Trump gets one, will be pivotal; we can\u2019t afford for him to waste it by choosing a justice whom he thinks will be \u201ceasier to confirm,\u201d despite his or her weaknesses.\n\nTrump should recognize that no conservative appointment will be \u201ceasy.\u201d The left has already shown us their playbook. It reads: treat as \u201cliterally Hitler\u201d any jurist who might return to an honest reading of the Constitution on Second Amendment rights, abortion, or executive authority on immigration.\n\nPresident Trump should not take the salacious nature of the smear campaign against Brett Kavanaugh to mean that he must appoint a woman. Why believe that leftists are incapable of crafting an obscene smear of either sex? Put nothing past these people. Nothing.\n\nMore importantly, if we let the attacks on Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh become precedent, it would mean that Republicans could never again nominate a man. That\u2019s obviously silly, severely restricting our choices among an already narrow conservative bench.\n\nThere will be no easy appointments; Trump should make it count.\n\nTrump\u2019s presumptive choice is Judge Amy Coney Barrett, currently sitting on the Seventh Circuit. But I have profound questions about Barrett\u2019s suitability for the high court, as Barrett\u2019s apparent unwillingness to separate her faith from her legal judgment should worry conservatives; jurists\u2019 first allegiance should be to the Constitution, not the shifting political and doctrinal line at Pope Francis\u2019 Vatican.\n\nTHE NEXUS OF FAITH AND JURISPRUDENCE\n\nAs a convinced and apostolic Catholic, I\u2019m cheered by the fact that Barrett is a pious member of my Church. I am confident that her sentiments are profoundly pro-life, but I find myself troubled by Barrett\u2019s public statements on the nexus of her jurisprudence and her faith.\n\nJustice Scalia, a devout Catholic and convinced pro-lifer, famously said that if he\u2019d found abortion rights in the Constitution, he\u2019d have ruled to uphold them\u2014and favored an amendment to change it.\n\nSpecifically, Barrett fails to draw the bright line separating her legal judgment and practice from her faith, as Justices Alito and Thomas do. Like Justice Scalia, these men are firm originalists, who interpret the Constitution in light of the original public meaning of its text\u2014regardless of their personal or religious preferences. Justice Scalia, a devout Catholic and convinced pro-lifer, famously said that if he\u2019d found abortion rights in the Constitution, he\u2019d have ruled to uphold them\u2014and favored an amendment to change it. That\u2019s the proper attitude for a jurist in a constitutional republic, who knows that he\u2019s neither a prelate nor a philosopher king.\n\nWhy then should conservatives, even Catholics, be concerned about a justice letting his or her faith influence his or her jurisprudence? The answer is simple: Pope Francis sits on the throne.\n\nFrancis has used his position to promote a wide array of leftist political and theological stances that conflict with his predecessors\u2019 teachings. These include capital punishment, which goes back to the Covenant of Noah in scripture, and was on the books of the Vatican City state into the late 1960s. Francis has recently unilaterally declared capital punishment forever \u201cinadmissible,\u201d whatever that means. In fact, Francis has gone further and claimed that life imprisonment is also evil.\n\nStill more urgent is immigration. On this subject, Francis defies the Church\u2019s own Catechism, which clearly states that the common good of receiving countries must be weighed against the desires of newcomers to better their lives, and that immigrants must obey immigration laws, or lose their right to enter. Instead, Francis routinely denounces every effort to enforce any democratically enacted immigration law. His appointees have literally demonized politicians such as Matteo Salvini, comparing him to the \u201cAntichrist\u201d for his stance opposing the mass influx of Muslims into Europe.\n\nSome Catholics have rightly defied Francis, noting that he has no authority to change long-settled teachings, or impose specific politics on Catholics. But too many pious Catholics seem conflicted, and feel obliged to adapt their long-held beliefs to suit the current inhabitant of the Vatican\u2014as if he were some kind of oracle. This \u201cCatholic Stalinism,\u201d if you will, recalls the attitude depicted in Arthur Koestler\u2019s Darkness At Noon: for the good Stalinist, the \u201cvoice of history\u201d is the Communist Party in Moscow, and the current Party Line is what they must believe.\n\nBARRETT\u2019S HIGHER POWER: CONSTITUTIONAL LAW OR DIVINE LAW?\n\nIs Amy Coney Barrett this kind of Catholic? Or is she a more independently minded, Constitutionally scrupulous Catholic, in the mold of Justice Scalia? We need to ask that question, in light of her own writing. Barrett co-authored a scholarly legal article with John H. Garvey, now the President of the Catholic University of America. They stated their conclusion quite bluntly:\n\n[W]e believe that Catholic judges (if they are faithful to the teaching of their church) are morally precluded from enforcing the death penalty. This means that they can neither themselves sentence criminals to death nor enforce jury recommendations of death.\n\nCatholics differ on this issue for theological reasons, but what matters is what Barrett believes. A full ten years before Pope Francis made clear that he considers all (not most) capital punishment \u201cinadmissible,\u201d Barrett was anticipating the change in Catholic teaching, and binding herself to it. Why? She cites a document of the Second Vatican Council:\n\nBishops, teaching in communion with the Roman Pontiff, are to be respected by all as witnesses to divine and Catholic truth. In matters of faith and morals, the bishops speak in the name of Christ and the faithful are to accept their teaching and adhere to it with a religious assent of soul.\n\nIf Barrett and Garvey were correct about the obligations of Catholic judges, then no Catholic who agrees with them should be appointed to any court, or confirmed by the Senate if appointed. It is the duty of a judge to implement the U.S. Constitution, not the teachings of the Catholic Church\u2014or, worse, the political preferences of a pope who has decided unilaterally to change those teachings.\n\nWhat answer do Barrett and Garvey offer to the dilemma of a Catholic judge who is unwilling to enforce the clear dictates of the U.S. Constitution on capital punishment? To avoid \u201cformal cooperation with evil,\u201d she must recuse herself from ruling:\n\nThe moral impossibility of enforcing capital punishment in the first two or three cases (sentencing, enforcing jury recommendations, affirming) is a sufficient reason for recusal under federal law. (p. 306)\n\nThe answer gets more emphatic further down:\n\n[T]he principle at stake in capital sentencing is a moral one, not a factual or simply legal one. And the judge is asked to violate it\u2014not to reason from different legal premises to morally unobjectionable conclusions (like Justice Brandeis did in Whitney). There is no way the judge can do his job and obey his conscience. The judge\u2019s conscience tells him to impose a life sentence; federal law directs him to impose death. Because the judge is unable to give the government the judgment to which it is entitled under the law, \u00a7 455(b)(1) directs him to disqualify himself. (p. 334)\n\nIt is clear what Judge Barrett believes about the obligations of a Catholic judge when there is a direct conflict between her views of what the Church teaches and the U.S. Constitution dictates: they must recuse themselves.\n\nThat\u2019s a scary prospect, if Judge Barrett is to become Justice Barrett.\n\nFAITH OVER TEXTUALISM\n\nLeftist judicial scholar Mark Tushnet has argued that Barrett could not vote to overturn Roe v. Wade without raising the question of whether she has let her religious opinions unduly color her reading of the Constitution. As he wrote at Vox:\n\nAn orthodox Catholic judge\u2019s views about material cooperation with evil might therefore play no role in his or her decision. The difficulty, though, is that someone observing the judge\u2019s action\u2014the reasonable person whose inferences matter when the \u201cappearance of impartiality\u201d standard is applied\u2014can\u2019t tell the difference between a decision to overrule Roe because the decision was not firmly rooted in the relevant purely legal materials, and a decision to do so because any other course would amount to material cooperation with evil, from the judge\u2019s perspective.\n\nTushnet is right. Given Barrett\u2019s view that one\u2019s Catholic convictions should govern, and prevent a judge from following the letter of the U.S. Constitution on capital punishment, it would be impossible to discern what motivated her decision. If Roe came before a future court, Barrett should probably recuse herself. I don\u2019t rule it out that she might in fact do so. By her own logic, she\u2019d be right. That\u2019s because no one with a view of the law like Barrett\u2019s belongs on any federal court, let alone the Supreme Court.\n\nIt is the duty of a judge to implement the U.S. Constitution, not the teachings of the Catholic Church\u2014or, worse, the political preferences of a pope who has decided unilaterally to change those teachings.\n\nAssuming Barrett is intellectually consistent, the impact of her undue deference to Church authority would extend to other issues, especially the crucial subject of immigration. In her article, Barrett cites as authoritative not the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which is still (for the moment) sane on the subject. (Pope Francis could change it at any time to demand absolute open borders, and Barrett would apparently feel bound by that.)\n\nNo, she cites a single papal encyclical by Pope John Paul II, and \u201cclear and forceful denunciations\u201d of capital punishment by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. If those authorities are to bind Catholic jurists, then on immigration their import is clear. Virtually every effort by the Trump administration to enforce U.S. law regulating immigration has been denounced by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which faces financial boycotts from laymen over sex abuse, and derives much of its income from federal non-profit contracts, mostly to serve immigrants. Pope Francis has spoken clearly and forcefully against virtually all immigration restrictions, anywhere. On his visit to the U.S. he specifically condemned then-candidate Trump\u2019s campaign to build a wall on the southern border.\n\nIf an immigration case came before the Supreme Court, would a Justice Barrett feel compelled by her Catholic conscience to follow the pope and his bishops? Would she recuse herself, depriving us of a crucial vote on a subject of enormous national importance? Would her scrupulous and idiosyncratic view of the vast deference Catholics owe the pope on political issues, ironically, lead to the ongoing influx of immigrants who overwhelmingly vote for pro-choice candidates?\n\nIf an immigration case came before the Supreme Court, would a Justice Barrett feel compelled by her Catholic conscience to follow the pope and his bishops?\n\nWhat if Barrett distinguishes between \u201clife or death\u201d issues such as capital punishment, and what Catholics traditionally called \u201cprudential\u201d issues such as immigration, where laymen are free to differ from bishops and the pope? The problem is that the barrier between such kinds of issues has collapsed under Pope Francis.\n\nAs recently as the reign of John Paul II, then-Cardinal Ratzinger listed capital punishment as such a prudential issue. Pope Francis has determined to extend papal sway over much, much more. Further, leading Catholics are pretending that immigration, poverty programs, health care, and nearly every other policy affecting human life, is equally a \u201clife issue.\u201d Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago responded to the exposure of Planned Parenthood\u2019s profiting from the sale of fetal lungs and eyes by equating that crime with the outcomes of conservative policies on the Second Amendment, immigration, and welfare programs:\n\nWhile commerce in the remains of defenseless children is particularly repulsive, we should be no less appalled by the indifference toward the thousands of people who die daily for lack of decent medical care; who are denied rights by a broken immigration system and by racism; who suffer in hunger, joblessness and want; who pay the price of violence in gun-saturated neighborhoods; or who are executed by the state in the name of justice.\n\nCupich followed here the doctrinal program of his predecessor, leftist Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, which is called in Catholic circles the \u201cSeamless Garment\u201d of \u201clife issues.\u201d Barrett cited the Seamless Garment favorably, as a source for her rejection of capital punishment. Would she agree with Pope Francis, Cardinal Cupich, and the U.S. Council of Catholic Bishops, that immigration is a \u201clife issue\u201d where she is bound to obey the Vatican or recuse herself?\n\nI don\u2019t know the answer. But if President Trump makes the mistake of nominating Judge Barrett for the U.S. Supreme Court, I hope Republican senators are willing to demand answers from her. If she does not renounce the weirdly theocratic version of a Catholic judge\u2019s constitutional obligations that she has offered, she deserves rejection by the Senate.\n\nAs a Catholic who has been active in the pro-life movement since 1975, that\u2019s how I\u2019d vote.", "description": "Her writings on faith and jurisprudence should worry conservatives.", "authors": ["John Zmirak", "Written By"], "top_image": "https://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Amy_Coney_Barrett-1000x563.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
