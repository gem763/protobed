Millennials are old pros at this, with their infamous list of confirmed kills including everything from napkins to marriage. After a long, unchecked killing spree, however, the latest trend in millennial rebellion is really more of an anti-rebellion. Unlike older generations who rebelled against their elders by indulging in whatever reckless behaviors constituted the sex, drugs and rock and roll of the day, more young people are breaking with tradition by embracing sobriety.\n\nMuch has been made of the changing attitudes towards alcohol among younger generations in recent months, from Amanda Mull\u2019s frank, if disputed, assertion that \u201cmillennials are sick of drinking\u201d in the Atlantic to Sarah Gaynes Levey\u2019s investigation into millennials\u2019 waning interest in Alcoholics Anonymous for Cosmopolitan.\n\nJust because fewer millennials are going to AA however, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not interested in sobriety. In fact, it\u2019s quite the opposite. More people, especially those that count themselves among generations Y and Z, are exploring alcohol-free lifestyles in what\u2019s come to be known as the \u201csober curious\u201d movement \u2014 a term popularized by Ruby Warrington in her 2018 book, Sober Curious.\n\nUnlike traditional conceptions of sobriety associated with programs like AA, sober curious individuals aren\u2019t necessarily recovering from a history of substance abuse or swearing off alcohol entirely. Rather, the sober curious movement has attracted a diverse range of individuals whose past and current relationships with alcohol vary considerably.\n\n\u201cSober curious applies to people who have an interest or curiosity about sobriety,\u201d says MJ Gottlieb, founder of Loosid, a dating and social app designed to unite the digital sober community through events, travel and networking with like-minded individuals.\n\nAccording to Gottlieb, the growing interest in the sober curious community is less of a trend than an awakening. \u201cIt\u2019s an awakening that people want to be healthier,\u201d he tells InsideHook. \u201cIt\u2019s also an awakening that you don\u2019t have to drink to face life\u2019s ups and downs. Sobriety makes you face life\u2019s challenges with vulnerability and pain and with that pain comes the ability to deal with future life events infinitely better.\u201d\n\nWhile Gottlieb notes that not all sober curious individuals are necessarily seeking full sobriety or recovery from alcohol abuse, he adds that the community can help some realize \u201cthey actually have alcohol or substance abuse issues and need to explore possible recovery options.\u201d\n\nOne anonymous Loosid user tells InsideHook that while he didn\u2019t initially see himself pursuing sobriety long-term, his experiences within the sober curious community have changed his mind. \u201cI\u2019ve attended some Loosid events and am now beginning to realize I may actually need to stay sober,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s actually weird to hear me say it, but it\u2019s more exciting. I feel I\u2019m speaking to people who are being more authentic with me.\u201d\n\nNot all sober curious individuals practice sobriety long-term or cold turkey, however, and the wide range of alcohol consumption practices represented in the community reflects a subversion of a traditional binary approach that has long dominated conceptions of sobriety among past generations.\n\nThe sober curious community gives people the space to explore sobriety on a spectrum, not as the binary that has long forced individuals to identify either as a drinker or a non-drinker\n\n\u201cWhile this is by no means a hard-and-fast rule, I do think that sometimes older generations see drinking as very black and white \u2014 either you do it every day or you don\u2019t do it at all \u2014 and that if you don\u2019t do it at all, it\u2019s because you\u2019ve had an issue with it in the past,\u201d says Regina Dellea, co-founder of Getaway, an alcohol-free bar in Brooklyn. \u201cI think younger generations are a little more flexible in their relationship with drinking alcohol, and many are okay with it being something they do on occasion but not necessarily as a habit.\u201d\n\nYounger generations may be at the forefront of this cultural shift \u2014 and, according to Gottlieb, \u201care becoming sober at an alarmingly higher rate than people in other age demographics\u201d \u2014 but they aren\u2019t the only ones engaging in the sober curious community. While Getaway\u2019s customer base tends to skew younger, Dellea notes that the bar also sees \u201ca lot of people who have been sober for decades who come in and say they wish we had been around earlier.\u201d\n\n\u201cYounger and older people alike are getting sober curious,\u201d adds Gottlieb, who attributes some of the momentum to the success of the growing wellness movement. \u201cIt gives the individual an opportunity to explore the benefits of sobriety, whether it be better health or increased productivity.\u201d\n\nLike many dominant movements across a variety of ideological fields today, sober curiosity breaks with tradition by prioritizing fluidity. The sober curious community gives people the space to explore sobriety on a spectrum, not as the binary that has long forced individuals to identify either as a drinker or a non-drinker, and to simultaneously assume the stigma and stereotypes that have often plagued either identity.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the \u201cmovement\u201d is actually much less of a movement than it is an individual journey free of restrictive rules or enforced mentalities. \u201cI just know that I\u2019m enjoying it,\u201d says the anonymous Loosid user. \u201cIt\u2019s a break from the norm.\u201d", "description": "More Millennials and Gen.
