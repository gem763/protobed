The goal is to stop child pornographers, terrorists and foreign adversaries looking to disrupt U.S. institutions.\n\nAttorney General William Barr and acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan planned to make the request Friday in a letter they and officials in Australia and the U.K. are sending to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nBarr and his counterparts say they support strong encryption, as well as promises made by tech companies to protect users\u2019 data. But they wrote that, \u201cWe must find a way to balance the need to secure data with public safety and the need for law enforcement to access the information they need to safeguard the public, investigate crimes, and prevent future criminal activity.\u201d\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg.

Only the sender and recipient have the special key needed to unlock and read them.\n\nUsers of Facebook Messenger can also opt into encryption to keep the content secret.\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow @edbaig on Twitter\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2019/10/04/facebook-encryption-why-bill-barr-wants-backdoor-access-messages/3858584002/", "description": "Attorney General William Barr wrote to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg seeking Justice Department backdoor access to encrypted messages on WhatsApp.", "authors": ["Edward C.
