Shanghai was down 0.7 per cent.\n\n\"Markets have been swayed by the president's remarks every day... In the latest move, sentiment got a boost from the president's positive remarks\" on trade, said Makoto Sengoku, market analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute.\n\n\"It eased worries for now that the spat would weigh on the global economy,\" he told AFP.\n\nElsewhere, crude prices were little changed from Wednesday's decline after an unexpected rise in US inventory and a swift recovery in Saudi Arabia's output following the September 14 attacks on its oil infrastructure. Brent was flat and WTI was up 0.1 per cent.\n\nOn forex markets, the pound was little changed. The British currency had pulled back after it rallied on Tuesday on the belief that the odds of a no-deal Brexit had fallen.\n\n\"With the political outlook ahead of Brexit murkier than ever and an election seemingly inevitable, any good news is well and truly baked into GBP now,\" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda.\n\n\"It will probably take a Brexit agreement signed and sealed to give it new upside momentum.\"\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Stocks - [HONG KONG] Asian markets rose on Thursday following upbeat comments from US President Donald Trump that a trade deal with China could come sooner than expected and steps towards a new agreement with Japan. .
