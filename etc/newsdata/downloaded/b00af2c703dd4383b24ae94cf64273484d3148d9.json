The issue is not one of the media wanting to be above the law, it's that there are way too many laws, many of which are absurd, and the net effect is that even the most basic information is inaccessible let alone important stuff that people ought to know.\n\nThe advertisements launched this week as part of the campaign are not aimed at engendering sympathy for journalists, it's about informing the public about the crushing culture of secrecy in which they live. Journalists just happen to be at the coal face of trying to find out stuff and tell the people.\n\nFor example, the campaign asks people to imagine you are at that awful stage in life where you have to find an aged care home for a parent.\n\nLast year in Australia, there were more than 4000 reported assaults in aged care homes but the government, via the Department of Health, hides behind \"privacy\" laws that enable it to refuse to reveal in which homes the offences are occurring and whether they are perpetrated by staff or residents.\n\nThere are scores and scores of other examples where information is secret just for the sake of it and that's before you enter the realm of national security, an area that has had layer upon layer of special powers added since the September 11, 2001 terrors.\n\nThe laws have helped keep Australia safe but they have also been abused to cover up information that should be readily available. And they have resulted in journalists being subject to criminal penalties for trying to find stuff out or being in receipt of leaked information.\n\nMoreover, decades of needless secrecy have enshrined a culture of absurdity the permeates every level and every crevice of the public service. Departments have huge media units festooned with people on six figure salaries who are paid to obfuscate.\n\nDuring the election campaign, on the day the Treasurer was to release the budget update in accordance with the charter of budget honesty, this publication rang the Treasury media unit to ask what time the document would be released so plans could be made regarding coverage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe poor frightened individual who answered the phone said he was unauthorised to even confirm whether the document was going to be released that day, even though that was already known, let alone what time. He asked the request be sent via email.\n\nAnnoyed and angry, we just rang the then-Treasury secretary on his mobile.\n\n\"About 2 o'clock mate,\" he said.\n\nThere is little sympathy from most politicians who, as it happens, are above the law in that they have unique access to parliamentary privilege and, when they don't like laws, the ability to change them.\n\nBarnaby Joyce whose career came to an end when the Daily Telegraph published paparazzi pictures of his pregnant mistress crossing a road - for which the journalist was given a Walkley Award which is judged by peers - said press freedom cuts both ways.\n\nThe idea is to is to inform the public about what they are not being told, not expect them to feel sorry for journos.", "description": "There are scores and scores of other examples where information is secret just for the sake of it and that's before you enter the realm of national security.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1902%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/18d68e5f2bb3d54caff090f8bb8a9c5a58b6d3d9", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
