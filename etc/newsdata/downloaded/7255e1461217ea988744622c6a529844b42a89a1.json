It was clear that police did not want the bridge blocked by protestors and so they were vetting everyone that was walking on to the bridge.\n\n\u2018Most of the XR people were heading towards Millbank, so it was only non-XR people going about their daily business.\n\n\u2018The woman in the foreground seemed put out that the police officer was asking where she was going.\n\nAlex Armitage, who uploaded the video, alleged that police were \u2018vetting everyone walking onto the bridge\u2019 (Picture: @alexjarmitage/Twitter)\n\n\u2018He wasn\u2019t satisfied with her explanation that she was going to work and asked her to produce her work ID, which she did.\n\n\u2018The atmosphere felt really tense and intimidating.\u2019\n\nAnother person who allegedly got asked for ID claimed the Met Police told him \u2018they could stop & search anyone they suspect was intending to cause disruption and check ID\u2019.\n\nWhen he asked if he could refuse, the officer allegedly replied saying: \u2018Yes, if you\u2019re not going on the bridge\u2019.\n\nThe allegations spurred outrage online, with hundreds of people claiming the Met had no right to ask for ID.\n\nJames Lazarus wrote: \u2018They have no right to stop people or demand their ID.\n\n\u2018Unlawful authoritarian behaviour from the police.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJo Owen added: \u2018Christ. Checking for what exactly? Deeply sinister.\u2019\n\nUK police have the right to stop and ask a person\u2019s name, what they are doing in the area and where they are going.\n\nHowever, members of the public do not have to stop and answer any questions.\n\nIf they don\u2019t and there is no other reason to suspect the person, this alone cannot be used as a reason to search or arrest them.\n\nLabour\u2019s Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott told Metro.co.uk that if police were requesting ID in the alleged circumstances, it was \u2018an infringement of civil liberties\u2019.\n\nShe said: \u2018In this country we have a long tradition of policing by consent.\n\n\u2018We do not have a police force or other state agencies who can demand to see people\u2019s ID on a blanket basis.\n\n\u2018Many people don\u2019t carry ID and it is an infringement of everyone\u2019s civil liberties to demand them in this way.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s even worse when this is done to clamp down on peaceful protests, and it should not be normalised.\u2019\n\nRacist yobs throw bleach and make monkey noises at woman in drive-by attack\n\nA spokesperson from the Met Police told Metro.co.uk: \u2018The MPS is aware of footage showing officers stopping and speaking to people crossing Lambeth Bridge on Tuesday, 15 October.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Officers are fully aware one of the tactics and objectives of Extinction Rebellion is to block the bridges in central London.\n\n\u2018Officers do not hold the power to force members of the public to identify themselves in these circumstances, and have not been briefed to do so.\n\n\u2018However, officers on Lambeth Bridge have been proactively engaging with individuals crossing to ensure those with an intention of bringing London to a standstill are not successful in doing so.\n\n\u2018In some instances, members of the public identified themselves to officers.\n\n\u2018The MPS has not received any complaints in relation to the conduct of officers on Lambeth Bridge.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
