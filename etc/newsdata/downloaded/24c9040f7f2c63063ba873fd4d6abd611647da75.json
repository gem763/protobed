And that\u2019s what happened.\n\nThe threat of Typhoon Hagibis forced Rugby World Cup organizers in Japan to cancel two pool games scheduled for Saturday, including the Pool B match between the defending champion All Blacks and Italy in Toyota.\n\nThat ended New Zealand\u2019s perfect record in the group stage.\n\nThe three-time champions had won all 31 of their pool games dating back to the first tournament in 1987. New Zealand had also won 17 straight games at the World Cup, playoffs included, before Thursday\u2019s announcement by organizers.\n\nWorld Rugby said Hagibis, which has the same force as a Category 5 hurricane, \u201cis highly likely to cause considerable disruption in the Tokyo, Yokohama and Toyota City areas throughout Saturday.\u201d\n\nThe England-France Pool C game in Yokohama was also canceled. The typhoon is predicted to be the worst of Japan\u2019s 2019 typhoon season and other games on Sunday might also be affected.\n\nJapan\u2019s World Cup had no contingencies for group games that couldn\u2019t be played on the day they were scheduled. No provision for a postponement and no chance of being played at another venue. The rules mean the game is called a scoreless draw and both teams get two log points. It\u2019s the first time any Rugby World Cup games have been cancelled.\n\nThe All Blacks will get over it.\n\nAfter all, they still finish top of Pool B, as expected. New Zealand still has the playoffs and an attempt at a third straight World Cup title and fourth overall ahead of it.\n\nCoach Steve Hansen had no issues with the game being called off for safety reasons.\n\n\u201cWhen you get a typhoon to the level we\u2019re getting, then safety is the paramount thing so it\u2019s a no-brainer,\u201d Hansen said.\n\nThe cancellation hit Italy harder.\n\nItaly had a sliver of a chance of going through to the quarterfinals if it beat the defending champion for the first time in its history. No one was expecting that, though, and it wasn\u2019t forefront in Italian players\u2019 minds in Toyota.\n\nInstead, Italy was ready to give veterans Sergio Parisse and Leonardo Ghiraldini fitting farewells after their long service to the team.\n\nNo. 8 Parisse, Italy\u2019s captain, has played 142 tests, breaking the record for a northern hemisphere player in the Azzurri\u2019s last game at the World Cup against South Africa. He is the second most-capped player ever behind New Zealand World Cup winner Richie McCaw. The 34-year-old Parisse said he was going to retire after the World Cup and was due to go out against the world\u2019s best team in Toyota.\n\nAt least he got to play at this World Cup.\n\nHooker Ghiraldini, who is also 34, had to struggle to recover from injury to make Italy\u2019s squad and was due to be given his first action in Japan against New Zealand. It was to be in recognition of his 13 years and more than 100 tests of commitment in the front row.\n\nGhiraldini reportedly shed tears among his teammates at the Italy camp when news broke that the game against New Zealand had been canceled.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "At times it felt like only a force of nature could stop New Zealand's streak of wins at the Rugby World Cup.
