It\u2019s an homage to the past with hope for the future. Steeped in the harsh reality of the streets while being markedly optimistic, it\u2019s the rag-to-riches tale of the hustle \u2013 and that\u2019s why it rises to the top of the rap canon. BBC Music polled music journalists, critics, artists and industry experts, and the results are in. The greatest hip-hop song of all time, in their opinion, is Juicy by The Notorious B.I.G., aka Biggie Smalls.\n\nThe 1994 release is a watershed moment in the timeline of hip-hop, marking the official arrival of Biggie Smalls (born Christopher Wallace). Juicy is a modern bildungsroman of a young, black man growing up in Brooklyn. \u201cIt was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! Magazine,\u201d he recalls about his life. \u201cI made the change from a common thief/To up close and personal with Robin Leach.\u201d\n\nTapping into his natural storytelling ability, Biggie vividly shares the story of the struggle, of being broke and overlooked. \u201cBorn sinner, the opposite of a winner/Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner?\u201d he asks. Sure, he\u2019s flexing his braggadocio, but there\u2019s also touching vulnerability amid the machismo. \u201cGirls used to diss me/Now they write letters \u2019cause they miss me,\u201d he admits. \u201cStereotypes of a black male misunderstood/And it's still all good.\u201d\n\nJuicy was heralded as a classic pretty much out of the gate, and it catapulted the 22-year-old into the upper echelons of rap. A self-fulfilling prophecy: a new rap king in the East was crowned\n\nThat rise \u2013 from when \u201cbirthdays was the worst days\u201d to champagne-sipping glory \u2013 is the quintessential rap Cinderella tale. In that vein, Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs served as Biggie\u2019s sonic steward and godfather. Diddy (or Pete Rock, depending on which version of the story you believe) tapped into a winning formula of flipping classic \u201980s samples for the succulent beat. Mtume\u2019s No 1 R&B hit Juicy Fruit adds an addictive melody and gives Biggie\u2019s hard rhymes an upbeat, feel-good vibe.\n\nJuicy is synonymous with hip-hop\u2019s ambitious ethos. It\u2019s become such a staple that every hip-hop head is expected to know the first verse by heart \u2013 at least. Biggie\u2019s life and career were cut tragically short in 1997. However, Diddy helped bolster the mythology of Juicy with the next generation by making it a key plot device on 2002\u2019s reality show Making The Band. Contestants were made to recite the song\u2019s bars out loud in order to prove their musical chops.\n\nThere\u2019s a universality in Juicy that enables it to stand the test of time, whether you grew up in the belly of Brooklyn\u2019s Bed-Stuy neighbourhood, or you experience your own daily struggle. Twenty-five years later, Biggie\u2019s uplifting message of perseverance, of better days, still resonates. We don\u2019t have him around anymore, but the aspiration he left behind continues to inspire. And it\u2019s all good.\n\nMore on BBC Music\u2019s greatest hip-hop songs of all time:\n\nThe 25 greatest hip-hop songs of all time\n\nWhat critics had to say about the top 10\n\nFull list of critics who participated \u2013 and how they voted\n\nTrends and surprises in the poll (not available in UK)\n\nWhy are there so few women in hip-hop polls?\n\nPlaylist of the top 25 songs (Spotify)\n\nHow many of the songs in the poll do you agree with?
