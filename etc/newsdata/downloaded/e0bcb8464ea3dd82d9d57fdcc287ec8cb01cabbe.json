Yet that very fact is what drew that killer to us with a weapon of war he should have never been able to buy.\"\n\nBeto O'Rourke tells @TomLlamasABC that \"as helpful and important as background checks and red flag laws and ending the sale of weapons of war\" are, they are \"not enough\" if there are millions of AR-15s and AK-47s out on the streets https://t.co/T37EaVOvlU #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/aBckID6Qp1 \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 13, 2019\n\n\"We're a nation of laws and I fully believe in this country in my fellow Americans,\" he continued. \"Gun owners and non-gun owners alike, Republicans, independents, and Democrats.

Many of them said, I would willingly give that weapon up, I don't need it.\"\n\nHe then added: \"I think that's the way forward is make sure that we ask every American to do the right thing.

I just think it's a terrific opportunity, these debates, for each one of us on that stage to be able to talk with the American people about who we are, and if you give us the chance, where we want to lead this country. All I hope for is that I was as clear as I could be.\"\n\n\"I got out there and talked about what I believe in,\" Elizabeth Warren tells ABC News when asked if she was able to distinguish herself from other candidates at the debate https://t.co/T37EaVOvlU #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/IjaYdacojg \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 13, 2019\n\n11:37 p.m.: Klobuchar pitches herself as a candidate who can unite a unique Democratic coalition, says it's too early to say she hasn't 'caught on'\n\nSen.

In particular our most vulnerable. A large part of my career as a courtroom prosecutor was handling cases that affected crimes against women and children,\" Harris said.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Kamala Harris tells ABC News when asked if she's proud of her work as a prosecutor, adding that she became a prosecutor \"because I just have a very strong and natural desire to want to protect people and in particular, our most vulnerable\" https://t.co/T37EaVOvlU pic.twitter.com/SvV5Lzmlnu \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 13, 2019\n\n\"There's an incredible amount of support there.

It's not something about personality. It's about the health care policy. That was my focus,\" he added.\n\n11:11 p.m.: Buttigieg takes aim at liberals Warren, Sanders from the spin room\n\nSouth Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg went after his Democratic rivals, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, as he pitched his vision for the country.\n\n\"No question that my vision is different,\" he said. \"It's not just about what's attainable, it's about what the right policy is. I view it differently from Senators Sanders and Warren who think we can throw the switch on this big part of the American economy. With health care, I think it's better to trust Americans to make that decision for themselves.\"\n\n\"It's not perfect but we take every step that we can to lift one another up and that's what we gotta do nationally, as well,\" Pete Buttigieg tells ABC News when asked about his own challenges unifying his city as mayor https://t.co/T37EaVOvlU #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/TSUOtq6a5Q \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 13, 2019\n\nHe also tackled the question of electability, when asked by ABC News' Senior Washington reporter, Devin Dwyer, \"Electability is one of the main reasons I think people should support me. Every time Democrats have won, not just in my lifetime -- we're going to get out there and campaign are. The best way to demonstrate you're electable is to win. That's what we're seeking to do in the early states. Think about this. Every single time, the democratic party has won not just in my lifetime, the last 50 years, it's been with somebody who came from outside Washington. Somebody who represented a new generation in a different set of ideas. By contrast, every time we've tried the safe choice.\"\n\n11:07 p.m.: Booker says debate went 'really, really well'\n\nSen. Cory Booker told ABC News Chief National Affairs Correspondent Tom Llamas in the spin room that Thursday's debate put on display the differences in the Democratic field, but also demonstrated his ability to unify the party.\n\n\"I think this was yet another opportunity for me to not only show my ideas, but also the spirit of our party. That stage and all the differences that people were trying to make amongst democrats, to me that's important and our differences matter,\" Booker said. \"But what matters a lot more is who can unify our party and the disparate voices so we can beat Donald Trump. Even more importantly than that, who can help unify this country that has suffered, really, under a president that's demeaning and degrading and dividing people. So I think I got a chance to show my ability to pull people together,\" he added.\n\n\"Our differences matter but what matters a lot more is who can unify our party and the disparate voices so we can beat Donald Trump,\" Cory Booker tells ABC News following #DemDebate https://t.co/T37EaVOvlU pic.twitter.com/k5gwkGVgJS \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 13, 2019\n\n11:03 p.m.: Stepping off the debate stage, Sanders touts his performance in the spin room\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders reiterated the differences that divide him from the primary's polling frontrunner, Joe Biden.\n\n\"I hope so,\" he said when asked if he made a clear difference between him and former Vice President Biden. \"Joe and I have a very different vision for this country. Joe is a good friend of mine. I like him very much. He's a very decent human being. But Joe and I have a very different voting record and a very different vision for this country.\"\n\n\"You can ask Senator Warren that...all I can focus on is my campaign,\" Bernie Sanders tells @ABC when asked why Elizabeth Warren's supporters should back him.\n\n\n\n\"I took on the whole bloody establishment ... we changed the political conversation in America\" https://t.co/T37EaVOvlU pic.twitter.com/5ysyvCzeCh \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 13, 2019\n\nIn the post-debate interview, when pressed on if there is room in the field for both him and Warren, Sanders said, \"You can ask Senator Warren that. I\u2019m sure she has a good answer. All I can focus on is my campaign. I have been there. Four years ago, I made a decision that I did not want democratic primary to simply be a primary in which the needs of working people were not represented. And I got into that primary. I took on the whole bloody establishment.\"\n\n10:45 p.m. The debate has ended\n\nThe candidates are all smiles and Andrew Yang even blew a kiss as they left the stage.\n\n10:42 p.m.: Klobuchar, Castro highlight family history in closing question\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar highlighted her struggles with her father's alcoholism as the catalyst for leading her into public service.\n\n\"My challenges and resilience have brought me up here,\" she said. \"I grew up with a dad who struggled with alcoholism his whole life and after his third DWI, he had a choice between jail and treatment. He chose treatment...And that made me interested in public service, because I feel like everyone should have that same right, to be pursued by grace.\"\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro talked about growing up in a single-parent household to talk about his resiliency, \"I shouldn't be here on this stage. You know, Castro is my mother's name and was my grandmother's name before her. I grew up in a single-parent household on the west side of San Antonio, going to the public schools.\"\n\nHe added: \"There's nobody that gets tested more in a position of public trust than the president of the United States. This president has failed that test. But I want you to know that if you elect me president, I won't.\"\n\n10:40 p.m.: Booker reflects on his political legacy, O'Rourke invokes El Paso's resiliency\n\nReflecting on resiliency, Sen. Cory Booker and former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke shared the stories of the communities that they call home.\n\n\"My biggest professional setback is embarrassing, because a lot of folks know about it. I, with a bunch of tenant leaders in Newark, New Jersey, in 2002 took on the political machine, and boy did they fight back,\" Booker said.\n\n\"The lesson I learned of resilience is to trust people because the power of the people is always greater than the people in power. And the test of America right now is not a referendum on Donald Trump, it's a referendum on us and who we are and who we're going to be together,\" Booker said.\n\nO'Rourke told the story of a soccer coach who was shot in El Paso last month, and his desire to continue to do his job, and spoke to the city's ability to come together in the face of tragedy.\n\n\"Everything that I've learned about resilience I've learned from my hometown of El Paso, Texas. In the face of this act of terror that was directed at our community, in large part by the president of the United States, that killed 22 people and injured many more, we were not defeated by that, nor were we defined by that,\" O'Rourke said.\n\n10:36 p.m.: Yang highlights his struggles with entrepreneurship\n\n\"I was an unhappy lawyer for five whole months and I left to start a business,\" Andrew Yang began. \"My company flopped. I lost investors, hundreds of thousands of dollars, still owed 100,000 in school debt. My parents still told people I was a lawyer.\" But he said he persisted: \"I kept working in small growth companies for another ten years and eventually had some success. After I had some success, I still remembered how hard it was.\"\n\nYang pointed to one of his guests in the audience, Shawn Wynn, a young entrepreneurs who was supported by Yang's nonprofit, Venture for America.

What happened was that when I trusted voters to judge me based on the job that I did for them, they decided to trust me and re-elected me with 80% of the vote,\" he added.\n\n10:29 p.m.: Warren, Sanders and Harris show resiliency through their personal backgrounds\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, taking the final question on personal resiliency, said, \"I've known what I wanted to be since second grade. I wanted to be a public school teacher...By the time I graduated from high school, my family didn't have money for a college application, much less to send me off to four years at a university...I made it as a special needs teacher.\"\n\nShe continued: \"Here's resilience. I said, I'll go to law school. I practiced law for about 45 minutes and then went back to my first love, which is teaching...the reason I'm standing here today is because I got back up, I fought back. \"\n\nFrederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders talked about his upbringing in a rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York, and his unlikely political rise to the U.S. Senate.\n\n\"Resilience, to me, means growing up in a rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York, the son of an immigrant who came to this country without a nickel in his pocket. Professional resilience means to me, George, running for U.S. Senate in Vermont and getting 1% of the vote,\" Sanders said in response to ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos' question.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris answered by ticking through her many uphill battles on her way to becoming a U.S. Senator: \"I was the only black elected -- woman black elected attorney general in the state, in the country. And each time, people would say, it's not your time, it's not your turn, it's going to be too difficult, they're not ready for you, and I didn't listen.\"\n\n10:25 p.m.: Biden interrupted by protests in the debate hall\n\nFormer Vice President Biden was interrupted by protesters during an answer on what the most significant professional setback he's faced was.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what the protesters were shouting.\n\n\"My dad had an expression.

Cory Booker invoked his mayoral tenure, saying, \"People are talking about raising teacher salary. We actually did it in Newark, New Jersey.\"\n\n\"We didn't stop there,\" he said. \"We closed poor-performing charter schools, but we expanded high-performer charter schools. We were a city that said, we need to find local solutions that work for our community.\"\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro: \"It is a myth that charter schools are better than public schools. They're not.\" https://t.co/T37EaVOvlU #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/mSeVOvJQaC \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 13, 2019\n\n10:15 p.m.: Biden pressed on his record on race relations\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden was pressed by ABC News' National Correspondent Linsey Davis on his record on race relations, which he defended vigorously.\n\n\"Look, there's institutional segregation in this country. And from the time I got involved, I started dealing with that. Red lining, banks, making sure we are in a position where -- look, you talk about education. I propose that what we take is those very poor schools, the Title I schools, triple the amount of money we spend from $15 to $45 billion a year,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden also used his time to answer a previously asked question about Venezuela.\n\n\"I'm going to go like the rest of them do, twice over. Okay? Because here's the deal. The deal is that we've got this a little backwards. By the way, in Venezuela, we should be allowing people to come here from Venezuela. I know Maduro.

And let's be clear in all the ways we talk about this, money for public schools should stay in public schools. Not go anywhere else. I've already made my commitment.\"\n\n\"We will have a secretary of education who has been a public school teacher,\" she insisted.\n\n10:08 p.m.: Buttigieg goes after Education Secretary Betsy DeVos as he advocates for paying teachers more\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg, garnering loud cheers from the crowd, went after President Trump's Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.\n\n\"Step one is appoint a Secretary of Education who actually believes in public education. I believe in public education. And in order to strengthen it, some things are very complex, for preparing for a future where knowledge is at your fingertips, but we got to teach more to do with critical thinking and social and emotional learning,\" Buttigieg said.\n\n\"If we want to get the results that we expect for our churn, we have to support and compensate the teaching profession. Respect teachers the way we do soldiers and pay them more the way we do doctors,\" he argued.\n\n10:06 p.m.: Yang defends his support for charter schools\n\nAndrew Yang, one of the most vocal proponents for charter schools, said on his support, \"I am pro-good school. I've got a kid, one of my little boys just started public school last week, and I was not there because I was running for president.\n\nHe then paused for a second, before adding, \"We need to pay teachers more, because the data clearly shows that a good teacher is worth his or her weight in gold.\"\n\n\"The answer is to put money directly into the families and neighborhoods to give our kids chance to learn and our teachers a chance to teach,\" he concluded.\n\n10:12 p.m.: Harris touts her plan for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)\n\nSen. Harris, a graduate of Howard University, touted her plan to invest more in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) like Texas Southern University.\n\n\"I also want to talk about where we are here at TSU, and what it means in terms of HBCUs. I have -- as part of my proposal, that we will put $2 trillion into investing in our HBCUs for teachers, because -- because -- because, one, as a proud graduate of a historically black college and university, I will say -- I will say that it is our HBCUs that disproportionately produce teachers and those who serve in these positions,\" Harris said.\n\n10:05 p.m.: Warren again casts corporate America as the culprit for lack of action on climate change, Harris calls out Republicans on the issue\n\nThe discussion on climate change continued with Senators Warren on Harris, who each cast the issue as one of the utmost importance.\n\n\"We need to work on every front on climate change. It is the threat to every living thing on this planet and we are running out of time,\" Warren said.\n\nHarris went after congressional Republicans over the issue, saying that their inaction shows a \"lack of courage.\"\n\n\"When I've been in the United States Senate for now the last two and a half years and I look at our counterparts, the Republicans in the United States Senate, they must be looking at their children and then when they look at the mirror, I don't know what they see, but it's a lack of courage,\" Harris said.\n\n10:02 p.m.: Klobuchar pitches a Midwesterner's approach to climate change\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar leaned into her Midwestern roots to outline her approach to tackling the climate crisis, \"I think having someone leading the ticket from the midwest will allow us to talk about this in a different way and get it done.\" She continued: \"On day one, I will get us back into the international climate change agreement.

Bernie Sanders called out former Vice President Joe Biden's 'yes' vote on the Iraq war in 2003 - when he was a senator from Delaware.\n\n\"The big differences between you and me, I never believed what Cheney and Bush said about Iraq and I voted against the war in Iraq and help lead the opposition,\" Sanders said. \"I think also I am the only person up here to have voted against all three of trump's military budgets.\"\n\n9:49 p.m.: Biden defends his record on Iraq, Afghanistan\n\nFormer Vice President Biden, who has taken criticism recently for his record on foreign policy, and his vote in favor of the Iraq War, defended his record, and said he was wrong to say he opposed the war immediately after it started.\n\n\"With regard to Iraq, the fact of the matter is that, you know, I should have never voted to give bush the authority to go in and do what he did,\" Biden said.\n\n\"I said something that was not meant the way I said it. I said, from that point on. What I was arguing against in the beginning, once he started to put the troops in, was that in fact we were doing it the wrong way, there was no plan,\" Biden said.\n\nHe later leaned on the trust President Obama put in him to ensure an effective end to U.S. involvement in Iraq.\n\n\"And it was later when we came into office, that Barack - the president - turned to me, he said, Joe, we have a plan to get out. He turned, he said, Joe will organize this, get the troops home..\"\n\n9:46 p.m.: Buttigieg, only military veteran on stage, advocates against 'endless wars'\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a U.S. Navy veteran and the only candidate on stage Thursday with military experience, advocated for a drawdown of the War in Afghanistan.\n\n\"If there's one thing we've learned about Afghanistan, from Afghanistan, it\u2019s that the best way not to be caught up in endless war is to avoid starting one in the first place. And so when I am president, an authorization for the use of military force will have a built in three-year sunset,\" Buttigieg said.\n\n\"By the way, we also have a president right now who seems to treat troops as props, or worse, tools for his own enrichment,\" he added, taking a swipe at Trump.\n\n9:44 p.m.: Warren takes up the issue of bringing troops home\n\nWhen asked by \"World News Tonight\" Anchor and Managing Editor David Muir about keeping her promise to bring troops home starting now, without a deal with the Taliban, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren responded, \"What we're doing right now in Afghanistan is not helping the safety and security of the United States, it is not helping the safety and security of the world, it is not helping the safety and security of Afghanistan.\"\n\n\"We need to bring our troops home,\" she said. \"Then we need to make a big shift. We can not ask our military to keep solving problems that cannot be solved militarily.\"\n\nDuring a follow up, Warren invoked her trip to Afghanistan with the late Sen. John McCain, to elevate her foreign policy credentials.\n\n\"I was in Afghanistan with John McCain two years ago this past summer,\" she said. \"We talked to military leaders, American and local leaders, we talked to people on the ground and asked the question...Show me what winning looks like...no one can describe it. And the reason no one can describe it is because the problems in Afghanistan are not problems that can be solved by a military.\"\n\n9:42 p.m.: Booker gives a shoutout to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and his hair\n\nHitting President Trump over his aggressive trade policies, including slapping tariffs on Canadian goods, Booker gave a shoutout to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\n\"You literally have him using a national security waiver to put tariffs on Canada. I'm the only person on this stage that finds Trudeau's hair very menacing, but they are not a national security threat,\" the famously bald Booker said.\n\n\"We cannot go up against China alone. This is a president that has a better relationship with dictators like Duterte and Putin than he does with Merkel and Macron,\" Booker said, invoking President Trump's foreign policy strategy, which Democrats charge is too cozy with authoritarian regimes.\n\n9:40 p.m.: Moderate Biden finds common ground with liberal warren\n\nIn a rare moment of comity, former Vice President Joe Biden said he agreed with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Amid the debate on trade, he said, \"I think Elizabeth -- Senator Warren is correct, at the table has to be labor, and at the table have to be environmentalists. The fact of the matter is, China, the problem isn't the trade deficit, the problem is they're stealing our intellectual property.\"\n\n9:36 p.m.: Harris navigates the debate on trade\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris, who was asked how her trade policy would differ than former President Obama's, said, \"When we look at this issue, my trade policy, under a Harris administration, is always going to be about saying, we need to export American products, not American jobs. And to do that, we have to have a meaningful trade policy. I'm not a protectionist Democrat. Look, we need to sell our stuff. And that means we need to sell it to people overseas.\"\n\nMike Blake/Reuters\n\nAs she has done several times throughout the debate, Harris then hit at President Trump, asserting in jest, \"But the bottom line is this, Donald Trump in office on trade policy, you know, he reminds me of that guy in \"The Wizard of Oz,\" you know, when you pull back the curtain, it's a really small dude?\"\n\n9:31 p.m.: Klobuchar says Trump is treating farmers and workers like 'poker chips'\n\nAs she directed her criticism at President Trump, the frequent target of attacks Thursday night, Minnesota Amy Klobuchar said, \"What [Trump] has done here, has assessed these tariffs on our allies, he's put us in the middle of the trade war and treating our farmers and workers like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos.\"\n\n9:31 p.m.: Klobuchar says Trump is treating farmers and workers like 'poker chips'\n\nAs she directed her criticism at President Trump, the frequent target of attacks Thursday night, Minnesota Amy Klobuchar said, \"What [Trump] has done here, has assessed these tariffs on our allies, he's put us in the middle of the trade war and treating our farmers and workers like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos.\"\n\n9:29 p.m.: Yang, Buttigieg criticize Trump's trade strategy with China\n\nBoth Yang and Buttigieg criticized President Trump's strategy in dealing with China, and the South Bend Mayor calling him an \"empty chair\" on the global stage.\n\n\"We have to let the Chinese know that we recognize that President Trump has pursued an arbitrary and haphazard trade policy that has had victims on both sides,\" Yang said.\n\n\"Well, the president clearly has no strategy.

We didn't separate families.\"\n\nYou didn't answer the question,\" Ramos said.\n\n\"Well, I did answer the question,\" Biden responded.\n\n\"Did you make a mistake with those deportations,\" Ramos posed.\n\n\"The president did the best thing that was able to be done,\" Biden said.\n\nRamos replied, \"How about you?\"\n\nBiden said: \"I'm the vice president of the United States.\"\n\n9:07 p.m. Fact-checking Democratic candidates on the issues at the ABC News debate in Houston\n\nABC News is fact checking the Democratic Debate in Houston between Sen.

But this is -- what I'm sorry about, I'm sorry that it had to take issues coming to my neighborhood or personally affecting Beto to suddenly make us demand change,\" Booker said.\n\nDavid J. Phillip/AP\n\n\"We have had more people die due to gun violence in my lifetime than every single war in this country combined from the revolutionary war until now. This is not a side issue to me.

The way that I think about this is, I've seen more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you. I have attended more police officer funerals than I care to tell you. I have hugged more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you,\" Harris said.\n\nShe also praised Congressman O'Rourke's response to the mass shooting last month in El Paso, Texas.\n\n\"Beto, god love you for standing so courageously in the midst of that tragedy. You know, people asked me in El Paso, they said, you know, because I have a long-standing record on this issue,\" Harris said.\n\n8:54 p.m.: Gun control takes center stage at the third Democratic debate, with El Paso survivors in the audience\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden says that since Sandy Hook, gun control \"went from a cause to a movement.\"\n\nHe then praised former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke for his response to the El Paso shooting:\n\n\"By the way Beto -- forgive me for saying Beto,\" Biden said.\n\nO'Rourke responded: \"That\u2019s okay. Beto's good.\"\n\nBiden continued: \"The way he handled what happened in his hometown is meaningful.

This is the problem.\"\n\n8:49 p.m.: Klobuchar defends her record as a prosecutor in Minnesota\n\nWhen Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar was pressed on her eight-year tenure as a prosecutor in Minnesota, in which dozens of incidents where black men were killed by police, she responded, \"That's not my record ... when I was there, the way we handled these police shootings, I actually took a stand to make sure outside investigators handled them.\"\n\nShe added: \"I will make sure we don't just do the First Step Act when it comes to criminal sentencing, that we move to the Second Step Act.\"\n\n8:47 p.m.: Conversation turns to criminal justice reform, and Harris' prosecutorial record comes under scrutiny\n\nThe conversation around racism then turned towards criminal justice reform, and Sen. Kamala Harris' record as a prosecutor came under direct scrutiny, a record she defended.\n\n\"I'm glad you asked me this question, and there have been many distortions of my record. Let me be very clear. I made a decision to become a prosecutor for two reasons. One, I've always wanted to protect people and keep them safe and second, I was born knowing about how this criminal justice system in America has worked in a way that has been informed by racial bias,\" Harris said.\n\n\"My plan is about making sure that in America's criminal justice system, we de-incarcerate women and children, that we end solitary confinement and that we work on keeping families intact. And as President of the United States, knowing the system from the inside, I will have the ability to be an effective leader and get this job complete,\" Harris added.\n\n8:45 p.m.: Buttigieg talks up his 'Douglass Plan'\n\nAs he followed suit with his democratic rivals, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg addressed the system racism in the country, saying, it \"preceded this president and even when we defeat him, it will be with us.\"\n\n\"That's why we need a systemic approach to dismantle it,\" he continued. \"It's -- it's not enough to just take a racist policy, replace it with a neutral one and expect things will just get better on their own ... This time, a Douglass plan that we invest right here at home. To make sure that we're not only dealing with things like the over-incarceration of black Americans.\"\n\n8:43 p.m.: Booker pitches a new path forward to attack 'systemic racism'\n\nBooker, fielding a question from ABC News' Linsey Davis, said a comprehensive criminal justice plan is central to combatting \"systemic racism,' in America.\n\n\"Racism exists, the question isn't who isn't a racist, it's who is and isn't doing something about racism,\" Booker said.\n\n\"It's nice to go back to slavery, but we have a criminal justice system that is so racially biased, we have more African-Americans under criminal supervision today than all the slaves in 1850. We have to come at this issue attacking systemic racism, having the courage to call it out and having a plan to do something about it,\" he added.\n\n8:41 p.m.: O'Rourke tackles racism in America standing on the stage of HBCU Texas Southern University\n\nWhen asked about addressing the racial divide in the country, former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke said, \"Racism in America is endemic. It is foundational...I'm going to follow Sheila Jackson Lee's lead and sign a reparations bill that will allow us to address this at its foundation. But we will also call out the fact that we have a white supremacist in the white house and he poses a mortal threat to people of color all across this country.\"\n\nBeto O'Rourke: \"Racism in America is endemic. It is foundational. We can mark the creation of this country not at the 4th of July, 1776, but August 20, 1619, when the first kidnapped African was brought to this country against his will.\"https://t.co/BOc41aqICy\ufffd#DemDebate pic.twitter.com/4kwZLxUqbt \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 13, 2019\n\nThe other Texan on stage, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro chimed in, first praising O'Rourke for his response to the El Paso shooting, and then arguing, \"We need to root out racism and I believe we can do that, because that doesn't represent the vast majority of Americans who do have a good heart. They need a leader to match that and I will be a president that matches that.\"\n\n8:38 p.m.: Outsider Yang injects his business background in health care debate\n\nAmid a tense moment between some of his fellow contenders, Andrew Yang said, \"We know we're on the same team here. We know we're on the same team. We all have a better vision for health care than our current president.\"\n\nHe then continued: \"I believe we're talking about this the wrong way. As someone who has run a business, I know that our current health care system makings it harder to hire people, makes it harder to give them benefits and treat them as full-time employees. It's harder to change jobs. It's certainly harder to start a business. The pitch we have to make to the American people is, we will get the health care weight off of your backs and then unleash the hopes and dreams of the American people.\"\n\n8:36 p.m.: Castro goes directly after Biden, Buttigieg, Klobuchar tries to be the voices of reason\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and Biden had a particularly contentious exchange, also over healthcare, with Castro accusing Biden of forgetting the details of his own healthcare plan.\n\n\"Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago? I can't believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in, and now you're saying they don't have to buy in. You're forgetting that,\" Castro said to gasps from the audience.\n\n\"I said anyone like your grandmother who has no money,\" Biden said in defense.\n\n\"This is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable. This reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington. Scoring points against each other. Poking at each other,\" Buttigieg said.\n\n\"A house divided cannot stand. And that is not how we're going to win this,\" Klobuchar said.\n\n8:35 p.m.: Texas native O'Rourke argues some Democrats are offering a 'false choice'\n\nFormer Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke spoke directly to his fellow Democrats to tell them, \"we've got to do better.\" \"I also think we're being offered a false choice between those who propose an all or nothing gambit, forcing tens of millions off of insurance that they like, that works for them, to force them onto medicare and others who want to, as the vice president does, incrementally improve what we have, which will leave many, maybe millions uncared for,\" he said. \"We've got to do better.\"\n\n8:33 p.m.: Biden invokes Sanders 'socialist' label\n\n\"If you notice, nobody's yet said how much it's going to cost the taxpayer. I hear this, large savings, the president -- my friend from Vermont thinks that the employer is going to give back if you negotiate as a union all these years, got a cut in wages because you got insurance. They're going to give back that money to the employee?\" Biden asked Sanders.\n\n\"As a matter of fact, they will,\" Sanders responded.\n\n\"Well let me tell you something.

So let's talk about the fact that Donald Trump came into office and spent almost the entire first year of his term trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\n8:29 p.m.: Buttigieg says he 'trusts the American people' on healthcare, Sanders hits back\n\nButtigieg also went after Medicare for All, and pitched his own plan that he dubs \"Medicare for All who want it.\"\n\n\"The problem, Senator Sanders, with the damn bill that you wrote, and that Senator Warren backs, is that it doesn't trust the American people. I trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you. Not my way or the highway,\" Buttigieg said.\n\nSanders doubled down on his plan, Medicare for All, \"Medicare for All is comprehensive health care. Covers all basic needs, including home health care. It allows you to go to any doctor you want, which many private insurance company programs do not.\"\n\n8:27 p.m.: Amy Klobuchar seeks to carve out her path on health care by taking aim at Sanders\n\n\"Senator Sanders and I have worked valiantly to bring down the cost of pharmaceuticals,\" said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. \"And while Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill. And on page eight -- on page eight of the bill, it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it.\"\n\n\"That means that 149 million Americans will no longer be able to have their current insurance. That's in four years. I don't think that's a bold,\" she added.\"\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar: \"I may not be the loudest person up here, but I think we've already got that in the White House.

I've met people who like their doctors, I met people who like their nurses, I've met people who like their pharmacists, I met people who like their physical therapists. What they want is access to health care,\" Warren said.\n\n\"Let us be clear, Joe, in the United States of America, we have spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians or any other major country on Earth,\" Sanders argued.\n\n8:23 p.m.: Biden keeps up the fight for Obamacare by taking aim at the progressive tag team\n\n\"This is about candor, honesty,\" the former vice president said. \"The tax of 2% that the Senator [Warren] is talking about, that raises about $3 billion. Guess what? That leaves you $28 billion short. The senator said before, it's going to cost you in your -- there will be a deductible - in your paycheck. You\u2019re gonna -- The middle class person, someone making 60 grand with three kids, they're going to end up paying $5,000 more.\"\n\n8:21 p.m.: Sanders forcefully defends Medicare for All after Biden's criticism\n\nSanders immediately defended his Medicare for All plan, and went after Biden for pushing for \"the status quo.\" \"Joe said that Medicare for All would cost over $30 trillion. That's right, Joe, status quo over ten years will be $50 trillion!\" Sanders said.\n\n\"We need -- we need a health care system that guarantees health care to all people as every other major country does, not a system which provides $100 billion a year in profit for the drug companies and the insurance companies. I'll tell you how absurd the system is tonight on ABC, the health care industry will be advertising, telling you how bad medicare for all is, because they want to protect their profits. That is absurd,\" Sanders said.\n\n8:20 p.m.: Warren fields question on middle class taxes going up for health care\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren hedged when directly asked on if middle class taxes will go up under \"Medicare for All\" \"How do we pay for it? We pay for it, those at the very top, the richest individuals and the biggest corporations, are going to pay more. And middle class families are going to pay less,\" she said. \"That's how this is going to work.\" When pressed again, she responded, \"The answer is Medicare for All, costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations. But for hard-working families across this country, costs are going to go down and that's how it should work under medicare for all in our health care system.\"\n\n8:19 p.m.: Biden pushed back on Warren and Sanders' health care plans\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden kicked off the debate and pushed back on the health care plan being pitched by Warren and Sanders, Medicare for All.\n\n\"I think we should have a debate on health care. I think -- I know that [Senator Warren] says she's for Bernie, well, I'm for Barack. I think it worked,\" Biden said.\n\n\"So as far, my distinguished friend, the senator on my left has not indicated how she pays for it and the senator has,\" Biden said gesturing to Sanders and Warren. \"In fact, come forward and said how he's going to pay for it, but it gets him halfway there.\"\n\nSen.

The second is how insufficient our politics is to meet the threat that we have right now.\"\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker struck a unifying tone in his opening statement: \"That's the story of America. At our best, we unify, we find common cause and common purpose. The differences amongst us Democrats on the stage are not as great as the urgency for us to unite as a party, not just to beat Donald Trump, but to unite America in common cause and common purpose,\" Booker said.\n\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg harkened back to the 18th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, saying he wants to focus on the future of the country: \"We just marked the anniversary of 9/11.

But if they prove uncooperative, Biden would take the fight directly to the American people and name check those in the GOP when he does, the advisers said.\n\nBiden's team downplayed the suggestion that his recent missteps on the trail were having an impact, and repeated their belief that voters know who he is, and that they will watch him on the trail and make their own determination on whether his age is an issue.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest mistake we can make in the campaign would be to not let Joe Biden be Joe Biden. People love that he speaks candidly, they know that sometimes he's going to misstate a date or a name or a location. But that's not you know--they also know that they're getting the real deal from him, when they hear from him,\u201d a senior advisor said.\n\nABC News' Mary Bruce and Molly Nagle contributed to this report.\n\n5:29 p.m. Sen.

We\u2019re too good \u2026 Mr. President, this is America. And we are stronger and great because of this diversity, Mr. President, not in spite of it.\"\n\n\"Our problems didn't start with Donald Trump,\" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren told the crowd at the same debate one night prior, as she articulated her theme of striving for bold reforms. \"Donald Trump is part of a corrupt, rigged system ... We're not going to solve the urgent problems that we face with small ideas and spinelessness. We're going to solve them by being the Democratic party of big structural change.\"\n\nFor the first time, the lineup includes polling front-runner Biden sandwiched in between Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, pitting \"Middle Class Joe\" against the leading progressives.\n\nHeidi Gutman/Walt Disney Television\n\nBut as the former vice president relies on winning back the voters that propelled the first African-American president, Barack Obama, to the White House, liberals Sanders and Warren are running a different kind of race, seeking to forge their own coalition to capture the party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\nMuch like in 2008, the 2020 contest could see a state-by-state battle for the nomination -- with each caucus and primary bringing a different front-runner and resetting the path to victory.\n\nThe divisions in the candidates' strategies were made clear at the second debates in Detroit, when several Democrats took aim at Obama's presidency -- both directly and indirectly -- and the very legacy Biden is running to extend.\n\nRehashing the Obama legacy\n\nDespite the former president being the party's most popular member, the more liberal flanks and some lower-polling candidates forced Biden to fend off the attacks on his former boss, particularly on health care and immigration.\n\n\"Right now we have a dysfunctional health care system. Eighty-seven million uninsured or underinsured, 500,000 Americans every year going bankrupt because of medical bills, 30,000 people dying while the health care industry makes tens of billions of dollars in profit,\" said Sanders, who along with Warren spent a large portion of their time vigorously defending Medicare for All.\n\n\"Medicare for All will fix that and that's why I'll fight for it,\" said Warren about the legislation introduced by Sanders and seen by some as a more comprehensive replacement for Obama\u2019s signature piece of legislation, the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"The reality is that our plan will bring health care to all Americans under a Medicare for All system,\" said California Sen. Kamala Harris, defending her plan which is more of a hybrid health insurance system that allows private companies to be able to offer health insurance plans within the Medicare system for consumers. \"Your plan by contrast leaves out almost 10 million Americans,\" she said of the Sanders.\n\nOn immigration, although the previous White House took steps to overhaul the immigration system -- even using executive powers to protect Dreamers -- several 2020 Democrats took aim at the three million deportations under the Obama presidency, leaving Biden as the sole navigator of those criticisms.\n\nAt one point, Booker interrupted the elder statesman: \"You invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign. You can't do it when it's convenient and then dodge it when it's not.\"\n\nMeg Kinnard/AP\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, too, challenged Biden over Obama-era immigration policies on that stage, without using Obama\u2019s name.\n\n\"Mr. Vice President, it looks like one of us has learned the lessons of the past and one of us hasn't,\" said Castro, who served under Obama. \"My immigration plan would also fix the broken legal immigration system because we do have a problem with that.\"\n\nBiden responded by calling out his fellow Democrats for unleashing friendly fire against Obama instead of railing against Trump.\n\n\"To compare him to Donald Trump, I think is absolutely bizarre,\" Biden said at one point during the July debate.\n\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg echoed Biden\u2019s sentiment to reporters in Las Vegas days after the debate, saying, \"[I\u2019m] a little puzzled that when we're all running against President Trump, some folks felt the need to run against President Obama.\"\n\nEven the president saw the last debate as more of a disavowing of Obama than of himself.\n\nAt a rally in Cincinnati following the second round of debates, Trump called out his Democratic rivals for unleashing on his predecessor, telling the crowd, \"The Democrats spent more time attacking Barack Obama than they did attacking me practically.\"\n\nThose who took aim at parts of Obama's record -- either by backing Medicare for All over Obamacare or by rejecting certain aspects of his immigration agenda -- might run into a tougher road ahead as they seek to win back those voters who drifted from Democrats and turned to Trump.\n\nFinding a lane in a still crowded primary\n\nAt this next debate, the contenders outside of the top tier -- standing on the edge of the stage and in need of a breakthrough -- will likely be trained on finding their lane by giving Democratic primary voters more than just a return to the pre-Trump era (like what Warren and Sanders are pitching), without alienating moderates or disapproving of the Obama legacy (which Biden is campaigning on).\n\nFor some in the field hoping to pick up voters that might stray from the 76-year old Biden, that middle ground oftentimes reflects a message of \"generational change,\" \"unity\" and rising above the divisiveness.\n\nButtigieg, who touts a refrain fueled with urgency, said over the weekend in New Hampshire, \"None of us can afford to wait to act on our current problems, because they're becoming a crisis \u2026 It's not enough to think up a good policy. We have to unify Americans around these solutions or nothing will actually get done.\"\n\n\"The purpose of the presidency is not the glorification of the president, but the unification of the people,\" he added.\n\nHarris invokes her prosecutorial past and compelling backstory to appeal to a broad coalition -- often telling voters as she did in the last debate, \"I come from fighters ... My sister Maya and I joke we grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults that marched about this thing called 'justice.' And I'm prepared to march with you, to fight with you for the best of who we are, and to successfully prosecute the case against four more years of Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m going to make sure the American people know about my strong, compelling vision for the future of our country. I believe that I can bring our country together, that we can reunite the old Obama coalition and then take that to the next level,\" Castro, who frequently pushes for a fairer system to even the playing field, said in Beaufort, South Carolina last month.\n\nBooker, who is looking to assemble support by inspiring his audience, told the New Hampshire Democratic Party state convention over the weekend: \"Beating Donald Trump is the floor it is not the ceiling. Beating Donald Trump gets out of the valley, but it does not get us to the mountaintop. I want to go to the mountaintop.\"\n\nFormer Texas Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, newly impassioned by a mass shooting in his native El Paso that killed 22 people last month, is on an unvarnished quest to fill the void in moral leadership he sees in the era of Trump.\n\n\"Though we're connected to a president with no values and no morals, we're also connected as a people by our ambitions and aspirations,\" he told reporters over the weekend, later admitting that he might swear on the debate stage. \"Democrats, Republicans, independents, before any of those things, we are Americans first and need to start treating each other like it.\"\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who traded few barbs at the previous two debates while focusing on her roots in the Midwest -- and her ability to work across the aisle -- seeks to restore dignity to the presidency for \"all of America.\"\n\n\"I don't want to be the president for half of America, I want to be the president for all of America,\" she said Saturday after her speech to the New Hampshire Democratic Party.\n\nFor entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who is carving out his own base in the shape of an eclectic cult-like following, the debate stage is an opportunity to attract a wide swath of voters, across the ideological spectrum, as his substantive campaign seeks to make the masses \"think harder.\"\n\nPaul Sancya/AP\n\n\"We automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin. If those states sound familiar, those are all the swing states that Donald Trump needed to win and did win. So to me this was a straight automation story that immigrants are being scapegoated for economic problems they have little to nothing to do with ... It's not immigration, it's automation,\" he said in a recent interview with CBS This Morning.\n\nIn store this time around will be opportunities for the contenders to hash out differences that first drew sparks in the earlier rounds and across different stages.\n\nThe main event\n\nBut the main show will be at center stage, where Biden and Warren will face off side-by-side, as she continues to narrow the gap between them in recent polling. In an ABC News/Washington Post poll out this week, the former Harvard professor saw a six-point gain from June.\n\nBiden argued at a campaign stop in Laconia, New Hampshire on Friday that sharing the stage \"will be a good thing\" because he says, \"I\u2019ve never had to break through.\"\n\nWarren, too, appeared to dismiss a potential clash with Biden, telling ABC News it does \"not really\" change her approach.\n\n\"The way I see this is, this is a chance to talk to people all across the country, about how we've got a government that works great for the wealthy and the well connected, just not working for everyone else. And we got a chance to change that in 2020,\" she said.\n\nWhile all eyes seem to be on the moderate vs. progressive showdown between the two, an advisor for Biden suggested that he will be ready to take on Warren\u2019s \"I have a plan for that\" mantra -- saying Biden\u2019s plans were anything but middle of the road.\n\n\"I expect you\u2019ll see Biden echo an important point he made during last week's climate forum: We need more than plans, we need a president who can deliver progress on the most pressing issues facing Americans, which Joe Biden has proven he can throughout his career,\" the official told ABC News.\n\nABC News' John Verhovek and Molly Nagle contributed to this report.", "description": "Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren split center stage in the one-night matchup during ABC News' debate in Houston.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/democratic-debate-09-gty-jc-190912_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
