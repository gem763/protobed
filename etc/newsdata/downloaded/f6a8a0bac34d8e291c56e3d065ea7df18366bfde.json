Left-back Zinchenko is facing up to six weeks on the sidelines after undergoing minor knee surgery.\n\nThey join long-term knee injury victims Aymeric Laporte and Leroy Sane in the treatment room.\n\nJohn Stones is only just back in action after injury while Kevin De Bruyne, Nicolas Otamendi, Benjamin Mendy and Kyle Walker (illness) have all missed games this term.\n\nGuardiola, whose side host Aston Villa on Saturday, said: \u201cSome are muscular, others in the past were ligaments \u2013 (there are) not many we don\u2019t have. We are in a bad period in that sense.\n\nRodri has joined Manchester City\u00b4s injury list (Nick Potts/PA)\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m thinking after the international break \u2013 November, December, January, February \u2013 yes, I\u2019m a little bit concerned because in a few positions we don\u2019t have enough players.\u201d\n\nDespite potential shortages, Guardiola says the club have no plans to look to add to the squad in the January transfer window.\n\nEven though certain areas may need strengthening, City want to look long term when buying and the winter market is not seen as ideal to do business in.\n\nGuardiola said: \u201cI think we are not going to buy. The club didn\u2019t introduce me to the players they thought could help us, so without that it\u2019s not going to happen.\n\n\u201cOur need is not just for six months, it\u2019s for a long time and the important players will not be sold. We are going to stay all the season, I think, with all the players we have right now.\u201d\n\nIn recent games, midfielders Rodri and Fernandinho have both played in defence and Guardiola expects he may have to move more players around before the end of the season.\n\n2\u20e30\u20e30\u20e3 up!\n\n\n\nIf Fernandinho plays for @ManCity this weekend he'll bring up his 200th #PL appearance pic.twitter.com/zzNeADmAbM \u2014 Premier League (@premierleague) October 24, 2019\n\nHe said: \u201cI would prefer all the players had no injuries but I have to do it. We can\u2019t stop and complain, \u2018Oh what bad luck\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe have good players in the squad. In a few positions there are not many but we have incredibly good players. We\u2019re going with them.\u201d", "description": "Rodri and Oleksandr Zinchenko are the latest Man City players to be sidelined.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/04/wire-20206548-1572060860-554_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
