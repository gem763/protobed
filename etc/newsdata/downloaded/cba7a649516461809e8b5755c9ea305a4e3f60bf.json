In the Upside Down?\u201d Harbour asks, to which Davidson responds, \u201cYeah, dude. It\u2019s lit, right?\u201d\n\nDuring Davidson\u2019s time away, the comedian has actually been busy flexing his action chops, filming the new \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d movie with director James Gunn and co-stars Margot Robbie, Joel Kinnaman and Nathan Fillion.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who Davidson will be suiting up as in the sequel, but he\u2019s rumored to be a genius vigilante with a chemical imbalance named Savant.\n\nGunn posted a group photo of his cast on the night of the season 45 premiere of \u201cSNL\u201d after they watched an early screening of the hit film \u201cJoker.\u201d\n\nColin Jost was the first to poke fun at Davidson in last week\u2019s episode, addressing his absence with a dig during \u201cWeekend Update.\u201d\n\n\u201cA man who drove his car to a music festival still cannot remember where he parked his car a week after the show,\u201d Jost said during the segment. \u201cWell, we hope you make it back soon, Pete.\u201d\n\nDavidson, however, got the last laugh, showing up on \u201cWeekend Update\u201d this week to comment on, what else, the rise of treatable STDs due to the popularity of dating apps.\n\nHe also managed a jab at Jost\u2019s expense.\n\n\u201cI did hear your joke about me last week,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cCalling me that guy who lost his car at a music festival for a week, which I looked up, it was not me. And by the way Colin, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen the \u2018Joker.\u2019 But I think you should start being way nicer to me.\u201d", "description": "The comedian was noticeably absent from the season's opening episodes.", "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da33a3e210000e706344a76.png?cache=uin0qxo49m&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
