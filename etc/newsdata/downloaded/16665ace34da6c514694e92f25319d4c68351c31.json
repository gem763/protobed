Darrell Issa | Alex Wong/Getty Images Congress Darrell Issa accuses Menendez of trying to nix his nomination to lead trade agency\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Darrell Issa on Thursday accused Sen. Bob Menendez of trying to smear him to sink his nomination to be the next director of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency.\n\nAt a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Menendez told Issa he had significant concerns about the California congressman\u2019s FBI background file and warned members could find the information \u201cpotentially disqualifying for Senate confirmation.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut Issa fired back in an interview after the hearing and claimed Menendez was trying to relitigate wrongdoing from when the congressman was a teenager.\n\n\u201cSen. Menendez in open hearing refused to settle for asking me questions from that briefing ... and in fact was alleging that I was not qualified because of things that he saw in my record from when I was 17 years old,\u201d Issa said.\n\nHe added that the information Menendez is referring to is not new, and available on his Wikipedia page.

Menendez, at the hearing, said that every member on the committee should be able to review the information in Issa\u2019s background file.\n\n\u201cI openly admit that I had a colorful youth but Sen. Menendez is trying to convince people that a 65-year old man sitting there after 18 years in Congress... isn\u2019t qualified because he\u2019s not trustworthy,\u201d Issa said.\n\nIssa, who retired from Congress this year, is reportedly considering a run against Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.), who is facing federal public corruption charges. When asked why he was pursuing the administration role if he planned to challenge Hunter, Issa replied: \u201cI want to serve my country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI left Congress because I was offered an opportunity to serve in the administration,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that\u2019s not going to happen, I\u2019m going to seek and find a way to serve my country.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he would withdraw, Issa said that he had no announcement to make, but \u201cstay tuned.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any announcements today but I\u2019m going to seek counsel with all of my friends at the White House and back home,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll move forward next week.\u201d\n\n", "description": "\u201cI openly admit that I had a colorful youth,\" Issa says.", "authors": ["Marianne Levine"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/4f/74/959cefd04c25ae73b025dbd201e0/190919-issa-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
