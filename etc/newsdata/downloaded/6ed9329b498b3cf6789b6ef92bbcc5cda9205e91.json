REUTERS/Noor Khamis/File Photo\n\nHONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - Standard Chartered reported on Wednesday that third quarter profit rose a better-than-expected 16%, as a surge in business from corporate clients helped the bank weather unrest in its core market of Hong Kong and global trade tensions.\n\nStanChart\u2019s pretax profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 increased to $1.24 billion from $1.07 billion in the same period a year ago, above the $1 billion average of analysts\u2019 forecasts compiled by the lender.\n\nStanChart is in the midst of a second three-year turnaround plan under Chief Executive Bill Winters, with plans to double returns and dividends in three years by cutting $700 million in costs and boosting income.\n\nThe first of those in 2015-2018 focused on repairing a balance sheet ravaged by ill-advised lending in Asia, improving the bank\u2019s internal controls, reducing costs, and shedding unwanted businesses.\n\n\u201cThe continuing execution of that strategy remains our priority,\u201d Winters said in a statement.\n\nThe bank\u2019s corporate and institutional banking income grew 13% during the quarter, while private banking rose 14%, it said, adding its core capital ratio remained within the 13-14% target range at 13.5%.\n\nStanChart, however, flagged that there were \u201cgrowing headwinds from the combination of continuing geopolitical tensions and expectations of declining near-term global growth and interest rates\u201d.\n\nStanChart\u2019s bigger rival HSBC abandoned on Monday its own return target of greater than 11% by 2020, blaming a worsening revenue outlook and tougher than expected market conditions.\n\nThe London-listed shares of StanChart are up 14% so far this year, compared to a 9% drop in rival HSBC\u2019s shares.", "description": "Standard Chartered reported on Wednesday that third quarter profit rose a better-than-expected 16%, as a surge in business from corporate clients helped the bank weather unrest in its core market of Hong Kong and global trade tensions.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446412089&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T06X", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
