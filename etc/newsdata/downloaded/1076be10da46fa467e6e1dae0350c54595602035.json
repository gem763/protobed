He retired from the bank in 2018.\n\nHe is also the founder and remains on the board of Women's Community Shelters, which provides temporary crisis accommodation and support for homeless women and children.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long, however, before the two delegates were living together, splitting their time between Sydney and Melbourne.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a control freak and although I wanted very much to let go, I was afraid of relinquishing control,\" says de Jong, pictured in 2012 with one of the choirs she founded. Nine\n\n\u201cWhile we were very lucky and had a good relationship, I was aware there were things that were holding us back from our full potential,\u201d says de Jong.\n\nBoth had experienced trauma: Hunt's father died by suicide when Hunt was 13 and and de Jong is the child and grandchild of holocaust survivors. \"So I began searching for a way to create more interior substance, to deepen our relationship,\u201d she says.\n\nHunt was willing to explore whatever she found. \u201cI had never meditated, done yoga or consulted intuitive healers, but I was open to it, specially as we were still in the courtship phase.\u201d\n\nHer search eventually took them to psychotherapy assisted by mind-expanding drugs.\n\nThese drugs emerged into the mainstream in the 1940s, were used by hippies in the 1960s and banned in 1970. This brought most research to a halt, except in Switzerland.\n\nBut by 2010, there were signs of a renaissance. Researchers returned and about 100 trials have since been completed or are now under way, mainly in people with major depression or post-traumatic stress. Some remission rates have been promising.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith no major advances in the pipeline to treat these conditions, these drugs, if they work, have the potential to disrupt current practice and change the treatment paradigm.\n\nInterest is now high and universities such as Oxford, Cambridge, Kings College London, UCLA, Harvard, New York University, Yale and the universities of Zurich and Basel have active psychedelic research programs.\n\nAnd centres of excellence are popping up too. In April, London\u2019s prestigious Imperial College opened the Imperial Centre for Psychedelic Research.\n\nPsilocybin, or magic mushrooms, have shown promise in the treatment of mental illness.\n\nThen in September, leading United States medical complex Johns Hopkins followed suit and opened The Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research.\n\nThese psychedelics, or mind-revealing drugs, temporarily create changes in brain function which shift perception, thinking and feeling.\n\nThe best-known are psilocybin (magic mushrooms), mescaline, LSD, ayahuasca and dimethyltryptamine. Although not a psychedelic, MDMA (ecstasy) is often included because of its psychoactive effects and profound impact in treating trauma.\n\nDe Jong was keen to try psilocybin, and when she and Hunt didn\u2019t meet the criteria for any trials, she booked them into a private clinic in the Netherlands.\n\nOn the flight over, she was petrified. \u201cI\u2019m a control freak and although I wanted very much to let go, I was afraid of relinquishing control.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never been drunk; I\u2019d never done drugs and although this seemed like a safe way to lose control, these drugs had been so stigmatised; I was afraid my brain would be damaged.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHunt had read a couple of articles and was relaxed. \u201cTania had done the research and she wanted us to do this,\u201d he says. \"I went with no preconceptions.\"\n\nThey were taking a leap of faith in the hope this would help to clear some of their background trauma.\n\nBut how?\n\n\u201cWe all have a default pattern of thinking and reacting,\u201d says de Jong. \u201cWe consciously try and behave differently, but inevitably fall back into the default position.\n\n\u201cUnlike traditional philanthropy which helps small groups of people, this was an opportunity to create a benefit at scale,\u201d says Peter Hunt, pictured in 2015. Nine\n\n\u201cThe mechanical actions of the medicine are supposed to bypass the default-mode network. Rather than reverting to the same old patterns, you start to create new brain networks and these persist.\u201d\n\nPsilocybin therapy has three phases: preparation, the psychedelic experience and integration. The psychedelic part would take a day under full supervision.\n\n\u201cA therapist prepared us, there was a sense of ceremony, and we set some intentions,\u201d says de Jong. \u201cThen we drank it. It tasted just like chamomile tea.\u201d\n\nThey waited. Nothing happened for 30 minutes.\n\n\u201cThen colours come before you in psychedelic shapes and suddenly you are in a completely new world,\u201d says Hunt. \u201cYou get taken and are in a different plane of reality, very present and conscious, but de-identified, without ego.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI know some people get anxious and a few have a bad trip, but I didn\u2019t. It was like pushing a reset button. I emerged feeling very thoughtful and needed a long time to integrate the experience.\u201d\n\nAfterwards they felt connected with everything and each other. \u201cWe knew we had a real bond,\u201d says de Jong. \"It had been there all the time. This brought it to the fore.\"\n\nOver the next six months, the experience deepened. As a line from de Jong's song at the embassy says, they had moved towards \"a new way of living\".\n\nWanting to take this further, they began seriously investigating the medicinal use of these drugs, looking for a philanthropic opportunity.\n\nIt is very unusual for a government system to take over a philanthropic project. \u2014 Peter Hunt\n\nIt was significant that the US Food and Drug Administration had fast-tracked research and development into psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression and into ecstasy (MDMA) for post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n\u201cThe FDA designated them as 'breakthrough therapies' and it seemed pretty clear there was something substantial here, something with potential to benefit the broader society,\u201d says Hunt.\n\n\u201cUnlike traditional philanthropy, which helps small groups of people, this was an opportunity to create a benefit at scale.\u201d\n\nHow?\n\nIf, with philanthropic support, these drugs were proved effective, then legalised and medically regulated for the treatment of mental illness, the health system would take over and make treatment available to those in need.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is very unusual for a government system to take over a philanthropic project.\u201d\n\nGiven that mental illness is the leading cause of disability in Australia, Hunt and de Jong decided to do something.\n\nIn February this year, they launched Mind Medicine Australia, MMA, to develop regulatory-approved and research-backed psychedelic assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of mental illness in Australia.\n\nThey intend to build a centre of excellence to fund research, train therapists, produce an international summit, educate people and build awareness.\n\nThey don't advocate for the recreational use of psychedelics or for micro-dosing psychedelics, an emerging fashion in professional circles.\n\nThese drugs are not a panacea and are not given alone. They are bundled up with a sophisticated psychotherapeutic intervention. \u2014 David Castle, professor of psychiatry at St Vincent\u2019s Health and Melbourne University\n\nMMA is, however, part-funding a trial of psilocybin at Melbourne's St Vincent's with people suffering depression and anxiety at the end of their lives.\n\nDavid Castle, professor of psychiatry at St Vincent\u2019s Health and Melbourne University, says psychedelic-assisted treatments offer \u201cenormous potential\u201d as an alternative to current therapies, particularly for severe treatment-resistant depression and end-of-life anxiety.\n\nIn severe depression, conventional anti-depressants are only modestly successful whereas trials have shown drugs such as psilocybin are far more powerful in ameliorating depressive symptoms.\n\n\u201cThese drugs are not a panacea and are not given alone. They are bundled up with a sophisticated psychotherapeutic intervention. It sounds a bit poetic, but they appear to open the mind.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe says neurobiology is showing their impact on brain networks, on how they dampen the default network and increase other connections.\n\nProfessor David Nutt, a pioneer of the resurrection of psychedelic medicine, performed the imaging that demonstrated this impact.\n\nIt put some science behind psychedelics and the psychiatric profession is now more open-minded about these drugs, says Nutt, head of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College in London and an ambassador for MMA.\n\nBut people have rightly cautioned against becoming too enthusiastic. Their main concerns are that study sizes have been small and haven\u2019t been blinded, although that is difficult do when people are tripping. Bigger controlled studies are now under way.\n\n\"If trials do pan out, psychedelics will be a medicine in the next few years,\" he says.\n\nJill Margo is an adjunct associate professor at the University of NSW Sydney.", "description": "Peter Hunt, the former chairman of Greenhill, flew to the Netherlands to take psilocybin.
