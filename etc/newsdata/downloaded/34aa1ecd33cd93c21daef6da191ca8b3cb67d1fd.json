Get ready for an absolute bloodbath.", "language": "en", "text": "Opinion writer\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s Democratic rivals have now begun to raise questions about his age and mental competence. But they are doing so ever so gingerly, and even apologetically.\n\nPresident Trump is not being nearly as cautious or circumspect.\n\nIn that contrast resides something that deserves more attention about the Biden age issue. The question isn\u2019t merely whether Biden has the stamina for a grueling campaign, or whether Biden will be able to handle debates with Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s also whether Biden or indeed other Democrats are prepared for the massive onslaught of absolutely brutal and distortive attacks that Trump and his propaganda apparatus will wage on this particular front \u2014 attacks that you can be certain will include all sorts of shamelessly propagandistic media manipulation and outright disinformation tactics.\n\nThe big exchange at the Houston debate between Juli\u00e1n Castro and Biden on the topic of Biden\u2019s age is notable for how muted it seems. After some back-and-forth over Medicare, Castro pointedly asked: \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d\n\nNewly-minted pundit Rahm Emanuel promptly declared this \u201cmean.\u201d And after the debate, Castro immediately disavowed any such intentions, claiming it wasn\u2019t meant as a \u201cshot at his age.\u201d\n\n[David Byler: Biden\u2019s age is a real issue. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy to talk about.]\n\nCory Booker was similarly cautious. After the debate, Booker carefully supported Castro, noting that many people are \u201cconcerned about Joe Biden\u2019s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling,\u201d in a \u201clong, grueling campaign.\u201d The implication was clear, but unstated.\n\nNow contrast all that with Trump\u2019s approach. He gave a speech to Republicans during the debate, in which he mocked \u201cSleepy Joe,\u201d adding: \u201cHe\u2019s falling asleep. He has no idea what the hell he\u2019s doing or saying.\u201d\n\nThere is something deeply absurd, of course, about Trump raising questions about Biden\u2019s fitness in a speech in which Trump rambled bizarrely about how light bulbs make him \u201clook orange.\u201d\n\nBut Trump\u2019s comments should be taken as a sign of what\u2019s to come \u2014 not from him alone, but from his massive disinformation machine.\n\nA taste of what\u2019s coming\n\nFor a taste of what this will look like, watch the disgusting video that the Trump campaign released after Hillary Clinton fell ill in 2016. It juxtaposes terrorist imagery with footage of Clinton coughing, stumbling outside her campaign van, and even a shot of a frail Clinton struggling to climb stairs. This whole line, as Media Matters documented, was heavily amplified by right-wing media.\n\nThat will look like video of a knitting session compared with this time, which will likely include full-saturation levels of deliberate disinformation. Look at this distorted video of Nancy Pelosi slowed down to look drunk, and imagine distorted videos of Biden\u2019s rambles.\n\nWe might even get deepfakes \u2014 ultra-sophisticated computer-altered videos \u2014 done by somebody, somewhere, making Biden look even more frail, committing verbal stumbles he never actually committed.\n\nSuch things will be spread widely across social media, with the help of platforms not self-policing adequately, and shared with tens of millions of people via the Twitter feed of the president of the United States.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable that Democrats want to be cautious about this topic, since they\u2019re wary of alienating Democratic voters, and harbor genuine good will and respect toward Biden himself. Trump, and especially his propagandists, who will operate at a degree of separation from Trump himself, will be under no such constraints \u2014 or any constraints, really.\n\nThis eventuality is not Biden\u2019s fault. But the episode at the debate that raised all the concerns about Biden\u2019s long-term fitness did actually happen: Biden\u2019s answer to a question about slavery really was a rambling mess that detoured into strange comments about record players.\n\nIt\u2019s not fair to treat this as all that defining of the evening: Biden did turn in a performance that was often very energetic and combative. He mixed it up on policy in a way that plainly got across his intended message \u2014 he\u2019s unapologetic about his embrace of Barack Obama, and is not the candidate who will imperil the Democrats\u2019 general-election chances by threatening too much disruption from the left.\n\n[2020 Power Ranking: The winner of the debate? Nobody.]\n\nBut worries about Biden\u2019s age and stamina are not unreasonable, given all we\u2019ve seen. Related questions about Biden\u2019s competence are something we should be debating, as political scientist Dave Hopkins points out.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t necessarily that Trump will best him in debates. When Trump mocks Biden directly to his face by scoffing that he\u2019s asleep on his feet \u2014 which will happen \u2014 Biden will likely counter this by highlighting Trump\u2019s obvious unfitness.\n\nHandled correctly, Biden stands a good chance of coming out better in such exchanges. Swing voters \u2014 particularly aging ones already alienated by Trump\u2019s ugliness and depravity \u2014 will probably side with Biden and overlook his foibles.\n\nBut the all-but-certain magnification of subterranean voter concerns about Biden\u2019s fitness and stamina \u2014 via unchecked disinformation and media manipulation \u2014 is something to start thinking about. Even if it doesn\u2019t end up moving that many voters, it\u2019ll be positively awful for our discourse, and will require a forceful and concerted response that is up to the moment we\u2019re in.\n\nThis includes the media, which should be currently debating how to handle this type of disinformation onslaught.\n\nDo they know what they\u2019re up against?\n\nWe need to know that Biden, and indeed many establishment Democrats, are ready for this. Which feeds into a much broader topic: whether they know what they\u2019re truly up against here.\n\nWhen Biden talks about winning over Republicans who subtly fed the birther conspiracy, unabashedly held a Supreme Court seat, refused a united front against Russian sabotage of our democracy, and, now, won\u2019t help safeguard our political system against another attack, the bigger question is whether Biden fully appreciates what the parts of the contemporary right wing that happily allied with Trump are made of.\n\nThe coming disinformation warfare on Biden\u2019s age is of a piece with that. Biden and Democratic Party officials very well may appreciate what they\u2019re facing. If so, we need to hear it.\n\nRead more:\n\nJennifer Rubin: Moderates stood out in the third debate.
