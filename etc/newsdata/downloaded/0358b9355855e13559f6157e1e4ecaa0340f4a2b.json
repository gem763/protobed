(Picture: Instagram)\n\nHe might be suave and sophisticated now, but that wasn\u2019t always the case for Dwayne Johnson, who revealed his classmates thought he was an undercover cop as he posted an epic throwback photo.\n\nDwayne shared the picture of \u2018The Rock aged 15\u2019 on Instagram, showing his much smaller physique and \u2018pornstache\u2019.\n\nHe told his followers how he was ostracised by his classmates who were convinced he was an undercover police officer when he moved from Hawaii to Nashville, Tennessee as a teenager.\n\nDwayne, 47, wrote: \u2018#flashbackfriday to that special time when I was a 15yr old punk kid, 6\u20194, barely 200lbs, creepy mustache and forced to leave Hawai\u2019i to live in Nashville, TN \u2013 where I just enrolled in a new high school \u2013 and EVERYONE (students and teachers) treated me like I had the plague and stayed away because they were all convinced I was an undercover cop. True story.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I had a WILD and unbelievable life and journey as a kid and teenager. Kickin\u2019 puberty\u2019s a** from day 1. #PornstacheJohnson #YoureUnderArrest\u2019.\n\nNow we can kind of see why they may have thought he was an undercover cop given that he was 6\u20194 and had a moustache at 15 \u2013 even if he was yet to bulk up to The Rock size.\n\nCreepy moustache? Check. Retro boombox? Check. A middle-aged cop posing as a high school kid? Massive check. (Picture: Instagram @therock)\n\nFans were quick to comment on the \u2013 frankly spectacular \u2013 photo to share their disbelief that he looked like a fully grown man at 15.\n\nOne wrote: \u201815?!!! It\u2019s fair to say the genetic Gods were kind to you Rock\u2019 and another added: \u2018Age 15?? Nah!!! This looks like a family man!!\u2019\n\nOthers commented: \u2018plot twist! The rock is still an undercover cop but just posing as a bada** celebrity!\u2019 and \u2018You look younger now!\u2019\n\nThe only thing we have to say is thank God he got rid of the \u2018tache.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
