PewDiePie said he wanted to instead pick a charity he was \"personally passionate about,\" and that it didn't feel \"genuine\" to make the donation to the ADL.\n\nPewDiePie, whose real name is Felix Kjellberg, had said a day earlier that he was making the $50,000 donation as a way to \"move past\" controversies. But the announcement was met with condemnation from fans, who questioned why PewDiePie was making a donation to the ADL, a group that has previously spoken out against him. Some of his fan base also floated conspiracy theories across social media that PewDiePie was being blackmailed by the ADL into making the donation.\n\nRead more: The career of PewDiePie, the controversial 29-year-old who says he's 'definitely' worth more than $20 million\n\nIn explaining why he was retracting his donation, PewDiePie said he'd \"made the mistake of picking a charity that I was advised, instead of picking a charity that I'm personally passionate about.\" Now, PewDiePie said he plans to take the time to \"properly\" choose where to contribute his $50,000 donation, something made possible by a partnership with coupon-finding browser extension Honey.\n\nPewDiePie said Thursday he saw the donation as an \"opportunity\" to separate himself from the alt right. In March, the suspect in a mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, told viewers on a livestream to \"subscribe to PewDiePie\" moments before more than 50 people were killed.\n\n\"[The donation] wasn't to try to clear my name or save grace. If it was, I would've done it years ago,\" PewDiePie said in his YouTube video. \"But after the Christchurch tragedy, I felt a responsibility to do something about it, because it's no longer just about me. It affected other people in a way, and I'm not OK with that.\"\n\nPewDiePie has been attached to several controversies in his nearly decade-long career of being a YouTuber. He's uttered racial slurs and made Nazi jokes in his videos and on his livestreams. In 2017, nine videos of his were found to include \"anti-Semitic jokes or Nazi imagery.\"\n\nIn the wake of the revelation, Disney cut ties with PewDiePie, a move that the ADL commended.\n\n\"This is clearly hate speech ... PewDiePie's effort to defend it as an attempt to be funny falls flat,\" ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement in 2017. \"PewDiePie is entitled to his views, but neither Disney nor any other company has any obligation to support his wide dissemination of hate speech.\"\n\nAfter PewDiePie made his initial announcement about the ADL donation, his fan base was quick to criticize the YouTuber, an outspoken free-speech advocate, for giving money to an organization they say has helped to clamp down on free speech by policing hate speech.\n\n\"His money would have been used to destroy the livelihoods of other content creators, which is no bueno,\" one Reddit user said. \"I'm happy he's researched them more and saw that.\"\n\nPewDiePie nor Honey responded to Business Insider's request for comment by the time of publication.\n\nThe ADL said in a statement that the organization has not been in contact with PewDiePie at all \"beyond his public posts.\"\n\n\"ADL learned about the potential donation from Felix Kjellberg when everyone else did: when he made the announcement on his channel earlier this week,\" an ADL spokesperson told Business Insider.", "description": "PewDiePie \u2014 real name Felix Kjellberg \u2014 said a day earlier he was making the $50,000 donation as a way to \"move past\" his controversies.", "authors": ["Paige Leskin"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7a7e922e22af080e5d6683-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
