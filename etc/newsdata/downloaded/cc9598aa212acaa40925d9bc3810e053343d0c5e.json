Bernie Sanders said on Labor Day, \u201cWe honor and respect the millions and millions and millions of men and women who do the hard work that keeps this country going.\u201d\n\nThe populist independent senator from Vermont \u2013 speaking to reporters ahead of marching in the largest annual Labor Day parade in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire \u2013 added it\u2019s a day to spotlight \u201cthe needs of working families.\u201d Sanders, once again, made his pitch to raise the minimum wage to \u201ca living wage,\u201d gender pay equality, and to make \u201cit easier for workers to be able to join unions.\u201d\n\nSanders has been making a hard sell for labor support while running a second straight time for the presidential nomination. As he unveiled his \u201cWorkplace Democracy\u201d plan last month, he called for doubling union membership and giving workers the right to strike without the fear of their jobs being filled by replacement workers.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS' WARNING TO THE 'CORPORATE ELITE'\n\nMeanwhile, halfway across the country, former Vice President Joe Biden was greeting voters at the Hawkeye Area Labor Council Labor Day Picnic in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the state that votes first in the nominating calendar.\n\nThe front-runner among the 2020 Democrats promised in an email to supporters that \u201cif I\u2019m elected president, together, we\u2019ll protect and strengthen the right to organize and collectively bargain.\u201d\n\nBiden held the first rally of his latest White House bid at a union hall in Pittsburgh. And, on the campaign trail, the former vice president repeatedly had emphasized his longtime close ties with organized labor.\n\nBiden\u2019s message to union workers this Labor Day: \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the battles you\u2019ve waged and victories you\u2019ve won, and I\u2019ll never forget to stand with you and with labor unions every day.\u201d\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, the third of the current top-three contenders among the Democrats, said in a message Monday to union members that \u201cthe playing field today is tilted against working families, and that is why now, more than ever, America needs a strong labor movement.\u201d\n\nThe progressive senator from Massachusetts emphasized, \u201cI\u2019m proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with the labor movement and with working men and women across this country.\u201d\n\nBut, while Biden, Sanders, Warren and many of the other candidates have been courting organized labor, unions appeared in no rush to jump in and make endorsements as the record-setting field of Democrats battled for the party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\nBiden, to date, has been the only candidate to land a major national union endorsement. The International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) backed him days after he jumped into the race. The smaller United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America union endorsed Sanders last week.\n\nIt\u2019s a switch from four years ago when many of the powerful national unions weighed in early \u2013 as most of them backed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nThis time around, with the White House hopefuls mostly in agreement on union-friendly causes such as the push for a $15-per-hour minimum wage, there\u2019s been less of an incentive for labor to endorse early in the process.\n\n\u201cI think we have a plethora of good candidates. I think the vetting process is much more in-depth this time around than last time around. We only had basically two candidates,\u201d New Hampshire AFL-CIO President Glenn Brackett told Fox News.\n\nA veteran Democratic strategist with close ties to organized labor said some unions were sitting on the sidelines apparently because they\u2019re worried they\u2019ll endorse the wrong candidate.\n\n\u201cNo union wants to be the one that steps out and messes up unity at the convention or unity in the party to actually beat Donald Trump,\u201d said the strategist, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely.\n\n\u201cIt is the culture of this party right now to \u2018just win\u2019 and don\u2019t worry about who it is. It needs to be someone more to the center. So, no union wants to step out to endorse somebody further to the left early and create some fight that will, later down the road if Trump is re-elected, be blamed for messing up,\u201d the strategist added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile Trump didn\u2019t land any major union endorsements in 2016, he did gain the support of plenty of rank-and-file members. Clinton won the union vote by just 8 percentage points, down from President Barack Obama\u2019s 18-point margin over GOP nominee Mitt Romney in the 2012 election.\n\nBut, Brackett said he thought Trump\u2019s in for a rude awakening in 2020, telling Fox News the president \u201cblew a lot of smoke and a lot of people believed him. And, I think after the last three years of seeing his behavior, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to enjoy the same dept of support from union members that he did in the last election. I think he\u2019s in for a big surprise this time around.\u201d", "description": "Presidential candidate Sen.
