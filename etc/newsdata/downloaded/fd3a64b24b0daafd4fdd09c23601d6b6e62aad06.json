It is thought these can have detrimental effects on pregnancy outcome, including increased miscarriages and premature births.\n\nResearchers said it was important to understand whether these particles affected pregnancy directly or by triggering a response in the mother's body.\n\nThe authors wrote: \"Our results demonstrate that the human placental barrier is not impenetrable for particles.\n\n\"Our observation based on exposure conditions in real-life is in agreement with previously reported ex vivo and in vivo studies studying the placental transfer of various nanoparticles.\"\n\nAndrew Shennan, professor of obstetrics at King's College London, said the findings were \"a concern\" and warranted further investigation.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
