Are they saying you are only ever three steps away from danger?\n\n\u201cEveryone was watching, and knew we were the reason the ride was delayed.\n\n\u201cAnyone that knows Sebby has been bored to death by his knowledge and love of Ninjago.\u201d\n\nMs Brett said after they finished on the ride, her son asked her: \u201cWhy would they make a disabled person walk? It really hurt.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cIf they\u2019d have asked him to do it a month ago he wouldn\u2019t have been able to and it would have ruined the whole day.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

They also need to reconsider how inclusive their park is.\u201d\n\nShe added staff needed better training on how to deal with disabled children.\n\nA spokesman for the park apologised for any distress caused to the family, but said the policy was \u201cnecessary\u201d.\n\nThey said: \u201cThe health and safety of our guests is always our priority and we have a number of requirements in place to allow our guests with disabilities and additional needs to enjoy our rides.\n\n\u201cOn some rides, such as Lego Ninjago The Ride, guests are required to walk unaided. This is necessary in the case of guests being evacuated from the ride, as they would be required to walk during the evacuation process.\n\n\u201cWe are always working to make the resort more accessible and constantly review our processes.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Press Association", "description": "A five-year-old boy who is dependent on his wheelchair was twice ordered to stand up and walk by staff at Legoland before being allowed to go on the rides.
