Dan Bishop faces Democrat Dan McCready in the 9th District, which stretches across south-central North Carolina from Charlotte to Fayetteville.\n\nThe special election is a do-over of last year\u2019s midterm contest in which Republican Mark Harris beat Mr. McCready by 905 votes but the results were scratched because of absentee ballot fraud linked to the Harris campaign.\n\nFollowing the high drama of the election scandal, both sides say voters have tuned out the summer campaigns and extremely low turnout expected for the Sept. 10 special election make the outcome a crapshoot.\n\nDemocrats are licking their chops about winning a district Mr. Trump carried by 11 points in 2016.\n\n\u201cIf Dan McCready wins that election, Republicans will be running scared across the country,\u201d said Thomas Mills, a Democratic strategist and commentator in North Carolina.\n\nNorth Carolina GOP Chairman Michael Whatley described Mr. Bishop as playing catch-up in the race but voiced optimism he would win.\n\n\u201cDespite the fact that Dan McCready has been campaigning for almost three years, the polls are tied and Dan Bishop has all the momentum in this race,\u201d he said. \u201cWith dozens of events and a solid ground game in place over the next four weeks, we see the district staying Republican.\u201d\n\nMr. Bishop gained national prominence as the author of the state\u2019s \u201cbathroom bill\u201d that required people to use the public restrooms corresponding with their biological sex. The 2016 law touched off protests and boycotts of North Carolina before it was repealed a year later as part of a bipartisan deal.\n\nMr. Bishop beat nine other Republicans in the May 14 primary. Mr. Harris did not run.\n\nThe prospect of extremely low turnout has shaped the race. A veteran state GOP operative said the turnout likely will look like a municipal election.\n\n\u201cLow turnout elections are always unique and a lot of it is fought out on the ground. So it is a real slugfest,\u201d the GOP operative said.\n\nEyeing turnout, Mr. Bishop is playing strictly to the GOP base with a pro-Trump message. He is promising to fight \u201ccrazy liberal clowns\u201d in Washington.\n\nMr. McCready, a Marine veteran, is running a replay of the midterm race with a focus on health care reform, the same message that helped get enough moderate Democrats elected last year to take control of the House.\n\nHe is also avoiding attacks on Mr. Trump that could energize his opponent\u2019s supporters.\n\n\u201cThis campaign is for the people who bring us together and put country before political party and fight for people again instead of this broken partisan politics,\u201d Mr. McCready said at a candidate forum Monday hosted by the NAACP branch in Fayetteville, according to The Charlotte Observer.\n\nMr. Bishop did not attend the forum. Mr. McCready was joined on stage at the forum by Libertarian Jeff Scott and Green Party candidate Allen Smith, who will be on the ballot next month.\n\nIn recent weeks, two GOP groups poured $4 million into TV ads to boost Mr. Bishop. The National Republican Congressional Committee bought $2.6 million our air time. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC linked to House Republican leadership, ponied up $1.2 million for TV ads, with more spending to come.\n\nThe outside spending by Republican groups has helped make up for Mr. McCready out-fundraising Mr. Bishop $3.2 million to $1.2 million.\n\nDemocratic groups such as Stand Up Republic, an anti-Trump super PAC, also have been putting money into the race.\n\nThe biggest spender behind Mr. McCready has been the Environmental Defense Action Fund and its super PAC, EDF Action Votes, spending a combined $586,000, according to a report by Open Secrets.\n\nDemocratic committees also are funneling money into a get-out-the-vote effort.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
