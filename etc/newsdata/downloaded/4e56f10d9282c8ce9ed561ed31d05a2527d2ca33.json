Yet, if all nations act that way \u2014 indeed, that's what's happening \u2014 most countries would eventually be worse off due to the cumulative impacts of all our emissions.\n\nPut another way, what's better for each individual country in isolation is actually worse for the planet as a whole. Conversely, what is worse for each individual country, over time would be better for the planet.\n\nRepublicans often argue the U.S. shouldn't reduce its emissions since China and India aren't reducing theirs. That's how the collective action problem works, and it could prevent even modest efforts addressing the problem.\n\nBy contrast, most other policies are not nearly as directly dependent upon global cooperation. Take, for example, gay rights. Same-sex marriage is legal in roughly 30 countries, yet same-sex sexual activity is considered a criminal act in 70 nations.\n\nThe bottom line: Action (or inaction) on climate change is by definition unable to occur in national silos.\n\nTime disconnect\n\nEnacting policies today to cut greenhouse gas emissions won't have a discernible impact on global warming for decades, if not centuries. That's because we have already locked in significant warming due to our historical emissions. This makes it a tough sell, but especially in our 2- to 6-year election cycles.\n\nJoe Biden's climate plan promises net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, a common benchmark among other Democratic presidential hopefuls \u2014 and climate science broadly. Biden would be pushing 110 years old when he'd have to check (likely from the afterlife) on how his policy did. I'll be 65. How old will you be?\n\nUnlike other policies, climate change is cumulative. The longer we wait to address it, the bigger the problem it becomes and the harder it gets to solve, fueling a feedback loop that makes solutions ever more difficult.\n\nBy contrast, passing legislation on most other public policy issues aren't cumulative and would result in almost immediate, direct impact on millions of people.\n\nA new health care law can affect people on day 1 of enactment.\n\nPresident Trump's immigration policies have had near instantaneous impacts on people.\n\nThe bottom line: Big climate policy would have to offer concrete benefits outside of its impact on emissions \u2014 think jobs or energy security \u2014 to overcome this time disconnect.\n\nPay now and pay later\n\nClimate change presents two separate costs.\n\nCost No. 1: Responding to flooding, heat waves and other extreme weather that climate change is often making worse.\n\nResponding to flooding, heat waves and other extreme weather that climate change is often making worse. Cost No. 2: Enacting policies to reduce emissions, which would come in the form of higher fossil-fuel costs today.\n\nEnacting policies to reduce emissions, which would come in the form of higher fossil-fuel costs today. Cost No. 1 will continue for decades, if not centuries, even in addition to Cost No. 2. This is because of the aforementioned time disconnect: the amount of warming locked in already has also locked in associated costs \u2014 which will come in the form of not just money, but also health, lives and nature losses.\n\nThe costs hit different parts of America and the world disproportionately, setting the stage for conflict, not cooperation (further complicating the first point).\n\nLow-lying nations whose very existences are at risk due to climate change have a very different set of cost concerns than Saudi Arabia.\n\nBy contrast, you invest money in your 401(K) with a reasonable level of confidence you\u2019ll get it when you retire. Imagine getting taxed before you put that money into your fund and then not living long enough to reap the payoffs of your fund. That\u2019s happening with climate change, on a global scale.\n\nThe bottom line: We are the first generation of humans to start paying the price for a warmer world, and we are also the first to face costs as we try to address it. We\u2019re paying now and later.\n\nWhat's next: Next week's column will tackle our stubborn \u2014 yet effective \u2014 energy system.", "description": "Collective action and time/cost disconnects.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/AZvMd5fbtYyQFaju5dg155pwNUo=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/08/16/1565977765349.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-19"}
