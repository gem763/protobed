The 29-year-old software engineer, based in Noida, narrates her swipe-right experiences, and states that she notices a pattern in her meetings. \u201cThis has happened several times now\u2014I meet someone online, the man shows tremendous interest, I go with the flow and then, suddenly, one day, he says that things are getting too intense and he doesn\u2019t want to commit. I end up questioning myself, \u2018Is something wrong with me? or, am I just attracting the wrong kind of men?\u2019\u201dIn Pandey\u2019s case, the men have been honest; and made it amply clear that commitment is indeed an issue for them. However, PR consultant Seema Das* continues to have no clue why her former partner of five years severed ties with her without an explanation. \u201cHe seemed interested in committing, and wooed me fiercely, but when I finally wanted to have a serious discussion on whether we could actually consider settling down, he dumped me unceremoniously,\u201d says the Mumbai-based 32-year-old. Unfortunately, both scenarios are all too familiar to scores of women who have borne the brunt of men distancing themselves at the mention of commitment. Undoubtedly, it\u2019s painful and can scar one for life. Now, how does one deal with such situations? Let our guide help you.Several factors fuel fear of commitment. According to experts, some of the most common factors that abet such issues are a history of infidelity, abuse or abandonment, low self-esteem, difficulty in trusting people, parents\u2019 marital problems and a general fear of ending up in unsatisfactory relationships. \u2018\u2018Typically, many people with commitment issues have also complained of having experienced poor romantic relationships or have watched their parents be acrimonious to each other while growing up,\u2019\u2019 says Dr Anuneet Sabharwal, a Delhi-based psychiatrist. Thus, get to the bottom of it, and try to find out if an incident in his past is making him nervous. It is possible that he himself isn\u2019t aware of the underlying causes behind his resistance. In such cases, seek a counsellor\u2019s help.Before you go all out to help your man, ensure that you are ready to give the relationship your all. Ask yourself if you see yourself settling down with your current partner sooner or later. What are your priorities? Are you falling prey to peer pressure and the desire to settle down just for the sake of it? Self-clarity can help you empathise with your partner and understand his reservations, if any, about commitment. \u201cIf you are confident, convey your decision to your partner, seek his views and wait for him to reach a decision,\u201d says Niharika Mehta, psychologist, Hiranandani Hospital, Vashi. Patience is the key.Commitment implies that a person is pledging his loyalty to you voluntarily. At the same time, he will expect a certain level of independence in the relationship. Experts say that you should not be encouraging a situation where he could feel that his freedom is being trampled upon; don\u2019t try to change or force your ideas on him. \u201cFor me, children are a priority in a long-term relationship. My ex used to avoid any discussion on the matter. In fact, I tried to reason that children can be a fulfilling experience for both partners. But he wasn\u2019t keen on hearing me out, Eventually, I stopped bringing the subject up,\u201d says Das. Furthermore, in the midst of figuring out the situation, don\u2019t take your individuality for granted. \u201cIt is important to remember that you lead a life that can be different than your partner\u2019s,\u201d says Mehta. Pursue your own interests without feeling guilty, she advises.Do not think commitment is a natural ally of physical intimacy. Pandey learned the hard way. \u201cWhen you get physically intimate, you normally tend to think that the man is into you, and you can expect the fledgling relationship to take a serious turn. But now, I am more cautious, and gauge beforehand if these are mere hook-ups.\u201d The moral of the story: it\u2019s unwise to expect a man to commit because you have had sex with him. \u201cYes, sex is one way of expressing love, but it is not the only way. Over a period of time, the excitement will fade, and compatibility problems will show up. It is possible that men and women unknowingly use sex to get attention, but do make sure that sex does not become the driving force of your relationship,\u201d cautions Mehta.If the relationship is going through a rough patch, your man may reconsider committing. \u201cIf you are suffering more lows than highs in your relationship, it creates a negative association which in turn leads to stress. No one chooses to stay in a stressful environment,\u201d says Mehta. To reduce the tension, address the issues openly, accept differences and make an effort to put the relationship back on track. \u201cMake sure to point out that he's truly irreplaceable, gain his trust,\u201d says Dr Sabharwal. \u201cAlso make sure that you introduce him to your close friends.\u201d In other words, hang out with friends and do fun things together \u2014 the idea is make him want to be in a relationship with you, according to experts.*All names are changed on requestAt the outset, it should be mentioned that it isn\u2019t a psychological disorder, according to mental health experts. \u201cEveryone wishes to have a partner who offers unconditional love and support. However, promising that can be challenging for both men and women. Commonly \u2018commitment phobia\u2019 refers to the fear and anxiety associated with an obligation that binds an individual to another,\u201d explains Mehta.. But, a fear of commitment does not mean a person is incapable of committing. \u201cIt means that the fear and anxiety of not being able to back out or withdraw, say, from a relationship, is overwhelming,\u201d adds Mehta.While the popular perception is that men are more commitment-phobic than women, research shows that this may not necessarily be true. In fact, there are studies that challenge this notion. Take a 2013 study by Pew Research for instance, which showcased that 83 per cent of the men and 88 per cent of the women the survey covered were \u201ccompletely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d committed to their partner.In this blockbuster, Hugh Grant plays a philanderer who loves women and later discovers that being a parent isn't quite as scary as he thought.In the project, Ranbir Kapoor is a thrill seeker who chooses to chase his dreams even if that means staying away from loved ones.
