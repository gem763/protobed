Wagers filed a lawsuit against the hotel Friday\n\nWagers said she and her friend had just finished dinner at the Maritana Grille (pictured), inside the hotel, when they happened to see a waiter pouring liquid nitrogen over another diner's dessert. After telling the waiter the smoke looked cool, he poured the liquid into their water\n\nThe FDA has warned against drinking, eating or handling food prepared with liquid nitrogen, a freezing agent, which creates a smokey effect, due to potential injury (file image)\n\nWagers was then rushed to the hospital, where she had surgery to remove her gallbladder, as well as portions of her stomach which had been burned by the liquid nitrogen. She also had to stay in the ICU for several days.\n\nHer attorney, Adam Brum, told NBC News that Wagers has lost more than 25 pounds as a result of the incident and is expected to have lifelong digestion issues.\n\nAccording to Wagers' lawsuit, filed Friday and obtained by ABC Action News, the hotel and its employees 'should have known that drinking the liquid nitrogen was dangerous' and that Wagers 'was completely unaware of the danger of drinking the liquid nitrogen poured into her glass by the waiter.'\n\nThe lawsuit - filed against the hotel and the restaurant's director of food and beverage - also claims that the hotel staffers should have trained its employees to adequately warn customers about the dangers and possible injuries of ingesting liquid nitrogen.\n\n'You're not supposed to just pour it in someone's drink and allow them to just take a big gulp of this,' Brum said.\n\nIn August 2018, the FDA issued an alert warning customers and retailers 'of the potential for serious injury from eating, drinking, or handling food products prepared by adding liquid nitrogen at the point of sale, immediately before consumption'.\n\n'Liquid nitrogen, although non-toxic, can cause severe damage to skin and internal organs if mishandled or accidentally ingested due to the extremely low temperatures it can maintain,' the FDA added.\n\nWagers' lawsuit stated that she is suing both the hotel and the food and beverage director of more than $15,000 each and is seeking a jury trial.", "description": "Stacey Wagers, 45, of Tampa, Florida, is suing the Don Cesar Hotel in St. Pete Beach, Florida, after a waiter poured liquid nitrogen into her water glass and she drank it on her birthday.", "authors": ["Maxine Shen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/05/19675980-0-image-a-65_1571027255511.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
