A survey has found that Britons view the embattled prime minister as a top Halloween costume choice.\n\nAccording to a survey of 2,000 British parents and children, Johnson \u2013 whose deadline to leave the EU coincidentally lands on October 31 \u2013 is the 10th most popular costume choice for those gearing up for a night of ghoulish candy-collecting.\n\nConducted by Beano Studios, the poll found that the most popular costume choice was Pennywise, the terrifying clown from \u2018IT 2.\u2019 Hulk, the Joker, Spider-Man and the Minecraft Creeper are among the other costume ideas that edged out BoJo.\n\nRespondents said that Johnson and US President Donald Trump were among the \u201cscariest\u201d celebrities of the 21st century.\n\nAlso on rt.com Brexit stasis: EU foot-dragging & parliamentary stonewalling have led to \u2018very un-British coup\u2019 in UK, George Galloway says\n\nBut even those who won\u2019t be donning Johnson\u2019s iconic blonde mop for Halloween may still make reference to Brexit with their costume. The survey revealed that more than half of British families plan to incorporate Brexit into their Halloween festivities this year.\n\n\u201cWith Brexit on everyone\u2019s lips, it\u2019s unsurprising that we\u2019ll be seeing a horde of mini Borises taking over the streets of the UK this Halloween, with a Jeremy Corbyn or two,\u201d Mike Stirling, editorial director of Beano Studios, said.\n\nLike this story?
