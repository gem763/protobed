And I have tried, during this period, to find a way out, through which to listen to the voice of the people,\u201d Hariri said in his speech.\n\n\u201cIt is time for us to have a big shock to face the crisis. I am going to the Baabda (presidential) palace to present the resignation of the government. To all partners in political life, our responsibility today is how we protect Lebanon and revive its economy.\u201d\n\nIn central Beirut, black-clad men wielding sticks and pipes wrecked the protest camp that has been the focal point of countrywide rallies against the long entrenched elite.\n\nThe turmoil has worsened Lebanon\u2019s acute economic crisis, with financial strains leading to a scarcity of hard currency and a weakening of the pegged Lebanese pound. Lebanese government bonds tumbled on the turmoil.\n\nThe show of force in Beirut came after Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said last week roads closed by protesters should be reopened and suggested the demonstrators were financed by its foreign enemies and implementing their agenda.\n\nIt is the most serious strife on the streets of Beirut since 2008, when Hezbollah fighters seized control of the capital in a brief eruption of armed conflict with Lebanese adversaries loyal to Hariri.\n\nMohamed Azakir / Reuters Lebanon's Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri speaks during a news conference in Beirut, Lebanon October 29, 2019.

Tear gas was eventually fired to disperse the crowds.\n\nMohamed Azakir / Reuters Men pull tents that were set-up by anti-government protesters in Beirut, Lebanon October 29, 2019.

The report weighed on Lebanese dollar bonds.\n\nCentral bank governor Riad Salameh called on Monday for a solution to the crisis in just days to restore confidence and avoid a future economic meltdown.\n\nA black market for U.S. dollars has emerged in the last month or so. Three foreign currency dealers said a dollar cost 1,800 pounds on Tuesday, weakening from levels of 1,700 and 1,740 cited on Monday.\n\nThe official pegged rate is 1,507.5 pounds to the dollar. Salameh told Reuters on Monday the central bank would maintain the pegged rate when banks reopen.\n\n\u201cEven if the protesters leave the streets the real problem facing them is what they are going to do with the devaluation of the pound,\u201d said Toufic Gaspard, an economist who has worked as an adviser to the IMF and to the Lebanese finance minister.\n\n\u201cA very large majority of the Lebanese income is in the Lebanese pound, their savings are in the Lebanese pound and their pension is in Lebanese, and it is certain it has already started to devalue,\u201d he said.\n\n(Reporting by Eric Knecht, Laila Bassam, Ellen Francis, Tom Perry, Lisa Barrington, Samia Nakhoul and Reuters TV; Writing by Tom Perry; Editing by Mark Heinrich)", "description": "Saad al-Hariri stepped down after a Hezbollah-aligned group attacked protesters in Beirut.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db8571a20000099335071f2.jpeg?cache=qj8fdzsa4h&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
