During Vietnam, an influx of \u201cdrug-ridden and dispirited\u201d draftees portended the rise of \u201cfragging,\u201d as detailed by Marine Colonel Robert D. Heinl in 1971: deliberate attacks on officers for whom they refused to fight. Through much of the remainder of the twentieth century, American grunts echoed the helicopter gunner in Full Metal Jacket in seeking to \u201cget some,\u201d a none-too-subtly sexual stand-in for the glory of the kill.\n\nIn the twenty-first century Department of Defense, however, there\u2019s an official euphemism for American troops\u2019 considerable killing ability. It comes from on high, but\u2014having been repeated ad absurdum\u2014it can be heard throughout the ranks. Welcome to the cult of \u201clethality,\u201d the lasting legacy of former Defense Secretary James Mattis. Though Mattis is busy using a new memoir, Call Sign Chaos, to burnish his public reputation as a voice of reason in the age of Trump, he almost single-handedly made \u201clethality\u201d the favorite battle cry of the modern Pentagon. Gunnery Sergeant Hartman may have vowed to transform Marines into \u201ckilling machines\u201d in Full Metal Jacket, but Mattis actually sought to do it.\n\nLethality has been a relatively consistent factor in military doctrines since the Roman Empire swept across the world; it comes, after all, from the Latin l\u0113t\u0101lis, for \u201cmortal\u201d or \u201cdeadly.\u201d But only in the last few years has lethality emerged as the central tenet of U.S. military identity. As the Pentagon reoriented itself away from two decades of counterinsurgency in favor of \u201cgreat power competition\u201d against Russia and China in early 2018, Mattis made the restoration of \u201ca lethal force\u201d a central focus of the country\u2019s updated National Defense Strategy. With U.S. military recruitment rates relatively stagnant, Mattis established a Close Combat Lethality Task Force to squeeze every ounce of deadliness out of American warfighters.\n\nBut for those fighters\u2019 commanders, lethality has doubled as a rhetorical godsend: clinical-sounding, but visceral as well. It connects them to the enduring Mattis brand of bookish military pugnacity. (\u201cBe polite, be professional,\u201d the old Mattisism goes, \u201cbut have a plan to kill everybody you meet.\u201d) Lethality has become the go-to metric for military efficacy, from the Pentagon\u2019s E-ring to every would-be officer\u2019s pre-commissioning professional interviews. In DVIDS, the military\u2019s database of publicly available stories, images, and videos, a search for \u201clethality\u201d returns more than 30,000 hits, nearly half of them from the past year. (A similar search for \u201crestraint\u201d comes up with only 3,000 results, and only about 100 of those come from the past year.)", "description": "As he manicures his political reputation, the Pentagon carries on with the buzzword-heavy culture of killing he gave it.", "authors": ["Jared Keller"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/99de333a6abb7eb7cd1385c5ef6a38c1b96fe34e.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
