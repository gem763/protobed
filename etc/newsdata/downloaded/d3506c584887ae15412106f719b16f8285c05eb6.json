But it\u2019s a particularly miserable time to be a House Republican.\n\nHouse retirements on the GOP side are piling up, a sign that many members aren\u2019t enjoying their time in the minority and aren\u2019t feeling very confident that they\u2019ll seize back power any time soon.\n\nOn Thursday, House Appropriations Committee Chair Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) announced she\u2019d retire after more than three decades in office. She\u2019s just the fourth Democrat who\u2019s decided to leave.\n\nFour times that number of Republicans have decided to retire: 16 are already heading for the exits.\n\nMany House Republicans who\u2019ve decided to leave are experiencing for the first time how much it sucks to be in the powerless minority, or they're older members who\u2019ve already used up their time as chairmen and are wondering why they\u2019re still sticking around.\n\nPresident Trump is an added factor for some, and Republicans\u2019 growing pessimism about taking back the House in 2020 is another reason why they might not be too keen on running again. And some simply don\u2019t want to have to run tough re-election races in districts that are trending away from their party (that applies to a number of the Texas Republicans who\u2019ve decided to leave this year).\n\n\n\nRead: The GOP Is Flipping Out That Will Hurd and Other Moderates Are Suddenly Retiring\n\nRetirements will undoubtedly continue to occur in the coming months \u2014 and possibly in the coming days. The end of the summer recess usually marks the first wave of retirements, with the Thanksgiving and end-of-year holiday breaks bringing two more times for lawmakers to get together with their families and wonder whether it\u2019s worth staying in office.\n\nThis list doesn\u2019t include members who have opted to leave to run for higher office. Candidates in italics represent districts and states that could be potentially competitive in 2020.\n\nRETIREMENTS \u2014 HOUSE\n\nRepublicans\n\nRep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah)\n\nRep.
