The independence camp's unpredictability\n\nThe ruling was more lenient than the prosecutor had sought \u2014 and it angered right-wing commentators for that very reason \u2014 but it nonetheless triggered the ire of the independence camp.\n\nRegional President Quim Torra called the ruling \u201can act of vengeance, not an act of justice.\u201d Protesters took to the streets across Catalonia as soon as the sentence was out. By the evening, roads and railways had been blocked, more than 100 flights to Barcelona had been canceled and the regional police had charged against demonstrators at the airport.\n\nHow it will go from here is less clear.\n\nThe independence movement has been split since 2017, with some advocating further confrontation and others restraint. The proximity of the election and competition between the two main secessionist parties offers incentives for hard-liners, while the ruling means Catalan leaders now know what could happen to them if they push too far.\n\n\u201cThe Generalitat [Catalan government] has two possible paths,\u201d said Andreu Mas-Colell, a Catalan economist and regional minister between 2010 and 2016 under a previous secessionist administration.\n\n\u201cOne is institutional disobedience,\u201d he said, which in his view will end up with Madrid applying direct rule over the region, as it did in 2017 in response to the declaration of independence. Another, he argued, \u201cis the path of declarative disagreements but not of institutional disobedience.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they will dare to do the same [push for independence]. There will be lots of noise, many high-flown statements \u2026 but not an outbreak like the one of 2017,\u201d said Oriol Bartomeus, a politics professor at the Autonomous University of Barcelona.\n\nA more unpredictable factor is whether the public protests trigger a major incident or end up with someone seriously hurt, which could escalate the crisis to a new level, Bartomeus warned.\n\n2. S\u00e1nchez seeks the right balance\n\nWhen he took office last year, S\u00e1nchez adopted a new strategy on Catalonia.\n\nIn contrast to the previous, conservative administration of Mariano Rajoy, S\u00e1nchez promoted dialogue with Catalan authorities. He implemented an aggressive and relatively more sophisticated public relations campaign against them at the international level, while also vowing to uphold the constitution, which says the country cannot be split up.\n\nHow much emphasis there was on dialogue and how much on upholding the law \u2014 in other words, has he preferred the stick or the carrot \u2014 has varied depending on the political situation. On Monday, as in recent months, S\u00e1nchez brandished the stick, warning that his government stands ready to respond to any challenge with \u201cdemocratic firmness, proportionality and unity.\u201d\n\nSpanish right-wing parties traditionally gather support from those fond of national unity, both inside Catalonia and in the rest of Spain, while the Socialists feed from a more diverse crowd and have often relied on a good performance in Catalonia for success at the national level. This makes S\u00e1nchez\u2019s electoral equation even more complex.\n\nMaintaining a balance ahead of the ballot won\u2019t be easy for S\u00e1nchez, with rivals on the right and the left attacking the Spanish leader on Monday, either for having had pro-independence parties as partners in parliament or for being too hard by ruling out a potential pardon for the convicted Catalan leaders \u2014 which S\u00e1nchez seemed to do in his statement on Monday.\n\nThe conservative Popular Party, the far-right Vox and the liberal Ciudadanos attempted to frame the last general election in April as a referendum on S\u00e1nchez\u2019s Catalan policy and painted the PM as a traitor. They failed, with polls indicating that Catalonia wasn\u2019t among the most important worries for citizens. But they will get a second chance in November.\n\nSPAIN NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nS\u00e1nchez will be sure to remind voters that he was fiercely criticized for pushing the state's attorney to accuse Catalan leaders of the lesser charge of sedition during the proceedings, instead of the prosecutor's choice of rebellion. That the court eventually endorsed the attorney's view could play to his advantage.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, if things get out of control in the streets, or if the regional government embarks on an insurrectionist push, S\u00e1nchez will be tempted to prove to the electorate that he\u2019s up to the challenge by using extraordinary measures to impose order, such as direct rule \u2014 and he\u2019s already warned that he\u2019s ready to do just that.\n\n3. Spain\u2019s chronic illness\n\nThe Spanish establishment, including the PM, may claim that the separatists have been defeated and no longer see Catalan independence as an existential threat, but it's not going away.\n\nSupport for independence has remained at around half the population of Catalonia in recent elections.\n\nIn 2017, support for secessionist parties was 47.5 percent in the regional ballot, which took place with independence leaders already jailed awaiting trial, the regional government under the control of Madrid, and images of riot police charging against voters in the October referendum fresh in people's minds.\n\nAs a result, support for independence didn't reach much beyond Catalonia\u2019s traditional nationalist base, but it did result in a new pro-independence regional government in Barcelona.\n\n\u201cI hope the sentence will become a wake-up call for the independence camp and that they see it as an opportunity to turn the page\" \u2014 Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares, top adviser to Pedro S\u00e1nchez\n\nThat balance appears the same and signs are that it will stay that way.\n\nEven though S\u00e1nchez has repeatedly cautioned that the crisis will take \u201cdecades\u201d to solve, he has of late promoted the view that the court ruling should be a turning point. \u201cViolating the constitution isn\u2019t a way to achieve anything,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares, the top international adviser in the PM\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cI hope the sentence will become a wake-up call for the independence camp and that they see it as an opportunity to turn the page,\u201d Albares said.\n\nFor the time being, and barring unexpected moves, the Spanish government will have to continue to handle a regional government with ample powers and the economic means to attempt to portray Spain as a fascist state on the global stage.\n\n\u201cIt is in the common interest that this stays a low-intensity conflict,\u201d said Mas-Colell, the economist. \u201cAny intention to achieve independence unilaterally \u2014 for those who believe it was possible \u2014 well, they\u2019ve already seen it is not.\u201d", "description": "Court decision means Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez will have to navigate a minefield during the election campaign.", "authors": ["Diego Torres", "Guy Hedgecoe"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1181069177-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
