This would take place either next week or as late as the week after \u2013 possibly just two or three days before Britain is due to leave the bloc.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The crucial change is that Ireland is on board for a deal.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

However, the collections of customs would be managed by the UK and Northern Ireland would be part of future UK trade deals.\n\nThe plan is similar to a proposal put forward by Theresa May earlier this year, but the idea was quickly dismissed by the EU, meaning no serious discussions were held on it.\n\nThat means that significant work is now needed to finalise a legal text agreeable to both sides.\n\nA statement from the European Commission described talks over the weekend as \u201cconstructive\u201d but added: \u201cA lot of work remains to be done.\u201d\n\nBriefing EU ambassadors on Sunday night, Michel Barnier, the bloc\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said the latest negotiations had been \u201cdifficult\u201d.\n\nDiscussions between officials are due to continue on Monday, and Brexit is likely to have been top of the agenda for talks between Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Emmanuel Macron, the French president, in Paris on Sunday night.\n\nEarlier in the day, Mr Johnson updated his cabinet during a 30-minute conference call, warning that there was still a \u201csignificant amount of work\u201d to do before a deal can be struck.\n\nAfterwards, a No 10 spokesperson said: \u201cThe prime minister updated cabinet on the current progress being made in ongoing Brexit negotiations, reiterating that a pathway to a deal could be seen but that there is still a significant amount of work to get there and we must remain prepared to leave on 31 October.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister said there was a way forward for a deal that could secure all our interests, respect the Good Friday Agreement, get rid of the backstop and get Brexit done by 31 October so we can push on with domestic agenda.\u201d\n\nEven if Mr Johnson does secure a deal with the EU, he will then have to turn to the tricky task of ensuring it secures parliament\u2019s approval.\n\nThat will involve winning over the DUP, whose deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, warned on Saturday that any proposal which would see Northern Ireland remain in the EU customs union \u201dcannot work\u201d.\n\nIn an attempt to ensure that Tory Brexiteers step into line, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the House of Commons leader and a prominent Eurosceptic, insisted that Mr Johnson could be \u201ctrusted\u201d to deliver Brexit.\n\nWriting in the Sunday Telegraph, he said of the prime minister: \u201cHis charisma and intellect are undoubted, and his electoral appeal has been tested and proved in London. In the final stages of the Brexit negotiation, compromise will inevitably be needed, something even the staunchest Leavers recognise, albeit unwillingly \u2013 but, as a Leaver, Boris can be trusted.\n\n\u201cHe wants to take back control and has dedicated his political career to this noble cause.\u201d\n\nNew analysis by academics at King\u2019s College London found that Mr Johnson\u2019s proposed deal would leave people in the UK \u00a32,000 worse off compared to staying in EU and would deliver a significantly bigger hit to national income than if the UK had left on the terms of Theresa May\u2019s deal.", "description": "The EU has told Boris Johnson he must move \u201cfurther and faster\u201d in last-ditch\u00a0Brexit talks if he is to secure an exit deal and avoid having to ask for another\u00a0extension next weekend.
