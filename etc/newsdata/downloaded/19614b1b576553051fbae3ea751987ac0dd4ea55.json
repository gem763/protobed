Bale has described the meeting in Cardiff as a humongous match with Ryan Giggs\u2019s side fourth in Group E, six points behind leaders Croatia with three games to play.\n\nBale has shaken off a knee issue sustained in Thursday\u2019s 1-1 draw against Slovakia, while Giggs admits a thigh complaint means Aaron Ramsey remains touch-and-go, with the midfielder having not travelled to Bratislava to boost his chances of featuring in Cardiff.\n\nWales\u2019s Kieffer Moore keeps Euro 2020 hopes alive against Slovakia Read more\n\nBale and Modric, who also played alongside each other at Tottenham, have shared 13 trophies across six years together in Madrid but the former has never been on the winning side when they have met at international level, with Croatia winning each of the past three meetings, the most recent of which was a 2-1 victory in Osijek in\n\nJune.\n\n\u201cWhenever we have played we\u2019ve always lost by one goal and it\u2019s always been quite a tight game,\u201d Bale said. \u201cWe know what a great team they are, they had a great World Cup and they have shown year after year how good they actually are. We know it is going to be very tough but I think being at home gives us a little bit more of an advantage and we know the Welsh crowd will be behind us. We\u2019ve played together for a long time in Tottenham and Real Madrid so we know each other quite well. It would be nice to get one over on him finally because they have beaten us a few times in the past.\u201d\n\nBale, as well as midfielder Joe Allen, are one booking away from suspension and the forward acknowledged he needs to be streetwise. \u201cI can\u2019t make too many silly tackles or anything, I have to be mindful of that,\u201d Bale said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to miss any games for Wales and especially at the crunch time of the group. I guess I have to be clever with what I\u2019m doing but maybe I have to expect that someone is going to wind me up to get me suspended.\u201d\n\nThe Wigan striker Kieffer Moore is expected to retain his place in the starting XI, while Giggs said he could freshen things up elsewhere. He will make late calls on Ethan Ampadu and Jonny Williams; both of whom started in Slovakia in midweek, though the pair took part in a light session on Saturday morning.\n\n\u201cThey are a fantastic team with brilliant individuals, but we are a good team as well,\u201d Giggs said. \u201cWe showed that on Thursday night but we need to be better and we need to do it for 90 minutes. Any mistakes, any lapses in concentration, you get punished at this top level against the top teams. It\u2019s not easy but we have got the players to do it and the players are ready.\u201d", "description": "Wales captain Gareth Bale wants to see his Real Madrid teammate on the losing side when Croatia visit Cardiff", "authors": ["Ben Fisher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3702dd724365c43b3a65ffe6a6cd4e5b2d0d13d8/0_106_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=53425f4d379c5102dbe0bc655bd6ed19", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
