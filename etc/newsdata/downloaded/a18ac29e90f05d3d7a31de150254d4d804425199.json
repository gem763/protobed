Roxy Jacenko (pictured) has received several tip-offs overnight concerning the identity of the mystery 'Paddington Pooper'\n\n'This isn't a person with irritable bowel syndrome, this is a person who's getting off on it!' Roxy said on Tuesday, after some of her Instagram followers suggested the woman may have a health problem.\n\nShe added: 'When I Googled it [public defecation], I was shocked how around the world this is a thing.'\n\nRoxy then encouraged the unidentified woman and other poo joggers to find a better hobby, saying: 'Take up swimming, or something? Why do you need to s**t in the street?'\n\nBrazen: Roxy released confronting CCTV footage on Monday night of a female jogger defecating outside her Sweaty Betty PR office on Watson Street in Sydney in broad daylight\n\nLater in the interview, Roxy said she had received several 'leads' as she continues her efforts to identify the woman.\n\n'There's quite a few people who have direct messaged, but that's all I'll say,' she said.\n\nHowever, she clarified that it wasn't a former employee as none of her ex-Sweaty Betty PR staffers resemble the woman in the video.\n\nRoxy added: 'I don't want to embarrass the girl, I just want to know who it is and I want it to stop, as do all of the neighbours on the street.'\n\nGrim: CCTV footage shows the woman running behind a car on Watson Street in Paddington, pulling down her pants and relieving herself on two occasions. Pictured on Thursday\n\nThe 'Paddington pooper' saga began on Monday night, when Roxy shared shocking CCTV footage to Instagram of a female jogger defecating outside her Sweaty Betty PR office in broad daylight.\n\nShe uploaded videos of the woman running behind a car on Watson Street in Paddington, pulling down her pants and relieving herself on two occasions.\n\nThe footage has since been deleted from Roxy's Instagram account.\n\nFurious with the young woman's behaviour, Roxy told Daily Mail Australia she has found faeces on the street for three weeks.\n\nShe said: 'It's disgusting, it's a lovely street lined with heritage terraces, kids playing and riding their bikes. Human faeces shouldn't be on any street. Something needs to be done.'\n\nOutraged! Roxy (pictured) has described the jogger's behaviour as 'disgusting'\n\nWhen asked if she was going to take the matter further, Roxy said on Monday: 'The neighbours and I will all discuss it and make a decision.\n\n'The fact is no one should have to walk through or past human faeces to enter their home or place of work.\n\n'We will be hosing away today's mess tomorrow... I think I would hose her given the chance!'\n\nOn Tuesday, Roxy confirmed police are investigating the matter, telling Daily Mail Australia: 'We have been sent info which will be passed to the police.'\n\nGone! The alarming footage has since been deleted from Roxy's Instagram account\n\nA neighbouring resident, who wished to remain anonymous, told AAP there had been four or five human stools in the same spot over the past three weeks.\n\n'One is fair enough if you're caught short - but four or five I think is too much,' the resident said.\n\n'The poos have come more consistently recently. But I hope the woman isn't shamed as she could possibly have a medical condition.'\n\nRepeat offender? In another video taken on Monday morning, the jogger is seen once again crouching behind a car and relieving herself\n\nHundreds of Roxy's Instagram followers were disgusted by the jogger's actions.\n\n'I don't know whether to laugh or shout in horror,' one person wrote, while another added: 'I think she needs to lay off the pre-workout and protein shakes.'\n\nDefecating in public is a type of offensive conduct in New South Wales and carries a maximum penalty of three months' imprisonment and/or a $660 fine.\n\nSomeone who commits offensive conduct in NSW can also be issued with an on-the-spot fine of $500 by a police officer.\n\nWhile the behaviour shocks many, it isn't the first time someone has taken to public streets to defecate.\n\nIn May last year, Brisbane residents complained after a morning runner had relieved himself on a public pathway leading to an apartment block for over a year.\n\nResidents of the unit block came together to find the culprit, with a photographer waiting outside to catch him in the middle of his morning ritual.\n\nThe bizarre operation lead to the arrest of 64-year-old corporate executive Andrew Macintosh, who was caught defecating at least 30 times within a year.", "description": "Roxy Jacenko\u00a0has received several tip-offs overnight concerning the identity of the mystery 'Paddington Pooper'.", "authors": ["Jo Scrimshire", "Lauren Ferri For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/22/19711404-0-image-a-40_1571087949384.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
