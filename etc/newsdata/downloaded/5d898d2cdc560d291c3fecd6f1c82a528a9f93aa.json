(Logan Cyrus/Bloomberg).\n\nThe proportion of Americans without health insurance grew significantly last year for the first time this decade, even as the economy\u2019s strength pushed down the poverty level to its lowest point since 2001, according to federal data released Tuesday.\n\nThe findings that 27.5 million U.S. resident lacked coverage in 2018, based on a large U.S. Census Bureau survey, reverse the trend that began when the Affordable Care Act expanded opportunities for poor and some middle-income people to get insurance.\n\nTaken together, the census numbers paint a portrait of an economy pulled in different directions, with the falling poverty rate coinciding with high inequality and the growing cadre of people at financial risk because they do not have health coverage.\n\nAs more Americans found jobs, the poverty rate fell last year to its lowest level since 2001 and middle-class income inched marginally higher. Median U.S. income \u2014 the point at which half of U.S. families more and half earn less \u2014 topped $63,000 for the first time, although it was roughly the same level as it was 20 years ago, after adjusting for inflation.\n\n[Six in 10 Americans expect a recession in next year, WaPo-ABC poll finds]\n\n\u201cMedian household income today is right where it was in 1999. We\u2019ve seen two decades with no progress for the middle class,\u201d said University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers. \u201cThe economy is producing more than before, but the gains aren\u2019t being shared equally.\u201d\n\nIncomes rose substantially in big cities last year but declined in smaller ones. And poverty rose for adults over 25 without high school diplomas.\n\n\u201cSome of the folks who fueled the Trump candidacy and presidency still aren\u2019t doing great,\u201d said Matt Weidinger, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who watches poverty trends closely.\n\nWith health care already a central issue in the 2020 presidential campaigns and a prime voter concern, meanwhile, the fresh evidence that insurance is slipping further out of Americans\u2019 reach is virtually certain to escalate partisan warring about Americans\u2019 access to affordable coverage.\n\nLast year was the first time since 2009 that both the number and the proportion of Americans without coverage rose significantly from the year before.\n\nThe change was driven primarily by a decrease in public insurance for the poor, with enrollment in Medicaid dropping by 0.7 percent, the data show. The uninsured rate spiked especially among adults who are Hispanic and foreign-born. Coverage also dwindled among children who are Hispanic and naturalized citizens.\n\n[For the first time, most new working-age hires in the U.S. are people of color]\n\nHealth policy experts interpreted those patterns as evidence of a chilling effect from the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to restrict several forms of public assistance, including Medicaid, for immigrants seeking to remain in the United States. In addition, some state have been clamping down on eligibility rules for Medicaid.\n\n\u201cThe word has gone out if you use Medicaid, then you are a public charge and you\u2019re liable not to get a green card,\u201d said Sara Rosenbaum, a George Washington University health law and policy professor, who called the patterns of health coverage for immigrant children \u201calarm bell territory.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are not only not enrolling, they are coming in [to Medicaid offices} and asking to be disenrolled.\u201d Rosenbaum said.\n\nThe Trump administration cheered the news that the official U.S. poverty rate fell to 11.8 percent last year (38.1 million people), the lowest since 11.7 percent in 2001, as a sign the president\u2019s policies are working to boost the economy. Businesses have been hiring minority and low-skilled workers at unusually high rates lately, helping give jobs and opportunities to Americans who struggled for years to get a chance.\n\n\u201cEmployment is the best way out of poverty,\u201d said Tomas Philipson, acting head of Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s critics wrongly assert that government programs and handouts are the only way to lift people out of poverty, but today\u2019s data tells a different story.\u201d\n\nThe poverty rate for adults who work full-time all year round is 2.3 percent, much lower than the poverty rate for people who do not work, which is nearly 30 percent.\n\nThe fall in the U.S. poverty rate has been driven largely by people moving from part-time to full-time work, helping boost incomes. Last year alone, more than 2 million people found full-time jobs, the Census report said.\n\n\u201cWe have found quite a big increase in full-time, year-round work that would tend to bring up incomes for working people,\u201d said Trudi Renwick, an assistant division chief at the Census Bureau.\n\nBut income inequality also remains near the highest levels of the past half century, according to census data. Recent wage gains by lower-income workers who have found jobs and benefited from minimum wage increases in many states have not been enough to close the long-running trend of the wealthy seeing far larger income gains than the middle or lower classes.\n\nIncomes for families earning about $15,000 or less have fallen since 2007, according to the latest Census data, while incomes households bring in about $250,000 a year have grown more than 15 percent.\n\n[\u2018UVA has ruined us\u2019: Health system sues thousands of patients, seizing paychecks and putting liens on homes]\n\nThe Census\u2019 yearly data on health insurance, meanwhile, has been scrutinized by both supporters and opponents of the ACA as evidence of how well the law is working. Expanding insurance access was a main goal of the ACA, the statute forged by Democrats nearly a decade ago that has reshaped much of the health care system. President Trump and other Republicans contend the law is fatally flawed, while Democrats maintain it has been undermined by recent GOP policies.\n\nThe availability of insurance is influenced by a variety of factors, including economic conditions, because most insured residents get coverage through an employer. But as Trump works to dismantle the law and liberal Democratic candidates seek to replace it with a government-financed health-care system, both sides can find ammunition for their interpretation of why the nation\u2019s uninsured rate has started rising again.\n\nRepublicans point to how, as premiums escalate, fewer people buy health plans through the ACA\u2019s marketplaces unless they qualify for federal subsidies. Democrats point to how major tax changes, adopted by a Republican Congress at the end of 2017, eliminated the financial penalty for those who violate the ACA\u2019s requirement that most Americans carry health insurance \u2014 removing one motivation to stay insured.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) a candidate who has long called for \u201cMedicare-for-all,\u201d tweeted on Tuesday, \u201cMr. Trump lied. He promised to strengthen health care \u2014 instead, he has done everything he can to sabotage the Affordable Care Act. The result: Nearly two million people joined the ranks of the uninsured last year.\u201d\n\nThe new figures for 2018 show that the uninsured rate increased to 8.5 percent of the population from 7.9 percent the year before. In contrast, some 9 million Americans gained coverage between 2013 and 2014, the year that Medicaid expanded in many states and ACA insurance marketplaces opened for individuals and families unable to get affordable health plans through work.\n\nTuesday\u2019s data make clear that the contraction of insurance has been broad. Around the country, insurance coverage worsened in eight states and improved in three states. For the first time, the Census Bureau broke out the proportion of Americans buying health plans through the health law\u2019s insurance marketplaces. They show that 3.3 percent of people last year got their coverage through such a marketplace. The breakout reinforces how the ACA\u2019s health plans, while attracting considerable political attention, account for only a fraction of the nation\u2019s health insurance.\n\nWhile Medicaid enrollment fell, the proportion of Americans covered through employer-based insurance did not change significantly. Meanwhile, enrollment in Medicare, the program for elderly and disabled people, grew slightly \u2014 probably as a result of the nation\u2019s expanding population of older residents, Census officials said in releasing the data.\n\nThe Bureau\u2019s Current Population Survey is widely regarded as the most reliable portrayal of health insurance in the United States, but there have been other clues the ranks of the uninsured are swelling. In July, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued findings from the National Health Interview Survey that the number of Americans uninsured at the same they were asked increased from 28.9 million in 2017 to 30 million last year.\n\nThe Census\u2019s CPS counts people as uninsured if they lacked coverage throughout the year.\n\nRelated:\n\nVoters have big health-care worries, but not the ones Democrats are talking about\n\nPoor and middle-class Americans are much less likely to survive into their 70s than the rich\n\nOnce considered a far-left idea, \u2018public option\u2019 insurance swerves into the mainstream\n\nThe Trump v.
