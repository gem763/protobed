These typically aim to own a company for a few years then sell it at a profit.\n\nBefore the October 29 deadline, Advent could submit a range of commitments around jobs or keeping Cobham\u2019s research and technology in the UK.\n\nIt could also offer undertakings about what will happen if it sells the company in the future.\n\nCobham said last night that it is assisting the CMA and providing all information required.\n\nAdvent said it is committed to being a \u2018responsible custodian\u2019 of the company.", "description": "They have criticised the 165p-per-share offer from Advent International for posing a threat to the UK's space sector and understating Cobham's importance to the UK defence industry.", "authors": ["Francesca Washtell For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
