Not one of these five are the real Kylie Jenner.\n\nIn fact the people in the picture are her pals, Olivia O\u2019Brien in the purple, a pal called Kelsey in the pink, Stassie in black, Nikita Dragun in green and Sydney Carlson in the blue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKylie joined Stassie in wearing the classic black outfit, and the pair shared photos of the two of them together on Instagram too.\n\nIt was Alyssa Vingan Klein, a NYLON magazine editor, who first spotted that all of Kylie\u2019s besties were basically morphing into her, tweeting: \u2018When did all of K*lie J*nner\u2019s friends become her clones?\u2019\n\nWhen did all of K*lie J*nner\u2019s friends become her clones? pic.twitter.com/UuOAucy6o3 \u2014 Alyssa Vingan Klein (@alyssavingan) October 30, 2019\n\nAlso in attendance at the party was Paris Hilton, who decided not to be a bunny and went for a sailor outfit instead.\n\nNo, we\u2019re not sure what that has to do with Playboy either\u2026\n\nKylie matched her bestie Stassie with a black bodysuit (Picture: Instagram)\n\nThe party was hosted by Stassie and Kelsey, who even posed for a mock Playboy cover as the invite for their guests.\n\nKylie went the whole hog in the classic corseted black strapless bodysuit with black tights, bunny ears and white collar and cuffs.\n\nShe told her followers: \u2018stas said I\u2019m having a playboy party.. pull up\u2019.\n\nWhile we wish we could have been a fly on the wall at this epic party, the sight of six Kylie Jenners in the same room could get a little confusing after a couple of \u2018Stassiebunny\u2019 cocktails.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
