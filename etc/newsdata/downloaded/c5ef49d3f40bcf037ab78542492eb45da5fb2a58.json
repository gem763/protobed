We do work with some satellite companies to provide connectivity where the LTE network stops,\" Loots said.\n\n\"We've done some work also with regards to satellite-based LTE networks ... so we'll always be looking for complimentary ways just to solve that problem.\"\n\nLoots added that the majority of use cases were where the IoT network was able to provide coverage.\n\nLast month, Optus Business signed an agreement with IoT satellite startup Myriota to add mobile connectivity to Myriota's plans.\n\nOptus Business will also offer the plans to its customers.\n\n\"Previously, satellite connectivity has not been available or affordable for businesses with remote assets, but nanosatellites are providing a more attainable and affordable solution,\" Myriota CEO and co-founder Dr Alex Grant said at the time.\n\n\"By combining Optus' national networks with our nanosatellite capability, we are able to offer a truly holistic IoT solution and help solve connectivity issues being faced in regional Australia.\"\n\nDisclosure: Chris Duckett travelled to Telstra Vantage as a guest of Telstra\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nTelstra deploys private LTE network in PNG volcanic crater gold mine\n\nAll production vehicles are hooked up to a private 4G network for Newcrest Mining.\n\n3 main inhibitors to IoT adoption in the enterprise (TechRepublic)\n\nVMware's Internet of Things CTO discusses the three main concerns an enterprise should consider before heading down an IoT path.\n\nTelstra ditches unlimited data in mobile plan shake-up\n\nUnlimited data axed as telco switches to monthly commitments for connectivity.\n\nTelstra blames NBN for H1 profit plummeting by AU$500 million\n\nTelstra gained mobile customers, but lost revenue due to the migration of customers to the NBN.\n\nTelstra and Ericsson expand NB-IoT range out to 100km\n\nUsing Ericsson software, NB-IoT extended range cells can now reach 100km away, which Telstra said is part of its efforts to connect regional and rural areas of the nation.", "description": "An initial 6.5 kilometre private network will be created for South32's Cannington mine.", "authors": ["Chris Duckett"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/02/01/64e00ac7-0bdc-45db-817c-e90eb8f1d7d5/thumbnail/770x578/afbf5bc8477ad356107a981c56f878d5/mine.jpg"}
