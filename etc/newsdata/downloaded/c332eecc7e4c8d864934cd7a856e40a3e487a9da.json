(Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe free throw line proved to be the difference between sweet relief and deep embarrassment.\n\nTeam USA escaped Turkey, 93-92, in overtime of a FIBA World Cup group play game on Tuesday, barely keeping alive a 13-year undefeated streak at major international tournaments.\n\nDespite a frantic endgame that again raised doubts about Team USA\u2019s ability in clutch situations, the Americans survived in front of a pro-Turkey crowd in Shanghai by cashing in at the line.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks forward Khris Middleton delivered two game-clinching free throws with 2.1 seconds remaining in overtime. The extra period was made possible by Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum, who hit two of his three free throws after being fouled on a three-point attempt with 0.1 seconds remaining in regulation. Middleton finished with a team-high 15 points, while Tatum added 11.\n\nTurkey, meanwhile, saw its valiant upset bid die at the stripe. Holding a 92-91 lead with less than 20 seconds left in overtime, Cedi Osman and Dogus Balbay combined to miss four straight free throws to set up Middleton\u2019s heroics.\n\nThe Turks were regarded as Team USA\u2019s toughest competition in the first round of the tournament, thanks to NBA talents including Ersan Ilyasova, Osman, Furkan Korkmaz and Semih Erden. Ilyasova led Turkey with a game-high 23 points, including a tip-in with 12.3 seconds left in regulation that could have been the game-winner.\n\nThe Americans, who are playing without any A-list NBA talents in China, have not lost at a major international tournament since Sept. 1, 2006, when they fell to Greece in the semifinals of the FIBA World Championships. They have now won 45 consecutive games in the Olympics and FIBA World tournaments. A loss to Turkey would not have eliminated Team USA, but it could have cost them the top seed in their opening round group and made their path to gold more difficult.\n\nThis version of Team USA has been forced to confront its mortality far earlier than previous, star-studded renditions. Team USA is accustomed to breezing through opening-round games with huge blowouts; it has not lost an opening-round game in a FIBA World tournament since 1998 or in any major international event since the 2004 Olympics. Both of those events saw the Americans settle for bronze, and they are remembered as shameful lows in the program\u2019s illustrious history.\n\nFlaws abound for Coach Gregg Popovich\u2019s current team, which has struggled with its late-game decision-making and hasn\u2019t intimidated its international competition. Team USA wasted possessions and bogged down in choppy half-court sequences on offense against Turkey, while also missing key rotations and sacrificing untimely offensive rebounds on the other end.\n\nMuch like during its recent exhibition loss to Australia, Team USA played scattered basketball down the stretch against Turkey. Boston Celtics guard Kemba Walker made a pair of crucial baskets in overtime, but an offensive goaltending call on Donovan Mitchell, an unsportsmanlike foul call on Joe Harris and a turnover by Myles Turner combined to push Team USA to the brink.\n\nThe late-game complications also included a left ankle sprain for Tatum, who suffered the injury while setting up Middleton in transition on the game-deciding sequence. After limping off the court, Tatum downplayed the severity of the injury to reporters. His status will be reevaluated on Wednesday.\n\nIn its worst moments, Team USA appears to be searching for a savior who isn\u2019t present and isn\u2019t coming. Walker played with greater command and urgency against Turkey than he did late against Australia, a decisive development that must continue against the tournament\u2019s top competition. As the most proven backcourt star on a roster with few alpha scoring options, Walker\u2019s impact will be magnified in every close game that Team USA plays.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the ominous rub to the thrilling victory: Team USA\u2019s path to gold has just begun, and it will get considerably tougher. While both Australia and Turkey possess quality NBA players, the top competition is still on the horizon and the crowds rooting for an upset will likely only get louder.\n\nFor perspective, Turkey was ranked just 17th in the world entering the World Cup. Four teams that are ranked in the top-five \u2014 Serbia, Spain, France and Argentina \u2014 have all posted higher point differentials than Team USA so far in China. Remarkably, the Serbians won their first two games by an average of 52.5 points, even though star center Nikola Jokic rested for roughly half of each game.\n\nThe good news for Team USA is that its final opening round game on Thursday comes against an overmatched Japan. Popovich could theoretically rest Tatum and go deep into his bench as he prepares for second-round play, which begins Saturday and is expected to include a showdown with Greece and reigning NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo. If the hard-fought contest with Turkey is any indication, though, there will be few gimmes from that point forward.\n\nRead more:\n\nFive burning questions for USA Basketball as the FIBA World Cup gets underway\n\nWith role in Wizards\u2019 front office, Antawn Jamison reinvents himself once again\n\nThe Dwight Howard-Lakers reunion is a double-sided self-delusion\n\nSign up for our weekly NBA newsletter to get the best basketball coverage in your inbox", "description": "A 93-92 win keeps alive a 13-year undefeated streak at major international tournaments, but Team USA is accustomed to breezing through opening-round games with huge blowouts.", "authors": ["Ben Golliver", "Nba Reporter", "September At Pm", "Ben Golliver Joined The Washington Post As The National Nba Writer In Previously", "He Was A Senior Writer At Sports Illustrated Covering The Nba.
