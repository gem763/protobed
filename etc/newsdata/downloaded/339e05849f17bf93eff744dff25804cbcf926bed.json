Chile's peso slumped 2% and was on course to log its biggest one-day drop in more than 6 years, while stocks sank almost 3% in what could be their worst day in two years. The military was put in charge of security in Santiago after youth protests against fare hikes on public transport implemented earlier this month turned to vandalism and arson. President Sebastian Pinera later extended emergency rule to cities to the north and south of the capital. \"The events were entirely unexpected and should lead to a weaker CLP in the near term,\" analysts at Citigroup wrote in a note. \"We don't expect the weakness to sustain unless the situation deteriorates much further.\" While Citi Economics differs from market expectations of a cut in interest rates by the central bank later this week, the risk of one has certainly increased after the unrest, they said. Workers at BHP's Escondida copper mine - the world's largest - said they would hold a day-long strike on Tuesday in a show of solidarity. Copper prices shot up on the London Metals exchange. Brazil's real slipped half a percent with the final Senate vote on the government's pension reform bill expected to take place on Tuesday. The reform is seen as crucial to reducing Brazil's primary deficit and spurring a recovery in the sluggish economy. If the bill wins Tuesday's vote, that will clear the way to passing the bill into law. The real has seen volatility for months as the bill made its way through houses of parliament after President Jair Bolsonaro's administration introduced it upon taking office in January. Lower oil prices pressured crude exporter Colombia's currency, while Mexico's peso fell 0.1% but hovered near 2-1/2 month highs as broader market sentiment was buoyed by trade optimism. Over the weekend, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said Beijing will work with Washington to address each other's concerns on trade issues. Most stocks in the region inched higher, tracking a rise on Wall Street. Yduqs was the biggest gainer on Brazil's benchmark index after the education company said it bought Adtalem Global Education Inc's local assets for 1.92 billion reais ($467 million).
