According to local reports, the arrested was tied to $350 million worth of funds previously seized by the Polish Ministry of Justice from Crypto Capital\u2019s Polish subsidiary, Crypto Sp. z. oo.\n\nCrypto Capital is a Panama-based firm that the U.S. Department of Justice claims provided shadow banking services to several cryptocurrency exchanges, including Bitfinex, Binance, Cex.io, Coinapult and QuadrigaCX.\n\nOn Oct. 25, Stuart Hoegner, general counsel to Bitfinex, issued a statement responding to Lee\u2019s arrest asserting that Bitfinex was the victim of fraud perpetrated by Crypto Capital. The statement also rejected accusations that proceeds from narcotics allegedly laundered by Crypto Capital were associated with the exchange.\n\nRelations deteriorate between Bitfinex and Crypto Capital\n\nCrypto Capital\u2019s partnership with Bitfinex has garnered significant scrutiny in recent months, with the exchange claiming that the liquidity issues had been triggered by an inability to access $880 million worth of its funds that were being held by Crypto Capital.\n\nLast week, Bitfinex filed with a California court to subpoena the former vice president of TCA Bancorp, Rondell Clyde Monroe, with the exchange asserting that Monroe held information relating to its funds held by Crypto Capital.\n\nBitfinex claims that its partnership with Crypto Capital began to deteriorate in April of last year, following reports indicating that Polish authorities had seized roughly $350 million from an account belonging to Crypto Capital subsidiary Crypto Sp. z. oo. with Bank Sp\u00f3\u0142dzielczy w Skierniewicach.\n\nBitfinex subpoenas Crypto Capital representative\n\nIn the subpoena, Bitfinex alleged that TCA Bancorp provided banking services to Crypto Capital, asserting that the firm had \u201cused one or more accounts held at TCA Bancorp to facilitate the transfer of funds.\u201d\n\nBitfinex holds that in August 2018, Crypto Capital informed the exchange that approximately $500 million of Bitfinex\u2019s funds were being \u201cheld up\u201d by authorities in Poland and Portugal. When pressed to provide evidence of the frozen funds, Bitfinex was issued a reference letter signed by Monroe stating that more than $300 million worth of Bitfinex\u2019s funds were being held with TCA Bancorp by Global Trade Solutions AG, operating as Crypto Capital.\n\nThe filing requested the court for permission to accept Monroe\u2019s deposition testimony. Bitfinex believes that Monroe possesses key information relating to the funds that were in the custody of Crypto Capital, with the exchange also seeking to obtain communications between Monroe and Crypto Capital.\n\nAdditionally, Bitfinex sought documentation of Monroe\u2019s communications with Yosef and his sister Ravid Yosef, as well as Global Trade Solutions shareholder Reginald Fowler and his son Trent Fowler. Both Reginald Fowler and Ravid Yosef have been indicted by the Department of Justice for alleged bank fraud relating to a cryptocurrency exchange intermediary.\n\nBitfinex is also the subject of an ongoing investigation by the New York State Office of the Attorney General for failing to disclose that it was unable to access the $880 million in funds and that it had used a loan from sister company Tether to both continue operating and conceal the losses.\n\nCrypto Capital\u2019s past\n\nCrypto Capital has been in operation since 2013, with Braveno\u2019s Mathias Gr\u00f8nneb\u00e6k claiming that Reddit user u/bitfan2013 was the firm\u2019s founder. In May 2013, u/bitfan2013 posted to the r/Bitcoin subreddit, probing the community sentiment regarding a proposed bank that would comprise a means to convert between BTC and fiat currency, in addition to providing services to companies operating in the crypto sector.\n\nThe poster asserted that his family and he sat on the board of directors for four \u201csmall \u2013 medium sized private banks\u201d in Panama. The following week, u/bitfan2013 announced that they had decided to \u201coffer private international banking to bitcoin customers, merchants and traders.\u201d\n\nIn June 2013, Crypto Capital (then operating under the name Crypto Financial) launched, and then conducted what it called an initial public offering to raise 30,000 BTC through Panama-based Havelock Investments in August 2013. By 2015, Crypto Capital had attracted several notable exchanges as clients, providing services to Bitfinex and Coinapult, among others.\n\nBitfinex depended on Crypto Capital amid banking difficulties\n\nBitfinex\u2019s affiliation with Crypto Capital became the subject of scrutiny in 2017, with the exchange directing its customers to deposit funds to accounts held by Crypto Capital subsidiaries following the Wells Fargo termination of banking services to Bitfinex via its Taiwanese partners in March 2017.\n\nStuart Hoegner, general counsel for Bitfinex and Tether, stated that the exchange expanded the number of accounts held with Crypto Capital throughout 2017 and 2018, as the platform became increasingly reliant on Crypto Capital for the processing of fiat services.\n\nDuring November 2017, Bitfinex began directing customers to deposit funds into Crypto Sp. z. oo.\u2019s account with Bank Sp\u00f3\u0142dzielczy w Skierniewicach in Poland. The director of both Crypto Capital and Crypto Sp. z. oo. is Ivan Manuel Molina Lee, a Panamanian who appears to have acted as a nominee director for many Panama-based companies.\n\nCrypto Capital accounts seized in April 2018\n\nIn April 2018, Polish authorities seized $371 million from an account held by Crypto Sp. z. oo. with Bank Sp\u00f3\u0142dzielczy w Skierniewicach in Poland for alleged ties to Colombian cartel operations.\n\nAt the time, an individual posting on the Bitcoin.pl forum claimed to have been questioned by Polish police \u201cregarding the case of Crypto Sp. z. oo.\u201d as a result of having previously received funds from Bitfinex via the intermediary.\n\nBitfinex denied the alleged ties to the accounts seized and claimed that its operations were \u201cunaffected\u201d by the events. Crypto Capital accounts that had been operated on behalf of the now-defunct website Backpage were also seized in a sex-trafficing bust by authorities in April 2018.\n\nCrypto Capital rebrands to Global Trade Solutions\n\nAfter partnering with ING, Bitfinex recommenced directing customers to deposit fiat using accounts held by Crypto Capital subsidiaries, including the Swiss-based Global Trade Solutions via Portuguese bank Caixa Geral de Depositos in February 2018.\n\nBy the third quarter of 2018, accounts held by Global Trade Solutions were used to facilitate fiat transactions for Bitfinex via multiple U.S. banks, including Citibank, HSBC and Enterprise Bank & Trust.\n\nIn June 2018, Crypto Capital dissolved and liquidated itself, and has since been operated by Global Trade Solutions. Amid the restructuring, it became apparent that Crypto Capital had purchased a software engineering firm that was founded in 2001, which is presumed to be the basis for the \u201c2001\u201d branded on Global Trade Solutions\u2019 logo featured on its website.\n\nTensions rise between Bitfinex and Crypto Capital\n\nIn chat logs documenting communications between Bitfinex executive \u201cMerlin\u201d and Crypto Capital\u2019s \u201cOz\u201d that were provided to the New York State Office of the Attorney General for its investigations, Bitfinex appears to have desperately sought to access its funds held by Crypto Capital from August 2018 onward.\n\nOn Aug. 15, 2018, Merlin stated: \u201cHey Oz, sorry to bother you every day, is there any way to move at least 100M [...] ? We are seeing massive withdrawals and we are not able to face them anymore unless we can transfer some money out of Cryptocapital.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 15, 2018, Merlin pleaded with Crypto Capital to provide Bitfinex with funds, warning that \u201ctoo many withdrawals\u201d were \u201cwaiting for a long time,\u201d and that a failure to respond \u201ccould be extremely dangerous for [...] the entire crypto community,\u201d adding, \u201cBTC could tank to below 1k if we don\u2019t act quickly.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 17, Merlin stated that Bitfinex \u201curgently\u201d needed $100 million in \u201ceither Tethers or USD\u201d within one week. The next day, Merlin told Crypto Capital: \u201cToo much money is trapped with you and we are currently walking on a very thin crust of ice.\u201d\n\nBitfinex among several parties affected\n\nCrypto Capital\u2019s fallout affected a number of cryptocurrency exchanges. In December 2018, Crypto Capital customer Coinapult announced that it was \u201cexperiencing issues\u201d and that \u201cwithdrawals may take longer than usual.\u201d The statement was the last made by the company, and it is currently unclear whether or not the exchange is still operational.\n\nThe now-defunct QuadrigaCX was also a client of Crypto Capital, with the exchange losing access to $190 million of its customers\u2019 funds. Before the exchange\u2019s collapse, Hanin asserted that the platform\u2019s transactions were not being processed by Crypto Capital due to issues with its Taiwanese banking partner.\n\nIn May of this year, Minnesota Vikings\u2019 investor and football entrepreneur Reginald Fowler was charged alongside Global Trade Solutions shareholder Ravid Yosef for operating an unlicensed money transmitting business on behalf of cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Fowler and Yosef have access to $345 million held in various international bank accounts, including accounts owned by Global Trade Solutions. Crypto Capital had also processed transfers on behalf of Bitfinex using Portuguese companies co-owned by Fowler in February 2018.", "description": "A look at the history of the mysterious firm Crypto Capital and its ties to Bitfinex as court cases brew", "authors": ["Samuel Haig"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8wZTRmYjA0NjZiMWY0N2I1NDEyZjZjY2I5NThmZjgwNC5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
