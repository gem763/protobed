clock change is brought into force after the transition period, Britain will be able to decide whether or not to keep current daylight saving times. Less certain is how it will affect the Northern Irish border.\n\nQuizzed during a House of Lords sub-committee, Kelly Tolhurst, a minister at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), said the EU\u2019s plans were centred on the \u201charmonisation of the single market\u201d.\n\nShe insisted the UK government was strongly opposed to the measures, and said she hoped the proposals to scrap daylight saving time are \u201ckicked into the long-grass\u201d.\n\nLord Lansley, a peer on the EU internal market sub-committee, however, raised the prospect of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland aligning if the EU directive is eventually brought into force.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf the legal basis is a single market measure, and if the protocol as published pursues alignment between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland on single market measures and this directive is brought into force, the government\u2019s expectation is that there would be alignment between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The plans must receive a qualified majority of the EU 27.", "description": "A \u201ctime border\u201d between Northern Ireland and Great Britain could exist after Brexit due to EU proposals to end seasonal clock changes, a government minister has admitted.
