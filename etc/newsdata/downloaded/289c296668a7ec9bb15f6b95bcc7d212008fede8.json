He said police recovered a metal pipe that was still in the suspect\u2019s hands when he was arrested after fleeing the scene of the last attack.\n\nHe was described as wearing a black jacket and black pants that helped police find him quickly and arrest him on a nearby street.\n\nThe victims were attacked in three different locations. The first died of blunt trauma to the head. A second man was attacked nearby but survived. He was taken to New York-Presbyterian Lower Manhattan Hospital in critical condition.\n\nThe other three victims, attacked about a block away, also died of trauma to the head.\n\nThe New York Post published photos of two of the victims under a white sheet, one slumped in a blood-spattered doorway. The other lay under a sheet on the sidewalk. The identities of the victims have not been released.\n\nBaldassano said police were searching the neighborhood street by street Saturday morning for any other possible victims.\n\nNew York City\u2019s homeless population has grown in recent years, to a great extent because of the lack of affordable housing.\n\nThe killings started on The Bowery, which cuts through Chinatown and has for decades been known as New York\u2019s skid row, inhabited by homeless addicts and alcoholics.\n\nDuring the day, the neighborhood is bustling with small businesses and street vendors offering discount goods, its sidewalks packed with pedestrians.\n\nLate at night, when the shops close, it turns into a quiet, desolate neighborhood that was the setting for Saturday\u2019s attacks.", "description": "A homeless man wielding a metal pipe killed four other homeless people and left another in critical condition, according to police.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d98b1b6210000c102a9e4d2.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
