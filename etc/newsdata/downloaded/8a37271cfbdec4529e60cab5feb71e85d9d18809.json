You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBEWARE \u2013 major spoilers for the ending of LOST follows. If you haven\u2019t seen, we suggest you watch right away while following along with podcast \u2018The Lost Boys\u2019.\n\nThe final ever scene of Lost is intercut between events on the island and an alternate timeline known as the flashsideways \u2013 scenes that replace the flashbacks and flashforwards for the entire final season.\n\nThese flashsideways scenes come after Juliet (Elizabeth Mitchell), stuck in the 1970s, detonates a hydrogen bomb in the closing moments of season five in an attempt to prevent the hatch from ever being built. The logic is that, should the hatch never be created, Oceanic Flight 815 will never crash on the island. The flashsideways show what would have happened had the plane landed safely in Los Angeles.\n\nAll season long, viewers see the characters rubbing shoulders with one another in LA, unaware of the events of the past five seasons.\n\nEventually, these characters are drawn together and they begin to recall their time on the island, which leads to the final scene\u2019s revelation: they are dead in the flashsideways, which are essentially a netherworld the survivors created in order to congregate so they can move on to \u201cwhatever comes next\u201d together.\n\nSo, to clear up the confusion: in the flashsideways scenes, these characters are dead. But no, they were not dead all along after their plane crashed.\n\nThe flashsideways scenes depict an afterlife that the characters constructed for themselves due to the fact that their time on the island \u2013 which was completely real from start to end \u2013 was the most important part of their respective lives.\n\nThe characters present in that final church scene are characters both dead and alive in island time, meaning several characters (including Kate, Sawyer and Claire) went on to live a full life beyond the series finale.\n\nThese flashsideways present a purgatory-of-sorts, where these characters come to when they eventually do die whenever that may be. When broken down, it\u2019s a beautiful and reassuring depiction of the afterlife.\n\nThe plane crash, the smoke monster, the hatch, the island \u2013 it was all real.\n\nOf course, it almost all ended rather differently...\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
