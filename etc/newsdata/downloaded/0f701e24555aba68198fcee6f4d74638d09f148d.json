The tech giant also said that Live Action, its links and Rose's page would have reduced distribution and other restrictions for repeatedly sharing false news.\n\nOne video, titled \u201cThe Pro-Life Reply to \u2018Abortion Can Be Medically Necessary,\u2019\u201d featured neonatologist Dr. Kendra Kolb. The second video, titled \"Abortion is NEVER Medically Necessary,\" featured a speech given by Rose. Live Action and Rose's Facebook page reach more than 3 million followers combined.\n\nIS FACEBOOK GETTING RID OF 'LIKES'?\n\nACTIVISTS BLAST BEZOS FOR SAYING AMAZON IS WRITING ITS OWN FACIAL RECOGNITION LAWS\n\nFacebook removed the strikes against Live Action two weeks ago while the fact-checking organization, known as Science Feedback, conducted an internal review of what took place.\n\n\u201cScience Feedback\u2019s conclusion appears sound and fair, based on the best evidence. Their fact-check is an accurate attempt to inform readers on the veracity of a claim and strictly adheres to their scientific fact-checking methodology,\" Sarphan Uzunoglu, an assistant professor of multimedia journalism at Lebanese American University who hasn't taken advocacy positions on abortion, said in a statement published by Poynter Institute, a prominent journalism organization.\n\nUzunoglu examined the process by which the claim was selected for review and did the same for the most recent 10 fact-checks done by Science Feedback. Based on his work, and Science Feedback's explanation of the editorial processes involved in published the fact-check, the International Fact-Checking Network came to the following conclusions:\n\n\"The findings of Science Feedback\u2019s fact-check were based on publicly available scientific evidence and as not the result of any bias. The claim that \u201cabortion is never medically necessary\u201d is false and inaccurate. The process used by Science Feedback to select the original claim to review was sound and not the result of any systemic bias, and a review of the 10 last fact-checks indicates no systemic bias in the selection of claims to check. The failure to declare to their readers that two individuals who assisted Science Feedback, not in writing the fact-check but in reviewing the evidence, had positions within advocacy organizations, and the failure to clarify their role to readers, fell short of the standards required of IFCN signatories. This has been communicated to Science Feedback.\"\n\nMATCH.COM PROFITED OFF OF ROMANCE SCAMMERS, FTC CLAIMS\n\nRose is demanding that Facebook reform its fact-checking process immediately.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling only confirms that the justification for banning our views is a corrupt \u2018fact-checking\u2019 system masquerading as independent when really it is the enemy of fairness and free speech,\" Rose said.\n\nIn a meeting with Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apparently said his company's handling of the entire controversy was \"clearly biased.\"\n\nFox News reached out to Facebook for comment.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News' James Rogers and Judson Berger contributed to this report.", "description": "Pro-life group Live Action slammed Facebook's fact-checking system after an investigation into fact-checker Science Feedback found its conclusions to be fair and accurate.", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/facebook-logo-getty-images.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
