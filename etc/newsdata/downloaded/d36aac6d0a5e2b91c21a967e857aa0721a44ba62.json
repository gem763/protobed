If Washington goes with three active running backs, the newly arrived Wendell Smallwood may get the nod ahead of Peterson because Smallwood is a good special teams player. Only if four running backs are active would Peterson definitely be one of them.\n\nIn 2017, Peterson signed with the Saints but didn\u2019t last long in New Orleans after expressing frustration with a lack of playing time. Whether the same thing happens in Washington remains to be seen, but it sounds like Peterson won\u2019t get many carries \u2014 and may not play at all.", "description": "Washington running back Adrian Peterson may not play in Sunday's season opener in Philadelphia.
