REUTERS/Beawiharta\n\nIn a televised address, Widodo said he had received a lot of feedback on the new law including on whether to use his authority to replace it by issuing a regulation instead.\n\n\u201cOf course we will consider it, assess it immediately,\u201d Widodo told reporters.\n\nThe Corruption Eradication Commission, known by its Indonesian initials, KPK, has prosecuted hundreds of politicians, officials and businessmen since its formation in 2002, becoming one of the country\u2019s most respected agencies.\n\nActivists say revisions to the law approved by parliament last week will hurt the fight against graft. The changes include curbing the agency\u2019s freedom to wiretap suspects and creating a committee to oversee the agency.\n\nAnger over the new law and a plan to revise Indonesia\u2019s criminal code that would ban extramarital sex and penalise insulting the president\u2019s honour have sparked student rallies.\n\nTens of thousands have joined the biggest rallies since 1998 student protests fuelled unrest that led to the fall of former strongman Suharto.\n\nWidodo has delayed parliament\u2019s vote on the criminal code, which would replace a Dutch colonial-era set of laws, saying a new parliament should review the bill next month.\n\nOn Thursday, Widodo also said he would look at feedback on whether it \u201cintruded too far into private lives and at other chapters, including the code on insulting the president\u201d.\n\nWhile the proposed ban on extra-marital sex has grabbed headlines abroad, the bill covers 628 articles in total and opposition in the country of 260 million people is based on a much wider set of concerns than sex.\n\nThe bill also penalises teachers of Marxist-Leninist ideology and women who have abortions in the absence of a medical emergency or rape.\n\nSTUDENT KILLED\n\nThe student rallies this week across a number of cities turned violent in several places with police firing tear gas and water cannon and with more than 300 hurt in Jakarta alone.\n\nA student died after being shot during a protest outside the parliament in Kendari on Sulawesi island, CNN Indonesia cited army commander Colonel Yustinus Nono Yulianto as saying.\n\nAnother student was critically hurt in Jakarta with head injuries, officials and the university said.\n\nAmnesty International said authorities should \u201cimmediately initiate a thorough and impartial investigation into massive police violence against students during protests\u201d.\n\nAt least 200 people have been arrested since the rallies began on Monday, national police chief Tito Karnavian told a news conference.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s Chief Security Minister Wiranto has said the student protests were hijacked by a group aiming to disrupt parliament and the inauguration of President Widodo next month for a new term.\n\n\u201cThe brutal demonstrations perpetrated by rioters, fighting against officers, throwing rocks, shooting fireworks at the officers at night ... they were trying to make victims,\u201d Wiranto told a news conference.\n\nWidodo is due to be sworn in for a second term on Oct. 20 after winning this year\u2019s general election.\n\nWiranto did not name the group he said was manipulating the protests, but he described an effort to get radical Islamic groups, soccer supporters and labour groups to join the rallies.", "description": "Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on Thursday he is considering revoking a new law governing the country's anti-corruption agency, which has alarmed activists and helped drive the biggest student protests in decades.", "authors": ["Stanley Widianto", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434204921&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P0DU", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
