You can form your own view.

The prime minister joked with the Iranian leader, who was seen laughing and clapping.\n\nMr Ratcliffe, a Hampstead-based accountant, called on the premier to take a tougher line with Tehran.\n\n\u201cI have asked the government to be tough and say that hostage-taking is not acceptable, and I hope this is what is said behind closed doors,\u201d Mr Ratcliffe told The Independent.\n\n\u201cThere has been an increasing pattern of more and more [foreigners] being arrested and held. Iran must be told they cannot continue, and they need to start releasing people.\u201d\n\nHe said that Jeremy Hunt, Mr Johnson\u2019s predecessor as foreign secretary and one-time rival for the Conservative leadership, had been clearer in his message demanding the government lead a coalition of allies at the UN against \u201cdiplomatic hostage-taking\u201d.\n\nHe expressed concern that Mr Johnson would be less forthright \u2013 even though taking action could make amends for his comments as foreign secretary in 2017, when he said Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe was in Iran teaching journalism, inadvertently bolstering Iran\u2019s charges against her.\n\nThe family insisted she was on holiday when she was arrested. The government later clarified that there was \u201cno doubt\u201d this was the case.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

States need to be more robust and coordinated in their criticism of Iran,\u201d Mr Ratcliffe continued.\n\n\u201cThere are British citizens right now sitting in solitary confinement, some for almost a year even though they have not done anything. This is unacceptable.\n\n\u201cThis will not be solved by smiling at Iran,\u201d he added.\n\nA number of dual nationals has been detained over recent years mostly on trumped-up espionage charges. Rights groups have reported a worrying spike in detentions this year. In August, Iranian judicial officials reported that Anousheh Ashouri, a British-Iranian dual national, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, again on spying charges.\n\nA few weeks later, the Iranians arrested two British-Australian women, Kylie Moore-Gilbert, a Middle East politics specialist at Melbourne University, and travel blogger Jolie King, together with Mark Firkin, an Australian man \u2013 on unknown charges. They are all reportedly being held in Evin prison, where Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe is detained. There are thought to be several other dual nationals also languishing in prison.\n\nMr Johnson repeated his call for the immediate release of Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other dual nationals during Wednesday\u2019s meeting with President Rouhani. He also apparently invited the Iranian leader back to London, calling this \u201cprogress\u201d on the cases of British citizens detained in Tehran.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s meeting came amid soaring tensions with the Islamic republic. Mr Johnson, along with France and Germany, blamed Tehran for recent attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities. He also called a 2015 Iranian nuclear pact a \u201cbad deal\u201d, echoing US president Donald Trump, Iran\u2019s arch-foe. Mr Johnson stressed support for a \u201csuccessor\u201d to the Iran nuclear deal and the need for dialogue, Downing Street said.\n\nNo 10 said that in his meeting with President Rouhani, Mr Johnson also \u201craised our deep concern about Iran\u2019s destabilising activity in the region, including the attacks on the Aramco oil facilities, and insisted this must stop.\u201d", "description": "The husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u00a0has urged\u00a0Boris Johnson\u00a0to lobby harder for\u00a0her release from a Tehran\u00a0jail after\u00a0the prime minister met the Iranian\u00a0president.", "authors": ["Bel Trew"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/25/15/johnson-rouhani.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
