Wilson said the driver was experienced and had driver training certification. Wilson said the driver sustained non-life-threatening injuries and had been released from hospital.\n\nA company statement said the bus was equipped with seatbelts, though it is not known how many onboard were wearing their belts at the time of the crash. B.C.'s Motor Vehicle Act requires all drivers and passengers to use seatbelts if the vehicle is equipped with them.\n\nThe RCMP is investigating the cause of the crash.
