Here Are 3 Reasons He\u2019s Right.", "language": "en", "text": "Voices are clamoring for President Donald Trump to make small nuclear deals with Iran and North Korea. All the arguments for doing so are bad.\n\nFor Trump, making a small, unserious deal goes against his gut instinct. If there\u2019s one thing he has consistently demonstrated as president, it\u2019s that he knows snake oil foreign policy when he sees it.\n\nWhile the president may be right to be skeptical of all-or-nothing strategies that demand surrender or regime change or else, he is equally wise to be wary of Band-Aid diplomacy that\u2019s likely to just bleed out in the end.\n\nThe calls for the president to grab small deals are proliferating faster than Korean boy bands.\n\nVox recently floated a claim that the U.S. would offer North Korea 36 months of sanctions relief in exchange for taking baby steps toward denuclearization. Iran recently said they would agree to talks\u2014as long as Trump lifted sanctions first.\n\nSuddenly, we\u2019re hearing all kinds of bright ideas on how to jumpstart diplomacy with rogue nations. What these ideas all have in common is they require the U.S. to give a lot up-front in exchange for very little.\n\nThese are sucker deals. The multiple mini-deals with North Korea being floated, for example, are actually worse than real agreements adopted by previous administrations.\n\nHere are the main problems with small-deal psychology.\n\n1. Look who is for them: all the wrong people.\n\nMost of the cheering has come from the arms control crowd. They cherish diplomatic process over real progress. They hate the administration and everything it stands for, and they\u2019ll be the first to say Trump should be thrown under the bus when things don\u2019t work out.\n\n2. Look who they embolden: the other side.\n\nSmall deals take all the pressure off and only encourage the other side to think they\u2019re unwinding our negotiating strategy. That emboldens them and weakens our position.\n\nThe president has had the guts to put the squeeze on Iran and North Korea, and look what he has accomplished. North Korea is at the negotiating. Even Iran publicly admits they could envision negotiating a better agreement than the Iran deal.\n\n3. Look at what small deals get us: not very much.\n\nAt best, we get some symbolic or marginal commitments that don\u2019t address the core national security concerns at play\u2014the very concerns that got the president to put his power and prestige on the line to begin with.\n\nLikely as well, there is zero political gain from small deals. Critics will dismiss a small nuke deal as just \u201cwagging the dog,\u201d an attempt to distract the public from the lack of progress being made.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that small deals will improve the president\u2019s popularity, either. Those that already like him will continue supporting him. Those that don\u2019t, won\u2019t. Others will look to bigger issues to decide which way they\u2019ll lean.\n\nThe president has a reputation for only doing good deals. It would be unwise for him to risk squandering that reputation on small-ball proposals, particularly when they bring real security risks.\n\nWhen the small deals inevitably fail\u2014as they would with North Korea and Iran\u2014our security would be worse off than when we\u2019d started.\n\nAs the president knows, it\u2019s a lot harder to mount a pressure campaign than to sustain one that\u2019s already begun. Once he gives up pressure\u2014when a deal fails\u2014the president\u2019s credibility will go with it.\n\nIn his heart, the president knows what to do with these adversaries: Hold out for the big deal.\n\nWe all know Trump isn\u2019t going to start World War III with North Korea or Iran. He knows that\u2019s not the right answer. But he also knows letting them off the hook would be a big mistake as well.\n\nNot all the terms of a nuclear deal need to be met in a New York minute. There is room for phases within a timeline. But those phases need to be nailed down up-front, and the deal must be single and overarching. The other side must commit to terms that leave them with no nukes in the end, and agree up-front to full, complete, and verifiable declaration of their nuclear assets.\n\nSure, it might take more pressure and more time to get a comprehensive deal. How much time? As much as it takes, because good and sustainable national security solutions are worth waiting for.\n\nWhen the president was in the private sector, he wanted to build only the best buildings\u2014buildings to be proud of, buildings that stood the test of time. As president, he wants foreign policy that will stand the test of time as well, and make Americans proud.\n\nSmall deals are a sad excuse for a legacy.", "description": "Voices are clamoring for President Donald Trump to make small nuclear deals with Iran and North Korea.
