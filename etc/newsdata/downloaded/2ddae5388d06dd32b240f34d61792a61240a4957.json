Barr did not take questions from reporters in his first public appearance after former special prosecutor Robert Mueller spoke to reporters after resigning at the completion of his report into Russian interference into the 2016 election. (AP Photo/Mark Thiessen)\n\nIn March, I wrote a post in which I asked, \u201cWhat is the connection between James Clapper, Victor Pinchuk, and the chief technology officer of CrowdStrike, which was the only company the DNC allowed to access their server?\u201d This post jumped into my head the moment I saw a Breitbart article reporting that one of Adam Schiff\u2019s staffers had met with diplomat William Taylor on a trip to Ukraine which was organized by The Atlantic Council. I had written:\n\nUkrainian billionaire and longtime contributor to the Clinton Foundation Victor Pinchuk, was doing his best to promote a Clinton victory. Pinchuk serves on the International Advisory Board of a Washington-based think tank called the Atlantic Council. This group is \u201cconnected to Ukrainian interests through its \u201cUkraine in Europe Initiative,\u201d which is designed to galvanize international support for an independent Ukraine within secure borders whose people will determine their own future.\u201d Also serving on the International Advisory Board of the Atlantic Council is James Clapper, who served as Obama\u2019s Director of National Intelligence. Funnily enough, [Dan] Bongino discovered that the Chief Technology Officer of \u201cthe only company that investigated the hacking of the DNC\u2019s servers and quickly determined it was the Russians, is a nonresident senior fellow in cybersecurity\u201d at the Atlantic Council. His name is Dmitri Alperovitch.\n\nPlease keep this in mind as you read this post.\n\nThe Atlantic Council is a super liberal think-tank which receives much of its funding from Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian natural gas company where Hunter Biden had served as a board member.\n\nBreitbart\u2019s Aaron Klein obtained a copy of travel documents which showed that, twelve days after the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d submitted his complaint to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, one of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff\u2019s staffers, Thomas Eager, held a meeting with acting U.S. ambassador (or Charge d\u2019Affaires) to Ukraine William Taylor. The two were on a trip to Ukraine which had been organized by The Atlantic Council. It was \u201cbilled as a bipartisan Ukraine Study Trip in which ten Congressional staffers participated.\u201d\n\nEager is a member of The Atlantic Council and Taylor has a \u201cclose relationship\u201d with the organization as well.\n\nKlein writes that Schiff\u2019s office has refused to respond to any of Breitbart\u2019s questions or comment requests. Specifically, Breitbart had asked, \u201cWhile in Ukraine, did Mr. Eager speak to Mr. Taylor about the issue of reports about any representatives of President Trump looking into alleged Biden corruption in Ukraine?\u201d\n\nThe trip took place between August 24 and August 31. The \u201cwhistleblower\u201d filed his complaint on August 12. Last week, we learned that Schiff had lied when he told MSNBC on September 17, \u201cWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower. We would like to.\u201d Via the New York Times, we found out that one of Schiff\u2019s staffers had been approached by the whistleblower before he filed his complaint and shared this information with Schiff.\n\nFollowing is one of the text message exchanges between Taylor and U.S. ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland. It shows Taylor\u2019s obvious bias against President Trump, so naturally Schiff has made him a key witness in his impeachment inquiry over Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Taylor is scheduled to provide a deposition next week.\n\nNBC News\u2019 reported that Taylor will be \u201crepresented during the deposition by attorney John Bellinger, a prominent \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republican who served in the George W. Bush administration.\u201d\n\nHere is one of the exchanges. (Via NPR)\n\nOn September 9th, Taylor wrote: \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d Sondland responds: \u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d Sondland adds, \u201cI suggest we stop the back and forth by text.\u201d)\n\nTo give you an idea of how deeply involved, and therefore how \u201canti-Trump\u201d Taylor is, I am including the details from Klein\u2019s article. He does go into the weeds, but it explains how interconnected, almost incestuous, all of these players are. I recommend at least a quick scan of his findings.\n\nWhen we see how extensive the network\u2019s tentacles go, we begin to understand how they were able to carry out their plot against President Trump and to avoid detection for so long. All of the actors cover for and facilitate each other. We also realize that Ukraine has been the common denominator for a large part of the conspiracy to take down the Trump administration.\n\nFormer U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, whose prepared opening statement to the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry team was leaked to the press last week, said she was recalled based on \u201cunfounded and false claims.\u201d I found a major lie in her testimony. She had written, \u201cAs Mr. Lutsenko, the former Ukrainian Prosecutor General has recently acknowledged, the notion that I created or disseminated a \u201cdo not prosecute\u201d list is completely false\u2014a story that Mr. Lutsenko, himself, has since retracted.\u201d The reality is that Lutsenko has done no such thing. I posted about this here. And you can bet this was not her only lie. She is likely up to her eyeballs in wrongdoing.\n\nThe left has perpetrated such a major fraud which has involved so many, I don\u2019t see how it could not leave a paper trail. The bigger an operation becomes, the more difficult it is to contain. Each additional participant adds to the risk of exposure. And in an operation as vast and far-reaching as this one, someone is going to slip up.\n\nI have confidence that Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham have already found or will find the evidence necessary to blow this giant ambush of the U.S. President wide open.\n\nDetails: VIA Breitbart\n\nTaylor and The Atlantic Council\n\nTaylor has authored numerous analysis pieces published by the Atlantic Council. In March, three months before he became Trump\u2019s ambassador to Ukraine, the Atlantic Council featured an oped co-authored by Taylor in which the diplomat argued Ukraine \u201chas further to travel toward its self-proclaimed European goal\u201d of reformation. In 2017, Taylor wrote a piece for the Council about a Ukrainian parliament vote on health care reform. In November 2011, the Atlantic Council hosted Taylor as the featured speaker at a discussion event when he was appointed that year as Special Coordinator for Middle East Transitions at the State Department. When he deployed to Ukraine as Trump\u2019s ambassador in June, the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC), which has co-hosted events with the Atlantic Council, authored a piece in the Kyiv Post welcoming him. Taylor for the last nine years served as a senior adviser to the USUBC. The USUBC\u2019s piece noted that the \u201cUSUBC has worked closely with Ambassador Taylor for many years,\u201d touting his role as the business group\u2019s senior adviser. On June 26, just nine days after arriving in Ukraine as ambassador, the USUBC already hosted Taylor for a roundtable discussion about his new position. Vadym Pozharskyi, adviser to the board of directors at Burisma Holdings, was also previously hosted as a USUBC featured speaker. A USUBC senior adviser is David J. Kramer, a long-time adviser to late Senator John McCain, who served at the McCain Institute for International Leadership as senior director for human rights and democracy. Kramer played a central role in disseminating the anti-Trump dossier. In the USUBC piece welcoming Taylor to Ukraine, Kramer himself commented about Taylor\u2019s ambassador position. \u201cHe\u2019s a great choice for now,\u201d Kramer gushed. Geysha Gonzalez is the sponsoring Atlantic Council officer listed on the Congressional disclosure form for Schiff staffer Eager\u2019s trip to Ukraine. She is deputy director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center. Gonzalez is also one of eleven members of the rapid response team for the Ukrainian Election Task Force, which says it is working to expose \u201cforeign interference in Ukraine\u2019s democracy.\u201d Another member of the team is Kramer. Kramer revealed in testimony that he held a meeting about the anti-Trump dossier with a reporter from BuzzFeed News, who he says snapped photos of the controversial document without Kramer\u2019s permission when he left the room to go to the bathroom. That meeting was held at the McCain Institute office in Washington, Kramer stated. BuzzFeed infamously published the Christopher Steele dossier on January 10, 2017, setting off a firestorm of news media coverage about the document. The Washington Post reported last February that Kramer received the dossier directly from Fusion GPS after McCain expressed interest in it. In a deposition taken on December 13, 2017, and posted online earlier this year, Kramer revealed that he met with two Obama administration officials to inquire about whether the anti-Trump dossier was being taken seriously. In one case, Kramer said that he personally provided a copy of the dossier to Obama National Security Council official Celeste Wallander. In the deposition, Kramer said that McCain specifically asked him in early December 2016 to meet about the dossier with Wallander and Victoria Nuland, a senior official in John Kerry\u2019s State Department.\n\nSchiff signed form\n\nSchiff\u2019s signature appears on the required post-travel disclosure form filed with the House Committee on Ethics documenting the visit to Ukraine. The form signed by Schiff says that Eager\u2019s trip to Ukraine was paid for by the \u201cAtlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center.\u201d The form bearing Schiff\u2019s signature (above) describes the visit thusly: Series of meetings and visits with gov\u2019t officials, party officials, civil society and private sector reps in Ukraine to learn about ongoing political and military issues, including conflict in the East. The costs for Eager\u2019s visit listed on the form are $2202.91 for transportation, $985.50 for lodging, and $630.15 for meal expenses. Speaking to Breitbart News, Gonzalez confirmed that Eager started his one-year fellowship with the organization in January and that Eager is still a fellow. Gonzalez said the pre-planned trip was part of the fellowship program, which also includes a full year of round tables and other educational events. She said it was not within her portfolio to comment on issues of funding from Burisma or other donors.\n\nBurisma and Atlantic Council\n\nBesides funding the Atlantic Council, Burisma also routinely partners with the think tank. Only four months ago, the company co-hosted the Council\u2019s second Annual Kharkiv Security Conference. Burisma further co-hosted a U.S.-Ukraine Business Council event with the Council last year in Washington, DC. David Kramer of the dossier episode is a senior adviser to the Business Council. Burisma and the Atlantic Council also signed a cooperative agreement to develop transatlantic programs with Burisma\u2019s financial support, reportedly to focus \u201con European and international energy security.\u201d Burisma advertises that it committed itself to \u201c15 key principles of rule of law and economic policy in Ukraine developed by the Atlantic Council.\u201d\n\nCommon funding themes\n\nBesides Burisma funding, the Atlantic Council is also financed by billionaire activist George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations, Google, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Inc., and the U.S. State Department. Google, Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations, the Rockefeller Fund, and an agency of the State Department each also finance a self-described investigative journalism organization repeatedly referenced as a source of information in the so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d complaint alleging Trump was \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country\u201d in the 2020 presidential race. The charges in the July 22 report referenced in the \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d document and released by the Google and Soros-funded organization, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), seem to be the public precursors for a lot of the so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d own claims, as Breitbart News documented. One key section of the so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d document claims that \u201cmultiple U.S. officials told me that Mr. Giuliani had reportedly privately reached out to a variety of other Zelensky advisers, including Chief of Staff Andriy Bohdan and Acting Chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine Ivan Bakanov.\u201d This was allegedly to follow up on Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky in order to discuss the \u201ccases\u201d mentioned in that call, according to the so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d narrative. The complainer was clearly referencing Trump\u2019s request for Ukraine to investigate the Biden corruption allegations. Even though the statement was written in first person \u2013 \u201cmultiple U.S. officials told me\u201d \u2013 it contains a footnote referencing a report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). That footnote reads: In a report published by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) on 22 July, two associates of Mr. Giuliani reportedly traveled to Kyiv in May 2019 and met with Mr. Bakanov and another close Zelensky adviser, Mr. Serhiy Shefir. The so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d account goes on to rely upon that same OCCRP report on three more occasions. It does so to: Write that Ukraine\u2019s Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko \u201calso stated that he wished to communicate directly with Attorney General Barr on these matters.\u201d Document that Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani \u201chad spoken in late 2018 to former Prosecutor General Shokin, in a Skype call arranged by two associates of Mr. Giuliani.\u201d Bolster the charge that, \u201cI also learned from a U.S. official that \u2018associates\u2019 of Mr. Giuliani were trying to make contact with the incoming Zelenskyy team.\u201d The so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d then relates in another footnote, \u201cI do not know whether these associates of Mr. Giuliani were the same individuals named in the 22 July report by OCCRP, referenced above.\u201d The OCCRP report repeatedly referenced is actually a \u201cjoint investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and BuzzFeed News, based on interviews and court and business records in the United States and Ukraine.\u201d BuzzFeed infamously also first published the full anti-Trump dossier alleging unsubstantiated collusion between Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russia. The dossier was paid for by Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee, and was produced by the Fusion GPS opposition dirt outfit. The OCCRP and BuzzFeed \u201cjoint investigation\u201d resulted in both OCCRP and BuzzFeed publishing similar lengthy pieces on July 22 claiming that Giuliani was attempting to use connections to have Ukraine investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals. The so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d document, however, only mentions the largely unknown OCCRP and does not reference BuzzFeed, which has faced scrutiny over its reporting on the Russia collusion claims.", "description": "Another Major Clue: Documents Reveal Schiff Staffer Met with Key Impeachment Inquiry Witness on August Ukraine Trip", "authors": ["Elizabeth Vaughn", "Alex Parker", "Nick Arama", "Kira Davis", "Stu Cvrk", "Posted At Am On October"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bill-barr.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
