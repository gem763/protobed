He also believes the congressman should be investigated after entering false and fake testimony into the congressional record during a hearing Thursday morning with Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff totally made up my conversation with Ukraine President and read it to Congress and Millions. He must resign and be investigated. He has been doing this for two years. He is a sick man! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2019\n\n...sound horrible, and me sound guilty. HE WAS DESPERATE AND HE GOT CAUGHT. Adam Schiff therefore lied to Congress and attempted to defraud the American Public. He has been doing this for two years. I am calling for him to immediately resign from Congress based on this fraud! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2019\n\nAs a reminder, this is what Schiff did:\n\nRep. Schiff re-writes the call transcript for added drama: \"I\u2019m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good, I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand, lots of it, on this and on that, I\u2019m going to put you in touch with people\" pic.twitter.com/1rV7BpEN6o \u2014 Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) September 26, 2019\n\nYou can read directly about what President Trump discussed with the Ukrainian President during a call in July here. It's far from what Schiff literally made up.\n\nEventually, Schiff admitted during the hearing that his words were a \"parody\" after getting called out by fellow Congressmen and women.", "description": ".09/27/2019 11:00:03AM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Leah Barkoukis", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/269/3bbe62de-7a45-453d-844e-7d8a20ffc26b.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
