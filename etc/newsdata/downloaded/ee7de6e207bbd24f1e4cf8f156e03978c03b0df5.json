Tehran has denied responsibility for the attack.\n\nTrump reacted to the attack with furor over the weekend, tweeting Sunday that the U.S. was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d but would wait to discuss a response with the Saudis once they had a better idea of who was behind the attacks.\n\nWhile the president has still not personally named Iran as the culprit of the attacks, he inched closer to doing so throughout the day on Monday, teasing that \u201cyou'll find out at the right time\u201d who the U.S. believes is responsible but that \u201cit is too early to tell you that now.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\n\u201cYou're going to find out in great detail in the near future. We have the exact location of just about everything,\u201d he said.\n\nOther members of his administration have been more explicit, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\n\"Tehran is behind nearly 100 attacks on Saudi Arabia while Rouhani and Zarif pretend to engage in diplomacy. Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply. There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen,\" Pompeo wrote on Twitter on Saturday, referring to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.\n\nPompeo issued a call for \u201call nations to publicly and unequivocally condemn Iran\u2019s attacks\u201d and vowed that Iran would be \u201cheld accountable for its aggression.\u201d\n\nZarif, in turn, mocked Pompeo in a tweet, writing that \u201cHaving failed at max pressure, Pompeo's turning to max deceit,\" a reference to the Trump administration\u2019s characterization of its Iran policy.\n\nAt the White House on Monday, Trump downplayed any daylight between himself and his top diplomat as he juggled the first international crisis since the abrupt exit of his former national security adviser \u2014 and notorious Iran hawk \u2014 John Bolton.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re the same,\u201d Trump told reporters when asked why Pompeo had been more unequivocal than he was in blaming Iran. \u201cI think we just want to find out the final numbers and see \u2014 you look at a vector, you look at \u2014 there are lots of different things we can look at, David. And we\u2018ll know for certain over the next pretty short period of time.\u201d\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper said he\u2019d been in touch with allies in the region, including Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman and Iraqi Defense Minister Najah al-Shammari, about the strikes. In a series of tweets Monday afternoon, Esper said he\u2019d just returned to the Pentagon after briefing Trump on the situation, adding that multiple U.S. agencies were working together to address what he called an \u201cunprecedented attack and defend the international rules-based order that is being undermined by Iran.\u201d\n\nThe attack comes as tensions in the regions have simmered for months as Iran continues to take steps toward breaching the 2015 nuclear deal while under crushing sanctions from the U.S. It also comes amid dashed hopes of a potential meeting between Trump and Rouhani at the U.N. General Assembly later this week.\n\nBoth leaders took steps back from even the possibility of a face-to-face meeting. According to state-run news outlet Fars, Iran\u2019s foreign minister said Monday that \u201cneither is such a plan on our agenda nor will such a thing happen,\u201d despite Rouhani\u2019s earlier suggestions that a meeting could be arranged if the U.S. let up on its sanctions.\n\nTrump also reversed himself over the weekend, blasting the media for correctly reporting that he and Pompeo had said at least in the last week he\u2019d be willing to meet with Rouhani with no preconditions.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani. | Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nOfficials in Washington and Tehran have frequently offered conflicting accounts of a number of clashes in the Persian Gulf, including over Iran's downing of a U.S. drone and of a series of explosions on foreign tankers earlier in the summer that the U.S. similarly pointed the finger at Iran for.\n\nMonday morning, Trump had pointed to prior controversies that he said cast doubt on Iran's denials.\n\n\u201cRemember when Iran shot down a drone, saying knowingly that it was in their 'airspace' when, in fact, it was nowhere close,\u201d he asked in a tweet, referring to Iran\u2019s downing of an unmanned U.S. aircraft three months ago.\n\n\u201cThey stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie. Now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on Saudi Arabia,\u201d he continued, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ll see?\u201d\n\nAfter Saturday's attacks, U.S. officials released satellite photos of the damage, which they say indicate the attackers approached from the north, where Iran and Iraq are located relative to Saudi Arabia, rather than the south, where Houthi rebels in are based in Yemen, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe Saudis on Monday warned that they had not come to a final conclusion about who was behind the attacks, though a spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis in Yemen strongly suggested that Iran was likely responsible.\n\nAt a news conference in Riyadh, Colonel Turki al-Malki told reporters that preliminary results of the investigation showed the attack did not originate in Yemen and involved Iranian weapons.\n\nAt the White House, Trump announced that Pompeo \u201cand others\u201d would travel to Saudia Arabia in the near future \u201cto discuss what they feel\u201d and would \u201cmake a statement fairly soon.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cthey also know something that most people don't know as to where it came from, who did it, and we'll be able to find that out and figure that out very quickly. We pretty much already know.\u201d\n\nStill, Trump repeatedly insisted that he was not looking to go to war with Iran, though he did tell reporters that \u201csometimes you have to\u201d engage in military conflict and that the U.S. is \u201cmore prepared than any country \u2026 in any history if we have to go that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will tell you that was a very large attack and it could be met with an attack many, many times larger, very easily by our country. But we're going to find out who definitively did it first,\u201d he said, explaining that he would consult with the remaining signatories of the faltering 2015 nuclear deal.\n\nHe also reiterated that he would defer to Saudi Arabia when concocting a response to the strikes, a stance that\u2019s made some in the national security crowd bristle. But he swatted away a reporter\u2019s query about whether diplomacy with Iran had been exhausted, declaring that is \u201cnever\u201d the case.\n\nThe interruption of the equivalent of more than 5 percent of the world\u2019s daily oil supply have caused oil prices to surge, and Trump said he\u2019d authorized the release of U.S. strategic petroleum reserves in a \u201cto-be-determined amount\u201d to stabilize oil markets if necessary, but sought to ease concerns of any shortage. The attacks forced Saudi Arabia to slash its production in half, however, and it\u2019s unclear how long the facilities targeted will remain down.\n\nWhite House officials continued to exude an air of confidence that the U.S. oil boom would provide insulation from any shocks to the market stemming from the strikes. Marc Short, the vice president\u2019s chief of staff, told reporters Monday that that was what Trump meant in his \u201clocked and loaded\u201d tweet.\n\n\u201cI think that 'locked and loaded' is a broad term and talks about the realities that we\u2019re all far safer and more secure domestically from energy independence,\" he said.\n\n\u201cThis is not the 1970s oil embargo. It\u2019s not 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re now a net oil exporter which means that the American market is much better protected.\u201d\n\nTrump echoed that, telling reporters that the disruption in the Persian Gulf \u201cwon\u2019t affect us, and ultimately I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll affect the world, either.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look at what we have, we have tremendous amounts of oil in our country,\u201d he said.\n\nShort and Trump\u2019s assurances appeared to do little to soothe nerves: Futures for brent crude oil, the global benchmark, surged 14.6 percent to $69.02 a barrel by the end of the day \u2014 the largest one-day percentage gain in three decades, according to Retuers. At one point, prices rose nearly 20 percent, the biggest intra-day gain since the first Persian Gulf War in 1991. Analysts pinned the blame on Trump\u2019s threat.\n\nStill, Energy Secretary Rick Perry said Monday that he\u2019d like to see international energy producers band together in light of the threat from Iran.\n\n\u201cIt is a time for a coalition of tame and thoughtful energy producing and energy consuming countries to come together and put a stop to Iran\u2019s malign activity,\u201d he said in an interview on CNBC.\n\nHe expressed confidence that such a group would come together, adding that \u201cit\u2019s time for us to be globally spending a message that Iran cannot be allowed to act in the way they are acting. They are attacking oil supplies to try to disrupt the global economy.\u201d\n\nTrump allies in Congress were split over how the president should counter the strikes. Over the weekend, Sen. Lindsey Graham, an Iran hardliner, said that Trump needed to put striking Iranian oil refineries on the table as possible retaliation.\n\nThe president appeared to take note of that idea, telling reporters he would consider that to be a proportionate response to the strikes.\n\nBut Florida Sen. Marco Rubio called for a forceful yet restrained response, arguing that barging into a military conflict with Iran could involve numerous other countries and would be hard to de-escalate.\n\n\u201c#Iran has spent 10 years building capacity to do exactly what they did on Saturday in #SaudiArabia. Inflict damage on adversary but have a 3rd party proxy group either conduct attack or claim credit for it,\u201d he said in a slew of tweets, adding that Iran\u2019s goal \u201cis to punish rivals while avoiding international condemnation.\u201d\n\nRubio suggested that the U.S. needed to first lay out its evidence implicating Iran at the U.N. General Assembly before making sure that any future nuclear deal with Iran addresses its sponsorship of terror and its possession of rockets. Still, he argued, while the U.S. needed to maintain diplomacy as the core of its Iran strategy, Trump needs to assert his right to punish those responsible for the attacks and eliminate the capacity to carry out future attacks while keeping defense assurances to allies in the region.\n\nFailure to address Iran now, he argued, means that Tehran \u201cwill attain irreversible leverage over the entire region\u201d in a matter of years.\n\nTrump, asked in the Oval Office whether Saudi Arabia\u2019s defense was their own responsibility, noted that he hadn\u2019t promised them anything in regard to coming to their defense.\n\n\u201cThe Saudis want very much for us to protect them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was an attack on Saudi Arabia. And that wasn't an attack on us. But we would certainly help them.\u201d\n\n", "description": "The president said 'certainly it would look' like Iran was responsible for the drone strike.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/09/de/b1d415de4dd4bc90e7508c1ae9dc/190916-trump-saudi-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
