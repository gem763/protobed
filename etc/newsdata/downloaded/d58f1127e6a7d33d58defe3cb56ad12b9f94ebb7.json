Donald Trump\u2019s top diplomat also said Tehran was engaging in false diplomacy.\n\nMajor Saudi Arabia oil facilities hit by Houthi drone strikes Read more\n\nIran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for the drone attack on the world\u2019s largest oil processing facility, which is vital to global energy supplies.\n\n\u201cTehran is behind nearly 100 attacks on Saudi Arabia while [President Hassan] Rouhani and [foreign minister Javad] Zarif pretend to engage in diplomacy,\u201d Pompeo said on Twitter on Saturday afternoon.\n\n\u201cAmid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply.\u201d\n\nTensions have been rising between the Washington and Tehran, after Trump withdrew the US from a nuclear deal between world powers and the Islamic Republic.\n\nIran has restarted some uranium enrichment in violation of the 2015 nuclear accord and the US has imposed sanctions. But Trump has recently held the door open for nuclear talks to begin, perhaps on the sidelines of the United National General Assembly in New York later this month. Pompeo said such talks could take place without any preconditions.\n\nAmid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply Mike Pompeo\n\nOn Saturday, before Pompeo\u2019s tweet, the White House said Trump had spoken to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, \u201cto offer his support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s self-defense\u201d.\n\nSaudi Arabia backs the Yemeni government in a brutal civil war which began in 2015. Iran backs the Houthis, who hold the capital, Sanaa, and other territory in the Arab world\u2019s poorest country.\n\nResponding to Pompeo\u2019s tweet on Saturday, the Democratic senator Chris Murphy, a member of the foreign relations committee, wrote: \u201cThis is such irresponsible simplification and it\u2019s how we get into dumb wars of choice.\n\n\u201cThe Saudis and Houthis are at war. The Saudis attack the Houthis and the Houthis attack back. Iran is backing the Houthis and has been a bad actor, but it\u2019s just not as simple as Houthis = Iran.\u201d\n\nThe Republican senator Lindsey Graham, a leading Trump ally, disagreed.\n\n\u201cIt is now time for the US to put on the table an attack on Iranian oil refineries if they continue their provocations or increase nuclear enrichment,\u201d the South Carolina senator said on Twitter.\n\nIt remained unclear if anyone was injured at the Abqaiq oil processing facility and the Khurais oil field, operated by Saudi Aramco. The attack early on Saturday sparked a huge fire, the kingdom\u2019s interior ministry said.\n\nThe US embassy in Riyadh said it was unaware of any injuries to Americans. Saudi Aramco employs a number of US citizens, some of whom live in guarded compounds near the site.\n\nA military spokesman for the Houthi rebels claimed responsibility, saying 10 drones had been deployed. The attack came after weeks of similar drone assaults on Saudi oil infrastructure, but none of the earlier strikes appeared to have caused such damage.\n\nAccording to Reuters, three sources claimed the assault disrupted output and exports, with one source claiming 5m barrels per day of crude production had been impacted \u2013 nearly half the kingdom\u2019s output.\n\nThis is such irresponsible simplification and it\u2019s how we get into dumb wars of choice Chris Murphy\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Arabia was shutting down about half of its oil output because of the incident. Authorities had not confirmed whether oil production or exports were affected.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said: \u201cThe United States strongly condemns today\u2019s attack on critical energy infrastructure. Violent actions against civilian areas and infrastructure vital to the global economy only deepen conflict and mistrust.\n\n\u201cThe United States Government is monitoring the situation and remains committed to ensuring global oil markets are stable and well supplied.\u201d\n\nThe war has become the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis, pushing Yemen to the brink of famine and killing more than 90,000 people, according to the US-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, or Acled.\n\nSince the start of the war, Houthi rebels have been using drones in combat. The first appeared to be hobby-kit-style. Later, versions nearly identical to Iranian models turned up. Iran denies supplying the Houthis with weapons, although the United Nations, the West and Gulf Arab nations say it does so.\n\nRebels have flown drones into the radar arrays of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Patriot missile batteries, according to Conflict Armament Research, disabling them and allowing the Houthis to fire ballistic missiles into the kingdom unchallenged.\n\nThe Houthis launched drone attacks targeting Saudi Arabia\u2019s crucial East-West Pipeline in May. In August, Houthi drones struck Saudi Arabia\u2019s Shaybah oil field.", "description": "US secretary of state says Tehran behind drone attack while Trump speaks to Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c24db88532d6daabef01ae044a583e60ec730d69/0_86_2592_1556/master/2592.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f75be2ef61935b99bb74a98934a97373", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
