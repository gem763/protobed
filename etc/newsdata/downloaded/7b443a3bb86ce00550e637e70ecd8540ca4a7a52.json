Topshop recently launched an immersive experience in its flagship store encouraging customers to touch displays, take pictures and relax on the soft furnishings. Samsung\u2019s new experiential store in Kings Cross allows customer to experience its products, attend masterclasses and provide the consumer with key information by the tech experts.\u201d\n\nOne in five respondents also reported having had a disagreement with a member of staff due to being annoyed when shopping, and this led to three in 10 to decide to shop online instead.\n\nOne sixth admitted they felt stressed and frustrated when clothes shopping specifically, while one in 10 found themselves \u201cbored\u201d.\n\nMore than a third viewed shopping as an experience and aspects which make a great store were found to be attractive interior, plants and \u201cInstagram-able\u201d spaces.\n\nIt also emerged that a quarter of respondents would like to see apps which allow you to scan items to avoid having to wait at the checkout, while one in 10 would even like to to have AI-powered shop assistants.\n\nThe average respondent said they started to feel \u2018impatient after queueing for 10 minutes and nearly half wanted to see waiting times improved in the future.\n\nMore than a third said they would like to see packaging to be more environmentally friendly, with one in five saying they took into consideration whether items are produced ethically when buying them.\n\nA quarter of those polled said while they want to buy new things, they also want to help the planet and be sustainable.\n\nThe survey also suggested that almost a third believed shops were important to their local community and the same proportion of respondents thought the traditional high street filled with independent stores will return sometime in the future.\n\nMr Howley added: \u201cThese stats only reinforce that brands need to start offering an even more thrilling and enjoyable experience to the shopper, aside from just a good product. Brands need to think about the customer retail journey, what can you offer them to get them in store that you can\u2019t get online?\n\n\u201cYou need to think about what you can offer in terms of exclusivity, building hype around product drops, offering the Instagram photo-opp, from a fancy wall to some type of entertainment, or even an immersive sensory experience.\u201d\n\nSWNS", "description": "Stores being too hot or cold, the returns counter located on a different floor\u00a0and overpowering smells are among shoppers biggest complaints, according to a new poll.\u00a0 The survey of 2,000 Britons found\u00a0the layout of a shop changing, broken contactless card machines and having\u00a0no WiFi in store, also irked people.\u00a0 For shopping online, 45 per cent of respondents named slow web", "authors": ["Alice Hughes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/07/16/istock-623102584.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
