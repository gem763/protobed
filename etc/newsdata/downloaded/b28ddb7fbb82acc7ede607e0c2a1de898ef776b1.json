Reality Check unpacks the basics.\n\nEarlier, the European parliament's Brexit committee said the plan didn't match \"even remotely\" what had already been agreed.\n\nThe EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said he will be in a better position to judge possible future negotiations with the UK once he has spoken to his UK counterpart, David Frost.", "description": "Britain's latest proposals for leaving the EU fall short of what is required to get a deal, the bloc's leaders say.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/441F/production/_109093471_93d426eb-a659-4206-8963-99db11011ebd.jpg"}
