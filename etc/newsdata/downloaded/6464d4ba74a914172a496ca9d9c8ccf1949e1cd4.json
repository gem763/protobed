The surprise announcement left many in the village seemingly unsure how to respond, as if they hadn\u2019t yet received direction from the Palestinian Authority, the self-governing body with limited powers that provides some services here.\n\n\u201cLet them annex it,\u201d Muhammad Musa, 22, said of the Israelis. \u201cIt would be much better for our work.\u201d Like three of his brothers and most of the other men in this village of about 2,000 people, Mr. Musa labors by day as an agricultural worker in Tomer, an adjacent Jewish settlement.", "description": "In the West Bank village of Fasayil, near the border with Jordan, residents said Israel should fix the electricity before talking about annexation.", "authors": ["Isabel Kershner"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/10/world/10WEST-BANK-REAX1/10WEST-BANK-REAX1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
