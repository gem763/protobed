Then, its own voice assistant appeared in touchscreen devices made by third parties such as Lenovo and JBL.\n\nBut Google has finally put a stake in the ground with the Home Hub - its first branded smart display that functions as part photo frame, part control center for all your smart home devices.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nGoogle has finally put a stake in the ground with the Home Hub - its first on-brand smart display that functions as part photo frame, part control center for all your smart home devices\n\nGOOGLE HOME HUB SPECS 7in LCD screen Google Assistant built-in Runs on Google's Cast platform WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity Comes in Sand, Aqua, Chalk and Charcoal\n\nIt\u2019s easy to use and, with a price tag of $149, is likely the right price for a lot of people looking to introduce a smart display into their household.\n\nThe Home Hub is pretty compact, sporting a 7in screen, but that makes it easier to fit into small spaces on your bedside table, or kitchen countertop.\n\nAs with other Google Home devices, it\u2019s nice to look at, too - the screen has rounded corners and is on top of a fabric-covered base, making it appear less harsh and plasticy.\n\nDespite its size, you can\u2019t really miss the screen from far away, given its crisp colors and sharp display.\n\nThe device is also equipped with an ambient light sensor, called Ambient EQ, which automatically adjusts the screen\u2019s brightness based on the time of day.\n\nThat means it\u2019s easier on the eyes if you\u2019ve got the Home Hub next to your bed - no glaring blue screen here.\n\nGoogle gives you plenty of options to customize your Home Hub.\n\nOne of the standout features is the ability to connect it with your Google Photos account, so that it can show a rotating slideshow of your favorite pictures.\n\nAs with other Google devices, Home Hub is nice to look at - the screen has rounded corners and it\u2019s situated on top of a fabric-covered base, making it appear less harsh and plasticy\n\nGoogle put its AI smarts to work for this feature.\n\nIt\u2019s trained to recognize faces so that users can ask their Home Hub to display photos of a particular person, or from a certain place and time.\n\nYou can also ask the Home Hub when or where a photo was taken and it will tell you.\n\nI found myself less intrigued by the Home Hub\u2019s digital photo frame capabilities and more excited by the ability to connect it to my existing Google Home account. This allows the device to quickly ingest everything it needs to know about me - like my search history, services I use, and more.\n\nJust like other Google Assistant devices, it can learn to distinguish your voice from someone else\u2019s.\n\nOne note on voice recognition, however - make sure your Home Hub is located far away enough from your other Google Home devices, to prevent several devices from talking to you at once.\n\nAnother feature lets users set up personalized routines.\n\nFor example, the Home Hub can be trained in such a way that if users say \u2018Hey Google, good morning,\u2019 it will trigger a whole set of skills, like bringing up your calendar events for the day, news stories, the weather forecast and commute times, which is pretty handy.\n\nGoogle's new range: The firm unveiled the Home Hub, Pixel Slate and Pixel 3 at a New York event. It boasted AI technology is the core of each device, and hopes to gain ground in the hardware market on rivals like Apple, Samsung, Amazon and others\n\nSome info is easier to digest when you\u2019re able to see it visually, like a map of suggested routes to get to the office, as well as recipe instructions, which Google Assistant will read aloud\n\nUsers can already do this with Google Home devices, but the addition of a screen definitely helps.\n\nI found that some information is much easier to digest when you\u2019re able to see it visually, like a map of suggested routes to get to the office, as well as recipe instructions, which Google Assistant will read aloud and scroll through for you.\n\nWhile the Home Hub is a great hands-free device to help you get through your day, an entertainment center it is not.\n\nIt can play content from Google\u2019s own video platform, YouTube, but it doesn\u2019t have access to streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video or Hulu. The Home Hub also plays live TV broadcasts, but that requires a YouTube TV subscription.\n\nThat said, the device is conveniently integrated with Spotify.\n\nHOW DOES THE HOME HUB'S AMBIENT EQ SENSOR WORK? Google has equipped its Home Hub smart display with a high-tech sensor that helps the display detect when day turns into night. Called Ambient EQ, it may look like a camera at the top of the device, but it's not. The sensor automatically adjusts the screen\u2019s brightness based on the time of day. That means it\u2019s easier on the eyes if you\u2019ve got the Home Hub next to your bed - no glaring blue screen here. Google has equipped its Home Hub smart display with a high-tech sensor, called Ambient EQ, that helps the display detect when day turns into night 'When it's time for bed, Hub knows to dim the screen for a good night\u2019s sleep,' Google explained. And in the morning, the screen will automatically brighten to help wake you up. The Google Home Hub is the first Google device to feature this sensor. Users can turn it off or adjust it any time in the device's settings.\n\nHowever, I wouldn\u2019t recommend using the Home Hub as your main speaker system.\n\nThe single speaker on the back of the device is sufficiently loud, but definitely made better if you have other Google Home speakers to sync it with.\n\nGoogle recently introduced a new smart home control center that lets users manage all their smart home devices on a single screen - that means your lights, thermostats, security cameras and smart locks. Users just swipe down from the top of the Home Hub to access it.\n\nWith so many smart devices throughout the home, it can be annoying to manage them all using separate apps.\n\nThe Home Hub aims to simplify that with the control center, which I found to be one of its best features.\n\nIt can\u2019t control all your devices, such as Apple TVs or Sonos smart speakers, but I\u2019m sure it will get smarter with future software updates.\n\nWith so many smart devices, it can be annoying to manage them all using separate apps. The Home Hub aims to simplify that with the control center, which is one of its best features\n\nYou probably aren\u2019t too concerned about your privacy if you\u2019ve already introduced a Google Home or Amazon Echo into your home.\n\nStill, Google seems to have made the Home Hub with privacy in mind, opting to leave a camera (and video calls, by extension) off the device entirely.\n\nThis is a nice change from devices like the Echo Show or the recently launched Facebook Portal, which feature high-quality cameras and feel a tad intrusive as a result.\n\nWhile there are certainly ways it can improve, the Home Hub is a solid stab at a Google-branded smart display.\n\nIt\u2019s thoughtfully designed and does almost everything a device that\u2019s essentially a voice-activated tablet should do.\n\nThat\u2019s probably enough for average users and tecchies alike to want to introduce the device to their home.", "description": "Google is late to the game with its Home Hub, but the low price and AI features make it a great choice for controlling your home, showing pictures and even helping run your life.", "authors": ["Annie Palmer For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/25/18/5412846-0-image-a-4_1540488019021.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-25"}
