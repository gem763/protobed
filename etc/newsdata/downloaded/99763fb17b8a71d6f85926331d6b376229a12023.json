In all, 23 people were interviewed as part of the probe.\n\n\u201cJudge Murguia admitted that he engaged in these three forms of misconduct,\u201d said Chief Judge Timothy Tymkovich, in the Judicial Council\u2019s order. \u201cDuring the course of the investigation and proceedings, he also apologized for his behavior and assured the Judicial Council that he will not engage in this or any other inappropriate conduct in the future.

When initially confronted with the allegations, he did not fully disclose the extent of his misconduct. He tended to admit to allegations only when confronted with supporting documentary evidence.
