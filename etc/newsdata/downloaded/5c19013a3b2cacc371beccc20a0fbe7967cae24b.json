I\u2019m Mr. Wonderful from Shark Tank US. I\u2019ve been told Colombians are pretty hard negotiators, I guess we\u2019ll find out soon,\u201d O\u2019Leary said in a tweet.\n\n'SHARK TANK' STAR KEVIN O'LEARY'S ACCOUNT OF FATAL BOAT CRASH UNDER SCUITANY AS ABC, CO-STARS STAY QUIET\n\n\u201cHope you are ready for the new Sharks: Alejandra, Andrea, & Samy! Don\u2019t miss @sharktankcol new season starting Sept 6th on @sonychannella,\u201d he added.\n\nO\u2019Leary\u2019s seemingly tone-deaf tweet comes less than two weeks after the wealthy Canadian businessman and his wife, Linda, were reportedly involved in a fatal boating accident; the vessel they were traveling in collided with another boat on Lake Joseph, some 130 miles north of Toronto.\n\nThe accident left American Gary Poltash, 64, and Toronto native Suzana Brito, 48, dead. Poltash reportedly died at the scene, while Brito succumbed to her injuries in the hospital.\n\nO'Leary issued a statement following the accident.\n\n'SHARK TANK' STAR DESTROYS BERNIE SANDERS' $15 MINIMUM WAGE PLAN\n\n\u201cLate Saturday night I was a passenger in a boat that had a tragic collision with another craft that had no navigation lights on and then fled the scene of the accident,\u201d he said in a statement to TMZ after the news broke.\n\nNicknamed \u201cMr. Wonderful,\u201d O\u2019Leary claimed his wife was driving the boat at the time of the crash. She was administered a DUI test and passed. A third person, who has yet to be identified, was reportedly with O\u2019Leary and his wife. She was given stitches after being injured, the outlet reported at the time.\n\n\u201cOut of respect for the families who have lost loved ones and to fully support the ongoing investigation, I feel it is inappropriate to make further comments at this time. My thoughts are with all the families affected,\u201d O'Leary previously told the gossip site.\n\nThe stateside adaptation of \u201cShark Tank\u201d returns for its 11th season at the end of September. ABC has yet to return Fox News' requests for comment on the matter and has not issued a public statement about O'Leary.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPolice haven't charged anyone in connection with the crash.\n\nThe reality star had no further comment when reached by Fox News.\n\nFox News\u2019 Tyler McCarthy contributed to this report.", "description": "\u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary sent out an ultra-enthusiastic shout out to Colombia on Thursday \u2013 which is slated to premiere a variation of the popular reality TV show on Friday.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/RT-Kevin-O-Leary.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
