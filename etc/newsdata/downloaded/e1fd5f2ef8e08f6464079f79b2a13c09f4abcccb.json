Ikea is selling eight sizes of the blinds, ranging from 23 inches wide (for $129) to 48 inches (for $179). As my colleague Thomas Ricker notes in his review, the shades can\u2019t be cut: they\u2019re all 76 3\u20444 inches long, with the maximum length that they unroll to limited by the user as part of the setup process.\n\nWhile Ikea\u2019s website doesn\u2019t list all the models just yet, Reddit user HomeKit Hero has helpfully compiled a full list of the different sizes, model numbers, and prices for the US versions, listed below:\n\n23\u00d776 3\u20444\u2033 304.174.60 $129\n\n27\u00d776 3\u20444\u2033 104.174.61 $139\n\n30\u00d776 3\u20444\u2033 904.174.62 $149\n\n32\u00d776 3\u20444\u2033 704.174.63 $154\n\n34\u00d776 3\u20444\u2033 504.174.64 $159\n\n36\u00d776 3\u20444\u2033 204.174.65 $164\n\n38\u00d776 3\u20444\u2033 004.174.66 $169\n\n48\u00d776 3\u20444\u2033 504.174.59 $179\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up a set for yourself, you can check Ikea\u2019s website to see if your local store has any in stock, although some Reddit users have recommended calling the store to ask about the model number directly, as the website doesn\u2019t list all the sizes yet.\n\nAccording to Thomas, Ikea\u2019s smart blinds are one of the best options around for adding motorized shades to your home, given the relatively low cost compared to other options and simple setup process. That said, there are still some frustrating software quirks, including the lack of promised Alexa and HomeKit support that Ikea still says is coming later this year.", "description": "Ikea\u2019s new smart blinds are finally making their way to the US after a delay earlier this year, but they only seem to be available in retail locations for now, with online purchases still listed as \"not available.\"", "authors": ["Chaim Gartenberg", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YCbcpfKzqvfa4JnogFNJvbhh9bo=/0x204:2040x1272/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19252300/verge_IMG_9033_2040pxl.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
