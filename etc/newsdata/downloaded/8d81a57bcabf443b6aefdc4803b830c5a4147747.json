But a severe recession may be his undoing. And even before economic catastrophe strikes, the public may begin paying more attention to his aberrations \u2014 and to contagious new counter-narratives that crowd out his own.\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s Nobel-winning economist Robert Shiller explaining in an editorial for the Guardian published on Monday how a downturn in the economy could be what finally marks the ruin of Trump\u2019s turbulent presidency.\n\n\u201cDuring a recession, people pull back and reassess their views. Consumers spend less, avoiding purchases that can be postponed: a new car, home renovations and expensive holidays,\u201d Shiller continued. \u201cBusinesses spend less on new factories and equipment, and put off recruiting.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cpublic narrative\u201d he was referring to is Trump\u2019s lifetime pursuit of putting his glam life on display for everybody to see and aspire to \u2014 fancy cars, beautiful women, private jets, gold toilets. Look at me, I\u2019m rich and you can be, too!\n\nThat, Shiller says, has less appeal when the economy goes belly up.\n\n\u201cNow that Trump has established a contagious narrative, he continues to live out his TV show persona,\u201d he wrote, adding that this approach is nothing new. In fact, it dates back thousands of years. He quoted the ancient cynic Lucian of Samosata, who told would-be leaders of the era how to exploit \u201cthe power narrative\u201d:\n\nIn your private life, be resolved to do anything and everything, to dice, to drink deep, to live high and keep mistresses, or at all events to boast of it even if you do not do it, telling everyone about it and showing notes that purport to be written by women. You must aim to be elegant, you know, and take pains to create the impression that women are devoted to you. This also will be set down to the credit of your rhetoric by the public, who will infer from it that your fame extends even to the women\u2019s quarters.\n\nThis has worked for Trump during his presidency, Shiller says, but only because the economy has been exceptionally strong, with the U.S. expansion the longest on record going back to the 1850s.\n\n\u201cSo far, with his flashy lifestyle, Trump has been a resounding inspiration to many consumers and investors,\u201d Shiller wrote. \u201cBut motivational speakers often end up repelling the very people they once inspired.\u201d\n\nAn ailing stock market certainly won\u2019t help Trump\u2019s chances in 2020, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.08% has been all over the place lately. On Tuesday, the blue-chip index was down more than 300 points.", "description": "Robert Shiller explains in an editorial for the Guardian published on Monday how a downturn in the economy could be what finally marks the ruin of Donald...", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ564_trump_MG_20190903095852.jpg"}
