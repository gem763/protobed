I also found them very credible,\u201d he said.\n\nIntelligence committee members remained mum on details about what they read in the whistleblower complaint, which remains behind closed doors, but Rep. Eric Swalwell said it gave them new leads and witnesses to pursue.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint is reportedly tied to allegations that President Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate the business dealings of Democratic frontrunner Joseph R. Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden.\n\nPresident Trump released on Wednesday a transcript of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, where he did bring up Mr. Biden, but did not mention military aid \u2014 with Democrats claiming vindication and Republicans arguing innocence.\n\nThe allegations sparked a tidal wave of longtime impeachment holdouts to come forward and prompted Mrs. Pelosi to launch an official impeachment investigation.\n\nMembers would not confirm if the complaint was actually connected to the allegations regarding Ukraine, though it appeared to fail to move the needle on how members viewed the situation.\n\nDemocrats said it only reaffirmed their position to have an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cIt reinforced our concerns,\u201d Illinois Democrat Rep. Mike Quigley said, describing it as \u201cdisturbing\u201d and \u201calarming.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, however, did not express serious concern.\n\nGOP Rep. John Ratcliffe said the complaint raised questions and included information beyond the transcript, but said it \u201cabsolutely\u201d did not change his mind on impeachment.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire is expected to testify before the committee on Thursday, and lawmakers are trying to secure a closed-door testimony from the whistleblower this week as well.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
