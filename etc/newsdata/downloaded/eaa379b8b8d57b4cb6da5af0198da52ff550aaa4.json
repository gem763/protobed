It said Mr. McCabe lied to fellow agents and cast blame on colleagues for his orchestrated press leak.\n\nHis legal team lost an appeal to Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen to avert criminal charges that may come out of the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the District of Columbia. Defense attorney Michael R. Bromwich floated an unconfirmed rumor that the grand jury refused to indict.\n\nMeantime, Mr. McCabe adamantly rejects the inspector general\u2019s conclusions and is suing the Justice Department.\n\nWhat did Mr. McCabe do that resulted in his firing in March 2018, a few days short of full retirement, and prompted U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu to weigh criminal charges?\n\nHere is what Inspector General Michael Horowitz wrote:\n\nOn Aug. 12, 2016, Mr. McCabe received a phone call from the principal associate deputy attorney general in the Obama Justice Department. The inspector general didn\u2019t name the official. Matthew Axelrod, who left Justice shortly after President Trump took office, at the time was associate deputy under Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates.\n\nThe call was heated. Mr. Axelrod wanted to know why agents in New York during a presidential election were aggressively investigating the Clinton Foundation, a family charity taking in millions of dollars from foreign sources. The Democratic nominee was Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn October, The Wall Street Journal reported on huge campaign donations from a political action committee controlled by then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who is closely tied to the Clintons. The beneficiary was the campaign of Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife, who made an unsuccessful run for state Senate in 2015.\n\nWashington\u2019s chattering class, upon hearing the McCabe story, started questioning FBI objectivity. In July 2016, FBI Director James B. Comey called Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email handling of classified information \u201cextremely careless\u201d but not illegal.\n\nMr. McCabe launched his own secretive media campaign to counter the bad press. He authorized his counsel, Lisa Page, and a public relations official to contact Devlin Barrett, the Wall Street Journal reporter who wrote the Clinton cash story.\n\n\u201cAre you in with WSJ now,\u201d Mr. McCabe texted to Ms. Page on Oct. 27.\n\nOn a second call with Mr. Barrett, Ms. Page filled in the reporter on the Aug. 12 McCabe phone call with Mr. Axelrod.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re done,\u201d she texted Mr. McCabe.\n\nShe told Mr. Barrett of the McCabe pushback to show that the deputy was the honest, unbiased G-man the public demanded. On Oct. 30, a Journal story appeared with the headline \u201cFBI Justice Feud in Clinton Probe.\u201d\n\nThe story said, in part: \u201cAccording to a person familiar with the probes, on Aug. 12, a senior Justice Department official called Mr. McCabe to voice his displeasure at finding that New York FBI agents were still openly pursuing the Clinton Foundation probe during the election season. Mr. McCabe said agents still had the authority to pursue the issue as long as they didn\u2019t use overt methods requiring Justice Department approvals.\n\n\u201c\u2018Are you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?\u2019 Mr. McCabe asked, according to people familiar with the conversation. After a pause, the official replied \u2018Of course not,\u2019 these people said.\u201d\n\nThe McCabe media strategy not only disclosed the internal phone call but also marked the first time the government was confirming an FBI investigation into the billion-dollar Clinton Foundation.\n\nMr. McCabe went further than authorizing the leak. The day the story was published, he telephoned FBI executives at the Washington and New York field offices and blamed his colleagues for the Oct. 30 story.\n\n\u201cGet this house in order,\u201d Mr. McCabe said. He later told investigators he didn\u2019t recall making the calls.\n\nThe next day, Mr. Comey convened a high-level meeting to address press leaks. Mr. McCabe later told investigators that he informed the FBI chief about the leaks and Mr. Comey approved. Mr. Comey said no such conversation took place.\n\nMr. McCabe \u201cdefinitely did not tell me that he authorized,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me, boss,\u201d Mr. Comey quoted his No. 2 as saying.\n\nMr. McCabe also attempted to cast blame in the circle of managers around him and said the fact that Ms. Page was talking to Mr. Barrett was no secret.\n\nIn sum, Mr. McCabe attempted to blame Mr. Comey, his field office managers and colleagues around him.\n\nMay 2017 was a momentous month for FBI headquarters: Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein named Robert Mueller as special counsel for the Trump-Russia election investigation, and Mr. McCabe, now acting director, opened a probe targeting the president as a possible Russian agent. Mr. Mueller\u2019s final report, released in March, showed no evidence that Mr. Trump was an agent.\n\nIn the background, FBI internal affairs already was investigating press leaks and added the Oct. 30 Journal story to the mix. During the May turmoil, the inquiry took two FBI internal affairs agents to Mr. McCabe\u2019s seventh-floor office at headquarters.\n\nThe agents determined that the acting FBI director\u2019s story didn\u2019t add up and that it was best to move the politically sensitive investigation outside the FBI chain of command to the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, Mr. Horowitz.\n\nMr. Horowitz finished his report in February 2018. A month later, with new FBI Director Christopher A. Wray in place, Mr. McCabe was fired based on the inspector general\u2019s findings. The report was released to the public in April.\n\nIG: How Mr. McCabe was untruthful\n\nMr. Horowitz depicted Mr. McCabe as a manipulative bureaucrat willing to lie about his boss and those around him. According to the inspector general, he:\n\n\u2981 Told Mr. Comey on Oct. 31, 2016, that he didn\u2019t approve the leak.\n\n\u2981 Denied to FBI agents on May 9, 2017, under oath that he had authorized the October 2016 leak.\n\n\u2981 Told the inspector general in July 28, 2017, that he was not aware that Ms. Page was authorized to leak to The Journal.\n\n\u2981 Told the inspector general on Nov. 29, 2017, under oath three alleged lies: He acknowledged that he had authorized the leak and contended that he never issued a denial to FBI internal affairs on May 9; he told Mr. Comey that he, Mr. McCabe, had approved the leak; and he said FBI internal affairs agents asked him about the Journal disclosure only as an afterthought as they were leaving his office.\n\nOne of the agents who interviewed Mr. McCabe in May 2017 was not happy that his boss spread blame to others for something the deputy director had done.\n\nThe agent told the inspector general: \u201cI remember saying to him, at, I said, sir, you understand that we put a lot of work into this based on what you\u2019ve told us. I mean, and I even said, long nights and weekends working on this, trying to find out who amongst your ranks of trusted people would, would do something like that. And he kind of just looked down, kind of nodded, and said, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\u201d\n\nMcCabe counterattack\n\nMr. McCabe rejects the inspector general\u2019s conclusions. He filed suit last month in U.S. District Court alleging that the Trump Justice Department illegally fired him in retaliation for pursuing the Russia investigation.\n\n\u201cIts investigative conclusions are incorrect, partly because the report relies on material mischaracterizations and omissions, including the report\u2019s failure to reference any testimony by exculpatory witnesses,\u201d McCabe attorneys contend.\n\n\u201c[Mr. McCabe] served the FBI with fidelity, bravery, and integrity for more than 21 years, defending the United States against enemies both foreign and domestic,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nIn contrast, Mr. McCabe\u2019s legal team depicts Mr. Trump as an out-of-control chief executive trying to bully the Justice Department into firing people he doesn\u2019t like.\n\n\u201cIt was Trump\u2019s unconstitutional plan and scheme to discredit and remove DOJ and FBI employees who were deemed to be his partisan opponents because they were not politically loyal to him,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nMr. McCabe states that to please Mr. Trump, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Mr. Wray fast-tracked the disciplinary process so Mr. McCabe could be fired the day of his planned retirement, denying him full retirement benefits.\n\nMr. McCabe tells of one encounter with Mr. Trump during the search for a Comey replacement. Mr. Trump wanted to know how he voted in the presidential election. Mr. McCabe says he didn\u2019t cast a vote for president in 2016.\n\n\u201cNo superior had ever asked Plaintiff about his voting history in his entire career as a public servant,\u201d the complaint says. \u201cBased on Trump\u2019s tone of voice and body language, Plaintiff understood the question as a threat to his employment, not withstanding his civil service protections, and responded by saying that he \u2018always played it right down the middle.\u2019 Trump was visibly displeased by Plaintiff\u2019s answer.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
