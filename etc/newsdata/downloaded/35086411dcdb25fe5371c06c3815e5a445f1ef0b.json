In a new series, we\u2019re focusing on one story at a time, honoring the many different ways babies come into the world and the beauty of every family\u2019s story.\n\nThis week, we\u2019re hearing from Ashlee Wilkenson, 29, who had photographer Rebecca Walsh (working for Denver-based birth photographer Monet Nicole) shoot the birth of her fifth baby, at home in Colorado.\n\nIn her own words, Wilkenson describes how unpredictable childbirth can be, no matter how many times you\u2019ve been through it.\n\nI have five children. My eldest is 6 years old, and then I\u2019ve had four babies in the last four years. It\u2019s been interesting!\n\nI had my first baby in a hospital, and then all of my deliveries after have been home births. With my first, I labored for maybe 24 hours and I think it would have taken longer if I hadn\u2019t been given Pitocin. Then with my second, I had probably two hours of active labor. My third was maybe three? My fourth was 14 hours long and extremely painful from the beginning.\n\nBecause of that, I went into my most recent birth knowing to expect the unexpected, but also with a clear sense of what I hoped for, if possible. I wanted my husband to catch the baby. And it was really important for me to try and have some peace and quiet right after the baby was born.\n\nI was fully expecting to go to 41 weeks, because that\u2019s what happened with my first and my third, but I\u2019d also been feeling pretty labor-ish from 36 weeks onward.\n\nAt 39 weeks, I went to bed like usual and then woke up maybe 45 minutes later to a giant contraction and tons of pressure. I felt like the baby was right there.\n\nI do have a history of some really fast labors, but I\u2019ve also had some long ones, so I felt like I didn\u2019t know what was happening. I woke my husband up and he was kind of like: \u201cAre you going to have a baby right now?\u201d My contractions were three minutes apart. Right when he asked, I had a contraction hit and I started shaking. I thought, \u201cOh, my goodness, did I basically wake up in transition?\u201d\n\nHe called the midwife right away, and told her I was shaking. She kind of said: \u201cOK, here is how you catch a baby.\u201d My husband is military \u2014 he\u2019s an engineer \u2014 so he was really calm. I have some medical experience as an EMT and I\u2019m a doula. Because I\u2019ve had some fast labors before, we\u2019d talked with my midwife about what to do if things went quickly. So we had this moment of prepping to do this on our own. But thankfully, my midwife \u2014 who is about 45 minutes away \u2014 got there in time and we didn\u2019t have to.\n\nMy contractions were super close together and I remember thinking to myself, \u201cI need them to slow down, because I cannot do this.\u201d I was still preparing myself for the idea of doing this for another 14 hours after my last labor, even though everyone else seemed to understand how close I was.\n\nI hopped in the bath. I was still thinking I was just in there to slow my contractions down, and my husband and midwife were kind of like, \u201cSure, Ash, whatever you say.\u201d In the water, things did space out a bit, but then the contractions got really intense again. And it was clear they weren\u2019t dilation contractions. They were get-the-baby-out contractions.\n\nI got out of the tub, and he was born within a contraction and a half. My husband was able to catch him, and then I just held him and looked at him for a while.\n\nYes, I had my baby on the bathroom floor. After a while, I was able to stand up and walk over to the bed holding him. It was really peaceful.\n\nHe\u2019s such a chill baby. I love that I can see it in these photos, even though he has that little pout face. He has such a sweet demeanor, and he has had it since the very beginning.\n\nThe kids slept through the whole thing. We had a friend here who was planning to watch them if we needed it, and we were open to them coming in if they wanted to \u2014 or staying away if that\u2019s what they preferred. But they ended up waking up maybe four hours after the baby was born.\n\nThey were excited to say \u201chi\u201d to the baby, but then they wanted to go to my sister\u2019s so they just kind of took off. I got a nap.\n\nNow that I have done this five times, I have definitely learned to expect the unexpected and to be OK if absolutely nothing seems to be going the way it\u2019s \u201csupposed\u201d to go. It\u2019s kind of like having so many kids close together. Sometimes we\u2019re like, \u201cOh, my goodness, this is crazy!\u201d But our hearts are full.", "description": "Ashlee Wilkenson has had five kiddos, and five very different birth experiences.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9cc7db2100003107ac5c1e.jpeg?cache=pbLEMlV70g&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
