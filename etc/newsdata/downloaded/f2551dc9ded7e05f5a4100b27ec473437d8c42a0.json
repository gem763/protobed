I found it so offensive. I am mixed race, half Arabic and half English.\n\n\"I took a picture of the painting and showed it to my black friends. They were really offended by it and felt it was racist and couldn't see why Nando's would use such a painting in one of its restaurants.\"\n\nHe added: \"We sent a complaint to Nando's and they did respond to us to apologise and to try offer an explanation. But we still don't know what the hidden message is behind the artwork.\"\n\n(Image: Birmingham Live WS)\n\nA Nando\u2019s spokesman said it had removed the painting following the complaints and apologised for any misinterpretation.\n\nHe said: \"As a proudly South African brand we are the biggest collectors of Southern African art in the world and every Nando\u2019s restaurant displays original artworks from artists based in our homeland.\n\n\"Often these works depict scenes from South Africa\u2019s history or comment on the current social situations there.\n\n(Image: Birmingham Live WS)\n\n\"In this instance artist, Khaya Sineyile, from the New Crossroads township in Nyanga, Cape Town, takes issue with the far-reaching effects of social inequality in South Africa.\n\n\"Using common household objects in juxtaposition with his subjects Khaya aims to create discussion around issues often ignored.\n\n\"We understand art is subjective and without context the work could be misinterpreted, we have apologised for any offence this artwork might have caused.\"", "description": "The popular fast food chain has since removed the artwork from its Birmingham branch and apologised after visitors including Wayne Yafai, 33, branded it \"offensive\"", "authors": ["Andy Richardson", "Amber Hicks", "Image", "Sopa Images Lightrocket Via Gett", "Birmingham Live Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20585815.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1113_A-branch-of-Nandos-is-seen-in-central-London-Nandos-is-a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
