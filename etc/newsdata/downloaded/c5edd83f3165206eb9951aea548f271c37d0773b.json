'Since we can't bring the soil to the mole, maybe we can bring the mole to the soil by pinning it in the hole.'\n\nOver the last few months, the team used a scoop (pictured) on the robotic arm to push and poke at the soil, hoping it would collapse the soil. But the arm can't use its full strength to push\n\nINSIGHT'S THREE KEY INSTRUMENTS The lander that could reveal how Earth was formed Three key instruments will allow the InSight lander to 'take the pulse' of the red planet: Seismometer : The InSight lander carries a seismometer , SEIS, that listens to the pulse of Mars. The seismometer records the waves traveling through the interior structure of a planet. Studying seismic waves tells us what might be creating the waves. On Mars, scientists suspect that the culprits may be marsquakes, or meteorites striking the surface. Heat probe: InSight's heat flow probe, HP3, burrows deeper than any other scoops, drills or probes on Mars before it. It will investigate how much heat is still flowing out of Mars. Radio antennas: Like Earth, Mars wobbles a little as it rotates around its axis. To study this, two radio antennas, part of the RISE instrument, track the location of the lander very precisely. This helps scientists test the planet's reflexes and tells them how the deep interior structure affects the planet's motion around the Sun.\n\nInSight has been using a scoop on its robotic arm of the past few months with the hopes of moving more soil, but the arm is unable to use its full strength with the attachment.\n\nOver the last few months, the team used a scoop on the robotic arm to push and poke at the soil, hoping it would collapse the soil. But the arm can't use its full strength to push.\n\n'We're asking the arm to punch above its weight,' said Ashitey Trebi-Ollennu, the lead arm engineer at JPL.\n\n'The arm can't push the soil the way a person can.\n\n'This would be easier if it could, but that's just not the arm we have.'", "description": "NASA's InSight rover has provided the American space agency with weather reports, images and other interesting findings on Mars - but has struggled to probe its surface.", "authors": ["Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/23/19318240-0-image-a-42_1570229018263.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
