Experts says it has undergone one of the most dramatic intensifications of any tropical cyclone since records began.\n\nThe storm is many times the dimensions of Typhoon Faxai, which brought Tokyo to a standstill last month, left three dead and a million homes without power.\n\nNow Townsend \u2013 whose side must beat Japan to claim a place in the quarter-finals \u2013 is waiting to hear what move the tournament organisers will take.\n\n\u201cI checked the weather app (on Wednesday morning), about eight hours ago, and it did look like it was heading into Tokyo this weekend, unless it has changed since then,\u201d the Dark Blues head coach said after his side\u2019s rout of Russia.\n\n\u201cIt is a few days away and it could miss the Tokyo area, or it could still go there and obviously we\u2019ll be getting updates from World Rugby in the next two days as to what the contingencies are.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had contact to say there will be an update over the next 24 to 48 hours, so I\u2019m sure that alternative venues and arrangements are being looked at not just for our game but the other games that could be affected by it. England and France play in the same stadium the night before.\n\n\u201cI know it was getting looked at for the Ireland game as well when the forecast was that it was going to Fukuoka.\u201d\n\nThe Scots have just four days to prepare for their Brave Blossoms showdown and a change of venue would throw those plans into chaos.\n\nBut Townsend was delighted to see his team run in nine tries against the Russians to secure the bonus point which puts them in control of their own destiny.\n\nGeorge Horne became the first Scottish scrum-half to score a Test hat-trick, Adam Hastings grabbed a double while George Turner, Tommy Seymour, John Barclay and Stuart McInally also crossed and Scotland secured their first back-to-back clean sheets for 55 years.\n\nTownsend, whose side lost their opener to Ireland before kick-starting their campaign with a 34-0 win over Samoa, said: \u201cCredit to the players for that, to keep going hard in defence. In the last two games our forwards have delivered in a number of areas, especially around the set-piece.\n\n\u201cRussia had an excellent scrum and maul and are very physical, but I thought our scrum was excellent. Straight away we put them under pressure and our maul got better. We forced mistakes at their lineout so that was good to see.\n\n\u201cYou look at getting the bonus point, first of all. If we hadn\u2019t got that then Sunday would have been even more difficult.\n\nDuncan Taylor picked up a thumb injury against Russia (Christophe Ena/AP)\n\n\u201cThe four-day turnaround was always in the schedule. We have thought about selection and how we manage the load of our players. We have thought about how we best approach the next few days.\n\n\u201cIt is a challenge and we know Japan have had a good rest going into the game \u2013 they have had good rests for all their games \u2013 but we\u2019ve known that would be the case.\u201d\n\nThe only negative from the victory was the thumb injury picked up by Duncan Taylor, who will be assessed over the coming days.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get an update in Duncan Taylor, who is our only concern,\u201d Townsend added. \u201cHe\u2019s got a thumb injury, so he\u2019s getting an X-ray now. He may require other imaging as well if the X-ray doesn\u2019t give us the full details. But he\u2019s the only one we\u2019ve got concerns about.\n\n\u201cIt is important that we recover well (on Thursday), then do what we can over the next few days to be in the best condition possible to play our best rugby on Sunday.\u201d", "description": "World Rugby is set to make an announcement on Thursday outlining its contingency plans for Typhoon Hagibis.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/12/wire-19488938-1570621761-937_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
