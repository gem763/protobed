The U.S. \u201ctroop withdrawal from northern Syria constitutes another abrupt and destabilizing foreign policy move by the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis damages U.S. credibility and stability in the entire region. The planned Turkish offensive is contrary to international law and further militarizes the Kurdish conflict,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cRenewed armed hostilities in the northeast will not only exacerbate civilian suffering and lead to massive displacement but will also risk severely undermining current political efforts,\u201d European Commission spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic told reporters Monday, stopping short of mentioning President Trump by name.\n\nWhile defending the withdrawal decision, Trump lashed out at European allies early Monday, taking aim at their reluctance to repatriate citizens who went to fight for the Islamic State in Syria and now are imprisoned in Kurdish-controlled camps near the Syrian border.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEurope did not want them back, they said you keep them USA,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cI said \u2018NO, we did you a great favor and now you want us to hold them in U.S. prisons at tremendous cost. They are yours for trials.\u2019\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEuropean politicians have been hesitant to bring back people who might then pose a terrorism threat. And European leaders fear their national courts won\u2019t be able to convict former fighters because of a lack of evidence or the inapplicability of domestic laws.\n\n\u201cThe Europeans especially, and the international community more broadly, have shirked this responsibility,\u201d said Tobias Schneider, a research fellow with the Berlin-based Global Public Policy Institute.\n\nAD\n\nIn Paris and Berlin on Monday, officials disputed Trump\u2019s characterization and argued that a U.S. withdrawal \u2014 along with a Turkish offensive on Kurdish forces \u2014 could permit former Islamic State fighters to continue terrorist activities.\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Hardt, foreign policy spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative parliamentary bloc, rejected Trump\u2019s criticism, saying: \u201cI consider the president\u2019s analysis to be wrong. Of course, Germany is ready to take responsibility for Islamic State fighters from Germany.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTerrorist fighters in detention, including those of foreign nationality, should be tried where they committed their crimes,\u201d the French Foreign Ministry statement said. \u201cThis judgment and their safe detention in northeastern Syria is also a security imperative to prevent them from reinforcing the ranks of terrorist groups.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn Russia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov expressed skepticism about whether the United States would fully withdraw. \u201cAfter all, you should rely on statements made by Washington officials to begin with and draw your conclusions from official statements,\u201d he said, referring to the sometimes contradictory assessments of Syria policy offered by Trump and his subordinates.\n\n\u201cIt is important to avoid any action which may create impediments to the Syrian settlement process,\u201d Peskov added when asked by reporters if he expected the Syrian Kurds to reach out to Damascus in advance of any Turkish military operation.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also weighed in, calling the United States \u201can irrelevant occupier\u201d in Syria and saying it was \u201cfutile to seek its permission or rely on it for security.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIran and Russia support the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad, which has been battling an array of forces fighting under various banners since 2011. More than half a million people have been killed in the brutal conflict, rights groups have estimated, and millions of others have fled their homes.\n\n\u201cIf we have a catastrophic, disorganized, chaotic return of [Islamic State] returnees because the Kurds will no longer be in a position to hold them, or no longer feel an obligation to hold them, that of course will make Mr. Trump a little more unpopular still,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, a former French presidential national security adviser.\n\n\u201cThis guy has used this as a threat, and then he executes that threat. It\u2019s an absolutely dastardly thing to do.\u201d\n\nNoack reported from Munich.
