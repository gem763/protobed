It\u2019s about changing how you feel flying with us,\u201d United CEO Oscar Munoz said.\n\nHe highlighted the transformation called the \u201cNew Spirit of United,\u201d which started in 2016 with a listening tour talking to employees and customers. Munoz says the turning point came when a flight attendant told him,\u201dI am just tired of always saying sorry.\u201d\n\nMunoz took responsibility for mistakes like the incident when a passenger was physically dragged off an overbooked flight in 2017. Last June, Munoz acknowledged that for passengers on most airlines, flying has become stressful saying, \u201cBy the time you sit on one of our aircraft, you\u2019re just pissed at the world.\u201d\n\nOscar Munoz, CEO of United Airlines, discusses his vision for the company, in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., March 21, 2018.

The airline\u2019s last earnings report surpassed Wall Street\u2019s expectations, posting adjusted net income of $1 billion. Over the last 52 weeks, United stock (UAL) is up almost 10% \u2014 outperforming competitors like Delta (DAL), American Airlines (AAL), and Southwest Airlines (LUV).\n\nUnited Airlines President Scott Kirby told Yahoo Finance\u2019s Adam Shapiro, \u201cWe\u2019ve got all the building blocks in place. The next phase is to get customers to choose to fly United.\u201d\n\nOne of the things United has done is upgrade its mobile app to help communicate better with passengers, \u201cTo tell customers in language they can understand what\u2019s going on,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cIf there is a flight delay, if there is weather explaining why, because if you take that uncertainty out, it really helps to calm people down,\u201d Kirby added.\n\nKeeping stock flying high\n\nThe airline has committed to growing capacity 4% to 6% year over year through 2020, but analysts like Jim Corridore at CFRA Research worry the added capacity will challenge United\u2019s ability to control key metrics like cost per available seat mile (CASM) and (PRASM) passenger revenue per available seat mile. \u201cHow are you going to be able to continue to grow unit revenues while adding capacity and defending your market share?\u201d Corridore asked.\n\nUnited expects to grow the average number of seats per departure 10% to 15% by 2025, something Kirby says is a \u201chuge tailwind\u201d for CASM.\n\n\u201cIf we add a 737 and let\u2019s say we have 166 seats on it and we replace a 50 seater with 50 seats on it, everyone of those departures is 116 more seats and the cost per seat on a 737 is a lot less per seat than on a 50 seat airplane,\u201d Kirby said.\n\nMany of the costs are fixed Kirby points out, adding, \u201cYou get to spread those fixed costs out over more seats.\u201d\n\nBut added capacity may hit all airlines next year if Boeing\u2019s 737 Max is allowed to return to the skies. The extra seats could force airlines to cut prices to lure passengers to fill those empty seats. Corridore says United needs \u201cto be careful at how quickly they grow capacity and continue to utilize their hub strength.\u201d\n\nKirby says, \u201cWe\u2019ve increasingly seen as we\u2019ve invested in the customer experience, we\u2019ve invested in the customer product that customers are choosing to fly United Airlines. So we are able to outperform even in a difficult macro environment because of the investments we are making the improved operation and customer experience that are causing people to choose to fly United Airlines,\u201d he said.\n\nAdam Shapiro is co-anchor of Yahoo Finance On the Move.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "United airlines stock is outperforming other airlines after it launched its flight 2020 plan, with a new emphasis on roomier planes and better passenger experiences.", "authors": ["Adam Shapiro"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/otRh_KLQxUADmu7Mt9bVKw--~B/aD0xOTIwO3c9Mjg5MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/b3392b70-f730-11e9-b7f9-43fe6c4cd97f", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
