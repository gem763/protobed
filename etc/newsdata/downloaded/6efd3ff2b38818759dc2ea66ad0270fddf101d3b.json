We\u2019d hardly seen each other that week, and had only exchanged brief emails about a forthcoming event.\n\nBut there was no one there. \u2018What\u2019s up?\u2019 I asked.\n\n\u2018You didn\u2019t put a kiss on the end of your email!\u2019 she blustered, outraged by my rudeness and genuinely more than slightly upset. \u2018So, have you got the HUMP with me?\u2019\n\nI should have known. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve been caught neglecting the basic rule of 21st Century office politics: send kisses with everything, even to people you barely know and wouldn\u2019t be caught dead kissing in real life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI find the whole thing unnecessarily stressful. Here\u2019s a thought \u2013 how about an amnesty? We all forgo (virtual) kisses for a month\u2026 and we all learn to use full stops properly while we\u2019re at it.\n\nOver the years I\u2019ve worked myself into quite a state over the whole affair. Embarrassed by my own lack of kissiness, but unwilling to capitulate, I have fallen into the \u2018end with an emoji\u2019 trap whereby any message that could fall prey to the \u2018x\u2019 gets terminated with a yellow smiley face \u2013 just so as not to offend.\n\nI forgot to put an \u2018x\u2019 at the end of a message to my husband last month and he came home with a bunch of flowers, fearing he was in the dog house. And my oldest friend admitted she perceived me as \u2018rude\u2019 when I omitted an \u2018x\u2019 from a few flippant exchanges.\n\nFull stops are seen as abrupt and offensive \u2013 the punctuation equivalent of a sneer or upturned nose.\n\nIf you fail to punctuate a text message with at least one \u2018x\u2019, you are a pariah who fails to acknowledge the unspoken rules of civility. If you forget to insert one when signing off on an email, you might as well have handed the contract to the competition.\n\nIn the media industry, you can\u2019t go an hour without 17 emails ending with an \u2018x\u2019 landing in your inbox. The subjects are bland, the requests inane, often the writer is a total stranger, yet they\u2019re all signed off with a gesture of affection reserved only for those I\u2019m willing to share spit with.\n\nIf somebody puts a kiss at the end of their first email, you are likely to respond with one. If you later omit the kiss, they may worry that there is a sinister reason\n\nWhy do we do it? Behavioural psychologist Jo Hemmings says the trend is down to a combination of etiquette, desire to please, and habit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We tend to respond to people in the way they approach us \u2013 it feels polite and endears us to them, and them to us,\u2019 she explains. \u2018It establishes a bond early on in a relationship, be it personal or professional.\n\n\u2018If somebody puts a kiss at the end of their first email, you are likely to respond with one. If you later omit the kiss, they may worry that there is a sinister reason, rather than just assuming you were in a rush.\u2019\n\nI waste time daily wondering how many kisses to use and when. It\u2019s time consuming, confusing, and a drain on my emotions.\n\nAnd while this conundrum continues to consume me, and amuse me, when it comes to personal relationships in the workplace it can become very problematic. Send a kiss to the wrong person and you could be accused of inappropriate advances, or simply be seen as a bit ditsy \u2013 not the sort of impression one wants to create when courting a new client.\n\nThe truth is, I just don\u2019t want to send an empty expression of affection to someone I hardly know every time we interact. We don\u2019t all go around kissing each other in real life, so why do it in typeface?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019d rather save kisses for when I mean it. For ending an affectionate note, for following my name in a card to someone I care about, or for expressing actual emotion when discussing something serious. Not for ending an email about copywriting a company\u2019s website.\n\nMy cross co-worker, by the way, was pacified by my lengthy explanation of why I just don\u2019t \u2018do\u2019 kisses.\n\n\u2018It is a bit silly,\u2019 she conceded, before spontaneously throwing her arms around me in a big, reassuring hug.\n\nOver-zealous and unwanted physical gestures in public places?
