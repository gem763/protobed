Furthermore, as they did not believe that these uncertainties would derail the expansion, they did not see further policy accommodation as needed at this time.\"\n\nSeveral policymakers noted that statistical models suggested the likelihood of a recession over the medium term had increased in recent months and a number warned that the labour market coming into 2019 may have been less strong than previously thought, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics preliminary revisions.\n\nThe Fed has lowered borrowing costs twice this year after having raised interest rates nine times since 2015 and the minutes tally with projections that accompanied the September statement, which showed discord among policymakers on the path forward.\n\nSeven of the Fed's 17 policymakers last month indicated they forecast one more rate cut this year. Five policymakers did not see any more cuts needed and the other five projected a rate rise by end of 2019. Investors overwhelmingly expect another rate cut at the next meeting on October 29-30.\n\nFed chairman Jerome Powell and some other policymakers are in the camp that view rate cuts that have occurred as necessary insurance in order to keep the longest US economic expansion on record going.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, Powell flagged openness to more rate cuts to mitigate against such risks, repeating that the central bank will act \"as appropriate\".\n\nBut others, such as Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren and Kansas City Fed president Esther George, do not see the need for rate cuts when the economy is growing moderately and unemployment is near a 50-year low.\n\nThe Fed has been near-continuously pilloried in recent months by President Donald Trump who called them \"boneheads\" ahead of the September meeting for not cutting interest rates more. On Wednesday Trump criticised the central bank again. \"The USA is doing great despite the Fed!\" he tweeted.\n\nSince the meeting, economic data has increased fears that trade tensions are spilling over to the broader economy. US manufacturing activity tumbled to a more than 10-year low and service sector activity fell to a three-year low in September.\n\nConsumer spending, which has been driving US growth, has also begun to moderate.\n\nElsewhere in the minutes, policymakers discussed recent volatility in US short-term funding markets. Rates in the $US2.2 trillion market for repurchase agreements, a key measure of liquidity, spiked to 10 per cent on September 17 to levels not seen since the height of the global financial crisis in 2008 as demand for overnight cash from companies, banks and other borrowers exceeded supply.\n\nIn order to calm markets, the New York Fed has since been holding daily repo operations to inject extra cash into the system and will do so through November 4 in order to help maintain the federal funds rate within its current target range.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome investors and former Fed officials have been calling on the central bank to deliver a long-term fix, such as creating a standing repo facility, which would allow firms to borrow cash as needed at a fixed rate, or expanding the Fed's balance sheet.\n\nAt the September meeting, participants agreed that any growth in the balance sheet \"should be clearly distinguished from past large-scale asset purchase programs\" and several suggested further discussion on establishing a standing repo facility.\n\nPowell said on Tuesday the Fed would \"soon announce measures to add to the supply of reserves over time\" and emphasised allowing the balance sheet to grow again should not be read as an effort to stimulate the economy, but rather to meet the public's demand for cash and bank demand for reserves.\n\nReuters", "description": "The September decision to cut interest rates was easy; future decisions are set to be more contentious it appears.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_26/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4a0f6f565e7a04846b243b87872dd6b2e7bca199", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
