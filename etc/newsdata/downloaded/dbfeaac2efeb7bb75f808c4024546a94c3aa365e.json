The singer, who has held performances bashing Museveni's government, said the show would go on despite the ban.\n\nWine, who said police and military had surrounded his home to prevent him from holding the show, escaped them on a motorbike to loud cheers from his fans and supporters. The concert did not hold but Wine addressed his supporters at a briefing instead.\n\n\"We are supposed to be celebrating Independence but Ugandans have nothing to celebrate,\" Wine told reporters after the incident.\n\n'People power'\n\nWine, who is riding on a revolutionary movement called the \"People Power\" to clinch the presidential seat, accused the government of intimidating his supporters.\n\n\"President Museveni is very scared of the ideas that we represent, He believes by blocking us from communication, by stopping us from enjoying our rights, he is going to disempower us, he is going to demotivate us,\" Wine said at the conference.\n\nCNN has contacted Museveni's media aide for comment but has yet to receive a response to Wine's comments.\n\nThe 37-year-old reggae star is running for president in the country's 2021 elections. His star power has attracted a large following among young Ugandans, who make up more than half of the country's population\n\nWine (real name Robert Kyagulayi ) entered the political sphere in Uganda in 2017 and won his parliamentary seat the same year. The MP has been rallying opposition and dissents to his side and has even led a protest against some government policies.", "description": "Ugandan musician Bobi Wine has issued a defiant warning to the country's longtime President Yoweri Museveni, saying: \"Museveni will fall.\"", "authors": ["Bukola Adebayo"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191009133213-bobi-wine-house-arrest-screengrab-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
