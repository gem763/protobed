According to the campaign, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey is \u201cattempting to extort President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign by conjuring up a phony and outlandish bill for security.\u201d\n\nLet us pause here to acknowledge two facts. One: the Trump campaign reported it has raised, in the third quarter of this year alone, $125 million. And two: the Trump campaign has a left a trail of bad debts, some several years old at this point, in cities around the country.\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nAccording to a June report from the Center for Public Integrity, the campaign has stuck at least ten cities with security bills that reach almost $1 million dollars combined in the last three years. The costs range from a $16,191 invoice from the tiny 20,000-person Lebanon City, Ohio, to a whopping $570,000 owed to the city of El Paso since February. (That figure includes a 21% late fee assessed when the Trump campaign failed to settle up six months after the fact.)\n\nThe report only included cities that went through the trouble of invoicing the campaign for police costs. Many, the report notes, didn\u2019t even bother asking.\n\nThere\u2019s some disagreement over who should shoulder the additional security cost of campaign rallies. Some campaigns always cover security costs of their events, but it\u2019s not a universal practice. And, according to the Center for Public Integrity, \u201cin many of these cases, there are no signed contracts between the municipal governments and the Trump campaign. The cities dispatched police officers to secure Trump\u2019s events because they believe public safety required it \u2014 and the U.S. Secret Service asked for it.\u201d There are other isolated examples of candidates and cities disagreeing about who should foot the bill, but few campaign have left as many bad debts in their wake as the Trump campaign.\n\nWith the Trump campaign poised to descend on his city Thursday \u2014 and with Minneapolis Police Department cancelling days off and calling for back-up from around the state \u2014 Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey came up with a plan to make sure the campaign paid for any costs associated with the event in advance.\n\nThat plan, as recounted by Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale in an righteous email to supporters Monday night: \u201cFrey\u2019s city government preemptively informed the Target Center that it would be responsible for $530,000 in security and other costs related to the event. The Target Center then attempted to pass the costs on to the Trump campaign under threat of withholding use of the arena.\u201d\n\nParscale included an email from the Trump campaign\u2019s lawyers threatening to sue AEG, owner of the Target Center.\n\nParscale tweeted the email Monday night, accusing the mayor of \u201cabusing his power in an attempt to block the President\u2019s supporters from seeing him speak on Thursday.\u201d Trump himself piled on the next morning, retweeting his campaign manager and calling Frey a \u201clightweight mayor\u201d who \u201cis hurting the great police and other wonderful supporters.\u201d\n\nA representative for AEG declined to comment on the president\u2019s threat or to confirm whether the event would take place as scheduled, but preparations for the rally appear to be going ahead. On Tuesday afternoon Vice President Mike Pence announced he was planning to join Trump at the Target Center on Thursday.\n\nBest of Rolling Stone\n\nSee where your favorite artists and songs rank on the Rolling Stone Charts.\n\nSign up for Rolling Stone\u2019s Newsletter.
