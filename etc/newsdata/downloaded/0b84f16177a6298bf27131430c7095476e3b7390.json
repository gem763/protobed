She even credits being fat-shamed for helping her jumpstart her career and earning a place as co-host of \u201cThe View.\u201d So when a Twitter troll snidely body-shamed the host in the guise of providing unsolicited career advice, McCain was quick to shut the social media user down.\n\nOn Tuesday, McCain shared a photo of herself with fellow \u201cThe View\u201d co-host, Abby Huntsman, wearing pink for Breast Cancer Awareness month. For reasons unknown, a Twitter user commented on the tweet to discuss McCaine's profile picture.\n\nHow many pounds ago was that profile picture?\n\nJenny Craig, NutriSystem or Weight Watchers (WW) would endorse you without hesitation. \u2014 Jacklynn Johnson (@Jacklynnbj) October 1, 2019\n\n\"How many pounds ago was that profile picture?

It\u2019s so cruel,\u201d McCain said at the time.\n\n\u201cIf I weren\u2019t fat-shamed, I wouldn\u2019t have a career. Laura Ingraham said I was \u2018too plus-sized to be on TV,\u2019\u201d McCain shared. \"Shout out to Laura \u2014 I'm on \u2018The View\u2019 and you're not!\"\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Meghan McCain, no stranger to being body shamed, called out a Twitter user, who was putting down McCain over her weight, on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ohQqNVf.FZ10nkhXzCO3AA--~B/aD0xNTY2O3c9MzM1MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/749e8c70-d8c7-11e9-a7fe-4d054dc85628", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
