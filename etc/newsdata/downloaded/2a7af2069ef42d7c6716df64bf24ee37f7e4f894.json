Locals come in for their daily coffee and doughnut, but there\u2019s one thing that brings people from near and far to The Doughnut Man. The famous strawberry doughnuts. Aah! Yum. This is delicious. Customer: We really love it. It\u2019s really good. It\u2019s really delicious.\n\nCustomer: Gotta be the best.\n\nCustomer: I got it everywhere, but it\u2019s really good.\n\nCustomer: This is my first time having this doughnut. The fresh strawberries are really, really good. It\u2019s definitely worth getting messy for.\n\nCaroline: Jim Nakano opened The Doughnut Man in the spring of 1972, but it wasn\u2019t until two years later that one fruit changed his business.\n\nJim Nakano: Well, the reason we got into it is my wife says, \u201cLet\u2019s go for the American dream.\u201d In about 1974, a friend of ours who grew strawberries, \u2019cause this area was all strawberries, on the other side of the hill. That was all strawberries. But in \u201974, he came to me and says, \u201cJim, you gotta come up with a strawberry doughnut.\u201d He said, \u201cI got so much.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019ll supply you whatever you want.\u201d So we said OK. And I had another friend that said, \u201cI\u2019ll help you make the glaze and everything,\u201d \u2019cause he had a bakery and all that. Soon as we tried it, we realised that we had a good product. You could use it for the morning breakfast. It\u2019s a good snack. Lunch. Or dinner, dessert.\n\nCaroline: The shop makes hot doughnuts 24/7. They use potato flour and live yeast when prepping batches of dough. How long the dough proofs and fries for depends on the temperature and humidity inside the shop each day. The team mixes fresh strawberries with homemade strawberry jelly filling before stuffing a generous amount into the doughnut. The strawberry doughnuts are only served from February to September, so we had to see what all the hype was about. \u266a We\u2019re gonna get some doughnuts \u266a \u266a We\u2019re gonna get some doughnuts \u266a They have the classic chocolate swirls. They have their peach doughnuts. But I\u2019m here for this bad boy, the strawberry doughnuts. So, a lot of people drive here from all over California to try these doughnuts. There\u2019s been a line out the door since we came, so let\u2019s dig in. I\u2019m just gonna go for this one. We\u2019re all gonna make a mess, whatever. Ooh, yes, it is glazy. It\u2019s, this is gonna be a mess. Look at that. It\u2019s like a burger full of strawberries. Aw! But it is good. The doughnut\u2019s nice and crispy on the outside, which is pretty good. I love how it has kind of this, like, good texture on the bottom, if that makes sense. But it\u2019s not too sweet. It\u2019s not, like, a overwhelmingly sweet doughnut. My biggest piece of advice is use a fork. Don\u2019t do what I did. Not only is The Doughnut Man famous among locals, but we met people from all over the state who came down to try it for themselves.\n\nCustomer: Well, it was bookmarked on my Yelp for three years. So I was like, \u201cOne day I\u2019m gonna go.\u201d Came to Torrance, and then from Torrance we came to Glendora. And we\u2019re like, \u201cWe\u2019re in Glendora.\u201d Definitely gonna get the fresh peach and the fresh strawberries, and then I\u2019ll see what else is on the menu. Customer: I\u2019ve been coming here for years, yeah.\n\nCustomer: Yeah, and we\u2019re on a road trip to San Diego. Customer: Yeah, the road-trip food.\n\nCustomer: And we were like, \u201cHmm, we\u2019re craving doughnuts.\u201d Producer: When\u2019s the first time you had one?\n\nCustomer: Hmm, honest? When I moved here, probably 22 years ago. Mm. [laughs] If you eat it with a fork, you don\u2019t blend all the flavours. Customer: That\u2019s true, never thought of it. Customer: This is a true blend of all the flavour.\n\nCustomer: I remember coming here in high school. After, like, the pep rallies and stuff, people would come and hang out in that parking lot back there. And so it\u2019s definitely, like, the go-to area in Glendora, I would say.\n\nJim: We\u2019re very lucky, \u2019cause when I started this store, I told my wife we wouldn\u2019t be that big of a store because we\u2019re such a small community and all of that. I would say 60% to 70% of our customers come from more than seven miles away, and that\u2019s unusual. And then I get big-headed when you go somewhere, maybe, and then somebody says, \u201cOh, I know you. You run The Doughnut Man.\u201d Those are my favourite things. Caroline: I\u2019m not gonna count this as a doughnut. I\u2019m gonna count this as, like, a healthy breakfast with a little bit of dessert, because that\u2019s what it is. You get more strawberries than you do doughnut, which is amazing. It\u2019s like you\u2019re eating healthy.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
