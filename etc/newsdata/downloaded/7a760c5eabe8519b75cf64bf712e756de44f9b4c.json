Excerpt:\n\nA Grand Rapids federal judge has halted a new state policy that bans state contracts with foster and adoption agencies that refuse to work with gay couples. The state\u2019s settlement and comments made by Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel about the policy prior to taking office show \u201cthat the state\u2019s new position targets St. Vincent\u2019s religious beliefs,\u201d U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker wrote in his Thursday opinion.\n\nMore:\n\nIn his opinion, Jonker said Nessel \u201cis at the very heart of the case\u201d in part because of comments she made on the campaign trail in which she described supporters of the state\u2019s prior policy as \u201chate mongers\u201d and said she \u201ccould not justify using the state\u2019s money\u201d to defend \u201ca law whose only purpose is discriminatory animus.\u201d Shortly after taking office, Nessel agreed to change state policy so contracts with agencies that refused to work with gay couples would be terminated. \u201cAll of this supports a strong inference that St. Vincent was targeted based on its religious belief, and that it was defendant Nessel who targeted it,\u201d wrote Jonker, an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush.\n\nMore:\n\nThe case revolves not around whether same-sex couples can be great parents, Jonker wrote, but around \u201cwhether St. Vincent may continue to do this work and still profess and promote the traditional Catholic belief that marriage as ordained by God is for one man and one woman.\u201d Without state contacts, St. Vincent would be forced to close its doors, the agency argued. Further, other adoption agencies are available to gay couples seeking a child. As of mid-February, St. Vincent and Bethany [two Christian adoption agencies barred by the state regulations] were responsible for nearly 10% of the more than 13,000 children under state supervision.\n\nGot that? Around 90 percent of the state\u2019s adoptions are through agencies that adopt out to same-sex couples. The State of Michigan attempted to destroy the work of these two Christian agencies, out of anti-Christian animus. It wasn\u2019t about giving gay couples the right to adopt; it was about making sure that no adoption agency administered according to Christian principles could operate at all. The state\u2019s Attorney General, Dana Nessel, comes across as an anti-Christian bigot.\n\nFrom the text of the ruling:\n\nThe State Defendants seek dismissal of Defendant Nessel from the case. They contend that she is simply the State\u2019s chief legal counsel, is not responsible for Michigan\u2019s change in policy, and does not belong in the case. The record undercuts the claim. Based on the record to date, Defendant Nessel is at the very heart of the case. She referred to proponents of the 2015 law as hate-mongers\u201d and said the only purpose of the 2015 law was \u201cdiscriminatory animus.\u201d She described the 2015 law as \u201cindefensible\u201d during her campaign. These statements raise a strong inference of a hostility toward a religious viewpoint. Based on the present record, she was also a pivotal player in the State\u2019s total reversal of position in the Dumont litigation. It was her assessment of risk that led the State to move from defending St. Vincent\u2019s position to abandoning it in the first month of her term \u2013 and this despite the 2015 law, the language of the contracts, and well- established practice. All of this supports a strong inference that St. Vincent was targeted based on its religious belief, and that it was Defendant Nessel who targeted it. See Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Comm\u2019n, 138 S. Ct. 1719, 1729-31 (2018) (detailing disparaging statements of government decision-makers regarding particular religious beliefs and emphasizing the \u201cState\u2019s duty under the First Amendment not to base laws or regulations on hostility to a religion or religious viewpoint\u201d). On this record, dismissal of Defendant Nessel from the case is not warranted.\n\nAs we have now started a national battle royal over the presidency, it is good to be reminded why it really matters to vote for Republican presidential and Senate candidates. As the country grows more and more anti-Christian \u2014 see here for more \u2014 federal judges who care about First Amendment guarantees of religious liberty are going to be our last lines of defense from bigoted Democratic officeholders.\n\nUPDATE: Libertarian columnist Megan McArdle pointed out a couple of weeks ago why conservatives fear the illiberal left. Excerpt:\n\nIf you\u2019d told me 10 years ago that same-sex marriage meant evangelical Christian bakers might be legally required to cater gay weddings, I would have rolled my eyes at such hysterical conservative propaganda. Post\u2013Obergefell v. Hodges, the default left-wing position seems to be that you cannot shun gay weddings and continue to own a bakery, or work as a tech CEO. Meanwhile, the American Civil Liberties Union went after Catholic hospitals for refusing to provide abortions, and companies have threatened to boycott states that sided with conservatives in the conflict between LGBTQ rights and religious liberty. So it\u2019s not unreasonable for social conservatives to worry about a more European or Canadian future, in which nurses are told to supervise abortions or stop being nurses, doctors are forced to refer patients for abortion or euthanasia, and religious schools are told to give up either the religion or the school. You can believe that French-ism is superior to Ahmari-ism in principle and practice, while also recognizing its utter dependence on a good-faith negotiating partner. For the center-right to hammer out a peace the religious right can live with, it needs a counterpart on the left that can stand up to its illiberal flanks and deliver a deal.\n\nSocial conservatives may despise Donald Trump, but only a Republican president and a Republican Senate will deliver federal judges who will stand up the the illiberal left. That\u2019s a fact.\n\nUPDATE.2: Here\u2019s how fanatical AG Nessel is. She sees \u201ctheocracy\u201d looming in a Trump-administration regulation designed to protect Catholic hospitals from having to perform abortions, sex-change operations, or participate in assisted suicide. In a statement, the AG said:\n\n\u201cThis display of contempt for the doctrine of separation between church and state is alarming and terrifying,\u201d said Nessel. \u201cAccording to our federal government, healthcare providers, from doctors to clerical staff, can decide who deserves medical care ranging from the most routine check-ups to lifesaving medical treatment \u2013 all based upon the purported religious, moral, or ethical beliefs of the provider. Healthcare treatment should be dictated by approved medical standards and a patient\u2019s decisions about the type of care he or she wishes to receive, not the personal beliefs of those who hold themselves out as medical professionals. The imposition of this rule catapults our nation further toward America devolving into a virtual theocracy.\u201d\n\nNote that the Trump administration was not outlawing these medical practices. It was only saying that hospitals can\u2019t be forced to do them over conscience objections. That the fanatical Nurse Nessel cannot abide.\n\nDid you see the news earlier this month that an appeals court in California allowed a lawsuit against a Catholic hospital to go forward? A female-to-male transsexual demanded that the hospital give her a hysterectomy as part of her adventure in transitioning. The hospital does not sterilize people except in conditions when it\u2019s \u201cmedically necessary.\u201d Despite the fact that the Catholic hospital arranged for the surgery to take place at another hospital within 72 hours, the patient wants to sue the hospital, to rub its nose in its alleged bigotry. And the California judges allowed the suit to go forward.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rod Dreher"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-26-at-7.50.51-PM.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
