No, not in any way, not in any way whatsoever.\u201d\n\nTrump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, have repeatedly made discredited claims that Joe Biden used his position as the Obama administration\u2019s point person on Ukraine to help quash an investigation in 2016 into the owner of one of the country\u2019s largest private gas companies where Hunter sat on the board.\n\nTrump\u2019s efforts to get the newly elected government in Ukraine to investigate the Bidens are at the center of an impeachment inquiry now being conducted by the House.\n\n\u201cI joined a board, I served honorably, I focused on corporate governance,\u201d Hunter Biden told ABC. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any discussions with my father before or after I joined the board, as it relates to it, other than that brief exchange that we had.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden served a five-year term on the board of Burisma, the owner of which had been under investigation for alleged money laundering and abuse of power. The allegations predated his joining the board in April of 2014. He stepped down earlier this year.\n\n\u201cWas it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is a swamp in many ways?\u201d Hunter Biden said in the interview. \u201cYeah. And so I take, I take full responsibility for that.\u201d\n\nHe also said that while the Biden name has probably helped professionally during his life, there has been \u201ca lot of misinformation\u201d about his qualifications for his role on the board of the gas company.\n\nA graduate of Yale Law School, Biden served as vice chairman of the board of Amtrak from 2006 to 2009. He\u2019s also worked for the law firm Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP.\n\n\u201cI think I had as much knowledge as anybody else that was on the board,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a statement released through his attorney Sunday, Hunter Biden said he would resign from the board of a BHR (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Company, a Chinese-backed private equity company, and promised to forgo all foreign work if his father\u2019s elected president.\n\nHe\u2019s also disputed Trump\u2019s repeated unsubstantiated allegations that he procured $1.5 billion from BHR after he flew on Air Force Two with his father in December 2013 to Beijing.\n\nTrump, in a tweet on Tuesday, disparaged Hunter Biden\u2019s interview.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim that Hunter walked away with $1.5 billion from China appears to be based on a fund-raising target that BHR announced in 2014. But BHR never raised a discreet pool of capital, according to the statement from his attorney Sunday, and instead raised money deal by deal. BHR now says it manages about $2.1 billion in investments.\n\nBiden denied he played a role in forming the company or having any equity in it while his father was vice president. The board position was unpaid, he said. After his father\u2019s term ended in 2017, Biden bought 10% of the management company for about $420,000. He hasn\u2019t made money from the venture to date, according to the statement.\n\nHe announced he\u2019ll resign from the BHR board by Oct. 31.\n\n(Adds Trump tweet in 13th paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Kathleen Miller in Washington at kmiller01@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Kasia Klimasinska at kklimasinska@bloomberg.net, Elizabeth Wasserman, Kathleen Hunter\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Hunter Biden, the son of former vice president and Democratic 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden, said his service on a Ukraine gas company board was proper but may have been a bad idea in hindsight.\u201cIn retrospect, I think that it was poor judgment on my part,\u201d Hunter Biden said in an", "authors": ["Kathleen Miller"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vCeBRIgQ6YB1wxpN34Phvw--~B/aD0xMDcwO3c9MTQyNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/60407b1d003a8eb04b16b7a948a95b2c", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
