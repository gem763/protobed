It published a memo over the summer that reminded workers to eschew political discussions that might upset others. The company said it would monitor forums and intervene when necessary.\n\nAD\n\nBut employees have increasingly pushed back against management. The large-scale walkout last year followed reports of payouts to executives accused of sexual misconduct. Some employees alleged that the company retaliated against them for participating, which Google denied.\n\nAD\n\nGoogle is struggling to maintain its famously uninhibited culture while also responding to criticism from the White House over alleged anti-conservative bias and from employees who have openly protested against proposed defense projects and other initiatives.\n\nGoogle spokeswoman Gina Scigliano declined to comment.\n\nGoogle is not the only company grappling with employee dissent. Earlier this month, Facebook employees leaked audio of an all-hands meeting featuring chief executive Mark Zuckerberg talking candidly about the presidential election, company rival Twitter and antitrust concerns. In response, the embattled social media giant streamed its next all-hands meeting live to the public.\n\nAD\n\nWeekly all-hands meetings such as Google\u2019s TGIF are a part of Silicon Valley\u2019s culture of transparency, giving regular employees the opportunity to ask tough questions of management in an open forum, typically a holdover from their days as start-ups. But for the biggest companies, leaders may be loath to fully address sensitive matters, leaving some employees dissatisfied.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think we need to figure out how to make this work better so we can actually drive the open culture we have,\u201d Pichai said at the all-hands meeting. \u201cThat needs to come with some balance \u2014 you\u2019ve clearly seen the amount of leaks we are seeing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe care about getting it right, and we are striving to do better,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAt the meeting, Paul Wilcox, an internal communications manager, said Google removed an online question submitted ahead of the event by an employee about the hiring of Taylor, chief of staff to Kirstjen Nielsen when she was homeland security secretary. Wilcox said the question violated Google\u2019s guidelines, without providing details. Some Google employees were upset because they believed Taylor held beliefs opposing management\u2019s, including enforcing a ban on immigration from some majority-Muslim countries and family separation at the border, BuzzFeed reported earlier.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAre we supporting the border camps now?\u201d asked an employee in another online question, referring to Taylor\u2019s hiring in its public policy office.\n\nKaran Bhatia, a Google vice president for government affairs, defended Taylor\u2019s hiring, saying his expertise is in counterterrorism and national security. \u201cThat\u2019s the role they will be playing with us, not in the immigration space,\u201d he said. Bhatia said a BuzzFeed report about Taylor was inaccurate because Taylor did not formulate the travel ban, though Bhatia acknowledged he had later defended it publicly.\n\nAD\n\nHe said Google still opposes the travel ban instituted by the Trump administration in 2017. \u201cWe have consistently been engaged in litigation challenging it over time,\u201d he said.\n\nBut many of the questions related to software embedded internally in Google\u2019s Chrome browser that employees worried was designed to monitor large gatherings. The software engages when employees try to create meetings for 100 or more workers.\n\nAD\n\nPichai and others said the intent of the software is not to prevent meetings or to stifle conversation, but they acknowledged that its implementation was flawed. \u201cHow do you have a working process and how do you do it at scale with 120,000 people?\u201d Pichai said. \u201cThese are good questions. I think we need to think through and come to better answers.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think it upset a few people, probably a lot of people,\u201d he said, according to the video.\n\n\u201cCommunity moderation at scale is hard,\u201d Pichai said. \u201cIn some ways it gives us a sense of the kind of issues we deal with externally on our products when we try to moderate content.\u201d\n\nLuiz Barroso, a Google vice president of engineering, acknowledged that the software will eventually help Google monitor internal forums. He showed a version of the software that will ask users to flag inappropriate content, including answers such as \u201crude behavior,\u201d \u201cconfidential information\u201d and \u201cexplicit content.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe told the room that the content moderation team \u201cdeserves your trust.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGoogle\u2019s Pichai, Barroso and Bhatia chastised workers for leaking information to the press. \u201cThere is a degree of, perhaps, mistrust for some in our company towards our colleagues or towards the company that seems really eye-opening to me,\u201d Barroso said. \u201cEspecially when that kind of mistrust manifests itself by leaks to the press, which in turn can actually put our colleagues in harm,\u201d he added, without explaining.\n\nBhatia later said media stories \u201care sometimes misleading.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "At Google\u2019s closed-door meeting, CEO Sundar Pichai and other top executives sought to quell employee discontent and defended the hiring of a former Department of Homeland Security official, while chastising employees for airing their gripes publicly.", "authors": ["Greg Bensinger", "Reporter Covering Algorithms", "Artificial Intelligence"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0hOwnwCp0cPeCoH79_r2_9rFr4k=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IEDC5MHGBAI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
