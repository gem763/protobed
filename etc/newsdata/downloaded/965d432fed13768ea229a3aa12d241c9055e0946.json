Cohen: Trump \u2018Doesn\u2019t Give Credit\u2019 Where Due, al-Baghdadi Raid \u2018All About Him\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "On Monday\u2019s broadcast of \u201cMSNBC Live,\u201d Representative Steve Cohen (D-TN) stated that President Trump isn\u2019t giving credit where it\u2019s due on the raid that killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and that to the president, \u201cIt\u2019s all about him. This raid was him.\u201d\n\nCohen said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s just the personalization of policy that we\u2019ve seen with this president. He doesn\u2019t work with others. He doesn\u2019t try to form a team. He doesn\u2019t think ahead, and he doesn\u2019t take advice. It\u2019s all about him. This raid was him. The fact was, the raid was about our military, the outstanding Delta Force, the CIA, and the Kurds, and he doesn\u2019t give credit where credit is due. And not sharing information with the other policymakers like Adam Schiff and Speaker Pelosi just jeopardizes him. If the raid was unsuccessful, he wouldn\u2019t have an opportunity to say, but you knew about it and you didn\u2019t comment.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "description": "On Monday's broadcast of \"MSNBC Live,\" Representative Steve Cohen (D-TN) stated that President Trump isn't giving credit where it's due on the raid that | Clips", "authors": ["Ian Hanchett"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/12/Cohen-128-Thumbnail.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
