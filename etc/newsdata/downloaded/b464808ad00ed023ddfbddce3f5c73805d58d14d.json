Days prior to Margaret Atwood releasing the sequel to her best-selling Handmaid\u2019s Tale novel, The Testaments, Hulu and M&G have already swooped in and snagged the rights to adapt it. Per THR, Handmaid\u2019s Tale showrunner Bruce Miller is currently in discussions with the studio and streaming service about how the dystopian sequel can serve as an \u201cimportant extension\u201d to the show, whether it\u2019s in the form of a series, miniseries, or film. (Hulu\u2019s Handmaid\u2019s Tale series has been renewed for a fourth season, and has deviated substantially from the source material.) The Testaments, which has already been put on the 2019 Man Booker short list, is told from three different female perspectives 15 years after the events of the first novel, and also dives into Aunt Lydia\u2019s past.
