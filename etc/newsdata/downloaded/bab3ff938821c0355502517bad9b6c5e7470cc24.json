Wrapped up Michael Hooper from the kick-off to force the turnover and didn\u2019t stop after that. A bright future awaits for the youngster.\n\nLewis Ludlam (England)\n\nYes, it was the USA. Yes, England were never threatened. But that didn\u2019t stop Lewis Ludlam from delivering a deeply impressive display in Kobe. Exerted himself well at the breakdown in the first half before offering a ball-carrying threat in the second. Saw his efforts rewarded with a try. His rise and rise on the international stage continues.\n\nFinn Russell (Scotland)\n\nMuch more like it from the Scottish 10. Russell\u2019s creativity was behind both of Scotland\u2019s opening two tries, his cross field kick for Sean Maitland\u2019s score particularly impressive. Guilty of a few dropped balls \u2013 as was the rest of his team \u2013 but didn\u2019t let that faze him as he pulled the strings for much of the match.\n\nGareth Davies (Wales)\n\nMaking his second appearance in The Independent\u2019s \u2018Home Nations Power Rankings\u2019 \u2013 a true honour \u2013 Davies was simply sensational against Australia. His shrewd reading of the game saw him repeatedly intercept the exchanges between Australia\u2019s half-back pair, one of which culminated in a try. Threatening throughout, and with a strong kicking game to boot, he\u2019s established himself as the best 9 of the tournament so far.\n\nJustin Tipuric (Wales)\n\nWould feel wrong to have Wainwright and not include his partner in crime. As was the case against Georgia, Tipuric was once against a force to be reckoned with. A source of consistency at the line-out and second only to his captain\u2019s tackle count. Helped negate the threat posed by Australia\u2019s own back-row pairing.\n\nGeorge Ford (England)\n\nThe fly-half was at the heart of England\u2019s victory over the US as he put his smart kicking and safe hands to good work. Nothing mesmerising but a very composed and controlled performance, the sort England will need when they take on bigger challenges as the competition progresses. Nabbed a try early on too.\n\nBad day\n\nRob Kearney (Ireland)\n\nNot the return to action he anticipated. Having missed the opening win against Scotland due to injury, the full-back was back in the starting line-up to face Japan but didn\u2019t make it to the second half after failing an HIA. Despite scoring his team\u2019s second, it proved to be a frustrating afternoon for him.\n\nRory Best (Ireland)\n\nThe Ireland captain had been solid at the set-piece in his side\u2019s opener but seemed to fall to pieces when it mattered most against Japan. Two poor throws at the line-out proved costly. A match that will likely stay with him for a while.\n\nIain Henderson (Ireland)\n\nA quiet game from him and must share responsibility with Rory Best for Ireland\u2019s line-out failures. Ultimately failed to step up to the mark once Japan got going. Asks questions of his leadership credentials when under pressure. Also calls into light the decision not to bring Devin Toner to this World Cup.\n\nAllan Dell (Scotland)\n\nWent off with a head knock after just 13 minutes. Looked devastated from the Scotland bench as his side set about thumping the Samoans.", "description": "It was another win for England\u00a0and Wales, beating USA and Australia respectively, to keep their Rugby World Cup campaigns ticking along nicely.
