DFS boasts over $10 billion in assets -- which would put it around the top 5% of all US banks -- and in the last six months, DFS performed $3.7 billion-worth of transactions.\n\nSpeaking with ZDNet while in Australia last week, DFS president Bill Wavro said where his business fits in within an organisation's digital transformation is in situations where a customer wants to acquire technology; some of the key decisions that customers have outside the technology side of it, is how they're going to pay for it and how they're going to consume it.\n\nDFS is essentially applying the principles of the on-demand economy to technology consumption.\n\nWavro believes this type of model could be the way of the future, with customers increasingly looking to consume technology in such a way.\n\nSee also: 5 trends driving end of ownership and growth of subscription economy\n\n\"CIOs -- they're not getting a lot bigger budgets, and so they're looking for ways to try to match that expenditure with their transformation strategy,\" he said. \"All the costs can be put together into one payment plan that you can then work around your budget ... we're seeing that all up and down the stack.\n\n\"And I think it's probably now more than ever, just because of the massive need that CIOs and our customers have with this transformation pressure.\"\n\nAccording to Wavro, a consumption-type model is a way to \"democratise\" technology, with the DFS president saying small to medium-sized enterprises often have the need to match costs with technology.\n\n\"Costs are different, but needs are still the same -- how do you fund these technology purchases and do it in a way that you're paying as you receive the benefit,\" he said.\n\nWavro said DFS somewhat bridges the gap between technology people and CFOs.\n\n\"We view ourselves as kind of a combination technical advisor and finance advisor -- we're a hybrid,\" he said.\n\nMORE FROM DELL TECHNOLOGIES\n\nHow to run a company like Michael Dell: A lesson in mergers, acquisitions, and cultural alignment\n\nZDNet sits down with Dell's CEO during Dell Technologies World to discuss how the company ensures that its set of goals are culturally aligned across all of the tech behemoth's brands.\n\nDell Technologies makes VMware linchpin of hybrid cloud, data center as a service, end user strategies\n\nDell Technologies' hybrid cloud and data center as a service strategies highlight how VMware is acting as the strategic glue for the technology giant's portfolio of companies.\n\nDell Technologies using 3D printing to transform prosthetics\n\nEVP and CCO Karen Quintos described the initiative as one taking the power of technology and combining it with human spirit to scale it for the greater good.\n\nAdvocating for women entrepreneurs: Dell proposes 3 areas for change (TechRepublic)\n\nThe company believes these three key learnings, if supported by local governments, can add up to big changes for women-owned businesses globally.", "description": "The company's financial services arm is essentially applying the principles of the on-demand economy to technology consumption.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/06/03/1e4fa2e4-dc25-4e05-98a6-4868c62b8000/thumbnail/770x578/0254eb8809ef6c44d6d665610c7a8934/dell-technologies-world-real-transformation.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
