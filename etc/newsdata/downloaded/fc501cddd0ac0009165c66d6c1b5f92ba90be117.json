The first daily contract didn\u2019t even trade until 18 hours after the launch.\n\nStill, Adam White, the former Coinbase executive turned Bakkt COO, seemed optimistic.\n\nHe said in an interview with CNN\u2019s Julia Chatterly that the ICE futures contracts\u2019 launch meant \u201cfor the first time ever you have an end-to-end regulated marketplace for the price discovery of bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWhite hopes that the daily and monthly futures contracts will lead price discovery, and while most of the attention is focused on the (thus far unrealized) potential for institutional money to enter the space through Bakkt, White opened the door for retail investors to enter the market, saying:\n\n\u201cBakkt is really designed for the institutional trader. So this is a futures contract. That said, we expect this futures contract to trade through retail brokerages as well, so retail customers can trade this contract.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that ICE has been working on Bakkt and the futures contract \u201cfor over two years.\u201d (The project was first made public during summer 2018.)\n\nDemand may be slow to ramp up, however.\n\nIn comments of his own to CNBC\u2019s Closing Bell, new Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Heath Tarbert also addressed the cryptocurrency space, noting that while demand for crypto derivatives products is growing, \u201cthe demand is far below [what] we see for other commodity classes.\u201d\n\nHalvening\n\nBakkt first revealed it would offer traders a monthly contract in May, the same day it announced it had self-certified its contracts with the CFTC.\n\nWhite noted Monday that Bakkt\u2019s monthly contract extends out 12 months, meaning traders will likely be able to predict where bitcoin\u2019s price might be across a year.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s important not just for speculators but the actual businesses relying on the price of bitcoin \u2013 the miners are the companies that mine bitcoin \u2013 want to hedge their risk so we think this contract is the perfect fit for them,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe contracts might also help predict bitcoin\u2019s price movement in the months leading up to its next halvening \u2013 the quadrennial event where the number of bitcoin generated every 10 minutes is halved \u2013 he said, adding:\n\n\u201cWith that, you see a diminishing supply if the demand stays the same a lot of times you\u2019ll see the price increase. We think this is an important part of the futures contract, to help businesses discover what the fair market value of bitcoin is going to be through events like that.\u201d\n\nThe next bitcoin halving is expected around May 2020.\n\nBakkt\u2019s monthly and daily contracts each settled at a hair under $9,900, well above spot market prices, according to CoinDesk\u2019s bitcoin price index.\n\nAdam White image via CoinDesk archives", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Adam-White.jpg"}
