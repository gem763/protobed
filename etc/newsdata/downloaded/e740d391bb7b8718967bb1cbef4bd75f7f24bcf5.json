Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sanders were more frequently the target of criticism from the long-shot candidates. But in the month since the Democrats last gathered on the debate stage, Warren has overtaken not only Sanders but Biden in key national polls and in surveys out of Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nThe tenor of the critiques Warren received tonight were far milder versions of the attacks she\u2019ll have to fend off from Republicans if she\u2019s the nominee\u2014that her unabashedly progressive agenda will turn off middle-of-the-road voters, that the candidate who boasts about all her plans is being evasive about her most far-reaching proposal.\n\nHow she responds over the next few months might well determine whether she keeps her perch atop the primary race. But for Warren, being the target of everyone\u2019s rhetorical fire is undoubtedly a good problem to have.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
