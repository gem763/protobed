Boeing executives have engaged with the Trump administration for months, seeking reapproval to fly the aircraft from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\n\n\u201cI was willing to stand up for safety and quality, but was unable to actually have an effect in those areas,\u201d Ewbank's report read, according to the Times. \u201cBoeing management was more concerned with cost and schedule than safety or quality.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoeing is not in a business where safety can be treated as a secondary concern,\u201d he reportedly added. \u201cBut the current culture of expediency of design-to-market and cost cutting does not permit any other treatment by the work force tasked with making executive managements\u2019 fever dreams a reality.\u201d\n\nThe complaint was reportedly forwarded to the Justice Department as part of the agency's criminal probe into the 737 Max's certification process. A spokesperson for Boeing insisted to the Times that \"safety, quality and integrity are at the core of Boeing\u2019s values.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoeing offers its employees a number of channels for raising concerns and complaints and has rigorous processes in place, both to ensure that such complaints receive thorough consideration and to protect the confidentiality of employees who make them,\u201d Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe told the newspaper.", "description": "A senior engineer at Boeing reportedly filed an internal ethics complaint this year arguing that his superiors at the company decided against implementing a system that he felt could have prevented deadly crashes like two that involved the company", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/boeing737max_031219getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
