U.S. officials blamed Iran and President Donald Trump said Washington was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to retaliate.\n\nOil prices surged nearly 20% at one point on Monday, with Brent crude posting its biggest intraday gain since the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis, before paring gains.\n\nTrump approved the use of U.S. emergency oil reserves to ensure stable supply, helping steady prices some.\n\n\u201cThe attack on Saudi oil infrastructure came as a shock and a surprise to a market that had not been trading volatility and was more focused on the demand aspect over supply,\u201d said Tony Headrick, an energy market analyst at St. Paul, Minnesota commodity brokerage CHS Hedging LLC.\n\nBrent crude futures settled at $69.02 a barrel, up $8.80, or 14.6%, its largest on-day gain since at least 1988.
