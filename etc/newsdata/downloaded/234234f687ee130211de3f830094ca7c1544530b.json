Maxine Waters: Trump should be 'imprisoned,' 'placed in solitary confinement'", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Maxine Waters, one of the first Democrats to call for President Trump\u2019s impeachment after the 2016 election, declared Tuesday that the president\u2019s possible removal from office is \u201cnot good enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling on the GOP to stop Trump\u2019s filthy talk of whistleblowers being spies & using mob language implying they should be killed,\u201d the California Democrat tweeted to her 1.1 million followers.\n\n\u201cImpeachment is not good enough for Trump,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe needs to be imprisoned & placed in solitary confinement. But for now, impeachment is the imperative.\u201d\n\nMs. Waters was likely referring to controversial statements Mr. Trump reportedly made at a private event in New York last week, saying the whistleblower who reported his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky acted like a \u201cspy\u201d and that spies were punished differently \u201cin the old days when we were smart.\u201d\n\nMs. Waters also took issue with tweets by Mr. Trump that quoted Pastor Robert Jeffress, a Fox News contributor and host, who suggested that impeaching the president would lead to \u201ccivil war.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump is so irresponsible & so hungry for power & control, he would dare imply that a civil war will ensue if he\u2019s impeached,\u201d Ms. Waters tweeted. \u201cHe is dog whistling to his white supremacists to create fear & intimidation b/c he knows he is going to be impeached. He knows he deserves impeachment.\n\n\u201cTrump has corrupted so many members of his admin,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe lies, coverups, shaking down foreign countries & undermining our democracy will be recorded as one of the worst periods in the history of our country, all led by a dishonorable con man. Follow the facts, impeachment on the way.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.", "description": "Rep.
