Riverfront Blvd.\n\n\"The Ferrari veered left over the center median onto the southbound lanes and flipped multiple times ejecting the driver who was not wearing a seatbelt\u201d\n\n(Image: Twitter/@jdmiles11)\n\nKell Brook, who lost to Spence in 2017, was among those who wished the stricken fighter the best.\n\n\"Get well soon champ! Thought are with you and wishing you a full and speedy recovery,\" he tweeted.\n\nManny Pacquiao added: \"Praying for Errol Spence\" while Shawn Porter said: \"My dad always tells me, \u201cThis boxing thing is a part of your life but it\u2019s not going to last forever. U still have a lot of life to live after that.'\n\n\"With that, I'm praying for Errol Spence & his family because he has a lot of life to live and I pray he recovers quickly & fully.\"\n\nSpence, 29, who is expected to survive, was in action last month when he outpointed Porter to become a unified champion.\n\nA video on his Instagram account shows Spence dancing in a nightclub with a friend before the accident.\n\nWatch our new boxing show After The Bell Mirror Fighting has launched a new weekly boxing show in association with Betfair in which we analyse the latest big fights, play matchmaker, and preview forthcoming bouts.

It just seems like excuses after excuses.\n\n\u201cNow he\u2019s not worried about me. I honestly believe that deep down in his heart, he knows what he\u2019s going up against when he goes against me.\n\n\"He\u2019s thinking the big picture: \u2018If I take a chance like this, I need to be making as much money as possible just in case I lose.\u2019 He\u2019s talking about wanting to fight this guy and this guy.\n\n\u201cHe wants to be the A-side, and he doesn't want a 50-50 fight. That just tells you right now that he's not 100 per cent confident in his own abilities.\n\n\"He can say what he wants, but for me, if I\u2019m confident in my abilities, \u2018Okay, we can do it.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s 50-50 or not. I know I can win. So I don\u2019t have nothing to lose.\"", "description": "Spence is understood to have been driving a white Ferrari which was involved in a crash in Dallas", "authors": ["Martin Domin", "Image", "Twitter", "Frank Micelotta Fox Sports Pictu Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article20552230.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SpenceCar.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
