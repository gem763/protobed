Barclay admitted the complete opposite.\"\n\nThe prime minister's spokesman described the plans as a \"minimal administrative process\" when pressed by journalists on Mr Johnson's comments.\n\nHe said: \"The fact is that Northern Ireland is and will remain in the UK customs territory.\n\n\"The deal explicitly allows the UK to ensure unfettered market access to goods moving from Northern Ireland to GB. We don't intend to carry out checks on the movement of goods.\n\n\"There will be a minimal administrative process provided electronically.\"\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

You can't be serious.\"\n\nMr Smith replied: \"We have got our own commitments we are going to put into the withdrawal agreement bill to deliver unfettered access from GB to NI. We'll be looking at communication technology and we'll be making sure we support Northern Ireland businesses.\n\n\"We will be fully committed to making sure that business transaction, the movement of those goods will be as easy and straightforward as we can do. It's obviously in the government's interests that's the case.\"\n\nBut Mr Paisley hit back at the minister, saying he would feel \"pretty aggrieved\" if he had to fill in a form to move goods from his constituency in North Yorkshire to London.\n\nJim Shannon, another DUP MP, branded the Brexit deal \"absolutely despicable\" and worse than Theresa May's withdrawal agreement.", "description": "Boris Johnson has been accused of misleading parliament after he\u00a0claimed there would be \"no checks\" between Northern Ireland and Britain after Brexit.", "authors": ["Lizzy Buchan"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/23/12/boris-johnson-pmqs-4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
