It was acting in a representative capacity for the so-called Langebaan Four who allege Etzebeth had used a racial slur against them.\n\nThey are looking for compensation of more than R1m and orders directing Etzebeth to apologise, to undergo anger management and racial sensitivity training, and to do community service.\n\nEtzebeth has denied the allegations.\n\nNews24 reported that SAHRC commissioner Andr\u00e9 Gaum said in Parliament on Tuesday that it would investigate Jones' statements on the Eben Etzebeth matter, as well as his ongoing involvement in the case.\n\nNissen said the SAHRC had always maintained that Etzebeth was innocent until proven guilty before a court.", "description": "There is nothing untoward about the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) representing the so-called Langebaan Four in the Equality Court case against Eben Etzebeth, Western Cape commissioner Chris Nissen says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9433/32456838cf8f41328efa72ffb627a034.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
