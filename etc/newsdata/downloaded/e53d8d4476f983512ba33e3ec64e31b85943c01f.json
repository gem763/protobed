Stuck up, stupid, useless idiots,\u201d said Liam Peters, 37, a carpenter from Barling, in southeast England, who voted to leave in the 2016 referendum. \u201cWe voted for a very simple thing: to leave. We didn\u2019t vote for deals or endless negotiations. We just want to get out, but our politicians are useless, and they have turned one of the most important decisions in our history into a farce.\u201d\n\nAfter three years of painstaking negotiations, votes and delays to Brexit, many Leavers hoped that Boris Johnson would achieve what he said he would and wrench Britain out of the bloc, \u201cdo or die.\u201d But since Parliament returned from summer recess last week, Mr. Johnson has failed at every turn, losing four key votes and his majority in Parliament, and facing the humiliation of his own brother\u2019s stepping down from Parliament and his government. Ultimately, in less than one week, he lost control of Brexit \u2014 the one thing he vowed to deliver.\n\n\u201cBoris is just as useless as everyone else. He\u2019s a joke,\u201d said Tony Edwards, a 64-year-old retired truck driver from Essex in southeast England. \u201cAll the M.P.s are corrupt; they just care about collecting their paychecks. The best solution at this point is to shut down Parliament and elect new representatives because this Parliament does not represent the public. We voted out, and out means out.\u201d", "description": "Whether they wanted to leave or remain in the European Union, British voters agreed that politicians are a \u201cjoke,\u201d particularly, it seems, Prime Minister Boris Johnson.", "authors": ["Ceylan Yeginsu"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/06/world/06brexit-voices1/06brexit-voices1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
