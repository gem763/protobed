Watch American Horror Story: 1984\n\nThere\u2019s a killer on the loose, obviously.\n\nThe ninth (!) season of American Horror Story takes on the slasher flicks of the \u201980s as it follows a group of aerobics instructors who start working at a summer camp famous for its massacres. The Friday the 13th homage stars several Ryan Murphy Universe regulars, including Emma Roberts and Billie Lourd. \u2014Jen Chaney\n\nFX, September 18.\n\nBooks\n\n2. Read The Water Dancer\n\nConversations on race.\n\nTa-Nehisi Coates transformed how we talk about racial justice with his call for reparations. His first novel, the magic-realist slave-escape narrative The Water Dancer, is out September 24. \u2014Boris Kachka\n\nOne World, September 24.\n\nTV\n\n3. Watch The Good Place\n\nIt\u2019s the last season? Are you forkin\u2019 kidding me?\n\nThe existential comedy returns for its fourth and final season, which will involve one last attempt to prove humans are capable of changing for the better and, presumably, one more opportunity for Kristen Bell\u2019s Eleanor to say \u201cshrampy.\u201d \u2014J.C.\n\nNBC, September 26.\n\nMovies\n\n4. See Say Amen, Somebody\n\nRoger Ebert called it \u201cjoyful.\u201d\n\nMany of the pioneers of black gospel music were still holding on \u2014 and shouting \u2014 when George T. Nierenberg shot the interviews for his smashing 1982 documentary, now restored and primed for a national theatrical rerelease at a time when we need our minds and souls both soothed and buoyed. Thomas A. Dorsey (who\u2019s said to have merged the sacred and the profane \u2014 i.e., jazz \u2014 to create the gospel gene), Mother Willie Mae Ford Smith, and the Barrett Sisters (who are still two-thirds around) are natural talkers but supernatural performers. \u2014David Edelstein\n\nIn theaters; Film Society of Lincoln Center, through September 26.\n\nTV\n\n5. Watch mixed-ish\n\nThere is now, officially, an \u201c-ish\u201d universe.\n\nYoung Bow (Arica Himmel) is the central focus of this new ABC sitcom, which flashes back to follow Tracee Ellis Ross\u2019s black-ish character during her coming-of-age years in the \u201980s as the daughter of an interracial marriage who must adjust to suburbia after living on a commune. \u2014J.C.\n\nABC, September 24.\n\nPop Music\n\n6. Listen to Jaime\n\nA powerful record.\n\nAlabama Shakes\u2019 Brittany Howard prepares a first solo album named for Howard\u2019s older sister, who lost her battle with cancer when the singer was young. The new set is a deeper exploration of the gobsmacking vocals and guitar playing that are Howard\u2019s trademarks. \u2014Craig Jenkins\n\nATO, September 20.\n\nTV\n\n7. Watch Savage x Fenty Show\n\nRihanna\u2019s lingerie fashion show.\n\nRihanna is coming for Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s turf. Her second annual Savage x Fenty lingerie runway show took place during Fashion Week, but you can see it here a week later. Last season was so exciting one pregnant model went into labor. This year, it\u2019s a concert with Migos performing and artists like Normani walking the show.\n\nAmazon Prime Video, September 20.\n\nTV\n\n8. Watch Evil\n\nA crime show with a dollop of Ghost Hunters.\n\nRobert and Michelle King, creators of The Good Wife and The Good Fight, are behind this new series about an expert in criminal psychology (Katja Herbers), a priest-in-training (Mike Colter of Luke Cage), and a skeptical contractor (Aasif Mandvi) who investigate supernatural phenomena. The pilot is off-kilter, creepy, and worth watching. \u2014J.C.\n\nCBS, September 26.\n\nPop Music\n\n9. Listen to Jesus Is King\n\nYeezy season approaching.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been tracking Kanye West\u2019s recent Sunday Service performances, at which the rapper and producer corrals a chorus of singers for a lively mix of gospel songs, hip-hop and R&B covers, and new renditions of his own hits, you should keep an eye out for his forthcoming solo album, Jesus Is King, a purer synthesis of the blend of rap and liturgical music West has been onto since \u201cJesus Walks.\u201d \u2014C.J.\n\nG.O.O.D. Music, September 27.\n\nTV\n\n10. Watch Transparent Musicale Finale\n\nFarewell, Pfeffermans.\n\nAfter allegations of inappropriate behavior by Transparent star Jeffrey Tambor, the Amazon series about the Pfefferman family is going out in song with a two-hour movie musical that centers on the funeral for Maura, the character Tambor played. \u2014J.C.\n\nAmazon, September 27.\n\nTV\n\n11. Watch Saturday Night Live\n\nWe\u2019ll miss you, Leslie.\n\nWhen we all fall asleep, where do we go?
