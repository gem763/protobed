(Getty Images)\n\nThe 26-year-old Barrett was undrafted out of Colorado State in 2014 and signed with the Denver Broncos.\n\nBarrett spent five years with Denver, but never became a full-time starter; once the Broncos drafted linebacker Bradley Chubb last year, it seemed clear Barrett\u2019s days might be numbered.\n\nAnd they were \u2014 he played in just 25 percent of the team\u2019s defensive snaps last year, though he still managed to record three sacks and seven quarterback hits.\n\nSo Barrett was allowed to walk in 2019.\n\nOn Sunday, he had a four-sack game against the Giants, tying Tampa Bay\u2019s single-game franchise record; Marcus Jones in 1990 and Simeon Rice in 2003 also registered four-sack games.\n\nNFL Research tweeted that Barrett had 14 pressures in 36 pass-rushes against New York, the second-most in a game for a defensive player since 2016; the Buffalo Bills\u2019 Jerry Hughes had 15 pressures on 38 pass rushes in Week 3 last year.\n\nRecord-tying eight sacks\n\nMore impressively, Barrett now has 8.0 sacks in just three games, tying Mark Gastineau (1984) for the most sacks in the first three games of a season. He\u2019s on pace for a 42-sack season, which of course would be a record.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Sunday Barrett expressed disappointment that his career day came in a loss, but he has to be taking a bit of happiness in the fact that while he has 8 sacks, the Broncos as a team have zero.\n\n\"He's just wearing out left tackles,\" Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians said on Sunday.\n\nHis big day against New York also netted Barrett a $250,000 bonus, which he was set to earn for getting 8 sacks this season; he can earn another $250,000 if he totals 10 sacks, which seems like a given at this juncture.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Barrett has posted a career year just three games into the season.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/umreKCq1mHXPFXyMaYJTmQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QrMnIDYkz4kCubwLJkrhKg--~B/aD0zMjAwO3c9NDgwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/5f543c30-de1b-11e9-be53-55ab13b14c35", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
