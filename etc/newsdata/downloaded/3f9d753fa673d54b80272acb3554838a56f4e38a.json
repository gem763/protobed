REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo\n\nBut despite ongoing headwinds, including weaker global growth, ongoing trade tensions and geopolitical risks like a possibly messy British exit from the European Union, only one policymaker - St. Louis Fed President James Bullard - suggested that further policy easing is in the cards.\n\nBullard, who has focused on the fact that some short-term Treasury debt yields have risen above long-term bond yields in what is sometimes seen as a sign of coming recession, noted that for now the bond \u201cyield curve\u201d looks more normal.\n\nBut that is \u201clikely because markets are anticipating future policy moves\u201d by the Fed, Bullard told the Effingham County Chamber of Commerce.\n\nSan Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, who spoke at a separate event a few hours later in Salem, Oregon, acknowledged that the Fed\u2019s policy easing has only \u201cpartially\u201d offset the various drags on the economy. But she gave no hint about whether she will support more rate cuts to deliver a fuller offset.\n\n\u201cWhen the headwinds blow, they have real effects \u2013 that\u2019s an aggregate demand suppression,\u201d she said, explaining that she supported the Fed\u2019s cuts so far this year. \u201cWe have lower aggregate demand momentum than we would have in the absence of these headwinds, and monetary policy can and should offset that.\u201d\n\nWhen interest rates fall, households can refinance their mortgages, she said, and use the savings to buy things they otherwise might not purchase.\n\nSuch consumer spending can \u201cpartially offset\u201d slowdowns in other parts of the economy where businesses \u201chunker down\u201d trade and other uncertainty, she said.\n\nThe Fed lowered its target rate to a range of between 1.75% and 2.00% at its last meeting, its second quarter-point rate cut this year. Top officials say they will now make decisions on a \u201cmeeting by meeting\u201d basis, with no clear commitment to further reductions.\n\nDaly does not have a vote on policy this year. Bullard does, and last week used it to dissent because he felt a bigger, half-point rate cut was warranted.\n\nInvestments in contracts tied to the Fed\u2019s target policy rate show investors expect one more quarter-point reduction by the end of the year.\n\nWhile the Fed has cut short-term interest rates a half a percentage point since July, its overall shift in tone and the removal of previously expected rate hikes is one reason the economy has not slowed more than it has already, Daly said.\n\nIn fact, Bullard said, they have caused longer-term bond rates to fall by more than twice that amount.\n\nStill, he added, the Fed \u201cmay choose to provide additional accommodation going forward\u201d as global trade and other risks threaten to cause the United States to slow more than expected this year, and undercut the Fed\u2019s ability to achieve its 2% inflation target.\n\n\u201cRecent developments in global trade negotiations suggest that it will be difficult to reach a stable global trade regime\u201d anytime soon, Bullard said. \u201cThis is likely chilling global investment and feeding into slower global growth.\u201d", "description": "The Federal Reserve has delivered a boost to the economy this year not only with interest-rate cuts but also because it shifted away from its earlier view that it would need to raise rates in 2019, two Fed policymakers said on Monday.", "authors": ["Howard Schneider", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433106724&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M25U", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
