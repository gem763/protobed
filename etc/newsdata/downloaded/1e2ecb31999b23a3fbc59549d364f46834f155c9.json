And then I read the last paragraph, and my world fell apart.\u201d\n\nThe last paragraph said there was actually no green card yet available for him, and it provided no timetable for getting him one. Eight years later, the 41-year-old product-development engineer is still waiting\u2014one of roughly 1 million people stuck in a growing backlog for one of the 140,000 employment-based green cards distributed each year by the U.S. State Department. The logjam stems from U.S. rules that limit any one country to 7% of all employment-based green cards. More than 660,000 of those approved but waiting are from India.\n\nMuch of the focus on the nation\u2019s stressed immigration system has been on migrants at the southern border and Washington\u2019s inability to craft a fix. But the backlog among those awaiting permanent residency based on employer-sponsored visas presents its own political morass.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats agree it is a problem. A bipartisan bill that seeks to address the backlog\u2014the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act\u2014passed the House of Representatives in July, 365 to 65.\n\nA similar piece of legislation has been introduced in the Senate by Sen. Mike Lee, (R., Utah), who says his version is designed to provide a narrow fix, separate from any comprehensive immigration overhaul. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to eat the whole elephant in one bite,\u201d he said. But Mr. Lee faces opposition within his own party, especially from Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has introduced competing legislation.\n\nThe two men are negotiating. But other senators have raised their own concerns, and even a patchwork solution appears unlikely anytime soon.\n\nRepublican Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky have proposed different solutions to the green-card backlog.

Also pushing for the bill is Immigration Voice, a nonprofit social-welfare group founded by Indian immigrant workers.\n\nBut the American Hospital Association and AMN Healthcare , a health care staffing agency, oppose the bill because they believe one result would be to dramatically increase the wait time for green cards for other workers from overseas, particularly nurses from the Philippines.\n\nThe U.S. gives out a limited number of greencards\u2014about 1.1 million annually. About 14% go to employment-based applicants such as Mr. Indurkar. The rest go to family members looking to join relatives in the U.S., or winners of the diversity lottery, which allows people from countries with historically low rates of immigration to the U.S. a chance to obtain visas.\n\nMany of those awaiting green cards such as Mr. Indurkar have stayed in the U.S. on temporary H-1B visas for high-skilled technical workers. The number of those visas is capped annually at 85,000 but the U.S. government has approved more than 200,000 additional visas in each of the last five years, many of them for workers in the green-card backlog, according to the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, a think tank.\n\nRepublicans have resisted efforts in recent years to boost the overall number of green cards. Some are willing to increase employment-based green cards, but only if the U.S. cuts family and diversity green cards\u2014a no-go for Democrats.\n\nBoth the Senate and House bills would eliminate the current rule that no one country receive more than 7% of all employment-based green cards. That would create a single line for all green-card petitioners, allowing people who have waited the longest to go to the front of the line, instead of waiting in lines based on their countries of origin.\n\nOpponents complain this will allow Indians and Chinese\u2014who now face the longest waits\u2014to get higher priority, forcing those from other countries further back.\n\n\u201cThis is lifeboats on the Titanic. You can fight over who gets which seats, or you can get enough lifeboats, and what we\u2019ve got here is fighting over the number of seats rather than increasing the number of lifeboats,\u201d said Bruce Morrison, a former Democratic congressman from Connecticut who now lobbies for the AMA and AMN Healthcare.\n\nNadia Morozova, a traffic engineer in Columbia, S.C., worries that she will be one of the bill\u2019s casualties. A native of Russia, Ms. Morozova is in the U.S. legally on a temporary work visa. She would like to stay and become a citizen if her employer will sponsor her for a green card in the next few years. Most Russians now wait 18 months to two years to receive employment-based green cards. If Congress passes legislation to clear the backlog by lifting the country caps, however, Ms. Morozova fears she would have to wait more than a decade.\n\n\u201cI wish it would just be solved without making it worse for us,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Migration Policy Institute estimates that under the House bill, new applicants would have significant waits to receive certain types of employment-based green cards as the backlog is cleared. Depending on the type of green card, the delay could be between 2.9 and 13.5 years, according to the institute\u2019s forthcoming analysis of data from the State Department and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nThe institute didn\u2019t analyze Mr. Lee\u2019s Senate bill, which would establish a two-year transition period for employment-based green cards by setting aside a certain number for immigrants not from India or China.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How do you think the U.S. should decide which immigrants receive green cards? Join the conversation below.\n\nHe tried to pass the bill by unanimous consent in July, bypassing the hearing and committee process. Mr. Paul blocked it. Mr. Paul\u2019s bill, among other measures, would expand the number of green cards for employment-based immigrants to 270,000 from the current 140,000. Mr. Paul also has offered an amendment to ensure nurses aren\u2019t adversely affected.\n\nDemocrats in the Senate have qualms, too. \"They are increasing the immigration from countries like India a marginal small amount at the expense of cutting back on immigration from other countries in a much more dramatic fashion\u2014I don\u2019t think there\u2019s equity in that,\u201d said Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.). If a way forward is found, it is also unclear whether President Trump would sign a bill.\n\nThe White House, which is working on its own legal immigration overhaul, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nAll that leaves the likes of Mr. Indurkar in limbo. His H-1B via is only temporary, and it means he is dependent on his employer to act as his sponsor. He remains in Overland Park, Kan., in part because his young American-born son needs special education. He says the wait \u201cgets more painful with every passing year.\u201d\n\nWrite to Lindsay Wise at lindsay.wise@wsj.com", "description": "Washington\u2019s inability to craft a fix for Southern-border issues has dominated the immigration conversation.
