He's fast. He's also unselfish on his end.\"\n\nRead more: 2 teenage soccer stars who once played together as children could soon become the sport's biggest rivals since Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo\n\nNicolas Lodeiro, Rossi's countryman who currently plays for the Seattle Sounders, has played against him, and reciprocates Bradley's praise.\n\n\"Diego is a great soccer player, with a lot of talent and a bright future,\" Lodeiro told MLS Soccer. \"He's a young striker with a lot of speed and good technique.\n\n\"[Diego is] a nightmare for the defense because he can play as a forward or as winger. His versatility to hit the ball and to assist his teammates, makes him a very dangerous weapon.\"\n\nIt was love at first sight for LAFC and Rossi\n\nLAFC was mostly playerless in June 2017, less than a year before its inaugural MLS match was scheduled to take place.\n\nIt was Bob Bradley, and John Thorrington \u2014 a former Manchester United youth player and now the club's general director \u2014 who were tasked with assembling a squad that could compete for the MLS Cup.\n\nFortunately, the pair had Victor De Los Santosa, their \"scout on the ground\" in Montevideo, that tipped them off about the Uruguayan's talents, according to Medium.\n\n\"It was as simple as Victor saying 'I have the guy,'\" Thorrington told MLS Soccer.\n\nA trip to watch Rossi in action first hand shortly followed for Bradley and Thorrington, and it didn't take long for them to know he was someone they must have on their roster.\n\nRossi in action for Penarol in 2017. Reuters/Adres Stapff\n\nIn December 2017, Rossi was officially announced an LAFC player for the 2018 season, with the newly formed MLS side having paid Penarol $4 million for his signature.\n\nWhile Rossi had to wait until March 2018 to make his first appearance he went on to score LAFC's first ever goal at the Banc of California Stadium just 11 minutes into his debut.\n\nSince, the Uruguayan has gone from strength to strength, benefiting from the experienced players around him such as Vela and Walker Zimmerman, as well as the freedom bestowed upon him by Bradley.\n\nNow he's attracting attention from Europe's elite\n\nA number of MLS youngsters have fled the division for Europe over the past few seasons. Alphonso Davies joined FC Bayern Munich from the Vancouver Whitecaps in 2018. And, more recently, Miguel Almiron left Atlanta United for Newcastle United in January.\n\nRossi is now next in line to make the switch across the pond according to reports.\n\nFootball Italia reports that Fiorentina made a bid of $8.8 million for Rossi earlier in the summer, falling just short of LAFC's reported $13.2 million asking price.\n\nRussian club FC Krasnodar is also reportedly admiring the Uruguayan, says Championat.\n\nRead more: Jadon Sancho, a 19-year-old who has been compared to Neymar, is now worth far more than the declining Paris Saint-Germain super forward\n\nNo move is yet to materialise, however it seems only a matter of time as Rossi has already admitted his desire to play for the Uruguay national team and to compete club-level soccer in Europe.\n\n\"For all Uruguayan guys, it's a dream to be there with the national team,\" Rossi told The Athletic when questioned about his future ambitions. \"I'm working hard to be there. When the opportunity comes, I have to be ready. I'm working hard for that, and also to be in Europe.\"\n\nThorringdon also concedes Rossi's talents could see him leave LAFC and the MLS sooner rather than later.\n\n\"Not surprisingly, yes, there is interest,\" he said, speaking with MLS Soccer. \"I'm sure there will continue to be interest. It's flattering but not altogether surprising given his and the team's success.\"\n\nHe added: \"He's worth as much as someone is willing to pay for him.\"", "description": "Diego Rossi signed for Los Angeles FC in 2017 and has since been a key component in its success, scoring 28 goals and 18 assists.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9c9dec72fd824ac8461edd?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
