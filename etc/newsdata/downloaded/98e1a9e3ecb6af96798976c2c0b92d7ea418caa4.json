Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government ... But look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg later shared the report on social media, saying it provided \"an unfiltered version of what I'm thinking and telling employees on a bunch of topics\" including \"breaking up tech companies.\"\n\nThe remarks quickly drew a rebuke from the progressive firebrand, who fired back on Twitter: \u201cWhat would really \u2018suck\u2019 is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d\n\nThe dust-up comes as the 2020 election season heats up and questions linger over whether Facebook is up to the task of combating political misinformation after failing to curb a Russian campaign to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Perceived hostility to a major Democratic candidate could exacerbate tensions between Facebook and a party that once viewed the company and its Silicon Valley peers as bastions of American innovation.\n\nAnd it marks the most direct public skirmish between Warren and Zuckerberg since the Massachusetts lawmaker unveiled her campaign plan to split up the company. Warren ignited fresh debate over whether Facebook and other tech giants have grown too big and powerful with that March proposal, which would force Zuckerberg's company to spin off its two biggest acquisitions: Instagram and WhatsApp. Since then, other 2020 Democratic hopefuls have piled on with calls for federal regulators to either investigate tech giants for anti-competitive conduct or to outright dismantle them.\n\nThe calls reflect Silicon Valley's shifting headwinds in Washington, which increasingly views the industry as under-regulated and over-concentrated. Democrats and Republicans alike are increasingly calling for lawmakers in Congress and regulators at the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission to rein in tech titans like Facebook, Google and Amazon.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, both agencies have in fact launched antitrust probes of major tech companies, though it's not yet clear if those will lead to firm action. Democrats scoffed at recent FTC fines that resolved privacy investigations into Facebook and Google's YouTube, contending Trump's chosen regulators are failing to hold tech accountable for misdeeds despite the sharp rhetoric aimed at the industry.\n\nWarren was one of those voices, tying her critiques to her central argument that tech's power and size pose myriad consumer harms. Allies in Warren's crusade on tech say Zuckerberg's candid remarks to staffers validate her approach.\n\n\u201cA hallmark of Warren\u2019s career has been challenging corporate power on behalf of regular people, and this just serves as a real validator that she\u2019s a real threat to both Wall Street executives and tech moguls,\" said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.\n\nStacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance and a proponent of Warren's plan to break up Facebook, said the audio also served to thrust the debate over tech and antitrust back into the campaign limelight.\n\n\"Zuckerberg\u2019s leaked comments remind people that the federal government has potent legal tools to rein these giants in, if enforcement officials opted to use them,\" Mitchell told POLITICO. \"He\u2019s helping to ensure that monopoly policy continues to be a standout issue in this election.\"", "description": "Mark Zuckerberg pledged to \u201cgo to the mat\u201d to fend off Elizabeth Warren\u2019s plan to break up Facebook in an audio recording leaked Tuesday, foreshadowing a major fight between her would-be administration and the Silicon Valley giant.
