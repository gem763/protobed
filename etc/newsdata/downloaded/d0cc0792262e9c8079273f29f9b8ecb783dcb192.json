Sales there had been hurt by tariffs triggered by the US-China trade war.\n\nTesla said trial production had already started at its factory in Shanghai, the first wholly foreign-owned plant in the country. However, it still needs additional government sign-off before full production gets underway, it said.\n\n\"We have cleared initial milestones toward our manufacturing license and are working towards finalising the license and meeting other governmental requirements,\" it said.", "description": "The electric carmaker says its plans in China and for its next model are ahead of schedule.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1240E/production/_109266747_gettyimages-1078753032.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
