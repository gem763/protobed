Big parties? Check! Expensive costumes you\u2019ll only wear once and create a shit ton of plastic waste? Double check! A whole load of tat produced by the infernal machine of capitalism? TRIPLE CHECK!\n\nSo, in this Halloween gift guide, we\u2019re going to give you a selection of SPOOKY things you can buy to make your holiday that bit more terrifying(-ly consumerist).\n\nDon\u2019t think Hocus Pocus is scary? Think it\u2019s actually a light comedy perfect for the whole family? Well, how about you tell that to eight year old me?\n\nBecause he was fucking terrified.\n\nPrice: ~$3.99 to rent, $9.99 to buy\n\nLet\u2019s say you want to make your bathtub look like a portal to another dimension. How would you go about doing that? Easy: drop this bath bomb in and watch a colorful explosion engulf the water.\n\nAlso, it has CBD in it, which might help relax you with all these TERRIFYING CONSUMERIST SCARES going around.\n\nDon\u2019t get the connection between a bath bomb and Halloween (IT LOOKS LIKE A VORTEX, COME ON)? And would you rather ingest your CBD? Well, you can get some Halloween CBD gummies here too.\n\nBut the bath bomb\u2019s legit.\n\nPrice: ~$21.99\n\nYeah, AR is cool and everything, but we\u2019re a few years away from being able to transmit the illusion of you being a skeleton to everyone wearing smart glasses. This is why we need to do it the old fashioned way: with socks.\n\nSlap a pair of these on at whatever party you\u2019re at, do a jangly calcium boy dance, then run off into the distance (because these are also cushioned). Spectacularly spooky.\n\nPrice: ~$12.99\n\nYou\u2019ve got a Halloween planned? Want it to pop? Easy \u2014 project some terrifying horror movies (like\u2026 Hocus Pocus) onto the walls of your house. And the easiest way to do that is with the Vankyo Leisure 420 (lol).\n\nWe\u2019ve been a fan of Vankyo projectors here at TNW for a while, and when this is so cheap, you have no excuse not to get sp0oOoky.\n\nPrice: ~$84.99\n\nPicture the scene. You hide one walkie talkie. Someone about to be scared enters the room. You, from another room, say something scary into the other walkie talkie. That person that was about to be scared, is now, officially, scared.\n\nTruly, spooky genius. Thanks to these walkie talkies.\n\nPrice: ~$25.99\n\nMaybe, just maybe, you think the walkie talkie trick is too old school. Don\u2019t concern yourself, we have something more futuristic: a security camera with night vision and a two-way communication ability.\n\nBasically, if you wanna be really creepy, install this at your house, wait \u2019til someone comes, then SCAAAAAAAARE the SOOOOOOOOOOUL out of that sucker.\n\nPrice: ~$89.99\n\nCandles are the spookiest light source. So here\u2019s a big fucking box of them.\n\nPrice: ~$21.99\n\nLook, Halloween isn\u2019t all about being physically spooked \u2014 it can be about getting scared mentally too.\n\nSo here\u2019s the OG monster story, a Halloween classic, and a banging book: Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein. Screw everyone else, spend some time alone. Spookily.\n\nPrice: ~$7.99\n\nWho knows, maybe 19th century gothic literature isn\u2019t your idea of a good scare. Well, Stephen King\u2019s \u2018Salem\u2019s Lot might work for you instead. It\u2019s about vampires in \u2014 yes, you guessed it \u2014 Maine.\n\nPrice: ~$7.55\n\nWell, hopefully a few of those ideas have stoked your need for a spooky, consumerist Halloween.
