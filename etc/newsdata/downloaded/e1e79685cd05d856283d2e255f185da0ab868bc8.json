Recognition and adoption is not a straight line to follow either, but rather a compilation of milestones that are achieved over time. The latest to occur was the addition of the word \u201cSatoshi\u201d to the Oxford English Dictionary.\n\nAfter being used for over seven years to describe the smallest monetary unit in the Bitcoin (BTC) digital payment system, it equals to one hundred millionth of a Bitcoin (BTC) or 0.00000001 BTC. The Oxford English Dictionary is continuously looking into new words and how they adapt to society to describe certain things, taking into account how the words emerge, grow or diminish in popularity over time and if the definition changes.\n\nAs described by Oxford\u2019s English Dictionary policy:\n\nOur role is to monitor and record emerging vocabulary so that we can make new terms available to our dictionary users as soon as they start to gain traction.\n\nFurthermore, the Oxford English Dictionary also describes how the pronunciation of the word may differ from American vocabulary to British vocabulary, stating that the \u201co\u201d in Satoshi is pronounced like the \u201c\u028a\u201d sound in foot in America, whereas in the UK the \u201co\u201d sounds like the \u201c\u0252\u201d in \u201clot.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the dictionary determines that the word satoshi is derived from the proper noun, Satoshi Nakamoto, the \u201cprobably pseudonymous\u201d creator of Bitcoin (BTC).", "description": "", "authors": ["Cryptocoin.News Is The Central News Source For Information On Cryptocurrencies.
