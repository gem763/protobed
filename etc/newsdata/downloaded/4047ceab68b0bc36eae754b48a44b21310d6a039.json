But, while Cain admitted to knowing Cara and having a relationship with her after meeting in the pub, he assured Nate that this was the first he ever knew that she was pregnant.\n\nNate branded him a liar, telling him that Cara had sent letters and made several attempts to contact him but it became clear that Cain had no idea what Nate was talking about. Faith, however, did \u2013 and turned up at the hospital to tell the full truth at last.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCain was flabbergasted as she explained that she knew that Cara had had his son \u2013 but because of Shadrach\u2019s violence and bigotry, she tried to protect Cain by keeping it a secret from him as she feared that Shadrach would hurt him, Nate and Cara.\n\nCain was disgusted with Faith for keeping this secret from him for so long and it seems inevitable that this is what will trigger her exit from the show as Cain turns his back on her for this deception.\n\nBut while biologically, Cain now knows that Nate is his offspring, he is no closer to welcoming him as his son given that Nate has come with the specific intention of destroying Cain\u2019s life by splitting him from Moira and even trying to get Kyle taken from him.\n\nWith Cain now seething and hurt by both Moira and Faith \u2013 the two women he should have trusted most \u2013 what will he do now?\n\nAnd where does this leave Nate as he has sought revenge on the wrong person?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Cain is left shocked.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Cain-Dingle-in-Emmerdale-2-efb6_1571926082.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
