Photo: Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump is a man of the people, so he knows Americans like their news delivered the same way he does: with lots of pictures and graphs. Yet, while we all know our president has the best words, somehow his commitment to excellence in props (both real and fake) has been overlooked. That ends today. In honor of Trump taking a Sharpie to a Hurricane Dorian forecast map, we\u2019re showing off the best objects shown off by the president.\n\nA Big Pile of Papers\n\n\u2018\u2018These papers are just some of the many documents that I\u2019ve signed turning over complete and total control to my sons,\u2019\u2019 President-elect Trump explained during a January 2017 press conference in Trump Tower.\n\nTrump never opened the folders, referenced specific documents, or let journalists review them, and some of the pages and folder labels appeared to be blank. But just look at all those pieces of paper! One of them had to say \u201cno conflict of interest.\u201d\n\nPhoto: DON EMMERT/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA Handwritten Letter From Obama\n\nYes, presidents usually get a letter from their predecessor, but how many of them received a long, thoughtful letter from the founder of ISIS?\n\nA Huge Chart of Regulations\n\nTrump broke out this massive chart, which shows the permitting process to build a theoretical federally funded highway, several times in April 2017. Trump promised to get rid of many of these regulations, presumably stupid considerations like \u201cProject in floodplain?\u201d and \u201cProject involve hazardous waste?\u201d\n\nPhoto: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA Big Pile of Papers Wrapped in a Ribbon\n\nWho could forget that time Trump used a scissor to SET FREE OUR DREAMS, and this inaccurately sized stack of paper?\n\nIn 1960, there were approximately 20,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations. Today there are over 185,000 pages, as seen in the Roosevelt Room.\n\n\n\nToday, we CUT THE RED TAPE! It is time to SET FREE OUR DREAMS and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! pic.twitter.com/teAVNzjvcx \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 14, 2017\n\nA Blank Piece of Paper\n\nThe president is a busy man. It\u2019s just more efficient if he signs first, fills in the bill part later.\n\nSome of the many Bills that I am signing in the Oval Office right now. Cancelled my trip on Air Force One to Florida while we wait to see if the Democrats will help us to protect America\u2019s Southern Border! pic.twitter.com/ws6LYhKcKl \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 21, 2018\n\nA Map of ISIS Territory in Syria\n\nWhen Trump declared on March 20, 2019, that the remnants of ISIS\u2019s self-declared caliphate would be \u201cgone by tonight,\u201d the New York Times countered that there were still \u201creports of continuing fighting between the extremist group and American-backed local forces in Syria.\u201d The Times supplied zero graphics to back up that claim, so it seems Trump was right.\n\nA Deal With Mexico\n\nThink President Trump doesn\u2019t have a secret agreement with Mexico? Read this folded up piece of paper (through careful photo analysis) and weep.\n\nPresident Trump waves piece of paper: \"That's the agreement that everybody says I don't have.\" pic.twitter.com/8ownEaklrP \u2014 The Hill (@thehill) June 11, 2019\n\nPlans for the Air Force One Redesign\n\nSure, Air Force One\u2019s new paint job makes it look a lot like Trump\u2019s private jet. But why didn\u2019t anyone giving Trump credit for not demanding that George Stephanopoulos \u201chop in\u201c?\n\nA Model of the Redesigned Air Force One\n\nThen-press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders suggested the president should give Justin a turn playing with it, but he said no.\n\nPhoto: Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nA Hurricane Forecast Map He Altered With a Sharpie\n\nWhile his predecessors were content to let underlings at the National Hurricane Center produce forecast maps, it appears President Trump personally doctored this map, extending the storm\u2019s path with a black marker. The haters claim Trump was trying to cover for a mistake he made days earlier, but maybe he just didn\u2019t want Alabamians to feel left out of Dorian coverage. Thoughtful!\n\nPhoto: Tom Brenner/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nHonorable Mention\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get any clearer!\u201d\n\nI just can't get over this argument.\n\n\n\n\"Look at the size. This is the Democrats. This is us.\" pic.twitter.com/0lPfRxFvMf \u2014 Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) March 7, 2017\n\nThis piece was updated after Trump unveiled his altered Dorian map.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
