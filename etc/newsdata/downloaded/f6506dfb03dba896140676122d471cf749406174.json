The very idea that one should somehow feel shame for deriving enjoyment from a product or a piece of art just because it contradicts the consensus - or, indeed, anyone else\u2019s opinion - is fundamentally hateful.\n\nIf one believes something to be good then it\u2019s good, no matter how hard the prevailing tastemakers of the age argue against it. Conventional wisdom? As no lesser wit than Sid Vicious once put it when asked how the man in the street would react to his latest outrage, \u2018I\u2019ve met the man in the street - and he\u2019s a ****\u2019.\n\nAnd yet\u2026 What if that product or piece of art contravenes one\u2019s own thresholds?\n\nGearbox\u2019s sci-fi loot shooter series Borderlands 3 is puerile in tone, repetitive to play and utter reductive. This third instalment proper particularly so; a few minor tweaks and improvements aside, it essentially offers the exact same experience its predecessor did seven years and one entire gaming generation ago. It\u2019s a one note take on a one-dimensional idea and\u2026 I absolutely love it.", "description": "Is there anything more pernicious in modern cultural criticism than the concept of a guilty pleasure?", "authors": ["Dan Silver", "Tom Hoggins"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gaming/2019/10/11/borderlands-3-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq20L1JEh39lVJdfInVOB7YYHDu8o-EVxFrO7XkJBqoAg.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
