(Paul Benoit/AP)\n\nThe Redskins are 10-point underdogs at many sportsbooks for Sunday\u2019s regular season opener in Philadelphia, which might be the largest Week 1 spread in franchise history. This marks the third time that Washington has been at least a nine-point underdog in Week 1 since 1978, which is as far back as Pro Football Reference\u2019s regular season point spread data goes. Both times, the Redskins were the visiting team. Both times, they won outright.\n\nThe most recent instance was in 2012, when rookie quarterback Robert Griffin III went into the Superdome and led the Redskins, who were nine-point dogs, to a 40-32 win over the Saints in his first career start. The time before that, against New England in 1978, involved an improbable fumble return for a touchdown, the pope and a misplaced Patriots play sheet.\n\n\n\nRobert Griffin III celebrates his first NFL touchdown pass in the Redskins' surprising win over the Saints in Week 1. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Patriots, led by Coach Chuck Fairbanks and quarterback Steve Grogan, went 9-5 in 1977 and were being talked about as Super Bowl contenders when they arrived at training camp the following year. The hype only grew during New England\u2019s dominant preseason, and the Patriots were installed as 9.5-point favorites for their Week 1 game in Foxborough, Mass. Jimmy the Greek picked the Patriots to cover the spread. SCORE, a tipsheet cited in The Post, predicted a 31-10 New England win.\n\nRedskins players were unfazed ahead of their trip to Schaefer Stadium.\n\n\u201cSure, we\u2019re playing a good football team, but I do believe we have the capability to do it,\u201d quarterback Joe Theismann told reporters a few days before the game. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly not going up there to get embarrassed. I can tell you that.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe we can shock the nation, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to shock ourselves,\u201d Redskins running back Mike Thomas said. \u201cMaybe we can get a little respect up here.\u201d\n\n[Mike Thomas, former Redskins running back and 1975 NFL rookie of the year, dies at 66]\n\n\u201cIf we play the kind of football we\u2019re capable of playing, we\u2019ll be representative,\u201d fullback John Riggins said. \u201cIf we play like an expansion team, which we certainly have the capability of doing, it will be humiliating. We\u2019ve put in a new offense. We\u2019ve had new people in there, and it\u2019s been a little unsettling. It won\u2019t be a total shock if we don\u2019t play spectacular football.\"\n\nThe Redskins also went 9-5 in 1977, but they replaced Coach George Allen with former Redskins linebacker Jack Pardee after the season. Pardee made it clear that his new players hadn\u2019t forgotten the humiliating 45-7 defeat the Patriots handed them during the preseason the year before.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest things that has held up over the years is that when a team is routed by another team, the next time they play there\u2019s an upset,\u201d Pardee said. \u201cI hope that will be the case this time. I\u2019m excited about it. I\u2019m ready to get started. We\u2019ve had preparation, work, a lot of ifs and wherefores. You\u2019re nearly as set as you\u2019d like to be, but I\u2019m ready to have something meaningful happen.\u201d\n\nSafety Ken Houston didn\u2019t just hope for a Redskins upset. He predicted one.\n\n\u201cAll you hear about New England is massive, or awesome or unbeatable,\u201d Houston said. \u201cBut they\u2019re football players, just like us. I think they\u2019re good, but I think we are, too. I believe we\u2019re going to win this football game, and I\u2019m not afraid to go on record and say it. We\u2019re sure not up there to go through the motions. We just might surprise some people, but it won\u2019t surprise us.\u201d\n\nFans hoping to watch the game on Channel 9 in D.C. may have been surprised to find coverage not from Foxboro, but from Rome, where ceremonies to mark the installation of Pope John Paul I were being held. CBS joined the Redskins-Patriots game in progress with about 30 seconds left in the first half and Washington leading 3-0. Glenn Brenner, Channel 9\u2032s sports director at the time, told The Post the station received more than 800 calls of protest.\n\n\n\nWashington's Diron Talbert sacks New England quarterback Steve Grogan. (AP) (Associated Press/Associated Press)\n\nThe Patriots took a 14-9 lead early in the fourth quarter on Grogan\u2019s second touchdown pass of the game, a 45-yard strike to Harold Jackson. New England was attempting to run out the clock with fewer than three minutes remaining when Dave Butz forced a fumble by running back Horace Ivory. The loose football bounced directly into the arms of linebacker Brad Dusek, a former New England third-round pick, who ran 31 yards and lunged across the goal line to give Washington the lead for good.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just happy I made it to the end zone without passing out,\u201d Dusek said after the Redskins held on for a 16-14 win.\n\n\u201cYou have to believe,\u201d Houston said.\n\n\n\n(The Washington Post) (TWP/TWP)\n\n\u201cThey just did a heck of a job stopping us,\u201d said Grogan, who threw a pair of interceptions. \u201cThey just seemed to know what we were going to do before we did it. I don\u2019t know how, but they did.\u201d\n\nOne possible explanation? The Redskins had a copy of the Patriots\u2019 game plan, as CBS commentator Paul Hornung reported during the broadcast of Washington\u2019s win over the Eagles the following week. A Redskins team source told The Post that a list of Patriots plays was discovered in the visitors\u2019 locker room at Schaefer Stadium, but Pardee would initially neither confirm nor deny that his players had access to such intelligence.\n\n\u201cHow do you stop New England\u2019s running game?\u201d Pardee said when asked after the Eagles game about CBS\u2019s report. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you have the plays or not. \u2026 If you got the playbook, what the hell are you going to do with it? It\u2019s not even worthy of comment. I don\u2019t know where [Hornung] got his information.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first I\u2019ve heard about it,\u201d Redskins tight end Jean Fugett said. \u201cEven if it was true, though, how do you know the Patriots didn\u2019t slip a fake one in there. Isn\u2019t that possible, too?\u201d\n\nA few days later, Pardee admitted that the Redskins had found \u201ca scratchy piece of paper\u201d in the visitors\u2019 locker room an hour before kickoff against the Patriots, but said it was \u201call but useless.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know their terminology or anything else,\u201d Pardee told The Post. \u201cIt gave no situations, no first and 10, second and short. It was just a scratchy piece of paper full numbers, and with us not knowing the code.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins started 6-0 in 1978, but finished 8-8 and missed the playoffs. The Patriots rebounded from their Week 1 loss to win the AFC East with an 11-5 record before losing to Houston in the divisional round.\n\nSince 1978, Week 1 underdogs of nine points or greater are 14-45 straight up and 34-23-2 against the spread. The Eagles are 3-0 when favored by at least nine points in Week 1 during that time, and they covered the spread twice.\n\nRead more on the Redskins:\n\nCase Keenum is an unwanted QB who keeps winning jobs.
