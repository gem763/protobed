Scott Walker a $3 billion incentive package to bring Foxconn Technology Group of Taiwan to Wisconsin.\n\nThe governor and his fellow Republicans who control the Legislature have rallied behind the legislation as a way to bring thousands of jobs to Wisconsin and transform the state\u2019s economy. Most Democrats have opposed it, saying it is too costly and includes too many environmental rollbacks for the technology company.\n\nThe Assembly approved the package 59-30 last month, but must take it up again because the Senate adopted changes to it on Tuesday under a deal between leaders from both chambers.\n\nIn the Senate, the deal \u2013 which is more than 10 times as big as any previous state subsidy to a private project in Wisconsin \u2013 passed 20-13, largely on party lines.\n\nCapital Times: Two months past deadline, Wisconsin Assembly approves state budget", "description": "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel:\u00a0Wisconsin Assembly set to approve $3 billion Foxconn .09/02/2019 3:19:13AM EST.", "authors": ["Watchdog News", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
