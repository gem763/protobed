But people have been searching the skies for signs of intelligent life since the 1960s and to date we have found\u2026 zero aliens.\n\nBut don\u2019t lose hope! The Universe is mind-bogglingly large, and with the latest technology, the search is only just starting to heat up.\n\nThere are three exciting ways we might detect life beyond Earth in the coming years.\n\nProbes to planets and moons\n\nThe first is by sending probes to planets and moons in the Solar system. We already know there isn\u2019t any other intelligent life in the Solar system, but there could be simpler life like microbes.\n\nYou may have heard about the NASA missions to Mars \u2013 the latest is the Curiosity Rover, and it has special equipment that might detect simple life like microbes on the red planet\u2019s surface.\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nCuriosity recently uncovered an intriguing mystery: occasionally its sensors pick up methane gas in the atmosphere. Methane is produced here on Earth by animals (in particular, cows and sheep), so finding methane could point to there being some microbes in the soil.\n\nThat would be an amazing discovery, but it could still be something less interesting, like a chemical reaction between rocks. Another upcoming mission is called Dragonfly, which will venture to Saturn\u2019s moon Titan (which, amazingly, has an atmosphere) and will fly around looking for signs of life.\n\nStudying the atmospheres of other star systems\n\nThe second way we might detect life is by looking closely at the atmospheres of planets in other star systems, which are called exoplanets.\n\nAstronomers have detected lots of exoplanets, and recently found water in the atmosphere of one exoplanet, but we still can\u2019t tell if there is life on the surface.\n\nExcitingly, the next generation of optical telescopes will be able to detect gases in the atmospheres of nearby exoplanets. If we see that an exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere has a mix of gases like Earth, that would be strong evidence that we are sharing the galaxy with other beings.\n\nThe search for extraterrestrial intelligence or \u2018SETI\u2019\n\nThe search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or \u201cSETI\u201d as it is known, is the third way scientists are looking for life. In SETI, we look for signals from space that look artificial or that don\u2019t seem natural. Detecting an artificial signal would tell us that there was not only life, but life capable of producing advanced technology.\n\nSETI could detect an artificial signal from much, much further away than the other two methods; the disadvantage is that intelligent life is almost certainly rarer. We just don\u2019t know yet how rare, and that\u2019s the reason we need to look.\n\nThe best explanation for why we haven\u2019t found life beyond Earth yet is simply that we haven\u2019t been looking hard and long enough, and our technology has not advanced enough. There are hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way alone, and there are more stars in the Universe than there are grains of sand here on Earth.\n\nAs SETI pioneer Jill Tarter is fond of saying:\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t dip a glass in the ocean, come up with no fish inside and conclude, \u2018No fish exist\u2019.\n\nThe tide pools and coral reefs of the Universe may be filled with life, we just need to keep dipping our glasses into the darkness.\n\nDanny C Price, Astrophysicist, Swinburne University of Technology\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.
