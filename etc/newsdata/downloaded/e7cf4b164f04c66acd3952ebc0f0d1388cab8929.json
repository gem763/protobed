Excluding the one-time charge, the bank's profit in the quarter was $7.5 billion, or 75 cents a share.\n\nThe results exceeded Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of five analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 50 cents per share.\n\nBank of America had to write off the value of its First Data partnership after First Data was acquired by Fiserv earlier this year. Both companies do payment processing for merchants at the point-of-sale.\n\nLow interest rates are taking a toll on the banking sector. Bank of America typically is invested in shorter-term bonds and securities, which are more impacted by the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. As rates rose the last two years, BofA benefited greatly, posting some of the best profit gains in the industry. But now that the trend is reversed.\n\nNet interest yield at BofA, which is how much spread the bank earns between what it costs to borrow and what rates it is lending to borrowers, declined 0.04 percentage points to 2.41%. Net interest income at BofA rose a modest 1% from a year earlier.\n\nThe bank was able to grow loans quite noticeably in the quarter, despite worries that businesses and consumers were slowing down in borrowing.\n\nLike other bank executives this quarter, BofA CEO Brian Moynihan appeared to be less optimistic in his comments about the economy.\n\n\"In a moderately growing economy, we focused on driving those things that are controllable,\" he said in a prepared statement.\n\nBefore the opening bell Wednesday, shares rose more than 2%.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nPortions of this story were generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.
