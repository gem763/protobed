It is your responsibility,\" she said, before handing the microphone to Alberto Fernandez.\n\nShe later posed for selfies on her way out of the arena, as supporters angled to get near her.\n\nBy far the biggest name in Argentina's Peronist movement, she stunned everyone in May by announcing she would run as the No. 2 on the presidential ticket of her former chief of staff, amid concerns her divisive image would drive away key centrist voters.\n\nA political powerhouse for more than two decades, her star rose as Argentina's charismatic first lady during the 2003-2007 presidency of her husband, Nestor Kirchner, whom she succeeded, and who died in 2010.\n\nHer second term ended in 2015, amid accusations by critics she was a authoritarian populist who had bankrupted Argentina's economy with welfare spending and graft. She still faces a series of legal cases over graft accusations, which she denies.\n\nShe famously refused to attend Macri's inauguration and hand over the presidential baton and sash after the two clashed over where the ceremony should take place.\n\nThe surprise tactic of taking the deputy role has worked. Fernandez's star power added glamour to the low-key Peronist ticket and helped tap into popular anger with Macri's administration, as high inflation and an anemic economy have pushed many Argentines into poverty.\n\nNow voters and investors are bracing for Cristina's return. Many believe she will have significant sway behind the scenes, though her party has played this down.\n\n\"This is Cristina. It's unrealistic to expect her to be invisible for long,\" said Benjamin Gedan, director of the Wilson Center's Argentina Project in Washington.\n\n\"Based on everything we know about her history and personality, she is likely to want to be a major figure in Argentine politics once again.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCUSHIONED BY MODERATE PRESIDENT?\n\nDuring the campaign she kept to the sidelines, instead promoting her memoir \"Sincerely\" on a book tour that drew huge crowds. Her Twitter feed, normally inflammatory and quick to jab at opponents, has been muted.\n\nInvestors said they hoped her role would be cushioned with more moderate Alberto Fernandez as president.\n\nBut some are holding their breath to see if she will assume greater prominence in the new government, said Ilya Gofshteyn, a senior emerging markets strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York.\n\nInvestors haven't forgotten Argentina's economic woes under Cristina, when a row with bondholders eventually forced the country into technical default in 2014, but have listened to Alberto Fernandez's subtle signals about a more moderate tack.\n\n\"Markets, for the most part, are willing to give the Fernandez ticket the benefit of the doubt,\" said Gofshteyn, adding people hoped that \"Cristina is not going to be the one in the driver's seat\".\n\nHe added, \"But, longer term, that is absolutely the threat hanging over the Argentine political system.\"\n\nThe ex-president is loved and hated in almost equal measure by voters too.\n\n\"I'm terrified of the Fernandezes,\" said Marissa Misischia, 52, a psychologist, as she went to vote for Macri in Buenos Aires on Sunday, referring to the running mates who share a name but are unrelated. \"Cristina destroyed the economy in the past.\"\n\nCarlos Berenguer, a 71-year-old retiree, on his way out of the polls in Buenos Aires, said he hoped Cristina would set the tone for the new government.", "description": "Argentina's former president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, a rockstar politician adored by the poor but feared by big business and investors, is back, although as vice president this time.
