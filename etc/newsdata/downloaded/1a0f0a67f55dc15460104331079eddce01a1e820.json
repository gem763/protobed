It\u2019s Me, Chelsea was, in fact, made into a 2012 NBC sitcom starring Laura Prepon, Lauren Lapkus and Ali Wong. The loosely autobiographical sitcom was canceled after one season, but Universal TV is now bellying up to the bar and ordering a new TV adaptation of a Chelsea memoir, having bought the rights to her 2019 book Life Will Be the Death of Me. Over in the unscripted realm, Handler\u2019s documentary Hello Privilege. It\u2019s Me, Chelsea debuted on Netflix on September 13.\n\nUnlike Are You There, Chelsea?, Death of Me reportedly recounts Handler\u2019s recent \u201cyear of self-discovery\u2014featuring a nerdily brilliant psychiatrist, a shaman, four Chow Chows, some well-placed security cameras, various family members (living and departed), friends, assistants and a lot of edibles.\u201d So, basically an Eat Pray Love, minus the \u2018Pray,\u2019 and with \u2018Eat\u2019 mostly referring to weed Rice Krispies treats.
