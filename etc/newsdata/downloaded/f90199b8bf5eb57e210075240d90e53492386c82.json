But the arraignment for the two main players in the indictment, Parnas and Fruman -- who were originally scheduled to appear in court with the other two -- has been delayed until next week.\n\nAram Roston/Reuters\n\nSince the indictment, Giuliani has acknowledged receiving $500,000 in payments for work he did with Parnas. Giuliani told ABC News that he was retained by Parnas' business \"Fraud Guarantee\" to do consulting work and insisted that any money he took came from domestic, not foreign sources.\n\nTrump has denied knowing Parnas and Fruman specifically, though he is pictured with the two at multiple events. Fruman and Parnas have reportedly played a significant role in helping with Giuliani's efforts in Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden.\n\nThe indictment outlines a \"foreign national donor scheme\" alleging the men \"conspired to circumvent the federal law against foreign influence by engaging in a scheme to funnel foreign money to candidates.\" The indictment, details how the four defendants allegedly funneled \"$1-2 million\" from a Russian donor into the U.S. political system between June 2018 and April of this year.\n\nAdditionally, Parnas and Fruman allegedly made a series of illegal straw donations that included a $325,000 donation to the pro-Trump Super PAC America First Action, and prosecutors allege that the two violated the law by falsely reporting the origin of those funds as under the name of their newly-created company Global Energy Producers.\n\nThe Campaign Legal Center via AP\n\nIn the indictment, prosecutors also outline an alleged scheme by Parnas and Fruman to raise $20,000 for a \"then-sitting U.S. Congressman,\" who \"had also been the beneficiary of approximately $3 million\" from America First Action during the 2018 midterms. According to the indictment, Parnas allegedly met with the congressman and sought his \"assistance in causing the U.S. government to remove or recall the then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine,\" Marie Yovanovitch.\n\nThe indictment doesn't name the congressman, but the description matches ABC News' reporting that Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, had benefited from $3 million in backing from the super PAC during the 2018 cycle, and that during the same month that Parnas raised funds for Sessions, Sessions wrote a letter calling for Yovanovitch's immediate removal.\n\nSessions has since been subpoenaed as part of the Southern District's probe and he told ABC News that he is fully cooperating with investigators.\n\nGiuliani is not named in the indictment, but as ABC News has previously reported, the business relationship between the president's personal lawyer and Parnas and Fruman is the subject of the ongoing criminal investigation being conducted by federal authorities in New York, with a primary focus on whether there were any criminal violations of the Foreign Agent Act in Giuliani's representation of foreign entities.\n\nFruman and Parnas were arrested last week at Dulles International Airport with one-way international tickets, according to a prosecutor from the Southern District of New York, where Parnas and Fruman face charges. It was later reported that the men had dined with Giuliani in the Trump International Hotel in Washington a few hours before their flight.\n\nSocial Media via Reuters\n\nThe two men appeared before a judge in the Eastern District of Virginia the next day, where the judge agreed to a bail package which included a $1 million bond for each defendant, the surrender of travel documents and passports, GPS monitoring and home detention.\n\nAs of Wednesday evening, Fruman had met the bond requirements and was no longer in the custody of the Alexandria, Virginia, jail. Parnas remained in custody.\n\nTheir appearance in New York on Thursday is expected to be a preliminary hearing. The men did not enter pleas during their last appearance before a judge in Virginia.", "description": "Individuals with ties to President Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani are expected to appear before a judge in the Southern District of New York on Thursday .", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/giuliani-parnas-rt-ps191010_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
