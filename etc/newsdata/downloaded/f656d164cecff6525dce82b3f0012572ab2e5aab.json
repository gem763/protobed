She talks about how she almost quit acting after Moonlight, the pain of her family\u2019s past and Bond getting woke\n\nLater this month, Naomie Harris appears in her first starring role in a film. She is 43. What has taken her so long? Not laziness. Harris has always been a grafter, acting on TV from the age of nine, saving every penny to pay for university (social and political science at Cambridge, one of only two black students in her year). The work ethic, she says, comes from her mother, who discovered she was pregnant when doing her A-levels and raised her daughter solo, funded by a job at the post office. She later went to university, worked as a scriptwriter on EastEnders and is now a reiki healer.\n\nSo, Harris is no slouch. But for years she told her agents: supporting roles only. No leads. \u201cI get consumed by the characters that I play, and acting is quite a stressful, adrenaline-inducing thing. So I didn\u2019t really know how well I would cope with being a lead. It was partly a confidence issue, as well. I just thought I\u2019d be biting off more than I could chew.\u201d\n\nWe meet at a photography studio, where Harris is dressed in a floor-sweeping powder-blue gown (\u201cdress\u201d really doesn\u2019t do it justice). When I walk in, she is comparing two croissants on the buffet table, one of them vegan, with a stylist: \u201cHi, we\u2019re doing a taste test,\u201d she says. Friendly and unpolished (she says \u201cbaddy\u201d instead of villain), she has the slight stiffness of the very shy.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Harris with Tyrese Gibson in Black and Blue: \u2018I hate guns, even when they\u2019re empty or have blanks.\u2019 Photograph: Alan Markfield/Sony\n\nHarris doesn\u2019t make many films. Not long after she left university, Danny Boyle took a chance on her in 28 Days Later. Two Pirates of the Caribbean movies followed. She was electric as Winnie Mandela opposite Idris Elba in Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. Her arrival as the brainy Eve Moneypenny dragged the sexual politics of the James Bond franchise into the 21st century. Finally, there was a female character who wouldn\u2019t hop into bed with 007 after a double vodka. (Harris insists on being referred to as a Bond woman rather than Bond girl.) Then came Moonlight, the film that earned her a first Oscar nomination, and for which she broke her golden career rule: to only make films with positive depictions of black women.\n\nWith her new film Black and Blue, the opportunity to play a role model is what grabbed her: \u201cA black female cop as the lead \u2013 we don\u2019t see that very often.\u201d The film is a popcorn thriller with important things to say about police brutality against African Americans and the role of bodycams in policing the police. Harris plays a newbie officer who captures footage of fellow officers executing drug dealers with her bodycam. The movie unfolds over one long night on the streets of New Orleans.\n\nHarris is an unlikely action hero: she hates guns. After three Bonds, she is still scared of picking one up, \u201ceven when it\u2019s empty or has blanks\u201d. And Black and Blue is a violent film. Her mum walked out halfway through: \u201cShe just couldn\u2019t take it, bless her.\u201d Harris kicks serious butt in the film, throwing burly men around; in one scene, she grabs a plank of wood to batter a bad guy senseless while unleashing a primal howl of fury. \u201cI don\u2019t actually like anger in everyday life,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m very, very sensitive. But I\u2019ve done enough kind of self-development work to realise that actually anger is a really important emotion that needs expression. Because I bottle mine up, I find it really cathartic to just let rip. So on set I\u2019m like: \u2018Yeah, give me that plank of wood. I\u2019m going to bash him up.\u2019 I let it all out.\u201d\n\nBlack and Blue marks Harris\u2019s return to acting after nearly packing it in \u2013 at the height of her success. It was mid-2017, and for months she had been living out of a suitcase on the campaign trail with Moonlight. Immediately after the Oscars, she flew to Atlanta to shoot action movie Rampage with Dwayne Johnson. Afterwards, back home in London, she told her agent not to send any scripts her way.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Harris in Moonlight, 2016: \u2018Once I connected to her pain, I could have empathy for her.\u2019 Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo\n\n\u201cI was completely burned out. I needed a break,\u201d she says. \u201cI was like: \u2018I don\u2019t want to be an actress any more.\u2019 I was thinking of opening a nail salon with my friend.\u201d Actually, the plan was a little more ambitious: creating an eco-friendly non-toxic nail polish with a designer pal. In the end, the wobble resolved itself, thanks in part to a month-long retreat to India where she spent her days doing yoga and meditating. After an eight-month sabbatical, she opened her inbox to find the script of Black and Blue.\n\nWhen her agents sent Harris the script of Moonlight, it was caveated with an apology. \u201cThey were like: \u2018I know this is a crack addict, so we\u2019re really hesitant to present this to you, but \u2026\u201d Harris is teetotal and has never taken drugs. At first, she worried about being able to pull off playing an addict. Then she started watching videos on YouTube, interviews with female addicts filmed in crack dens, all of whom had been sexually abused. \u201cEvery single one. Once I understood that, I was able to tap into her unresolved, unacknowledged pain. That\u2019s what drives her addiction and the addiction causes her to be a monster to her own child. Once I connected to her pain I could have empathy for her.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019s own mother, Lisselle, raised her daughter on her own in a council flat in Finsbury Park, London, and she has had little contact with her Trinidadian father. She and her mother remain close; she lives on the same street as her and her stepfather.\n\nHarris\u2019s personal life is not up for discussion \u2013 she doesn\u2019t have children and told a magazine that she is sick of people (friends as well as journalists) asking if she wants to start a family. Yet she appeared on the BBC genealogy show Who Do You Think You Are? earlier this year, in which she discovered she was descended from both slaves and a slave overseer. She showed a lovely photo of her with her maternal grandfather, who was a huge part of her upbringing and forever showing up with packets of flannels as presents.\n\nHarris remains very practical. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be sent a designer bag. I\u2019d rather be sent a vacuum cleaner. My mum gets me stainless steel pots for Christmas, or a salt grinder. I\u2019m like: \u2018Oh my God, amazing.\u2019\u201d\n\nSince the programme, there has been surprise that she knew so little about her past before. \u201cBut that\u2019s a first-generation and second-generation immigrant thing, to not explore the past because everything\u2019s focused on success, success, move forward, let\u2019s make a better life for the next generation.\u201d\n\nShe adds: \u201cThe past is also quite ugly and it\u2019s so painful because it\u2019s so recent, so you don\u2019t talk about it.\u201d Her mother, who arrived aged five from Jamaica, experienced \u201chorrendous\u201d racism, she says. It is something she worries is on the rise. \u201cI think it\u2019s very easy to excite in people racist tendencies.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Harris with Daniel Craig in Skyfall, 2012: \u2018We want a Bond that inhabits the qualities we associate with Bond.\u2019 Photograph: REX/Shutterstock\n\nHarris speaks carefully; she worries that opinions will get reduced to soundbites. In 2017, she told the Times that she had never experienced racism or sexism in the film industry. Today, she admits that is not quite true. In her mid-2os, she was groped by a very famous actor. \u201cI was in an audition and he put his hand up my skirt. What was so shocking about it was the casting director was there and the director, and of course no one said anything at all because he was \u2013 he is \u2013 such a huge star.\u201d In a way, she believes her Cambridge education protected her to some extent from misogyny in the film industry. \u201cI think there is the immediate assumption that you have a brain. Which is not necessarily true if you go to Oxbridge, as I\u2019ve discovered.\u201d\n\nTime\u2019s Up has seen a \u201cmassive shift\u201d, she thinks: \u201cMen know that they absolutely cannot get away with things now that they wouldn\u2019t even have thought about before.\u201d\n\nIncluding, it seems, 007. Next April will see the return of Harris as Eve Moneypenny in No Time to Die, alongside a newly woke James Bond, dialogue courtesy of Fleabag. Phoebe Waller-Bridge was brought on board at the 11th hour to jazz up the script \u2013 and, says Harris, even when she wasn\u2019t on the set, she was present. \u201cIf there was a problem with the script, then [director] Cary Fukunaga would always be like: \u2018OK, well, I\u2019ll just make a call to Phoebe.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe film is reportedly Daniel\u2019s Craig\u2019s final outing as Bond. One of the frontrunners to replace him, Cillian Murphy, recently ruled himself out by saying that 007 should go to a woman. When I put this to Harris, she gives what feels like a rehearsed line: \u201cI think we want a Bond that inhabits the qualities that we associate with Bond. Whatever sex that is, whatever race.\u201d\n\nMight Moneypenny take over? She splutters. Yet Black and Blue proves she can chuck a baddie over her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s weird. When I was watching it, I was like: \u2018Oh my gosh, I am an action hero in this movie. This is not how I envisioned my career at all.\u201d As for her conversations with agents, they\u2019ve taken a new direction. \u201cNow I\u2019m like \u2026\u201d \u2013 she puts on a diva trill \u2013 \u201c\u2018Leads only please.\u2019\u201d\n\nBlack and Blue is out on 25 October", "description": "Despite hating guns, Harris stars as a tough cop up for a fight in her new action thriller.
