They remain some of the most profitable banks in the world, but their earnings fell last year after facing low credit growth and billions of dollars in remediation costs from wrongdoings exposed by the wide-ranging Royal Commission inquiry.\n\nThe ACCC is due to deliver its preliminary report by March 30 and a final report by Sept. 30, 2020.\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg said the government needs information on the banks\u2019 funding costs to understand why they are not passing on rate cuts in full, after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said those funding costs have dropped.\n\nThe RBA has cut the official cash rate by 0.25% three times so far this year to a record low of 0.75% in a bid to stimulate consumption and investment in a slowing economy.\n\nIn response, Australia\u2019s \u201cBig Four\u201d lenders - Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ.AX), Westpac Banking Corp (WBC.AX), National Australia Bank (NAB.AX) and Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AX) - have cut customer\u2019s mortgage rates by about 0.57%, on average.\n\n\u201cThe government and the RBA itself have called on the banks to pass them on and the banks have just ignored that advice and that call,\u201d Frydenberg said in an interview on Australian Broadcasting Corp television.\n\nFrydenberg said he had spoken to bank chief executives about the inquiry and told them this was an opportunity for them to \u201cclear the air\u201d to explain why they haven\u2019t passed on rate cuts in full and how they balance the needs of customers and shareholders.\n\nHowever, Frydenberg said the government would not resort to levying a tax on banks if they refuse to pass on rate cuts in full and has previously ruled out legislating for the banks to pass on rate cuts in full.\n\nMARGIN PRESSURE\n\nA sustained ultra-low interest rates environment is weighing on bank\u2019s interest margins and analysts contacted by Reuters on Monday said bank earnings would drop if they were forced to pass on lower rates.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this will put more pressure on the banks to pass through a larger proportion of ... any further RBA movements,\u201d UBS analysts wrote in a note to clients.\n\n\u201cThis would further exacerbate the net interest margin, return on equity and dividend pressure the banks are facing in an ultra-low rate environment.\u201d\n\nCBA, the country\u2019s largest bank, said in a statement the inquiry is an \u201copportunity to gain a deeper understanding of how Australian banks are operating in a historically low interest rate environment.\u201d\n\nSmaller rival ANZ said the inquiry would be a chance \u201cto provide facts\u201d to customers about how their home loans are priced. NAB echoed CBA\u2019s comments on the challenges of ultra low interest rates, while a spokesman for Westpac did not return requests for comment.", "description": "The Australian government has ordered the competition watchdog to investigate why banks failed to pass three official interest rate cuts this year in full, less than a year after a public inquiry exposed the industry for cheating customers.", "authors": ["Sonali Paul", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
