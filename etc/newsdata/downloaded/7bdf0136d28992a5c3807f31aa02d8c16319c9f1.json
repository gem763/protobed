L\u2019Shana Tova U\u2019Metuka, have a happy sweet New Year.\u201d\n\nIn addition to dipping the apple in the honey, Jewish people also frequently eat honey cake, pomegranates and round raisin loaves of challah to see in the New Year.\n\nRead all about the foods that are traditionally served during Rosh Hashanah, from honey cake to a fish\u2019s head:\n\nApple and honey\n\nThe dipping of the apple in the honey is one of the most recognisable traditions associated with Rosh Hashanah.\n\nThe honey symbolises the excitement for a sweet New Year ahead.\n\nIt\u2019s believed that centuries ago, the apple was chosen as the fruit that was to be dipped into the honey on Rosh Hashanah due to the symbolic nature of the fruit.\n\nAccording to a Lexicon of Jewish Cooking, written by Patti Shosteck, in medieval times apples were so revered that people would carve prayers into the apple skins before eating them.\n\nPomegranate\n\nThe pomegranate is also a highly symbolic fruit eaten by the Jewish people during the New Year.\n\nThe Torah, the Jewish scroll that contains the first five books of the Tanakh, consists of 613 \u201cmitzvot\u201d, or commandments.\n\nThe Jewish Museum in New York City states that a pomegranate supposedly consists of 613 seeds, which is why it is eaten during Rosh Hashanah.\n\nOn top of that, it\u2019s also a sweet fruit, which is why it ties in nicely with the festival.\n\nJewish people also eat many other types of fruits during Rosh Hashanah, including dates, lychees and star fruits.\n\nRound raisin challah\n\nChallah is a special Jewish bread that is frequently eaten on Shabbat and during religious festivals.\n\nUsually challah loaves are plaited and adorned with different types of seeds, such as sesame or poppy seeds.\n\nHowever, when Rosh Hashanah comes around, round raisin challahs become especially popular as opposed to long, plaited variations.\n\nProject Genesis, a Jewish education organisation, recommends substituting the raisins for dried cranberries or sour cherries as an alternative to the raisin loaf.\n\nKiddush wine\n\nA Jewish celebration isn\u2019t complete without an abundance of kiddush wine to mark the occasion.\n\nA \u201ckiddush\u201d is a type of blessing recited over wine or grape juice during Shabbat or other Jewish festivals.\n\nKiddush wine is typically much sweeter than other types of wine.\n\nIt\u2019s explained on the Chabad website that during periods of time when Jewish communities were impoverished, many couldn\u2019t afford to buy expensive wine for Shabbat.\n\nTherefore, they would often have to resort to buying cheap, sweet wine that was sometimes made from raisins instead.\n\nHoney cake\n\nIt should come as no surprise that honey cake is eaten during Rosh Hashanah, what with the festival\u2019s focus on sweet food.\n\nMany Jewish people who make honey cake to celebrate the New Year will make batches that they will then give to friends and family to spread love and happiness during the festive occasion.\n\nThe cake\u2019s ingredients often include cinnamon, ginger and \u2013 of course \u2013 honey or syrup.\n\nFish head\n\nIt\u2019s customary for some Jewish people to eat the head of a fish during Rosh Hashanah.\n\nWhy, you may ask? The reasoning stems from the literal translation of the festival\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cSince \u2018Rosh Hashanah\u2019 translates literally as \u2018Head of the Year,\u2019 eating a fish head on the holiday became a little joke about the verse,\u201d explained Jeremy Kalmanofsky, rabbi of New York City\u2019s Conservative Ansche Chesed.\n\n\u201cYou should start your year as the head [or leader] and not the tail [or follower].\"", "description": "The\u00a0festival of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, is a joyous occasion celebrated by members of the religious community all over the world.
