Most of us will get between one and three colds each year, usually in autumn and winter, caused by one of more than 200 different cold viruses.\n\nAnd there is little you can do about it \u2014 a cure for the common cold remains one of the Holy Grails of medicine \u2014 but better understanding of how these viruses spread could be the key.\n\nWhat we do know for sure is that the first 24 hours are crucial; this is when the infection takes hold and starts to multiply, causing symptoms.\n\nHere, with the help of three leading experts \u2014 Professor John Oxford, a virologist at Queen Mary University of London, Professor Ron Eccles, director of the Common Cold Centre at Cardiff University and Professor Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London \u2014 we explain what is going on during the first 24 hours of your cold and what you can do to reduce the severity of your symptoms.\n\nA better understanding of how cold viruses spread could be the key to stopping a cold (stock image)\n\nThe first minutes\n\nCatching a cold is about a combination of factors coming together; not only do you need to come into contact with the virus \u2014 for example, from a sneeze or a bug your child picked up at school \u2014 but the virus must also overcome your body\u2019s own defences.\n\nA single sneeze contains hundreds of millions of virus particles known as virions \u2014 each of which can trigger a cold.\n\nEven those viruses that do reach the upper respiratory tract \u2014 the nose, mouth, throat and voice box \u2014 face another almost insurmountable obstacle (stock image)\n\n\u2018Depending on how far you are away from the sneeze, you may breathe in 10,000 virus particles, but only a few hundred will land on the exposed epithelial cells of the nose, throat and upper airway. These virus cells have evolved to invade the epithelial cells if they get the chance,\u2019 says Professor Oxford.\n\nThe invading virus\u2019s first hurdle is to run the gauntlet of the cilia, tiny hair-like cells dotted throughout the nasal cavity that move in a rhythm to sweep mucus and viruses down the throat and swallowed out of harm\u2019s way.\n\nMany millions of virus particles are also trapped in saliva and swallowed away.\n\nA hot drink such as honey and lemon will provide immediate relief from a sore throat and cough,\u2019 says Professor Oxford (stock image)\n\nEven those viruses that do reach the upper respiratory tract \u2014 the nose, mouth, throat and voice box \u2014 face another almost insurmountable obstacle. The epithelial cells that line these airways are so tightly bonded together, they usually provide an impermeable seal which keeps infections at bay.\n\n\u2018These cells also have sensors on their surface that detect the presence of hostile viruses and rapidly send messages to the cell to produce cytokines, chemical messengers that call in help from white blood cells and can also destroy the viruses themselves,\u2019 says Professor Oxford.\n\nA cure for the common cold remains one of the Holy Grails of medicine (stock image)\n\n\u2018These stimulate the movement of virus-killing immune cells to sites of infection.\u2019 However, when we are over-tired, stressed or our immune systems are weaker than normal, cold viruses can get a foothold as these systems slow.\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO: Wash your hands using soap and water at regular intervals. Avoid rubbing your eyes with your hands, as this can transmit infection.\n\n1 to 2 hours\n\nBy now the first symptoms \u2014 nasal dryness and irritation may be developing as the epithelial layer starts to break down. \u2018Cold viruses disrupt and weaken the impermeable barrier by producing chemicals to open up the tight junctions between the epithelial cells, allowing viruses to penetrate to deeper within the airways,\u2019 says Professor Oxford.\n\nApplying a warm compress can provide relief \u2014 a clean flannel dipped into hot water and wrung out will do. Or take a painkiller such as ibuprofen (stock image)\n\nWhere they settle depends on the type of virus that has infected you. Some viruses prefer the warmer environment of the upper lungs where it is 37c, while others focus on the nose and throat, partly because they prefer the lower 32c up there. That\u2019s why some colds tend to cause more nasal symptoms,\u2019 says Professor Openshaw.\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO: Some over-the-counter remedies may help your body stop the cold in its tracks at this early stage, according to studies. Vicks First Defence claims to reduce the chance of a full-blown cold by up to 50 per cent if taken at the first sign of symptoms, and can cut the severity of those symptoms by 40 per cent.\n\nThis viscous gel, works by trapping the virus and helping the body remove it. Professor Eccles says: \u2018The concept is interesting and worth a try. The evidence for its effectiveness is not black and white, but it is supportive.\u2019\n\n2 to 9 hours\n\nThose viruses that have managed to overcome the body\u2019s natural defences will start to infiltrate epithelial cells and replicate. \u2018The speed of replication is astonishing,\u2019 says Professor Oxford. \u2018One infected cell becomes a factory for the viruses and can make millions of viruses within ten hours.\u2019 You may also feel tired as your body gears up to fight infection, so rest is a good idea.\n\nIn the first 24 hours, the infection takes hold and starts to multiply, causing symptoms (stock image)\n\n10 hours\n\nVicks First Defence claims to reduce the chance of a full-blown cold by up to 50 per cent if taken at the first sign of symptoms\n\nIt is now, as the virus infects more and more cells, that symptoms start to appear in earnest. As the virus invades nasal cells, these respond by producing chemicals including histamine and leukotrienes, part of the body\u2019s natural immune response. Within hours, these chemicals are irritating and inflaming the lining of the nose, triggering sneezing \u2014 in an attempt to dislodge the virus.\n\nThe rest of the immune system also steps up its defences; white blood cells \u2014 the body\u2019s guardians that can destroy invaders \u2014 start pouring in from around the body, and lymph nodes in the armpit and neck step up production of the white blood cells, so become swollen and painful to the touch.\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO: Applying a warm compress can provide relief \u2014 a clean flannel dipped into hot water and wrung out will do. Or take a painkiller such as ibuprofen.\n\n11 hours\n\nCold viruses are now heavily established in the deeper levels of the epithelial cells and are moving through the bloodstream starting to interfere with the way cells work and creating symptoms like muscle ache. In particular, they affect genes that control cells in the nose and upper airway which produce and release mucus, causing over production as a way to ensure they can spread through airborne droplets \u2014 which is why people develop streaming noses and congestion in the sinuses.\n\nChicken soup, hailed for hundreds of years as a cold remedy, might help. A U.S. study in 2000 found that chicken soup dampened down the movement on neutrophils \u2014 a type of white blood cell \u2014 suggesting it could be anti-inflammatory (stock image)\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO: Don\u2019t blow your nose too hard, which can drive infection into the canal that connects the upper throat, nasal cavity and ears, leading to infection.\n\n12 hours\n\nCoughing occurs when tiny nerve cells in the lining of the respiratory tract \u2014 known as pulmonary irritant receptors \u2014 become sensitised by too much mucus. These send messages via the vagus nerve in the chest to the brain, which in turn orders the diaphragm and intercostal muscles between the ribs to contract violently, causing explosive coughing. \u2018Coughing actually has an important purpose,\u2019 says Professor Eccles. \u2018It\u2019s your body\u2019s way of keeping unwanted stuff from getting into your lungs.\u2019\n\nThe force of coughing rapidly damages the fragile epithelial lining of the respiratory tract, causing it to slough off and exacerbates a sore throat.\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO: \u2018A hot drink such as honey and lemon will provide immediate relief from a sore throat and cough,\u2019 says Professor Oxford. Gargling salt water may help to ease symptoms of a sore throat by reducing inflammation.\n\nU.S. study in 2000 found that classic remedy chicken soup dampened down the movement on neutrophils \u2014 a type of white blood cell \u2014 suggesting it could be anti-inflammatory (stock image)\n\n15 hours\n\nAs mucus builds, coughing and sneezing intensifies. \u2018Mucus is an irritant but also blocks the airway so you have to cough to breathe,\u2019 explains Professor Oxford.\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO: Take cough remedies that contain expectorants to break up excess mucus. \u2018Use decongestants to relieve sinus pressure and ibuprofen to bring the temperature down.\u2019\n\n\u2018Wash your hands often, particularly after using public transport, and avoid rubbing your eyes and nose because infection can spread through hand-to-hand contact and even touching an infected surface,\u2019 advises Professor Oxford (stock image)\n\n18 hours\n\nDehydration caused by mucus production and a higher body temperature (when we are sick, the hypothalamus in the brain may set the body to a higher temperature, thought to help kill off the virus) can lead to hoarseness, dry lips and tongue. A build-up of chemicals produced to help the body fight infection can also cause headaches. \u2018As these proteins pass through the blood brain barrier, they have a toxic effect,\u2019 explains Professor Oxford.\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO: Chicken soup, hailed for hundreds of years as a cold remedy, might help. A U.S. study in 2000 found that chicken soup dampened down the movement on neutrophils \u2014 a type of white blood cell \u2014 suggesting it could be anti-inflammatory.\n\nFor most, however, cold symptoms peak within three days. \u2018After that, most immune systems can start to turn the tide on the virus and wipe it out, but not without millions of white cells being killed by the virus in the process (stock image)\n\n24 hours plus\n\nA small proportion of people will go on to develop more serious problems \u2014 around one in 100 will get a more serious secondary bacterial infection in the lungs that can cause pneumonia, says Professor Eccles. Congestion and build-up of mucus in the sinuses and eustachian tubes can cause a bacterial infection of the middle ear, or sinusitis.\n\nFor most, however, cold symptoms peak within three days. \u2018After that, most immune systems can start to turn the tide on the virus and wipe it out, but not without millions of white cells being killed by the virus in the process. This is possibly why mucus tends to get thicker and take on a greenish tinge,\u2019 says Professor Openshaw. \u2018That\u2019s usually when you start to feel better.\u2019\n\nPROTECT YOURSELF\n\n\u2018Wash your hands often, particularly after using public transport, and avoid rubbing your eyes and nose because infection can spread through hand-to-hand contact and even touching an infected surface,\u2019 advises Professor Oxford.\n\nHowever, taking vitamin C or echinacea to prevent a cold, or sleeping in a different bed from your partner if they have a cold, won\u2019t make any difference, he says, since you are living in close proximity to them.", "description": "A better understanding of how cold viruses spread could be the key to stopping a cold.
