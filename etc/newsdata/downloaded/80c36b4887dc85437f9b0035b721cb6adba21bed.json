Or Alabama. Or Georgia.\n\nThe Louisiana legislature is halfway toward passing a law \u2014 like the ones enacted in Mississippi and Georgia \u2014 that will ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, about six weeks into a pregnancy and before many women know they\u2019re pregnant. Alabama is on the cusp of approving an even more restrictive bill.\n\nState governments are on a course to virtually eliminate abortion access in large chunks of the Deep South and Midwest. Ohio and Kentucky also have passed heartbeat laws; Missouri\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature is considering one.\n\nState governments are on a course to virtually eliminate abortion access in large chunks of the Deep South and Midwest.\n\nTheir hope is that a more conservative U.S. Supreme Court will approve, spelling the end of the constitutional right to abortion.\n\n\u201cFor pro-life folks, these are huge victories,\u201d said Sue Liebel, state director for the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion advocacy group. \u201cAnd I think they\u2019re indicative of the momentum and excitement and the hope that\u2019s happening with changes in the Supreme Court and having such a pro-life president.\u201d\n\nFor abortion rights supporters, meanwhile, the trend is ominous. Said Diane Derzis, owner of Mississippi\u2019s sole abortion clinic, the Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization: \u201cI think it\u2019s certainly more dire than it ever has been. They smell blood and that\u2019s why they\u2019re doing this.\u201d\n\nAlready, Mississippi mandates a 24-hour wait between an in-person consultation. That means women must make at least two trips to her clinic, often traveling long distances.\n\nOther states have passed similar, incremental laws restricting abortion in recent years, and aside from Mississippi, five states have just one clinic \u2014 Kentucky, Missouri, North and South Dakota, and West Virginia. But the latest efforts to bar the procedure represent the largest assault on abortion rights in decades.\n\nLawmakers sponsoring the bans have made it clear their goal is to spark court challenges in hopes of ultimately overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion.\n\nThose challenges have begun. Derzis\u2019 attorneys are scheduled to go before a judge on May 21, seeking to prevent Mississippi\u2019s heartbeat law from taking effect July 1.\n\nA judge in Kentucky blocked enforcement of that state\u2019s heartbeat ban after the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit on behalf of the clinic in Louisville.\n\nSimilar legal action is expected before bans can take effect in Ohio and Georgia, where Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed the latest heartbeat bill into law Tuesday. Kemp said he welcomed the fight, vowing: \u201cWe will not back down.\u201d\n\nGeorgia\u2019s ban doesn\u2019t take effect until Jan. 1. But the impact was immediate.\n\nAn abortion clinic operated by The Women\u2019s Centers in Atlanta began receiving anxious calls from patients soon after Kemp signed the law. Many callers had plans to travel from outside the state for abortions. Georgia\u2019s heartbeat ban would have a wider impact because the state has 17 abortion clinics \u2014 more than the combined total in the other four Southern states that have passed or are considering bans.\n\n\u201cOn a typical day we will see people from North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, South Carolina \u2014 all over the region,\u201d said Dr. Lisa Haddad, the Atlanta clinic\u2019s medical director. \u201cAnd my thought is we\u2019re not going to see those people coming here because they assume it\u2019s already illegal in Georgia.\u201d\n\nDr. Ernest Marshall, co-founder of Kentucky\u2019s last remaining abortion clinic in Louisville, said in an email that banning abortions before most women know they\u2019re pregnant would \u201chave a disproportionate impact on poor women and communities of color throughout the South.\u201d\n\nAdvocates for abortion rights expect judges to halt enforcement of any new bans while lawsuits work their way through the courts. That could take years.\n\n\u201cThese laws are blatantly unconstitutional,\u201d said Elisabeth Smith, chief counsel for state policy and advocacy for the Center for Reproductive Rights, which also has filed suit over Mississippi\u2019s ban. \u201cBut if they were allowed to go into force, they would have devastating consequences for the residents of all of these states.\u201d\n\nIf heartbeat bans are upheld, many women who are poor and have limited means to travel would have few options other than to try to terminate their own pregnancies, Haddad said, possibly using abortion drugs purchased online.\n\nOthers would have to drive or fly across multiple states, said Elizabeth Nash, a state policy analyst for the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.\n\n\u201cPeople would go to Florida, people would continue to go to Memphis,\u201d Nash said. \u201cHow many states do you have to cross before you can access abortion services? It exacerbates all the issues we\u2019ve already seen around taking time off from work and having the money to travel.\u201d\n\nProposed heartbeat bans failed to pass this year in several Republican-led states, including Texas. There, GOP lawmakers lost ground to Democrats in the 2018 elections, and some abortion foes were wary after courts struck down prior abortion restrictions in the state. Such efforts also fell short in Florida, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia.\n\nAlabama lawmakers postponed until next week a vote on a proposal that would make performing nearly all abortions a felony. The measure has passed the state House, and the Senate suspended debate Thursday amid a heated dispute over whether exemptions for rape and incest should be stripped from the bill.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t put a price on unborn life,\u201d Eric Johnston, president of the Alabama Pro-Life Coalition, said Wednesday, as a legislative committee heard testimony on the state\u2019s proposed ban. \u201cWhat you have to do is protect the people that live in this state and that includes unborn children.\u201d\n\nBut Jenna King-Shepherd told Alabama lawmakers she believed the abortion she had at age 17 allowed her to finish college. She said her father, a part-time Baptist preacher furious about her pregnancy, drove her to the abortion clinic because he trusted her to make the right choice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to support access to abortion,\u201d King-Shepherd said. \u201cI\u2019m only asking you to let women, their families, their physicians and their God make this decision on how they want to start their families in private and trust them to do that.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press writers Kim Chandler in Montgomery, Alabama, and Bruce Schreiner in Frankfort, Kentucky, contributed to this report.", "description": "State governments are on a course to virtually eliminate abortion access in large chunks of the Deep South and Midwest.", "authors": ["Russ Bynum", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2019/04/abortion_2016-07-14T120000Z_62785419_S1AETPOYRNAA_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-REPUBLICANS-1024x683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-12"}
