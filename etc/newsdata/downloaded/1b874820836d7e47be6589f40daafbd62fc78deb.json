The longest single period without any available ambulances lasted seven hours and 40 minutes.\n\nIt's a problem the city's paramedic service has grappled with for years, but it's getting worse, according to emergency and protective services manager Anthony Di Monte.\n\nDi Monte said the root of the problem lies in the city's understaffed emergency rooms, and he said the results can be deadly.\n\n\"Mortality and morbidity is increasing as a result of off-load delays,\" Di Monte said.\n\nHospital drop-offs taking longer\n\nWhen a paramedic team drops a patient off at the hospital, they aim to transfer care to hospital staff within 30 minutes. But in Ottawa, it's taking closer to one hour and 20 minutes.\n\nAt The Ottawa Hospital, which includes the Civic and General campuses, it takes even longer: more than 90 minutes, or three times the target time.\n\nWhat's more, the off-load delays are increasing. In the first seven months of 2019, Ottawa hospitals saw a 12.5 per cent bump in the length of time ambulances are spending waiting at the ER over last year.\n\nThat means fewer ambulances available to respond when someone calls 911, and Di Monte said there's only so much the city and its paramedic service can do.\n\n\"It's very frustrating because we don't have the levers of control,\" he said.\n\nAnthony Di Monte is Ottawa's general manager of emergency and protective services. (CBC)\n\nThe delays are growing despite special funding from the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care to dedicate nurses to receive patients more quickly. Those nurses can only treat certain types of patients, according to the city's report.\n\nMayor Jim Watson has met with Health Minister Christine Elliott to press her to recruit more nurses to fill critical vacancies in local hospitals.\n\nIn September, the government announced an additional $424,000 toward additional nurses to help with off-loading patients.\n\nNew plan in the works\n\nDi Monte said the short-term solution is clear, but it's up to hospitals to implement it.\n\n\"Stop keeping our staff as hostages,\" he said. \"You can do that tomorrow morning by hiring who you have to hire, whether it's a nurse or some other staff, so that when we arrive the patients are off-loaded from our stretcher.\"\n\nCity officials are negotiating with The Ottawa Hospital to try some new ideas to get ambulances back on the streets so they can respond to calls.\n\nOne idea is to station a paramedic at the hospital emergency room where they can care for up to five patients at a time until they're admitted. The hospital is looking for money from the Champlain Local Health Integration Network to give that a try.", "description": "For a period totalling more than five days over the first eight months of this year, there were no ambulances available to respond to medical emergencies, according to a new report released by the City of Ottawa.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4264948.1503928940!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ottawa-paramedics-ambulance.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
