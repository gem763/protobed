He said that at least 38 people had been wounded in Conakry and Mamou.\n\n\"We encourage citizens to continue to demonstrate - today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow - until our legitimate demands are satisfied,\" he said. \"We need a clear, firm and irrevocable declaration from Alpha Conde renouncing a third term.\"\n\nIn a statement, rights group Amnesty International said it condemned the four deaths in the capital and urged the security forces to \"refrain from using excessive and deadly force\" and urged authorities to release \"people arbitrarily arrested for organising the protests\".\n\nSix opposition figures were arrested ahead of the protests on Monday, the first in a series of planned demonstrations, with an alliance of opposition parties and civil society groups known as the National Front for the Defence of the Constitution (FNDC) calling for a significant turnout.\n\nA small number of people took part in scattered demonstrations across the capital, Conakry, but security was out in force, breaking up makeshift barricades and making some arrests as protesters burned tyres and threw stones.\n\nAl Jazeera's Nicolas Haque, reporting from Conakry, said the usually bustling city centre resembled a ghost town, with most people choosing to stay indoors to avoid danger.\n\nThe opposition leaders calling for the protests were blocked from leaving their homes on Monday.\n\nElections loom\n\nThe protests, which Haque said are taking place throughout the country, are in response to fears that President Conde may be planning to seek a third term in office.\n\nThe 81-year-old became West Africa's first democratically-elected president in 2010, ending two years of military rule and raising hopes for democratic progress in Guinea, which was governed by President Lansana Conte for nearly a quarter of a century until his death in 2008.\n\n190901192449519\n\nConde was an opposition leader during Conte's rule, but his own tenure has been marred by a crackdown on protests.\n\nLast month, he called on the public to prepare for a referendum and elections, stirring speculation that he is planning to overcome a constitutional bar on a third term.\n\nThe next presidential ballot is due to be held late next year.\n\n\"Many of the protesters here are young, they want to see change and despite economic growth, they want more political freedom and want their voices heard and that's why they've taken to the streets,\" Haque said.", "description": "Demonstrators are worried that President Alpha Conde is planning to amend the constitution to stay in power.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/14/ab40538752194bb2904d696c3af011b2_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
