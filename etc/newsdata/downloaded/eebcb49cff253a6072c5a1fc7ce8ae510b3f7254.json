He's come from another league, he's young.\n\n'There's this price tag that he has not put on himself, people have put that on him because of his performances.\n\n'So you've got to give him time for him to reproduce that, it's not going to come like that.'\n\nAnd Zaha is fully confident that Pepe will come good if he is given time to produce his best form at the Emirates.\n\nPepe arrived with plenty of expectation from Lille but is yet to find his feet in north London\n\n'I have got nothing but faith in him, I've got confidence that he will produce the same thing that he did before,' he continued.\n\n'Because we both play for Ivory Coast, I've seen the talent he's got, but not everyone sees it.'\n\nZaha made it known that he wanted to leave Palace in the summer and as a boyhood Arsenal fan, wanted to join the Gunners when they bid \u00a340million for him.\n\nBut the 26-year-old was too valuable to the Eagles to accept that price and he remains with Roy Hodgson's side.\n\nPalace are sixth in the Premier League after eight games.", "description": "Wilfried Zaha has urged frustrated Arsenal fans to be patient with Nicolas Pepe.\u00a0The winger signed from Lille for \u00a372million in the summer but has struggled to make a significant impact.", "authors": ["Will Griffee For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/17/19501190-0-image-a-9_1570638407010.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
