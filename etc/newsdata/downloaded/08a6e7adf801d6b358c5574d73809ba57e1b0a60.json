USA TODAY\n\nThere is no nightmare in baseball, no feeling of competitive vulnerability, quite like seeing your pitcher getting peppered by a lineup that knows exactly what pitch is coming.\n\nIt is a nightmare Andy Pettitte lived in Game 6 of the 2001 World Series, when the Arizona Diamondbacks trucked him for six runs in two-plus innings of a 15-2 victory, a pounding they later acknowledged came with the benefit of tipped pitches.\n\nIt is a nightmare Tampa Bay Rays starter Tyler Glasnow lived earlier this month, when he yielded hits to five of the first six Houston Astros in a winner-take-all Game 5 of the American League Division Series and later said it was \u201cpretty obvious\u201d he was tipping his pitches based on the position he held his glove.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a nightmare Stephen Strasburg endured for two grim starts against Arizona that sullied an otherwise impeccable 2019 resume, before he and pitching coach Paul Menhart discovered and, so they believe, swept up the bread crumbs the Diamondbacks followed to hit him hard.\n\nASTROS: Altuve plays hero again as Houston gets back to Fall Classic\n\n'FAILURE': Yankees have nothing to show for another great season\n\nNow, Strasburg and the Nationals are heading into the belly of the beast: A World Series date with the Houston Astros, who not only are perhaps the most talented team in baseball but also carry the reputation as the most resourceful at gleaning advantages near the margins of ethical competition.\n\nGiven the mini-storm that passed through the AL Championship Series, when a published report raised the fairly absurd notion that Astros in the dugout were passing on the Yankees\u2019 signs via whistle, it\u2019s safe to say the Astros don\u2019t need to do much to get into their opponents\u2019 heads.\n\nThe Nationals know it\u2019s wiser to check themselves rather than get caught up in Astro Paranoia.\n\nNationals pitcher Patrick Corbin has a meeting on the mound during Game 4 of the NLCS.

From pitch-tipping to sign-stealing to pitchouts \u2013 you name it.\n\n\u201cThis game is seen by a lot more people than a regular season game. Way more eyes. It\u2019s just the nature of it.\u201d\n\nWay more than eyes, too.\n\nMajor League Baseball launched an investigation during the 2018 ALCS between Houston and Boston Red Sox when an Astros employee was observed in the camera well aiming a lens at the Red Sox dugout and sending text messages. The same activity was observed in the preceding ALDS against Cleveland and the employee was removed from the area in both instances.\n\nUltimately, MLB determined that the employee was \u201cplaying defense\u201d \u2013 in other words, checking to see if the Red Sox were picking up the Astros\u2019 signs \u2013 rather than trying to steal the opponent\u2019s signals.\n\nThe Astros received a hollow bit of vindication \u2013 \u201cA person was (still) in a credentialed (area) that shouldn\u2019t have been there,\u201d Red Sox GM Dave Dombrowski noted at the time \u2013 but also a rep for pushing the rules in an era MLB is determined to crack down on digital chicanery.\n\nThe need for vigilance was magnified in 2017, when a Red Sox trainer was caught using an Apple Watch to relay signs from the team\u2019s replay assistants to batters. Now, replay assistants are monitored by a security official; they are ostensibly the only ones with access to a live broadcast, as other TVs are required to be set on a several-second delay.\n\nThat was perhaps the most notable advancement in a five-page memo MLB circulated in February in its effort to lend clarity in a digital era that still doesn\u2019t frown upon \u201cethically obtained\u201d signs.\n\n\u201cI think MLB has done an incredible job this year,\u201d Astros starter Justin Verlander said before his Game 5 start in the ALCS. \u201cThere's been someone in the video room every game of the season, somebody is there full-time. You're not allowed to have a live feed anywhere in the stadium that the players have access to; they check all that.\n\n\u201cI think that's been an incredible step forward for MLB to go against the trend of all this technology that's out there. That's pretty much it. They did what I think was the best thing possible to resolve whatever issue, paranoia teams have. Obviously, it didn't resolve the paranoia, it's still out there for every team.\u201d\n\nIncluding Verlander, who, at 36, finds himself changing sign sequences more than ever.\n\n\u201cI understand where the paranoia comes from. We have it. I have it,\u201d he says. \u201cThere's just so many cameras and there's so much video now, it just kind of evolved a few years ago. You've got teams studying what signs you use at second base before you even step on the mound. It used to be kind of a gamesmanship thing, runner gets on second base and if he's able to decipher your signs the time he's on second base, that's OK, good for you.\n\n\u201cBut if you're pre-studying them or having some person study them before you even get out there and all of a sudden you take the field and the team already knows what you're using, I think that's a little bit different.\u201d\n\nMenhart agrees. The probing eyes \u2013 and lenses \u2013 make everybody\u2019s job a lot more complicated. Whatever moral dilemmas that arise quickly fade in a cutthroat competitive environment.\n\n\u201cSome of it\u2019s helpful,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you can gain an advantage from it, it\u2019s all part of the game. But I wish there was no such thing as that. I wish we could play the game without relying on machines and things that can pick up tipping.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a purist. I like people to go out and battle and not try to gain an advantage unnaturally.\u201d\n\nNationals right-hander Anibal Sanchez, their likely starter in Game 4, said a coach helped him diagnose a pitch-tipping tic in 2012, when he held his glove near his chest in a set position. Shortly thereafter, he made an adjustment, holding the glove closer to his belt, and he\u2019s had no problems \u2013 that he knows of - since.\n\nStrasburg was forced to diagnose a problem earlier this year, too, when, in two starts against the Diamondbacks, he gave up 18 hits and 15 earned runs in 9 2/3 innings \u2013 a 13.98 ERA. His ERA in his other 31 starts: 2.80.\n\n\u201cYou feel for him,\u201d Menhart says of a pitcher laid bare by tipped pitches. \u201cBecause it\u2019s such a bad feeling as a pitcher when you know the other team knows what you\u2019re throwing. Your mind starts racing and it doesn\u2019t really matter. You overdo it, you tinker around and start doing other stuff, and you totally get out of your game.\u201d\n\nNow, the two deepest and most dominant rotations in the major leagues will square off with a championship on the line. Should Verlander or Gerrit Cole, or Washington\u2019s Strasburg, Scherzer or Patrick Corbin get peppered in a particular outing, the questions will come back.\n\nWere they tipping their pitches? How did the other team know? And was any verboten technology utilized to pass along information?\n\nBoth teams hope to avoid that fate. The Astros will have the added motivation to win a title sans the appearance of digital impropriety.\n\n\u201cThere's nothing going on,\u201d manager A.J. Hinch insisted during the ALCS, \u201cother than the competition on the field.\u201d\n\nGame on.", "description": "Pitch-tipping has become a hot topic in the postseason this year and with the Astros reaching the World Series, suspicions will linger.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published P.M.
