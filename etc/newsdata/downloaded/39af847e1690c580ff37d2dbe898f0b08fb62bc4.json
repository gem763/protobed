To me that seemed petty, very un-presidential.\n\nThen Trump blamed Obama for problems with the White House air conditioning.\n\nAt that point I thought we might as well be watching a comedy skit on \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nThat\u2019s why I always skip over headlines about Trump\u2019s obsession with Obama. My gut tells me I\u2019ll laugh but the story will be mostly empty political calories, a weak mix of gossip and amateur psychoanalysis.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEven when Trump went overseas and told a foreign audience that Obama was \u201coutsmarted\u201d and embarrassed by Russian President Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinCNN reports US pulled spy from Russia amid concerns about Trump's handling of intel Donald Trump is a 'sometimes socialist' Juan Williams: Trump's dangerous insecurity about Obama MORE, I thought that was so ridiculous, an outright distortion of the truth, that no one could take it seriously. He made that claim on the false premise that Crimea was \u201ctaken away from President Obama.\u201d\n\nThen I heard that lie justified by Trump boosters on talk radio with claims about Obama\u2019s reluctance to get into military confrontations.\n\nThis led me to ask \u2018How does Trump get away with these lies?\u2019 Do Trump\u2019s critics on the left \u2013 people labeled by Trump supporters as victims of Trump Derangement Syndrome - accept lies about Trump as fact?\n\nThe short answer is \u2018No.\u2019\n\nIn fact, Trump critics do the reverse to belittle Trump. They ask Trump supporters to imagine their hysteria if it was true that Obama made a pay-off to silence a porn star; took money from the military without congressional approval to build a wall because he couldn't get Mexico to pay for it; and ballooned the deficit to the point that it is estimated to reach a trillion dollars.\n\nWhat if Obama dismissed complaints that his attorney general paid $30,000 to host a holiday party at a property he owned?\n\nWe learned last week that Trump\u2019s attorney general, Bill Barr, did exactly that when he booked the Trump Hotel in Washington for his own lavish holiday party.\n\nWhat would Republicans say if Obama pitched holding the next G-7 summit at a property he owned?\n\nTrump did exactly that last month by suggesting that the U.S. should host next year\u2019s G-7 at his financially-distressed Doral Club in Miami, Florida.\n\nWhat would Republicans say if Obama or his aides used a black magic marker to doctor a chart produced by the National Weather Service showing the path of a hurricane bound for America?\n\nThat is exactly what happened last week, apparently to cover up Trump\u2019s misstatements that Alabama was in the path of Hurricane Dorian.\n\nYou get the point.\n\nThese disparate approaches to political attacks from the left and right came to my attention a few weeks ago when a swing-state Democratic congressman jokingly asked me why I think Trump tells so many lies about Obama.\n\nI said fact-checkers have Trump telling a lot of lies about a lot of people and laughed. But then I asked: Like what lies?\n\nThe congressman reminded me that Trump said Obama used wiretaps to spy on his 2016 campaign with no evidence.\n\nAnd Trump lied again by saying Obama was about to start a war with North Korea at the end of his second term and was turned down for a meeting with North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong Un Kim Jong UnNorth Korea says it's open to restarting nuclear negotiations with US in late September Donald Trump is a 'sometimes socialist' Juan Williams: Trump's dangerous insecurity about Obama MORE.\n\nNot only is there no evidence for those claims, the congressman said, but they have been called outright lies, on the record, by top intelligence, State Department and White House officials who were involved.\n\n\u201cAt the risk of stating the obvious, this is horsesh*t,\u201d tweeted Susan Rice, Obama\u2019s national security adviser.\n\nTo my surprise the congressman kept going with Trump lies about Obama.\n\nTrump lied, he said, when he claimed Obama made it a policy to separate children from their parents at the border. The truth is that Obama acted in select cases to protect children from being trafficked when, in the words of The New York Times, there was \u201cdoubt about the relationship between a child and an accompanying adult.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Trump\u2019s zero tolerance immigration policy resulted in close to 3,000 children being separated from their parents in an attempt to discourage people from seeking legal asylum.\n\nYet, when Trump\u2019s political supporters hear him trashing Obama they pay less attention to whether the claims are based on a lie than to the pleasure they get from him mocking an opponent.\n\nSo, for example, listening to falsehoods about Obama has the power to diminish the truth that Trump inherited from his predecessor a strong economy with falling unemployment, a booming stock-market, and steady GDP growth.\n\nTrump\u2019s distorted history of the Obama administration can also close your eyes when he wrongly claims to be fixing bad Obama policies.\n\nTrump falsely claimed he pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) because Obama made a bad deal for the U.S.\n\nBut the truth is it was a good deal for American workers and businesses that kept China from setting the rules of trade in Asia.\n\nPointing out lies is very different than telling lies and accepting a double standard for your politician\u2019s bad behavior.\n\nOn matters big and small, this president\u2019s lies, hypocrisy, and his manic obsession with his predecessor are destroying the fabric of the country he leads.\n\nIt is time for all sides to pay attention to the power of Trump\u2019s lies.", "description": "OPINION: It is time for all sides to pay attention to the power of Trump\u2019s lies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/obamabarack_trumpdonald_091118gn6_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
