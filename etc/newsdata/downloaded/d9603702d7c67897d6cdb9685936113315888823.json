(Really. One is on a barge.)", "language": "en", "text": "The first time I went to London, I asked a friend who lived there for bookstore recommendations. \u201cWell,\u201d he said with a pause, \u201cthat depends. What kind?\u201d I was too embarrassed to admit I didn\u2019t realize I had to specify. But given that I was in the center of the English-speaking literary world, it was an entirely reasonable question.\n\nThat sense of overload returned immediately on a recent trip back to the city, but this time I was better prepared for the depth and breadth of London\u2019s literary marketplace. Looking for a first edition of \u201cBrideshead Revisited\u201d? No problem. How about a medieval map? You can find that, too. Want to pick up a stack of recent paperbacks \u2014 from inside a boat? Step right this way (and mind your head).\n\nNo matter your interests, or your budget, London has a bookshop for you.\n\n\n\nThe interior of Daunt Books Marylebone. (Carly Adlington/Daunt Books)\n\nDaunt Books\n\nLocated a short walk from the Baker Street tube station, the original branch of this travel-focused chain greets you with an impeccably chosen selection of new fiction and nonfiction (including the most recent offerings from its publishing arm, Daunt Books Publishing). But the real allure is at the back. That\u2019s where the store opens up into three full stories of books, organized not by genre, but by country \u2014 meaning Javier Mar\u00edas\u2019s novels sit unusually but comfortably alongside \u201cLonely Planet Spain.\u201d With wooden banisters, skylights and all-around Edwardian charm, it\u2019s also one of the most photogenic bookshops in the city.\n\n83 Marylebone High St.\n\n011-44-020-7224-2295\n\ndauntbooks.co.uk\n\nAny Amount of Books\n\nIf I had to name a used bookstore that would appeal to anyone, the first place that comes to mind is Any Amount of Books. This shop is one of the few remaining on the booksellers\u2019 row immortalized in Helene Hanff\u2019s 1970 novel \u201c84, Charing Cross Road\u201d (that address is now a McDonald\u2019s), and it\u2019s a winning jumble of genres, formats and price points. Big-game hunters can browse the store\u2019s antiquarian titles, while those looking for quantity will be drawn to the eclectic and constantly updated sales rack out front. Most shoppers, however, will be happy to browse the walls of general-interest titles inside \u2014 but if you have something else to do that day, you might want to set a timer, lest you accidentally spend all day there.\n\n56 Charing Cross Rd.\n\n011-44-020-7836-3697\n\nanyamountofbooks.com\n\n\n\nFoyles, on book-famous Charing Cross Road in Central London. (Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)\n\nFoyles\n\nThis London institution, once infamous for its maddeningly archaic business practices (titles were barely organized and there were no cash registers), has in recent years reinvented itself as a thoroughly modern bookselling chain. Nowhere is that newfound sleekness more on display than the five-story flagship shop on Charing Cross Road. It\u2019s thoroughly stocked, clearly and intuitively organized, and even has a dedicated cafe on the top floor, which is perhaps why the new incarnation also feels a bit lacking in personality. More adventurous book lovers will want to get their kicks elsewhere, but if you need to grab a self-help book with an expletive in the title, or a \u201cGood Grammar Is Sexy\u201d tote bag, then Foyles is undoubtedly the place to go.\n\n107 Charing Cross Rd.\n\n011-44-020-7437-5660\n\nfoyles.co.uk/bookstore-charing-cross\n\n\n\nPeter Ellis sits at his book-stacked desk inside his antiquarian bookshop off Charing Cross Road. (Peter Ellis Bookseller)\n\nPeter Ellis, Bookseller\n\nDid you know that in the Harry Potterverse, the magical Diagon Alley is accessed via an abandoned-looking pub just off Charing Cross Road? The booksellers of the real-life Cecil Court do, if only because the alleyway in front of their shops is frequently clogged with tour groups learning that fact via megaphone. Once you weave your way through, however, an excellent assortment of cozy, higher-end bookshops awaits \u2014 including Peter Ellis, an old-school antiquarian bookseller who specializes in modern first editions. If your favorite book was published in the 20th century, here\u2019s the place to treat yourself to that pristine copy you\u2019ve always dreamed of.\n\n18 Cecil Court\n\n011-44-020-7836-8880\n\npeterellisbooks.com\n\n\n\nTables and bookcases at Gosh! Comics in Soho are piled with all types of titles. (Mauricio Molizane de Souza/Gosh! Comics)\n\nGosh! Comics\n\nIt\u2019s fitting that there\u2019s a Bat-Signal in front of Gosh!, as comics fans from all over the city will find themselves drawn to a graphic-novel selection that shows off just about everything the medium has to offer. The shop\u2019s aesthetic is spare and understated, but the stock is not: Each table and bookcase is piled with titles of all sizes, formats and colors. You\u2019ll find traditional superhero fare here (including \u201ckey creator\u201d sections for luminaries such as Alan Moore and Neil Gaiman), but also a large selection of children\u2019s comics, an entire wall of indie and small-press titles, and a general fiction section \u2014 the latter yet another compelling argument that the genre has long since transcended the funny pages.\n\n1 Berwick St.\n\n011-44-020-7437-0187\n\ngoshlondon.com\n\nPersephone Books\n\nThis shop does double duty not only as a charming retail outlet, but also as the office space for the publisher of the same name, which has been bringing neglected titles from mostly mid-century female authors back into print since 1999. At this point, Persephone\u2019s backlist runs to more than 130 titles, each of which is available at the store on Lamb\u2019s Conduit Street \u2014 and each arranged, to my delight, in numerical order. Staff members work both sides of the business, and their inside knowledge of the stock means they are unusually skilled at handselling. I asked whether they had any good novels about London and was being rung up for a copy of Norah Hoult\u2019s \u201cThere Were No Windows,\u201d from 1944, in a matter of seconds.\n\n59 Lamb\u2019s Conduit St.\n\n011-44-020-7242-9292\n\npersephonebooks.co.uk\n\n\n\nGay's the Word is in another book-rich neighborhood \u2014 Bloomsbury. (Gay\u2019s the Word)\n\nGay's the Word\n\nWhile North Americans are often familiar with Charing Cross Road\u2019s literary reputation, the nearby districts of Bloomsbury and Saint Pancras are home to their own excellent cluster of bookshops. Start your visit here, at Britain\u2019s oldest LGBT+ bookstore, which has been around since 1979. Gay\u2019s the Word has enough stock that you might mistake it for a general-interest shop, and it has a particularly strong selection of queer history and politics. (Though its fiction is nothing to sniff at, either: Author Sarah Waters has called Gay\u2019s the Word \u201cBritain\u2019s best outlet for lesbian, gay and trans-interest books.\u201d) The shop has also long been a hub for London\u2019s larger LGBT+ community, with a busy bulletin board, a range of in-store events and discussions, and even a mini-exhibit of queer pins from Paud Hegarty, a former store manager and gay activist who died in 2000.\n\n66 Marchmont St.\n\n011-44-020-7278-7654\n\ngaystheword.co.uk\n\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t get the name at first, the storefront window offers hints. (Skoob Books)\n\nSkoob Books\n\nJust around the corner from Gay\u2019s the Word is the staircase down to Skoob Books (get it?), an underground treasure trove of more than 50,000 secondhand titles at hard-to-beat prices. At Skoob, the element of surprise is key, which is why the store is full of nooks and crannies to scour and get lost browsing in. The store boasts a wide range of nonfiction, including philosophy, history, politics and science, and its fiction selection includes the siren\u2019s call that is entire bookcases of orange and black Penguin Classics. The low-hanging pipes and heating ducts only heighten the feeling that you\u2019re about to unearth something special.\n\n66 the Brunswick (off Marchmont Street)\n\n011-44-020-7278-8760\n\nskoob.com\n\n\n\nRegent's Canal in Kings Cross is an unusual site for a bookstore. (Harry Mitchell for The Washington Post)\n\nWord on the Water\n\nIt might sound like a gimmick \u2014 and the ambiance of Regent\u2019s Canal certainly doesn\u2019t hurt \u2014 but this floating, century-old Dutch barge is a legitimate secondhand bookshop. Its stock ranges from classics to photography to contemporary fiction, and the farther inside you venture, the snugger it gets; when you reach the children\u2019s section on the lowest level, you\u2019ll find the L-shaped couch that attracts patrons and the bookshop dog alike. In warmer weather, the shop hosts live music on its rooftop stage. When it gets chilly, there\u2019s a wood-burning stove to help keep you warm as you browse.\n\nRegent\u2019s Canal at York Way\n\n011-44-079-7688-6982\n\nfacebook.com/wordonthewater\n\nHingston is a writer based in Edmonton, Alberta.
