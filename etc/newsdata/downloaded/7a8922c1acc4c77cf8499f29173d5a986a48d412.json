The technology has military and space applications, prosecutors said.\n\nAnalysts say the increase in prosecutions is the result of the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to limit economic damage wrought by China\u2019s rampant theft of intellectual property, which costs American companies $225 billion to $600 billion a year, according to U.S. trade officials.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a recognition of exactly how much the country\u2019s economic security is at risk. There are only so many times a business can lose $3 million or $4 million before the government is going to act,\u201d said Nicholas Eftimiades, whose 34-year government career includes stints at the CIA and Defense and State departments.\n\nEconomic espionage is at the heart of Mr. Trump\u2019s aggressive use of tariffs to force China to change its ways, though Beijing insists it doesn\u2019t steal trade secrets.\n\nHowever, the surge in prosecutions is largely the result of the Justice Department\u2019s improved effectiveness in marshaling its efforts to tackle these cases, analysts say.\n\n\u201cI think we are seeing the Justice Department dedicate more resources to the effort and more cohesion to develop more cases,\u201d said Ryan Fayhee, who spent 11 years prosecuting trade secret and espionage cases for the Justice Department before entering private practice.\n\nThat consolidation is a direct result of the China Initiative launched in November by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Mr. Fayhee said.\n\nUnder the initiative, the Justice Department vowed to aggressively pursue Chinese trade secret theft cases and ensure enough resources are dedicated to prosecuting them quickly and efficiently.\n\nSince the initiative\u2019s launch, several high-profile cases involving Chinese espionage have made headlines.\n\nA former General Electric employee was charged in April with stealing trade secrets to benefit two Chinese competitors in a scheme bankrolled by the Chinese government, prosecutors said.\n\nThe Justice Department in August accused a University of Kansas researcher of hiding his ties to a Chinese university while collecting tens of thousands of dollars in research grants from U.S. taxpayers.\n\nIn perhaps its largest action, the Justice Department hit the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei with a slew of charges, including stealing trade secrets from T-Mobile.\n\nThe FBI earlier this year added Xudong Yao, a 57-year-old software engineer, to its wanted list. U.S. authorities say he fled to China with the propriety source code for a locomotive control system developed by a suburban Chicago company.\n\nMr. Eftimiades said the caseload increased because the Justice Department is trying to catch up while China expands its espionage efforts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been involved in an 18-year war against terrorism while China was quietly and aggressively moving forward,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t become a priority until China started exercising its military power at the expense of the United States, putting us at a strategic disadvantage.\u201d\n\nThe China initiative has yielded mixed results, analysts say. Mr. Eftimiades said it has protected companies but has not stopped China from stealing U.S. technology.\n\n\u201cYou can point to X number dollars that have been saved or individuals arrested, but it hasn\u2019t deterred China at all,\u201d he said.\n\nInstead, he said, U.S. officials must partner with businesses if they want to successfully combat this threat.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s whole society approach necessitates a whole government response,\u201d he said. \u201cOur government needs to get out of the mindset of trying to do everything by itself. The industry is the target, and they have a place in protecting U.S. security.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
