The German side won 2-1.\n\nYoussoufa Moukoko is playing for Borussia Dortmund's Under-19 team at the age of 14\n\nFor once his name didn't appear on the scoresheet but his appearance naturally caught the eye of Spanish giants Real Madrid, who are keeping tabs as the academy star seeks to follow the pathway to the first-team taken by the likes of Mario Gotze, Marco Reus and Nuri Sahin.\n\n'My goal is to become a professional with Dortmund, win the Champions League with Borussia and win the Ballon d'Or,' the striker told SportBild.\n\nSahin remains both Dortmund's and the Bundesliga's youngest-ever player at the age of 16 years, 11 months and one day.\n\nThe 14-year-old striker has scored 15 goals in seven games for the U19 side this season\n\nFACTFILE DOB: November 20, 2004 POB: Cameroon Club career St Pauli (2014 - 16) Borussia Dortmund (2016 - ) 2016-17 Age 11 U15 33 goals/21 games 2017/18 Age 12 U17 44 goals/33 games 2018/19 Age 13 U17 46 goals/25 games 2019/20 Age 14 U19 15 goals/7 games International career Germany U16\n\nMoukoko has until the start of the 2021/22 season to break into the first-team and break that record by a couple of months.\n\nYouth chief Lars Ricken Ricken has naturally attempted to play down the hype surrounding the teenager.\n\n'We are staying calm for now and don't forget that when we judge his performances,' Ricken said. 'Just because he's scored a lot of goals at youth level does not guarantee he will become a professional.'\n\nBut if he continues his phenomenal goal record is appears only a matter of time.\n\nMoukoko, who joined Dortmund from Bundesliga 2 side St Pauli, first caught the eye as a 12-year-old by scoring twice for the U17s against local rivals Schalke as BVB recovered from a three-goal deficit to draw 4-4.\n\nMoukoko is seeking to follow in the footsteps of Dortmund favourites Mario Gotze, Marco Reus\n\n46 goals in 25 games \u26bd\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\n\n\n\n... and he\u2019s only 14! pic.twitter.com/45JWdZ2Qvk \u2014 Borussia Dortmund (@BlackYellow) June 2, 2019\n\nThe Cameroon-born prospect went on to score 40 goals that season as he helped Dortmund top their regional division and then lift the national title by netting decisive goals in the semi-final against Leverkusen and final against Bayern Munich.\n\nIn 2018/19 he helped Dortmund seal top spot in Bundesliga West with a game to spare and to reach the final once again. He bagged six braces, six hat-tricks and netted four on three occasions.\n\nHe scored two and also provided an assist as BVB beat their Wolfsburg counterparts 4-1 in the first leg of the semi-final. He netted once more in the return leg and in the B-Junioren Bundesliga final against Cologne.\n\nAlthough Borussia fell short of defending their crown, the youngster's goal in the decider brought up his half century of goals for the campaign.\n\nThe prodigious forward has continued in the same vein this season and netted another hat-trick in a 6-2 hammering of Arminia Bielefeld.\n\nA goal in the 2-0 success at Viktoria Koln took Moukoko\u2019s tally to 10 for the season, and a brace at RW Oberhausen in matchday six took his tally to 15 goals in seven league matches this season.\n\nIt also meant Moukoko has now scored a staggering 105 goals in 65 games after stepping up from the U15 team as he seeks to follow in the footsteps of Dortmund favourites Gotze and Reus.", "description": "The 14-year-old has scored a staggering 105 goals in 65 games for the U17 and U19 teams as he seeks to follow in the footsteps of Dortmund favourites Gotze and Reus.", "authors": ["David Wood For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/17/19550292-0-image-a-4_1570726219116.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
