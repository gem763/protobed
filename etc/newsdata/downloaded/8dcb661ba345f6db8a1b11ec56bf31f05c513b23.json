Photo: Getty Images\n\nOn day three of Milan Fashion Week, while waiting for the Sportmax show to start, an editor leaned over and told me she\u2019d packed 14 pairs of shoes and nothing to wear them with. It sounds excessive, but I could sympathize. No, I didn\u2019t pack 14 pairs of shoes. (I proudly narrowed it down to six and have worn only two thus far.) But when I get dressed in the morning, I often find myself taking a shoe-first approach \u2014 as I think a lot of people do in this sneaker-obsessed age.\n\nAccessories have always been key to the success of a brand \u2014 especially for the Italians, who are known for their leather goods \u2014 but today they seem to play a leading role, oftentimes overshadowing the clothes on the runway. This was the case on Thursday, particularly at shows like Max Mara, Fendi, and Bottega Veneta.\n\nMax Mara spring 2020.

They all wore militant gray uniforms with neckties, their hair braided into pigtails. So I guess I need a tie, I thought to myself as they stomped past. The collection was inspired by both Killing Eve and the upcoming James Bond movie \u2014 the script for which Phoebe Waller-Bridge also consulted on. It supposedly \u201ctreats women fairly\u201d this time around, and Max Mara took the liberty of imagining a spy wardrobe for its a strong female leads. I was a little disappointed that the designer seems to have taken the male Bond uniform and fitted it to a woman\u2019s body, but I really do want a tie, so I\u2019ll take it.\n\nFendi spring 2020.

The message was loud and clear: It\u2019s a new dawn for the brand, and the sun is shining. The collection had softness and warmth \u2014 a personal touch. It wasn\u2019t trying to be too fashionable, or luxurious to the point of impractical. With looks inspired by the \u201960s slapstick film Carry on Camping, the models wore bright floral prints and large tinted glasses reminiscent of the grooviest decade. They weren\u2019t hippies, or \u201cfreaks\u201d as the Italians called them, but their hair was messy and they gave off the energy of hitchhikers on the way to Woodstock, with hats to keep the sun off their heads and tiny bags worn around their necks.\n\nBottega Veneta spring 2020.

You may have seen the Bottega campaign that\u2019s plastered everywhere \u2014 the one with a model wearing nothing but, you guessed it, a chunky chain necklace. It announced Lee\u2019s arrival at the brand in January, and I was sold. You\u2019ve also probably seen a bunch of influencers wearing his accessories lately \u2014 the fishnet heels, thick combat boots, and quilted bags, for example. Some seem to have been gifted, but retailers claim they\u2019re flying off the shelves as well. This is good news for Lee: It presumably puts him on solid financial ground and allows him to experiment with clothing in the meantime. Like his accessories, the collection (his second) played with hard and soft \u2014 although it leaned toward the latter this season, meaning it seemed more wearable. The balance still felt a bit off for me; I didn\u2019t find pieces like a drop-crotch leather boilersuit with shorts, for example, as flattering or seductive as, say, a buttery-leather clutch. But judging by the feet of everyone in the front row, a significant part of the equation is working.\n\nMoschino spring 2020.

Jeremy Scott seemed to reproduce Picasso\u2019s entire oeuvre for the runway, from Girl With a Mandolin to Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon. Wearing a giant gilded frame might not be practical, but what else is an accessory, really, anyway?", "description": "Accessories have always been key to the success of a brand \u2014 and especially to the Italians, who are known for their leather goods.
