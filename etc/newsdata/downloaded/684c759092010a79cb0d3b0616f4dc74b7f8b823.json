Antifa Blocks Elderly Couple From Crossing the Street", "language": "en", "text": "Antifa in Canada came out in force to protest an event being put on by People\u2019s Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier and political commentator Dave Rubin. In a video posted on Twitter, members of Antifa can be seen blocking the path of an elderly couple and heckling them.\n\nThe couple was attempting to cross the street, when the masked protesters stood in front of them, shouting, \"Nazi scum! Off our streets! Nazi scum! Off our streets!\"\n\nWhen the man got closer to Antifa, one of them can be heard shouting, \"Don't f--king touch me!\"\n\nThey really start by cleaning their room.\n\n\n\nLooking forward to a spirited chat, @MaximeBernier... pic.twitter.com/JzVBUKMhtC \u2014 Dave Rubin (@RubinReport) September 29, 2019\n\n\"These Antifa protesters are a small minority of violent thugs. The most frightening is that their extremist, Far Left ideology is now tacitly supported by many in academia, the media, activist organizations, and politics. Our democracy is in danger,\" Bernier tweeted in response to the video.\n\nOther interactions between Antifa and supporters of Bernier resulted in altercations. In a statement, Canadian police said around 100 counter-protesters showed up, with four people arrested for breaching \"of the peace.\" Those who were arrested were later released unconditionally.\n\nThey added no injuries were reported.\n\nCBC reported the event by Bernier and Rubin was centered around preserving \"freedom\" from censorship in the country, their doubts about climate change science, keeping government small, and Bernier's plan to repeal the Multiculturalism Act.", "description": ".09/30/2019 20:06:25PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Beth Baumann", "Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/273/18e153e6-a5d7-4c09-9eeb-fb59bf951922.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
