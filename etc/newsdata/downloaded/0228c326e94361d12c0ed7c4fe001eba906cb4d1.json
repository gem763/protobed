Canadian households have a 174.1% debt-to-income ratio in 2019 Q2. Rating agencies have already downgraded some of the banks as the risk of higher defaults rises as consumers take on more credit that they can pay back, even at record low interest rates.\n\nUSD/CAD for Sept. 13 2019.\n\nGold\n\nGold is struggling to recapture last week\u2019s high on trade optimism and aftermarkets were disappointed with the European Central Bank\u2019s cut to its deposit rate and launching of a smaller than expected new bond buying program.
