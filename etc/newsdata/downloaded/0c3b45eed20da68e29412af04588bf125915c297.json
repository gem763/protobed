Although it is fully curable, patients often go untreated simply because of poor access to medical facilities.\n\nBut in some of the most remote parts of Nepal, an eye care revolution is under way.\n\nOphthalmologist Sunduk Ruit has developed a simple, stitch-free surgical technique and produces lenses for cataract patients - all of which allows doctors to perform fast, low-cost surgeries.\n\nWe develop a system here keeping in mind that we face these obstacles. So such a system of eye care can very easily be replicable in other countries with very similar challenges. Dr Sunduk Ruit, Nepalese ophthalmologist\n\nKnown locally as the \"God of Sight\", the Nepalese doctor packs up his clinic and travels the country to service remote communities and the country's poor, providing his services free of charge.\n\nRuit is so effective in his technique, that doctors from around the world come to Nepal to train with him.\n\nAl Jazeera first met him in 2014 as he travelled among Nepal's mountains, set up \"eye camps\", and held traineeships for fellow doctors.\n\nFive years on, Rewind returned to his centre in Kathmandu to see what has changed.\n\nRuit's hospital, which also manufactures lenses, has nearly doubled its production in the past five years to about 500,000 lenses a year. His hospital has also been recognised by the World Health Organization.\n\nRuit also runs a community eye hospital south of Kathmandu in Makwanpur district. There, a team of doctors screens more than 300 patients a day and performs nearly 5,000 surgeries a year, most of them cataract surgeries.\n\nRuit says it is a model that can transfer to other developing countries.\n\n\"We develop a system here keeping in mind that we face these obstacles,\" he says.\n\n\"So such a system of eye care can very easily be replicable in other countries with very similar challenges.\"\n\nSource: Al Jazeera", "description": "World-recognised eye doctor pioneers technique to treat curable blindness, returning sight to country's poor.", "authors": ["Dr Sunduk Ruit"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/10/5df2f1b6e001453fac76663191d0020b_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
