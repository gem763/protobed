We want to be the driving force that paves a new way to travel, helping everyone explore our world in a way that protects both people and places, and secures a positive future for destinations and local communities for generations to come.\u201d\n\nThis is the bold mission statement of Travalyst, the initiative set up last month by the Duke of Sussex in partnership with some of the biggest names in the travel industry \u2013 Booking.com, Ctrip, Skyscanner, TripAdvisor and Visa \u2013 with \u201cthe ambition to change the impact of travel, for good\".\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt\u2019s a laudable goal. Who wouldn\u2019t want the impact of travel to be changed \u201cfor good\u201d? It\u2019s often the elephant in the room in our profession: that travel, in all its glorious possibility, poses some ethical dilemmas, both in terms of people and planet. There are myriad issues to be addressed, from the carbon emissions produced by flying to the dubious morality of slum tourism (where wealthy Westerners have a nose about a community living in poverty). A more sustainable industry would serve to benefit tourists and locals alike.\n\nThe thing is \u2013 and it is quite a big thing, one might argue \u2013 a month after launching, Travalyst isn\u2019t saying how it\u2019s actually going to achieve any of the lofty aims set out on its slick yet sparsely populated website. And that is extremely problematic. For one, it raises uncomfortable questions about the timing of the project\u2019s launch, which just so happened to follow a slew of media coverage slamming the Duke and Duchess\u2019s decision to take four private jet flights in under a fortnight.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Getty Images\n\nBefore you think I\u2019m just sticking the oar in for the sake of it, let me state for the record that I actually rather like Prince Harry and have nothing but warm feelings towards Meghan. I genuinely believe they are committed to issues of sustainability and equality and want to use their considerable influence as a force for good in the world. More power to \u2019em.\n\nThe trouble is, as a journalist, you learn to read between the lines of PR fluff \u2013 to skim past all the bombastic pronouncements and get to the meat and bones of a story. You\u2019re after the tangible, concrete details: the who, what, when, where, why, how. Aside from the who and the why, all the rest remains up for grabs. How are Prince Harry and several multi-million pound companies going to change travel \u201cfor good\u201d? What is it they\u2019re going to do, exactly? When and, in fact, where are these projects going to materialise?\n\nOn the day of the big reveal press conference in Amsterdam (attended by the Duke, who opted to travel by plane rather than train), I read all 1,100 words of the press release. I read them again. I read them a third time. And I was still none the wiser. It\u2019s not easy to write a well-crafted press release of impressive length without really saying much, but somehow they managed it.\n\n\u201cThis bold new partnership is paving a new way to travel; driving change to help everyone explore the world in a more sustainable manner, protecting people, places, and wildlife, and securing a positive future for destinations and local communities for many generations to come,\u201d it stated.\n\n\u201cThe partnership will initially explore and promote solutions that help drive sustainable practices and consumer choices in areas including; supporting local people, protecting wildlife, tackling climate change and environmental damage, and alleviating overtourism.\u201d\n\nSo many words, so little information. But the most telling part read: \u201cFurther details of new initiatives launched by the Travalyst partnership will be announced in due course.\u201d\n\nTo me, this translates as: \u201cWe haven\u2019t actually got any initiatives yet.\u201d Prince Harry\u2019s name, coupled with the increasingly popular buzzwords of \u201csustainable tourism\u201d, \u201cconservation\u201d, \u201cclimate change\u201d and \u201covertourism\u201d, ensured Travalyst got maximum exposure across print and broadcast media \u2013 all without having to state a single concrete detail. Impressive.\n\nWhen approached to give details of how this bold new collaboration was going to change the world, TripAdvisor said they were \u201cafraid we don\u2019t have anything to share with you at this time,\u201d while Visa \u201cdon\u2019t have anything further to announce on this currently but will let you know once we do\".\n\nBooking.com has more to say, but it\u2019s still terribly woolly. Areas of focus include \u201cboosting the visibility of sustainable travel options for consumers and exploring innovative ways for social entrepreneurs and local communities to join forces to help tackle specific challenges on a destination level\". Again, great in theory \u2013 but in practice more questions than answers are raised. What constitutes a more \u201csustainable option\u201d? What are the criteria? Would the algorithm prioritise sustainability above and beyond better-rated listings? As for the latter area mentioned, the specifics are so sparse it\u2019s barely worth mentioning.\n\n\u201cAmong initial activities, we will explore solutions that drive adoption of sustainable practices, while considering how best to enable consumers to make sustainable travel choices. This will include exploring technologies and innovations that can change the way we travel.\u201d This from Skyscanner \u2013 again, words like \u201cexplore\u201d and \u201cconsider\u201d paper over a dearth of detail. In fairness, the flight comparison website recently announced it was investing in SkyNRG, the global market leader for sustainable aviation fuels, to help develop of a new production facility \u2013 though this commitment doesn\u2019t appear to be materially linked with Travalyst.\n\nCtrip is yet to comment on its practical involvement.\n\nA spokesperson for Sussex Royal, the foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, said that, though there are no project details that can be revealed right now, more announcements will be made \u201cwithin the next 12 months\u201d.\n\nThey added: \u201cThere are key streams each of the partners are focusing on and working on. We\u2019ll be doing pilot projects and research that will help inform very specific initiatives, timed out over the next three years.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why Travalyst was launched when there was little to tell, they said: \u201cUniting all these organisations that don\u2019t normally come together is significant. We saw the Amsterdam event as a partnership announcement \u2013 it was the start of something.\n\n\u201cWe also want to mobilise and talk to other companies within the travel sector. Once you make a public declaration, it allows you to get out there and have conversations with people and organisations in the industry.\n\n\u201cIt was very much the start of a process and we\u2019re looking forward to building on it going forward.\u201d\n\nPerhaps they're right. I hate to be cynical. The Duke and Duchess have enough clout that, in time, I expect the whole exercise will come good and support will be given to various worthy programmes around the globe, with a large degree of success. But to launch an \u201cinitiative\u201d, \u201cproject\u201d, \u201cscheme\u201d \u2013 whatever you want to call it \u2013 before you have any real, material plans to share? It feels an awful lot like greenwashing dressed up as do-gooding.\n\nOnly time will tell if Travalyst is all climate talk and no climate action.", "description": "\u201cWe believe in the power and importance of travel and that we also have a shared responsibility to our planet and to each other.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re coming together as a catalyst for change.
