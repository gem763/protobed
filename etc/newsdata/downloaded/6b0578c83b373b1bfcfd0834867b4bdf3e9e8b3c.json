You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe UK government has urged Mr Trump to withdraw the diplomatic immunity in order to allow police to question Ms Sacoolas, with Boris Johnson raising the case during a call with the US president.\n\nBut speaking on Wednesday, the Republican appeared to defend her, saying that driving on the wrong side of the road \"can happen\".\n\nHe said: \"The woman was driving on the wrong side of the road, and that can happen. You know, those are the opposite roads, that happens.\"\n\nThe comments were described as \"insensitive, clumsy, oafish and insulting\" by a spokesperson for the Dunn family and also condemned by Mr Corbyn during a visit to Northamptonshire on Thursday.\n\nAnswering questions after a speech in Northampton, the Labour leader said the US decision to grant Ms Sacoolas diplomatic immunity had been \"completely unacceptable\" and claimed Labour would look at taking legal action if it was possible to do so.\n\nHe said: \u201cI'm alarmed about that.\n\n\u201cFor somebody to be killed in our country and the person who did it to flee to the United States and then claim diplomatic immunity is completely unacceptable.\"\n\nHe added: \u201cI know the family went to see Dominic Raab yesterday. We would put every bit of possible pressure we could on the United states.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

To end war you have to make peace, which is what all sides should do now.\n\n\"The Syrian peace process must mean peace and security for the Kurdish people too, whose voice must be included and heard. Reckless military interventions have made Britain and the world a more dangerous place.\"\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
