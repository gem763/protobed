His son Luke is identified on his LinkedIn page as a \u201cdigital strategy consultant\u201d at IBM, which was an original bidder for the JEDI contract.\n\nIBM IBM, +1.04% was dropped from the competition, along with Oracle ORCL, -1.85% , and both companies have complained that the contracting process is rigged in favor of Amazon Web Services Inc., a division of Amazon AMZN, -1.12% .\n\nAmazon and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -1.49% are finalists for the contract.\n\nA U.S. Federal Claims Court judge last summer ruled in favor of the Pentagon\u2019s assertion that the contracting process has been fair. In August, the Pentagon\u2019s independent auditor disclosed that it was conducting a broad review of the handling of the project. The probe includes an investigation of potential misconduct by current or former Defense Department officials involved in the project.\n\nHoffman said Esper was not legally required to recuse himself, but did so after receiving what Hoffman called informational briefings on the JEDI contract.\n\nEsper delegated decision-making responsibility on the JEDI program to Deputy Defense Secretary David Norquist, Hoffman said.", "description": "Defense Secretary Mark Esper has removed himself from decision-making on a cloud computing contract potentially worth $10 billion, citing his son\u2019s...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HL963_esper0_ZG_20190622141639.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
