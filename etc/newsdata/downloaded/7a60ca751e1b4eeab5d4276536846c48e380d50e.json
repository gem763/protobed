He is for sure one of the most qualified to do that. That\u2019s what we\u2019re discussing.\u201d\n\nAny deal would likely also include an unspecified number of outings in first free practice at race weekends.\n\n\u201cSimulator drivers all have in-car time as they need to correlate the sim (simulator) work with what the car is doing otherwise there\u2019s no point,\u201d said Steiner.\n\nHaas, currently ninth of the 10 teams, have confirmed their 2020 lineup of Frenchman Romain Grosjean and Danish driver Kevin Magnussen.\n\nKubica has scored Williams sole point of the season, although generally out-qualified and beaten by British rookie team mate George Russell in races.\n\nThe Pole made his race comeback this year after suffering a near-fatal rally crash in 2011 that partially severed his right forearm.\n\nHis sponsor, Polish oil refiner OKN Orlen, has said it intends to stay in Formula One with him. Haas no longer has a title sponsor after parting company last month with the Rich Energy drink brand.\n\n\u201cI hardly see myself just being closed in a dark room just doing laps in a simulator,\u201d Kubica told reporters when asked about a switch to Haas. \u201cI\u2019m not excluding it but it would have to be a combined programme, which is why it is taking time.\u201d", "description": "Haas are talking to Polish driver Robert Kubica about a test and simulator role, the U.S.-owned Formula One team said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Alan Baldwin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444673662&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N23M", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
