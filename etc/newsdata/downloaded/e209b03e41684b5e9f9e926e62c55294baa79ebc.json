Usama bin Laden organized it, Al Qaeda executed it -- but none of it would've been possible but for the safe harbor, protection and support bin Laden and Al Qaeda got from the Taliban in Afghanistan.\"\n\nTODD STARNES: 9/11 'NEVER FORGET' MEMORIALS FACE CENSORSHIP, VANDALISM\n\nLevin added that critics often express concern over American military forces fighting a war in a country \"thousands of miles away\" like Afghanistan.\n\n\"They struck us in the heart of our biggest city, they struck the Pentagon, they would've struck the White House or the Capitol building but for the civilian heroes that brought a third plane down in the middle of Pennsylvania,\" he said.\n\n\"That is why we're in Afghanistan.\"\n\nHe said there is also criticism of the fact the war in the Middle East has gone on for nearly two decades.\n\n\"We have 14,000 soldiers [in Afghanistan] and they have prevented another 9/11,\" the \"Life, Liberty & Levin\" host said.\n\n\"Al Qaeda still exists, so do the Taliban. But tonight, it is not my intention to attack or sabotage the president or the secretary of state or his administration. I have a different opinion than they do -- that's not unusual. And we the people -- you and I -- we get to be heard too.\"\n\nLevin stressed his discussion on the matter of the Taliban is intended to help President Trump and not hurt him and was again a difference of opinion.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe said his audience should, after watching montages of that terrible day in 2001, ask themselves, \"Should we have been in any peace negotiations with the Taliban? Should the Taliban ever have been invited to come and set foot on the continental United States?\"\n\n\"It's not that I don't trust the president,\" he continued. \"These are terrorists -- they're not to be trusted in the least.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the president canceled a planned meeting with Taliban officials at the Camp David presidential retreat near Frederick, Md.", "description": "The 18th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks is a reminder why America cannot negotiate with the Taliban, nor invite them stateside, according to Mark Levin.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Levin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
