Supporters viewed it as a basic first step to shape the tone of political discourse in the primary and guard against manipulation and online disinformation.\n\nBut party leaders did not bring the proposal to a vote at a meeting of the full DNC in San Francisco late last month, despite the pleas of the state chairs. Among the sprawling Democratic presidential field, only frontrunner Joe Biden has signed the pledge. The pact also calls on campaigns to publicly implore their supporters not to use disinformation and call them out if necessary.\n\n\u201cI haven't the faintest idea\u201d why it wasn\u2019t taken up, said Tina Podlodowski, chairwoman of Washington state\u2019s Democratic Party. \u201cI'm kind of banging my head against this wall that has three letters \u2014 DNC \u2014 on it.\u201d\n\nThe DNC did not say whether it plans to adopt or implement the proposal crafted by the state party chairs. It was passed unanimously by the Association of State Democratic Committees in June ahead of the DNC\u2019s August meeting.\n\n\u201cIn our communications, we discourage the use of inauthentic content and actors,\u201d said DNC spokesman Daniel Wessel, referring to informal correspondence with state parties and campaigns. \u201cThose are tactics used against Americans, not ones Americans should use against each other. While we know this is a tactic that is not being used by our Democratic candidates, including our Democratic presidential candidates, unfortunately the same cannot be said of the Republican ecosystem.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The DNC recently shut down \u201cvirtual\u201d caucuses in Iowa and Nevada \u2014 which would have allowed people to register their presidential preferences without spending hours at a caucus location \u2014 because of concerns they would be vulnerable to hacks. Multiple Democratic Party officials and cybersecurity experts said the decision should have been made months ago.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, the campaign manager for presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke announced that a fake Twitter account had successfully spread a lie that the alleged shooter in Odessa, Texas' recent mass killing had an O\u2019Rourke sticker on his car. The DNC helped O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign identify that it was the victim of a disinformation campaign being spread by the fraudulent right-wing account.\n\n\u201cWe are so unprepared for the massive misinformation that is happening, that has happened and that will happen,\u201d said Jane Kleeb, chairwoman of the Nebraska Democratic Party. \u201cWe need our [DNC] leadership, including state party chairs, to get into a room create a policy for our candidates, campaigns, state parties and then hire a team to implement those policies.\u201d\n\nThough Kleeb said she\u2019s not too worried about Democrats using fake social media posts or hiring troll farms, she said the official party needs to have a codified policy.\n\n\u201cUnless it\u2019s written [down],\u201d she said, \u201cwe can\u2019t cut a candidate off from the voter file if they\u2019re breaking that policy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Russians and other foreign state actors appear willing to use counterfeit measures to influence American elections. And the Republican Party has refused to officially disavow the deceptive campaign tactics, even after President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Guliani drew fire in May for retweeting a doctored video, known as a deep fake, making House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sound discombobulated.\n\n2020 Dems on the issues \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\nCybersecurity: Election Security Securing 5G\n\nTrump has long dismissed the cyber and disinformation threat, even attempting to sow doubt about Russian interference in 2016. The president retweeted a spliced-up video about Pelosi earlier this year and has repeatedly retweeted accounts that appeared to be fake. One of Trump\u2019s reelection consultants published fake websites disguised as official platforms for Democratic candidates. And Trump\u2019s campaign used stock footage of overseas models from places like France and Brazil claiming to be Americans from states like Texas in social ads.\n\nThe recent O\u2019Rourke episode is indicative of the Wild West online environment campaigns are confronting. And the lack of a clear guidelines or principles by big digital platforms and the party committees is glaring, critics say.\n\nOn Friday, O\u2019Rourke's campaign sent letters to Facebook, Google and Twitter pressing them to develop specific steps to stop the spread of misinformation. Additionally, Jen O\u2019Malley Dillion, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign manager urged Democratic presidential candidates to join them.\n\n\u201cThis week it\u2019s us, but every candidate is at risk of disinformation campaigns,\u201d O\u2019Malley Dillon tweeted. \u201cSo today, we are calling on everyone in this race to stand with us in demanding Facebook, Google, and Twitter do better.\u201d\n\nIn the absence of a coherent plan by tech giants, the party committees present a potential line of defense for candidates and their state party operations.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) is proposing a bill that would change campaign finance law to make it easier for national party committees to send more money to state parties, candidates and campaigns for cybersecurity tools.\n\nBut in the interim, Democratic state party chairs and some outside groups are clamoring for the national party to take a clear stand.\n\n\u201cThe DNC certainly has a responsibility, as well as the presidential candidates, to condemn these types of tactics to make sure that we are protecting people's data privacy,\u201d said Ken Martin, chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and president of the state Democratic committees.\n\nIn June, Biden was the first in the 2020 field to pledge not to take part in destructive tactics over social media, including banning the use of synthetic social media accounts and bot networks to attack opponents.\n\nIn a New York City speech in July, Biden called on his competitors to do the same.\n\n\u201cWe asked candidates across Europe and North America to sign a pledge, committing to transparency in campaign finances and to reject the use of fabricated or hacked materials,\u201d Biden said, referencing a Trans-Atlantic Commission on Election Integrity. \u201cNow that I am a candidate for office, I have signed that pledge, and I urge everyone running for president to do the same.\u201d\n\nThe DNC\u2019s position on the official pledge is expected to come up at an executive meeting of the state Democratic committees in New Hampshire this weekend. It\u2019s happening alongside the state\u2019s Democratic convention, which all the major Democratic presidential candidates are set to attend.\n\nThe DNC hosts regular training and produces a bi-weekly newsletter on cybersecurity and how to combat disinformation. But it did not answer whether it would vote to adopt the resolution crafted by state party chairs.\n\nPOLITICO asked all six national political committees and campaign arms from both parties whether they had a codified policy in place on disinformation.\n\nThe Republican National Committee repeatedly refused to say it would not use such tactics, even as it answered other inquiries about its cybersecurity efforts. The RNC encourages its employees, state parties and staff to stay alert on all platforms and notify the RNC to suspicious activity taken against their campaigns.\n\nThe National Republican Senate Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee did not respond. The National Republican Congressional Committee refused to answer, despite referring POLITICO to reporting on its newly launched cybersecurity program. The NRCC has also refused to sign onto a pledge circulated by Democrats to not used hacked materials against each other.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has pledged not to use hacked information against Republican House candidates. And committee staff is dedicated to combating the influence of disinformation tactics, not promoting it, according to a DCCC aide.\n\n\u201cThe DCCC takes the threat of cyber-attack very seriously and continues to work in concert with outside experts and dedicate in-house staff to combatting attacks on the DCCC,\u201d said committee spokesman Cole Leiter, \u201cas well as the distribution of disinformation in the 2020 election cycle.\u201d\n\nNatasha Korecki contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "Pressure is mounting on the national party to adopt an official stand on the use of deceptive tactics.", "authors": ["Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/42/4b/57fa4ebf4cc5bdcbd4dc7ebfffb6/190906-biden-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
