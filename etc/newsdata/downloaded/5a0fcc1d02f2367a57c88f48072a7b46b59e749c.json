Until then Dinamo Zagreb had stymied England\u2019s champions, yet 10 minutes after entering Sterling had a 10th goal in 12 appearances and City were cruising to a second victory and had Group C in their control.\n\nThe forward completed a scintillating cameo by creating Phil Foden\u2019s second on 95 minutes.\n\nSerge Gnabry grabs four in Tottenham\u2019s 7-2 home humbling against Bayern Read more\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a player who is always there, he has this talent,\u201d Guardiola said of Sterling. \u201cHe loves to score goals, you always have that feeling. He said a few days ago he missed chances at Everton [where he also scored] but he was always thinking of the next one. I think still he can improve his finishing. Today the pass for Phil was perfect. But still there is a gap to be even more clinical \u2013 but it\u2019s important that all the time he\u2019s there and that\u2019s why he\u2019s been able to score the goals.\u201d\n\nGuardiola made five changes from the victory at Everton. Kevin De Bruyne was omitted due to a groin problem \u2013 his availability for the visit of Wolves on Sunday is in the balance \u2013 while Bernardo and David Silva, Benjamin Mendy, Jo\u00e3o Cancelo and Sergio Ag\u00fcero all came in. Sterling, Gabriel Jesus, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Kyle Walker were the others to drop out.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nZagreb had won their previous match 4-0 on Friday and arrived hoping to end a dismal streak of 12 consecutive losses in Champions League away group games. Guardiola\u2019s wish that City fans be \u201cseduced\u201d by the competition was not answered during the pre-game anthem, which was booed as has become customary at the Etihad, and the contest was stopped almost instantly following kick-off when Rodri fell awkwardly. This may have affected City\u2019s rhythm because they were slow to settle, with one needlessly loose pass from Ag\u00fcero indicative of the wider problem.\n\nChampions League roundup: Icardi wins it for PSG, Higua\u00edn on target for Juventus Read more\n\nGuardiola had again plumped for the centre-back pairing of Fernandinho and Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi but neither they nor the rest of the defence could stop Dino Peric rising to head at Ederson\u2019s goal from a free-kick. The effort went too high.\n\nYet action in the visitors\u2019 area was served up on a near-permanent loop until half-time, Ag\u00fcero repeatedly receiving the ball and looking to fire a shot off or find Riyad Mahrez.\n\nWhat kept the score level was a dogged Dinamo rearguard and the referee\u2019s refusal to award a penalty when K\u00e9vin Th\u00e9ophile-Catherine seemed to handball near goal. The latter incident was surely an example of what VAR is supposed to clear up but Nenad Bjelica\u2019s team were allowed to escape. Seconds later, David Silva also thought he had a decent penalty shout but Serdar G\u00f6z\u00fcb\u00fcy\u00fck was again not interested in awarding the kick. By the interval, City had somehow failed to breach Dominik Livakovic\u2019s goal though Guardiola\u2019s instructions may have been to simply keep on keeping on, given his team\u2019s dominance.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Silva goes to ground, but Manchester City were not awarded a penalty.

But as his teammates waited to be played in the No 9 dawdled and the danger fizzled out.\n\nZagreb soon committed their own howler, a mix-up between Peric and Livakovic letting the ball spill to Ag\u00fcero, who could not quite capitalise as the angle tightened. Next, a slick City corner ended with Ilkay G\u00fcndogan chipping the ball to the back post towards a lurking Ag\u00fcero before Livakovic cleared with a punch.\n\nReal Madrid\u2019s Champions League fate in balance after draw with Club Brugge Read more\n\nEleven minutes into the second period Guardiola had seen enough, and he took off the muted Bernardo Silva for Sterling in an attempt to find the killer touch that had been absent. City camped in the final third but frustration grew as the yellow wall put up by Croatia\u2019s champions remained firm. That was until, at last, the hosts made the breakthrough when Sterling hammered home a precise Mahrez cross and Guardiola celebrated with the home support.\n\nThe manager\u2019s decision to bring on Sterling had gained City the ascendancy they deserved. What they did not receive was a penalty when Petar Stojanovic took Sterling down \u2013 but the decision looked correct, Stojanovic connecting with ball first. It did however spark a Guardiola tantrum and the Catalan was booked \u2013 much to his chagrin. This, though, ended as a satisfying evening for him and his side, capped when Sterling broke clear to set up Foden, the midfielder slotting coolly home in the closing moments.\n\nOf the 19-year-old, who has never been selected for a senior England squad, Sterling said: \u201cI am buzzing for Phil and I want him in the national team, if he keeps going he will be there.\u201d It is indicative of City\u2019s depth that Foden is not yet a regular in their XI.", "description": "Goals from Raheem Sterling and Phil Foden secured Manchester City a 2-0 win over Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League", "authors": ["Jamie Jackson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d790374ea4ce1d41c85dea995c49b4113bcf50eb/457_191_1836_1102/master/1836.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4fd4763f2bdce906853be827cab2674c", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
