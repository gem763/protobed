In India, where prices hit a record in September, the rally comes as the country\u2019s growth slows, unemployment rises and a crisis of confidence engulfs the banking system. Its imports fell for a third month in September to the lowest in more than three years as jewelers cut purchases.\n\n\u201cBuying of gold during festivals and wearing it has been our tradition for decades,\u201d according to Manish Kotekar, a 28-year-old taxi driver in Mumbai. \u201cWe have been waiting for prices to drop before buying gold as the rates are too high,\u201d and if prices don\u2019t go down below current levels by Diwali, \u201cwe may not buy this year. It is just not within our budget to buy at these prices.\u201d\n\nBenchmark gold futures in Mumbai touched an all-time high of 39,885 rupees ($561) per 10 grams in early September and while prices have come off about 4% since that peak, they\u2019re still more than 20% higher than last year. Diwali falls on Oct. 27 and is preceded by Dhanteras, the most auspicious day in the Hindu calendar to buy gold.\n\n\u201cDiwali is just a festival on the calendar this year and there is no festivity for jewelers in the market at all. It\u2019s very bad,\u201d Ketan Shroff, a director at Mumbai-based jeweler Penta Gold Pvt. and a former joint secretary of the India Bullion and Jewellers Association Ltd., said by phone. Companies are giving deep discounts \u201cbecause there are no customers.\u201d\n\nJewelers \u201cwill try to instigate demand, but in light of the general economic slowdown, no major change in demand prospects are likely before December,\u201d said Harish Galipelli, head of commodity and currencies at Inditrade Derivatives & Commodities.\n\nFutures on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd. fell as much as 0.2% to 38,403 rupees in Mumbai on Thursday, while overseas spot gold climbed as much as 0.8%.\n\nHere\u2019s what some of the bigger retailers are planning for the festive season.\n\nTanishq\n\nTanishq, the flagship brand of India\u2019s most valuable jeweler Titan Co., plans to cut the amount it charges to make jewelry by 25% for gold and a similar amount on the value of diamond jewelry. The charges vary across stores and can contribute as much as 10% to the total cost of an ornament. The company will also give jewelry to winners of a social media competition.\n\n\u201cThe jewelry industry has seen a slowdown in the last few months,\u201d said Rajan Amba, chief operating officer at CaratLane, which is 72% owned by Titan. \u201cHowever, we are optimistic that in the festive season things will start looking up,\u201d with customers seen opting for lightweight and affordable jewelry, he said. The company is giving deeper discounts on higher-end jewelry to encourage more sales.\n\nKalyan Jewellers\n\nThe Warburg Pincus LLC-backed jeweler is perhaps the most generous among the lot, planning to give away 300,000 gold coins via a weekly draw in addition to discounts and lower charges for making jewelry, according to Chairman T.S. Kalyanaraman.\n\n\u201cThe present dip in gold prices will further propel small ticket and token buying trends,\u201d he said. Kalyan has also partnered with banks to give additional discounts.\n\nMalabar Gold & Diamonds\n\nThe company is giving away gold coins on purchases above 15,000 rupees and is also allowing customers to place advance orders and buy jewelry either at the booked price or the rate at the time of delivery, whichever is lower.\n\n\u201cThe economic slowdown has impacted consumer sentiment as a whole across industries and gold jewelry demand in particular, but we are looking the period positively since festive and wedding seasons account for a major share of the annual revenue of jewelers,\u201d according to Chairman Ahammed M.P. Brides may opt for lighter jewelry sets during the wedding season given the increase in gold prices, he said. The peak wedding season in India begins soon after Diwali and gold forms an important part of Indian bridal trousseaus and as gifts in the form of jewelry.\n\n(Updates with gold prices in eight paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Swansy Afonso in Mumbai at safonso2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Phoebe Sedgman at psedgman2@bloomberg.net, Alpana Sarma, Jake Lloyd-Smith\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- India\u2019s festival of lights is bringing little cheer to jewelers in the world\u2019s second-biggest gold consumer.With less than a month to go before the Hindu festival of Diwali, a period when gold purchases typically peak, jewelers are lining up promotions to get buyers through the door as", "authors": ["Swansy Afonso"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ovBfEChCzR9SipolwEOGMg--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/c0ea963b40a2018173f4cecb6a480614", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
