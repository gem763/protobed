It was the first drone company to receive the approval in the U.S., beating out Amazon\u2019s Prime Air.\n\nWing partnered with Walgreens to perform the tests that began Friday in Christiansburg, Virginia. Walgreens customers in the town will be able to order from a list of more than 100 items and get them delivered to their doors by drones.\n\nThe drones will start with a flying radius of about 4 miles (6.5 kilometers) from Wing\u2019s distribution facility in Christiansburg.\n\nWing has also launched tests in Australia and Helsinki, Finland.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Google affiliate is using drones to deliver customers' Walgreens purchases in a test being run in a Virginia town.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/walgreens_drone_test_58524_c0-180-3201-2047_s1200x700.jpg?c13d7d1b8073c6c31085c6bbb4bc3fa24365d785", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
