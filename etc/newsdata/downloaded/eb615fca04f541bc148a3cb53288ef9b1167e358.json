Prosecutors also allege the pair petitioned U.S. politicians, including a congressman, to have the ambassador to Ukraine removed from her post.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Rebekah Donaleski, offered a glimpse into the \u201cvoluminous\u201d evidence that prosecutors have recovered so far on the two men who have become figures in the Trump impeachment proceedings, through \u201cdozens of search warrants,\u201d property searches, and subpoenas. The information includes emails and social media accounts and financial records from more than 50 bank accounts.\n\nDuring the hearing, Parnas\u2019 attorney, Edward MacMahon, told the judge that his client was told to invoke executive privilege in a letter that was submitted on Parnas\u2019 behalf by John Dowd, a former lawyer for the president, to a congressional committee conducting the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAsked by Judge Paul Oetken if Parnas has worked for the president, MacMahon said no, but that \u201che worked for Mr. Giuliani.\u201d MacMahon said that his concern stems from Parnas having used Giuliani as his lawyer for both personal and business dealings and that Giuliani also works for the Trump.\n\n\u201cThere are issues that we need to be very sensitive to,\u201d MacMahon said, not going into detail what those issues are. He continued, adding that he doesn\u2019t \u201cknow who is looking at all this evidence. If information gets out that we determine it is all privileged, we\u2019ve got a problem,\u201d MacMahon said in court.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t invoke [executive privilege], only the President of the United States and the government can,\u201d MacMahon said, telling the judge that he doesn\u2019t know how to proceed if the issue arises. \u201cI just wanted to raise the issue with you.\u201d\n\nProsecutors, seemingly shocked by the executive privilege claim, told the judge that while \u201cthis is the first time that we\u2019ve heard of this... we\u2019re happy to have a conversation.\u201d Donaleski, added that the government has already set up a \u201cfilter team,\u201d a separate team of prosecutors within their investigation, who ensure that possibly sensitive information does not get exposed.\n\nThe judge instructed the two sides to discuss the issues over the coming weeks. Parnas and Fruman are scheduled to return to court on Dec. 2.\n\nFlanked by his wife and attorneys, Parnas spoke briefly to the scrum of reporters outside the courthouse saying that he is looking forward to defending himself \u201cvigorously in court.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany false things have been said about me and my family in the press and media recently,\u201d he said, before adding that he is \u201ccertain that in time the truth will be revealed, and I will be vindicated. In the end, I put my faith in God. Thank you.\u201d\n\nHis defense attorney, Joseph Bondy, reiterated the sentiment, saying that his team \u201clooks forward to defending Mr. Parnas in the court based upon the evidence and not a smear campaign that\u2019s been driven by self-serving and misleading leaks apparently from the highest levels of our government.\u201d\n\nProsecutors are also looking into Giuliani\u2019s business dealings as part of their investigation, sources have told The Daily Beast and other news organizations.\n\nParnas and Fruman were arrested two weeks ago at Washington\u2019s Dulles airport as they were preparing to board a flight to Frankfurt, Germany, holding one-way tickets. When prosecutors learned that the two were leaving the country, they moved quickly to secure the indictments, which were issued a day before the two were apprehended.\n\nThe two have both been released on $1 million bail and are relegated to house arrest while they await trial. Their movements have been restricted to New York, where the trial is scheduled to take place and the Miami area where they both live.\n\nThe case is the first criminal prosecution related to an apparent Trumpworld pressure campaign to coerce Ukrainian officials into digging up dirt on Trump\u2019s political opponents for the 2020 re-election campaign, particularly former Vice President Joe Biden, an effort which is at the center of an impeachment inquiry underway by the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nParnas and Fruman are charged in four-count indictment with making illegal straw donations, including a $325,000 contribution to the group America First Action, which was first reported by The Daily Beast.\n\nThat donation actually came from an entirely different, undisclosed company owned by Parnas. It is illegal to donate to federal political candidates in the name of another person or entity.\n\nDuring an arraignment for David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin, two businessmen charged with conspiring with Parnas and Fruman to use straw donors to make illegal campaign contributions, prosecutors offered a broad brushstroke of \u201cfairly voluminous\u201d amounts of evidence they have gathered in the case from 10 search warrants and more than 50 bank accounts.\n\nParnas and Fruman are accused in the indictment in a separate scheme of helping Giuliani to dig up dirt on the president\u2019s political opponents in Ukraine.\n\nProsecutors say that scheme involved having the former ambassador to Ukraine recalled. Giuliani believed the ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, was standing in the way of investigations he and Trump wanted to see launched into Joe and Hunter Biden\u2019s work in the country.\n\nThe campaign-finance allegations against Parnas and Fruman are inextricably linked with that effort. Prosecutors say their extensive political contributions, beginning in early 2018, were designed to curry favor with American policymakers in an effort to advance Parnas\u2019 and Fruman\u2019s political and business endeavors.", "description": "Lev Parnas and Igor Furman pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to charges they violated federal campaign-finance laws.", "authors": ["Pervaiz Shallwani", "Pilar Melendez", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1875,w_3334,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571847147/RTS2SH71_1_ziee1f", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
