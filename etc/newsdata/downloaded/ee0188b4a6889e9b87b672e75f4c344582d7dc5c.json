REUTERS/Daniel Becerril\n\nMONTERREY, Mexico (Reuters) - In the courtyard of a jail that was shuttered last week, a man wearing a surgical mask and gloves used an underground scanner to search the earth for hidden graves in what was for decades one of Mexico\u2019s most violent prisons.\n\nThe Topo Chico prison closed last week after a 76-year history that saw riots, fires and bloody internal quarrels. A doctor who was in custody decades ago inspired one of the lead characters in the 1991 movie \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs.\u201d\n\nAuthorities have vowed to continue \u201cuntil we finish combing the whole area as it should be,\u201d Aldo Fasci, security minister for Nuevo Leon state told reporters. \u201cThe hardest part ... is underground, unfortunately, but it must be done.\u201d\n\nDozens of police and military officers with dogs continued to search on Tuesday. Inmates\u2019 relatives said they had disappeared at the site.\n\nThe prison is best known for a massacre in 2016 that left 49 dead and a dozen injured as warring gangs, the Cartel del Golfo and Los Zetas, fought for control of the site.\n\nAlthough Fasci said there were no signs of clandestine graves in the prison, policemen nonetheless extracted soil as dozens of dogs, mostly Belgian Shepherds, sniffed around. The government has said it plans to eventually convert the site into a public park and a museum to dissuade youth from a life of crime.\n\nThe reports of clandestine graves \u201care legends, but we have to confirm them or rule them out,\u201d Fasci said.", "description": "In the courtyard of a jail that was shuttered last week, a man wearing a surgical mask and gloves used an underground scanner to search the earth for hidden graves in what was for decades one of Mexico's most violent prisons.", "authors": ["Daniel Becerril", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438603085&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF971WC", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
