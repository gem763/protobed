Our consumer champion, Katie Morley, is here to help. For how to contact her click here.\n\nDear Katie,\n\nWe have just had a dire stay at the Premier Inn in Aldershot, Hampshire. When we entered the room we were surprised to see the base of the bed was ripped. We tested it and very loud creaking noises came with every movement.\n\nWe complained and were moved rooms. This time the bed was fine but there were large dark stains on the floor near the bathroom. It looked like either blood or human waste. We were offered to change rooms again, but this time at a premium. We decided to stay and placed a dry towel over the stain.", "description": "Has a company treated you unfairly?", "authors": ["Katie Morley", "Consumer Champion", "Mike Warburton"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/money/2019/10/18/TELEMMGLPICT000142725662-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqbp882ZYJlBFxnyQgxUcRsxrNyLJG0HyXpVXN1H1KVWw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
