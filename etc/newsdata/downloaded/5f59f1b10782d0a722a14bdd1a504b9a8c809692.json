Eventually, either the pitching implodes, the bats go silent, or fluke plays and errors are ruinous. The favorite celebrates and the underdog is vanquished.\n\nBut every now and then, a Kardiac Kids-team survives long enough to hoist the trophy after the final out. (Whether OUR hearts can withstand the tense drama along the way is a different subject.) In defying the odds and common sense, unlikely champions provide locals with fond memories for a lifetime.\n\nPrior to the NL wild card game, the Nats\u2019 provided playoff memories that were unforgettable but not fond. A quartet of NL bluebloods had shredded Washingtonian dreams. The Cardinals, Giants, Dodgers and Cubs \u2014 with stirrup-socks older than our upstart franchise \u2014 issued stark reminders that baseball, generally, mostly hurts.\n\nFor a change, though, postseason pain gathered its belongings and relocated across the diamond Tuesday. It made itself comfortable amongst the Brewers. It became fast friends with flame-throwing reliever Josh Nader and outfielder/MVP-replacement Trent Grisham. It also established a meaningful relationship with everyone else on Milwaukee\u2019s roster.\n\nThe Nationals were left for dead on May 23, when they owned the league\u2019s second-worst record. Their prognosis wasn\u2019t much better when Hader entered Tuesday\u2019s game with a two-run lead that needed two innings of protection. Washington wasn\u2019t supposed to prevail under those circumstances, wasn\u2019t supposed to break its streak of bad luck and poor timing in win-or-go-home games. Yet, here we are.\n\nI suggest not getting your hopes up as Washington faces the Dodgers. Not only does that guard against a letdown, it goes hand-in-hand with overriding feelings during the season\u2019s low point.\n\nAll of this is brand new for the Nats and fans. Past years featured runaway division titles and best-in-baseball won-loss records. Overwhelming success led only to NLDS heartbreak \u2014 including three times in series finales at Nationals Park. This season has been the exact opposite.\n\nGetting off to a horrible start. Battling to make themselves relevant. Fighting their way into contention. Holding on for a wild-card berth.\n\nThe team\u2019s remarkable turnaround and its penchant for comebacks kept hope alive among the throng on South Capitol Street as Milwaukee\u2019s first six batters created a 3-0 lead. But deep down inside, there was a nagging, unavoidable feeling of here we go again.\n\nSecond-guessers got a head start on the autopsy, chastising manager Dave Martinez for starting Max Scherzer instead of Stephen Strasburg, and for letting Scherzer bat in the third inning. A secondary cause of death was lining up to be Michael A. Taylor pinch-hitting for Strasburg in the eighth inning.\n\nBut Martinez had the golden touch in his first postseason game as a manager. He resisted a thought to pull Scherzer with one out and the bases empty in the third, betting that his ace would settle down. Besides, making a move that early could\u2019ve been viewed as panicking, not the vibe you want coursing through your dugout.\n\nThe pivotal eighth inning turned on Taylor\u2019s hit by pitch, Ryan Zimmerman\u2019s two-out, broken-bat bloop, and Anthony Rendon\u2019s two-out, full-count walk, setting the stage for Juan Soto\u2019s game-winning hit and bedlam in the stands.\n\nWinning one wild card game doesn\u2019t make up for losing four first-round series.\n\nBut the victory kept those memories sealed and made them less vivid, replaced with scenes that we\u2019ll joyfully replay forever.\n\nUnfortunately, those visions won\u2019t necessarily help Washington beat L.A.\n\nThe Dodgers won 106 games this season and they\u2019re loaded with arms and hammers, ranked first among NL teams in several pitching and batting categories. Having played in back-to-back World Series without winning either, they\u2019re also hungry to complete the task.\n\nMaybe that pressure will work in Washington\u2019s favor.\n\nL.A. won its division by 21 games and enjoyed at least a five-game lead since May 19. The Dodgers haven\u2019t been in true \u201cmust-win\u201d mode since losing Game 5 against Boston in last year\u2019s World Series. Conversely, the Nats are coming off an elimination-game thriller that was preceded by four months of playoff-like baseball.\n\nMomentum is nice.\n\nBut deep lineups and a reliable bullpen are great, which makes L.A. the favorite (and rightfully so). The Nats, 0-4 all-time in the NLDS, are poised to add one for the thumb.\n\nThat\u2019s OK. We\u2019ll always have Tuesday night.\n\nWin or lose this round, celebrate the Nats\u2019 opportunity to stay in the fight.\n\nBrooklyn-born and Howard-educated, Deron Snyder writes his award-winning column for The Washington Times on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
