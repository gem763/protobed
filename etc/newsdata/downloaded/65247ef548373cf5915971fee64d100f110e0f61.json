This is the second straight \u201cinformal\u201d meeting between the leaders, after their interaction in Wuhan in April last year. There\u2019s no set agenda, India\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe summit comes as China navigates a trade war with the U.S. and months-long protests in Hong Kong, while India is trying to revive an economy that\u2019s seeing the slowest expansion in six years. New Delhi has also expressed annoyance over China\u2019s support of neighbor and rival Pakistan regarding India\u2019s decision to revoke the special autonomous status of Kashmir, a region both Islamabad and New Delhi claim.\n\nThe priority of the meeting is likely to be reset ties beyond Kashmir and border tensions, said Jiang Jingkui, director of the Center for South Asian Studies at Peking University. \u201cI expect the two leaders would negotiate in principle to address the difference and make adjustment.\u201d\n\nXi and Modi will talk over a one-on-one dinner Friday night without their officials, who will be briefed later by the leaders, an Indian government official familiar with the program told reporters in Chennai. The two countries will issue separate statements Saturday after another one-to-one conversation before delegation-level talks, the official said.\n\nTrade Talks\n\nTrade, especially the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, is also expected to be a focus. China is India\u2019s second-largest trading partner with current two-way trade of $87 billion, and the two sides have targeted $100 billion in trade by 2020.\n\nIndia is under increasing pressure to decide whether it will be a part of the China-backed grouping that seeks to conclude negotiations by November. The RCEP, which aims to create the world\u2019s largest trading bloc, is being seen as a champion of free trade amid a worsening trade war. India\u2019s primary concern is the pact may lead to an influx of cheap Chinese goods, which could further widen New Delhi\u2019s nearly $55 billion trade deficit with Beijing.\n\nThe irritants in the India-China relationship aren\u2019t new and experts say it\u2019s unlikely the weekend meeting between Xi and Modi will lead to any major shifts.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s unequivocal support for Pakistan on Kashmir will be one of the challenges toward making this summit productive,\u201d said Harsh Pant, professor of international relations at King\u2019s College London. \u201cBut India has to have a relationship with China, it needs to engage with China and bring down temperatures as such. That\u2019s what this meeting may achieve.\u201d\n\nBorder Tensions\n\nJust days ahead of the weekend summit, Xi hosted Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Imran Khan in Beijing and described the relationship with Islamabad as a \u201cunique all-weather strategic partnership.\u201d He vowed to support Islamabad\u2019s \u201ccore interests and key concerns\u201d in Kashmir.\n\nIndia\u2019s foreign ministry responded with a statement reiterating its position that Kashmir is an integral part of India and \u201cit is not for other countries to comment on the internal affairs of India.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also ongoing tensions between India and China over border issues that date back over five decades, with Beijing laying claim to a large stretch of territory in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh -- which New Delhi rejects. The two countries clashed during a brief border conflict in 1962.\n\nThe last round of informal talks between Xi and Modi in Wuhan were also held amid border tensions. Then it was over the Doklam plateau, on China\u2019s border with Bhutan and near India\u2019s Sikkim state. Indian and Chinese soldiers were locked in a two-month standoff in the region -- the Wuhan meeting helped soothe some of those tensions.\n\nFrom India Xi heads on to Nepal for a state visit, a move that New Delhi will be watching closely. China has made considerable inroads in Nepal, traditionally under India\u2019s sphere of influence in the region. China and Nepal are expected to release a new blueprint for Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative that New Delhi has consistently criticized.\n\n(Updates with comments from official in the fifth paragraph)\n\n--With assistance from Dandan Li and Lucille Liu.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Bibhudatta Pradhan in New Delhi at bpradhan@bloomberg.net;Archana Chaudhary in New Delhi at achaudhary2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ruth Pollard at rpollard2@bloomberg.net, Muneeza Naqvi\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Ancient temples carved into massive rock faces along the ocean will form the backdrop to Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s informal talks aimed at resetting ties strained by border disputes and trade tensions.The leaders of the world\u2019s two most populous", "authors": ["Bibhudatta Pradhan", "Archana Chaudhary"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Pb0gFawtlE8kYNs2.LtbbQ--~B/aD0xNDIwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/a510065689edf9bfbddbb4ec1d1acefd", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
