Things were starting to unravel.\n\n\"I'd found out about one of them [his affairs] with the nanny. She used to take care of Mark when he was little.\n\n\"I'd been blind to it. You're young. You are working so hard and travelling all over the world. I think a lot of other people knew a lot more than me and didn't tell me.\n\n\"It was only when he'd been seeing another girl in the States for three-and-a-half years and they got found out that he had to tell me. I thought: 'To save this, I need to make myself more attractive.'\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\n\"For years Corky was what I call a jokester. He'd tease me with things like, 'You've got breasts like two currants on a breadboard' or 'You've got a sunken chest like a pirate's something or other.' He didn't like my teeth until I got braces at 25.\n\n\"It's like a little pickaxe that goes, chip, chip, chip, until, in the end, you think you are ugly.\n\n\"He said the affairs were just about sex. 'It's nothing to do with you. I love you,' he told me. But I never got a grip around that. That's when I got these.\n\n\"I thought I'd have this fantastic bust and everyone would look at me and think I was amazing.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"After the operation I did feel fantastic: I'd put a bra on and I had a cleavage.\"\n\nHowever her marriage ended despite the surgery and Shirley is now in a happy relationship with actor Danny Taylor who is 13 years her junior. They met last Christmas.\n\nShirley's mum and auntie both have cancer and she lost another auntie to the disease, so when she received a warning during a mammogram, she decided that it was time that the implants were removed.\n\nShirley said: \"So what if you've got a smaller bust? I think it's only since I've been with Danny that I've realised that.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"When I told him I wanted to remove my breast implants, we sat down and spoke about it. I'm 150 per cent self-conscious that I'm older than him. He's 100 per cent with me on this.\"\n\nShirley's operation has been scheduled for October 29.\n\nThe popular TV judge is said to have the backing of her bosses at the BBC to have the surgery midway through the current series of Strictly.\n\nShe told The Sun: \"My doctor says I have recuperation of a week, but I want to do Strictly on the Saturday night.\"\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\nThere have been further health issues that are thought to have been attributed to the implants, with Shirley complaining of chronic fatigue.\n\nIt is this that is believed to cause the chronic fatigue which Shirley says she has \"suffered with even over the last year.\"\n\nShirley will reject the idea of having smaller implants as she doesn't \"want any foreign bodies in my body.\u201d", "description": "The 59-year-old had her bust increased from 32B to 34DD in 2002 while she was with her second husband Corky Ballas", "authors": ["Lorraine King", "Image", "Bbc", "Internet Unknown", "Daily Record", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20651907.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EHP_CHP_181019SCD_6586JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
