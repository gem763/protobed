However, it's clear that her many accomplishments are both unprecedented and even more magnificent than those of history's most lauded athletes.\n\nAs if anyone needed a reminder of the 22-year-old's brilliance, Biles put on a record-breaking clinic at the gymnastics world championships in Stuttgart, Germany, this past week.\n\nSimone Biles performs a routine on the balance beam at the 2019 world championships. Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images\n\nShe came home with a whopping five gold medals to raise her overall world medals count to 25 \u2014 the most of any gymnast, male or female, in the history of the sport. With her definitive gold-medal performance on the balance beam Sunday, Biles broke the record of 23 total medals at worlds, which Vitaly Scherbo of the Soviet Union and Belarus set a year before the wunderkind was born.\n\nThough Biles is consistently the heavy favorite regardless of the event she's competing in, her victory on the beam was far from a guarantee. The Columbus, Ohio, native took home the gold in 2014 and 2015, but her recent history has been mixed. She lost her balance and settled for bronze medals in the event at both the 2016 Rio Olympics and 2018 world championships.\n\nSo when she did secure the victory, Biles allowed herself a moment of jubilation and jumped out of her seat to celebrate.\n\nLater, she secured a widely-expected victory in the floor exercise to break the record again.\n\nIn addition to her first-place finishes in the floor exercise and on balance beam, Biles took home gold medals in the all-around, vault, and team competitions, increasing her gold medal count to a whopping 19.\n\nBut if the sheer volume of victories Biles has amassed is impressive, then the fashion in which she's attained them can only be described as staggering. She unquestionably left her competition in the dust in every single event. Biles secured gold by more than half of a point in both vault and balance beam before earning a full point more than the next-highest scorer in the floor exercise. And in the all-around event, Biles was truly competing in a league of her own, racking up an impressive 2.1 points more than silver medalist Tang Xijing of China.\n\nIn a sport that is more often decided by tenths or hundredths of a point, as The New Yorker's Eren Orbey points out, Biles comparably astronomical margins of victory would have been unfathomable before she first joined the US women's national team in 2013.\n\n\"This is really the best worlds performance I have ever put out,\" Biles said on Sunday, according to the New York Times.\n\nSimone Biles performs a mind-bending triple-double during her gold medal-winning floor routine Sunday.

In Rio, Biles took the top prize in team, all-around, vault, and floor and tacked on the bronze in balance beam for good measure.\n\nThis time around, it appears she's entering the Olympic games, having cemented her dominance even further. In addition to regaining her confidence on the beam, Biles has continued to push herself in other areas of competition. Biles consistently nails skills so technically difficult and beyond the abilities of her competitors \u2014 or any gymnast ever, for that matter \u2014 that they've been named in her honor.\n\nAnd because gymnastics scoring rewards athletes for the difficulty of their planned routines and subtracts points for any deviation from the perfect performance, Biles is almost always afforded a heretofore unprecedented amount of leeway. At worlds last year, she famously competed while battling a kidney stone and, despite multiple falls and uncharacteristic errors, still came away lightyears ahead of the field.\n\nSimone Biles poses with one of her gold medals from the 2018 world championships.

She has also done so amidst sexual abuse scandals and filings for bankruptcy that have amounted to the most tumultuous period in USA gymnastics' history.\n\nThe summer Olympics in Tokyo will serve as her victory lap. The gymnastics virtuoso already announced her intention to retire after the upcoming games, and it's more than likely she'll cap her career with a slew of resounding victories.\n\nAnd even though she'll walk away from competition without rivaling the medal count or longevity of Olympic legends like Phelps or Usain Bolt, Biles will almost certainly have enjoyed the single most impressive international career of any athlete on the planet, past or present.", "description": "The 22-year-old wunderkind has been leaving her competition in the dust for years, and it's unlike anything we've ever seen from another athlete.", "authors": ["Meredith Cash"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da4c0b7cc4a0a16356690b2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
