Thank you to @BikersForTrump for your endorsement. Help is on the way!#lagov #Doc4Gov https://t.co/htWLNNErs5 \u2014 Dr. Ralph Abraham (@DocAbraham) October 10, 2019\n\nAbraham has fought for President Trump\u2019s America First agenda while in Congress and on the campaign trail. This Tuesday, he proposed H. Res. 620, a resolution that, if passed through the House, would remove House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and expel her from the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Louisiana Republican called Pelosi\u2019s impeachment inquiry a \u201cvicious crusade\u201d against President Trump, and, therefore, Pelosi must be expelled from the House and her role as the leader of the House.\n\nAbraham said in a statement Tuesday:\n\nNancy Pelosi\u2019s vicious crusade against our lawfully-elected President is nothing more than a politically-motivated witch hunt and it must be stopped. She has disgraced the people\u2019s House and weaponized the Speaker\u2019s gavel for her party\u2019s political gain. House Democrats spent nearly three years obsessed with election meddling only to dwarf any such efforts with their own deceitful plan to nullify the 2016 election and prevent President Trump from winning in 2020. I have introduced a resolution calling for her to be expelled from the House and for the Speaker\u2019s Office to be vacated.\n\nRep. Abraham, who is running for Louisiana governor, told Breitbart News Sunday that Democrats\u2019 impeachment \u201cinsanity\u201d has \u201cenergized\u201d Louisiana Republican voters ahead of the gubernatorial election.", "description": "Bikers for Trump endorsed Rep.
