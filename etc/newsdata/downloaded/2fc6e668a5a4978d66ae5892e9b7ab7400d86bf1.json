It doesn't teach you to govern. It teaches you to win. That's what it's about.\"\n\nShocking and unpleasant\n\nLike the novel before it, Agent Running In the Field taps into the disillusionment of ageing spies who turn their backs on the British establishment after years of loyal service because the cause they once espoused has gone.\n\n\"There are a whole lot of things about the secret world that are shocking and unpleasant, but in the years when I worked for it there was at least a motive,\" le Carr\u00e9 says. This motive, of course, was to win the Cold War, which at its most basic level was a war governed by opposing ideologies.\n\nLe Carr\u00e9 got his first taste of \"the secret world\" in 1949 at 17 after running away from his English boarding school, which he detested. He ended up in Bern, Switzerland, where he came to the attention of a Swiss MI6 station while he was studying foreign languages at a local university. They soon tapped him for trivial jobs. \"I didn't quite know who I was working for then, but I was filled with a Boy Scout feeling of loyalty at that age because my wartime experience had produced only heroes \u2014 male heroes, school masters who came back in uniform,\" he says.\n\nThe contrast with le Carr\u00e9's con man father, Ronnie, whose wayward life inspired his mesmerising novel A Perfect Spy (1986), could not have been more pronounced. \"I didn't have any kind of orthodox upbringing,\" says le Carr\u00e9, who chose a French-sounding pen name to complement his birth name, David Cornwell. \"I had to write my own ethics and morality, if you like.\"\n\nI had to write my own ethics and morality, if you like. \u2014 John le Carr\u00e9\n\nAfter college, le Carr\u00e9 completed two years of compulsory military service, which included running British agents into Soviet-occupied Austria. Then he returned to England and began working for MI5, the domestic branch of the British Security Service. After studying at Oxford and teaching at Eton he was recruited by MI6, the service's foreign branch, in 1960. He left MI6 in 1964 to focus full-time on writing when his career exploded with the publication of his third novel, The Spy Who Came In From the Cold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat novel was inspired by the time le Carr\u00e9 spent running agents between West and East Germany, which left him with a deep love of German culture and language. Today he finds he can only sit down to a book for a couple of hours straight if it's in German. \"I assume I'm dyslexic because I'm a terribly slow reader and with time I get slower and slower,\" he says. \"But I find German probably just starts the old clock going of my student years. So I can sit down and really settle to a Thomas Mann short story.\"\n\nAt 88, John le Carr\u00e9 is publishing his 25th novel. Supplied\n\nLe Carr\u00e9, who accepted Germany's Goethe Medal for his life's work in 2011, believes an opportunity was missed when the Berlin Wall came down in 1989. \"There was no great leader who came forward and said 'Listen, this is the moment to redesign the world,'\" he says. \"We had a great bit of after-lunch sleep and after that, what was there left to work with?\"\n\nLe Carr\u00e9 is furious that a similar \"sleepwalk\" of even more damaging proportions is being perpetrated with Brexit. \"It began in the big landed houses of England,\" he says. \"That's where the Brexit fantasy, the nostalgia for the suspicion of your German and your Frenchman and those chaps who weren't much use in the war, that's where that was born.\"\n\nA family enterprise\n\nIn Agent Running in the Field the fallout from Brexit ends up enabling \"a covert Anglo-American alliance with the dual aim of undermining the Social Democratic institutions of the European Union and dismantling our international trading tariffs\".\n\nSound far-fetched? British journalist and McMafia author Misha Glenny, who lent his expertise to details of Czech and Russian geopolitics in the novel, has been impressed by how ahead of the curve le Carr\u00e9 often is. \"In the late 1990s he wrote Single & Single, which was ... incredibly perspicacious about what the economic impact of the collapse of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union would be,\" Glenny says.\n\nAccording to French-British lawyer Philippe Sands, le Carr\u00e9 bounces many of his ideas off his second wife, Jane Cornwell. \"I think Jane plays a very important role intellectually,\" says Sands, who bonded with le Carr\u00e9 over their opposition to the 2003 Iraq War and checks his manuscripts on points of law. \"She is utterly on top of every detail in his books.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCornwell, a former book editor at Hodder & Stoughton, also types, which le Carr\u00e9 doesn't. \"I write in longhand,\" he says. \"I like to see it come back beautifully arranged in type and then hack it up and begin again. So Jane and I have worked on that process for the last 55 years or so.\"\n\nFamily also plays a big part in adaptations of le Carr\u00e9's novels for the screen. Two sons from his first marriage, Simon and Stephen, founded the production company The Ink Factory in 2010, which has produced films like A Most Wanted Man and television miniseries like The Night Manager and The Little Drummer Girl.\n\n\"One of the biggest joys of my life, the greatest fun, the biggest romps, was doing The Night Manager with the boys,\" le Carr\u00e9 says. \"It's an amazing father-son relationship completely reversed: They're now the bosses and they consult me, pick me up and put me down as they wish.\"\n\nJohn le Carr\u00e9 loved working on the screen adaptation of \"The Night Manager\" with his two sons. BBC First\n\nAccording to le Carr\u00e9, The Ink Factory now plans to do new television adaptations of all the novels featuring Cold War spy George Smiley \u2014 this time in chronological order. \"That means that if you actually go back to the first big conspiracies in The Spy Who Came In From the Cold you've got to consider how Smiley ages and how young he was at that time,\" le Carr\u00e9 says. That would mean finding an actor who can play younger than the Smiley incarnated by Gary Oldman in the film version of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Le Carr\u00e9 says that his sons are interested in casting British actor Jared Harris, whose performance they all admired in the recent TV miniseries Chernobyl.\n\nFor now, though, le Carr\u00e9 has other things on his mind. He and Jane are planning to take part in the People's Vote march against Brexit in London on October 19. \"We worked with Europe for 47 years, and are espoused for better or worse to those 27 countries,\" le Carr\u00e9 says. \"Now the government is trying to sell us the idea that we've got enemies. Excuse me, but this is not patriotism. This is nationalism.\"\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "The spymaster takes aim at Brexit and Boris Johnson in his 25th novel, to be published next week.
