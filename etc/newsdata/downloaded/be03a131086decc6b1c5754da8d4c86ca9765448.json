The ever-present risk President Donald Trump might upend everything with a fresh tweet has been compounded in recent days as investors eye the trade war with China and a conflict in the Middle East.\n\nAdding to the fog on Tuesday: It\u2019s unclear whether analyst earnings-per-share estimates will include write-downs for banks\u2019 holdings in other publicly traded companies, like JPMorgan\u2019s and Goldman\u2019s stakes in Tradeweb Markets Inc., Goldman\u2019s stake in Uber Technologies Inc., and JPMorgan\u2019s relationship with WeWork.\n\nTuesday will be like \u201cdrinking from a fire hose,\u201d Wolfe analyst Steven Chubak said in a phone interview. He\u2019s betting JPMorgan\u2019s release and CEO Jamie Dimon\u2019s comments will garner increased attention, because the bank\u2019s results hit first -- around 6:45 a.m. -- and investors will have extra time to ponder JPMorgan before Goldman, Citi and Wells come out.\n\nDuring the morning crunch, investors should focus on \u201cmitigating factors\u201d like market share capture for JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs and cost cuts for Citigroup and Wells Fargo, Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Alison Williams suggested. That\u2019s particularly important as there\u2019s little clarity on interest rates, she said.\n\n\u201cCosts are relatively more critical for Citi as the incoming Wells Fargo CEO may re-base targets and tweak strategy,\u201d she said. \u201cMarket share opportunities should support JPMorgan, but progress is more important for Goldman\u2019s trading and fees in the third quarter.\u201d\n\nWolfe\u2019s Chubak will keep a close on loans and credit updates. He expects a noisy quarter for Wells Fargo, and will listen for comments on Goldman\u2019s credit card with Apple. He\u2019ll also be on the lookout for comments on turmoil in the repo market and for any responses to potential questions about the 2020 elections and Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s agenda.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been injecting liquidity into the funding markets since Sept. 17, and will continue to do so through the end of the year. It announced on Friday that it will buy $60 billion per month in Treasury bills at least through the second quarter of 2020 to add reserves back into the system to a level of abundance policy makers desire. Officials had attributed the volatility in the funding markets to a drop in bank reserves below ample levels.\n\nKeep an eye on \u201cthe impact in the noise,\u201d said Alan McKnight, chief investment officer in wealth management at Regions Bank, with about $45 billion in assets under management. He will be listening to bank executives\u2019 comments on loan trends and capex for signals about where the economy may be heading. McKnight also plans to cross-check those comments with remarks from managers at industrial and tech companies later in the earnings season, he said in an interview.\n\nOn Friday, Bank of America analyst Erika Najarian said bank share performance may be fueled more by macro-economics than by earnings. It will be a case where \u201cmacro trumps micro,\u201d Najarian wrote, arguing that macro factors may be more impactful than the \u201cwell understood\u201d industry-level fundamentals.\n\nShe flagged \u201coutlier\u201d banks, including: JPMorgan, which is rarely a volatile stock during earnings, as investors have been asking about lending exposure to WeWork; Wells Fargo, as appointing Charlie Scharf as CEO may have put a floor under shares, and Citigroup, which is facing a \u201ccrucial\u201d quarter for its target of cutting expenses to meet its 2020 efficiency guide of about 53%.\n\nOn Monday, bank shares rose, with the KBW bank index gaining as much as 0.3%. Top index gainers included KeyCorp, Northern Trust Corp., Fifth Third Bancorp, and Bank of America Corp.\n\nHere\u2019s what analysts are expecting:\n\nJPMorganESTIMATES\n\n3Q adjusted EPS estimate $2.46 (range $2.32 to $2.54) (Bloomberg Data)3Q adjusted revenue estimate $28.47 billion (range $27.99 billion to $29.23 billion) (BD)3Q FICC sales & trading revenue estimate $3.09 billion (Bloomberg MODL).3Q equities sales & trading revenue estimate $1.68 billion (MODL)3Q investment banking revenue estimate $1.80 billion (MODL)3Q net yield on interest-earning assets estimate 2.42% (range 2.37% to 2.45%) (BD)Bloomberg Intelligence, Oct. 11: JPMorgan Share Gains, Opportunity Eyed Amid Rates: 3Q Preview\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- There will be a lot to watch when bank earnings kick off on Tuesday morning, with reports from JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo & Co. and money manager BlackRock Inc. all set to hit at or before 8 a.m.The unusual flood of reports from the biggest", "authors": ["Felice Maranz"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Yn6uFvYKJPcq99we3Qughg--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/97ab88cbe1022289d908c68cd703af64", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
