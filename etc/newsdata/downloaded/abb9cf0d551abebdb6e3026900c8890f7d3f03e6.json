Mr. Chang, Mr. Schlapp and Mr. Schneider said their views were strongly influenced by what they described as a harrowing experience in Hong Kong.\n\nThe home of Hong Kong media tycoon and democracy movement advocate Jimmy Lai, a frequent target of the Beijing government, was firebombed just hours after the ACU leaders had dinner there early this month.\n\nNo one was hurt in the 1 a.m. attack. Local reports said two masked men were seen throwing firebombs at the gate of the home, but state media in mainland China had been calling Mr. Lai a traitor for months. Mr. Schneider told The Washington Times that he believes Chinese government operatives may have been involved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Beijing has sent spies who masquerade as journalists, and these spies camp outside of Jimmy Lai\u2019s house taking photos of anybody coming in,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if those spies are doing recon or somebody else was responsible, but three hours after we left Jimmy\u2019s house, it was firebombed with Molotov cocktails.\u201d\n\nActivist detained\n\nA central reason that Mr. Schneider and the others traveled to Hong Kong was to show solidarity with another leading pro-democracy activist, Andy Chan.\n\nPro-China Hong Kong authorities detained Mr. Chan early this month while he was attempting fly to Tokyo. Mr. Chan was scheduled to be a keynote speaker at the annual Japanese Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nThe ACU criticized the detention and warned that it would not be the last time that the Chinese Communist Party hears from the organization. \u201cThe battle between freedom and authoritarianism will not end with the communists raising a victory flag,\u201d the ACU said in a Twitter post.\n\nThe protests were sparked in June when a Beijing-appointed city administrator moved to enact an extradition law that opponents said would put residents of semi-autonomous Hong Kong at risk of being sent to China, where they could face politically motivated trials.\n\nSome saw the law as an open threat by China \u2014 which is under increasing economic strain from its trade war with Washington \u2014 to the autonomy of private banks and other businesses run from Hong Kong because extradition could potentially be used to coerce the heads of such firms.\n\nThe proposed law has been withdrawn in the face of widespread popular outrage, but the protest movement has increased its momentum. Demonstrations have taken on a wider, pro-democracy scope with demands for free elections in Hong Kong. Adding a pro-American strain, some protesters wave U.S. flags and even sing \u201cThe Star- Spangled Banner.\u201d\n\nThe situation escalated last month when Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered Chinese military forces to begin massing near the mainland\u2019s border with Hong Kong. The move sparked fears of a crackdown akin to the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square.\n\nChinese authorities also ramped up allegations that American officials were meddling in Hong Kong and fomenting the unrest to tarnish Beijing\u2019s reputation against the backdrop of the U.S.-Chinese trade war.\n\nMuted response\n\nMr. Trump and his top aides, apparently wary of the impact their comments might have on delicate trade negotiations, struggled to find the right tone in responding.\n\nU.S. lawmakers from both parties warned China not to crack down, but the president offered only muted comments last month. He said the situation in Hong Kong was \u201cvery tricky.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump subsequently told reporters that \u201cit would be much harder\u201d for him to accept any trade deal with China if Beijing engaged in violence in Hong Kong.\n\nCritics had already pounced. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, said that \u201cif America does not speak out for human rights in China because of commercial interests, we lose all moral authority to speak out elsewhere.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans also criticized Mr. Trump. Mr. Schneider came to the president\u2019s defense in an interview with The Times, asserting that this \u201cis the first administration maybe ever to recognize that trade deals with China are really national security fights.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a long time, people were hoping engagement with China would help produce democratic reforms and eventually a peaceful nation. Those bets have now been shown to be bad bets,\u201d Mr. Schneider said.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump, I think, recognizes this threat and is addressing it head-on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a simple fight he\u2019s engaged in. It is a complex fight, and it\u2019s not one for the faint of heart.\u201d\n\nMr. Schlapp told The Times that nearly everyone he met on his trip to Hong Kong \u201csaid they\u2019d never seen an American president be this tough in terms of standing up for human rights and standing with them in their movement against China.\u201d\n\nMr. Chang credited Mr. Trump for conveying the message that a trade agreement would be difficult to reach if Beijing uses violence in Hong Kong, but he said the White House should be clearer about its support for the protesters.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t confront China in Hong Kong, we\u2019re going to be confronted by China closer to home,\u201d Mr. Chang said. \u201cThe big picture is Hong Kong is the front line of the fight for democracy and freedom, and the same regime that\u2019s encroaching on the autonomy of Hong Kong is also attacking our democracy and the notion of democracy itself.\u201d\n\nAll three of the ACU leaders pushed back against China\u2019s allegations of U.S. meddling in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a city of 7 million people, and there are at least 2 million who are organizing on their own, organically, to demonstrate against the Chinese Communist Party for their own liberty,\u201d Mr. Schneider said.\n\nAs for the ACU\u2019s trip to Hong Kong, Mr. Schneider stressed that the union is a nonprofit well known to the international community for having \u201cno ties to the U.S. government or any other government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no government or any single leader behind the movement in Hong Kong,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a bottom-up protest driven by the pursuit of freedom.\u201d\n\nMr. Schneider said the Hong Kong crisis is particularly vexing for Beijing, with a semi-autonomous government and economy at a time when China is hoping to use its economic clout and cash reserves to expand its global influence through such initiatives as President Xi\u2019s Belt and Road initiative.\n\n\u201cChina needs fuel in the form of cash to fund these projects that are very heavily debt-laden,\u201d Mr. Schneider said.\n\nHong Kong, he said, is the heart of financing for the Communist Party\u2019s push for global domination. If Beijing tries to absorb Hong Kong, then \u201cit would put a dagger in its own financing heart, causing its own collapse,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Catch-22 for Beijing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want a free Hong Kong to exist, but they can\u2019t exist without a free Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
