Everything was white. All you heard is crashing. The windows were blowing and were holding furniture against the shutters to keep them from caving in,\" Morgerman said.\n\n\"We barely made it to the eye, which is the calm center. And then when we came outside, the cars in the parking lot were just thrown every direction, mangled like they'd been in a blender.\"\n\nThe comments came as the Bahamas death toll from Dorian, which struck the area as a fearsome Category 5 monster, was raised to 30. That figure was only expected to climb in the coming days.\n\nHURRICANE DORIAN'S PATH: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nThe victims were from the Abaco and Grand Bahama islands, those hit hardest by the storm and its 185 mph sustained winds.\n\nMorgerman talked about how he and others survived the storm.\n\n\"I said get the kids away from windows.
