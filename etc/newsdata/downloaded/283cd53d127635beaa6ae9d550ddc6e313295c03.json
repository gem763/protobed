As the streaming wars heat up, it\u2019s investing heavily in the division to keep that audience. (New York Times)\n\nTalking point: The gambit comes as the November 12 launch of Disney\u2019s own streaming service looms. Netflix is losing the rights to all Disney content, including popular titles like the Pixar movie Coco, which will reappear on Disney Plus. The Mouse\u2019s service will also be cheaper than Netflix, at US$7 a month compared to US$13. But ahead of the Disney launch, Netflix has snapped up former Disney talent, including signing a multi-year deal with Kenny Ortega, known for the High School Musical franchise. It\u2019s also bought the rights to iconic youth-focused titles like NBCUniversal\u2019s Jurassic Park franchise, and has even made a deal with late author Roald Dahl\u2019s widow to revamp classic stories like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The effort has cost billions, but the biggest issue may be quality control: its new film Tall Girl, about a teenage girl who\u2019s ostracized for being over six feet tall, has debuted to weak reviews.", "description": "", "authors": ["Hanna Lee"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
