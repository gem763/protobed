Almost 293,000 flu cases have been recorded in Australia so far in 2019, with the outbreak beginning to take hold in March\n\nLast winter more than 4million primary school children were eligible for the vaccine, but less than 2.5million - 60 per cent - took up the offer.\n\nAnd among two and three year olds, who get vaccinated in their GP surgery, the rate was just 45 per cent.\n\nProfessor Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said: 'This year, more vaccines are available and every primary school child will be offered a flu vaccine.\n\nJUST HOW BAD IS THE AUSTRALIAN FLU SEASON? Almost 293,000 flu cases have been recorded in Australia so far in 2019, with the outbreak beginning to take hold in March. Australia's flu season usually lasts begins in May and lasts until October, with their outbreaks normally peaking in August. In comparison, there were less than 230,000 confirmed reports of influenza by the same time point - until the end of September - in 2017. That year's outbreak was the same that saw the rise of 'Aussie flu', after the country was rocked by a strain that eventually made it to the UK. Most of the Australian cases confirmed by laboratory tests earlier this summer - 57 per cent - were shown to be an unknown type of influenza A. Leading experts warned earlier in June that it is likely the UK will have an equally bad winter, saying the outbreak is 'very scary'. The flu season in the UK and the rest of the Northern Hemisphere tends to mirror what has happened in the Southern Hemisphere. The same strains of the virus will circulate north in time for the British flu season, which typically begins in November and lasts until March. Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive at NHS Providers, said at the time: 'The spike in flu we are seeing in Australia could be a worrying signal of what is to come for health and care services this winter. 'Planning for vaccinations is based on what happens in the southern hemisphere.' Australia's flu season peaks in July and August.\n\n'Children are \u201csuper spreaders\u201d of flu. Flu vaccination not only protects the children but it also protects other more vulnerable members of the community from a potentially horrible illness.\n\n'If you or your child are in an eligible group, make sure you get a flu vaccine. It\u2019s the best defence we have against an unpredictable virus.'\n\nIn total more than 25million people - around half the population - will be offered the free vaccine this year.\n\nVULNERABLE PATIENTS HAVE TO WAIT TWO WEEKS FOR THEIR JAB Thousands of vulnerable patients may have to wait two weeks to receive their flu jab due to a manufacturing delay, it was reported earlier this week. Pregnant women and weak people aged between 16 to 65 who hoped to be immunised next month face being turned away. Stock is being held up due to manufacturing problems at Sanofi Pasteur, one of the top NHS suppliers of flu jabs each winter. The company has written to GPs in England, alerting them of the situation ahead of the incoming flu season. Sanofi Pasteur supplies around a third of the flu jabs to GP practices every year in England, according to estimates. Almost 14million at-risk people in the UK took their free NHS jab last year, including more than 11million in England alone.\n\nThis includes all over-65s, pregnant women and people who work in the NHS.\n\nAlmost 293,000 flu cases have been recorded in Australia so far in 2019, with the outbreak beginning to take hold in March.\n\nAustralia's flu season usually lasts begins in May and lasts until October, with their outbreaks normally peaking in August.\n\nIn comparison, there were less than 230,000 confirmed reports of influenza by the same time point - until the end of September - in 2017.\n\nThat year's outbreak was the same that saw the rise of 'Aussie flu', after the country was rocked by a strain that eventually made it to the UK.\n\nMost of the Australian cases confirmed by laboratory tests earlier this summer - 57 per cent - were shown to be an unknown type of influenza A.\n\nLeading experts warned earlier in June that it is likely the UK will have an equally bad winter, saying the outbreak is 'very scary'.\n\nThe flu season in the UK and the rest of the Northern Hemisphere tends to mirror what has happened in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nIn total more than 25million people - around half the population - will be offered the free vaccine this year\n\nFEARS FLU VACCINE MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE This year's flu vaccine may not be effective, a top expert at the University of British Columbia warned last week ahead of the winter outbreak. Dr Danuta Skowronski told Stat News that this year's jab for the Northern Hemisphere - including the US, UK and Canada - is likely to be a 'mismatch'. Flu shots have to be newly developed ahead of each season based on predictions of which strains will be most active in the coming months. World Health Organization (WHO) officials choose the strains in February, and chose those for the Southern Hemisphere last week. For the Southern Hemisphere, officials chose influenza A/H3N2 and B/Victoria - different ones from the strains picked for the North. Dr Skowronski said that it suggests that the prior prediction was wrong and the Northern shots may be ineffective.\n\nThe same strains of the virus will circulate north in time for the British flu season, which typically begins in November and lasts until March.\n\nSaffron Cordery, deputy chief executive at NHS Providers, said at the time: 'The spike in flu we are seeing in Australia could be a worrying signal of what is to come for health and care services this winter.\n\n'Planning for vaccinations is based on what happens in the southern hemisphere.' Australia's flu season peaks in July and August.\n\nUK health chiefs have also slammed 'irresponsible' healthcare workers who fail to get the jab, warning they can spread the flu virus to vulnerable patients.\n\nThey revealed that uptake is as low as 40 per cent among staff at some NHS trusts - despite the target of 90 per cent coverage.\n\nLast year only 70 per cent of all health and social care workers got the jab, and the Government is reviewing whether or not to make it mandatory.\n\nProfessor Jonathan Van Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, said: 'There are trusts that do really well with uptake rates over 90 per cent, and others with uptake rates under 50 per cent.\n\nHealth officials estimate there were 1,692 influenza-associated deaths last flu season (file)\n\n'There is an element of professional irresponsibility. Staff can spread flu without realising it, from a patient perspective you don\u2019t want to be in a situation where you feel seven out of ten healthcare workers you meet are vaccinated, you would like it to be nine or ten out of ten.\n\n'There is a very strong professional responsibility to be vaccinated.'\n\nThe vaccination programme will be under way by October 31 - when the UK is set to leave the EU.\n\nProfessor Van-Tam said he does not anticipate any delays in delivery of vaccines for children due to Brexit, and that jabs for the over-65s are 'on track to be fully delivered by October 31'.\n\nHowever, around a third of the UK supplies that are manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur will not make it to the country until November 18, he said.\n\nThe company is one of three suppliers of the stock used to vaccinate people under 65 who are in the at-risk categories.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock has purchased an extra 400,000 doses of this vaccine to ensure there are enough supplies.\n\nHealth officials estimate there were 1,692 influenza-associated deaths last flu season.\n\nProfessor Stephen Powis, National Medical Director at NHS England, said: \u2018People might think that flu is just a cough or cold, but actually this serious illness can have devastating effects on people including causing death in some cases.\n\n\u2018NHS services across England have been working hard to prepare for the winter season, including staff in every part of the country getting their flu jab in the coming weeks, so now we\u2019re appealing to the public to Help Us, Help You by ensuring that you, your children or relatives take up the free and convenient flu vaccine as soon as you can.\u2019\n\nNHS is praised by vegans for rolling out the first ever egg-free flu vaccine\n\nGET YOUR FLU JAB, NHS STAFF TOLD Healthcare workers have a 'very strong professional responsibility' to get the winter flu jab, officials have warned. Figures show less than half of staff in the NHS and other care settings in some parts of the country were vaccinated last season. Frontline health and social care workers should also be offered the jab by their employer for free. Uptake rates are 'improving remarkably', with 70 per cent receiving the vaccination last season - up from 50.6 per cent in 2015/16. But Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, told a briefing that some areas saw uptake rates as low as 'in the 40s or 50s'. He did not say which areas saw the lowest rates, but the trusts are understood to be scattered across the country and tend to have a dispersed workforce. Professor Van-Tam said: 'We do know that flu infections, while sometimes severe, can also be asymptomatic, and staff can spread flu without realising it. 'I think there's a very, very strong professional responsibility on healthcare workers to be vaccinated.' There will be no repercussions for those who do not get vaccinated, with peer pressure and ease of accessibility thought to be more effective at increasing numbers. The vaccination programme will be under way by October 31 - when the UK is set to leave the EU. Professor Van-Tam said he does not anticipate any delays in delivery of vaccines for children due to Brexit, and that jabs for the over-65s are 'on track to be fully delivered by October 31'.\n\nBy Eleanor Hayward, Health Reporter for The Daily Mail\n\nThe NHS is rolling out the first ever egg-free flu vaccine in a move that has been welcomed by vegans.\n\nTraditional vaccines are made using fertilised hens eggs which are injected with flu and incubated while the virus multiplies inside it, before being sucked out and put into a jab.\n\nAround four eggs are needed to make a single vaccine, with up to 50million used to provide the UK\u2019s annual flu vaccine supply.\n\nThis has led to opposition from vegan activists opposed to the \u2018cruel exploitation\u2019 of chickens.\n\nBut this year Public Health England has introduced an egg-free vaccine that is cultivated in cells grown in the lab.\n\nBritain is the first country in Europe to offer the new type of vaccine, which protects against four strains of flu.\n\nProfessor Jonathan Van Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, said: \u2018The cell-based vaccine offers a clear technological advantage and helps to overcome our dependence on eggs.\n\n\u2018At the moment it\u2019s seen as an option alongside the egg-grown vaccine and will be available for all adults.\u2019\n\nExperts say the cell-based vaccine is more effective at protecting against the illness as it avoids the mutations that can occur when eggs are used.\n\nLast year the Vegan Society wrote to the Government calling for more animal-free vaccines, warning that many vulnerable patients were refusing to get the jab because it contains eggs.\n\nYesterday they welcomed the new cell-based jab, but warned that it still contains gelatin that comes from pigs and is grown in animal cells.\n\nThe new vaccine is manufactured in animal cells that are grown in a lab from a sample of liver tissue taken from a cocker spaniel back in 1958.\n\nPETA\u2019s science policy adviser, Dr Julia Baines: \u2018We're moving closer to a day when drugs are developed without using animals, and we'll all be safer as a result. Influenza vaccines that are made without relying on chicken embryos \u2013 like Flucelvax Tetra and Flublok \u2013 prevent thousands of hens from being used as egg-laying machines every year. This is a step in the right direction.\u2019\n\nSam Calvert, Vegan Society spokesman, said: \u2018It\u2019s better not to have the current exploitation of chickens that\u2019s involved in egg production, but unfortunately it contains gelatin which comes from pigs.\n\n\u2018We welcome research into animal-free vaccine alternatives, but it is important that vegans who need a vaccine for their health still take it.\u2019", "description": "Officials have expanded the vaccination programme to include all Year Six children, meaning an extra 600,000 children in the UK could be protected.", "authors": ["Eleanor Hayward Health Reporter For The Daily Mail", "Stephen Matthews Health Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/17/19261642-0-image-a-74_1570119518532.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
