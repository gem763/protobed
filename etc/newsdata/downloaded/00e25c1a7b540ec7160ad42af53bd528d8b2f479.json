And I was like, 'Oh my gosh.' And so my friend got up and moved and Harvey sat down. \"It was just such a level of gross entitlement and piggish behaviour.\"\n\nIn October 2017, the Oscar-winning movie mogul was accused of a long history of sexual harassment, assault and rape when a bombshell article was released in The New York Times, followed by another in New Yorker magazine. Since he's been accused of harassment and rape by more than 80 women.\n\nWhen asked if he ever bullied her, Jennifer said, \"I remember, right when [his ex-wife] Georgina's clothing line Marchesa was starting. That's when he came to visit me in London while we were shooting. He'd be like, 'Ok, so I'd like you to wear one of these to the premiere.' And I went through the book, and at the time, it wasn't what it is today. It was not for me. He was like, 'You have to wear the dress.' That was my only bullying.\"\n\nSpeaking about the Me Too movement, the actress says she \"absolutely\" thinks things have changed since, though \"there's still room for improvement\".\n\nJennifer appeared on the cover of Variety's Power of Women issue.\n\nSEE HER COVER HERE:\n\nThe Friends star is set to star alongside Reese Witherspoon in The Morning Show on Apple TV this November.
