Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), a 2020 White House hopeful, this week lambasted the closed-door proceedings of her own party\u2019s impeachment inquiry, echoing the frustration of Republicans.\n\nHouse Democrats have dismissed Republican demands that they release the \u201call\u201d the transcripts of the testimony provided by impeachment investigation witnesses and open the proceedings to the public.\n\nDuring an interview on Fox News Thursday, Gabbard questioned the argument by her fellow Democrats that the impeachment probe witnesses must testify in private to prevent them from sharing information.\n\n\u201cThat inquiry needs to be done in a very narrowly focused way, and it must be done transparently. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in those closed doors,\u201d Gabbard declared. \u201cI think that the American people deserve to know exactly what the facts are, what the evidence is that\u2019s being presented as this inquiry goes on.\u201d\n\nNoting via Twitter that \u201cthe rebuke of [House Intelligence Committee Chairman] Adam Schiff\u2019s [D-CA] Kangaroo Court is bipartisan,\u201d Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) cited a clip of the Gabbard\u2019s interview.\n\nThe rebuke of Adam Schiff\u2019s Kangaroo Court is bipartisan. https://t.co/1Xv7SxNovc \u2014 Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) October 25, 2019\n\nGabbard also blasted the Democrats\u2019 secret impeachment proceedings at the Fortune Most Powerful Women dinner at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, DC, on Tuesday night, saying the lack of transparency could hurt the \u201cintegrity\u201d of the process.\n\n\u201cPursuing impeachment for partisan reasons is bad for our country,\u201d she proclaimed. \u201cIt will be extremely divisive for an already divided country. I looked at the complaint and was very concerned. We need to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere needs to be a transparent and narrowly focused inquiry \u2014 I am disappointed with the lack of transparency,\u201d she added. \u201cThey have been behind closed doors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat has the potential to undermine the integrity of a nonpartisan investigation,\u201d the Hawaii Democrat also said.\n\nAfter opposing the idea, Gabbard expressed support for the impeachment inquiry during the last Democrat presidential debate in mid-October but cautioned against a \u201chyper-partisan\u201d process.\n\n\u201cUp to this point, I have been opposed to pursuing impeachment because it will further divide our already badly divided country,\u201d the congresswoman said in a September 27 statement, soon after House Democrats launched the probe.\n\nGabbard\u2019s criticism this week of the secret impeachment process came amid a feud with Hillary Clinton, a 2016 presidential candidate who recently accused her of being a Russian asset without providing any evidence.\n\nAlthough he acknowledged that the analogy is \u201cimperfect,\u201d Schiff has likened the impeachment inquiry to private grand-jury proceedings.\n\n\u201cIt is a political process and there are good reasons that part of that process should be conducted in the public eye, but I will tell you no two impeachments are alike,\u201d he conceded on October 14.\n\nSchiff has vowed to release the transcripts of the witnesses\u2019 testimony and open the process to the public. The leader of the impeachment probe did not say when he will allow the public access to the impeachment probe proceedings.\n\nThe Washington Post, however, reported on Wednesday, \u201cHouse Democrats are preparing to move their largely private impeachment inquiry onto a more public stage as soon as mid-November and are already grappling with how best to present the complex Ukraine saga to the American people.\u201d\n\nRepublican members of the three House panels conducting the impeachment probe are allowed to participate in questioning the witnesses. Still, they are not allowed to bring their own or issue subpoenas. House Democrats have also excluded Trump\u2019s lawyers from the hearings, denying them the right to access evidence and examine witnesses.\n\nThe White House is refusing to cooperate with the probe, arguing that it is \u201cillegitimate\u201d and unfair.", "description": "Rep.
