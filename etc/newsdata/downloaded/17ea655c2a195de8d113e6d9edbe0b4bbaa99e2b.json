She was just acquitted of murder.", "language": "en", "text": "A visibly shaking Brooke Skylar Richardson sobbed as the verdict was read Thursday: not guilty of aggravated murder. Not guilty of involuntary manslaughter.\n\nAt her sentencing Friday, the 20-year-old Ohio woman spoke publicly for the first time since the start of what her attorneys called a \u201cnightmare,\u201d a tabloid saga in which the former high school cheerleader was accused of killing her newborn two days after her prom in May 2017.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to say how sorry I was,\u201d she said. \u201cI can sometimes be selfish, but I would like to think that I\u2019ve become better in the knowledge that I\u2019ve upset everyone and hurt so many people with what I\u2019ve done. And I\u2019m forever sorry.\u201d\n\nAlthough jurors acquitted Richardson of the most serious charges, they convicted her of gross abuse of a corpse, a minor felony that carries a maximum sentence of one year. Judge Donald Oda rebuked Richardson for her \u201cgrotesque disregard for life\u201d and told her the child she named Annabelle would be alive if she\u2019d acted differently.\n\nHe sentenced her to seven days in jail and, with credit for time served, Richardson was allowed to go home.\n\nThe lurid details of the Warren County, Ohio, case \u2014 including ultimately recanted allegations that Richardson burned the baby\u2019s corpse before burying it in the backyard of her parents\u2019 house \u2014 drew national headlines and intense social media speculation.\n\n\u201cShe was living under a dark cloud for the past two years, frankly a nightmare,\u201d attorney Charlie H. Rittgers said after the verdict, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer.\n\nRichardson\u2019s ordeal began in spring 2017, as her senior year at Carlisle High School drew to a close and she prepared to start college at the University of Cincinnati. By that time, she had been pregnant for months \u2014 but no one knew. The bump barely showed when she wore a cheerleading uniform on the sidelines, or a bikini on spring break, or even when she wore a snug-fitting sparkly red gown to prom. Richardson\u2019s family told Cosmopolitan her weight often fluctuated because of eating disorders.\n\nThe teen did not learn of her pregnancy until April 26, 2017, when she saw a gynecologist for the first time, Cosmo reported. Her relationship with her boyfriend was progressing, and her mom thought it was time to consider starting birth control. But the doctor told Richardson she couldn\u2019t: She was already pregnant.\n\n\u201cUpon learning she was pregnant, Brooke burst into tears and told her doctor that she could not have this child and that she could not tell anyone about being pregnant,\u201d Warren County Assistant Prosecutor Julie Kraft said, according to Fox 19\u2032s video footage of the trial. \u201cAnd Brooke told no one. She did not tell her parents, her friends or the baby\u2019s father.\u201d\n\n[A teen said she buried her stillborn baby in the backyard after prom. Now she\u2019s on trial for murder.]\n\nProsecutors told a tale of a teenager who killed her baby out of fear that her college plans \u2014 and her \u201cgood girl\u201d image \u2014 were at stake. Defense attorneys insisted that the child Richardson named Annabelle was stillborn and the frightened young mother panicked about what to do.\n\nProsecutors said they did not know how the newborn was killed. But Rittgers said the baby girl was a lifeless pale at delivery. The baby wasn\u2019t breathing. The umbilical cord wasn\u2019t attached to the placenta. Recounting what her daughter eventually told her, Richardson\u2019s mother, Kim, told the Cincinnati Enquirer that Skylar cried as she cradled the baby for hours, waiting for it to open its eyes or cry or move. It never did.\n\nFinally, Richardson\u2019s mother said, the teenager grabbed a garden spade from the garage and retreated to the far end of the family\u2019s expansive backyard. She dug a hole between two pine trees and covered the small grave with flowers she\u2019d worn at prom. Still she told no one.\n\nHer family only found out when police called months later, after Skylar Richardson\u2019s gynecologist reported the baby\u2019s death to the Warren County coroner, leaving the cause of death blank.\n\n\u201cIt is so hard to believe that I had a grandchild that I never got to hold,\u201d her mother told the Enquirer.\n\nAfter the verdict Thursday, Richardson\u2019s attorneys blasted prosecutors for \u201covercharging\u201d the young woman and said they feared she might never escape the media attention. But Warren County Prosecutor David Fornshell said he still believes Richardson killed her child. He stood by his office\u2019s handling of the case.\n\n\u201cWe owed it to that little girl,\u201d the Enquirer quoted him as saying. \u201cIt had to be tried.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA fortune teller scammed a woman out of $1.6 million.
