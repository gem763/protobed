Clooney or Pitt?\u201d\n\nIn a televised call Monday, NASA astronaut Nick Hague answered Pitt \u2014 \u201cabsolutely\u201d \u2014 getting a big laugh. Pitt\u2019s Hollywood pal George Clooney starred in the 2013 space film \u201cGravity.\u201d Hague and the rest of the International Space Station crew previewed \u201cAd Astra\u201d a few weeks ago. The movie opens Friday down here on Earth.\n\nPitt portrays an astronaut who travels through the solar system to find his father. The film includes actual NASA shots of the moon and Mars.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d we do? How was our zero-G?\u201d Pitt asked from NASA headquarters in Washington.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

I got to imagine it was a lot easier for me to kind of enjoy the zero-G than it was you,\u201d he added, flipping in weightlessness.\n\nPitt noted the movie\u2019s spaceship was \u201ca bit cleaner\u201d than the station. After asking about spacewalking and seeing Earth from space, Pitt said, \u201cMost important question: Who controls the jam box?\u201d Answer: The astronauts take turns. With three Americans, two Russians and an Italian on board, the music has an \u201cinternational flair,\u201d Hague said.\n\nThe 20-minute chat ended with Pitt sharing, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to brag to my kids.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Brad Pitt, star of the new space movie 'Ad Astra,' had a burning question for an astronaut.
