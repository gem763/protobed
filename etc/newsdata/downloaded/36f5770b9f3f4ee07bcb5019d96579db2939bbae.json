The issue has resurfaced, after a story published in the New York Times that adds detail to an account from Deborah Ramirez, one of Kavanaugh's Yale classmates, who says he exposed himself to her at a party.\n\nThe story also includes a previously unreported accusation from someone who said he witnessed Kavanaugh\u2019s friends push \u201chis penis into the hand of a female student\u201d during the same period. The Times later revised its story to add the fact that the unnamed woman reportedly doesn\u2019t remember the incident. Much of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearing focused on a decades-old assault allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that the Times article\u2019s authors said they found \u201ccredible\u201d in their reporting. Kavanaugh denies all of the allegations.\n\nThe story also includes new claims that the FBI chose not to interview dozens of people who could have corroborated Ramirez\u2019s account or follow-up when a Democratic senator brought the new accusation to its attention.\n\nThe claims have reignited tensions over Kavanaugh\u2019s seat on the Supreme Court. Several Democratic presidential candidates have called for him to be impeached. President Trump, on the other hand, said Kavanaugh is being \u201cAssaulted by lies and Fake News!\u201d and said the Justice Department should \u201ccome to his rescue.\u201d\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate:\n\nMuch of the debate in recent days echoes the one that took place in the leadup to Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment to the court. Republicans have questioned the validity of the allegations and claim they are politically motivated. Many Democrats have reiterated their view that his alleged behavior, and their belief he may have perjured himself during his confirmation hearing, should disqualify him from the court.\n\nThe information in the New York Times story might not be enough to shift people from these entrenched postures, whether they applaud or scorn Kavanaugh\u2019s presence on the court. One of the story\u2019s writers lamented the \u201crush to judgment\u201d and \u201cabsence of truly introspective thinking\u201d while discussing the response to its publication on Yahoo News \u201cSkullduggery\u201d podcast.\n\nHowever, there may be consequences from the Kavanaugh saga being scrutinized in public again. The controversy has resurfaced at a time when the Democrats now control the House of Representatives and are in the midst of a presidential primary. Both of these factors could empower them to keep the issue in the news in a way they may not have been able to before.\n\nOne element of the new reporting that may lead to substantive action is intensified attention paid to the FBI's investigation into Kavanugh\u2019s behavior before his confirmation. Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) said the inquiry was a \u201csham\u201d that was hampered by pressure from prominent Republicans.\n\nWhat\u2019s next:\n\nDemocratic leadership in the House has thrown cold water on the notion of impeachment proceedings against Kavanaugh, citing the unlikelihood that the Senate would come close to enough votes to remove him. It\u2019s possible Democrats could launch their own inquiry into claims against Kavanaugh or whether the FBI\u2019s investigation was credible.\n\nRegardless, Kavanaugh's confirmation will likely be a major point of debate for the 2020 election, both at the presidential level and in crucial Senate races. It could be a defining issue in the reelection bid of Maine Republican Susan Collins, who is seen as casting a key swing vote in Kavanaugh\u2019s favor.\n\nPerspectives\n\nFrom the Left\n\nThe new allegations further erode the legitimacy of the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cIt was Kavanaugh who said in his opening statement to the Judiciary Committee at his 2018 hearing: \u2018The Supreme Court must never, never be viewed as a partisan institution.\u2019 But it\u2019s impossible not to view the court in exactly that way, thanks to a GOP determined to control it by any means at its disposal. It\u2019s why questions \u2014 about Kavanaugh and the court itself \u2014 will continue to haunt us.\u201d \u2014 E.J.
