The payout also dwarfs the next-highest total, $399 million in 2012, the first year of the refunds, according to a new analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation, which calculated the total rebate payments by reviewing federal filings.\n\nConsumers who get the rebates are expected to receive about $270 on average, but some policyholders could get as much as around $2,000. The payments, which will often come in the form of checks, must be sent to consumers by the end of September. For a family with a shared policy, the insurer issues one rebate.\n\nConsumers will get the rebates even if most or all of their premium costs were covered by federal subsidies.\n\nshare your thoughts Are you expecting a health insurance rebate? How will this development affect the national debate over health coverage? Join the conversation below.\n\nInsurers will pay out an additional $534 million to employers this year under the same ACA rule, and many employers are expected to pass along a portion of that to workers.\n\nUnder the ACA, insurers must spend the lion\u2019s share of the revenue they get from premium payments on health-care costs. For people who buy their own health insurance, if that proportion falls below 80%, the insurer must refund the difference to policyholders.\n\nThe large rebate total for 2019 largely reflects steep rate increases that took effect in 2018 for ACA plans, said Cynthia Cox, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s really driven by individual market insurers in 2018 overpricing their plans,\u201d she said. The hikes bolstered insurer profits but overshot the ACA\u2019s guardrails.\n\nThe payments come as the future of the 2010 law remains in doubt, as the Trump administration backs a lawsuit from several Republican state attorneys general trying to strike down the entire health law. At the same time, some Democratic presidential candidates have backed replacing the law with a federal health-care system.\n\nThe issue could come up again during Thursday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate. Former Vice President Joe Biden wants to preserve and build on the ACA, widely known as Obamacare, while also adding an option where people could buy into Medicare. Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts are pushing for Medicare for All, which generally would move every American, even those with employer-based coverage, to a government-run health plan.\n\nAmong the insurers with the biggest total expected payouts for individual plans are Centene Corp. , Health Care Service Corp., Cigna Corp. and Virginia-based Optima Health, which is owned by hospital system Sentara Healthcare.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe outlays aren\u2019t likely to have much effect on earnings because insurers have generally accrued for them in advance, said Matthew Borsch, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets.\n\n\u201cYou file your rates assuming you\u2019re going to come in above that 80%,\u201d said Geoff Bartsh, a vice president at nonprofit insurer Medica, which is paying out about $14 million in individual-plan rebates. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be in a position where we\u2019re sending out rebates. No one shoots to be there.\u201d\n\nMark Nave, a senior vice president at Highmark Inc., an insurer that is part of Pittsburgh-based nonprofit Highmark Health, said health costs in 2018 were lower than the company had projected when it boosted rates by 12% that year in Pennsylvania. Highmark will send out checks worth around $51 million in total to its individual policyholders in that state, in amounts ranging from $341 to $1,657.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got limited information on the population you\u2019re insuring\u201d when rates are set, he said.\n\nOptima Health, which sparked local pushback for steep rate increases, will be paying out $99 million, with an average of $1,850 per individual policy. The insurer ended up getting a $94 million payment via another ACA program designed to smooth risk for insurers, which it hadn\u2019t expected when it set its rates, said Dennis Matheis, president of Optima Health.\n\nIan Dixon, an app developer who founded Virginia consumer group Charlottesville for Reasonable Health Insurance, said the Optima Health rebates won\u2019t make up for the rate hikes local residents experienced. \u201cThey really don\u2019t compensate people for the overcharging,\u201d said Mr. Dixon. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even come close.\u201d Mr. Matheis said he was \u201ctotally sympathetic with the consumers.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Health Care Service said the company exceeded the 80% threshold for the \u201cvast majority of our customers in the states where we operate.\u201d\n\nCigna said it is sending out rebate checks to individual-market policyholders in five states and that they would be delivered by the end of September. Centene declined to comment.\n\nWrite to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com and Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com", "description": "Health insurers are expected to pay out a record $743 million to consumers this month under an Affordable Care Act rule that requires refunds if the companies don\u2019t spend a big enough share of premium dollars on health care.", "authors": ["Anna Wilde Mathews", "Stephanie Armour", "Anna.Mathews Wsj.Com", "Stephanie.Armour Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105570/social", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
