They have remained true to the ethos of the Fire and Rescue Service,\" said Bosman.\n\nStaffing levels are expected to return to normal at the City's 30 fire stations from Tuesday night.\n\nSamwu organiser Archie Hearne confirmed the agreement, and said the union was briefing firefighters on Tuesday afternoon about it.\n\n\"We will return today on the 24-hour shift system to normalise the working environment,\" said Hearne.\n\n\"Members have agreed and showed a willingness now in the meeting. We are satisfied to the extent that there is a process laid out.\"\n\nHe said that the City had intended interdicting the union from further labour action on Monday, but the parties had looked for alternatives.\n\nNow both sides will have to get down to the paperwork that everybody has to file before the matter can be heard.\n\nThere has been a disagreement about the allowance since September.\n\n\n\nAt that time, the City blamed the union for a \"misinformation\" campaign, saying the claim that they work 240 hours per month (80 hours' compulsory overtime), instead of the contracted 160 hours a month, was not true.\n\nThe City said that Fire and Rescue Service staff are not 40-hour workers and that Samwu is a signatory to an agreement that their hours be determined jointly between the City, unions and the SA Local Government Bargaining Council.", "description": "Cape Town's aggrieved firefighters will go back to work until a court hears a formal application regarding a dispute over standby allowances, the City of Cape Town says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4773/23f06f93c340485da89633c4c80d3575.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
