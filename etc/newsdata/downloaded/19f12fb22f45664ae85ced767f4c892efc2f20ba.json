In his autobiography published yesterday, he tells how Michael kept up the \u2018facade\u2019 for fear that going public could damage his career and chance of competing with stars such as Michael Jackson\n\nRidgeley, now 56, said the tragic singer was \u2018beset by confusion as a consequence of his sexuality\u2019 and struggled to \u2018define the reality beneath the public image\u2019.\n\n\u2018Beyond the close inner circle nobody really had a clue, so while the reality of maintaining the facade wasn\u2019t tearing George apart, some cracks were definitely starting to show,\u2019 he writes.\n\nHe adds that Michael\u2019s \u2018ambition to succeed had taken priority over everything else\u2019 including his ability to be honest about his sexuality.\n\n\u2018He was driven by an unstoppable desire to fulfil his potential, but that had come at a price,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018What the real implications were for George, I can\u2019t say, but I knew he was never comfortable with the added interest that came with Wham! hitting the big time.\u2019\n\nIn mourning: Wham! star Andrew Ridgeley admitted in his autobiography, which was released on Thursday, that he still has 'a number of questions' over George Michael's death\n\nHe said George was \u2018adamant his sexuality should be kept under wraps\u2019 which \u2018created a whole unwelcome extra level of stress for him to manage\u2019. Ridgeley, who said he never met any boyfriends that Michael might have had during his time in the band, added: \u2018He thought coming out would scupper chances of competing with artists like Madonna and Michael Jackson in the States.\u2019\n\nMichael refused to come out even after his boyfriend Anselmo Feleppa died from Aids in 1993. Ridgeley said that it had \u2018devastated\u2019 the star but he had been \u2018unable to discuss it in public\u2019. \u2018Had he spoken out earlier, who knows how differently things might have played out.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018While his confidence had grown as Wham! had been wound down, George was now struggling with what being George meant. What had be become? He was bothered about whether or not it was something he could live with.\u2019\n\nStill has questions: Following George's tragic passing on Christmas Day in 2016, Andrew explained in his book: 'Without any real closure, the grieving seemed terribly raw'\n\nMichael and Ridgeley met as schoolboys in Bushey, remaining friends until the singer\u2019s death on Christmas Day in 2016.\n\nIn the autobiography, entitled Wham! George and Me, Ridgeley details the moment Michael came out to him as gay in a hotel in Ibiza where they were filming the Club Tropicana video.\n\nHe tells how their friend and backing singer Shirlie Holliman was also in the room \u2018perched on a large sofa in the suite\u2019.\n\n\u2018George was still in bed. He smiled as I came in,\u2019 he wrote.\n\n\u2018The mood in the room was so relaxed and familiar, yet what George was about to reveal was clearly a big deal for him. \u201cI didn\u2019t know whether to tell you this\u201d, he said, looking across at Shirlie, \u201cbut I\u2019m going to. I\u2019m gay\u201d.\u2019\n\nDespite their close bond, Ridgeley admits in the book that he was sometimes \u2018envious\u2019 of Michael. He writes that, while he was \u2018amazed\u2019 by his friend\u2019s \u2018prodigious talent\u2019, it \u2018would have been fabulous to have some of that stardust sprinkled upon me\u2019.\n\nAlthough Michael\u2019s cause of death has been recorded as being due to a heart condition, Ridgeley said he still has many unanswered questions about his passing.\n\n\u2018He seemed to be in good health at the time and there are conflicting reports about the night that preceded his passing,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018That the circumstances of his death seemed unclear only compounded the distress. Without any real closure the grieving seemed terribly raw.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018A heart condition was eventually recorded as the cause of death, but there are still a number of questions. It now seems as if we may never know what really happened.\u2019", "description": "Andrew Ridgeley knew Michael was gay in 1983 when the pair were shooting Club Tropicana, but it was 15 years before he came out publicly.", "authors": ["Jennifer Rusenior Showbiz Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/08/19326258-0-image-a-9_1570259868832.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
