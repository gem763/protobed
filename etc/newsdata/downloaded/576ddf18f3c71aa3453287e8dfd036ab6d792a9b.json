In their view, it was just a prank.\u2019\n\nWe have looked around to see if tricking someone into eating meat when they are vegan or vegetarian is illegal, but so far we cannot laws relating to the practice.\n\nIn 2018 an investigation was launched into a chef who boasted about spiking a group of vegans\u2019 meals. She said \u2018pious judgemental vegan (who I spent all day cooking for) has gone to bed, still believing she\u2019s a vegan\u2019.\n\nShe said because she was so drunk she dismissed the \u2018odd\u2019 taste of the chicken nuggets (Picture: Getty)\n\nShropshire Council intervened and the chef quit after receiving death threats.\n\nSuspected gunman in deadly Germany synagogue shooting arrested\n\nThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Rupert Coville spoke about force feeding Guantanamo detainees who refused to eat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said: \u2018If it\u2019s perceived as torture or inhuman treatment \u2013 and it\u2019s the case it\u2019s painful \u2013 then it is prohibited by international law.\u2019\n\nHowever that contradicts the European Court of Human Rights which ruled that not all forced feeding is illegal. They would make an exception if it was to \u2018preserve the life of hunger strikers if shown to be medically necessary and not done for punitive reasons.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
