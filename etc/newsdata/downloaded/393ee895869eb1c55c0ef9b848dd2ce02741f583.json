Following on from a 16.45% rally on Friday, Bitcoin ended the day at $9,270.9.\n\nA particularly bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin rally from an intraday low $8,661.9 to an early morning intraday high $10,480.\n\nSteering clear of the major support levels, Bitcoin broke through the first major resistance level at $9,179.49 and the second major resistance level at $9,679.83.\n\nOf greater significance on the day was a breakthrough the 38.2% FIB of $9,734.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s first visit to $10,000 levels since 24th September was short-lived, however.\n\nBearish through the rest of the day, Bitcoin slipped back through the resistance levels to an afternoon low $8,888.9.\n\nThe pullback also saw Bitcoin fall back through the 38.2% FIB. Finding support late on, however, Bitcoin managed to wrap up the day at $9,000 levels for the first time since 24th September.\n\nFor the current week, a 2nd consecutive day in the green left Bitcoin up by 12.23%, Monday through Saturday.\n\nFor the bulls, the extended bullish trend remained intact in spite of sliding back through the 38.2% FIB. Bitcoin has continued to hold above the 62% FIB of 7,245.\n\nThe Rest of the Pack\n\nAcross the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a mixed day on Saturday for the majors following Friday\u2019s breakout.\n\nBitcoin Cash SV and Binance Coin joined Bitcoin in the green, with gains of 5.71% and 1.80% respectively.\n\nIt was red for the rest of the pack, however, with Stellar\u2019s Lumen (-2.48%) and Bitcoin Cash ABC (-2.14%) leading the way down.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP (-1.48%), EOS (-1.40%), Ethereum (-0.90%), and Litecoin (-0.16%) saw more modest losses on the day.\n\nFor the current week, Bitcoin Cash SV continued to lead the way, surging by 48.42%, Monday through Saturday.\n\nBitcoin Cash ABC was a distant second, rising by 13.59%, with EOS (+7.10%) also making solid gains.\n\nIn spite of the Friday rally, Stellar\u2019s Lumen (-0.31%) and Ripple\u2019s XRP (-0.18%) bucked the trend.\n\nThrough the current week, the total crypto market cap rose from a Wednesday low $202.69bn to a Saturday high $262.07bn. At the time of writing, the total market cap stood at $242.53bn.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s dominance jumped back to 68% levels off the back of Friday\u2019s 16.5% rally and Saturday\u2019s gain.\n\nThis Morning\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.86% to $9,191.5. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to an early morning high $9,424.2 before falling to a low $9,165.\n\nBitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.\n\nElsewhere, it was a sea of red across the crypto board. Bitcoin Cash ABC led the way down, falling by 1.97%.\n\nBinance Coin (-1.83%), EOS (-1.69%), Bitcoin Cash SV (-1.66%), and Litecoin (-1.56%) also saw heavy losses early on.\n\nFor the Bitcoin Day Ahead\n\nFor the day ahead, Bitcoin would need to move through to $9,470 levels to support a run at $10,000.\n\nSupport from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break out from the early morning high $9,424.2.\n\nBarring another broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin will likely come up well short of the first major resistance level at $10,279.97.\n\nThe 38.2% FIB of $9,734 would limit any upside.\n\nFailure to move through to $9,470 levels could see Bitcoin slide deeper into the red.\n\nA fall through to sub-$9,000 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $8.461.87 into play.\n\nBarring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$8,000 support levels.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "It\u2019s a bearish start to the day after a mixed Saturday.
