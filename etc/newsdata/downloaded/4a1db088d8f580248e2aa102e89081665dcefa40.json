A Look at the Charts More\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWith the broader market holding up, Apple stock price has a better chance of continuing higher.\n\nAs well, with trade talks between the U.S. and China making some progress, investors have to be careful for how it could impact stocks. Negative developments between the two sides will almost surely hurt the market. Given how these talks have progressed in the past, it\u2019s possible they don\u2019t work out well.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple\u2019s Particular China Pain\n\nFor Apple stock, the trade wars have been extra frustrating. Forget for a moment that Apple does considerable business in both countries and has production in China. When Apple reported earnings in late April and late July, both reports beat expectations. Guidance was better than expected and investors cheered the results.\n\nThen the trade war escalated and Apple\u2019s post-earnings gains suddenly disappeared. It doesn\u2019t take long to realize that, despite two great quarters, Apple stock hadn\u2019t really gone anywhere as early September approached.\n\nNow though, shares are starting to move higher and if momentum continues, more new highs could be on the way.\n\nTrading Apple Stock\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\n\n\nchart of Apple stock More\n\nBefore we looked at the charts, I wanted to get that bit on the trade-war front covered. That\u2019s because those events have set up an important mark on the daily chart above. Check out the two purple arrows above, both highlighting how Apple failed to hold the $215 mark on each occasions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stock was finally able to breakout over this mark in September, but more importantly, it held as support. That test came about a month later after AAPL stock fell to $215.13 before reversing higher and closing above the 50-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line).\n\nBulls have since seen AAPL stock press even higher, now north of $230. That put it above its former adjusted high of $229.92. Many charts, such as the one above, operate on a dividend-adjusted basis. In that sense, Apple stock had a high of $229.90 coming into the month.\n\nOn an unadjusted basis, the stock\u2019s high sat up near $233.40. That becomes the next upside target, while a run into the low-$240s up to channel resistance is possible beyond that.\n\nOn the downside, investors need to watch for a pullback down to channel support and the 20-day moving average. Below that puts the 50-day moving average on the table, with another possible test of $215 below that.\n\nTechnically speaking, the charts look great for Apple stock. If the broader market can stay afloat this quarter, AAPL may forge even higher going into year-end. Also, iPhone demand appears strong and sentiment is turning bullish.\n\nMost importantly though, the price action remains bullish. Even amid the volatility over the last few months, Apple has been a leader. Given its size and relevance, that\u2019s an important development in this environment.\n\nBottom Line on AAPL Stock\n\nWhen mega-cap tech names like AAPL stock, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and others are holding up in the face of market-wide volatility, it sends a sign to investors that perhaps they can be viewed as beacons of stability.\n\nThat theory doesn\u2019t always hold water, but it provides clues to the stock\u2019s price action. In the case of the Apple stock price, its reversal earlier this month off the breakout level \u2014 which was highlighted in InvestorPlace\u2019s Top Stock Trades \u2014 was a great opportunity for investors to get long.", "description": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares spent last week hitting new highs, but not in the explosively bullish way many investors were hoping.
