That is a blow to First Nations people. He has to explain that\u201d.\n\nBurney agreed, saying the voice was a very modest request.\n\n\u201cThe request from this place in 2017 is asking for an advisory voice to the parliament. Nothing about veto rights or a third chamber, it\u2019s simply an advisory group that parliament will have responsibility for designing and agreeing to. That\u2019s a modest request and I\u2019m not sure why the PM doesn\u2019t see this as a nation-building exercise. It would be an incredible legacy that he seems to not understand.\u201d\n\nBurney said the fact Liberal MP Andrew Laming \u201cwas among the last people to climb the rock, well doesn\u2019t that tell you something\u201d.\n\nDodson called on Morrison to see the Uluru Statement of the Heart and the push for constitutional recognition as a \u201cspiritual matter\u201d.\n\nNew dawn for Uluru as climb closure ends decades of disrespect Read more\n\n\u201cThe best thing that could happen is that the PM has some divine insight, some epiphany\u201d to understand the spiritual significance of Uluru.\n\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t get that I\u2019m afraid his belief system has some trouble acknowledging other belief systems.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Traditional owners of Uluru gather around the base of the climb after it was permanently closed on Friday. Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian\n\nDodson said Morrison\u2019s absence from Sunday night\u2019s historic event was \u201cmore than an insult\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister of Australia should be here at Uluru to witness the ceremony and to celebrate with people the significance of the event and compliment the Anangu people on their generosity in sharing this place.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got serious customary law leaders from across this part of the country and further afield. These are people who, when the Barunga statement was delivered to Hawke ... we danced for the PM then with these people here. And these are the same ceremonial bosses who are responsible for this dance ground and this law.\n\n\u201c[Uluru] is not some little plaything. This is a serious part of customary practice and culture for Aboriginal people.\n\n\u201cBy the leader of our nation not being here to respect our culture and to finally respect the wishes of those old people who did not want anyone climbing the rock and complimenting them on what they have done to accommodate them is more than an insult. It\u2019s an indication of the shallowness of the prime minister.\u201d", "description": "Exclusive: Labor senator Pat Dodson says PM\u2019s failure to show up to climb closure celebrations demonstrates his \u2018shallowness\u2019", "authors": ["Lorena Allam", "Mike Bowers"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/523d3065b63c783fad803293acf2ac5c02b53e02/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f10add834fc5b269135aa3ebee12ba7c", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
