But Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett said it will be hundreds of good-paying white-collar jobs.\n\nBarrett, at a City Hall news conference following the company's announcement, said his administration and Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. officials have been working Molson Coors Brewing Co., the corporate parent of MillerCoors, on plans to move jobs to Milwaukee.\n\nKroger:Grocer lifts ban on Visa credit cards at Smith's and Food Co. stores\n\nNew phase, new name\n\nThe move will grow a workforce that has its roots in Miller Brewing Co., even as the MillerCoors name is dropped.\n\nMillerCoors will now be known as Molson Coors Beverage Co.\n\nMiller Brewing was founded in Milwaukee in 1855, and was sold in 1970 to cigarette maker Philip Morris Cos. It was acquired by South African Breweries in 2002, before being merged with Coors Brewing Co. to form the MillerCoors joint venture in 2008.\n\nMillerCoors, in turn, is owned by Molson Coors, which has a joint headquarters in Denver and Montreal.\n\nSick of seeing Christmas decorations before Halloween:Blame 40% of America\n\nJobs cuts on the way\n\nThe job shift to Milwaukee is tied to a Molson Coors plan to simplify its corporate structure and cut costs.\n\nThe company will move from a corporate center and four business units to two business units: one for North America and one for Europe.\n\nThe North America business unit will consolidate the U.S. and Canada units and corporate center, the company said, allowing to it maneuver faster with its large brand lineup.\n\nMolson Coors will close its Denver office, with the MillerCoors Chicago office becoming the North American operational headquarters.\n\nAs a result, support jobs housed in several offices around the country will now be based in Milwaukee, the company said.\n\nWhile there will be a gain for Milwaukee, the consolidation will result in the loss of 400 to 500 employees throughout Molson Coors.\n\nThe company has about 610 corporate jobs and about 750 brewery jobs in Milwaukee, said Marty Maloney, manager of media relations.\n\nThe new positions should arrive in Milwaukee by July, he said.\n\nFord recalls nearly 300,000 vehicles in the US:Here's what you need to know\n\nMiller Lite still on tap\n\nWhile the MilerCoors name is being dropped, the Miller Brewing heritage will live on through such company brands as Miller Lite and Miller High Life, Maloney said.\n\nThe consolidation plan was announced as Molson Coors reported its third quarter earnings, which included revenue and income declines.\n\nThe restructuring and consolidation is designed to save $150 million that the company can reinvest in its business, which has been challenged by slowing growth and the growing number of craft beers.\n\n\"We can continue down the path we\u2019ve been on for several years now, or we can make the significant and difficult changes necessary to get back on the right track,\u201d said Gavin Hattersley, Molson Coors' chief executive officer.\n\nThe company's brands include Coors Light, Molson Canadian and Milwaukee's Best.\n\nFollow Tom Daykin on Twitter: @TomDaykin\n\nPersonal finance:This is how much the average American saves each year", "description": "Molson Coors will close its Denver office, with the MillerCoors Chicago office becoming the North American operational headquarters.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/18/PMJS/6d70a3f4-5cda-4fe9-a9a3-4b6e263f6580-2014_MJS_MILLER_04724_De_Sisti_sisti.JPG?crop=3249,1828,x0,y109&width=2888&height=1828&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
