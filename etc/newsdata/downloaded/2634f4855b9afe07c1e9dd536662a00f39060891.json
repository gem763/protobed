They undoubtedly advertise more in those places where they sell more cars. Does that mean that the car companies are responsible for additional accidents in those places? That they are purposefully plotting to create more accidents?\n\nLet\u2019s hope not, but if Monday\u2019s $570 million verdict by an Oklahoma judge against Johnson & Johnson for making opioids is any indication, those types of cases aren\u2019t going to be far off. Oklahoma had refused to settle out of court believing that they could receive a very large verdict. And the actual verdict is much larger than it might appear as it just represents the penalty for damages from a single year.\n\nThe state of Oklahoma claimed Johnson & Johnson and other pharmaceutical companies spent tens of millions of dollars annually in direct-to-physician marketing of opioids and that as opioid sales grew, so did addiction and overdoses.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the message to other states: We did it in Oklahoma. You can do it elsewhere,\u201d Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter said on Monday. He said that their case provided a \u201croad map\u201d for other states to follow in holding drugmakers responsible for the deaths and addiction created by the drugs.\n\nExhibit 1 for Oklahoma\u2019s case has been a set of studies like one in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The authors claimed they found an \u201cassociation between pharmaceutical company marketing of opioids to physicians and deaths from prescription opioid overdoses, we found that counties receiving such marketing subsequently experienced elevated mortality. In addition, opioid prescribing rates were strongly associated with the burden of opioid marketing across counties and partly mediated the association between marketing and deaths from opioid overdoses.\u201d\n\nOne wonders why such a study was needed, but, as usual, the public health researchers grossly misinterpreted their results. More drug use means more people get addicted, but that doesn\u2019t mean they have done something wrong. The drugs also made life livable for a lot of people.\n\nIf you think that this is an idea that you have heard about before, you probably have. About 20 years ago this \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d theory was tried in lawsuits by cities against gun makers. The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act stopped many cities from simultaneously bringing these suits and bankrupting the gun makers. The law doesn\u2019t protect the gun makers from making faulty products or from lying to customers or if they break the law.\n\nThis claim is no different than the car example mentioned earlier. This applies to other cases. More surgeries are more likely to result in more malpractice claims and deaths from those surgeries. Presumably, also the more doctors recommend surgery to their patients (read \u201cmarketing\u201d) the more people will have surgery and the more malpractice cases there will be.\n\nHere is one example litigious lawyers might appreciate. More lawyers mean more legal cases and more malpractice cases by lawyers. Should we then sue law schools for producing more lawyers?\n\nWith every product, the more that it is used, the number of problems that will arise will be greater. That is true even if the rate of problems is very low.\n\nAccording to Oklahoma, Johnson & Johnson marketed the drugs irresponsibly. \u201cMany studies show that opioids are rarely addictive when used properly for the management of chronic pain,\u201d was a claim in one of the company\u2019s marketing materials.\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone uses the drugs properly. Just like not everyone drives their car correctly and not all lawyers or doctors practice their professions correctly, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s statement was exactly right. Having people abuse a drug is no different than people driving too fast. According to the National Institute of Drug Abuse, around 8 to 12 percent misuse opioids and develop an opioid use disorder, with as many as 6 percent transitioning to other drugs such as heroin.\n\nThe problem is the cases brought by Oklahoma and numerous other states will be used to create new precedents that will allow cases to be brought against all sorts of other companies. It looks like it is about time that we pass a Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act for all other companies.\n\n* Lott is the president of the Crime Prevention Research Center and the author most recently of \u201cThe War on Guns.\u201d", "description": "When General Motors and Ford sell more cars, they are .09/02/2019 3:26:20AM EST.", "authors": ["John R.
