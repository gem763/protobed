If you don\u2019t have allergies, there\u2019s always the risk of a troublesome spring or summer cold. But, no matter which affliction your respiratory system ends up doing battle with, you\u2019re going to have to deal with mucus.\n\nMucus definitely has the \u201cyuck\u201d factor, but it\u2019s way more beneficial than most people realize. Mucus actually plays an important role in keeping us healthy by serving as our first line of defense against pathogens.\n\nMucus-producing tissues line the nose, mouth, throat, sinuses, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. Mucus serves as a protective barrier over these surfaces. It prevents the tissues underneath from drying out, and it traps unwanted invaders like viruses, bacteria, dust, allergens, etc., so that they can\u2019t get into your body.\n\nNormally, we aren\u2019t bothered by our body\u2019s normal production of mucus. In fact, we barely even notice it\u2026that is, until one wayward virus, bacterium, or other pathogen makes it past the mucus membrane and we end up sick.\n\nWhen illness strikes\u2014or when allergies or conditions such as acid reflux flare up\u2014mucus becomes much more noticeable. Not only can these health issues throw the body\u2019s mucus production into overdrive; they can cause a change in its consistency, making it thicker, stickier, sometimes runnier, and all-around annoying.\n\nIn most cases, the overproduction of mucus isn\u2019t problematic and it\u2019s best to let the body fight the bug or allergy off on its own. But if too much mucus is making life especially difficult, there are several drug-free, natural things you can try at home to thin out, loosen up, and \u201cunload\u201d the mucus.\n\nSteam/Humidifier\n\nMoist, humid air can help release mucus and clear up congestion. There are several ways to increase humidity. Probably the easiest is to use a cool mist humidifier, which you can leave on safely all day long. (To avoid mold and mildew buildup, follow instructions for proper cleaning.)\n\nYou can also turn your bathroom into a steamy sauna by running the hot water in the shower for a while, then stepping into the room. If you prefer not to waste water though, you can get the same effect by filling a large bowl with very hot water, leaning over the bowl, covering your head and the bowl with a towel to trap the steam, and breathing deeply through your nose.\n\nGargle\n\nGargling warm salt water can help clear out any mucus that\u2019s in the back of your throat. Simply dissolve \u00bd teaspoon of salt in one cup of warm filtered/distilled water. Take a sip, tilt your head back, gargle for 10\u201320 seconds (or as long as you can), then spit it out. Repeat as necessary.\n\nNasal Irrigation\n\nNasal irrigation using a saltwater rinse is an excellent way to remove mucus and any particles from your sinuses.\n\nTo make the rinse, mix eight ounces of warm distilled water (never use tap water!) with \u00bc teaspoon of salt. Fill a bulb syringe or neti pot with the saltwater solution. Lean over the sink, tilt your head to one side, and gently insert the tip of the pot or syringe into your upper nostril.\n\nSqueeze or pour the solution into your upper nostril and allow it to drain out of your lower nostril. Repeat on the other side, then blow your nose to fully clear your sinuses.\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\nDon\u2019t forget to clean your syringe or neti pot after use.\n\nEssential Oils\n\nCertain essential oils can help to thin mucus so it can be more easily eliminated. Peppermint and eucalyptus are the most effective for this purpose.\n\nYou can use essential oils a few different ways. You can diffuse it into the air using an inexpensive diffuser.\n\nYou can add a couple drops into a hot bath, or apply it topically by mixing a drop or two with about 10\u201312 drops of a carrier oil like jojoba or coconut oil. If using a particular essential oil for the first time, apply the mixture to the inside of your forearm to make sure you don\u2019t have a reaction from it. If you can tolerate it with no issue, apply it to your chest and breathe it in deeply to achieve the full therapeutic effect.\n\nOf course, the old drugstore standby, Vicks VapoRub, contains eucalyptus. So, if you don\u2019t have or use essential oils, head over to your nearest pharmacy and pick up this inexpensive, century-old remedy. Use as directed.\n\n\u201cExpectorant\u201d Foods\n\nBelieve it or not, certain foods have the power to thin and dry out excess mucus.\n\nGinger has been used for centuries as a natural decongestant, antiviral, and antibacterial. To use it for this purpose, steep a tablespoon of freshly cut ginger slices in hot water, and drink several times a day. Or you can simply chew on raw ginger throughout the day.\n\nCayenne pepper is another option that helps, thanks to its active ingredient called capsaicin\u2014the compound that gives peppers their heat. You can mix a quarter teaspoon of cayenne pepper in fresh ginger tea (above) to multiply the mucus-loosening effect.\n\nGarlic is also a natural expectorant that has anti-microbial properties to fight off viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens that enter the respiratory tract and cause excess mucus in the first place.\n\nFinally, honey has wonderful soothing properties and has actually been found in some studies to ease cough more effectively than over-the-counter expectorants.1 Use it in tea, or swallow a spoonful as needed throughout the day. (Note: Babies should not be given honey.)\n\nOccasionally, excess mucus production may indicate a more serious problem, especially if it is severe, persistent, comes with fever or muscle aches, and doesn\u2019t improve with self-care. In that case, see your doctor. Otherwise, these home remedies\u2014and a little bit of patience\u2014should help. Give them a try!\n\nDid You Enjoy This Article?
