Photo: HBO\n\nOn TV, as in real life, Halloween is a time for candy, scares, and, most importantly, dressing up. But there comes a point when costumes evolve from a candy-grabbing incentive to a provocative statement \u2014 or, in the words of Mean Girls\u2019 spot-on summation of this annual event, \u201cHalloween is the one day a year when a girl can dress up like a total slut and no other girls can say anything else about it.\u201d\n\nTelevision youths have long reckoned with the dilemma of how to celebrate a holiday that underscores the tension between childhood and adulthood, a time when one overindulging ritual is replaced by another kind of socialized excess. Twenty years have passed since Freaks and Geeks delivered what is still the best depiction of this conflict between the warm fantasy of childhood Halloween and the rush to grow up; nothing is purer than Bill Haverchuck going through his mom\u2019s closet, trying to figure out what the Bionic Woman would wear. More recently, in the second season of Stranger Things, our preteen heroes turning up to middle school on October 31 dressed as the Ghostbusters when none of the other kids are in costume turns what might once have been a social slam dunk into an embarrassment. For teens, on TV or otherwise, ghosts aren\u2019t the scariest thing about Halloween \u2014 being a laughingstock is.\n\nExplorations of identity are at their most potent during adolescence, and Halloween is the perfect excuse to experiment with the person you long to be. Halloween episodes present a unique opportunity for our favorite fictional adolescents to indulge in costume fun while also addressing these kinds of wider themes. So, in honor of this annual rite of costumed passage, here are the five types of costumes you will find the TV youths wearing.\n\nProvocative\n\nPhoto: HBO\n\nBuffy Summers referred to this night as \u201ccome as you aren\u2019t\u201d in a bid to unleash Willow\u2019s inner wild child on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but the horny teens of Elite and Euphoria need no such encouragement. But even if they don\u2019t require Halloween to booze up a storm, they still make a special effort with their choice of eyebrow-raising attire, taking the Mean Girls slutty mandate to new and inappropriate heights. Though Euphoria\u2019s Maddy idolizes Sharon Stone in Casino, she ends up opting for a more disturbing choice of Scorsese character; her outfit seems cute until you realize she is imitating Jodie Foster as an underage prostitute in Taxi Driver. Meanwhile, Daniel\u2019s take on Ted Bundy is indicative of a teen boy wishing his peers thought he was edgy, when he is anything but.\n\nThe rich murder teens on Elite also indulge in the \u201cmake it sexy\u201d aesthetic. However, it is Polo and Cayetana who enter bad-taste territory with their blood-splattered depiction of the JFK assassination. (Maybe Cayetana is a big fan of Natalie Portman\u2019s best work?) Sexy costumes, particularly those rooted in a real-life pop-cultural figure or moment, have a way of aging badly (or were never a good idea to begin with), as further evidenced by Haley\u2019s \u201cSexy Mother Theresa\u201d in season two of Modern Family. Just like Fred Rogers and Handmaids, Mother Theresa should probably be exempt from the Girl World \u201ctotal slut\u201d rule.\n\nPop-Culture Nostalgia\n\nPhoto: Jessica Brooks/ABC\n\nOn the other hand, Euphoria\u2019s Halloween outing also illustrated that pop-culture nostalgia, sexy or otherwise, can make for an easy costume win, showcasing iconic looks from \u201990s movie classics like Romeo + Juliet and True Romance. References like these aren\u2019t a huge stretch for Gen Z, but they do have a strong whiff of what was cool when Millennial creator Sam Levinson was growing up. Nonetheless, picking timeless characters ensures an episode cannot be instantly dated. Hanna from Pretty Little Liars ticks this box, leaning into iconic moments in pop music (Britney Spears) and movies (Marilyn Monroe\u2019s The Seven Year Itch), while Emily pulls off cult classic Barbarella. On Glee, Halloween is an excuse to indulge in the Rocky Horror Picture Show, while Speechless turned back the clock with a Back to the Future group theme, transforming J.J\u2019s wheelchair into the DeLorean. The DiMeo family had previously dressed in Titanic, Star Wars, and Aladdin group costumes, but this episode marks the first year in which J.J. doesn\u2019t want to indulge in tradition; he wants to go to an actual high-school party instead. The conflict here, as on Freaks and Geeks, is parents clinging to the kid version of Halloween, and what represents that tension more succinctly than a throwback costume?\n\nCurrent Affairs\n\nPhoto: Twentieth Century Fox\n\nAs with pop culture, there is nothing quite like the news to turn a costume into a timestamp. The Huangs on Fresh Off the Boat have nailed movie and TV references from the \u201990s period in which the show is set \u2014 including an incredible Silence of the Lambs team-up costume \u2014 but young Evan and Emery up their game the following year with their interpretation of the trial of the decade. Dressing up as Judge Ito and Kato Kaelin (complete with a McDonald\u2019s bag) cements their status as bona fide Halloween-costume experts. The teens of Euphoria could only dream of a \u201990s reference like this.\n\nFor a family costume that isn\u2019t mired in controversy, the Black-ish First Family group effort \u2014 which includes Miles as First Dog Bo \u2014 will make you wistful for the recent past. Halloween is meant to be scary, but there is nothing more terrifying than the current political climate.\n\nBasic\n\nPhoto: The CW\n\nConsidering the number of extravagant parties Gossip Girl hosted over the years, the series\u2019 one and only Halloween episode is a bit of a letdown. Instead of a regular \u201ccome as you aren\u2019t\u201d affair, the party\u2019s 1920s flapper theme results in a costume snoozefest consisting of otherwise beautiful frocks that Serena and Blair would probably wear in any other episode. Teens of the aughts also let us down on One Tree Hill, which saw Peyton dressed as a sexy Angel of Death and Brooke as a sexy Devil \u2014 in case you were doubting the Mean Girls Halloween observation.\n\nMinimal Effort\n\nPhoto: Twentieth Century Fox\n\nThere\u2019s always one person who turns up in their regular attire with just a hint of something festive. Oz took the \u201cWhat If God Was One Of Us\u201d approach in season four of Buffy by wearing a \u201cHello, My Name Is\u201d sticker bearing the name of the almighty. Meanwhile, Ethan added a dash of fake blood to his face on Euphoria as part of his \u201cstreet vampire\u201d look. Is this approach inherently charming or incredibly lazy? It helps that both Ethan and Oz are unassuming (and cute) so it doesn\u2019t read as obnoxious.\n\nNoel Crane on Felicity also falls into the nerdy/cute column, acquiring Subway uniforms for last-minute costumes that save him from Elena\u2019s wrath. Despite the anti-sexy vibes, Elena still manages to hookup with a Tin Man at the party, so it isn\u2019t a total bust. Noel, meanwhile, finds a use for his Sandwich-Artist plastic gloves when a drunk Felicity throws up in his lap.
