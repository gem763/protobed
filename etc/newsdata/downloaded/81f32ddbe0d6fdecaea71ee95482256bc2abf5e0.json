It May Get Worse", "language": "en", "text": "(Bloomberg) -- NIO Inc. investors looking for a reprieve after the stock\u2019s worst week ever are waking up to more bad news: Sanford C. Bernstein just slashed its estimate for the Chinese electric-vehicle maker to almost 50% below the current price.\n\nBernstein analysts led by Robin Zhu cut their price target to 90 cents from $1.70 -- the first to go below $1, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The EV maker has lost more than 70% of its market capitalization, or close to $5 billion, since its New York initial public offering a year ago. The shares fell 42% last week alone to close at $1.75 on Friday.\n\nNow valued at just $1.8 billion, NIO embodies the challenges faced by China\u2019s electric-car aspirants. The country\u2019s highest-profile EV startup and the first to go public, NIO is \u201csymbolically important,\u201d Bernstein said. A failure would represent \u201can embarrassing setback for China\u2019s EV ambitions,\u201d damaging other local contenders\u2019 fund-raising plans, the analysts said.\n\nNIO last week posted a worse-than-expected second-quarter loss because of sputtering demand, rising costs and intensifying competition. Even with fresh money set to be raised from Chief Executive Officer William Li and shareholder Tencent Holdings Ltd., NIO may only have enough cash to stay afloat for weeks, according to Bernstein.\n\nTo fuel sales, NIO announced a plan to open 200 pop-up stores in more than 100 Chinese cities. Bernstein analysts are \u201cskeptical\u201d about the campaign\u2019s chances of success, as the effort is costly and may fail to generate EV demand outside the 15-20 biggest cities.\n\nNIO\u2019s main options now are insolvency or a bailout by the Chinese government or another suitor, according to Bernstein. Still, a deal with the government could be difficult, as an investment in a bleeding company in such a capital-intensive industry might be viewed as a \u201cmisappropriation of state funds,\u201d Zhu said by phone.\n\nTo contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Chunying Zhang in Shanghai at czhang714@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Young-Sam Cho at ycho2@bloomberg.net, Ville Heiskanen, Angus Whitley\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- NIO Inc. investors looking for a reprieve after the stock\u2019s worst week ever are waking up to more bad news: Sanford C.
