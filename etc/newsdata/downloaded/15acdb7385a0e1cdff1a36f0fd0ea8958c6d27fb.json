The exact location isn\u2019t specified, but all you need to know is that it\u2019s exactly the sort of place a person might stay away from if they didn\u2019t want to be murdered.\n\nIntersecting this story is the workplace comedy of two middle-aged corporates. They\u2019re in an windowless office at an undisclosed location, riffing about their big project and running the office sweepstakes.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never seen the film, then I won\u2019t spoil it for you: go and watch it on your own. And if you have seen it, then you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about when I say the middle act rips out every expectation you have of what is coming, and the third act boots your expectations out the third floor window.\n\nAlso \u2013 and I cannot stress this enough \u2013 Chris Hemsworth is there.\n\nHe plays the \u2018athlete\u2019, because of course he does. Technically his character\u2019s name is Curt (typical jock bullshit name), but for all intents and purposes he is the athlete. He\u2019s dating the \u2018whore\u2019, and yes, those are their official roles for reasons I won\u2019t spoil here. He\u2019s tall and broad-shouldered but not yet with Thor-like levels of swagger, because Thor hadn\u2019t begun filming yet.\n\nThe thing is, Cabin in the Woods is an incredible memorable film for its premise, so until a recent rewatch I completely forgot that major Hollywood star and Marvel god Chris \u2018I can lift a small car with one hand\u2019 Hemsworth is in it.\n\n2011 was an interesting time for Hemsworth. Thor came out to major box office success and mid-warm critical acclaim, helping launch the Marvel universe into the utter behemoth it has since become.\n\nMeanwhile, MGM studios was trying to shift Cabin in the Woods, after release was delayed a full year so it could be converted to 3D (a true horror) and then again due to \u201congoing financial difficulties\u201d. After a surprise screening in 2011, it finally had a box office run in 2012, making a decent $66.5 million worldwide, but a paltry compared to Thor\u2019s $449.3 million.\n\nBy the time Cabin in the Woods came out, Hemsworth\u2019s Marvel career was off \u2013 he went on to star in The Avengers (2012), Thor: The Dark World (2013), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Thor: Ragnorak (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), Avengers: Endgame (2019), and will soon be working on a fourth Thor film, Thor: Love and Thunder, slated for a 2021 release.\n\nWith the franchise monster of Marvel gobbling up every ticket sale and ounce of media attention, who would remember their Norse god also appeared in little horror flick which struggled to get off the ground? (That\u2019s right, he didn\u2019t even STAR IN IT.) Not me, and hopefully not you either \u2013 although if you want to yell at how dumb I am for not remembering this detail, the Facebook comment section is right there, buddy.\n\nMost of Hemsworth\u2019s fellow Cabin in the Woods alumni didn\u2019t exactly go on to have major Hollywood success, either: Jesse Williams (the \u2018scholar\u2019) is mostly known for his Grey\u2019s Anatomy work, Kristen Connolly (the \u2018virgin\u2019) had a recurring part I literally cannot remember in House of Cards, Anna Hutchison (the \u2018whore\u2019) is still working but in nothing I recognise, and Fran Kranz (\u2018the fool\u2019) most recently had a very small role in Amazon\u2019s Homecoming.\n\n(The same cannot be said for absolute lords Bradley Whitford and Richard Jenkins, who play the middle manager office workers, as well as a SURPRISE CAMEO I WILL ALSO NOT SPOIL. Just so we\u2019re clear.)\n\nBut Hemsworth? He has an estimate net work of $90 million, is building some fuck-off huge mansion in the Byron Bay hinterlands, is an ambassador for Tourism Australia, and could live off his Marvel movie for the rest of his life while choosing whatever other roles he damn well pleases. Or choose no roles! Maybe he just wants to surf and hang out with his wife and kids, and we should let this handsome Australian export do that.\n\nI don\u2019t really know how to finish this post except to say: go watch Cabin in the Woods if you haven\u2019t already done so, you absolute moron. And enjoy a pre-Thor Chris Hemsworth in the role it looks like he was born to roll out of bed and play.", "description": "Do you remember that Marvel movie star Chris Hemsworth once starred in Joss Whedon's cult horror classic 'The Cabin in the Woods'?
