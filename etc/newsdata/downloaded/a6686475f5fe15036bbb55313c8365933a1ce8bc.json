The White House has defended the decision to hold the summit at the Trump National Doral in Miami in recent days.\n\nOn Twitter, the president announced the decision to remove his own resort from consideration, despite stating previously that he was willing to host the summit at no profit for the resort, and possibly at no cost to the United States.\n\n.....its own 50 to 70 unit building. Would set up better than other alternatives. I announced that I would be willing to do it at NO PROFIT or, if legally permissible, at ZERO COST to the USA. But, as usual, the Hostile Media & their Democrat Partners went CRAZY! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 20, 2019\n\n....Therefore, based on both Media & Democrat Crazed and Irrational Hostility, we will no longer consider Trump National Doral, Miami, as the Host Site for the G-7 in 2020. We will begin the search for another site, including the possibility of Camp David, immediately. Thank you! \u2014 Donald J.
