It will be available for 12 weeks in 28 restaurants in Southwestern Ontario by the end of the month.\n\nThe limited test is rolling out about six months after rival Burger King began testing the plant-based Impossible burger, which no surprise, is a rival to Beyond Meat. It's now selling those burgers nationwide.\n\nMeat alternatives are being introduced across the fast food sector. KFC last month said it's testing plant-based chicken nuggets and boneless wings at an Atlanta restaurant in partnership with Beyond Meat.\n\nBefore the opening bell Thursday, shares of Beyond Meat Inc. soared 11%.", "description": "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 McDonald's is finally taking a nibble of the plant-based burger.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
