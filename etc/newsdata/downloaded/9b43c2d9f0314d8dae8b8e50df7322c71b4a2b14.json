The release surprised some on Capitol Hill, seeing as how its contents were so damning. It confirmed that Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, who the president considers to be his biggest threat in the 2020 election \u2015 which is ironic, because asking a foreign country to interfere in a U.S. election is exactly what the whole 2016 Russia imbroglio was about.\n\nBut the whistleblower complaint goes further, alleging the president and White House officials attempted to use others to cover up Trump\u2019s misdeeds.\n\nYou can see the redacted complaint for yourself here, or read on for some key takeaways.\n\nThe Trump administration tried to cover up records of the Ukrainian call.\n\nThe whistleblower, whose identity has not been made public, said that Trump \u201cused the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election\u201d in the phone call and that the complainant and administration officials were \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the behavior.\n\n\u201cSenior White House officials,\u201d according to the complaint, stepped in to \u201clock down\u201d all records of the call with the newly elected Ukrainian president. They were \u201cdirected\u201d by White House lawyers to scrub the electronic transcript from a computer system where they are typically stored and move it to a secure system used for especially sensitive classified information.\n\n\u201cThis set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call,\u201d the whistleblower wrote.\n\nSome officials worried this was an abuse of the top-secret computer system, because the call \u201cdid not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective,\u201d the complaint said. Typically, the secure system is used for \u201ccodeword-level intelligence information, such as covert action.\u201d\n\nTrump appears to have squirreled away records of calls before, in order to protect politically sensitive information.\n\nFrom the complaint: \u201cAccording to White House officials I spoke with, this was \u2018not the first time\u2019 under this Administration that a Presidential transcript was placed into this codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive \u2015 rather than national security sensitive \u2015 information.\u201d\n\nThe complaint gave no indication what those other calls might have been about, or if they might be relevant to the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThere might have been a \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d\n\nDiscussion of the Trump-Zelensky call, including whether it supports impeachment, has involved lots of speculation over whether the U.S. leader threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine if Zelensky did not acquiesce to Trump\u2019s demands.\n\nAt the bottom of an appendix to the complaint, the whistleblower wrote: \u201cAs of early August, I heard from U.S. officials that some Ukrainian officials were aware that U.S. aid might be in jeopardy, but I do not know how or when they learned of it.\u201d\n\nOtherwise the complaint barely touches on military aid. But it does suggest that a future meeting between Trump and Zelensky, which the Ukrainian leader wanted, would \u201cdepend on whether Zelensky showed willingness to \u2018play ball.\u2019\u201d\n\nRudy Giuliani and two U.S. ambassadors helped Ukraine meet Trump\u2019s demands.\n\nRudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor who is now Trump\u2019s personal attorney, engaged in a series of meetings and visits with Ukrainian officials in order to advance the president\u2019s interests, the complaint says.\n\nTwo U.S. ambassadors also tried to help Zelensky \u201cnavigate\u201d Trump\u2019s demands. According to the complaint, U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker and U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland visited Kiev the day after the call. The call summary suggests Attorney General William Barr was involved here in some way, but the whistleblower doesn\u2019t seem to know too much about that.", "description": "The complaint alleges the White House tried to cover up the president's actions.", "authors": ["Sara Boboltz"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xS.DQRTam27kotZ8tTOfPQ--~B/aD0zMjc2O3c9NDU4ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8cc52321000034005e750f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
