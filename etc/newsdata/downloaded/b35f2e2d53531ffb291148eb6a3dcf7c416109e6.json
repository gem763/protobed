Some companies could find common practices become suddenly illegal, contracts could be lost or multinationals may suddenly withdraw from the supply chain, the IFG added.\n\nBut it said ministers will have to ignore some requests for help from companies in the interest of protecting the public purse and maintaining fair competition. The report warns that challenging conditions in the wake of a no-deal could last for an indefinite period, meaning the government could put itself at risk of an \u201copen-ended, financially ruinous commitment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith a no-deal Brexit, the government would be pursuing a policy that its own analysis suggests will be very damaging to business,\u201d said Giles Wilkes, a senior fellow at the IFG. \u201cIt is understandable that they want to play Santa and help UK plc over the \u2018bumps in the road\u2019. But faced with so many other calls on the public purse and with little idea of the medium-term direction of the economy, they will have to prepare to play Scrooge instead.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cBadly spent money might do more harm than good, propping up unviable companies and hurting competition.\u201d\n\nThe report concluded: \u201cThe distinction between a company damaged specifically by no-deal Brexit, and one simply suffering the rigours of free-market competition, will not always be obvious. Government has to draw a line around its support, but where that should be is impossible to say.\u201d\n\nA government spokesperson said: \"The U.K. is getting ready for Brexit on 31 October. We want a deal, but we must be prepared for every eventuality.\n\n\u201cThe whole of government is working tirelessly to ensure that the country is prepared to leave the EU on 31 October and has significantly accelerated efforts over the past months.\u201d", "description": "The Institute for Government said ministers might have to \u2018play Scrooge\u2019 instead.", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1071833052-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
