Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images\n\nOn the heels of getting caught inventing an anecdote about a service member in Afghanistan, in an attempt to make the point that the United States needs to bring its troops back home, Joe Biden has now made some interesting claims about his role in sending troops away from home in the first place. This is from NPR:\n\n[Biden] explained that his rationale in authorizing the use of military force in Iraq in 2002 was based on a commitment he had received from then-President George W. Bush that he would not go to war in Iraq. \u201c[Bush] looked me in the eye in the Oval Office. He said he needed the vote to be able to get inspectors into Iraq to determine whether or not Saddam Hussein was engaged in dealing with a nuclear program,\u201d said Biden. \u201cHe got them in and before you know it, we had \u2018shock and awe.\u2019 \u201d \u2026 \u201cImmediately, that moment it started, I came out against the war at that moment,\u201d Biden told NPR.\n\nThis version of events is so twisted that the very next sentence of the NPR story starts debunking the idea that Biden was antiwar. But it\u2019s worth unpacking more fully. Let\u2019s start from the beginning and work our way through:\n\n\u2022 Biden voted to pass the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution on Oct. 11, 2002.* Though Biden now tells NPR that this was an intermediate step and that he had not expected it to lead directly to war, the possibility of invading Iraq to instigate \u201cregime change\u201d was explicitly under discussion at the time. In fact, the first article I found in a Nexis search for newspaper articles that included the words \u201cregime change\u201d in the months before the vote was an Aug. 1, 2002, New York Times piece that begins with the words, \u201cIn the first public hearings on the administration\u2019s goal of ousting Saddam Hussein from the Iraqi presidency, an array of experts warned a Senate committee today that an invasion of Iraq would carry significant risks.\u201d The chairman of that Senate committee was Joe Biden.\n\n\u2022 Later in August, Dick Cheney gave a speech in which he announced that the U.S. would be justified in preemptively attacking Iraq in order to depose Hussein. In that speech, Cheney explicitly rejected the idea \u201cthat we should just get inspectors back into Iraq, and then our worries will be over.\u201d A September Times article about Iraq stated matter-of-factly that \u201cthe Bush administration has been drawing up plans for an invasion.\u201d\n\n\u2022 United Nations and International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors did, in fact, enter Iraq that November. But contra Biden\u2019s assertion that Bush then invaded the country immediately, the resumption of inspections actually set off a months-long diplomatic process that culminated in a standoff at the U.N. between the U.S.\u2019 small alliance, which argued that Iraq had failed to cooperate with the inspectors and was developing weapons of mass destruction in a way that justified the use of force, and a France/Russia group, which opposed the prospective invasion and held that there was no evidence that Iraqi WMDs existed. During this period, on March 10, 2003, Biden published a Washington Post op-ed in which he said that he disagreed with elements of the Bush administration\u2019s posture at the U.N.\u2014but also that he supported the goal of regime change, believed that \u201cSaddam Hussein is relentlessly pursuing weapons of mass destruction,\u201d agreed with Bush that Iraq was not adequately cooperating with inspections, and declared that he would support a military invasion of the country as early as the end of the month if it did not meet a to-be-determined set of disarmament goals. In other words, his position at the time\u2014though it was indeed a masterpiece of trying to play every angle at once\u2014was not that the mere achievement of nuclear inspections in Iraq should be the end goal of U.S. policy.\n\n\u2022 Bush decided to abandon the U.N. process and invaded Iraq on March 19. U.S. forces, of course, never discovered weapons of mass destruction in the country or evidence that Hussein\u2019s regime was developing any. As NPR notes, Biden nonetheless gave a speech in July 2003 in which he said he had made the right choice to vote for the October 2002 AUMF and that he \u201cwould vote that way again today\u201d if given the chance\u2014remarks that undermine his current claim that he\u2019d known at the moment of invasion that Bush had hoodwinked him by promising that he wouldn\u2019t ever actually go to war (which, again, is an implausible claim).\n\nUnderlying all of that is the absurdity, when two of the premises of your presidential campaign are that you have good foreign policy judgment and that you are an expert at working with Republicans in bipartisan good faith, of telling a story about how you made a disastrous foreign policy decision because a Republican took advantage of your na\u00efve belief that he was working in bipartisan good faith.\n\nSo \u2026 given that it\u2019s extremely at odds with both the public record and the themes of his campaign, why is Biden claiming that George W. Bush fooled him into accidentally voting to start a war? Probably because the most central theme of his campaign, and indeed the theme of his entire career, is that Joe Biden represents the common-sense majority consensus of the American public against extremists on both sides. In 2002 and 2003, a wide majority of Americans felt that Bush was a good president and that invading Iraq was a good idea, and thus Joe Biden for the most part felt that way too. In 2019, though, those positions are, at best, contested ones, and thus Joe Biden no longer holds them either. If you look at a chart of George W. Bush\u2019s approval rating, in fact, you\u2019ll find that he went underwater for good in the second half of 2005, and, well, let\u2019s see here:\n\nIt was a mistake. It was a mistake to assume the president would use the authority we gave him properly. \u2026 I\u2014with this president, absolutely I would vote no, based on the way in which they\u2019ve handled it.\n\nThat would be Joe Biden, in November 2005, on Meet the Press, disavowing his AUMF vote. Right on time.\n\nCorrection, Sept. 4, 2019: This post initially misstated the year that the Iraq AUMF was passed.
