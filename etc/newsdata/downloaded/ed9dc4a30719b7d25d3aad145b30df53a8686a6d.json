The first is the keyboard, which is a joy to type on and yet incredibly quiet. The second is the battery life, which is as good or better than any Intel laptop I\u2019ve used in recent memory.\n\nThose are the great things, but there are plenty of good things, too. It has a simple, unfussy design, good speakers, and a solid trackpad. The model I am testing, which has an Intel Core i5 Y-series processor, is fast and responsive. Virtually everything about this laptop makes me want to recommend it as the go-to, default Chromebook for everybody.\n\nEverything, that is, except for the price. It starts at $649 and the model I\u2019m testing is $849. Comparable Chromebooks cost at least a hundred bucks less for similar features. So with the Pixelbook Go, what are you paying for?\n\nSimplicity.\n\nOur review of Google Pixelbook Go Verge Score 7.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Excellent keyboard\n\nGood battery life\n\nSimple, clean design Bad Stuff Expensive compared to competition\n\nNo microSD storage expansion\n\n16:9 screen can feel cramped Buy for $649.00 from Google Store\n\nThe Pixelbook Go is a handsome 13.3-inch laptop with an understated, clean design. Or at least, the black model I am using is understated \u2014 it will also eventually be offered in a color Google calls \u201cNot Pink,\u201d that has a soft pink finish with a bright, coral base. It\u2019s not hugely different looking from a MacBook Pro, if you could get one of those in black.\n\nIt weighs 2.3 pounds and feels sturdy and trustworthy thanks to a magnesium chassis. Many Chromebooks have plastic bodies, so part of what you\u2019re paying for with the Pixelbook Go is the materials. Google has coated that magnesium with a soft paint that\u2019s almost plastic-like. I can\u2019t tell you if it will chip or scratch easily \u2014 it hasn\u2019t during my week of testing, at least \u2014 but I suspect it\u2019ll hold up fairly well.\n\nThe whole thing is gently curved around the edges, and if it weren\u2019t so well-made I would say it\u2019s prototype-y in the way Google hardware used to be. The most notable design element is the bottom, which is ridged for grip. The keyboard is backlit and flanked by two speakers that are respectable, if not impressive for a laptop of this size.\n\nAgree to continue: Pixelbook Go Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate. To use the Pixelbook Go, you must agree to: Chrome OS terms (includes Google\u2019s privacy policy)\n\nChrome Sync\n\nPersonalized Google services (includes ad targeting, can be disabled later)\n\nGoogle Play Apps and Services terms. The following agreements are optional: Send usage and diagnostic data Other features like the Google Assistant may require additional agreements. Final tally: four mandatory agreements and one or more optional agreements\n\nI mentioned in our first look at the Go that I needed to make sure I didn\u2019t get too excited about the keyboard without further testing. Now that I have, I can just say that I love it. It is my favorite thing to type on by a long shot.\n\nGoogle took the already excellent Pixelbook keyboard and iterated on it a bit, making the keys slightly quieter. I\u2019ve tried keyboards that aim for silence in the past and they usually end up feeling mushy, but that\u2019s not the case here at all. The keys have good travel and a good amount of springy resistance. If you like clacky mechanical keyboards, this isn\u2019t for you.\n\nThe trackpad underneath the keyboard is large, but not massive. Google has done a good job with palm rejection on it, too. Unlike the Pixelbook, the trackpad on the Go doesn\u2019t extend all the way to the bottom lip of the keyboard deck, so it\u2019s less prone to mis-clicks.\n\nUnfortunately, the Pixelbook Go doesn\u2019t have any kind of biometric authentication like a fingerprint sensor or face unlock. Google points out that you can pair it with an Android phone and use that phone\u2019s biometrics to unlock the laptop. Same applies for the lack of LTE options \u2014 it\u2019s easy to tether to your Pixel phone directly from the system menu.\n\nYou can lift up the screen with just one finger, but you can\u2019t flip it all the way around to put the laptop into tablet or tent mode. As bad as tablet mode on Chrome OS still is, I do wish it was still an option here, if only for setting it up in a tent mode to watch movies on a plane.\n\nThree of the four Pixelbook Go models come with a 1920 x 1080, 16:9 LCD touchscreen. The bezels on the top and bottom of the screen are on the large side, but the screen itself gets plenty bright and doesn\u2019t inspire any complaints. Really, my only problem is with that aspect ratio: I\u2019m not a fan. I know not everybody likes the taller 3:2 aspect ratio on laptops, but even 16:10 would have felt a little less cramped when I\u2019m browsing websites.\n\nAll Pixelbook Go models are fanless because all of them use Intel Y-series chips. In fact, Google is using 8th Gen Intel chips instead of something newer. That\u2019s partially a cost saving measure, I suppose, but the truth is I didn\u2019t notice any real problems with speed. I\u2019m testing the mid-range model with the Core i5 and 8GB of RAM and have yet to encounter any real slowdowns.\n\nBattery life is also excellent. I haven\u2019t quite reached Google\u2019s claimed 12 hours of use, but I haven\u2019t had any problems getting through a full eight-hour workday. The Pixelbook Go also supports fast charging over either USB-C port, and in my test I brought it up from zero to 35 percent in 30 minutes. (Chrome OS still has some kinks to work out, by the way: its time remaining estimate was consistently wrong.) The USB-C ports also handle the usual USB stuff, including video out, but they don\u2019t support Thunderbolt 3.\n\nOne of the reasons that the Pixelbook Go runs so well is that Google has simply tried to do less with it than it did with last year\u2019s Pixel Slate tablet. That device performed and sold so poorly that Google ultimately scrapped its plans to make more Chrome OS-based tablets and just made this simple laptop instead.\n\nPixelbook Go specs Processor: 8th Gen Intel Core m3, i5, or i7\n\nRAM: 8GB / 16GB of RAM\n\nStorage: 64GB / 128GB / 256GB SSD\n\nWeight: 2.3 pounds (FHD)\n\nThickness: 0.5 inches / 13.4 mm\n\nBattery: Claimed 12 hours, with fast charge\n\nDisplay: 13.3-inch, 16:9 touchscreen; HD (1920 x 1080) or 4K (3840 x 2160)\n\nCamera: Front-facing 2MP, 60 fps, 1080p video\n\nWi-Fi: 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, 2x2 (MIMO), dual-band (2.4 GHz, 5.0 GHz)\n\nBluetooth: 4.2\n\nYou can run Android apps, but I avoided them for the most part. I used Spotify for music, mainly. Chrome OS still has a double-app problem \u2014 the web version and Android versions of Gmail were both vying to send me notifications, for example. At the end of the day I mostly stuck with web apps and their quality is better than you might expect. This year I\u2019ve been super impressed with Adobe Lightroom\u2019s web app.\n\nI unfortunately can\u2019t speak to whether the low-end, $649 Pixelbook Go, which has a Core M3 processor, will perform as well as this one. However, I have recently tested several Chromebooks with chips in that line and so long as they have 8GB of RAM, I didn\u2019t have any complaints. Fortunately, even the low-end the Pixelbook Go includes that much RAM.\n\nThere\u2019s a $999 model that has 16GB of RAM and also a $1,399 model with a 4K screen. You would have to be a pretty dedicated, hardcore Chrome OS lover to come anywhere close to justifying either of those purchases. I sort of feel like they exist simply to hand out to Google employees or for the handful of people who like to use Chromebooks for Linux.\n\nThe big question with the Pixelbook Go for me is whether it can justify its price relative to other Chromebooks. I recently reviewed a half-dozen of them for our best Chromebook article and found that everything in the $500-600 range is incredibly similar. One stood out for its screen and build quality, though, the Asus Chromebook Flip C434.\n\nAs of this writing, a C434 with nearly identical specs to the base Pixelbook Go costs $599, $50 less than the Pixelbook (prices on non-Google Chromebooks vary often, however). The C434 has an all-metal design too, its screen is nearly bezelless and can flip around, and it has both a microSD card slot and a standard USB-A port.\n\nThe Pixelbook Go weighs less and gets slightly better battery life, but what you\u2019re really paying for with that extra $50 is mainly a more elegantly-designed laptop. That\u2019s definitely worth $50 to a lot of people, but giving up the extra ports and the option to flip into tablet mode seems like a bad trade.\n\nSimplicity in product design is mostly good, but on the Pixelbook Go it also means fewer ports and fewer ways to use the screen. Neither is a deal breaker and all things considered I enjoy using the Pixelbook more than I do the C434, but that doesn\u2019t make it a better machine.\n\nIf you are in the market for a Chromebook and happen to find the Pixelbook Go on sale, definitely give it an extra look. But at full price, you have to ask yourself how much simplicity is worth to you.", "description": "Google\u2019s latest Chromebook, the Pixelbook Go, is its least expensive model and it has a great keyboard and excellent battery life.
