He\u2019s operating without a campaign manager and with an often-exhausted skeleton staff, driving himself from Iowa to New Hampshire in a rented minivan and appearing at dozens of hastily organized events.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s an approach that seems to work so far: In addition to the large crowds O\u2019Rourke has attracted, he raised $6.1 million during the first 24 hours of his campaign, a record-setting haul that narrowly tops the amount announced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) and dwarfs everyone else in the 2020 Democratic field.\n\nAD\n\nDuring an unsuccessful Senate campaign in Texas last year, O\u2019Rourke pioneered a new way for Democrats to run for office by holding hundreds of town halls across the state, answering thousands of questions, broadcasting his life on social media, raising record amounts of money from everyday voters and being relentlessly optimistic.\n\nHis presidential campaign is an expansion of that effort. He even kept the same logo, replacing the words \u201cfor Senate\u201d with \u201cfor America.\u201d\n\nAs a presidential candidate, O\u2019Rourke has heavily focused not on specifics but on two sentiments: positivity and humility.\n\nAD\n\nHe has pledged to lead by example and not invest in misleading ads or demean his opponents, even praising former vice president Joe Biden, who could soon join the race. Although O\u2019Rourke is openly critical of President Trump\u2019s policies and rhetoric, he is careful to not personally attack the president.\n\nAD\n\nO\u2019Rourke admits that he doesn\u2019t have the answers to the nation\u2019s biggest challenges and is far from a perfect candidate. He has acknowledged that being a wealthy white man has given him privileges not afforded to all Americans, apologized for \u201creally hateful\u201d things he wrote as a teenager and promised to stop joking about how his wife is raising their three young children with only occasional help from him.\n\nSome voters say they find O\u2019Rourke\u2019s openness refreshing. \u201cSincere,\u201d said a longtime activist at his first campaign event in Keokuk, Iowa. \u201cInspiring,\u201d said an Illinois woman at the same event. \u201cEasy to listen to,\u201d one of her friends added. At other events, other voters added more descriptors: \u201cGenuine.\u201d \u201cA regular guy.\u201d \u201cEarnest.\u201d \u201cTrustworthy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just so positive \u2014 that\u2019s what I like,\u201d said Olga Sanchez, 70, who drove more than two hours Saturday from the Des Moines suburbs to Waterloo to see O\u2019Rourke speak and deliver a campaign donation. \u201cHe\u2019s not saying \u2018straight Democrat,\u2019 he\u2019s not saying \u2018independent,\u2019 he\u2019s not saying \u2018just progressive,\u2019 and he\u2019s not saying no to \u2018Republican\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s just it, he includes everyone. . . . I\u2019m all for inclusivity.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nO\u2019Rourke, while not completely void of policy ideas, spends much more time detailing the challenges facing the country than suggesting fixes. At each campaign stop, he urges questioners to suggest their own solutions, although they rarely do, and often ends his answers with a call for a national conversation.\n\nOn gun control, O\u2019Rourke continued to propose a ban on the sale of new assault weapons and the implementation of universal background checks, while also speaking emotionally about the toll of gun violence, particularly on children.\n\nAD\n\nOn the high cost of college, he reiterated ideas long pushed by Democrats \u2014 such as forgiving the student loans of public servants and creating debt-free \u00adhigher-education options \u2014 while noting the crushing toll such debt has on many young Americans.\n\nAD\n\nOn health care, O\u2019Rourke suggested adding Medicare to insurance marketplaces and giving states another shot at expanding Medicaid, while stating that a solution will be reached only by bringing \u201ceveryone into the conversation.\u201d\n\nOn immigration, O\u2019Rourke has suggested giving citizenship to undocumented immigrants who have long called America home and increasing the number of refugees allowed into the country each year, but has also said he\u2019s still collecting ideas.\n\nHe has promised to protect abortion rights but has not detailed what needs to be done to reverse restrictions placed by Republicans. He has called for higher teacher pay and greater investment in public education, but has not suggested a funding source. He warned voters that they need to find a \u201cbold\u201d solution to climate change in the next 12 years, but he doesn\u2019t yet know what that will be.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Saturday morning, O\u2019Rourke told reporters that he plans to keep up the pace of several events each day and campaign in states that Trump won in 2016. He said the experience has confirmed his belief that Americans are eager for someone to heal the country\u2019s divisions.\n\n\u201cThis campaign has got to be about learning from the people we meet and then finding a way to bring everyone together,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cSo I think this pace and this manner of campaigning is not just, perhaps, the best way to win. It may be the only way to serve if we\u2019re going to meet the challenges before us.\u201d\n\nMatt Viser and Chad Livengood contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "The new presidential candidate\u2019s campaign is as thin as it is wealthy", "authors": ["Jenna Johnson", "National Political Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/i4JUNmkY6ZRHq7odNVJmAPDXktQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UHEXZSCGNYI6TFFL2LO2HQG7KI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-18"}
