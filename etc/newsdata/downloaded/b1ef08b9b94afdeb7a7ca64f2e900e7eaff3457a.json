Until that\u2019s it, we don\u2019t have a dollar left, a person left. We will keep going no matter how hard it is.\u201d\n\nLivingston recently reported that the firm will shut down the Kik app and reduce its staff down to around 10% of the current count. Livingston said that this move is a direct result of the SEC lawsuit, as the company is being drained of its funds.\n\nHowever, in an apparent reversal of earlier plans to shut down in the midst of legal difficulties, the company revealed on Oct. 14 that it\u2019s \u201chere to stay:\u201d", "description": "MediaLab, a Santa Monica-based holding company, has finalized an agreement with Kik Interactive to acquire the Kik messaging platform", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9hNTAxYjY5NTM0NGQwNWQyYmVmYjNmYzUzOWJhZWY0NC5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
