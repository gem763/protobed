The Ring and Sinister are two recent examples. Wounds is in that same cursed-image mould, but it manages to bring some freshness to the idea.\n\nEditor's Note: Wounds is a Hulu original, but if it sounds like it's up your alley, the use of a VPN may help you access this content.\n\n\u201cFreshness\u201d is kind of the wrong descriptor, though, considering all the grime, decay, scuttling insects, oozing wounds, sludge and other icky stuff churning around in Wounds. Armie Hammer stars as Will, a bartender at a New Orleans dive called Rosie\u2019s. Perhaps not surprisingly, Will\u2019s a bit of a boozehound, a condition that has yet to compromise his good looks and easygoing charm behind the bar \u2014 though his live-in girlfriend, Carrie (Dakota Johnson), has started to freeze him out.\n\nHis solution: drink more, do a little coke here and there, and allow his eye to wander to Alicia (Zazie Beetz), a Rosie\u2019s regular he\u2019s always sparked with, and whose new boyfriend (Karl Glusman) seems easy enough to ignore.\n\nThis would be a juicy enough set-up for a slice-of-life drama, but Wounds \u2014 a mostly faithful adaptation of Nathan Ballingrud\u2019s horror novella The Visible Filth by writer-director Babak Anvari (Under the Shadow) \u2014 injects supernatural malevolence that begins when an unidentified cell phone turns up after a rowdy incident at the bar.\n\nA rough night at Rosie\u2019s.\n\nWill doesn\u2019t think much of it until later that night, when it begins buzzing with texts so strange (\u201cI think something\u2019s here with me!\u201d) that he\u2019s inspired to figure out the passcode and reply. A little while later, after a taunting text encourages him to peek at the photos, he starts poking around in the photo albums, discovering images and a video so horrifically graphic he can\u2019t believe they\u2019re real.\n\nCarrie \u2014 who\u2019s suspicious of why Will\u2019s got some other chick\u2019s phone, in a way that suggests she\u2019s had reason to be suspicious of him in the past \u2014 also takes a look, and feels the same mixture of revulsion and fascination he does. She also encourages him to take the phone, which seems to contain evidence of at least one murder, to the cops, though Will manages to lose it before he can show anyone else. No matter; it\u2019s soon made abundantly clear that plenty of damage has already been done to both of them.\n\nWounds builds up a lot of its tension by setting the story in a world that seems grounded \u2014 Rosie\u2019s feels so authentically lived-in that the smell of stale beer practically wafts off the screen \u2014 and then introducing elements that signal how reality is starting to crack. Some of these are electronic, like odd text messages and chilling photos that Will receives from Carrie\u2019s phone that she doesn\u2019t remember sending, and the ominous swirling tunnel that Carrie can\u2019t stop staring at on her laptop. Others are more fleshy and squirmy, like a gaping incision Will thinks he sees in his armpit, and the increasing number of (Real? Imagined? Both?) flying roaches that follow him everywhere.\n\nCast Zazie Beetz in everything, she can do it all.\n\nThe performances also keep Wounds anchored for as long as the story will allow. Hammer, whose most prominent genre role to date is probably Sorry to Bother You (unless you count The Lone Ranger as horror), makes Will likable in spite of his obvious faults.\n\nThose include his alcohol-fuelled lack of anything resembling ambition, as well as his tendency to make alcohol-fuelled bad decisions. While Johnson gets the showier co-starring role \u2014 Carrie gets to be spooky and fragile, but also a sharp-tongued badass \u2014 Beetz (Deadpool 2, Joker) brings that sparkling charisma we\u2019ve seen in all her other characters. You believe that Will would become blinded by his crush on Alicia, because Beetz is the coolest.\n\nWounds may frustrate viewers who can tolerate plot weirdness only if it\u2019s thoroughly explained in the end. Unlike the similarly occult-fuelled Hereditary, for instance, Wounds doesn\u2019t spend much time exploring why all this freaky stuff is happening to Will.\n\nAll we know is that he found a phone previously owned by some college kids who took it upon themselves to conduct an ancient, barbaric \u201critual,\u201d one outcome of which is that whoever engages with their handiwork is immediately a part of it, whether they want to be or not. Huh? OK. Though the movie doesn\u2019t deviate much from the source novella, right down to the very last scene, somehow it feels less satisfying than Ballingrud\u2019s excellent original tale.\n\nNot looking so good there, Carrie.\n\nBut if you\u2019re willing to dive into this visceral blend of creepy tech and body horror, Wounds has its rewards. Anvari\u2019s take on New Orleans is refreshingly low-key and devoid of the clich\u00e9s that filmmakers love to turn to when lensing the city (a drunken Rosie\u2019s patron crooning \u201cWhen the Saints Go Marching In\u201d is one of few obvious signposts, beyond the location shooting).\n\nLiterary references also add some layers to the story. Before she becomes drawn into Will\u2019s phone mystery, grad-student Carrie is consumed by her term paper on T.S. Eliot\u2019s \u201cThe Hollow Men,\u201d which itself ties into Wounds\u2019 epigraph, a quote from Heart of Darkness. At one point, she calls Will \u201ca mock person,\u201d an insult plucked from her academic studies that zeroes in on Will\u2019s own sinking suspicion that he\u2019s been living his life as an empty suit \u2014 with his own personal interpretation of \u201cthis is the way the world ends\u201d coming much sooner, and in a much more gruesome fashion, than he could ever have imagined.\n\nWounds premieres October 19 on Hulu.", "description": "There are plenty of horror movies that trace the downfall of characters who witness an image or film so malevolent that its poison begins to seep into their own lives.
