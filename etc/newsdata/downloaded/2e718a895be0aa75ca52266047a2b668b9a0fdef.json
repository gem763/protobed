The U.S. imposed sanctions on Turkey on Oct. 14, including penalties against three government ministers.\n\nThe lira gained against the euro after Trump\u2019s remarks Wednesday.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision on sanctions -- and assertion that his approach on Turkey was a success -- is likely to reignite bipartisan criticism of the administration\u2019s decision to withdraw forces from northern Syria, exposing U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters to attack by Turkey. Kurds fought alongside American troops against Islamic State in Syria.\n\nTrump says that the cease-fire\u2019s persistence shows his \u201cunconventional\u201d foreign policy approach paid dividends. Shortly after the U.S. pulled out of the region, Turkey invaded and attacked Kurdish fighters, prompting condemnation and sanctions from the White House.\n\nTrump then dispatched U.S. Vice President Mike Pence for meetings in Ankara, where the two sides struck an agreement for a five-day truce intended to allow Kurdish fighters to evacuate an area 120 kilometers long and 30 kilometers deep between the border towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn.\n\n\u201cThis was an outcome created by us, the United States, and nobody else,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re willing to take blame and we\u2019re also willing to take credit.\u201d\n\nTrump repeated his stance that the U.S. shouldn\u2019t police the region. \u201cLet someone else fight over this long-bloodstained sand,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Trump reiterated previous statements that a small contingent of U.S. forces will remain to guard oil fields in northern Syria, adding cryptically that \u201cwe\u2019ll decide what we\u2019re doing with it in the future.\u201d\n\nCritics have charged that the agreement is a functional victory for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has long sought to push Kurdish fighters he considers terrorists from his country\u2019s border, at the expense of the Kurds. But Trump said in a tweet on Wednesday that the Kurds \u201care safe and have worked very nicely with us.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to a separate pact that would clear Kurdish fighters from a northeastern zone in Syria also bordering Turkey. The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prompted further bipartisan criticism of Trump\u2019s withdrawal.\n\n\u201cThe only people who benefit from more violence and more chaos are America\u2019s adversaries: Vladimir Putin, Bashar al-Assad, the terror sponsoring dictatorship in Iran, and Islamist extremists in the area and around the world, as shown by the deal that Erdogan struck yesterday with Putin,\u201d Representative Michael McCaul, the senior Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said at a hearing on the Syria situation on Wednesday.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t directly address the issue of Russia benefiting from the U.S. withdrawal. But at the same time he was speaking, U.S. Central Command chief General Kenneth McKenzie addressed a conference in Washington, saying \u201cChina and Russia are working very hard today to reshuffle the balance of power in the CENTCOM area of responsibility, trying to displace the U.S. from its position of influence in the region.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Russians and Assad and Iran are going to fill the vacuum\u201d left by the U.S. withdrawal, McCaul told Trump\u2019s Syria envoy James Jeffrey.\n\nAnd Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is usually a close Trump ally, called the Turkey-Russia pact \u201ca non-starter\u201d on Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s not a sustainable solution.\u201d\n\n(Updates with Islamic State in fifth paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Glen Carey.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Josh Wingrove in Washington at jwingrove4@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alex Wayne at awayne3@bloomberg.net, Justin Blum, Joshua Gallu\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he is lifting recently imposed sanctions against Turkey after the country complied with a cease-fire agreement with Kurdish forces in Syria.\u201cThe sanctions will be lifted -- unless something happens that we\u2019re not happy with,\u201d Trump said Wednesday in a statement", "authors": ["Josh Wingrove"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uyeoRi7JzFoS2GV5OSF9Xw--~B/aD0xMTIwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/1b5473531e8daad73d3322e6daacc286", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
