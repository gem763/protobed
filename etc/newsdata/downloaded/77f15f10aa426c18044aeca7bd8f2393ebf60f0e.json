When Livia Firth launched her consultancy, Eco-Age, a decade ago, she says, \u201cit was something no one was talking about\u201d. During the current round of fashion shows \u2013 from Extinction Rebellion\u2019s protests to dresses made from recycled plastic bottles \u2013 people have talked about little else.\n\nIn the last two months, says Firth, \u201cwe have turned a corner finally. It is a beautiful moment, but it is also very dangerous. Fast fashion is the first offender in sustainability and there is greenwashing at a level there has never been before\u201d.\n\nFirth is speaking from Milan as she and her team put the finishing touches to the Green Carpet Fashion Awards. Now in its third year, the event focuses on fashion\u2019s social \u201chandprint\u201d rather than its environmental \u201cfootprint\u201d, though the two are inextricably linked.\n\nIts aim is to celebrate the unsung heroes making fashion a more ethical business, she says, rattling off a list that includes cobblers and fashion studio staff to the \u201cmayor of a tiny town which is reviving an ancient technique\u201d.\n\nIf that makes Sunday night\u2019s event sound low-key, it really isn\u2019t. It\u2019s an Oscars-like production with 1,000 guests and A-list headliners. In the past Donatella Versace and Miuccia Prada have won prizes, while Cate Blanchett and Julianne Moore have presented them. This year the 87-year-old pug-loving designer Valentino Garavani will collect the Visionary award, while the gondoliers of Venice will be applauded for switching to natural fibres for their striped uniforms. The world\u2019s best-known designers will produce gowns, too, working with Eco-Age on looks \u201caccording to our principles\u201d.\n\nFirth has been a major player in ethical fashion since 2011, when her husband, Colin Firth, won an Oscar. Gifted with the visibility of being a plus-one for plenty of awards seasons, she chose to wear exclusively ethical brands. At the time ethical style was perceived as a bit of a party pooper, and Firth freely admits: \u201cI could probably have never done it if it wasn\u2019t for Colin and having the opportunity to be on the red carpet.\u201d Through the years, though, things have evolved and people are now more open to speaking, directly, about issues such as exploitation.\n\nIn mainstream fashion conversation, though, it is sustainable \u2013 not ethical \u2013 that has become the hottest buzzword. It says something about human nature that environmental concerns have affected buying habits in a way the human cost alone never quite did, even after the 2013 Rana Plaza tragedy. Then, 1,134 people died after an unsafe building in Bangladesh collapsed. It was the workplace of garment workers making clothes for some of the world\u2019s leading fast-fashion retailers.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Colin Firth and Livia Firth at the Green Carpet Fashion Awards in Milan last year.

Fast-fashion brands have recently pledged to use sustainable materials. But it is the human cost, not the type of fabric used, \u201cwhich is almost the primary cause of environmental pollution\u201d, she says.\n\n\u201cIf they [brands] could not produce so much clothing so cheaply by using slave labour, you wouldn\u2019t have the environmental impact.\u201d Improving fashion\u2019s social cost is something fast-fashion brands \u201ccannot appropriate\u201d, she says, \u201cunless they change their core business model and produce less.\n\n\u201cYou cannot make a monster sustainable,\u201d she adds. \u201cThe very nature of it is that it\u2019s a monster.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s very different in the luxury space, she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t work with all of the brands \u2013 but the ones that we do work with make a completely different commitment to what they do because there is a lot of money to invest in research in development.\u201d\n\nOne of Eco-Age\u2019s clients, Kering, for example, has been singled out for praise after \u201cinvesting tonnes and tonnes of money\u201d understanding how to do things differently and introducing an environmental profit and loss statement.\n\nClearly, Firth\u2019s approach is very different to that of Extinction Rebellion, which campaigned for London Fashion Week to be closed altogether, though Firth thinks the group may have a point.\n\nHowever, the Green Carpet Awards are more of a carrot to the industry than a stick, being co-run with the chairman of the Italian equivalent of the British Fashion Council. It has its own footprint to be considered, with the plants on the red carpet to be donated to communal gardens in Milan and the green carpet made from recycled fishing nets rescued from the ocean.\n\nFirth has proved that such glamorous awareness-raising works \u2013 and she has just found out she has been made an honorary MBE for her efforts. \u201cIt will be a weapon of mass construction,\u201d she says. Like being Colin Firth\u2019s wife, or being awarded UN Leader of Change, she says, \u201cit will mean people will listen. Whatever it takes to spread the message.\u201d", "description": "With the Green Carpet Fashion Awards opening in Milan, the eco pioneer explains why the once-unfashionable concept is a winner", "authors": ["Hannah Marriott"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b8369b379fb119d008e7c014fb6aba1f6b44db5/0_88_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=24e9fe22446b06ac4d450d178b7f3bfe", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
