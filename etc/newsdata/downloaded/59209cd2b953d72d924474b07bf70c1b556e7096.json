Yato, hit in the head and neck area by Hodge\u2019s shoulder, left the game with symptoms of concussion and was ruled out of Fiji\u2019s second pool game against Uruguay on Wednesday.\n\nFiji players complained at the time to New Zealand referee Ben O\u2019Keefe and requested a video review, but neither the referee nor Television Match Official, who viewed the tackle from two angles, took any action. Australia rallied from nine-points down to win 39-21.\n\nHodge faces a suspension of up to 10 weeks. Cheika was hoping his hearing could be held Monday.\n\nWhile disappointed Hodge was cited, Cheika said \u201cprobably the most disappointing thing was the Fijians.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter the game we had a lot of friendly discussion between myself and the coach (McKee). He talked to our other coaches, there was no mention of anything,\u201d Cheika said, \u201cand to get a referral from them and the way it was referred, that was really disappointing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t find the way they brought that (to be) in the spirit of the game at all. I prefer they come up to me, get upset with me if they are really upset with me, not talk to me in that nice, friendly, chitty-chat way and then go behind your back and put in a referral.\u201d\n\nCheika said he believed Hodge will be cleared, but he was also annoyed that he was even cited.\n\n\u201cI was surprised it was cited,\u201d Cheika said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t even register with me. Hodge was thinking (Yato) was going for the corner and he cut inside. It was a good tackle for him to make. And he\u2019s the one who got barreled in the end.\u201d\n\nCheika noted World Rugby advised coaches just last week it would be more empathetic to playing situations, and believed the citing weakens the match officials\u2019 decisions.\n\n\u201cThey called all the coaches to Tokyo for a meeting last Tuesday with the referees\u2019 boss and the citing commissioners\u2019 boss, Steve Hines, and then with the judiciary committee boss, and they explained the way things would work which all sounded really good.\n\n\u201cThey are looking to have a bit more empathy for the game, in footballing situations. But why I say disappointing is the fact Steve Hines mentioned that if the team of four (referee, two assistant referees and the TMO) have dealt with it on the day it would have to be clear and obvious for it to get cited.\n\n\u201cAnd I think it was pretty clear all the officials dealt with it on the day.\u201d\n\nCheika said the touch judge saw it, the TMO assessed at the footage and the citing \u201cis the lack of confidence in the referees.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat puts doubt in the referees for the next game \u2026 and that\u2019s not fair to them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got that doubt put in them.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Australia coach Michael Cheika accused Fiji counterpart John McKee of being two-faced and going against \"the spirit\" of rugby by referring winger Reece Hodge for a citing at the World Cup.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Foster Niumata"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/japan_rugby_wcup_australia_fiji_59640_c0-121-2891-1806_s1770x1032.jpg?06869a14be0fc2ee8a69f81c9b8c5accdd673098", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
