The arena that hosted the event has withdrawn its request, but the city maintains that the cost of services provided for campaign events should come from Mr Trump\u2019s campaign chest and not city coffers.\n\nMinneapolis mayor Jacob Frey said that the city\u2019s taxpayers \u201cshould not have to bear the brunt of operating costs resulting from the president\u2019s visit\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

CNN found that six of those cities still are waiting for checks.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

There rarely are contracts or agreements between the campaign and municipal governments, which ultimately determine whether to dispatch the additional services, despite Secret Service details requiring them.\n\nA representative from one city told CNN that the city does not typically bill for city services provided to campaign events. Another city representative said they do send invoices but they also don\u2019t expect they\u2019ll actually be paid.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Law states that political committees \u201cshall report a disputed debt \u2026 if the creditor has provided something of value to the political committee\u201d.\n\nIn its mandatory reports to the Federal Election Commission, the Trump campaign did not disclose actual debts or \u201cdisputed debts\u201d to cities or their police departments.", "description": "As Donald Trump prepares for a rally in Louisiana ahead of the state\u2019s gubernatorial election, the president\u00a0is reportedly on the hook for\u00a0hundreds of thousands of dollars in local security costs in at least six other cities where his campaign has held rallies and events.", "authors": ["Alex Woodward"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/11/09/donald-trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
