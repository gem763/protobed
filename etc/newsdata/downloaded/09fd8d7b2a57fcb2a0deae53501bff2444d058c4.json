If your relationships have tilted out of harmony, maybe now you can work to restore them. If your life has tilted away from beauty, maybe now you can find your way to shift it back. On Saturday, a new moon in Libra offers a chance to set new intentions for the days ahead: What strength will you draw from your relationships with other people, and what will you accomplish together?\n\nAries\n\nIt might feel, initially, as though you\u2019re being overlooked this week \u2014 as though no matter how bright you keep shining, nobody sees you right; as though no matter how well you do, nobody\u2019s even paying attention. Try not to internalize this as an insult or a judgment of your value. Instead, see it as an opportunity: Right now, you don\u2019t have to dazzle everyone so much, and you don\u2019t have to dominate. You can relax into the simpler sweetness of living alongside other people, quietly supporting each other, quietly doing your best together.\n\nTaurus\n\nFor a while, you\u2019ve suppressed your anger, and maybe this has been wise \u2014 maybe you\u2019ve been all too aware that your body wasn\u2019t strong enough to withstand the intense heat of it. This week, though, it\u2019s possible that enough time has passed, that you can look at your anger without being consumed by it. It\u2019s possible that what once was a burden might now become an energy source, or a light to guide your way.\n\nGemini\n\nYou\u2019re very good at registering what goes on around you, to the point where it can sometimes feel as though you\u2019re noticing everything at once, and your mind can start to strain from all that it\u2019s being asked to do. But you don\u2019t have to start noticing less; you don\u2019t have to try to limit your scope. Rather, this is a week for noticing patterns and connections, for seeing the symmetry and the repetitions in the world around you. By examining the bigger picture, you might find the chaos easier to bear.\n\nCancer\n\nThis week, you might suddenly find yourself with a sharper sense of your place in the world. You might find yourself seeing more clearly how your own movements affect the the world\u2019s balance. It can be terrifying to recognize that you hold some power in the world after all, but it\u2019s not a bad or undeserved thing. This week, try to recognize the strength you\u2019ve been given, and decide how to use it.\n\nLeo\n\nMaybe your immense love for the world has started feeling more like a curse than a source of power, something that leaves you vulnerable to others. This week, though, you might feel a small shift, a small feeling of optimism that your love might be worth something after all. Think about how you can turn it into strength, into support, into solidarity. Your arms are only so strong, and your voice can only carry so far, but there\u2019s still so much worth doing. This week, give your love every chance you can to flourish and thrive.\n\nVirgo\n\nSometimes, conclusions take longer to reach than you want them to; sometimes, even when you feel ready for answers, the world refuses to easily open up for you. And it isn\u2019t a bad thing to be asked just to keep going. It isn\u2019t a bad thing to continue to learn, continue to move, continue to work steadily alongside other people. Your everyday life will offer its own quiet gifts to you this week. Even if the big answers you\u2019re looking for might not show themselves yet, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve been wasting your time.\n\nLibra\n\nThis is a week to think about reciprocity: about all the ways you\u2019ve been loved and assisted, and all the ways you\u2019ve turned around and offered that same love back again. It\u2019s a week for remembering to thank the people who have made your beautiful life worth living, but also for looking around and noticing who is struggling, and reaching out when you can. This isn\u2019t about setting debts and closing loops; it isn\u2019t about repayment. Rather, this is a week for making sure you\u2019re keeping all your best love in circulation.\n\nScorpio\n\nSometimes, curiosity just feels so much like vulnerability, like an admission of how very much you still don\u2019t know. This week, try to let yourself be curious anyway. Let yourself ask genuine questions \u2014 even the ones that reveal your imperfect understanding of the world and even the ones that reveal you don\u2019t know where your own life will take you. It isn\u2019t a secret that you don\u2019t know what the future holds; after all, nobody else does, either. Curiosity can change you, and it can broaden your powers. Try, this week, to accept its gifts.\n\nSagittarius\n\nYour mind is sharp enough to justify nearly anything you want to do \u2014 you can make any choice, good or bad, seem dazzling, and any move, wise or foolish, sound like the thing that will save your life. This week, it\u2019s important that you hold onto the knowledge that you might be wrong. You might make a misstep, you might need to turn back, and there isn\u2019t anything wrong with that. It\u2019s okay to turn around, to rest, to start again. You\u2019re no more and no less human than anyone else.\n\nCapricorn\n\nYou might find yourself doing constant mental calculations about exactly how much happiness you deserve. You might find yourself keeping some kind of ledger in your mind: in one column, all the things you\u2019ve done to earn beauty or safety or peace, and on the other, all the ways you\u2019ve found yourself lacking. Your critical eye is a valuable tool, but don\u2019t turn it so ruthlessly on yourself that you forget the truth, which is that you deserve goodness in your life, no matter what. And no matter how many times you try to calculate otherwise, it will still be true.\n\nAquarius\n\nAfter a period of cold reality, after a period where every truth seemed too harsh to believe, you might find yourself newly open to the world\u2019s beauty this week. It can seem scary at first, as though having hope makes you foolish and vulnerable. But there\u2019s nothing wrong with allowing yourself to feel optimistic anyway. There\u2019s nothing shameful about letting your guard down enough for the smell of the sweet nighttime air to reach you. This week, let yourself be vulnerable enough to enjoy the gifts you\u2019re being offered.\n\nPisces\n\nThis week, you might feel suddenly flooded by the sheer volume of other people\u2019s ideas, or other people\u2019s stories, or other people\u2019s opinions about how a person should live. And the depth and range of these different ideas can make you feel suddenly insecure about your own. Times like this, it can be easy to let that insecurity bully you into losing sight of your own specific desires, or into caring about things you don\u2019t actually care about at all. Try to remember that you don\u2019t have to do everything, you don\u2019t have to be everything. You can hold steady; you can keep your focus.\n\nGet Madame Clairevoyant every week.
