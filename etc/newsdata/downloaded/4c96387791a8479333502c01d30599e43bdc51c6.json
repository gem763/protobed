Hyten for Joint Chiefs despite sex controversy", "language": "en", "text": "The Senate has confirmed Gen. John E. Hyten to be vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff nearly three months after the four-star Air Force general was accused of sexual misconduct.\n\nFollowing the 75-22 vote to confirm Gen. Hyten to be the second-highest-ranking uniformed military officer, Sen. Jim Inhofe, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said his committee has \u201cdone due diligence to ensure that not only is Gen. Hyten capable and qualified, but the best candidate for the job. \u201c\n\nIn July, the Associated Press reported that a senior military officer accused the Air Force general of sexual misconduct which prompted several investigations, including a military inquiry, but did not see enough evidence to charge Gen. Hyten.\n\nArmy Col. Kathryn Spletstoser, said she felt a \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d to come forward with the allegations after she said the general kissed her and pressed himself against her when they were alone in a hotel room.\n\nThe Senate panel then conducted several private inquiries and a formal, public confirmation hearing in August in which members on both sides of the aisle praised Gen. Hyten as a leader in the future of the military\u2019s space and hypersonic systems and stood by him as he denied the allegations.\n\nBefore his confirmation, Gen. Hyten was responsible for the U.S. nuclear arsenal as the commander of U.S. Strategic Command, and had been rumored to be a top pick to lead a future Space Force.\n\n\u201cHis path to confirmation was a fair, thorough and bipartisan process, and the vote today reinforces that. America will be safer with General Hyten in the job, and I am glad the Senate voted to confirm him,\u201d Mr. Inhofe said.\n\nSen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, who served for more than 20 years in the Iowa Army National Guard, was the only Republican to vote against the nominee.\n\nFollowing the vote, Col. Spletstoser said her experience coming forward with the accusations \u201chas only served to demonstrate how unequipped the military still is to deal with sexual assault. The process for seeking justice has been a sham.\u201d\n\n\u201cGeneral Hyten\u2019s confirmation should not be a popularity contest; this process should be about integrity, facts, and the truth,\u201d she said in a statement as she maintained her accusations against the new vice chairman. \u201cIt should be part of a broader conversation about reforming the process for adjudicating military sexual assault.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
