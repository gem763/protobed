They were born in March and April at the Nashville Zoo.\n\nThey\u2019ll be on exhibit starting Wednesday for short periods. They\u2019ll be on display to the public from 10:30 to 11:30 a.m. at the zoo\u2019s Asia Trail.\n\nZoo officials said the cubs are \u201clearning how to climb\u201d and becoming more independent. As they get more familiar with their new exhibit, zoo keepers said, they\u2019ll spend more time in public view.\n\nZookeepers have been working with the young cubs on various skills, such as teaching them to touch a target so \u201ckeepers can look at different parts of their bodies,\u201d officials said.\n\n\n\nPaitoon, a rare clouded leopard cub, plays at the National Zoo in Washington.

He said they\u2019ve been busy \u201cexploring and investigating every nook-and-cranny of their new home.\u201d\n\nClouded leopards are native to Southeast Asia. They are arboreal and have sharp claws, long tails and large paws. They like to climb, wrestle and vocalize to each other, experts said.\n\nThey\u2019re listed as \u201cvulnerable\u201d by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Experts said about 10,000 clouded leopards live in the wild. They face such threats as deforestation and illegal wildlife trafficking, according to experts.\n\nIn captivity, clouded leopards typically are \u201chand-raised as cubs\u201d so it improves their survival chances, experts said. They usually get paired with future mates when they\u2019re 1-year-old.\n\n\n\nA roughly 6-month-old clouded leopard at the National Zoo. It and another cub will go on display Wednesday.
