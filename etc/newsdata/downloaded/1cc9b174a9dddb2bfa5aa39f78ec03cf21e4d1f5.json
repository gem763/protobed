Another 42% said he \u201cshould not be impeached\u201d and 14% said they were not sure.\n\nAmericans had expressed stronger interest last month in sanctioning the president - and possibly removing him from office - through congressional impeachment after a government whistleblower revealed that Trump may have misused the power of his office to help his chances at winning re-election.\n\nThe whistleblower reported that Trump appeared to be pressuring Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July 25 phone call to pursue unsubstantiated allegations of corruption against former Vice President Joe Biden, an early favorite to win the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nIt has leveled off since then, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. Opinions are also sharply divided along party lines, and political scientists say they are likely to remain that way with only a handful of prominent Republican leaders publicly criticizing the president.\n\nTrump has denied any wrongdoing, and he has tried to block administration officials from cooperating with the House of Representatives impeachment inquiry.\n\nSo far, the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani appears to be following Trump\u2019s orders, but several other administration officials have agreed to testify.\n\nThe poll also found that 40% of the public approved of Trump, while 54% disapproved.\n\nAnd while 57% of Americans think Congress should investigate whether Trump committed impeachable offenses over the Ukraine call, a similar majority - 60% - believe Congress \u201cshould focus on fixing important problems facing Americans, rather than focusing on investigating President Trump.\u201d\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It included responses from 1,115 adults, and it has a credibility interval, a measure of the poll\u2019s precision, of about 3 percentage points.", "description": "Support for impeaching U.S. President Donald Trump cooled off this week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, as the White House hunkered down for an extended fight over allegations that the administration pushed a foreign government to investigate one of Trump's Democratic rivals.", "authors": ["Chris Kahn", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
