And once back in civilian life, he indeed became one of the comics industry\u2019s most sought-after storytellers, known for expressing the low-level unease of being alive with emotional resonance, efficiency, and frequent doses of gut-punch wisdom.\n\nIn Vertigo\u2019s The Sheriff of Babylon, a globe-sprawling series set in post-invasion Iraq, he vented a war\u2019s worth of frustration at the \u201cbullshitting\u201d he witnessed from the inside out. In Marvel\u2019s The Vision, he told a haunting story about family and a universal need for acceptance\u2014using a cast of androids, no less. DC\u2019s The Omega Men was nominally about superheroes in an intergalactic conflict. But really, it was about the impossible murkiness of our world\u2014about religion and terrorism and the futility of war, and how simple it can be to root for the wrong cause. \u201cIt sold nothing,\u201d King jokes.\n\nJust three years into his full-time comics-writing career, in 2016, King landed DC\u2019s biggest title, the one about the guy in a batsuit. His Batman run ignited a nerd-world maelstrom when Bruce Wayne\u2019s long-promised wedding to Catwoman ended with the bride-to-be ditching him at the altar. The New York Times spoiled the twist early in its wedding vows section and an aghast King weathered tweetstorms\u2014and death threats\u2014from pissed-off fans for months. \u201cThere used to be a bounty on my head from the fucking Taliban\u2014I can deal with a few Twitter followers,\u201d he told Polygon at the time, with the towering bodyguard his jittery agent assigned to him at a convention in tow.\n\nKing\u2019s tenure as custodian of Gotham\u2019s favorite son will cut short 15 issues shy of his promised 100-issue run later this year\u2014not due to creative issues, but because King is now busy helping pen director Ava DuVernay\u2019s New Gods movie, adapting the mad cosmic world Jack Kirby dreamed up in the \u201970s. More of his work is soon coming to the screen, too: a dystopian TV project dubbed States of America, plus another \u201csecret TV thing\u201d that has yet to be announced. (Bat-fans need not worry: the ending King originally intended for his Gotham-set saga will be repurposed as a Batman/Catwoman standalone miniseries early next year.)\n\nHe\u2019s riding the kind of career high comics creators dream of\u2014welcomed by Hollywood, the toast of the comics world. (At San Diego Comic-Con, where the Eisner Awards are handed out, King was this year\u2019s most-nominated creator in attendance. He walked away with Best Writer for the second year in a row, and his and artist Mitch Gerads\u2019 masterpiece, the limited-series Mister Miracle, claimed all three prizes it was up for.)\n\nKing\u2019s writing might have struck a chord in any decade. But it\u2019s Mister Miracle that, perhaps more than his other work, speaks expressly to the feeling of this moment in time: the nagging suspicion that reality is too strange to be true; the fear of being trapped in it, or inside your own head; how joy and mundanity mingle here with existential threats and the absurd; and ultimately, how each of us must choose how to live with it.\n\nHe took a character of Kirby\u2019s invention, a god and escape artist named Scott Free, and centered him amid mythic forces of good and evil that amount to set dressing in a story about how hard it is to be a person. (Let alone a new father, as King was when he left the CIA and as Scott becomes by Mister Miracle\u2019s end.) King has lived with PTSD and depression of his own; he does not pretend that Scott, even by the series\u2019 end, can be \u201ccured.\u201d But that\u2019s the point. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes you live, right?\u201d King tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s still a part of you. And it\u2019s not part of you in a bad way. To be alive is to have this.\u201d\n\nKing applied to join the CIA almost immediately after 9/11. He was working at the Justice Department in Washington, D.C. when terrorists hit the Pentagon. From then on, as he tells the story, he wanted to be \u201cone of the people who helps out.\u201d\n\nComics had been a refuge for him as a shy, sometimes bullied kid growing up in Los Angeles. He hoped one day to write them. While a student at Columbia University, he interned at DC\u2019s Vertigo imprint and at Marvel Comics, where he was an assistant to celebrated X-Men writer Chris Claremont. But by the mid-\u201990s, the comic-book market crashed spectacularly and left the industry\u2019s future in serious doubt. At a time when it seemed possible that there might not be a Marvel or DC Comics much longer, King turned to more stable job prospects. He thought of going to law school. And then he became a spy.\n\n\u201cI loved that job,\u201d King says of his six and a half years with the CIA, hands stuffed in the pockets of a Batman logo-emblazoned hoodie, soft-spoken but grinning when we meet in Chelsea. \u201cI was good at it, too. I was super proud of it. I have very few skills, but I can get one terrorist to spy on another.\u201d For four and a half months, he was stationed in Iraq; he spent a year on the job in Pakistan, too. It was the part of the job he liked best: being overseas, \u201cespecially in war zones.\u201d In a photo taken in 2004 in front of Baghdad\u2019s Swords of Q\u0101dis\u012byah arches, King stands with shoulders squared, feet spread apart, clutching an assault rifle. In loose-fitting, dirt-stained jeans (and a slightly fuller head of hair), he looks tough if vaguely, irrepressibly dorky\u2014a geek who can kill.\n\nIn Mister Miracle, Scott and his wife Big Barda fight to quell a war between the hellish planet of Apokolips and the benevolent realm of New Genesis. It might be the last thing you end up remembering about the story, though. King and Gerads instead ground the book in Scott\u2019s state of mind\u2014his boredom, hopes, claustrophobia, and wryness as he heaves himself through everyday life. To him, the mission to keep the Anti-Life Equation (an all-powerful, mind-controlling MacGuffin) out of his sinister adoptive father Darkseid\u2019s hands is both a universe-saving mandate and the equivalent of just his day job. The harder thing, for Scott, is living with the scars his years under Darkseid\u2019s stewardship imprinted on his psyche.\n\n\u201c The people who are angry at the president have that anger, and the people who get their anger from the president have their anger, and there\u2019s nowhere for that anger to go except at each other. \u201d\n\nKing\u2019s own anxiety informed his idea of Scott Free, an escape artist who can\u2019t get out of his own head. \u201cThe book started when I had one of those first-episode-of-the-Sopranos panic attacks and I ended up in the hospital,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was one of those things where you ask the doctor, \u2018Am I dying or am I crazy?\u2019 And they tell you you\u2019re crazy and you\u2019re like, woo-hoo! Oh, wait a second.\u201d He laughs. \u201cI thought I was a pretty tough guy. I\u2019d been to war twice, I\u2019d had three kids. In my own little nerdy corner of the world I was pretty successful. But there was something brittle inside of me.\u201d\n\nMister Miracle was his chance to write about those brittle parts\u2014and about the creeping suspicion in the age of Trump that reality is fundamentally, metaphysically even, coming undone. \u201cWe live in a time of anxiety right now and we gotta acknowledge this at some point,\u201d he says. He starts and abandons several thoughts mid-sentence until, in revved-up emotion, he utters \u201cfuck it\u201d and plows ahead: \u201cI don\u2019t care if I\u2019m political. What the president is putting out there is reflecting on everybody. And the people who are angry at the president have that anger, and the people who get their anger from the president have their anger, and there\u2019s nowhere for that anger to go except at each other, or inside, and we\u2019re all living with that everyday.\u201d\n\nAnger strains the \u201clittle cracks\u201d inside a person, he says. \u201cIt finds your weak points and makes them worse. How do we live our lives with that?\u201d\n\nKing opens the book in the minutes after Scott Free\u2019s failed suicide attempt. By its final panel, whether the reality we\u2019ve witnessed is authentic or not is left unanswered, both to Scott and to us. Artist and colorist Gerads peppers pages with small moments of dissonance: Scott remembers his wife\u2019s eyes being blue, though they are brown\u2014except in the first issue\u2019s second-to-last panel. Only flashbacks to Scott\u2019s feats of escape are narrated as if by a booming TV announcer, yet moments from everyday life seem to glitch, too, blurring scenes like a skipping VHS tape. The effect is purposely jarring\u2014a reminder of how trapped Scott feels.\n\nThe image distortions, originally Gerads\u2019 ideas, mimic a familiar feeling for King. \u201cTo me it\u2019s like that moment when you\u2019re having a great day and you\u2019re going, well, I\u2019m just going to pick up my phone and check Twitter and read the news,\u201d he says, smiling at the self-own. \u201cAnd you\u2019re like, oh, I\u2019m still in this goddamn\u2014the awful continues, you know? I\u2019m still trapped in this weird reality.\u201d\n\nHe likens the sensation to the way the world seemed to tilt after 9/11. \u201cWe were like, wow, something just happened that we\u2019ve never seen happen before. It felt like a break from reality,\u201d he remembers. \u201cAnd then it felt like we just gathered ourselves and kind of found a new normal and were living in it. And now it\u2019s like we break every day.\u201d\n\nThe most inspired moments in Mister Miracle relegate the physical war against Darkseid to the background, often literally.\n\nIn one sequence, Scott and Barda deflect lasers, wade past freakish sea monsters, and take out armed guards as they break into Apokolips. They spend the entire scene\u2014nine-plus pages\u2014discussing little more than the cons and merits of decluttering their condo. After Scott is sentenced to be executed in a rigged trial, they spend a day at the Santa Monica pier, then stuck in traffic, shooting the shit in the comfortable banter of a long-term couple. And Darkseid\u2019s most memorable transgression, apart from being an evil warlord, is double-dipping a half-bitten carrot in a veggie platter\u2019s ranch tray.\n\nThey\u2019re unremarkable events unfolding in heightened, surreal circumstances; sometimes touching, funny, or grim. The juxtapositions are essential to King, who likens the scenes to the memory of debriefing a source in Iraq in 120-degree weather. \u201cWe were both sweating and talking about a guy getting his head chopped off. It was horrible,\u201d he remembers. \u201cBut it was my wife\u2019s birthday.\u201d He recalls shuffling into a corner, calling his wife, and singing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d in half-hushed tones. \u201cThat\u2019s what life is, right? The mundane lives right next to the crazy.\u201d\n\nKing resigned from the CIA after his wife gave birth to their first son. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be that guy who was at the office 13 hours a day and going overseas all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be the father I wanted to be and the officer I wanted to be.\u201d So he became a \u201chouse dad,\u201d cranking out his first novel in his spare time. A Once Crowded Sky, about the last superhero in a world suddenly bereft of them, debuted in 2012 to strong reviews and middling sales. Still, it recommitted King to his early ambition of penning superhero sagas of his own.\n\n\u201c I think it\u2019s up to people who work in this genre to take that basic format and personalize it, but also be ambitious about it, try to address the great themes of our life. \u201d\n\nHis comic-book debut came in 2013, with a short story titled \u201cIt\u2019s Full of Demons\u201d in the Vertigo anthology title Time Warp. Three fruitful years later, he was writing Batman. \u201cSuperheroes today are what Westerns were in the \u201950s,\u201d he figures. \u201cIt\u2019s almost become a common mythical language between all of us. John Ford or Howard Hawks, they could take that Western trope and start to transcend the clich\u00e9s by building upon them. I think it\u2019s up to people who work in this genre to take that basic format and personalize it, but also be ambitious about it, try to address the great themes of our life.\u201d\n\nPart of Mister Miracle\u2019s ambition is to capture a feeling many know intimately, but which can be hard to put into words. King and Gerads articulate that dread succinctly, often with a single phrase: \u201cDarkseid Is.\u201d Panels black out without warning, flashing the phrase in typewriter lettering. It interrupts moments of loneliness or disassociation. But it can also be a punchline, or a shrug: When Big Barda says it, for example, she could just as well say \u201cshit happens.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was obsessed with making people uneasy while they read the book,\u201d says Gerads, a two-time individual Eisner winner for his work on Mister Miracle. \u201cYou force the reader to stop reading and consider the weight of that panel, and it lasts as you continue reading.\u201d\n\nA DC web comic artist named Julian Lytle introduced King to the phrase, the writer explains. \u201cHe was like, do you ever feel like you walk out and just can\u2019t take another step, you have to turn around and go back? That\u2019s Darkseid Is. Or do you ever have two choices and you know what the right one is but you make the wrong one anyway? That\u2019s Darkseid Is. Your belly drops and you get a lump in your throat and you can\u2019t breathe and all of a sudden, you feel the evil of the world creep up on you. You\u2019re aware that you\u2019re stuck on this planet, stuck in this situation and you can\u2019t get out. And \u2018Darkseid Is\u2019 is that feeling.\u201d\n\nIn the story\u2019s final frame, Scott peers out playfully from a \u201cDarkseid Is\u201d panel, his grinning toddler clinging to his leg. He\u2019s chosen to accept the reality he exists in, whether it\u2019s manipulated or a dream, and to live, despite the darkness that threatens to swallow him. Darkseid still is, and Scott Free cannot escape that. No one can. But, King says, \u201cYou can\u2019t just be buried underneath it. You have a duty to your family, you have a duty to your job, you have a duty to keep fighting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to,\u201d he says. \u2018There\u2019s no choice.\u201d", "description": "With Marvel\u2019s \u201cThe Vision\u201d and DC Comics\u2019 \u201cMister Miracle,\u201d Tom King has risen to the top of the comic-book world.
