He is a living miracle, and we have never felt prouder of him.\u201d\n\nDoctors said Michael has a cardiac fibroma, which is a tumor that stops the flow of blood to the heart.\n\n\u201cMichael\u2019s tumor is 5 centimeters, or about 2 inches, wide. That\u2019s enormous compared to a baby\u2019s tiny heart, which is about the size of their fist,\u201d according to CBS 4.\n\nHowever, no surgeon in the UK had the expertise to remove the extremely rare tumor. Therefore, Michael\u2019s parents had to decide if they wanted to wait for a heart transplant or find a surgeon outside the country who could hopefully save their child\u2019s life.\n\nThat is when the Labuschagne\u2019s discovered the Cardiac Tumor Program at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\n\u201cWe researched the hospital and specifically the cardiac surgeons, Dr. (Pedro) del Nido and Dr. (Tal) Geva,\u201d the boy\u2019s mother said. \u201cThey have a 100% success rate and an exceptional reputation. From this moment we knew that we had to try and make this journey.\u201d\n\nShe started a GoFundMe page to raise the $147,000 needed for the treatment and have so far received more than enough to pay for the surgery they hope will take place in April.\n\n\u201cWe are completely overwhelmed with the love and support we have been shown\u2026 Thank you so much guys, from the bottom of our hearts! Nothing could have ever prepared us for this incredible response,\u201d his mother wrote in an update on the fundraising page.", "description": "A 14-month-old baby recognized his father and smiled after waking up from a five-day coma recently in the United Kingdom.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/happy-little-baby-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
