Not abandon the Coke name of course, just broaden the product portfolio in a manner not seen since its founding in 1892.\n\nWhat that has meant for Coke (KO) under Quincey\u2019s leadership is the introduction of mini cans of full-calorie soda to cater to consumers that want some sugar, but not a ton of sugar. It has meant lime-flavored Diet Coke in slim cans, because millennials are demanding flavors without the calories. It has meant signing off on a 2020 U.S. launch (at long last) on a Coke-branded energy drink that takes aim at that surging market. Coke\u2019s new energy drink has already debuted in 25 European countries.\n\nAnd of course, it has meant pulling the trigger on the $5.1 billion acquisition of Costa Coffee in 2018 to more aggressively pursue the popular java category.\n\nWhile Quincey has remained reluctant to get into the unproven CBD beverage space \u2014 and snacks to compete with heated rival PepsiCo\u2019s Frito Lay division \u2014 his \u201ctotal beverage company\u201d rallying cry continues to be embraced by investors. In large part, that\u2019s because the efforts to cater to growing consumer demands are showing up favorably in the company\u2019s quarterly earnings results.\n\nCoke reported Friday that third-quarter earnings came in at 56 cents a share, in line with Wall Street forecasts. Revenue tallied $9.5 billion versus the $9.4 billion consensus estimate, fueled by strength globally in zero sugar options, juice and water. The beverage giant slightly raised its full organic sales growth guidance to 5%. It reiterated its full-year earnings per share guidance for a decline of 1% to an increase of 1%.\n\nDow component Coke\u2019s stock rose about 3% on the news. The stock has gained 21% the past year, compared with an 8% increase for the S&P 500 and a 6% pop for the Dow.\n\nWall Street remains impressed with Quincey\u2019s pursuit of beverage innovation.\n\n\u201cCEO James Quincey, in our assessment, remains highly aggressive in his approach to building a total beverage company,\u201d says veteran Guggenheim Securities beverage analyst Laurent Grandet. \u201cToday\u2019s 3Q results provide yet another quarter of evidence that Coca-Cola\u2019s strategy to drive top-line growth is working and gaining momentum.\u201d\n\nGrandet expects Coke\u2019s energy drinks to pull in a cool $200 million in sales next year.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
