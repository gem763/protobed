The politician then regained consciousness and was chatting after his impromptu dive into the front row, but the full extent of the damage to his reputation has yet to be assessed.\n\nder sturz des Altmaier...\n\n\n\nWELCH EIN \"SYMBOLBILD\" pic.twitter.com/tujxx0cdTG \u2014 FalkderBoese\ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@FalkderBoeseG7) October 29, 2019\n\nThe minister\u2019s unfortunate stumble came after concluding his remarks on a proposal for cloud-based data storage. He has thanked medics from the event who treated him and he is now recovering in hospital.\n\nA doctor in the audience reportedly rushed to treat the stricken speaker. TV footage showed the 61-year-old stepping down from the podium at the end of his speech. The feed then cut to the audience applauding, before they gasped and their hands went to their mouths at the sight of his fall.\n\nDortmund'daki konferansta konu\u015fmas\u0131n\u0131 yapt\u0131ktan sonra yerine ge\u00e7mek isteyen Almanya Enerji ve Ekonomi Bakan\u0131 Peter Altmaier, t\u00f6kezleyerek d\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc.
