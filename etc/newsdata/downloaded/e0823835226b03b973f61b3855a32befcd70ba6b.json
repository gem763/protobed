Instead I was lighting one in his memory.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ashamed of the Greek police. They are not doing their job. Any decent human being would want to find my son for me and to give closure to me and closure to the island.\u201d\n\n(Image: MDM)\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nThen aged just 21 months, Ben vanished on July 24 1991, on Kos, when he was with his grandparents while Kerry worked.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police have carried out two searches in Kos, the first was in 2012, when a mound of earth in front of the farmhouse where Ben was last seen playing was searched.\n\nAfter a witness came forward and told them they believe Ben was killed in an accident, a second dig was arranged behind the property in 2016.\n\n(Image: MDM)\n\nSoil containing decomposed blood was found in the area where late digger driver, Konstantinos Barkas, known as Dino, was operating.\n\nKerry said an elderly witness told a British police boss how they spoke to Dino the morning after Ben vanished.\n\nHe was shaking and sweating and when he asked Dino if there had been an accident, he said: \u201cYes it\u2019s possible. I heard a yelp but I thought it was a dog.\u201d\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nIntensive searches of the site only found a toy car thought to be Ben\u2019s and part of his leather sandal.\n\nTraces of DNA from a decomposed body were found in the car but it was not a match for Ben.\n\n\u201cThe new prosecutor on Kos has been given South Yorkshire Police\u2019s report. We\u2019ve heard nothing,\u201d said Kerry, 46, from Sheffield.\n\nShe added: \u201cWe haven\u2019t even got a grave to go to. It\u2019s so unfair.\u201d\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police confirmed a file has been passed to the Greek authorities and they were waiting for a meeting with the new prosecutor.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Kerry Needham accused Greek police of \u201cignoring\u201d a file handed over by British police who believe toddler Ben died in a horror digger accident", "authors": ["Lucy Thornton", "Image", "Pa", "Mdm", "Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20758250.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Ben-Needham-missing.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
