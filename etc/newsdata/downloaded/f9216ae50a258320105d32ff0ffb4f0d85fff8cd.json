An additional report from Deadline suggested that Pattinson was Reeves\u2019 preferred choice, but Warner Bros. executives weren\u2019t entirely sold. The \u201cstudio was torn between him and Nicholas Hoult,\u201d according to Deadline. Batman is a crucial franchise for Warner Bros., and the studio didn\u2019t want to jeopardize it. There is a chance that The Batman could turn into a mini-franchise of its own, according to Deadline, with the supposed contract set to \u201cinclude options on at least two more films.\u201d\n\nPattinson is best known for his work as the vampire Edward Cullen in the Twilight franchise, but he\u2019s since established himself as an indie darling. He\u2019s received critical acclaim for his work in movies like David Cronenberg\u2019s Cosmopolis, Claire Denis\u2019 High Life, and the Safdie brothers\u2019 2017 film Good Time. Pattinson\u2019s decision to join The Batman is surprising since the actor has previously said he\u2019s \u201ccautious\u201d about entering more franchises after working on Twilight. But The Batman may be the perfect answer.\n\n\u201cThe only reason why I\u2019m cautious about big franchise things is you can\u2019t make them \u2018R rated,\u2019\u201d Pattinson said at the Berlin Film Festival in 2018.\n\nReeves described the film as a return to what Christopher Nolan did with his Dark Knight trilogy. It\u2019s a different version than Ben Affleck\u2019s take on the character from Justice League and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and the interpretation of director Zack Snyder, who remains convinced that Batman is an unrepentant murderer.\n\nThe Batman is currently scheduled for theatrical release in 2021.", "description": "Robert Pattinson, best known for his work in Twilight, is Warner Bros.\u2019 new Batman.
