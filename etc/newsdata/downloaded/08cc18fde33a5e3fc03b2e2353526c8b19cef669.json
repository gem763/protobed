Reports suggest a partial deal may not happen as China mulls to cut its visit to the US short, which led to , bonds, , all bought up, then a headlines emerged that the US may consider a 'currency accord' with China, leading to a V-shaped reversal day so far...\n\nQuick Take\n\nIt's all about the US-China trade outcome, with the erratic swings in currencies a testament of how unpredictable trading around these high-stake events can be. The latest we've learnt reflects the confusion and state of uncertainty. On one hand, reports suggest that the US and China made no progress on key trade issues, leading to speculation that the Chinese delegation will cut the trip short to just one day of meeting with their US counterparts. On the the other hand, a report via Bloomberg said the US is considering a currency agreement with China. The instruments most intertwined with risk aversion (Gold, bonds, Yen, Swissy) caught a solid bid ahead of the Tokyo open before an epic reversal, while the likes of the or the were marked down only to fly higher on the speculation of a currency accord. Meanwhile, in the Brexit saga, the usual dose of algo-led volatility in the was observed, although the net result was an acceptance of lower levels, prove that the market is not buying into a resolution of the Brexit conundrum. The USD put on a combatant performance to reverse its early losses on Wednesday, even if it's now under some pressure. The broke higher on Wed.\n\nGlobal FX\n\nThe indices show the performance of a particular currency vs G8 FX.

The markets were in full risk-off in early Asia as a report via the South China Morning Post revealed that the US and China made no progress on key trade issues in two days of deputy-level talks, according to sources. What\u2019s worse, as the report notes, \u201cthe high-level talks are expected to last for only one day, with Liu He and his team now planning to leave Washington on Thursday.\u201d This negative sentiment was later reversed. Read on...\n\nHigh level trade talks start officially today: China\u2019s Vice Premier Liu He will be leading the Chinese delegation. Ahead of the report by the SCMP, there had been tentative evidence that China was willing to make a partial deal that would include buying more agricultural products, although leaving no room for negotiation in other sensitive issues the US had complained about such as the protection of intellectual property and or reduction in government subsidies for public firms.\n\nTurnaround on talk of currency accord... According to Bloomberg, the White House is looking at rolling out a previously agreed currency pact with China as part of an early partial deal that could also see a tariff increase next week suspended, according to people familiar with the discussions. The currency accord -- which the U.S. said had been agreed to earlier this year before trade talks broke down -- would be part of what the White House considers to be a first-phase agreement with Beijing. It would be followed by more negotiations on core issues like intellectual property and forced technology transfers, the people said.\n\nViolent rotations in risk assets: The immediate reaction in financial markets amid the realization that a partial deal may not happen was to buy the assets most intertwined with risk aversion (Gold, bonds, Yen, Swissy), while the likes of the Oceanic currencies, especially the Aussie, were the most punished in thin liquidity Asian markets. These moves were fully reversed after the news broke out that the US is considering a 'currency pact'.\n\nFed minutes a non-event: The Fed , while not a market mover due to its redundancy after new relevant fundamental data not taken into account in the last meeting, it nonetheless left a sense that the Central Bank is growing more concerned over downside risk from slowing global growth, the ongoing strides in the trade war and depressed inflationary pressures. A debate on when to stop the easing cycle also emerged this time, while it as revealed that several members were keen on keeping rates unchanged in the last meeting, in other words, there were more dissenters in theory than previously thought, which means the support to keep easing has shrunk.\n\nSellers lurk around in the Sterling: The saw an ephemeral spike before coming back down after a report from The Times speculated that the EU was mulling to make some concessions by which a mechanism for Northern Ireland to leave the Irish backstop would be set up after a number of years. However, an unnamed EU official dismissed the report by noting \"no bold new offer is coming\". The Guardian's Brussels correspondent, Jennifer Rankin, added that \u201cthe EU is *not* about to make a big bold offer to allow Stormont to exit part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement\u2026\u201d\n\nTurkey launches offensive against Syria: In the words of Turkish President Erdogan, the attack is aimed to eliminate the 'terror corridor', bringing peace and stability to the region. Trump said that the US does not endorse the attack on Syria, reiterating that \u201cany unforced or unnecessary fighting by Turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency. We are helping the Kurds financially/weapons!.\u201d The Turkish Lira has been under continuous sell-side pressure as the geopolitical tensions escalate.\n\nRecent Economic Indicators & Events Ahead\n\nCalendar\n\nCalendar\n\nSource: Forexfactory\n\nA Dive Into The FX Indices Charts\n\nThe indices show the performance of a particular currency vs G8 FX. An educational video on how to interpret these indices can be found in the Global Prime's Research section.\n\nThe EUR index made further strides by violating a tough level of resistance in the hourly, finally allowing for a fresh upcycle to be formed in the hourly, with the next target now seen over 0.20% higher, where a daily level of resistance and the 100% proj target intersect. In early Asia, we\u2019ve already seen a touch and go from the backside on the breakout point, proving that the analysis of indices as a technical aid to assist in entering positions based on the aggregate flows of the EUR vs G8 FX holds great value for the avid trader willing to put in the work by patiently awaiting to engage in these areas where a decision will be made.\n\nEuro\n\nThe GBP index stopped in its tracks at exactly the 100% proj target based on the latest swing breakout, with the predictive nature of selecting the right levels to act as reactionary areas still keeping those following these analysis on the right side of the market. As anticipated, a fresh retest of the broken daily support led to an abrupt rejection of the index, returning back down prior to an acceptance of lower levels for the remainder of the day. This is a bearish admission by the market. Note, there are no longer fresh levels nearby, both the backside retest of the breakout point and the 100% proj target partially consumed in the last 24h. Still, in the grand scheme of things, the market clearly exhibits a bearish structure, with a more macro projection based on the always reliable 100% target over 0.6% lower from Wed\u2019s NY close.\n\nGBP\n\nThe USD index keeps printing higher highs and higher lows, and with it, building up expectations that further increases in the valuation of the currency lie on the horizon. For today, there are two critical areas to engage in long-side business, the most immediate one includes a level of hourly support recently acting as a magnet to attract and reject prices. Further down, if a setback in the USD takes us down all the way to the prior swing low, it would represent a potentially great area to reinstate longs as it aligns not only with an 8h horizontal support, but the 13d ema comes at the very same level, strengthening the case to see a cluster of bids. On the way up, there aren\u2019t any levels of resistance catching my attention for now.\n\nUSD\n\nThe CAD index has been treading water going nowhere fast this week as the focus is elsewhere. The fact that we haven\u2019t had any major data releases out of Canada is not helping either. The index, as it was the case yesterday, remains encapsulated right in the middle of a range, between a level of resistance and another of support, both identified via the 8h chart. Drilling down into the hourly chart involves getting into a rather rough sea of erratic fluctuations, so I suggest to stick with the outer levels as the cleanest areas to find opportunities.\n\nCAD\n\nThe NZD index has transitioned into a bearish structure in the hourly, which implies selling rebounds should dominate proceedings intraday. A retest of the breakout point is happening as I type, with plenty of leeway for sellers to exploit the technicals until the 100% proj target is met over 0.4% lower, allowing for the anticipation of a solid risk reward. Right before the 100% proj is potentially visited, a level of support off the 8h chart may also act as an early reactionary point in the chart since the last 8h swing achieved a full rotation back up. Should the NZD muster enough strength to recover its losses, a level of 8h resistance lies on top as well.\n\nNZD\n\nThe AUD index managed to violate a series of lows acting as support for the index in recent days, finally opening the doors for the market to potentially transition into lower levels. The retest of the broken support level has led to an immediate resumption of the downtrend, which if it were to pick up further momentum, has as first target the 100% projection as depicted in magenta line in the chart, followed by an hourly level of support further down. Even if the AUD keeps challenging higher levels from here, the cluster of levels overhead, alongside the bearish structure, makes the currency a clear candidate to depreciate further heading into week-end.\n\nAUD\n\nThe JPY index found strong bids at the intersection of the 13-day ema in early Europe on Wednesday, which coincided with an hourly support as per the impulsive departure of price the prior day. The follow through demand seen in early Asia this Thursday keeps playing into the view that this is a market with risks skewed towards the upside in line with the bullish structure in higher time frames. Unless the trade rhetoric in the US-China talks goes through a U-turn, buying on dips for an eventual breakout of the recent highs is a scenario to account for.\n\nJPY\n\nThe CHF index has printed a marginal new high, and what this does to the technical outlook is to create, based on market structure analysis, greater expectations that the current pullback will be bought up at areas of interest as the ones outlined in the chart below. That\u2019s where the highest concentration of bids should reside for an eventual resumption of the uptrend. There tends to be a substantial amount of buyside interest when the origin of a demand is retested as it seems it will be the case with the Swissy index, hence why all else equal, this is a market where expectations for higher levels in line with a constructive hourly structure may ensue.\n\nCHF\n\nImportant Footnotes", "description": "Forex Analysis by Ivan Delgado covering: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CHF.
