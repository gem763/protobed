However, more than half of those visitors, 32 million, arrived within the first four years of the opening.\n\nLesson plans for teachers preparing their students for visits to the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York explore the day\u2019s events, its repercussions and first responders.\n\nKindergartners to second-graders are asked, \u201cWhat do you wonder about the towers?\u201d They are told about French artist Philippe Petit, who walked on a high wire between the twin towers in 1974.\n\nHigh school lesson plans ask students to explore Afghan literature and engage in discussions about airport security versus civil liberties.\n\nAcross the Potomac River from Washington, where 184 were killed when a jetliner struck the west side of the Department of Defense headquarters, the benches of the National 9/11 Pentagon Memorial closed Monday to begin repairs to the site. The gateway to the memorial will close from Nov. 16 until next year.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the impact that this closure will have on family members and visitors to the Pentagon Memorial,\u201d officials said in the release. \u201cEvery effort has been made to develop a construction plan that will enable the work to be completed in a quick and efficient manner, reducing site closure time.\u201d\n\nThe repairs will address water damage and the electrical system, including lights for the benches.\n\nCongress and President Trump in July approved the extension of the James Zadroga compensation fund, which pays for treatment of illnesses suffered by the first responders and survivors of the attacks.\n\nMany rescue and recovery workers developed latent respiratory and digestive ailments linked to toxic dust at ground zero. Other illnesses, including cancer, have been diagnosed.\n\nMichael Barasch, a New York injury lawyer who has represented thousands of 9/11 victims, told The Washington Times last week that the rates of cancers and other health issues linked to the toxic dust is \u201castronomical and frightening.\u201d\n\nAccording to the World Trade Center health program, more than 2,300 cancer deaths have been linked to 9/11 toxins. More than 10,000 people also have developed cancer from the aftermath of the terrorist attacks.\n\nAll in all, Mr. Barasch said, an estimated 400,000 people were affected by 9/11.\n\n\u201cSurvivors are the forgotten victims,\u201d he said.\n\nResearch continues into whether those illnesses are tied to 9/11 toxins. A 2018 study did not find higher than normal death rates overall among people exposed to the dust and smoke, but researchers have noted more deaths than expected from brain cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and certain other diseases. The number of suicides among rescue and recovery workers also is unusual.\n\nStudies have suggested that highly exposed workers may face more problems, including somewhat higher death rates and a modestly higher risk of heart trouble, than less-exposed colleagues.\n\nMore than 51,000 people have applied to a victims compensation fund that makes payments to people with illnesses potentially related to 9/11. The fund has awarded over $5.5 billion so far. There also is a push to configure names of first responders victimized by the thick clouds of smoke and fires that burned for months in the rubble.\n\nWith growing attention to the deaths of ailing 9/11 rescue, recovery and cleanup workers, some memorials elsewhere began adding their names, The Associated Press reported. A remembrance wall to them was dedicated in 2011 in Nesconset, New York.\n\nBut the trade center memorial has a \u201cresponsibility \u2014 especially where it\u2019s located, on sacred ground \u2014 to continue to tell the story,\u201d said John Feal, who lost part of a foot while working as a demolition supervisor there and later founded a charity that maintains the Nesconset memorial, the AP reported.\n\nIn addition the names of nearly 3,000 Sept. 11 victims, a half dozen stacks of stone will quietly salute an untold number of people who aren\u2019t on the list.\n\nThe granite slabs were installed on the memorial plaza this spring. They recognize firefighters, police and others who died or fell ill after exposure to toxins unleashed in the wreckage. Officials say names will be added as the aftermath of 9/11 continues to evolve, the AP reported.\n\n\u2981 Shen Wu Tan contributed to this article, which is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
