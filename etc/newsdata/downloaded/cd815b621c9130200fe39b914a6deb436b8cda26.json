Fitch Downgrades Jain Irrigation to 'RD' on Bank Loan Default; Off RWN\n\n(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Singapore/Mumbai-October 16: Fitch Ratings has downgraded India-based micro-irrigation company Jain Irrigation (NS: ) Systems Limited's (JISL) Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) to 'RD' from 'CCC-' and the rating on its USD200 million 7.125% senior unsecured notes due in 2022 to 'C' from 'CCC-' with a Recovery Rating of 'RR4'. The downgrade follows JISL's uncured payment default on working capital debt, following which the lenders are pursuing an out-of-court debt resolution process. All ratings have been removed from Rating Watch Negative (RWN), on which they were placed on 21 June 2019. The notes are issued by JISL's wholly owned subsidiary, Jain International Trading B.V., and guaranteed by JISL. KEY RATING DRIVERS Uncured Payment Default: JISL informed Fitch that it failed to meet debt service commitments on its working capital facilities in India with delays of between 60 to 90 days in some cases. JISL's working capital lenders have signed an inter-creditor agreement (ICA) whereby the lenders introduce policies for the resolution of stressed assets under the Indian Regulatory Framework. Fitch's understanding is that lenders are pursuing an out-of-court process to formulate a debt resolution plan by early January 2020. High Risk of Insolvency Proceedings: JISL faces formal insolvency proceedings if its liquidity position does not improve and lenders initiate legal proceedings upon the failure of the debt resolution efforts. The ICA dated 5 July 2019 signed by the Indian working capital lenders has a review period of 180 days, in accordance with Reserve Bank of India regulations. The lenders have appointed Brescon to work on a resolution plan. Nonetheless, we believe the risk of insolvency is high, considering uncertainty around the timing of collection of overdue government receivables. JISL's access to new debt capital is poor in our view, considering the default on its working capital debt and signing of the ICA. JISL is exploring the sale of minority stakes in some of its businesses to reduce debt. It is highly uncertain if JISL can achieve it in a timely manner to avoid insolvency proceedings. Cross Default with Notes: We believe the non-payment on the working capital facilities may have triggered an event of default on the notes. Under the bond indenture, an event of default occurs if JISL, which is the guarantor for the notes, fails to pay principal on any debt following a grace period, with an outstanding principal of more than USD15 million. The bond trustee or 25% of the noteholders can declare the principal immediately due and payable. Overdue Receivables Causing Liquidity Squeeze: Fitch believes that further delays in the recovery of receivables from government customers in its micro-irrigation systems (MIS) projects business coupled with a weak sales momentum in the six months to 30 September 2019 (1HFY20) led to the liquidity squeeze. JISL indicated that its liquidity has reduced to INR1.5 billion - with all working capital lines fully drawn in India - from INR11.9 billion at FYE19. JISL collected a further INR1.5 billion of overdue government receivables since July 2019, but fresh delays caused the total of overdue government receivables to rise to INR14 billion. We expect the delayed start but prolonged monsoon season to have hit the trading performance of retail segment of MIS business in 1HFY20. Enlarged receivables in MIS projects business are likely to reduce the pace of execution in 2HFY20, in our view. DERIVATION SUMMARY JISL's IDR has been downgraded to 'RD' as our definition of the rating is uncured payment default but no initiation of bankruptcy filings administration, receivership, liquidation, or other formal winding-up procedure yet and continuity of business operations. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Recovery Rating Assumptions - The recovery analysis assumes that JISL would be considered a going-concern in bankruptcy and that the company would be reorganised rather than liquidated. We have assumed a 10% administrative claim. - We have assumed that JISL's going-concern EBITDA is equal to its EBITDA in FY19 with no further discount applied. It reflects Fitch's view of a sustainable, post-reorganisation EBITDA level, upon which we based the valuation of the company. - An enterprise value (EV)/EBITDA multiple of 5.0x is used to calculate the post-reorganisation valuation and we believe this is closer to a distressed multiple, considering that as of 1 October 2019, with its stock price at multi-year lows, JISL was trading at a EV/EBITDA multiple of about 5.4x. - We used secured and unsecured debt as of 31 March 2019. The compulsory convertible debentures, USD200 million bonds issued by Jain International Trading B.V., vendor financing in trade-payables reclassified as debt, and the foreign-currency convertible bonds are treated as unsecured debt. - We have assumed that JISL's sanctioned but undrawn lines of INR10.8 billion as of 31 March 2019 will be fully drawn at the point of distress, and that these lenders would have a prior ranking claim on JISL's assets ahead of bond investors. - The recovery waterfall results in recovery rate estimate corresponding to a Recovery Rating of 'RR4' for the USD200 million unsecured notes. RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - Fitch would reassess the company's credit profile following the completion of a successful debt restructuring. Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - The IDR will be downgraded to 'D' if JISL enters into bankruptcy proceedings, administration, receivership, liquidation or other formal winding-up procedure or if it ceases operations. LIQUIDITY Insolvent: Fitch believes JISL does not have the funds to meet its immediate debt-servicing obligations and the company's access to new capital is poor.

JISL has an ESG Relevance Score of '4' for Management Strategy due to the management's aggressive approach to managing working capital and liquidity, which has a negative impact on the credit profile, and is relevant to the rating in conjunction with other factors. JISL has an ESG Relevance Score of '5' for Financial Transparency due to the lack of timely and adequate disclosures, which have a negative impact on the company's credit profile and is highly relevant to the rating. For more information on our ESG Relevance Scores, visit www.fitchratings.com/esg. Summary of Financial Statement Adjustments - The full value of JISL's compulsory convertible debentures is treated as debt - JISL extends a corporate guarantee of up to INR1 billion on the debt of its associate Sustainable Agro-Commercial Finance Limited, which we include as off-balance-sheet debt when calculating leverage. - JISL includes vendor financing as part of its trade payables. However we have removed this from payables and treated it as debt as it extends JISL's normal working capital cycle significantly. Vendor financing amounted to INR1.9 billion and INR2.0 billion, respectively, for FY18 and FY19. - We have excluded INR1 billion from JISL's reported year-end cash to account for a typically lower cash balance during other fiscal quarters.
