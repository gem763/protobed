A second match between the two Koreas is scheduled for June 4 next year, though the venue for that game has yet to be decided.With Tuesday\u2019s match marking the first time the Koreas have faced each other in Pyongyang in 29 years, South Korea has been trying since last month to make it an occasion to advance bilateral ties amid the ongoing strain brought on by faltering denuclearization negotiations.The North has ignored Seoul\u2019s repeated requests to send a cheerleading squad and for permission for the South\u2019s national football team to fly directly from Incheon International Airport to Pyongyang, a journey that would take around 40 minutes by air. Instead, according to a source in the South Korean government, the team is set to fly on Sunday to Beijing, where they will need to acquire visas from the North Korean Embassy in China before flying via the North\u2019s official Koryo Airlines or a Chinese carrier into Pyongyang for Tuesday\u2019s game.The entire process is estimated to take around two days, given the time that it normally takes to issue North Korean visas. The Unification Ministry official said this would likely mean the players would have to stay in China overnight, since there are no flights from Beijing to Pyongyang on Sunday.Perhaps more concerning for South Korean fans, however, is Pyongyang\u2019s silence on the issue of broadcasting.In terms of broadcasting rights, it is likely that South Koreans will not be able to watch a live feed of their team\u2019s match with the North. According to the Unification Ministry, broadcasting rights for final qualifying matches are held by the Asian Football Confederation, but host countries hold the broadcasting rights for regional qualification matches like Tuesday\u2019s.North Korea did not broadcast its earlier match in Pyongyang with Lebanon held on Sept. 5, which it won 2-0, choosing instead to publish photographs of the game the following day. This, and the fact that it hasn\u2019t replied to requests by South Korean broadcasters, suggests it is unlikely next Tuesday\u2019s match will be televised.The star player on South Korea\u2019s national football team, Son Heung-min, addressed some of the concerns surrounding the match when asked by reporters on Monday. \u201cThere is nothing we can do and it is best that we quickly accept [the situation],\u201d Son said. \u201cWe are not tourists and will have no time to see things in North Korea. As a player on the national team, I will only think about the game.\u201dBY SHIM KYU-SEOK, BAEK MIN-JEONG [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
