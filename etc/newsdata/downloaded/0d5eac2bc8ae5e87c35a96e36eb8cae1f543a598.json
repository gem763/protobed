They haunt everything from riverways to misty mountains to city streets.\n\nDating back to the early eighth century, these dastardly spirits first appeared in the Kojiki (\u53e4\u4e8b\u8a18, \u201cRecords of Ancient Matters\u201d) which is the earliest record of Japanese mythology, chronicling the creation of Japan.\n\nYurei and yokai have since appeared in Japanese traditional art like ukiyo-e (woodblock carvings) throughout the ages. Some are seen as pop-culture icons, such as in the manga-turned anime Gegege no Kitaro in which all the characters are some form of yokai. If you\u2019re brave enough, you can visit Gegege no Kitaro and his yokai friends in the manga kingdom of Tottori.\n\nKeep an eye out for these ghostly spirits in Japan this Halloween.\n\n1. Kuchisake Onna: A murderous woman with a hellish, gaping mouth\n\nKuchisake Onna is a malicious, contemporary yurei, whose name literally translates to \u201cslit-mouthed woman.\u201d Legend says when she was alive, her husband punished her for her acts of adultery by slicing her mouth open from ear to ear.\n\nDidn\u2019t your mother ever tell you it\u2019s rude to stare?\n\nHer ghost appears as a beautiful young woman wearing a surgical mask, holding a sharp weapon like a pair of scissors. She approaches people at night and asks them a question with sinister intentions.\n\n\u201cWatashi, kirei?\u201d or \u201cAm I beautiful?\u201d she coos. If you answer no, she will kill you instantly. If you say yes, she removes the surgical mask revealing her gruesome mouth. With a big smile, exposing sharp teeth, she\u2019ll ask, \u201chow about now.\u201d\n\nAn encounter with a kuchisake onna is a lose-lose situation, always resulting in death.\n\nAn answer of no will result in you being dismembered by the ghost. Say yes, and she will make you as \u201cbeautiful\u201d as she is by slicing your own mouth from ear to ear. An encounter with a kuchisake onna is a lose-lose situation, always resulting in death.\n\nThis murderous ghost was a character in the 1984 Studio Ghibli movie Pom Poko and several Japanese horror movies have been made with her story as the premise, including the 2007 low-budget horror flick Carved: The Slit-Mouthed Woman.\n\n2. Yuki Onna: The deceptive snow beauty\n\nEver seen a beautiful woman with snow-white skin and long black hair wandering through the frigid winter? It may have been a yuki onna, or snow woman. When she walks along a snow-covered terrain, you won\u2019t find any footprints behind her.\n\nFrom the 1866 movie The Snow Woman (\u602a\u8ac7\u96ea\u5973\u90ce) by Tokuzo Tanaka.\n\nThe majority of yuki onna stories originate from Japan\u2019s snowy, northern prefectures like Aomori and Akita in the Tohoku region. In some versions, she is a snow vampire who sucks the souls out of her victims. In other versions, she uses her supernatural beauty to lure weak-willed men into the cold, then leaves them to freeze to death. Savage.\n\nSome say the yuki onna was a beautiful woman who was murdered in the snow and now does the same to others as an act of revenge.\n\nThankfully, Halloween is in October and the koyo (autumn leaves) season will be late this year so she won\u2019t be making an appearance at least until Christmas.\n\n3. Chochin Obake: A mischievous paper lantern ghost\n\nThis lantern ghost isn\u2019t malicious like many other yokai\u2014he\u2019s just a naughty little trickster who enjoys giving humans a scare. The chochin obake will flick its large tongue out, roll its eyes, and laugh loudly to frighten passers-by.\n\nHe looks so sad. It\u2019s no wonder really.\n\nAccording to the legends, a regular lantern may turn into this yokai after 100 years of use. This comes from the ancient Shinto religious belief that all objects\u2014even inanimate ones\u2014have a soul.\n\nMaybe don\u2019t visit any temples, izakaya or other places likely to have lanterns this Halloween if you don\u2019t want to run into one.\n\n4. Jorogumo: The carnivorous spider\n\nThis seductive spider ghost is based on the real golden-orb weaver spider, which is found all around Japan. The female of this spider grows to be 2.5 cm long, and can even catch small birds as prey\u2014it\u2019s a real thing of nightmares.\n\nLegend says when a spider reaches 400 years old, she will transform into a jorogumo and develop an appetite for eating young men instead of boring bugs and birds. Jorogumo are often depicted as beautiful women with the legs of a spider, surrounded by the skeletons of previous victims.\n\nA golden orb spider before her 400th birthday.\n\nThey use their alluring human form to seduce young men back to their homes, trapping them in their webs and devouring them slowly.\n\n5. Gashadokuro: A motley crew of skeletons\n\nThe poor, unfortunate bones of those who\u2019ve perished on the battlefield turn into gashadokuro. These yokai form in places where masses of normal skeletons lie, such as in villages after famine or disease has wiped out the population. Lacking a proper burial, the souls and bones come together and create one big skeleton, 15 times the size of a normal person.\n\nThe famous Japanese painting, Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre.\n\nYou may have seen this yokai in the famous ukiyoe \u201cTakiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre\u201d which has been printed onto postcards, cloth flags, and t-shirts since it\u2019s creation in 1844.\n\nThe skeleton specters feed on lone travelers, biting their heads off, feasting on their bones, and drinking their blood, Dracula-style.\n\n6. Yama Uba: Children-eating mountain hags\n\n\u201cYama Uba\u201d from The Illustrated Volume of a Hundred Demons by Sawaki Suushi.\n\nPlanning on hiking in the mountains this fall? You may want to rethink that, as that\u2019s where you\u2019ll find the yama uba.\n\nHide your kids, hide your wife, cause yama uba are kidnapping everybody out here.\n\nThese decrepit hags, depicted as old women with disheveled hair and filthy kimonos, are known to offer shelter to weary travelers only to kill them once they fall asleep. If you decide to go hiking anyway and happen to find an old hut along your hiking trail, just stay away from it.\n\nHide your kids, hide your wife, cause yama uba are kidnapping everybody out here. This tall tale is a popular bedtime story for parents to tell disobedient children.\n\n7. Kappa: Quirky river demons\n\nNo list of Japanese yurei and yokai is complete without the kappa, a yokai deeply imbedded in Japanese religion, history, and culture. There\u2019s even a sushi roll named after him\u2014the kappa-maki, or cucumber roll.\n\nKappa\u2019s love cucumbers. What strange little things they are.\n\nThis small human-like creature has a shell like a turtle, green scaly skin, and a plate on its head that must be filled with water at all times to stay alive. They live in Japan\u2019s rivers, lakes, and other waterways.\n\nIn Shintoism, kappa are respected as gods of water and statues of them can sometimes be seen at shrines around Japan. Kappa quirks include having an affinity for cucumbers (hence the kappa-maki) and never being able to break a promise.\n\nA more menacing kappa, the urban legend version, loves to pull lost children and animals into the water to drown and eat. They still like to eat cucumbers, but also raw human intestines.\n\nDon\u2019t step too close to the water.\n\nHave you ever encountered something strange you can\u2019t explain?
