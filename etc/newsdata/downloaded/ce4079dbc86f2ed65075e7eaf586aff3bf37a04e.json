He experimented with vaping off and on for about five years, but now he says he\u2019s quit for good. (Charles Contant/CBC)\n\nTyler said it\u2019s hard to tell if other students at his school, John Abbott College, are taking the warnings about vaping seriously.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to pinpoint where we\u2019re at,\u201d he said, but in general \u201cpeople don\u2019t listen until it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Tyler said he\u2019s happy to put vaping behind him for good \u2014 and to speak out about why he quit.\n\n\u201cI am never touching a vape again. That\u2019s 100 per cent for sure.\u201d\n\nThere have been hundreds of severe respiratory illnesses linked to vaping in the U.S., but experts are calling this a first for Canada.
