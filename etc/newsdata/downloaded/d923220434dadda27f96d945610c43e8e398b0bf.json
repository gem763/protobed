The day after the referendum, it plunged and inflation has risen sharply ever since as we pay more for imported goods.\n\nLast June, it was 0.8 per cent and last month it was 2.6 per cent with Bank of England governor Mark Carney saying the \u2018big picture\u2019 for inflation remains the same despite a slight fall last month.\n\nPrices have risen since the referendum on Brexit last year and as we report below there is more to come with package holidays set to cost us all more, too\n\nBut inflation is not the same for everyone and looking at how it affects different groups is key to navigating the currents driving political events.\n\nStephen Clarke of the Resolution Foundation think-tank, chaired by former Tory Cabinet Minister David Willetts, has published an analysis on this topic.\n\n\u2018Lower income households spend proportionately more on housing, food and drinks and have therefore experienced higher inflation since the turn of the year. The poorest 10 per cent of households experienced inflation of 2 per cent, by contrast the richest 10 per cent of households experienced inflation of 1.8 per cent,\u2019 wrote Clarke.\n\nHe also noted that: \u2018Between the middle of 2013 and mid-2014 inflation fell from 2.9 to 1.9 per cent. However, over that period the poorest fifth of households only saw their inflation rate fall from 3.1 to 2.3 per cent.\u2019\n\nThese differences might not sound much but when every penny counts, they hurt.\n\nThey also account, perhaps, for what happened in the General Election, when the Tories with their long - held mantra of \u2018We\u2019re all in it together\u2019 got a shock.\n\nThere have even been suggestions that some Tory MPs privately concede that Jeremy Corbyn has a point \u2013 that privatisation, for example, has simply made a few people rich while the rest of us pay more for a worse service.\n\nThe BBC has form when it comes to overpaying \u2013 not on-air talent, but its own executives. Former director general Mark Thompson paid \u00a325 million to 150 outgoing senior executives \u2013 millions more than their contracts entitled them to.\n\nI always admired one of them, Roly Keating, who went on to run the British Library and was the only one to give back his payment \u2018as a matter of principle\u2019 because he felt it was wrong to accept something which could not be shown to have been properly authorised. Perhaps today\u2019s overpaid \u2018talent\u2019 might wish to emulate Mr Keating\u2019s example on the grounds of sheer excess.", "description": "Prices have risen since the referendum on Brexit last year and as we report below there is more to come with package holidays set to cost us all more, too, writes Jon Rees.", "authors": ["Jon Rees", "Financial Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
