For day one this season, I\u2019m starting at 8.15am.\n\nThe days can be long and late depending on the fashion team\u2019s stamina. It\u2019s not just the catwalk shows, the VIP parties are also prolific and part of the job is to be seen at the right events.\n\nI usually finish after midnight, but as most fashion editors have Milan and Paris Fashion Weeks still to come, they pace themselves. But not always. I keep a supply of water and snacks to make sure they carb up for the longer days.\n\nDo you normally pick editors up from their homes?\n\nGenerally that works best for an editor, especially if it\u2019s a very early start. They want to arrive in style and make sure they\u2019re looking their best, that isn\u2019t going to happen if they have to get the Tube and there\u2019s a downpour. They prefer to use the car hotspot to check their emails, catch up on what\u2019s happening for the show schedule as well as do their make-up.\n\nWhat do you do while you wait for editors between shows?\n\nWhile we are waiting to pick people up, we chat to the other drivers as generally we all know each other having worked on LFW for years. Before that, we check the schedule to see if there are any changes for the next show and also if there are any traffic incidents. We can get directions, make calls, send and receive messages as well as enjoy a playlist or two.\n\nWhat\u2019s the strangest request you\u2019ve had from someone you\u2019ve driven at LFW?\n\nI have had many strange requests but they may not be printable; what goes on in our car stays in our car. Although I have had many passengers insist on me taking their preferred routes, which can result in two-hour long delays sometimes! It\u2019s best to leave the driving up to us...\n\nWho is the most famous person you\u2019ve ever driven at LFW?\n\nI have driven pretty much all of the top fashion editors in my time as well as A-list actresses, actors and singers. Most are completely charming and chatty.\n\nDo you learn about the fashion industry when you\u2019re driving people?\n\nWe might get the odd snippet but mostly we are too focused on what we are doing to tune in.\n\nWhat is your favourite thing about fashion today?\n\nI\u2019m afraid I know more about A roads than A-line skirts. You\u2019ve only got to look at me to see I\u2019m not very fashionable.\n\nHow did you go from being a policeman to a Fashion Week driver?\n\nI left the police force in 2010 and thought that because I enjoyed driving, I would take a look around and see what work was on offer. Then I found the company I work at now, Parkers, and have been there ever since. It\u2019s much less stressful than being a policeman: the people I have in the back of my car now don\u2019t want to kill me.\n\nWhat do you like about the car you are driving this LFW?\n\nI love driving Volvos. For a long day, they are the most comfortable \u2013 and some of the interiors in the XC40 models are made from recycled plastic bottles.", "description": "London Fashion Week is the busiest time of year for those working in the industry.
