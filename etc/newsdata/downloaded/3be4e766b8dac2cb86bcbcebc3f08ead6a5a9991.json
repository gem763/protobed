Asked two years ago whether he wanted a peerage, Mr Farage replied: 'Nope, wouldn't want one at all. I would not want a peerage \u2013 if something else came along I might accept it.'\n\nIn 2016, contenders to replace him as head of Ukip all said they would campaign to get him a seat on the famous red benches if they won.\n\nMr Farage replied that 'it will never happen'.\n\nLast night, he was unavailable for comment.", "description": "Nigel Farage was approached by a 'middle man' to sound him out over accepting a peerage from the Government, it was claimed last night.", "authors": ["Brendan Carlin For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/23/19938708-0-image-a-56_1571522501117.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
