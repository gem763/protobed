The former Baptist preacher believed the ills of Victorian society stemmed largely from alcohol, and saw a chance to spread the word via Britain\u2019s flourishing rail network.\n\nIt would be another four years before Cook got into the tourist business proper, organising train trips from Leicester, Nottingham and Derby to Liverpool \u2013 this time for profit.\n\nThen, in 1846, he ran the first of the Scottish tours that would soon become a lucrative operation. He conveyed 350 wide-eyed Sassenachs by train and steamboat to Glasgow, and for customers travelling for the first time, he offered guidebooks such as Cook\u2019s Scottish Tourist Practical Directory \u2013 which had a chapter headed \u201cIs It Safe for Ladies to Join in Highland Tours?\u201d\n\nWithin a decade, Cook was running continental trips: he personally conducted a trip from Harwich to Antwerp, Brussels, Cologne, Heidelberg and Strasbourg that ended up in Paris for the International Exhibition in 1855.\n\nThe Leicester-based company became more ambitious, especially after Thomas\u2019s son John Mason Cook joined. In 1865 they open their first travel agency on Fleet Street in London and the following year Cook junior led its first trip to America.\n\nThe world continued to shrink, and in 1873 Thomas Cook completed his first round-the-globe tour, marketed as \u201cLondon to London\u201d, for 200 guineas. About this time the firm became one of the first to use travellers\u2019 cheques: it called them \u201ccircular notes\u201d.\n\nJohn took over in 1879 and ran the firm until his death 20 years later, when his three sons inherited Thomas Cook & Son. Its success continued into the 20th century as the skies opened up, with the company chalking up another first when it offered \u201cpleasure trips by air\u201d in 1919.\n\nIn 1928 the family sold up to the Belgian owners of the Orient Express, but the second world war saw it become part of the nationalised British Railways. After the war, sales took off again with the era of package holidays. By 1950, more than a million Britons were travelling abroad each year, mainly to France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland.\n\nThomas Cook returned to private ownership in 1972 and has seen a series of mergers and takeovers. In 2007, it merged with the UK-listed owner of Airtours, MyTravel Group, which nearly collapsed in 2011 but was bailed out by its banks. Now, 178 years on, in an industry its founder would not recognise, Thomas Cook may have come to the end of its journey.", "description": "The father of modern tourism set up shop, modestly and soberly, 178 years ago in the east Midlands", "authors": ["Zoe Wood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a02083142e74f7e361303dcb7ec694329905751e/81_113_2030_1217/master/2030.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=587042983ddc954449cc013cb84c0e02", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
