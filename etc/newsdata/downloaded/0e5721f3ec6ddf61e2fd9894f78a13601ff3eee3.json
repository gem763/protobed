Unendurable. Pointless. @vuecinemas,\u2019 he asked his 451,400 Twitter followers.\n\nVue Cinemas promptly replied and seemed pretty concerned about Hugh\u2019s poor cinema experience.\n\nThe ever-so helpful assistant \u2018Rachel\u2019 replied: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry for any disappointment felt with the volume levels in our venues Hugh, please be assured we do regularly check these to ensure they comply to health and safety standards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll ensure your feedback is passed on to the relevant teams.

But you don\u2019t know which cinema I was in. So how can you pass it on?\u2019\n\nWell in case you were wondering, Hugh watched the Joker at Fulham Broadway on Saturday night in screen seven.\n\nHe cheekily added: \u2018But joke was on us.\u2019\n\nJoker has proved to be a huge box office success after grossing nearly $300 million (\u00a3270 million) worldwide.\n\nAnd while fans and critics have heaped praise on the latest installment, Hugh isn\u2019t the only one displeased about the Joker.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter claims Jared Leto, who played the Joker in Suicide Squad, felt \u2018alienated and upset\u2019 when he discovered the studio approved a solo Joker film that wasn\u2019t connected to the DC Extended Universe.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
