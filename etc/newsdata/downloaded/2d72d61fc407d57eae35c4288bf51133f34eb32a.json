A password manager is a good investment (and some are free).\n\nDon\u2019t use debit cards, only credit cards, for remote purchases; your liability is greater with debit cards.\n\nWhen shopping online, paying with PayPal can add an additional layer of protection; it won\u2019t reveal your card number or bank details.\n\nDon\u2019t swipe a card at the pump, pay inside instead.\n\nSet up alerts on your mobile phone so you\u2019re notified of every purchase made with your credit card.\n\nDo the same for elderly people and teenagers in your family.\n\nDon\u2019t buy online at stores that don\u2019t have a lock in the URL window. Call in your order instead.\n\nFreeze your credit at the three credit agencies Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.", "description": "Paying inside at gas stations instead of at the pump is one way to reduce your risk.", "authors": ["Mary Hadar", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/b9fqYaXqsNpollkb1omVoJTcJPw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PYKMQXEKS4I6RHKZ3TGCYDFLZ4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
