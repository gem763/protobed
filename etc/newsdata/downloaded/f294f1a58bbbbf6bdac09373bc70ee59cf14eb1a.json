Lindsey Graham, who told reporters on Capitol Hill that the investigation into Trump is \u201ca lynching in every sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty well accurate\u2014this is a shame, this is a joke,\u201d Graham told a gaggle of reporters on Monday morning. \u201cThis is a lynching in every sense. This is un-American. I\u2019ve never seen a situation in my lifetime as a lawyer where somebody\u2019s accused of a major misconduct who cannot confront the accusers, call witnesses on their behalf, and have the discussion in the light of day so the public can judge.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s Monday morning tweet\u2014in which he encouraged Republicans to \u201cremember what they are witnessing here - a lynching\u201d\u2014is the latest escalation in the president\u2019s increasingly hyperbolic reactions to the impeachment inquiry, which he has called a \u201ccoup,\u201d a \u201cscam\u201d and, of course, a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nLater on Monday, Graham doubled down on the comparison, calling the impeachment inquiry \u201cliterally a political lynching,\u201d and accusing reporters of holding Republicans to a higher standard than Democrats.\n\nUnlike Graham, most Republicans said the president\u2019s word, which is strongly associated with the extrajudicial murder of black people in the Jim Crow South, was going too far.\n\nSen. John Thune (R-SD), the party\u2019s number-two leader in the Senate, called the comparison \u201cnot appropriate in any context.\u201d Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) tweeted that while \u201cwe can all disagree on the process, and argue merits\u2026 never should we use terms like \u2018lynching\u2019\u201d to describe the constitutionally enacted process of an impeachment inquiry. \u201cThe painful scourge in our history has no comparison to politics, and @realDonaldTrump should retract this immediately. May God help us to return to a better way.\u201d\n\nSen. Tim Scott, who represents South Carolina along with Graham and is one of two black Republicans in all of Congress, said that while he understands the president\u2019s frustration, he himself would not describe the impeachment process as a lynching.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that the impeachment process is the closet thing to a political death row trial, so I get his absolute rejection of the process,\u201d Scott told reporters on the Hill. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t use the word \u2018lynching.\u2019\u201d\n\nOther Republicans, repeating a similar tactic to other incidents in which the president tweeted something racist, sexist, or otherwise inflammatory, declined to comment or alleged not to have read Trump\u2019s tweet at all. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) declined to comment on whether the investigation amounted to a \u201clynching,\u201d and Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) said that he wouldn\u2019t comment until he\u2019d seen the entire series of tweets.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, condemned both Trump\u2019s remarks and Graham\u2019s defense of them\u2014even going to far as to accuse Graham of buckling under the pressure of presidential blackmail.\n\n\u201cFeels once again like Trump has something compromising on Lindsey to make him defend the indefensible,\u201d tweeted Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA).\n\nJamie Harrison, who is running to unseat Graham in next year\u2019s election, tweeted that Graham \u201chas turned his back on South Carolina values, and invited him to join him at the ground-breaking ceremony of the African-American Museum in Charleston \u201cfor a refresh on the painful history of lynching in our state.\u201d\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley defended Trump\u2019s use of the word.\n\n\u201cThe president has used many words, all types of language, to talk about the way the media has treated him,\u201d Gidley told reporters outside the White House, adding that Trump \u201cwasn\u2019t trying to compare himself to the horrific history in this country at all.\u201d\n\nGidley then began talking about Trump\u2019s work on bringing down unemployment \u201cfor the African-American community,\u201d a common defense in past incidents when the president has engaged in racist attacks on his critics or political opponents.\n\nGraham, a longtime defender of some of the president\u2019s most appalling excesses, represents South Carolina, a state with a violent history of racial injustice. According to the Equal Justice Initiative, a legal non-profit, an estimated 184 black people were the victims of lynchings in the state between 1877 and 1950. The number of those killed by white mobs in the Jim Crow South without the ability to confront accusers, call witnesses, and be tried by a jury of their peers tops an estimated 4,000 people.", "description": "\u201cThis is un-American,\u201d Graham told reporters.", "authors": ["Scott Bixby", "National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571761105/191022-bixy-graham-tease_ie49ph", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
