War planes have been circling, the town has been hit by days of artillery bombardment and intense gunfire has been heard.\n\nMeanwhile a spokesman for the Turkey-backed Syrian fighters told Reuters news agency they had seized a strategically important road between Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ain and 18 villages had been captured during the advance.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Turkey-backed rebels claim part of Ras al-Ain\n\nKurdish media reports said Kurdish female politician Hevrin Khalaf, secretary general of the Syrian Future Party, had been killed, although it was unclear how she had died.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The key border town has been hit by heavy Turkish bombardment\n\nOn Friday, the Pentagon said its base near the northern Syrian town of Kobane - which was not included in the US withdrawal and where Turkey knew US forces were present - had seen shell fire from Turkish positions. There were no injuries.\n\nTurkey said it had been responding to fire from the area and had ceased its bombardment after being informed by the US.\n\nThe SDF are facing numerous Turkish ground and air assaults along a stretch of the Turkey-Syria border about 75 miles (120km) long, correspondents say.\n\nSome 74 SDF fighters had been killed, mostly in the area around the town of Tal Abyad, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said.\n\nMeanwhile 49 fighters with Turkish-backed Syrian rebels have also been killed.\n\nTurkey's military says one of its soldiers has been killed and three others wounded.\n\nWhat is the situation for civilians?\n\nMost of the civilian deaths occurred in the Tal Abyad area, the SOHR said. Dozens have also been seriously injured. Aid groups say as many as 450,000 people could be forced to move.\n\nThe fighting has also forced Tal Abyad's only public hospital to close.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Residents flee their homes in Ras al-Ain\n\nOn the Turkish side, at least five people including a Syrian baby were reportedly killed in Kurdish shelling of Turkish border towns.\n\nWhy is the offensive happening?\n\nKurdish leaders - whose militia fought with the US to defeat IS - accuse the US of stabbing them in the back after Mr Trump effectively gave Turkey the go-ahead to move into north-eastern Syria.\n\nMr Trump now says he wants the US to negotiate a truce between Nato ally Turkey and the Kurds. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however, says the military operation will continue.\n\nMr Erdogan says he wants to create a \"safe zone\" in northern Syria free of Kurdish militias which could also be home to Syrian refugees.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption US forces are still present in parts of northern Syria, including Hassakeh province\n\nThe incursion has been condemned by many in the US and other Western countries and pressure is building in Washington to get Turkey to stop.\n\nPresident Trump spoke briefly about the situation as he prepared to head to a rally on Friday, saying: \"We don't want them killing a lot of people... if we have to use sanctions we will.\"\n\nWhat are fears about IS based on?\n\nIS appears to be trying to take advantage of the Turkish incursion.\n\nOn Saturday it declared a new campaign in Syria, which the group said was to avenge its members' detention in Kurdish-run prisons.\n\nFive IS members broke out of a prison in the city of Qamishli on Friday after Turkish shelling nearby, a Kurdish spokesman said. IS also said it was behind a car bombing there on the same day.\n\nThe SDF say they are holding more than 12,000 suspected IS members in seven prisons, and at least 4,000 of them are foreign nationals. The exact locations have not been revealed, but some are reportedly close to the Turkish border.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Inside the camp of IS families in Syria\n\nTwo camps - Roj and Ain Issa - holding families of suspected IS members are inside the \"safe zone\".\n\nOn Friday the Kurdish-led authorities said discussions were under way on how to move the Ain Issa camp, which had been hit by shelling.\n\nTurkey says it will take responsibility for the IS prisoners it found during its offensive.\n\nAre you in the affected area?
