At this point, she began forging a career in film the television industry.\n\nHowever, life - or death - intervened and after a turbulent few years, Jasmine, then aged 25, said she felt 'alone and directionless'.\n\nJasmine applied for a job as an assistant funeral director despite the fact she had no experience\n\nAround this time, she lost a favourite teacher, a man who was like a father figure as well as a mentor and friend.\n\n'He'd always had such faith in me and I felt like I'd let him down,' she said. 'That's when I realised it was time for a change,' she said.\n\nI had no prior experience and there was no point pretending otherwise\n\n'I spent a lot of time soul searching and realised all of these experiences I'd had over the last few years had changed who I was.'\n\nA Google search headed up with the question 'Get me out of here, what am I doing with my life?' and 'funeral jobs in Sydney' set Jasmine on an entirely new path.\n\nIt was quite by chance a job popped up at Walter Carter, a family-owned funeral home run by five generations since the 1870s.\n\nApplying for the role of a funeral director-in-training - without any experience wasn't daunting for Jasmine.\n\n'I had no prior experience and there was no point pretending otherwise,' she said.\n\nWhat does the role of a funeral director entail? * Arrange all matters requested by the family taking into consideration the legal, social, cultural and religious considerations relating to the deceased and to the mourners. * Transportation of the deceased from the place of death to the mortuary. * Preparation of the deceased. * Collation of certificates from hospital or doctor's surgery. * Completion of statutory requirements. * Preparation and insertion of newspaper notices. * Contact with clergy or funeral celebrant. * Organise bookings at the venue, church, cemetery and/or crematorium. * Officially register the death. * Obtain copies of the death certificate. * Organise all details of the funeral service, including the supply of vehicles and pall bearers. * Advise on religious and ceremonial requirements in relation to the funeral service and to visitation and other customs prior to, during and after the funeral.

You either are or you're not when it comes to bodies.'\n\nJasmine is quick to stress there's a firm distinction between bodies that are prepped, which the public sees, and those in an untreated state.\n\nJasmine (pictured left) working alongside mortician Amber Coote (pictured right) ensures the deceased are properly prepared ahead of any public viewing\n\n'They [bodies] can be very different. I won't go into detail but death doesn't look the way many visualise it and the way it is portrayed on television and movies where the person looks pale and polished.'\n\nWhat does a typical day look like for Jasmine? * Handles first calls from family * Collecting the deceased * Sitting with the family to arrange the funeral * Contacting venues and suppliers to co-ordinate funeral requests * Working with crematorium/cemetery staff * Trimming coffins * Washing hearses * Assisting the mortuary staff with preparation of the deceased * Creating slideshows and curating music * Applying for a Death Certificate * Conducting the funeral\n\nShe said while people perceive the job of funeral director as that of 'just putting makeup on the dead', it is, of course, far more complex.\n\n'It can be days or even weeks before a funeral takes place and natural processes are still going to occur, even with refrigeration,' she said.\n\n'There's a reason why preparation goes into these things... and why we deal with it \"behind the curtain\" so the general public doesn't have to.'\n\nIn order to learn the ropes, Jasmine started out as a funeral assistant and spent a year working with a mentor, watching and being taught the 'ins and outs' of the many different types of funerals and behind-the-scenes processes.\n\nAfter 18 months, she progressed to arranging and conducting funerals and after two years she stepped out on her own.\n\n'With experience, I'm more confident of course, but always careful to not become complacent,' she said.\n\n'No two funerals are the same so you've got to stay on your toes.'\n\nJasmine (pictured left with her colleagues from Walter Carter Funerals) said every funeral is different, however, the circumstances of some deaths have affected her more than others\n\nEach funeral Jasmine has conducted has affected her in different ways, some more than others.\n\n'The first funeral you do for a child, the first time you meet someone who is terminally ill and plan their funeral with them and then carry out their wishes once they die,' she said.\n\n'The first suicide or violent death... they all affect you differently.\n\n'There are some that just tap into your soul and you have to allow yourself time to let the sadness wash over you.'\n\nWhat attributes does a person need to become a funeral director? * Diversity inclusive - people die irrespective of age, nationality, religion, culture, gender, sexuality or financial means * Patient and selfless * Caring, considerate and compassionate * Understanding and insightful as to the client's needs * Organised * Strong logistical skills * Friendly and authentic * Flexible * Good listener, planner and implementor * Willing to provide support: emotional and logistical * Sensitive and emotionally intelligent * Honest, reliable and trustworthy * Accuracy is critical in spelling, dates and carrying out instructions to the letter * Proud to help and proud to serve Source: Australian Funeral Directors Association\n\nThen there are the more memorable events such as being part of the first funeral ever to be held in the Sydney Opera House.\n\n'Our funeral cortege was escorted by a fleet of police through the middle of city in peak hour traffic,' she said.\n\n'We didn't have to stop for any red lights. It was so cool.'\n\nJasmine usually directs between three and five funerals a week and her role is all-encompassing.\n\nJasmine said she views her career choice as a privilege and that it's an honour to help people create meaningful ways to say goodbye to their loved ones\n\nIn addition to paperwork, her days can be spent helping families through their planned arrangement and assisting them with details of their loved one's ceremony.\n\n'An unexpectedly difficult part of my job is putting together the slideshows,' she said.\n\n'I watch a person I've just taken into my care grow up, experience life, get married, travel, have children and then watch as their children grow up - all through a few photographs.\n\n'It makes them very real and reminds me how every person has their story and their journey and every journey I'm part of is a privilege.'", "description": "Jasmine Cameron, 29, is a funeral director in Sydney's East.
