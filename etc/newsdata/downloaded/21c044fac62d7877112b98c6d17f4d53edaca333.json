They think they are on the brink of a brave new Socialist dawn.'\n\nThey added that the decision was 'proof that turkeys vote for Christmas' and there would be a \u2018huge\u2019 revolt, adding: \u2018It just gets Johnson completely off the hook.\u2019\n\nDespite him agreeing to whip in favour of the Early Parliamentary General Election Bill this afternoon many are expected to vote against it - but look unlikely to stop it becoming law.\n\nJeremy Corbyn told his shadow cabinet this morning Labour would launch the 'most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen' now a No Deal Brexit was 'off the table'\n\nIt puts him on a collision path with backbenchers who see the party languishing in the polls and fear that he is leading them to a disaster\n\nMr Corbyn told his shadow cabinet this morning Labour would launch the 'most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen' now a No Deal Brexit was 'off the table'.\n\nBut critic Neil Coyle, who backs a second referendum, said: 'Today could be crucial. We have limited chances to get a People's Vote but anyone backing an election will prevent it, as well as allowing Johnson to bring back No Deal.\n\n'I know where I stand and am disgusted at those putting party politics before the national interest.'\n\nDurham North MP Kevan Jones said he would not vote for an election, saying he wanted the chance to vote on Boris Johnson's Withdrawal Agreement Bill.\n\nMr Corbyn's Labour continues to languish behind the Tories in the polls including this one from the weekend which saw his party 16 points behind Boris Johnson's Conservatives\n\nIn a statement on his website he said: 'The EU\u2019s decision yesterday morning to grant a ''flextension'', allowing the UK to leave before January 2020 if a deal is passed, places further importance on ensuring the bill is subject to the scrutiny it has not yet been afforded.\n\n'I would support a Programme Motion in the House, to support a timetable for the deal now before us.\n\nNow that a deal has moved past Second Reading, and time has been afforded to discuss it, the Government is now calling a General Election, an entirely unnecessary exercise, instead of allowing scrutiny of its own bill. It remains my belief today that this impasse must be overcome by deliberation and cooperation in Parliament.\n\n'As such, I will not vote for an early General Election today.'\n\nMr Corbyn's move does not mean a December election is certain, with Labour expected to support amendments to the Bill.\n\nCorbyn critic Neil Coyle, whop backs a second referendum, said: 'I know where I stand and am disgusted at those putting party politics before the national interest'\n\nCorbyn loyalist shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon told Sky they would campaign on a 'manifesto of hope'. 'We are up for the fight and we believe we are going to win it,' he said\n\nOther amendments reflecting their policy, such as votes for 16 and 17-year-olds, are being considered, along with votes for EU citizens.\n\nThe party is understood to back a change to the proposed date which, if such an amendment is selected by the Speaker, could be backed by the Liberal Democrats and the SNP.\n\nMr Corbyn told his top team on Tuesday morning: 'I have consistently said that we are ready for an election and our support is subject to a no-deal Brexit being off the table.\n\n'We have now heard from the EU that the extension of Article 50 to January 31 has been confirmed, so for the next three months, our condition of taking no-deal off the table has now been met.\n\n'We will now launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen.'\n\nLabour campaign group Momentum tweeted: 'Labour are officially backing an election. This is the opportunity of a lifetime to put an end to the shambolic mess the Tories have made and return hope to millions. Let's do this.'\n\nAnd Corbyn loyalist shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon told Sky they would campaign on a 'manifesto of hope'.\n\n'We are up for the fight and we believe we are going to win it,' he said.\n\n'We believe we can make Boris Johnson the shortest-serving prime minister.'\n\nHowever, by the timer a December election takes place, Mr Johnson will have overtaken the premiership of George Canning, who lasted 119 days.", "description": "He is facing a 'huge' revolt after he caved in and backed a pre-Christmas general election, saying he would be 'going out there to win'.
