Basketball is wildly popular in China and those two teams \u2014 largely because of LeBron James starring for the Lakers and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba\u2019s co-founder Joe Tsai now owning the Nets \u2014 would have almost certainly been a huge television draw.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re strongly dissatisfied and oppose Adam Silver\u2019s claim to support Morey\u2019s right to freedom of expression,\u201d CCTV said in a statement. \u201cWe believe that any remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability are not within the scope of freedom of speech.\u201d\n\nThe broadcaster is also reviewing all its cooperation and exchanges involving the NBA, said the statement posted to CCTV Sports\u2019 official social media account.\n\nSilver is going to Shanghai on Wednesday and said he hopes to meet with officials and some of the league\u2019s business partners there in an effort to find some sort of common ground. He said he hopes Chinese officials and fans look at the totality of the impact of the three-decade-plus relationship between the league and their country, and urged them to see his response while acknowledging there are political differences between the countries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sympathetic to our interests here and our partners that are upset,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s inconsistent on one hand to be sympathetic to them and at the same time stand by our principles.\u201d\n\nSilver said the NBA did not expect CCTV to cancel plans to show the Lakers-Nets games. \u201cBut if those are the consequences of us adhering to our values, I still feel it\u2019s very, very important to adhere to those values,\u201d Silver said.\n\nThis rift between China and the NBA started late last week when Morey tweeted a now-deleted image that read \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,\u201d in reference to months of pro-democracy demonstrations in the semiautonomous Chinese territory that has been mired in escalating violence between protesters and law enforcement.\n\nEfforts were quickly made to defuse the impact; Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta said Morey does not speak for the Rockets, and Morey returned to Twitter on Monday in an effort to clarify his meaning. But damage was clearly done: at least one Chinese sporting goods company said it was no longer cooperating with the Rockets, NBA streaming partner Tencent \u2014 which has a $1.5 billion contract with the league over the next five seasons \u2014 said it would not show Rockets games and a sports news website in China said it was no longer covering the team.\n\nFurther complicating the matter is this: China\u2019s best-known basketball player is Hall of Famer Yao Ming, who spent his NBA career with the Rockets. Yao is now the president of the Chinese Basketball Association, which has said it is suspending its relationship with the Rockets as part of the response to Morey\u2019s tweet. The CBA also canceled plans to have the G League affiliates from Houston and Dallas play preseason games in China later this month.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that together Yao Ming and I can find an accommodation,\u201d Silver said. \u201cBut he is extremely hot at the moment, and I understand it.\u201d\n\nA ceremonial NBA Cares event for an educational center in Shanghai with the Nets was canceled Tuesday, though the Nets participated in other events as scheduled. The Lakers were arriving there Tuesday. Silver said NBA Cares would still honor its bigger mission surrounding that event, including providing a gift of new computers.\n\n\u201cHow can it be possible to carry out exchanges and cooperation with China without knowing China\u2019s public opinion?\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday. \u201cNBA\u2019s cooperation with China has been going on for quite a long time, so for what should be said and what should be done, they know best.\u201d\n\nSilver also released a statement prior to his news conference, saying \u201cthose who question our motivation\u201d should know that the NBA\u2019s stance is about more than business. Many U.S. lawmakers have called for the league to take action \u2014 some even suggesting the games in China should be canceled by the NBA.\n\n\u201cWe are not apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI regret \u2014 again, having communicated directly with many friends in China \u2014 that so many people are upset, including millions and millions of our fans. At the end of the day, we come with basketball as an opportunity to sell dreams, sell hopes \u2026 that we are causing disruption in people\u2019s lives and that we are causing disharmony, that\u2019s something I regret.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Amid China backlash, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said the league won't apologize for Houston Rockets manager Daryl Morey's Hong Kong tweet", "authors": ["Stephen Wade", "Tim Reynolds"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/nba-free-speech-china.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
