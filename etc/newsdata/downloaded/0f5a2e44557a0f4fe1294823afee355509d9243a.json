(Luisa Gonzalez/Reuters)\n\nOn Sept. 1, Argentina\u2019s central bank announced new restrictions on foreign currency transactions \u2014 reversing the decision taken four years earlier to eliminate currency controls. This was not welcome news for many Argentines, whose ability to buy their currency of choice \u2014 the U.S. dollar \u2014 faces renewed restrictions.\n\nPresident Mauricio Macri focused his 2015 election campaign on freeing economic constraints that the left-wing government had put in place over the previous decade. One core part of this agenda was his promise to eliminate the capital controls. Within days of taking office, Macri rolled back those controls, which had made it difficult to buy dollars and other foreign currency.\n\n[Here\u2019s why Argentina\u2019s new president Macri let the peso crash]\n\nSo why did Macri just walk back one of his most important campaign commitments? And how will this move affect his political standing in Argentina\u2019s upcoming election? Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nThe old capital controls hurt savers\n\nArgentina has often used capital controls to combat economic instability. In 2001, a severe debt crisis led the government to make it drastically harder for people to withdraw money from their bank accounts.\n\nEconomic instability returned to Argentina several years later. With inflation above 20 percent, Argentines once again increasingly used U.S. dollars for their transactions rather than Argentine pesos. In 2011, the government, led by Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, restricted the purchase of dollars. The government tightened these restrictions between 2011 and 2015 \u2014 people could buy fewer dollars, could not use \u201csaving\u201d as a justification, and had to pay higher taxes when they used credit and debit cards abroad.\n\nThese restrictions had some success in reducing sales of the Argentine peso, but they were bad news for Argentina\u2019s savers, who were stuck with savings in high-inflation pesos, rather than low-inflation U.S. dollars. This led many savers to buy dollars on the black market, despite the legal risks and black market premium. In fact, research suggests that 10 percent of all Argentine adults bought dollars on the black market from 2011 to 2015 and that almost half of educated, urban, middle-class people did so.\n\n[How one company\u2019s deep web of corruption took down governments across Latin America]\n\nMacri\u2019s decision to remove controls was very popular\n\nMacri had excellent political reasons to get rid of capital controls. In a recently published article, we showed that the capital controls were extremely unpopular with Argentine voters.\n\nResults of a survey we conducted in 2016 showed that 61 percent of citizens agreed with Macri\u2019s 2015 decision to eliminate capital controls, compared with just 20 percent who disagreed and 19 percent who neither agreed nor disagreed.\n\nIn two different nationwide surveys, we found that large numbers of voters viewed the elimination of capital controls as the single best thing that Macri had achieved to date in his term in office. This suggests Macri reaped real political benefits by allowing Argentines to freely exchange pesos for dollars.\n\nOur study shows that Argentines who opposed the capital controls were considerably more likely to vote for Macri in the final stage of the 2015 election, even when we account for vote choice in the first stage of the election. Other research finds that people who were most affected by the capital controls \u2014 people who used the black market for dollars \u2014 were also more likely to vote for Macri.\n\nBut Argentina\u2019s economy is back in crisis\n\nSo why did Macri just put unpopular capital controls back in place? The answer is that Argentina is undergoing a severe economic crisis, which has been years in the making. After the 2015 election, Macri sought to attract foreign investors who shunned Argentina during his predecessor\u2019s tenure. By eliminating capital controls and settling a protracted legal dispute with bondholders, the government signaled a clean break with the previous administration\u2019s agenda.\n\n[Latin Americans are protesting \u2014 and throwing out \u2014 corrupt regimes. Why now?]\n\nThis restored investors\u2019 confidence \u2014 but only to a limited degree. Argentina\u2019s government still had to borrow a lot of money to finance its budget deficit, which it did by issuing large amounts of bonds, most of which were denominated in dollars.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a problem for several years, when borrowing was cheap. But in early 2018, a combination of stubbornly high inflation, persistent budget shortfalls and a severe drought damaged investor and consumer confidence. By April 2018, the peso had lost half its value. The government burned through billions of dollars of reserves and raised interest rates to sky-high levels to prop up its currency.\n\nIn June, the government announced that it had signed a $56 billion bailout agreement with the International Monetary Fund. The IMF-backed austerity program was unpopular, and included a \u201czero budget deficit\u201d pledge.\n\nPublic support for Macri quickly eroded. In a primary election held Aug. 11, the Peronist opposition defeated Macri by an unexpectedly wide margin, triggering another sell-off of pesos. The controls announced Sunday are a last-resort step by the government to prevent further depreciation of the peso.\n\nThis hurts Macri\u2019s chances of reelection\n\nWhat\u2019s the fallout? Macri faces off against Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez in Argentina\u2019s Oct. 27 election. Macri seems unlikely to win this next round, even if the capital controls stabilize the value of the peso. The new currency rules are more limited than the old ones, and primarily target businesses that deal in dollars. The restrictions on savers \u2014 the segment of the public most burdened by the controls \u2014 are fairly soft, at least for the moment.\n\nBut the return of even limited capital controls will undoubtedly antagonize some voters. Fern\u00e1ndez, the opposition candidate for the Peronist party, has so far been quiet about the return of capital controls. If, as expected, Fern\u00e1ndez wins the presidential election, his administration will probably keep the controls in place.\n\nIf experience is any guide, the controls may become more draconian as savers and businesses try to avoid them \u2014 and this would no doubt drain the new government\u2019s political capital.\n\nDon\u2019t miss anything!
