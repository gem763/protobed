An ad-supported tier will reportedl launch in 2021.\n\nThe pricing tier makes it one of the most expensive in the shifting streaming landscape. Apple TV Plus is only $4.99 a month, while Disney+ is sitting at $6.99 a month. AT&T is in a tricky spot. HBO Now, its other HBO-branded streaming service, is $15 a month. That\u2019s about the same cost as the channel via cable packages.\n\nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson teased the importance of today\u2019s event, which took place at the iconic Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, California, during a call with investors yesterday. Stephenson called the streaming service \u201cvery different from anything else that you\u2019ve seen in the market so far,\u201d adding that, \u201cThis is not Netflix. This is not Disney. This is HBO Max.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s showcasing of HBO Max was also designed to put investors at ease. AT&T has drawn ire from investors who chastised the decision to spend more than $85 billion on acquiring Time Warner (now WarnerMedia) just a few years after spending $67 billion to buy DirecTV, a service that is now hemorrhaging customers. Investment firm Elliott issued a letter to the company calling for AT&T to divest itself of unnecessary business arms. The investment firm noted that AT&T\u2019s acquisition of WarnerMedia didn\u2019t seem to make any sense.\n\nStephenson called the streaming service \u201cvery different from anything else that you\u2019ve seen in the market so far\u201d\n\nWhile HBO Max enters an increasingly crowded market, Stephenson said the HBO name brand already distinguishes the service from its competitors. Stephenson added that at the tier of the market where the company \u201cintends to play, it is not that crowded.\u201d\n\nHBO Max is poised to launch with an impressive number of titles for customers. Unlike HBO Now, there will also be a substantial focus on children\u2019s programming and less prestigious but still incredibly popular series. Friends and The Big Bang Theory will both stream exclusively on HBO Max, as will new episodes of Sesame Street (moving from HBO\u2019s traditional broadcast channel), although those episodes will eventually make their way to PBS. The entire Studio Ghibli library will live exclusively on HBO Max, too. Not to mention, the streaming service will play home to show reboots like Gossip Girl, which originally aired on the CW \u2014 a network co-owned by WarnerMedia. That doesn\u2019t account for older WarnerMedia series that the company has streaming rights to and will add for customers.\n\nUnlike HBO Now or Disney+, HBO Max is a more general entertainment player \u2014 even if Stephenson reportedly balks at the term \u201cgeneral\u201d in anything to do with HBO. The new streaming service is designed for everyone, which isn\u2019t necessarily true for HBO Now (mostly adults) or Disney+ (mostly children, and Marvel or Star Wars fans). HBO Max needs to appeal to a broader audience in order to scale at the speed AT&T is looking for. Stephenson told investors on yesterday\u2019s earnings call that HBO Max is forecasted to hit 50 million subscribers in the US by 2024.\n\nAll of which means that HBO Max is going to introduce a ton of content as quickly as possible. AT&T is investing heavily into HBO, increasing the number of shows and films it produces by 50 percent. The company doesn\u2019t have a full launch list just yet \u2014 Disney+ will come with nearly 1,000 titles when it\u2019s released on November 12th \u2014 but expect more information closer to HBO Max\u2019s official launch.", "description": "HBO Max, AT&T\u2019s big foray into streaming, received a price tag and launch date at a special event held for investors.
