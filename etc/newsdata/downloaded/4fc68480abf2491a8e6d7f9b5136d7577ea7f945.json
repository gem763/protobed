Iran says: \u201cNot a big deal, you just killed your creature.\u201d\n\nIt was a stunning win for a somewhat beleaguered president, who has been hounded by critics, allies, experts and even key figures within his own party, for disastrously flip-flopping on Syria over the past three weeks.\n\nBut, while the world is congratulating Trump right now, and this will no doubt boost his re-election chances, taking out Baghdadi will not undo the damage his policies have already done to US political standing in the region and with its allies.\n\n\u201cWhether by \u2018chance\u2019 or by design, the raid against al-Baghdadi is a real bonanza for President Trump after he appeared to effectively backstab one of America\u2019s main allies in the fight against Isis,\u201d says Michael A Horowitz, a security analyst and head of intelligence at Le Beck International.\n\n\u201cWhat al-Baghdadi\u2019s death won\u2019t reverse is Washington\u2019s gradual loss of influence in Syria and the region as a whole, and the perception that America is not a dependable ally.\u201d\n\nTo explain why, you have to go back to 6 October, when Trump caught the world off guard with a somewhat poorly worded statement.\n\nHe said US troops would step aside and not hinder an imminent Turkish invasion into northern Syria against Kurdish forces, the US\u2019s longterm ally that has lost more than 10,000 fighters helping Washington defeat Isis.\n\nCritics say it gave the green light to Turkey\u2019s controversial incursion, which kicked off just days later, and has seen nearly 200,000 people displaced.\n\nMore than 100 Isis fighters exploiting the chaos have escaped from SDF-run prison, sparking fears of a resurgence of the jihadi group.\n\nTrump defended his actions saying he wanted the US to extricate itself from dangerous and endless wars in the Middle East region.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re bringing our soldiers back home,\u201d he said repeatedly. But in reality there was a hasty and messy redeployment, as the fighting intensified.\n\nRather than flying the 1,000 or so troops in Syria home, a few hundred soldiers were pelted with vegetables as they crossed from Syria into Iraq. Embarrassingly Baghdad hit back, saying that the US forces had no permission to stay permanently.\n\nThe US also had to bomb the bases they left behind.\n\nThey then panicked about the oil fields in Syria, which are vulnerable to attacks from the regime and Isis, and so decided to redeploy a few hundred troops and tanks to guard the oil facilities.\n\nAs the news was swirling about Baghdadi being killed, footage of US soldiers driving back into Syria was also being shared online.\n\nBefore Baghdadi\u2019s killing, from Israel to the Gulf, officials, diplomats and commentators in response expressed fears that the Trump administration was ultimately prioritising isolationism over loyalty to all his regional partners.\n\nEven Saudi analysts writing for the usually carefully-worded pan-Arab newspaper Asharq al-Awsat spoke of the \u201cthe state of confusion and emptiness\u201d in US relations.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, had a field day walking through abandoned US bases.\n\nAnd it was Vladimir Putin who eventually hammered out the details of the ceasefire between Turkey and the Kurds, which included Russian military police, flown in from Chechnya, doing joint patrols of Syrian borderlands.\n\nBoth politically and geographically Russia was taking over the space the US has long enjoyed as a regional powerhouse.\n\nHorowitz says Trump managed to both alienate Washington\u2019s Kurdish partners and Turkey, by withdrawing and letting Turkey take over \u2013 only to later threaten Ankara with sanctions for an operation the president effectively approved.\n\n\u201cWhatever was done after, including the ceasefire and pledge to maintain some US presence to protect \u2018the oil\u2019, can only be described as chaotic damage control,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe US effectively jeopardised its chance to have a say in Syria\u2019s future, leaving Russia as the last remaining power broker and giving Isis a chance to take advantage of the vacuum that was created to reorganise.\u201d\n\nWhile Baghdadi\u2019s death is important, as proved by comparison to Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda, terror groups can survive the death of their leaders.\n\nAs Horowitz concludes: \u201cThe self-inflicted wound America suffered will be far harder to heal.\u201d", "description": "You could feel the unbridled joy from Donald Trump when he teased the world with a six-word tweet at three o\u2019clock on Sunday morning: \u201cSomething very big has just happened!\u201d he said without elaborating.", "authors": ["Bel Trew"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/27/18/al-Baghdadi-raid-6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
