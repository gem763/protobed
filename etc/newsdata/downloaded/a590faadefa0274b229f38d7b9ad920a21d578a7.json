If tensions turn into warfare, the factory-fresh F-35s could face an Iranian air force operating some of the oldest active fighters in the world.\n\nThe Iranians with their four-decade-old F-4s, F-5s and F-14s might not seem to have a chance against the Americans flying arguably the world\u2019s most advanced fighter aircraft. But history, and recent testing show how Iranian pilots flying old planes could defeat Americans flying brand-new ones.\n\nFor one, the F-35, while new, isn\u2019t necessarily a stellar aerial performer. In 2015 someone associated with the F-35 test effort leaked an official report explaining the stealth fighter\u2019s limitations in air-to-air maneuvers with an F-16.\n\n\u201cThe F-35 was at a distinct energy disadvantage,\u201d an unnamed F-35 test pilot wrote in a scathing five-page brief. \u201cInsufficient pitch rate,\u201d he added. \u201cEnergy deficit to the bandit would increase over time.\u201d\n\nThe complaints continued. \u201cThe flying qualities in the blended region (20 to 26 degrees [angle of attack]) were not intuitive or favorable,\u201d the pilot wrote, adding that there\u2019s no point for an F-35 pilot to get into a sustained, close turning battle with an enemy pilot. \u201cThere were not compelling reasons to fight in this region.\u201d\n\nThe pilot\u2019s revelations underscore what many observers long have suspected about the F-35. While its radar-evading qualities and high-end sensors might allow it to gain a favorable position for long-range missile shots, in a close fight the F-35 hardly excels.\n\nIf an Iranian pilot can survive a merge with an F-35 and engage the stealth fighter in a turning dogfight, the Iranian might just bag himself a stealth fighter. It\u2019s worth noting that the Iranian air force flies scores of fighters that excel precisely in that regime.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Could Iran take one down?", "authors": ["David Axe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZNdR112oqI.SASPWJkcYXg--~B/aD03MjQ7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/651ff4f0dded53bc4960417e80411c84", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
