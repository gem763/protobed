Trump said the wall goes deep into the ground, making it difficult to tunnel underneath, and is topped with heat-absorbing material to deter climbers.\n\n\u201cYou can fry an egg on that wall,\u201d he said. \u201cThis wall can\u2019t be climbed.\u201d\n\nTrump told reporters he expected that nearly 500 miles (800 km) of new barrier would be completed by the end of next year.\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters are eager for him to keep his promise to build a wall to stem migrant crossings through Mexico from Central America. Crowd chants of \u201cBuild the Wall!\u201d are often the loudest at his political rallies across the country.\n\nIn February, Trump declared a national emergency in order to divert funding for wall construction when Congress refused to provide the amount he requested. As a candidate in 2016, Trump had promised that Mexico would pay for the wall. It has refused to do so.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump visits a section of the U.S.-Mexico border wall in Otay Mesa, California, U.S. September 18, 2019. REUTERS/Tom Brenner\n\nPRAISE AND A WARNING\n\nOn the border wall visit, Trump said Mexico has been \u201cfantastic\u201d on immigration issues, noting that it has deployed tens of thousands of troops to the border to help reduce the flow of migrants. But he warned that if Mexico ended its cooperation he could slap tariffs on the country\u2019s imports to the United States. He said a 5% tariff could easily pay for the border wall in six months.\n\nTrump has sought to assure supporters he is making good on his border wall promise, but according to Politifact, his administration has not built new segments of a wall since he took office in January 2017, although it has replaced roughly 60 miles (96 km) of existing barriers.\n\nDemocrats sharply criticize Trump\u2019s policies and do not believe a wall is the answer to the country\u2019s immigration challenges.\n\nTrump is also collecting cash to bolster his campaign coffers as multiple Democratic presidential candidates ramp up efforts to take him on in the November 2020 election.\n\nThe president\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee were expected to raise some $15 million at events during Trump\u2019s western trip, according to an RNC official. The RNC raised $23.5 million in August and $141.4 million for the 2019-2020 election cycle so far, and has $53.8 million in cash on hand, the official said.\n\nUnlike his predecessor, Democratic President Barack Obama, Trump is not a frequent visitor to California, a heavily Democratic state that Trump lost by more than 4 million votes in 2016. He used his visit to criticize the state for its challenges dealing with a growing homeless population.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let Los Angeles, San Francisco and numerous other cities destroy themselves by allowing what\u2019s happening,\u201d he told reporters on Air Force One on Tuesday, suggesting that the issue had dented those cities\u2019 reputations.\n\nSlideshow (15 Images)\n\n\u201cIf these Democrat liberal politicians don\u2019t straighten it out, the federal government will have to come in,\u201d Trump told reporters at the border wall on Wednesday.\n\nBig-city mayors in California have said the homelessness problem in the most-populous U.S. state should not be a partisan issue.", "description": "President Donald Trump showed off a section of wall along the U.S. border with Mexico on Wednesday in a bid to illustrate his commitment to crack down on illegal border crossings as he raises money in California for his re-election campaign.", "authors": ["Jeff Mason", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431427723&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I02B", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
