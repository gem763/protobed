The decision was based on an expansive but reasonable reading of the state\u2019s public nuisance law\u2014an interpretation that demonstrates the explosive potential of this little-understood legal theory.\n\nJudge Thad Balkman\u2019s decision does two things. First, it provides a road map for other courts to use in upcoming litigation against other pharmaceutical companies involved in the manufacture, sale and distribution of these addictive drugs. The reckoning is overdue. States should continue to be aggressive about deploying public nuisance law in the future. Second, it puts the scare into other Big Pharma companies that had a hand in creating and then fueling the crisis. Indeed, just one day after this blockbuster decision, news broke that the company most associated with the opioid crisis, Purdue Pharma, was willing to offer between $10 and $12 billion to settle the claims against them.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAlthough public nuisance is not a well-known legal doctrine, it is both simple and mighty. States can pass any law designed to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of their residents. This \u201cpolice power\u201d allows states to bring suits against any person or other legal entity that presents a public nuisance\u2014a menace to the public\u2019s health. All states have methods of dealing with public nuisances, either by statute or through judicial decisions. Oklahoma\u2019s statute is broad, yet typical. A nuisance is \u201cunlawfully doing an act \u2026 which \u2026 injures or endangers the comfort, repose, health, or safety of others.\u201d\n\nThe law clearly applies in this case. Having spelled out the actions of Johnson & Johnson (along with its subsidiaries and other makers and sellers of opioids) in exhaustive and damning detail, Balkman had little trouble in declaring the actions of the company to constitute a public nuisance. Through 58 detailed paragraphs, the defendants are called to account for aggressively and misleadingly promoting opioids in a variety of ways. The extensive findings include overpromotion to physicians \u201cintended to influence their prescribing behavior,\u201d and misrepresentations as to the addictive nature of these drugs. For instance, the defendants used the term \u201cpseudoaddiction\u201d to convince doctors that their patients who sought higher doses of the drugs weren\u2019t actually addicted, but simply in great pain. They also \u201cmade substantial payments\u201d to various pain management advocacy groups; two of these groups then issued a \u201cConsensus Statement\u201d that reinforced the idea that pain was undertreated, and that called fear of addiction and \u201cregulator action\u201d impediments. (Worse, the statement was drafted by a committee that included \u201can attorney who at one time represented defendants on opioid-related issues,\u201d as well as several people who had a financial relationship with them.)\n\nJohnson & Johnson has already said it will appeal the decision. But whether or not the ruling is overturned on appeal, the facts are now laid out for litigants in other cases. As the settlement offer from Purdue dramatically underscores, the defendants involved in the huge bundle of consolidated cases scheduled for trial in federal court in Ohio this October have a lot to think about. In the order granting transfer and consolidation of these federal cases, the court summarizes the allegations against the manufacturers as overstating the benefits (and downplaying the risks) of the drugs, and aggressively marketing them to physicians. These bear an unsettling resemblance to the case set out in the Oklahoma decision. The consolidated cases are based on a number of theories arising under both federal and state law, including public nuisance, negligent misrepresentation and fraud. While some of these theories may founder because of their strict requirements, the breadth of public nuisance and its connection to public protection will make it a difficult opponent to counter.\n\nGiven its potential as a way of dealing with mass injury cases, why is public nuisance only coming into view now? While the explosive power resident in public nuisance has threatened bad corporate actors before, it had not been much tested until now for one reason or another. When most of the states sued the tobacco companies to try to recoup their expenses attributable to their citizens\u2019 tobacco use, they invoked public nuisance law. But those cases became part of the Master Settlement Agreement, by which the companies agreed to pay the states a total of more than $200 billion in order to avoid further legal proceedings. So the viability of the public nuisance claim never went to trial, though it drove the settlement.\n\nCases against gun sellers seeking to call them to account for the deadly costs of their marketing and distribution practices were starting to gain traction under public nuisance theory, but Congress yanked the rug out from under those claims by enacting the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) in 2005, which declared most suits against gun sellers out of order\u2014even claims that were already in process.\n\nSo the Oklahoma decision has awakened a sleeping giant. The very breadth of public nuisance has led some to complain of abuse, but the criticism is misplaced. It\u2019s true, as critics charge, that these issues would be better handled through legislation and regulation. But that\u2019s not happening. Legislators are captured by special interests, and\u2014with special relevance to the opioid crisis\u2014the Food and Drug Administration is often playing catch-up. Balkman noted that, although the defendants\u2019 marketing practices began in the mid-1990s, it wasn\u2019t until 2004 that the agency ordered the defendants to stop stating that one of the drugs was less addictive than the others, because there was no evidence in support of that claim. Even then, the wrongful marketing and sale of these drugs continued.\n\nGiven few options, states and cities are trying to protect their citizens with whatever tools they have available. In the Connecticut lawsuit brought by surviving family members of the children massacred in Newtown, the state Supreme Court found a way around the PLCAA through state unfair trade practices law, and that theory could apply in the opioid context, too. But those claims are brought by the injured parties themselves (or the families of the deceased) and are hard to win because of the difficulty of linking any particular death to marketing and sales practices. Cities and states, though, face no such problems when using public nuisance, because the overall costs of the epidemic can much more easily be traced to these same illegal and unscrupulous practices.\n\nThe Oklahoma decision was very likely just the opening salvo in what looks to be a sustained campaign against the opioid-pushing companies. If it juices the incentive to settle, we may still not realize the full potential of public nuisance law from this one case. But thanks to Balkman\u2019s decision, there will very likely be some degree of accountability. If that happens, the public nuisance will have been abated\u2014and that will be the best we can hope for now. Better would have been responsible marketing and sale of these drugs in the first place.", "description": "The limits of \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d law to remedy massive societal problems haven\u2019t been tested much\u2014until now.", "authors": ["Michael Kruse", "John Culhane"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a0/fb/352ff51649eb804352c4eff624fb/190828-culhane.jpg"}
