Earlier this year, Senate Republicans didn\u2019t hesitate to challenge the administration on its plan to impose a 5 percent tariff on all goods imported from Mexico. \u201cI will yield to nobody in passion and seriousness and commitment for securing the border,\u201d Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said to reporters at the time. \u201cBut there\u2019s no reason for Texas farmers and ranchers and manufacturers and small businesses to pay the price of massive new taxes.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Senate Republicans took a collective stand against Trump after the White House announced his plan this week to withdraw American forces from northern Syria, clearing the path for Turkish military operations against Kurds in the region. Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, warned Trump against a \u201cprecipitous withdrawal\u201d; Lindsey Graham of South Carolina called the move \u201ca big win for Iran and Assad , a big win for ISIS\u201d; Ben Sasse of Nebraska said the president \u201cneeds to know that this bad decision will likely result in the slaughter of allies who fought with us, including women and children.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that the Republican base isn\u2019t invested in American foreign policy toward Syria. It\u2019s also true, however, that Trump may well lash out against his Republican critics, which could turn his voters against them on this particular issue. But Senate Republicans spoke right up. This time around, the fear that\u2019s supposed to drive their acquiescence to Trump doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nIf Republicans are willing to challenge Trump on his foreign policy, including the disposition of American troops abroad, then the difference when it comes to Ukraine \u2014 as well as other scandals, like the president\u2019s continued corruption and self-dealing \u2014 may just be that they don\u2019t see a problem. You can read Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s willingness to downplay Trump\u2019s open call to intervene in the 2020 election as a craven surrender, or you can take it at face value: Maybe Rubio just doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s that big of a deal.\n\nNone of this would be out of character for congressional Republicans. These are the lawmakers who refused to fix the Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court killed a key provision of the law in 2013. They said nothing when Trump tried to launch a crusade against imaginary \u201cvoter fraud.\u201d They are at best indifferent to the restrictive laws and voter purges that keep millions of Americans from the polls.\n\nSometimes, the simplest answer is the correct one. Why are most Republicans silent in the face of the president\u2019s attempt to cheat his way to re-election? Perhaps it\u2019s because they don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong \u2014 or because they don\u2019t care if it is.", "description": "Sometimes, the simplest explanation is the correct one.", "authors": ["Jamelle Bouie"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/08/opinion/08bouieWeb/08bouieWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
