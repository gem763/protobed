But we will WIN!\u201d\n\nTaylor is scheduled to talk behind closed doors with the intelligence, foreign affairs and oversight committees. In a text message in September, Taylor said it was \u201ccrazy\u201d to withhold security aid to Ukraine for help with a political campaign. Democrats describe the holding up of aid to Ukraine to get that nation\u2019s help investigating Trump\u2019s political rivals as a quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d asked Rep. Bobby Rush, an Illinois Democrat who is African-American. \u201cDo you know how many people who look like me have been lynched, since the inception of this country, by people who look like you?\u201d Rush added in a tweet. House Majority Whip James Clyburn of South Carolina, also African-American, told CNN, \u201cthat is one word no president ought to apply to himself.\u201d\n\nConservative commentator Erick Erickson weighed in, saying, \u201cIt is not a lynching. Let\u2019s not start dropping words that are important with real historic meaning where we water them down to nothing.\u201d Meanwhile Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, defended Trump by saying the president was \u201cfrustrated.\u201d\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, generally a close Trump ally, also backed the president\u2019s use of the fraught term, reportedly saying Trump was in fact facing \u201ca lynching in every sense.\u201d\n\nAs Democrats investigate, Trump has repeatedly insisted he did nothing wrong when he spoke with Ukraine\u2019s president in July.\n\nSign up for Trump Today and more MarketWatch newsletters.", "description": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday compared Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry to a lynching, a statement that drew quick condemnation from lawmakers on Capitol...", "authors": ["Robert Schroeder", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT736_19trum_ZG_20191021184034.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
