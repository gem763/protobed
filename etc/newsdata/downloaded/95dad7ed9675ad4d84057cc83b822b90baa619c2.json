And that means declaring what I want, which is to one day be president of the United States, but not at this moment,\u201d Abrams said in an interview on \u201cThe Long Game,\u201d a Yahoo News podcast.\n\nIt\u2019s part of the 45-year-old Democrat\u2019s unique approach to politics, one that has elevated her into a sought-after and powerful voice on the left, and one of the most prominent African-American women in the country. She announced in August she would forgo a run in 2020, but is still a potential running mate to the eventual Democratic nominee, and is meanwhile speaking out about voter suppression and running an organization focused on stopping it.\n\nAbrams stands out because she does a few things that often aren\u2019t found in combination: She thinks exhaustively about her core principles and her big decisions; is disciplined and strategic; is willing to take big risks and talks openly about her reasons for doing so.\n\nThat goes for her decision to run for governor in a deep-red state in the first place, as well as her decision to not concede the race to Republican Brian Kemp, even as she acknowledged he was the legal winner and that \u201cthe law currently allows no further viable remedy,\u201d as she said last fall.\n\nIt goes for her willingness to talk about the fact that she has mapped out her life goals in an Excel spreadsheet since she was in college.\n\nAnd it goes for her decision to talk openly about wanting to be president. It\u2019s part of her mission to create new archetypes for women of color and other minorities, who she said are often conditioned to think they shouldn\u2019t have lofty ambitions and often shrink back.\n\nStacey Abrams (Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: AP [2], Getty Images) More\n\n\u201cBoldness is about being declarative of your intent, but also being confident about your right to have that intent. And those are the two pieces that are often missing for communities that are on the margins or on the outside,\u201d Abrams told Yahoo News.\n\n\u201cI talk about power because you\u2019re not supposed to. And I talk about it intentionally because people cannot see what\u2019s possible usually unless there\u2019s some example of it,\u201d she said.\n\nAbrams said there have been few \u201cactual direct examples\u201d for her to look up to in her own life. \u201cAnd so I\u2019ve spent my life trying to create these examples and exemplars of behavior,\u201d she said.\n\nIn her 2018 book \u201cLead From the Outside,\u201d Abrams described her decision to talk publicly about her ambition to be president, in a 2017 interview with Cosmopolitan magazine.\n\n\u201cPolitics 101 says never admit to wanting to be president,\u201d Abrams wrote. \u201cIn my orbit, folks flinched in dismay at my bold honesty.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d her own allies asked her.\n\n\u201cI had indeed hesitated about answering,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI could pivot, redirect. ... Or I could be forthright, cutting through the code of silence that held women and people of color back from staking a claim on simply the right to think about running for our nation\u2019s highest post.\u201d\n\nYet despite stating her intent openly, Abrams was often overshadowed in the 2018 national political conversation \u2014 even among Democrats and progressives \u2014 by Beto O\u2019Rourke, a congressman who ran for the U.S. Senate in Texas against Sen. Ted Cruz, and also lost. Part of the reason that celebrities like Beyonc\u00e9 and LeBron James took notice of O\u2019Rourke was that he was running against Cruz, who is uniquely reviled by Democrats, and even some Republicans.", "description": "Stacey Abrams ran for governor of Georgia last year and lost, but she hasn\u2019t put a lid on her ambition, telling Yahoo News that she still plans to run for president in the future, even though she passed on doing so in 2020.", "authors": ["Jon Ward", "Senior Political Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pIt1pkbyC8bZ5qxSqS4jyg--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/e8e77a30-eac2-11e9-bfaf-fe6703eef7d0", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
