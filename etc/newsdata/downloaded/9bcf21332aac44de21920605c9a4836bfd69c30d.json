It\u2019s always nice to do something massive for your opening shot, and I went really massive on the first take,\u2019 Robert told The New York Times.\n\nAlthough the masturbation scene was very much written in the script, it seems Robert went rogue and added his own flavour to the shot which surprised even the director Robert Eggers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Twilight actor revealed: \u2018It was a 180 from everything we\u2019d done in rehearsal, and I could see Robert [Eggers] a little in shock afterward.\n\n\u2018But I was like, \u201cOK, cool, I didn\u2019t get told to stop, so I\u2019ll keep going in that direction\u201d. As soon as I\u2019d done that, it was like the road started getting paved.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nClearly the British actor is comfortable with pretending to pleasure himself on-screen thanks to his most recent roles.\n\n\u2018I keep masturbating, Robert recently admitted to Variety.\n\n\u2018In the last three or four movies, I\u2019ve got a masturbation scene. I did it in High Life. I did it in Damsel. And The Devil All the Time. I only realised when I did it the fourth time.\u2019\n\nBlimey, someone give the guy a break.\n\nThe Lighthouse sees Robert star alongside Willem Dafoe as two lighthouse keepers trapped in solitude and risking their sanity on a remote New England island in the 1800s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to feigning masturbation, Robert went to great lengths to prepare for The Lighthouse, such as \u2018p**sing his pants\u2019 and making himself throw up.\n\nThe Lighthouse is out in UK cinemas on 31 January 2020.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
