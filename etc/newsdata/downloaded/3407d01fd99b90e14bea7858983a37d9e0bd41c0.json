This is even true domestically: Whereas Spain in some ways remains hyper-regionalized, everyone is welcome to blend in, stand out, or get lost in the capital, regardless of where they come from. There\u2019s a pride that comes with being a Madrile\u00f1o, yet there\u2019s also an open-minded and welcoming nature that yearns to bring visitors into the fold.\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps for these same reasons\u2014along with its bustling hub of shopping and business, the Gran V\u00eda; its world class museums; its late night ethos; and its huge park within the city, Parque del Retiro\u2014that Madrid often gets compared to New York City, particularly for first-time visitors. There are endless culinary delights, rich historical roots, and ample sightseeing, and the inimitable Spanish spirit that will likely compel you to book a return trip before long.\n\nSTAY\n\nMadrid is built for walking, and staying near the city center makes it incredibly simple to wander and explore. Check into the one-year-old VP Plaza Espa\u00f1a Design, overlooking its namesake plaza (which is currently closed for renovation until 2020). The five-star property caters to both leisure and business travelers, with sleek styling and unique amenities, such as push-button rainfall shower heads, and bathtubs walled off by one-way mirrors, enabling its user to indulge in privacy while still enjoying the room's views of the city.\n\nThe VP Plaza Espa\u00f1a Design\u2019s greatest feature is its rooftop terrace, boasting views of the Royal Palace and stunning nightly sunsets, with a pool and lounge area. Within the hotel\u2019s atrium, an enchanting 75-foot metallic waterfall sculpture pours down from the glass-bottomed pool.\n\nMadrid has more than its fair share of grand hotels from which to choose. Staying near the city center, The Westin Palace and Gran Hotel Ingl\u00e9s are standbys, while north of the Parque in the Salamanca neighborhood, Hotel Wellington and Hotel \u00danico are both smart choices.\n\nThe Mercado de San Miguel. Jake Emen\n\nEAT & DRINK\n\nThe Mercado de San Miguel is a culinary explorer\u2019s paradise. The food hall has dozens of vendors offering everything from traditional Spanish specialties\u2014 jamon, croquetas, and queso, oh my\u2014to a range of modern fare. Grab a glass of vermouth and wander around sampling for as long as you have cash, time, or stomach space to spare.\n\nTake in a show with Michelin-backed fare at Corral de la Morer\u00eda, perhaps the most storied flamenco house in town. You can either watch the performance before or after a tasting-menu dinner at the smaller, one-Michelin-star back room, or order \u00e0 la carte during the show, an experience which isn\u2019t Michelin-starred but includes many of the same dishes from the back.\n\nSpeaking of Michelin, the three-starred DiverXO is a modernist, singular standout, and a splurge worth investing in if you can snag a table. At Ginkgo Restaurant & Sky Bar at VP Plaza Espa\u00f1a Design, Spanish and Asian dishes intersect, accompanied by live music all week long and those sensational views. Hotel guests get to bypass the long queues which form streetside as visitors scramble for sunset positioning.\n\nStop into La Ray\u00faa to try Madrid's classic staple dish, cocido, for which a hefty stew replete with chickpeas, potatoes, and assorted meats is delivered to each diner via clay jug. Empty the broth over thin noodles for a first course of soup, then unload its full contents onto your plate for round two. Proceed back to your hotel to siesta.\n\nFor a night cap, head to Alberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s 1862 Dry Bar, one of the city's first and foremost modern cocktail homes. The space includes a bustling top floor serving both classics and in-house creations, as well as a more reserved, table-seating-only basement area. The newer sister bar to the property, Santos, is also worth a visit, while the intriguingly-named Salmon Guru has captured the attention of cocktail aficionados from across the globe.\n\nThere still may be no better option, though, than La Venencia, the storied, century-old institution specializing in cask-poured sherries and small accompanying plates of food. Cash only\u2014and for your sake, don\u2019t try to take any photos. Once a meeting point for the Republicans waging Civil War against Spanish Fascists in the 1930s, and yes, a Hemingway haunt, too, the \u201cwhat happens in La Venencia, stays in La Venencia\u201d sensibility is still of paramount importance here.\n\nThe Royal Palace of Madrid. Pixabay\n\nEXPLORE\n\nMadrid is a tale best seen via its plazas. The Puerta del Sol remains its beating heart as it was two centuries ago, when the Second of May Uprising of 1808 against the reign of Napoleon was held. It\u2019s also the home of Kilometer Zero, the point from which all radial roads in Spain are measured. Perhaps more recognizable is the Plaza Mayor, a large open courtyard enclosed within four multi-colored, interconnected buildings. When Philip II of the Habsburgs made Madrid his capital city, Plaza Mayor was its original city center. Philip III completed its construction, and his presence on horseback can be seen as the statue at the plaza\u2019s core. In darker times, Plaza Mayor served as the site of trials during the Spanish Inquisition, while today it\u2019s home to numerous celebratory festivals.\n\nWhile not as well known as Versailles or Buckingham Palace, the Royal Palace of Madrid is unequaled among its rivals. Consider that with 135,000 square meters of floor space, it\u2019s the size of the two aforementioned structures combined. Also worth a visit is the Catedral de la Almudena, directly across the palace\u2019s plaza.\n\nFew cities are as spoiled for art as Madrid, with the Prado and the Reina Sofia housing enough masterpieces to keep you occupied for weeks. The museum quarter abuts the Real Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico, as well as the Parque del Retiro and the many wonders and diversions spread across its 350 acres of lush green space.\n\nThe writer was hosted by the VP Plaza Espa\u00f1a Design.", "description": "With rich history and modern shopping and dining, the city is thriving", "authors": ["Jake Emen"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-116272/social", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
