Pictured: Kyle in March\n\nThe nightmare began when Victoria was called to pick Kyle up from Andrew Lanes Primary School a few hours after dropping him off.\n\nThe right side of his face had dropped, particularly the eye and the corner of his mouth was drooping, leading Victoria to fear he'd suffered a stroke.\n\nDoctors at the Lister Hospital near Stevenage decided to keep the youngster overnight to keep an close eye on him, and the next day, put him through an MRI.\n\nBy the end of that afternoon, Victoria's life turned upside down, when doctors informed her her son was suffering from a brain tumour.\n\nThe family were sent to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge in order to carry further tests.\n\nVictoria said she knew something was wrong after seeing her son's eye, but was heart-broken to hear his condition was incurable\n\nThis is where they learned that Kyle was actually suffering from the very aggressive and always fatal diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, a type of tumour that affects the brainstem.\n\nBecause this sort of tumour is located deep in the brain, it is inoperable, and no treatment is known as of yet.\n\nMost children die within one to four months of diagnosis.\n\nVictoria explained how frustrating it was to know that her child suffered from a disease with no cure. She also added her son looked 'completely normal,' making it harder to accept his prognosis.\n\nThe young mother said she felt 'selfish' for putting her son through treatment that will buy them more time together\n\nShe went from doctor to doctor in hopes of finding a second opinion, but was given the same answer by all: there was nothing they could do to help Kyle.\n\nNow faced with the reality of her son's prognosis, Victoria admits she's feeling angry with the world, and wants to set up her own charity to raise funds for research into brain tumours.\n\nKyle is starting radiotherapy today in order to buy himself and his family a few more months together.\n\nA Just Giving page was created to fund Kyle's last wish of visiting Lapland and meet Santa with his family. So far, 389 donours gathered \u00a310,132\n\nVictoria said she felt her life was 'falling apart' after Kyle's diagnosis. Survival chances for this particular tumour are zero percent\n\nVictoria recalled a traumatic first appointment on September 23, where she had to watch her son scream from behind a window as he was fitted with a radiotherapy mask.\n\nThe mother said she had then questioned whether she was putting her son through hell for her own selfish motivations.\n\n'I thought to myself \"why the hell am I putting you through this?\"\n\n'What, so I can get a few extra months with you. Is that selfish? I don't know?'\n\nAfter Kyle is done with his treatment, he will attend school two days a week and do what he wants the rest of the time.\n\nA Just Giving page has been set up in order to fund Kyle's last wish.\n\n389 donours gatherer \u00a310,132 in order for the youngster to travel to Lapland with his family to meet Santa", "description": "Victoria Lizzy Morrison, from Hertforshire, discovered her son Kyle, 8, has an incurable brain tumour after being asked to collect him from school when the right side of his face started drooping.", "authors": ["Claire Toureille For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/11/19390404-0-image-a-14_1570443881120.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
