As players, we have quite a bit of power to be able to make a stand, which is what both teams did in that moment, so I commend them for it.\n\n'Hopefully it gets the right attention now to work towards a solution to rid society, the game and the world of this type of abuse.'\n\nThe incident, over which two men have since been arrested, came during another depressing weekend for football just days after England players were abused during their Euro 2020 qualifier in Bulgaria.\n\nThe FA Cup tie against Yeovil had to be abandoned after the alleged racism on Saturday\n\nManchester United have issued an indefinite ban to a spectator who was ejected from Old Trafford during Sunday's 1-1 Premier League draw with Liverpool over alleged racist abuse, while there were also allegations of discriminatory comments by Salford and Bristol City fans over the weekend.\n\nIn addition, Scottish Premiership club Hearts have launched an investigation amid claims that Rangers striker Alfredo Morelos was targeted on Sunday.\n\nThe Premier League's No Room for Racism campaign will be featured at the Amex Stadium when Brighton host Everton this Saturday, and Ryan is hoping the message will get through.\n\nThe Premier League is displaying its 'No Room For Racism' campaign at matches this season\n\nHe said: 'We're human beings before we're footballers. Football is a game of emotions and both the supporters and us as players can get caught up in that sometimes.\n\n'You just have to try to avoid doing things that warrant consequences. Hopefully the people involved in this incident realise the harm it can cause to an individual and we can use it as a step towards getting rid of these sorts of things.'", "description": "The players of both Haringey and Yeovil walked off the pitch on Saturday after it was claimed Pajetat had been spat at and that defender Coby Rowe was subject to racist abuse.", "authors": ["Pa Sport Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/12/20080418-0-image-a-59_1571829462872.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
