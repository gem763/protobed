He will be eligible for parole after serving a term of three years and eight months.\n\nHis final avenue of appeal is to the high court. In their application of appeal to the court, Pell\u2019s lawyers, led by Bret Walker SC, said the appellant division of the supreme court was wrong when it dismissed Pell\u2019s first appeal in August by a majority of two judges to one. \u201cThere did remain a reasonable doubt as to the existence of any opportunity for the offending to have occurred,\u201d that application said.\n\nProsecutors lodge documents opposing George Pell's high court appeal Read more\n\n\u201cThe majority [of judges] erred by finding that their belief in the complainant required the applicant (Pell) to establish that the offending was impossible in order to raise and leave a doubt.\u201d\n\nLast week the director of the office of prosecutions, Kerri Judd QC, filed a response to Pell\u2019s team and challenged their grounds of appeal altogether, urging the high court to refuse to hear his arguments.\n\n\u201cThe [special leave to appeal] identifies no error in the majority approach and no question of law for this court to resolve; it does no more than ask this court to substitute for the view taken by the majority and the jury a different view of the evidence,\u201d her response said. She added that the appeal decision \u201craises no question of law of public importance\u201d.\n\nCardinal George Pell to appeal to high court over child sexual abuse conviction Read more\n\nBut on Monday, Pell\u2019s team filed their reply to Judd, saying she had failed to address \u201cthe question whether belief in a complainant can coexist with reasonable doubt due to the burden and standard of proof\u201d. In order for the Crown to have successfully argued that Pell\u2019s alibi witnesses, including his master of ceremonies Charles Portelli, were unreliable, the Crown should have eliminated \u201cany reasonable possibility that their evidence was true and correct\u201d, Pell\u2019s legal reply states. They argued that failure to produce this evidence should have sparked reasonable doubt in the jury during his trial.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of any challenge to the correctness (let alone honesty) of that recollection by the prosecution at trial, the \u2018alibi\u2019 was not, on proper application of the law, anywhere near eliminated,\u201d the reply states.\n\nA decision is yet to be made by the court as to whether the appeal will be heard.", "description": "Legal team says there does remain a reasonable doubt of any opportunity for the offending to have occurred", "authors": ["Melissa Davey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fc195a77909f5ad8dd86b35afc1223c8371f9ec/0_91_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a522cf89767830edbaa335dd463a6e76", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
