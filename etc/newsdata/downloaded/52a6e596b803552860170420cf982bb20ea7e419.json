I\u2019m so f------ glad we got Osuna!\u201d Apstein reported Taubman as saying towards the three women upon noticing the purple bracelet.\n\nWORLD SERIES: WHY HOUSTON ASTROS OWNERS RECEIVED $70M DISCOUNT TO BUY THE TEAM\n\nAstros pitcher Roberto Osuna didn\u2019t have much of an impact against the New York Yankees during Game Six on October 19. In fact, the closer actually let a two-run home run in the top of the ninth to tie the game.\n\nOsuna was arrested in Toronto, where he played for the Blue Jays before being traded to Houston, after assaulting the mother of his child back last year, and Apstein\u2019s reporting of Taubman\u2019s words caused quite the uproar.\n\nThe Astros initially denied their assistant GM said such an insensitive and pointless comment, claiming Taubman was simply \u2018supporting the player during a difficult time,\u2019 according to Apstein\u2019s report.\n\nWHY NATIONALS' WORLD SERIES RUN COULD LEAD TO A NEW STADIUM NAME\n\nThe Astros released in a statement on Monday, calling Apstein\u2019s professionalism into question.\n\n\"The story posted by Sports Illustrated is misleading and completely irresponsible,\" the statement read. \"An Astros player was being asked questions about a difficult outing. Our executive was supporting the player during a difficult time. His comments had everything to do with the game situation that just occurred and nothing else -- they were also not directed toward any specific reporters. We are extremely disappointed in Sports Illustrated's attempt to fabricate a story where one does not exist.\"\n\nBut then Yahoo Sports' Hannah Keyser, who was amongst the other two female reports alongside Apstein during Taubman\u2019s career-ending outburst, corroborated her story, forcing owner and chairman Jim Crane\u2019s hand in admitting the SI reporter was indeed correct in her reporting.\n\n\u201cAstros owner Jim Crane sent me a letter on Saturday retracting the team\u2019s original statement about my story. \u2018We were wrong,\u2019\u201d Apstein tweeted on Sunday, along with the letter from Crane.\n\n\u201cStephanie, on behalf of the entire Astros organization, I want to personally apologize for the statement we issued on Monday October 21st. We were wrong and I am sorry that we initially questioned your professionalism. We retract that statement, and I assure you that the Houston Astros will learn from this experience. Sincere regards, Jim Crane - Owner and Chairman \u2013 Houston Astros,\u201d the brief letter read.\n\nHOUSTON ASTROS ENTER WORLD SERIES AS BIGGEST FAVORITES SINCE 2007, ODDSMAKERS SAY\n\nThe Astros officially fired Taubman on Wednesday, ESPN reported.\n\nThe 24-year-old relief pitcher signed a one year, $10,200,000 contract with the Houston Astros, including $10,200,000 guaranteed, and an annual average salary of $10,200,000. In 2020, Osuna will earn a base salary of $10,200,000, while carrying a total salary of $10,200,000, according to Spotrac.com.\n\nJim Crane and a group of investors purchased the team back in 2011 for a reported price of $680 million, however the previous Astros ownership and MLB officials collaborated to reduce Crane\u2019s purchase price by $70 million, with each side covering $35 million, making the discounted price $610 million.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The owner of the Houston Astros apologized to a female sports reporter after calling her professionalism into question.", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/AP19297745401327-1-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
