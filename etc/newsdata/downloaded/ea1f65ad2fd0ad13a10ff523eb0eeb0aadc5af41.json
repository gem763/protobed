In May, \u201cParasite\u201d won the Palme d\u2019Or at the Cannes Film Festival, a first for a Korean film. Jury president Alejandro I\u00f1\u00e1rritu said it was a unanimous decision. At a time of endless divineness, everyone can seemingly agree: \u201cParasite\u201d is great.\n\n\u201cWhen I wake up and see the Palme d\u2019Or trophy, it\u2019s very curious and strange,\u201d the 49-year-old director said in an interview by phone from Seoul.\n\nBut for most, there was nothing odd about Bong\u2019s win. \u201cParasite,\u201d a class satire about two families - one of poor hustlers living in a subterranean dwelling subsisting on their wits and stolen Wi-Fi, the other wealthy and residing in a stylish modern mansion - has been roundly hailed as a masterwork and a culmination of Bong\u2019s already illustrious career as a filmmaker of mischievous genre subversions, stylistic daring and warm-hearted sincerity.\n\nThose qualities may sound almost contradictory but that\u2019s exactly the kind of head-spinning amalgamation you get in a Bong Joon Ho movie. They - and in particular \u201cParasite\u201d - balance humor and horror, satire and sincerity with a magical ease. You never see anything coming. You might even giggle at his cunning. You\u2019ll laugh as he devours you.\n\n\u201cI try to be a like a parasite. I try to burrow and dig into the audience\u2019s minds,\u201d Bong says. \u201cI love the feeling of infiltrating into the audience without them knowing. Instead of showing-off that I\u2019m breaking the rules of genre, I want to creep into them quietly without making any blood so that they don\u2019t realize that I\u2019m inside them.\u201d\n\nThat mastery of audiences, combined with a childlike sense of wonder and an ecstatic imagination (Bong\u2019s previous film, \u201cOkja,\u201d featured glorious \u201csuper pigs\u201d) has made Bong one of the few filmmakers who live up to the label of \u201cSpielbergian.\u201d His ardent supporters include Tilda Swinton, Jake Gyllenhaal and Quentin Tarantino, who attended the Cannes premiere of \u201cParasite.\u201d His devoted fans have adopted the proud moniker of the \u201cBong Hive.\u201d\n\nAnd for the Bong Hive, times are good. \u201cParasite\u201d is poised to be that rare thing: a foreign language movie capable of drawing big crowds in theaters and contending at the Academy Awards. South Korea has already made it its foreign language film submission, and the film is predicted to be in the mix in categories including best picture and best director.\n\n\u201cWe have huge ambitions for the film,\u201d says Tom Quinn, founder and chief executive of Neon, which is distributing \u201cParasite\u201d in the U.S. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a multiple-category contender in this year\u2019s Oscars race.\u201d\n\nSuch a release might give Bong the kind of moment with American moviegoers that he hasn\u2019t exactly been missing, but has thus far often been marred by distraction.\n\nHis English-language debut \u201cSnowpiercer,\u201d while it eventually emerged as an art-house hit, was tarnished by the attempted meddling of producer Harvey Weinstein. Bong was able to ultimately rebuff Weinstein\u2019s efforts to cut 20 minutes and add monologues, but it damaged the movie\u2019s release, which was ultimately overseen cut-free by Quinn\u2019s Radius label.\n\n\u201cOkja\u201d (2017), Bong\u2019s biggest budget film at $57 million, became enveloped in controversy as a Netflix release in Cannes, a festival that has since outlawed movies without a theatrical release from its main competition. And, besides, Bong is best experienced on the big screen.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a spectacular visionary but he\u2019s also a humanist,\u201d says Quinn. \u201cIt\u2019s a magic trick. You keep sticking your hand in the hat and out comes another rabbit. It continues to unfold in a way that is so unexpected.\u201d\n\nSince his 2006 breakthrough \u201cThe Host\u201d (a delirious hybrid of a monster movie and family drama) Bong has long been sought after by Hollywood with offers he\u2019s regularly dismissed. He\u2019s written all seven of the movies he\u2019s directed.\n\n\u201cEspecially after \u2018The Host,\u2019 with my previous agency, there were many proposals about directing films of that kind, even superhero films,\u201d says Bong. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. There are many great superhero films. I have respect for them. But I guess it\u2019s a personal paranoia. Superheros always wear a clingy spandex. I can\u2019t stand to be in skin-tight clothes. Watching them is even suffocating to me, so I don\u2019t think I can direct one.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Bong has found his greatest worldwide success by going home, and making \u201cParasite\u201d in his native South Korea. He first came up with the film\u2019s premise in 2013, initially imagining it as a play with the stage divided between the two houses. He drew partly on his experience as a college student teaching private lessons for the middle school boy of a rich family. In the film, the dirt-poor Kim family first infiltrates the wealthy Park clan when the son (Choi Woo Shik) is hired to tutor the Parks\u2019 daughter. (Unlike his character, Bong didn\u2019t have to con his way into his tutoring job. But he only lasted three months.)\n\nIt\u2019s also a personal film for Bong because he connects it with his late mentor, director Kim Ki-young. Kim was a kind of godfather to the filmmakers of the New Korean Cinema of the 2000s; his 1960 film \u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d considered one of the great Korean films, also dealt with class and centered on a two-story house. (Bong also cites what he calls his favorite crime movie, Claude Chabrol\u2019s \u201cThe Ceremony\u201d and the 1963 British classic \u201cThe Servant\u201d as \u201cParasite\u201d inspirations.)\n\n\u201cParasite\u201d completes a kind of accidental trilogy for Bong of capitalism satires. \u201cSnowpiercer\u201d was a high-speed science-fiction parable about the lower-class section of a train carrying all of humanity rebelling against the train\u2019s upper-class in the front. \u201cOkja\u201d depicted a duplicitous global food corporation. In \u201cParasite,\u201d Bong wanted to contemplate the divisions between haves and haves-not more intimately, at home.\n\n\u201cFor a creative mind, it\u2019s natural to make their art about the time that they\u2019re living in,\u201d says Bong. \u201cWe kind of deny that capitalism is such a big part of our time.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Even as it's just hitting U.S. theaters, Bong Joon Ho's \"Parasite\" is already a major award-winner and a box-office smash.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jake Coyle"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/09/bong_joon-ho_portrait_session_43725_c0-215-5135-3208_s1770x1032.jpg?128680a54c6014f5bd990668649899dcbc0b9887", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
