But wayward feral pigs have stoked concern that Kim Jong Un\u2019s reclusive state is hiding an African swine fever disaster.\n\nFive wild boars were found dead in or near border areas separating the two countries this month before being tested positive for the viral hemorrhagic disease, officials in South Korea said. The finding reflects the freedom with which animals roam the 4-kilometer (2.5 mile) wide buffer zone that divides the nations and creates an involuntary park and refuge for fauna.\n\nIt also hints at a spillover of the deadly virus from North Korea, where unofficial reports indicate the disease is spreading out of control. South Korea has deployed helicopters to disinfect parts of the 250-kilometer-long border-barrier, near which more than a dozen outbreaks have occurred on farms since the virus was first reported there a month ago.\n\nAfrican swine fever has spread to almost all areas of North Korea, and pigs in the western province of North Pyongan have been \u201cwiped out,\u201d said Lee Hye-hoon, who chairs the National Assembly\u2019s intelligence committee, citing South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service.\n\nThe virus killed 22 hogs in May on a cooperative farm about 260 kilometers north of Pyongyang, near the border with China, North Korea\u2019s agriculture ministry said in a May 30 report to the World Organization for Animal Health, or OIE.\n\nBut since then, there have been no follow-up reports to the Paris-based veterinary body, and scant coverage of the event in state media.\n\nUN Delegate\n\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization has no information beyond the report received by the OIE, said Wantanee Kalpravidh, the United Nations agency\u2019s Bangkok-based regional manager of the Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases. The FAO is awaiting approval to send a delegate to North Korea, she said in a text message Friday.\n\nWidespread transmission of African swine fever, which isn\u2019t known to harm humans but kills most pigs in a week, may put North Korea\u2019s food security in graver jeopardy.\n\nCrop production there is forecast to be smaller than usual for the rest of 2019 due to below-average rainfall and low water supplies for irrigation, the FAO said last month. About 40% of the population, or 10.1 million people, are estimated to be food-insecure and in urgent need of food assistance, according to results from an UN assessment conducted last April.\n\nWorse Hunger\n\nAfrican swine fever will worsen hunger and malnutrition, said Cho Chunghi, who fled North Korea in 2011 after spending a decade working for the government\u2019s animal disease control program. Many North Korean households raise pigs to earn money to buy rice.\n\n\u201cPork accounts for about 80% of North Korea\u2019s protein consumption and with global sanctions taking place, it\u2019s going to be hard for the country to find an alternative protein source,\u201d said Cho, who now works as a researcher at Good Farmers, a Seoul-based non-governmental organization that supports developing nations to generate profit through agricultural activities.\n\n\u201cThe virus is extremely destructive as people are now unable to make money through raising pigs, while the country\u2019s economy is restrained,\u201d he said.\n\nPigs raised by individual farms outnumber those on state-owned and collective farms, which will make it almost impossible to halt the spread, especially given North Korea\u2019s inexperience preventing and mitigating epidemics in animals, Cho said.\n\nRussia, China\n\nThis lack of capacity is a threat to the entire Korean Peninsula, where the virus could become endemic, or generally present. That would make it more difficult to stamp out the disease through the usual steps of quarantining and culling diseased and vulnerable livestock. From there, it could also re-enter neighboring China and Russia.\n\nSouth Korea has culled 154,653 pigs at 94 farms as of Oct. 11, according to the nation\u2019s agriculture ministry. Routine tests for the virus on wild boars were introduced before Pyongyang reported the outbreak, the Ministry of Environment said in an Oct. 9 statement. Now, streams and soil near the border are also being tested.\n\nThe country has repeatedly asked Pyongyang to join a collective effort to fight the transmission, but its northern neighbor hasn\u2019t responded.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- By official accounts, the pig contagion wreaking havoc across Eastern Asia has virtually skipped over North Korea, with a single outbreak reported there in May.
