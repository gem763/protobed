The gig economy, the temptations of social media and the high expectations millennials have of themselves contribute to this trend, behavioral finance experts say.\n\nAdd to that record student debt levels, the cost of health care, slow wage growth and little work-life balance, and you have a recipe for emotional exhaustion.\n\n\u201cMillennials have this double whammy of anxiety coupled with a really strong work ethic,\u201d says Kit Yarrow, a consumer psychologist and professor emerita at Golden Gate University. \u201cBefore they even get started, millennials approach their tasks in life with a [base] level of anxiety, which depletes their resources for managing stress.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss: How one millennial managed to save almost $1 million in 10 years without ever earning a salary of more than $75,000\n\nThis is not to say \u201cadulting\u201d is especially difficult for this generation or to assume that all millennials are struggling. But understanding how burnout harms financial decision-making can help you or a loved one break through it and achieve goals.\n\nBurnout tricks the mind\n\nBurnout isn\u2019t the same as stress.\n\nThe World Health Organization, which added burnout to its handbook of recognized health conditions this year, says symptoms include \u201cfeelings of energy depletion or exhaustion; increased mental distance from one\u2019s job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one\u2019s job; and reduced professional efficacy.\u201d\n\nBurnout is linked to your job, but it can also affect your financial decisions outside of work in the following ways:\n\nYou pay more for convenience. You could be spending money regularly on takeout, Uber rides or grocery delivery, for example.\n\nPeople are often willing to pay more for convenience because they\u2019re exhausted \u2014 from working multiple jobs, long hours or being available for work all the time \u2014 and because it makes mundane tasks easier, says Theresa Stevens, 26, a financial coach who works with millennials at Declutter Your Money in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nYou splurge as a reward. \u201cTreat yourself\u201d isn\u2019t just a hashtag; it can be a coping mechanism. When it comes to rewarding ourselves, \u201cour mind tricks us into taking us off the hook,\u201d Yarrow says.\n\n\u201cYou might think: I already have student loans and credit card debt and my rent is half my income so I might as well go out and eat, because what difference will it really make?\u201d Stevens says.\n\nSocial networks and the ease of online shopping make it harder to resist temptation, says Mariel Beasley, co-founder of the Common Cents Lab, a behavioral science research lab at Duke University that focuses on improving financial well-being for low- and middle-income households.\n\n\u201cWe see the food people are getting at fancy restaurants, the cute new shoes they bought or the places they\u2019re traveling to,\u201d Beasley says. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing their spending; rarely do we see what they\u2019re saving.\u201d\n\nHow to break through burnout\n\nYou can\u2019t fix the economy or wish away debt. But by recognizing burnout, you can make things easier on yourself. Here\u2019s how:\n\nKnow your \u201cwhy.\u201d Your values motivate you when you\u2019re paying off debt or saving for a dream vacation. They can also help you prioritize what you\u2019re willing to spend money on and cut back on.\n\nValues aren\u2019t the same as goals. Paying off a credit card is a goal, but achieving financial freedom is a value, Stevens says.\n\nBudget strategically. Budgeting isn\u2019t about cutting out the small things that give you joy, like the occasional Uber UBER, -2.03% or your latte habit.\n\nSee: What does a \u2018middle-class\u2019 budget really look like in today\u2019s economy?\n\nTaking a big step to save money \u2014 think moving into a cheaper living situation, refinancing your student loans or canceling subscriptions \u2014 is more sustainable in the long run than, say, resolving to eat out less, Beasley says.\n\n\u201cEvery day when you\u2019re making a decision to spend less, it\u2019s hard to keep going,\u201d she says. \u201cWe naturally bounce back to our old habits.\u201d\n\nSee: Millennials are not like everybody else \u2014 here\u2019s why\n\nAfter you\u2019ve identified your values, a budget is a tool to help you live them. The 50/30/20 budget, which divides spending into needs, wants and savings, is a good place to start.\n\nChannel money motivation. When you\u2019re feeling motivated, take a one-time action that will save you effort, Beasley says.\n\nSet up a small transfer \u2014 perhaps 5% of your income \u2014 to a savings account so the money is out of sight, out of mind. Or cut up a credit card (but don\u2019t close the account) to make it a little harder \u2014 but not impossible \u2014 to buy things you don\u2019t value.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:", "description": "Face it, millennials.
