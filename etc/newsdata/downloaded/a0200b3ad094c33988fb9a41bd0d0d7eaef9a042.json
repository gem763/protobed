Add Interest\n\nABC News has learned that the two-page memo, written by the whistleblower a day after Trump\u2019s call, suggests that at least one aide to the president feared that Trump\u2019s own words in the call were damning. According to a rough transcript of the call released by the White House, Trump asked Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to launch an investigation into a political opponent, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, and his son.\n\nThe notes were based on a brief conversation between the whistleblower and the White House official and described \u201chighlights\u201d from the president\u2019s call. The document was later provided to the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, who reviewed the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. The IG has determined the complaint \u201cappeared credible\u201d and of \u201curgent concern.\u201d\n\nKevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nThe White House had not responded to a request for comment. Trump has defended the call as acting on his duty as president to end corruption \u201ceven if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens,\u201d Trump tweeted Oct. 4. This does have to do with their corruption!\u201d\n\nTrump also has dismissed the whistleblower\u2019s account of the phone call because he says the complaint was based on second-hand information. According to the IG report, the individual had both first and second-hand information. This week a second whistleblower has come forward with what that person\u2019s lawyer describes as first-hand knowledge.\n\n\u201cThe President urged Zelenskiy to investigate the Bidens and stated that [Trump's personal attorney Rudy] Giuliani would discuss this topic further with Zelenskiy during his trip to Kyiv,\u201d the unnamed White House official told the first whistleblower, according to the notes.\n\nSaul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images, FILE\n\n\"The official, who listened to the entirety of the phone call, was visibly shaken by what had transpired and seemed keen to inform a trusted colleague within the U.S. national security apparatus about the call,\" the whistleblower writes in the memo.\n\nThe memo states the official \"described the call as \"crazy,\" \"frightening,\" and completely lacking in substance related to national security.\"\n\nAfter the call, the whistleblower says \"I ... returned to my office, and wrote up my best recollection of what I had heard.\" The person notes that they did not review the call transcript or written notes, \u201cbut the official informed me they exist.\u201d\n\nThe official recalled to the whistleblower that the president also asked the Ukranian leader about \"Crowdstrike server\" a reference to a debunked theory that Ukraine is holding Hillary Clinton's missing emails, and that it was the Ukraine, not Russia, that was behind the interference in the 2016 election.\n\nThe White House official also correctly recalled that the president raised the issue of Burisma holdings, a company that employed Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden.\n\nImportantly, the whistleblower also documented suspicions from the White House official that notes or transcripts from the call were being protected in an unusual manner. ABC News has reported that the White House changed its practice of storing phone call transcripts with foreign leaders to avoid leaked by keeping them in secure servers with restricted access. It was unclear if those conversations, however, were being protected for reasons of national security or for political reasons.", "description": "A White House official listening to President Donald Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president described the call as \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cfrightening.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/trump-rt-jt-191007_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
