(Samantha Pell/The Washington Post)\n\nAs soon as Park View football tryouts ended this summer, alumna Hilarie Burton got on the phone with Principal Kirk Dolson.\n\n\u201cHow many kids? How many kids? How many kids?\u201d the actress best known for her role as Peyton Sawyer on \u201cOne Tree Hill\u201d and a former host of MTV\u2019s \u201cTotal Request Live\u201d said she asked. \u201cIt would suck if no one showed up, but the kids showed up.\u201d\n\nOne year after Park View was forced to cancel its varsity season after only 18 players showed up for tryouts, the Loudoun County team is back. Park View now has 74 players, and it will field a varsity and freshman team, thanks in part to the efforts of the community and a social media campaign spearheaded by Burton.\n\n\u201cIt was not a matter of, \u2019Oh, kids just don\u2019t like football\u2019 or kids are too attached to their phones,\u201d said Burton, who graduated from Park View in 2000. \u201cThis absolutely was financial. It was a financial roadblock that, once we removed it, they all showed up.\u201d\n\n[As high school football offenses evolve, defenses trade size for speed to catch up]\n\nLast year, Burton filed paperwork with other alumni to form a nonprofit called Project Patriot, a group for Park View and other local schools to raise money for extracurricular activities. The intent for the football team was to provide financial support for students who might want to play but were unable to because of high equipment and other costs.\n\nAt an unveiling ceremony Thursday, the announcement was made to students and members of the football team that the NFL Players Association and its OneTeam Collective partners donated $10,000 for the team to get new cleats. Former Washington Redskins running back Clinton Portis also was at the event.\n\nPark View was one of three local schools to cancel its varsity football team last season, joining Manassas Park and Bladensburg. Park View and Manassas Park have brought back their varsity teams this year. When reached for comment, a Bladensburg official said she \u201cbelieved they would\u201d field a team.\n\nPark View and Manassas Park will meet in Park View\u2019s home opener Sept. 13. Park View begins its season at Falls Church on Sept. 6.\n\n\u201cAt this time last year, my gut was hurting because it was one of the hardest decisions we\u2019ve ever had to make, and to see all of these kids come out \u2026 you see these guys fired up. They are excited,\u201d said Park View Coach Josh Wild, who will have at least 20 players on the team who are new to the sport. \u201cWe got a long way to go on the football team, but we\u2019re getting stronger every day.\u201d\n\nThe return of Park View\u2019s varsity team comes after high school sports participation dropped for the first time in three decades in 2018. High school football participation is down 100,000 players since 2010, according to NFHS data. In the past decade, it\u2019s down 9 percent overall.\n\n[High school sports participation drops for the first time in 30 years]\n\n\u201cIt just shows everybody else that you can do it,\u201d Wild said. \u201cThe kids are there. We spent the offseason doing everything we could.\u201d\n\nPark View\u2019s resurgence mimics that of Centennial, the Maryland school that could only field a junior varsity team in 2017 but managed to have a varsity team in 2018. Park View Athletic Director Jason Testerman said he called Centennial\u2019s school office last year to ask questions about how it brought its team back.\n\n\u201cWe basically hit the reboot,\u201d Testerman said.\n\nIn addition to the gift from the NFLPA, Project Patriot netted more than $15,000 as part of a T-shirt campaign, in addition to individual donations that were used to purchase 300 student backpacks and a new mascot costume.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m about baby steps,\u201d Burton said. \u201cIf we are going to do it, we are going to do it right.\u201d\n\nRead more from Post Sports:\n\nFootball Top 20: St. John\u2019s, Gonzaga lead first rankings of 2019\n\nHigh school football notebook: St. John\u2019s, facing its toughest schedule yet, wants \u2018all the smoke\u2019\n\nGet to know the top high school football players in the D.C. area\n\nA year after losing its team, this Maryland high school is bringing football back", "description": "The Loudoun County high school canceled its season last year after only 18 students went out for the team.", "authors": ["Samantha Pell", "Reporter Covering High School Sports", "Samantha Pell Covers High School Sports For The Washington Post.
