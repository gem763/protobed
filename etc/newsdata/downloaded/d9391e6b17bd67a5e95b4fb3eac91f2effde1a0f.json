It was originally listed for $250million and then reduced to $150million. It has now finally sold at $94million\n\nAt $94million, the 38,000-square-foot, 12-bedroom house includes luxurious amenities, such as this massage room\n\nInside the mega-mansion lies a candy room (pictured) filled with $200,000 worth of treats and several foosball tables\n\nNext to the candy room, guests can walk to the property's private bowling alley (pictured) with custom-made furnishings\n\nThe home was originally on the market for $250million but was dropped to $150million earlier this year and then $94million\n\nTwo wine and champagne cellars (one of which is pictured) house bottles carefully selected by owner-builder Makowsky\n\nMakowsky oversaw every single detail inside the property and wanted to created 'the greatest feeling' one can get at home\n\nHandbag tycoon and owner-developer Bruce Makowsky dreamed up the extravagant property, drawing inspiration from his own glamorous lifestyle, so he could flip it and sell it on to a wealthy owner.\n\nHandbag tycoon and owner-developer Bruce Makowsky dreamed up the extravagant property, drawing inspiration from his own glamorous lifestyle, so he could flip it and sell it on to a wealthy owner.\n\nMakowsky also included a car collection worth $30million, made up from a variety of vehicles including 1930s roadsters and 21st century supercars.\n\nThe mogul also added 130 works of art, and topped his billionaire's paradise with a helicopter.\n\nAt one stage, the listing for the property on Zillow was hacked online.\n\nThe hackers went so far as to adjust the sale price and then post notice of an open house for the property - something that would be highly unusual for a luxury listing with such a high price tag.\n\nAn unknown Zillow user with a Chinese IP address and fake phone number managed to get around the site's security measures and tinkered with the sale prices lowering the cost to $110million, then $90.54million, then $94.3million.\n\nMakowsky started getting calls from colleagues congratulating him on the sale, and soon after, he sued Zillow, seeking $60million in damages and citing permanent harm to the property\u2019s perception since it was still listed at $150million.\n\nMakowsky had lowered the price himself several times since placing the property on the market in January 2017.\n\nHe had initially claimed that an asking price of $150million was 'realistic' for a sale but there were still no takers.\n\nHandbag tycoon and owner-developer Bruce Makowsky dreamed up the property, inspired by his own glamorous lifestyle\n\nThe house also comes with a collection of 130 works of art and a garage filled with expensive vehicles (pictured at the back)\n\nAn extravagant James Bond-themed, $2million screening room (pictured) can sit 40 guests on Italian leather reclining chairs\n\nInside the home is this Hermes Equateur Blanket, made out of cashmere and hand-embroidered with fine beads and pearls. It has been encased between starfire glass panels with custom-made standoffs\n\nAlso included in the art collection is this stainless over-sized Leica camera sculpture made by artist Liao Yibai\n\nInside the property is this sculpture by Gale Hart, who has produced several gun-themed works of art over the years\n\nThe owner of the property will enjoy these Lamborghini clock walls and vintage gas cans and fire extinguishers from 1892\n\nA Hobie Cat is displayed next to the infinity pool, in keeping with other nautical nuances scattered around the estate\n\nTwo more of Gale Hart's firearm-themed works of art can be found in a different part of the extravagant, artsy property\n\nEarlier this year, Zillow falsely showed that the mega-mansion sold for tens of millions of dollars less than its asking price after the listing page was hacked by Chinese hackers\n\nMakowsky, who built his fortune selling handbags on QVC, has sold nine billionaire homes in the past eight years.\n\nHe got the idea for the mega-mansion by watching wealthy travelers invest in yachts.\n\n'Today, people are spending $300million on a boat, and they use it about eight weeks a year,' he told the newspaper. 'Then they are living in a $30million to $40million home.'\n\nThe Times notes that only a handful of local LA residents and a small number of people outside of the market even have the ability to buy homes that are more expensive than $100million.\n\nAt last count, there were 680 billionaires in the U.S. and around 2,750 globally.\n\nOn the roof sits the original helicopter from the TV show Airwolf, which ran from 1984 to 1987. The helicopter was refurbished over twelve months and customized to incorporate the luxurious details of the house\n\nRock on! The home even has a couple of rock royalty guitars displayed inside cases as part of its incredible art collection\n\nThe house also comes with this installation that looks like a pinball machine but is actually a Veuve Clicquot-themed artwork\n\nIt took more than 250 people to build the massive Bel Air property, which has panoramic views of the Los Angeles area\n\nThere is also a garage filled with 12 luxury vehicles, including a $15million-plus Von Krieger 1936 Mercedes 540 K Special Roadster and a $2million one-of-a-kind Pagani Huayra\n\nMakowsky believes the home will appeal to a rich homebody who won't want to venture outside too much - and will be able to work out at home in the fitness center\n\nThe tycoon never held an open-house and instead only showed the property to restricted groups\n\nOnly one of the world's estimated 2,750 billionaires could possibly afford the home - maybe one of the 680 who live in the US\n\nMakowsky thought this didn't make sense and resolved to build a property akin to a luxury yacht, but on land.\n\nIt took four years and more than 250 people to finish the $150million home which was originally listed for $250m. Makowsky picked every last detail, including the Champagne bottles store in both wine cellars.\n\nThe television in the entertainment room takes up almost 30 feet, while the James Bond-themed, $2million screening room can sit 40 people on Italian leather reclining chairs.\n\n'I wanted to redefine what super-high-end luxury homes are all about,' Makowsky told CNBC. 'I wanted to break all the molds. The level of quality and attention to detail in this house is unsurpassed. And I wanted to create the greatest feeling that you can have being at home.'\n\nThe property also has a garage filled with 12 luxury vehicles, including a $15-million-plus Von Krieger 1936 Mercedes 540 K Special Roadster and a $2million one-of-a-kind Pagani Huayra.\n\nBefore the sale, Makowsky said he believes the mega-mansion's occupant will have homebody propensities, someone who will be too busy enjoying their billionaire haven to explore the area.\n\n'People spend over half their lives in their home,' he told CNBC. 'So when you're home, it should be the ultimate oasis. You should have every single entertainment feature you could have in one home.'\n\nAt $94million, the property is L.A. County\u2019s third most expensive home sale this year.
