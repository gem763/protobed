(AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s agriculture secretary said during a stop in Wisconsin that he doesn\u2019t know if the family dairy farm can survive as the industry moves toward a factory farm model.\n\nU.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue told reporters Tuesday following an appearance at the World Dairy Expo in Madison that it\u2019s getting harder for farmers to get by on milking smaller herds.\n\n\u201cIn America, the big get bigger and the small go out,\u201d Perdue said. \u201cI don\u2019t think in America we, for any small business, we have a guaranteed income or guaranteed profitability.\u201d\n\nPerdue\u2019s visit comes as Wisconsin dairy farmers are wrestling with a host of problems, including declining milk prices, rising suicide rates, the transition to larger farms with hundreds or thousands of animals and Trump\u2019s international trade wars.\n\nWisconsin has lost 551 dairy farms in 2019 after losing 638 in 2018 and 465 in 2017. USDA data\n\nWisconsin, which has long touted itself as America\u2019s Dairyland, has lost 551 dairy farms in 2019 after losing 638 in 2018 and 465 in 2017, according to data from the state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection. The legislature\u2019s finance committee voted unanimously last month to spend an additional $200,000 to help struggling farmers deal with depression and mental-health problems.\n\nJerry Volenec, a fifth generation Wisconsin dairy farmer with 330 cows, left the Perdue event feeling discouraged about his future.\n\n\u201cWhat I heard today from the secretary of agriculture is there\u2019s no place for me,\u201d Volenec told reporters. \u201cCan I get some support from my state and federal government? I feel like we\u2019re a benefit to society.\u201d\n\nGetting bigger at the expense of smaller operations like his is \u201cnot a good way to go,\u201d said Darin Von Ruden, president of Wisconsin Farmers Union and a third-generation dairy farmer who runs a 50-cow organic farm.\n\n\u201cDo we want one corporation owning all the food in our country?\u201d he said to reporters.\n\nPerdue said he believes the 2018 farm bill should help farmers stay afloat. The bill reauthorizes agriculture and conservation programs at a rough cost of $400 billion over five years or $867 billion over 10 years. But he warned that small farms will still struggle to compete.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult on an economy of scale with the capital needs and all the environmental regulations and everything else today to survive milking 40, 50, or 60 or even 100 cows,\u201d he said.\n\nPerdue held a town hall meeting with farmers and agricultural groups to kick off the expo. The former Georgia governor seemed to charm the crowd with his southern accent and jokes about getting swiped in the face by a cow\u2019s tail.\n\nJeff Lyon, general manager for FarmFirst Dairy Cooperative in Madison, asked Perdue for his thoughts on Trump\u2019s trade war with China.\n\nTrump\u2019s administration has long accused China of unfair trade practices and has imposed escalating rounds of tariffs on Chinese imports to press for concessions. The administration alleges that Beijing steals and forces foreign companies to hand over trade secrets, unfairly subsidizes Chinese companies and engages in cyber-theft of intellectual property. China\u2019s countermoves have been especially hard on American farmers because they target U.S. agricultural exports.\n\nSee: Farmers\u2019 loyalty to Trump tested over new ethanol rules they say favor Big Oil\n\nFrom the archives (April 2016): Wisconsin primary may not be Trump\u2019s Waterloo, but the state is worth watching\n\nAccording to a September analysis by the U.S. Dairy Export Council, American dairy solids exports to China fell by 43% overall in the 11 months starting in July 2018, when China enacted the first round of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. dairy products. About 3.7 billion pounds of U.S. farmers\u2019 milk had to find other markets during that span, the analysis found.\n\nChinese leaders have said they\u2019re ready to talk but will take whatever steps are necessary to protect their rights.\n\nPerdue responded to Lyon\u2019s question by calling the Chinese \u201ccheaters.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey toyed us into being more dependent on their markets than them on us. That\u2019s what the problem has been,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t expect to come into our country freely and fairly without opening up their markets.\u201d\n\nThe secretary said the Trump administration is working to expand other international markets, including targeting India, Thailand, Vietnam, Japan and Malaysia. He said he had expected Congress to ratify a new trade agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada to replace Nafta but noted that Washington has been distracted over the last few days, an allusion to impeachment proceedings against Trump ramping up last week.\n\nRead on: Trump blames stock-market drop on impeachment effort but says he\u2019ll cooperate with Pelosi, Schiff", "description": "\u2018In America, the big get bigger, and the small go out,\u2019 says Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS628_perdue_ZG_20191003163341.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
