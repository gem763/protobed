(AP) - The Chicago Bears are cautiously optimistic quarterback Mitchell Trubisky will return from a left shoulder injury this week.\n\nTrubisky says he feels \u201cclose\u201d to 100 percent and hopes to return when the Bears host the New Orleans Saints on Sunday.\n\nIf he is not ready, coach Matt Nagy says veteran Chase Daniel will make his second straight start.\n\nThe No. 2 overall pick in the 2017 draft, Trubisky was hurt scrambling on the opening drive in the win over Minnesota on Sept. 29. The Vikings\u2019 Danielle Hunter dragged him down, and the quarterback\u2019s non-throwing arm got pinned under his body.\n\nDaniel finished that game and started the loss to Oakland in London the following week. The Bears (3-2) then had a bye.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Chicago Bears are cautiously optimistic quarterback Mitchell Trubisky will return from a left shoulder injury this week.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Andrew Seligman"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/10/bears_bye_football_66410_c0-126-3035-1896_s1200x700.jpg?03ae5ee4eb26ea608d703b29380274420f4e2f49", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
