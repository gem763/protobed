But it is not the sinister, antidemocratic cabal of his fever dreams. It is, rather, a collection of patriotic public servants \u2014 career diplomats, scientists, intelligence officers and others \u2014 who, from within the bowels of this corrupt and corrupting administration, have somehow remembered that their duty is to protect the interests, not of a particular leader, but of the American people.\u201d\n\nAnd there you go\u2026\n\nKeep in mind, this is the same New York Times that back in March of 2017 ran a headline about Trump that said, \u201cWhat Happens When You Fight a \u2018Deep State\u2019 That Doesn\u2019t Exist.\u201d\n\nBut not only is the Times reversing itself, the Times is also asking others in this glorious Deep State to join the anti-Trump conspiracy:\n\nFiona Hill, Michael McKinley and the whistle-blower who effectively initiated the impeachment investigation \u2014 when these folks saw something suspicious, they said something. Their aim was not to bring down Mr. Trump out of personal or political animus but to rescue the Republic from his excesses. Those who refuse to silently indulge this president\u2019s worst impulses qualify as heroes \u2014 and deserve our gratitude. \u2026 For the sake of the nation, the American public should be clamoring for more patriots to join the conspiracy.\n\nIt was only a couple of months ago when the far-left Washington Post finally confessed to the reality of a Deep State and did the exact same thing\u2026 Told us how incredibly awesome it is.\n\nHave you noticed how this always works the same way with Donald Trump\u2026?\n\nWhat I mean is, Trump will fire off an accusation, the media freak immediately out over it and declare Trump a lying, un-American conspiracy theorist; and then after the accusation is revealed as valid, the media end up admitting Trump was correct, but that it\u2019s no big deal.\n\nIt works like this\u2026\n\nAnyone who believes the Deep State exists is a stupid rube spreading conspiracy theories!\n\nTo\u2026\n\nOkay, there\u2019s a Deep State, but it\u2019s glorious and necessary.\n\nOr\u2026\n\nHow dare Trump accuse the Obama administration of spying on him!\n\nTo\u2026\n\nOkay, yes, the Obama administration spied on Trump and for that we should all be grateful.\n\nOr\u2026\n\nHow dare Trump try to scare everyone into passing his legislation with phony claims about a crisis along the border!\n\nTo\u2026\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t Trump do something about this crisis on the border!\n\nOr\u2026\n\nTrump smearing Hunter Biden without evidence is McCarthyism!\n\nTo\u2026\n\nThis evidence against Hunter Biden could hurt Joe Biden.\n\nNevertheless, even by its own laudatory definition of a Deep State, the Times is still admitting the Deep State is un-American, un-democratic, and at war with the American people.\n\nThis sentence right here gives the whole game away: \u201cThose who refuse to silently indulge this president\u2019s worst impulses qualify as heroes \u2014 and deserve our gratitude.\u201d\n\nFirst off, it is not the job of unelected bureaucrats and civil servants, people who can never be fired or held accountable, to decide what is and is not a \u201cworst impulse.\u201d\n\nThese bureaucrats have one job, and that is to honor the democratic process by instituting the agenda of the American president.\n\nWhen the Deep State betrays Trump, the Deep State is actually betraying America\u2026 In the only nationwide vote this country takes, we chose Trump, and by extension, his policies and vision for the country. The idea that a secret, faceless cabal of unaccountable bureaucrats can betray our vote is appalling and un-American.\n\nIt is up to the voters to decide which \u201cworst impulses\u201d are indeed worst impulses, not the Deep State.\n\nSo for those of you keeping track of all the precious norms violated by the Resistance Media, you can now add the New York Times championing the idea of the American people being ruled by people we do not know, have not elected, and cannot remove from office.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
