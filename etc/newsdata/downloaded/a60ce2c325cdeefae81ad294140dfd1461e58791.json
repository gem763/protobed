(Oct. 8) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, is scheduled to testify Thursday in the House impeachment inquiry about President Donald Trump urging Ukraine to investigate his political rival while withholding military aid.\n\nWhen the top U.S. envoy in Ukraine called such a trade-off \"crazy,\" Sondland assured him there was no quid pro quo, according to texts revealed during the investigation. Sondland later acknowledged that he called Trump before sending the reply.\n\nSondland is expected to defend himself Thursday before the three committees investigating Trump by saying he spoke with the president between those texts and relied on his assurances. Sondland's deposition under subpoena comes more than a week after the State Department blocked his voluntary appearance before the panels.\n\nSondland, a major Trump donor turned diplomat, is at the heart of the allegation that Trump had a back-channel foreign policy for Ukraine that involved his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, seeking to discredit former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump urged Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 call to investigate Biden.\n\nUS Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland addresses the media during a press conference at the US Embassy to Romania in Bucharest on on Sept. 5, 2019.

Hill also said Bolton wasn\u2019t part of whatever deal Sondland and White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney \u201care cooking up,\u201d according to AP.\n\nTexts between diplomats questioning Ukraine policy were released as part of the investigation's testimony from Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine.\n\n\"Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\" William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, asked in a text message to Volker and Sondland on Sept. 1.\n\n\"Call me,\" Sondland texted back.\n\nTaylor texted again Sept. 9: \"As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\"\n\nSondland responded that the assertion was \u201cincorrect\u201d about Trump\u2019s intentions. \u201cThe President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,\u201d he said in a text message.The Washington Post reported Oct. 12 that Sondland called Trump between Taylor's text and his own reply and that the message came from the president.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., declared a formal impeachment inquiry Sept. 24 after reports about the Trump call to Zelensky. Trump has blasted the investigation as a partisan witch hunt. The White House has notified Pelosi that the administration won\u2019t cooperate. And Trump said he was justified in urging Ukraine to fight corruption.\n\nSondland\u2019s appearance before he three committees focusing on Ukraine \u2013 Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform \u2013 comes after lawmakers have spent weeks interviewing current and former administration officials.\n\nMore: Republicans complain about limited access to closed-door impeachment investigation sessions\n\nBesides Sondland\u2019s testimony, the committees are seeking messages on his personal electronics that could shed light on Trump\u2019s relations with Ukraine. The text messages or emails were provided to the State Department, but not to Congress, according to Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif.\n\nThe State Department directed Sondland not to testify Oct. 8. The marching orders came the same day the White House notified Pelosi that the administration wouldn\u2019t cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. Trump tweeted that he didn\u2019t want Sondland to go before a \u201ckangaroo court.\u201d\n\nBut in a statement sent through his lawyers, Sondland said he looks forward to testifying and that he \u201chas at all times acted with integrity and in the interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nTaylor is scheduled to meet with the committees Tuesday.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/17/impeachment-ambassador-gordon-sondland-testify-trump-ukraine-policy/4001258002/", "description": "Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, will testify in the House impeachment inquiry about President Trump's policy in Ukraine", "authors": ["Bart Jansen", "Nicholas Wu", "Published A.M.
