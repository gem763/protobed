An appeal based on ineffective counsel resulted in a second trial, where a state medical expert testified in 2016 that she thought the baby had been violently shaken, causing fatal brain damage. Clark then got 40 years for second-degree murder.\n\nDefense attorney Jim Waide argued that scientists have cast doubt on this \"syndrome.\" Tuesday's ruling agreed that the state witness didn't provide support for her findings.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal, http://djournal.com", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
