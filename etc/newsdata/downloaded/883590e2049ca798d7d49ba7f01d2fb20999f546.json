They\u2019re standing at the riverbank where Walt ultimately shot Mike in season five, episode seven.\n\nFour episodes later, in season five, episode 11, was when Jesse first voices desire to move to Alaska and start over.\n\nJesse: So, I get to pick where I go? Alaska.\n\nNarrator: Now we see this was originally Mike\u2019s idea.\n\nMike: Alaska.\n\nNarrator: When we cut to Skinny Pete and Badger, Pete\u2019s complaining about Cheeto dust on his video-game controller, a reference to one of Walt\u2019s jobs at Jesse, when he said that:\n\nWalt: Smoking marijuana, eating Cheetos, and masturbating do not constitute plans in my book.\n\nNarrator: To dispose of Todd\u2019s El Camino, Jesse calls on Old Joe, the loveable scrapyard owner who once helped Walt and Jesse destroy their RV.\n\nJoe reminisces about the magnet scheme from the season five premiere, when he helped Jesse use a giant magnet to destroy Gus Fring\u2019s laptop.\n\nJoe: Magnets.\n\nJesse: Yeah, b\u2014-! Magnets!\n\nNarrator: We see the first signs of what could be a return to the old Jesse when he puts on Skinny Pete\u2019s beanie, echoing his look from earlier seasons. We see the storefront of Twisters, the actual Mexican fast-food joint where they filmed the scenes set in Los Pollos Hermanos, Gus Fring\u2019s restaurant and drug front.\n\nWe also see the strip mall where Saul Goodman\u2019s office was located. Saul\u2019s law firm has apparently been replaced by Duke City Sports Bar.\n\nOn his car radio, Jesse hears news that Texas authorities are investigating:\n\nRadio: The poisoning of a Houston woman. Are looking into her possible connection to Walter White\u2019s criminal organisation.\n\nNarrator: The woman in question is Lydia, the neurotic executive based in Houston who was a key coconspirator of Gus and then Walt.\n\nIn the series finale, Walt poisoned Lydia by swapping in ricin for her tea sweetener.\n\nWalt: I slipped it into that Stevia crap that you\u2019re always putting in your tea.\n\nNarrator: After the radio discusses the fallout from the collapse of Walt\u2019s drug ring, there\u2019s news that the NASDAQ is down.\n\nRadio: The Dow Jones is down 15 points. The NASDAQ is down 34 points.\n\nNarrator: A reference to Walt\u2019s famous \u201cI am the one who knocks\u201d speech from season four.\n\nWalt: Do you know what would happen if I suddenly decided to stop going into work? A business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly-up.\n\nNarrator: There are several lingering shots of the intersection between Holly Street and Arroz Street, a shout-out from \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d creator Vince Gilligan to his wife, Holly Rice. \u201cArroz\u201d means rice in Spanish.\n\nIn his search for Todd\u2019s money, Jesse first tries to check in between the walls, which is exactly where Walt used to hide his stash.\n\nJesse also checks underneath the sink, which is where he tucked his own stash of meth back in season two, episode 12. This is a frequent hiding place in the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d universe. In episode seven of \u201cBetter Call Saul,\u201d Mike finds the Kettlemans\u2019 money tucked away in the very same spot.\n\nIn this flashback scene, Todd compares his apartment colour scheme to:\n\nTodd: Easter eggs.\n\nNarrator: Giving a heads-up to the many Easter eggs hiding in each room. One of the shirts he has lying around says \u201cVamonos Pest,\u201d the bug-extermination company where he used to work. That\u2019s how Jesse and Walt initially met Todd in season five.\n\nTodd retrieved this tarantula off the body of Drew Sharp, the little boy that he carelessly killed in season five.\n\nThe arrangement of the \u201cStar Trek\u201d figures inside the spider\u2019s terrarium evokes the arachnid scene from \u201cUSS Callister,\u201d the \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d episode in which Jesse Plemons played Robert Daly, an antisocial villain not unlike Todd.\n\nNear the spider\u2019s cage is a creepy snow globe, which contains toy versions of Todd and Lydia inside a teacup. Todd always had an obsession with Lydia, and from his meeting with her at the coffee shop, he knew she loved her chamomile tea.\n\nOnce we learn that Todd strangled his housekeeper, Sonia, we can see one possible reason why Jesse opted to choke Todd to death instead of shooting him in the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d finale.\n\nNext up, the scene where Todd casually lets a truck pass him on the road could be an allusion to the 1971 Spielberg movie \u201cDuel.\u201d\n\nThen, when Jesse goes to fetch Todd\u2019s cigarettes from his glove compartment, the name on the pack is Morley, a fake brand that has appeared in scores of TV shows and movies.\n\nBack in the present timeline, Jesse splits up Todd\u2019s money with Neil, one of the fake cops that he runs into at the apartment. But as they part ways, Jesse catches a glimpse of the logo on Neil\u2019s truck: Kandy Welding Co. Jesse recognises the name from his time in captivity. As we soon see in a flashback, Kenny, Jack\u2019s second-in-command, enlisted the Kandy Welding Co. to install extra precautions so that Jesse could never escape.\n\nJesse then goes looking for Ed, the vacuum salesman who helps criminals like Walt and Saul pull disappearing acts and assume new identities. When Jesse pulls up at Ed\u2019s store, Best Quality Vacuum, and recognises his red minivan parked outside, he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s in the right place.\n\nJesse: I am 96% sure that you are the guy.\n\nNarrator: 96% sure, he says, a reference to the purity level of the meth he once cooked.\n\nWhen Jesse\u2019s searching his parents\u2019 house for a gun, his eye is drawn to the crawl space on the floor. \u201cCrawl Space\u201d was in fact the title of season four, episode 11. Clarence, the stripper\u2019s driver and body guard for the Kandy Welding party, may look familiar to fans of \u201cBetter Call Saul.\u201d\n\nHe appears in two episodes of season four as Man Mountain, the muscle Saul recruits to scare off a group of teenagers in episode six, and then as a bodyguard that Pryce considers hiring for protection in episode nine.\n\nThe actor, David Mattey, confirmed this connection in a tweet.\n\nAs Jesse waits for the Kandy Welding party to end, he crouches down and lets a beetle crawl on his finger, just as he did in season two, episode six. Both moments signify Jesse\u2019s compassion for people and creatures that others might easily stomp out or discard.\n\nThe ensuing flashback with Walt seems to be set in the season two episode \u201c4 Days Out,\u201d when Walt and Jesse embark on a weekend-long cook session. That means that Jesse\u2019s phone conversation must have been with Jane, his girlfriend at the time.\n\nJesse: Do you miss me?\n\nNarrator: Walt and Jesse eat at a diner that has two miscolored tiles on its floor, matching the arrangement of the show\u2019s title logo. The final scene of \u201cEl Camino\u201d shows Jesse starting his new life in Alaska.\n\nThe licence plate on his car reads \u201cThe Last Frontier,\u201d similar to Alaska\u2019s real state motto, \u201cNorth to the Future.\u201d\n\nBefore Jesse drives off, though, he hands Ed a letter addressed to a Brock Cantillo in Albuquerque.\n\nBrock is the son of Jesse\u2019s ex-girlfriend Andrea. Until now, we could never quite be sure of Brock\u2019s fate. Jesse\u2019s captors had threatened to kill the boy like they killed his mother whenever they thought Jesse might try to escape.\n\nAs for the appearance of Jane, Jesse\u2019s other former girlfriend, we\u2019ve actually seen this flashback before. It was shown in season three, episode 11, long after Jane had died.\n\nThe scene takes place during Jesse and Jane\u2019s trip to the Georgia O\u2019Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe.\n\nJane: I\u2019ve gone where the universe takes me my whole life. It\u2019s better to make those decisions for yourself.\n\nNarrator: Jane\u2019s talking about the importance of deciding your own destiny. It\u2019s fitting, then, that the film closes on a shot of Jesse at the driver\u2019s wheel, mirroring the shot of him escaping at the end of the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d finale.\n\nNow, though, he\u2019s clean, calm, and possibly even optimistic about the future. It looks like Jesse Pinkman may finally get his happy ending after all.\n\nDid we miss anything?
