It is used for situations deemed serious but not life-threatening.\n\nThe 245 passengers and eight crew had hoped to reach Montreal on September 17 but their journey was cut short after 37 minutes.\n\nAn incident report issued by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) said no one was hurt during the bizarre incident.\n\nBut the odour came from a shipment of durian, a tropical fruit known for being \"the world's smelliest fruit\".\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nThe unique smell has been known to trigger powerful disgust responses in others, with their smell being likened to rotting onions, turpentine, and even raw sewage.\n\nAir Canada has been approached for comment.\n\nIt comes after an Indonesian plane was grounded after the smell of durian reportedly sparked a brawl in the cabin.\n\nIn this case, the fruit was said to have been stored in the forward cargo hold of the plane.\n\nAfter landing, the shipment was offloaded with the aircraft returning to service 20 hours after the original departure time.", "description": "The Air Canada pilots on the Boeing 767 took flight ROU1566 back to Vancouver after they couldn't get rid of the foul smell", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Toronto Star Via Getty Images", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20533240.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Air-Canada-Rouge-Airbus-A319-Inaugural-Flight.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
