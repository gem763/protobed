Wasp interrupts mortal combat between two snakes in Florida (VIDEO)", "language": "en", "text": "One horrified Gainesville, Florida resident went to investigate a ruckus in her backyard and happened upon a bizarre battle: two snakes fighting upside down while a yellowjacket wasp stung one of the surly serpents.\n\nEvangeline Cummings initially assumed the strange rustling in her rose bush was a dead hanging snake. But before she could fully investigate, she spotted another snake weaving its way towards the tree, before climbing up and attacking its serpentine sibling, at which point she began filming.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before a yellowjacket wasp joined the bizarre and violent backyard brawl.\n\nUm ok, \u2066@UFEntomology\u2069 and \u2066\u2066@MartaWayneUF\u2069 , I believe I just witnessed a BEE \ud83d\udc1d stinging a CORAL SNAKE \ud83d\udc0d while the CORAL was dining on a RAT (?) SNAKE \ud83d\udc0d and I need your support to process this. \u2066\u2066@UF\u2069 #FloridaBackyardpic.twitter.com/djbJJGxaUk \u2014 Evangeline Cummings (@EvieCummings23) October 17, 2019\n\nCummings\u2019 video has been viewed 51,400 times on Twitter alone and sparked fierce debate about what possessed the coral snake, which typically lives underground, to not only head out in broad daylight but also climb a tree.\n\nBy the way, I have this footage too from later that same day when the coral made its next attempt from the ground. (Seeing this rose bush moving all \u201cby itself\u201d drew me back outside to check it out!!) So the coral survived any wasp sting! And wasps seem to still be present. pic.twitter.com/Dk1z7GWpnr \u2014 Evangeline Cummings (@EvieCummings23) October 21, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, herpetologist Emily Taylor from the California Polytechnic State University believes the wasp did in fact sting the snake, based on its extra wiggling. Yellowjacket wasps are notoriously (and needlessly) aggressive, and have been the subject of urban legends and online memes for years.\n\nMany academics weighed in on the ferocious fight but among the general public, the consensus was one of revulsion.\n\nLike this story?
