Zaid, a prominent national security lawyer in Washington and a Trump critic on Twitter, has joined the legal team representing the intelligence community whistleblower who is targeting President Trump.\n\nThe legal reinforcement in a media-political frenzy not seen since the 2017 Trump-Russia brouhaha signals a tough battle ahead for the White House and the Justice Department.\n\nMr. Zaid\u2019s law partner, Bradley P. Moss, is counterattacking conservatives who have vilified the unidentified whistleblower. He called the Trump supporters \u201chuman excrement posing as human beings.\u201d\n\nMr. Zaid is joining the whistleblower\u2019s existing legal counsel, Andrew P. Bakaj, himself a vindicated whistleblower from his CIA days. Mr. Bakaj once did counseling work on Capitol Hill for Democratic Sens. Hillary Clinton and Charles E. Schumer, the party\u2019s Senate leader, his posted biography says.\n\n\u201cI am now formally part of legal team,\u201d Mr. Zaid tweeted over the weekend. He said Mr. Moss will stay out of the case \u201cso Brad can continue to comment on WB policy/law.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department is blocking the intelligence community inspector general from turning over complaint information to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, headed by Rep. Adam B. Schiff, California Democrat.\n\nMr. Schiff has launched a full-length investigation into nearly every aspect of Mr. Trump\u2019s life. Mr. Schiff enthusiastically supported the 2016 Democratic Party-financed dossier filled with anti-Trump allegations that have since been discredited.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the whistleblower\u2019s information is that Mr. Trump, in a phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, urged an investigation of Joseph R. Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, a global business investor who Republicans say cashes in on his father\u2019s status as a former senator and vice president.\n\nMr. Zaid said in a Twitter post that he won\u2019t discuss the case publicly.\n\n\u201cTo all my reporter friends, no need to reach out & ask questions. No answers forthcoming at this time,\u201d said Mr. Zaid, who offers pro bono defense to intelligence and defense whistleblowers.\n\nMr. Zaid maintains a steady presence on Twitter, where he frequently criticizes Mr. Trump and retweets his critics.\n\n\u201cThe US \u2018media is a joke\u2019 in the world says @realDonaldTrump. How #embarrassing to hear this from a president,\u201d Mr. Zaid tweeted as Mr. Trump went after his favorite target. \u201cHey @FoxNews @Potus didn\u2019t exclude you from that criticism.\u201d\n\nMr. Zaid also has targeted Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal attorney. Mr. Giuliani traveled to Ukraine in an apparent bid to have Hunter Biden scrutinized for the large financial payments he received from a Ukrainian natural gas firm that has been suspected of corruption.\n\nMr. Zaid tweeted: \u201cWhy have @POTUS personal lawyer talk abt subject matter he knows nothing abt factually or legally? These allegations pertain to official acts (& classified) that @RudyGiuliani should not have been briefed on. Nor does he know anything, to my knowledge, abt #whistleblower laws.\u201d\n\nOn the immigration front, Mr. Zaid had this comment on his retweet of a story that claimed archaeological damage if the southern border wall is built: \u201cOf course it will.\u201d\n\nWhen former Trump press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said she is \u201crelentlessly\u201d attacked by women, Mr. Zaid tweeted, \u201cGosh, why would that be?\u201d\n\nMr. Moss, Mr. Zaid\u2019s law partner, is a Twitter combatant who regularly disparages Mr. Trump\u2019s defenders.\n\nMr. Moss asked Mr. Giuliani, \u201cSaturday morning martinis again, Rudy?\u201d\n\nHe tweeted at former acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker: \u201cI hope you\u2019re ready to get sued for defamation for claiming falsely that the whistleblower tried to leak information to the Washington Post.\u201d\n\nWhen former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik questioned the whistleblower\u2019s politics and accuracy, Mr. Moss said: \u201cYou\u2019re a disgrace and an ex-convict yourself. The IC IG \u2014 who was appointed by Trump \u2014 validated the disclosure qualified as an urgent concern. Why don\u2019t you go back to committing tax fraud? You were good at that.\u201d\n\nTo Fox News\u2019 Geraldo Rivera, who called the whistleblower a \u201cpunk,\u201d Mr. Moss tweeted: \u201cget on your knees and beg the whistleblower for forgiveness, you despicable hack. This person followed the law, they reported things within proper channels. They didn\u2019t leak.\u201d\n\nTo Trump supporters, Mr. Moss\u2019 Twitter message is: \u201cThere is a special place in the fiery pits of Hell for \u2018law and order\u2019 conservatives who smear a whistleblower who made a protected disclosure through proper channels as outlined in federal law. They are human excrement posing as human beings.\u201d\n\nMr. Bakaj is the founder and managing partner of Compass Rose Legal Group, whose lawyers include I. Charles McCullough. He was the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general during the Hillary Clinton-State Department email scandal. He expressed criticism of how Mrs. Clinton stored highly classified data on her home computer server.\n\nHe said on Fox News that it didn\u2019t matter if not all documents were marked classified and that what mattered was the information and whether it was indeed secret.\n\nMr. Bakaj also is a veteran of the inspector general corps, working in the CIA\u2019s IG office as an investigator into whistleblower complaints.\n\nHe helped write the procedures for protecting complainants and then found himself under investigation for reporting evidence tampering in 2014.\n\nYahoo News reported that the CIA suspended Mr. Bakaj and stripped him of his security clearance.\n\nThe CIA IG dismissed his retaliation complaint, so he appealed off site to the Department of Homeland Security inspector general\u2019s office. It ruled that Mr. Bakaj was the victim of a CIA \u201cretaliatory investigation.\u201d\n\nBy then, Mr. Bakaj had left the agency and gone into his national security law practice focusing on cases that mirror his personal experience.\n\nHe was represented by Mr. Zaid back then, and it was Mr. McCullough, his current law partner and then the intelligence community inspector general, who asked the Homeland Security Department in 2016 to investigate Mr. Bakaj\u2019s reprisal complaint.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
