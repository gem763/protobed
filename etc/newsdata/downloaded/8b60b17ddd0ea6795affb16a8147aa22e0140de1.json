All he cared about was how much money I was bringing into the household.\n\nI\u2019ve suffered panic attacks and severe anxiety attacks \u2014 but he always dismissed me and told me I was \u2018stupid\u2019 and \u2018doing it all for attention\u2019.\n\nWhen our youngest child was born (she\u2019s now 11), she had severe physical problems (thankfully, she\u2019s OK now) and when I needed his support he would just disappear. While I was living at the hospital with her, he would regularly leave our eldest (then three) with anyone who\u2019d have her.\n\nThought of the day\n\nSo many people had unknown stories lurking: a husband gone, a surprise baby passed off as a brother or sister, a misplaced passion, a lost wife\u2026How to navigate through life carrying such things without them making you sad and bitter and judgmental \u2014 that was the challenge. From A Single Thread by Tracy Chevalier (2019)\n\nI had only ever had one relationship \u2014 being with him since we were 15 \u2014 so had nothing to compare this relationship with. Once our youngest was OK, he withdrew from family life unless he absolutely had to be present \u2014 and I did 99.9 per cent of everything, domestically and emotionally.\n\nMy severe pain (I\u2019m still on several medications) made me unable to have sex, so he deemed me not to be worthy of his time.\n\nUnknown to me, he decided to have at least one affair. After 22 years together (and married for over 11 years), he texted me \u2014would you believe? \u2014 11 days before Christmas five years ago to say he was leaving, as I was \u2018no longer a contributor to society\u2019. I\u2019m on benefits because of my medical problem.\n\nHe has come to my house and caused trouble and threatened other people involved with us \u2014 so to cut a long story short, the courts have now decided he is no longer allowed to see the girls.\n\nHis behaviour throughout the relationship was controlling, but I didn\u2019t see it until he was no longer with us.\n\nPeople are now telling me that five years since he left I should \u2018move on\u2019 and find another man. But, honestly, the children and I are doing so fantastically and they are flourishing at school. I am really proud of them for overcoming what they have been through.\n\nMy question to you is: do you think that I am weird or abnormal because I am so happy on my own with my kids and family around us, or do you think that I should try to seek out a special someone else?\n\nI know this doesn\u2019t seem like a big problem, but strangely it is becoming bigger in my head as the time passes.\n\nMANDY\n\nThis week Bel advises a woman who says she is happy on her own, while a man wonders if he wife his repelled by him\n\nWho are these \u2018people\u2019? It always amazes me that folk are so ready to offer opinions on the lives of others: what they should do, whom they should love, whether they should have another baby, and so on.\n\nYes, writing a column like this requires offering opinion \u2014 but then I only do so because I have been asked!\n\nA woman of my acquaintance once divested herself of the opinion (framed as a question) that I had been \u2018too forgiving\u2019 towards my ex-husband. Really! Luckily, I was too polite to suggest she mind her own business.\n\nYou have been through various stages of hell, with your own health, a sick child, a selfish, neglectful, controlling and unfaithful husband, and then his behaviour resulting in the court decision.\n\nBut without this man your life has become calmer and you see how much happier your daughters are without their father. So I wish \u2018people\u2019 would leave you alone and let you develop the life you have \u2014 rather than the life they think you should be chasing after.\n\nYour letter raises two issues that interest me greatly. The first is (as I\u2019ve just outlined) why people believe they have a right to offer opinions without reflecting on the hurt they might cause.\n\nI suspect social media has made this tendency worse. Yes, humans have always gossiped and offered their two-penn\u2019orths and sniped \u2014 but this is now the norm on a scale nobody could have imagined, and it seems reticence and decorum have disappeared.\n\nFor pity\u2019s sake, people \u2014 don\u2019t busily tell the parents of an only child that they should have another, because they might have tried and failed many times \u2014 or else think one is just perfect, thank you very much!\n\nAnd don\u2019t offer any opinions about a person\u2019s need for another relationship \u2014 because you can have no idea how thrilled he or she might be to hunker down in a cosy solitary bed at night.\n\nA s for you, Mandy, you remind me how much I love to hear from those happy to be independent \u2014 so thank you. Your new life of contentment, of peace after so many storms, will be an inspiration to others who write to me in terrible anxiety about their single state. It\u2019s not always bad, is it?\n\nYou have your girls \u2014 who matter more than anything else \u2014 to focus on and deserve time to think about who you are and what you want. In the future, you may well meet another partner and that might be unexpected or as the result of a concerted effort.\n\nWho knows? What matters is refusing to be embittered by the past and trusting in your ability to create a new future.\n\nMy disabled body repels my wife\n\nDear Bel\n\nThe simple question \u2014 is my marriage broken? If so, is it broken irrevocably?\n\nI\u2019m a 57-year-old disabled man, confined to a wheelchair, and my disability will worsen with time. Each day, my dependency on others intensifies and I see myself as a burden on my wife, family and friends.\n\nThese feelings are magnified by my wife\u2019s coldness. No longer are there any spontaneous acts of real romance, and intimacy has ceased.\n\nI haven\u2019t been passionately kissed in over ten years, and we sleep in separate bedrooms. When I ask if she loves me, I am met with silence. I do everything I can to show how deeply I love her. All my approaches for sexual intimacy are rejected \u2014 if I do touch her, she recoils, and her body language screams repulsion.\n\nWhen she wants to make a call, she leaves the room and goes upstairs, knowing I cannot follow. We no longer socialise with family or friends, so my life has become a mere existence without any joy.\n\nI desperately want my marriage to work, but every time I try to start the conversation of what we need to do, I am again met with silence.\n\nI feel she stays only because she worries about what people would think if she deserted a disabled husband. Help.\n\nWILL\n\nThere is no \u2018simple\u2019 answer to your question and the only clear thing is that you are very unhappy and need help. I feel sorry for you, although I realise what you need is some sort of strategy for coping and not just pity.\n\nLet\u2019s just leave the issue of your disability to one side. That may sound unfeeling, but let me explain.\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve received many letters from men full of anguish because their wives no longer wish to have sex.\n\nSnogging tends to end when passion goes to sleep; there\u2019s nothing unusual in that, nor in the painful truth that sexual chemistry fades even in happy marriages. So I want to set your woes within that larger context.\n\nYou say your wife seemed repelled by your attempts to kick-start intimacy. That must do great harm to your self-esteem, so I suggest you avoid it. Oh, I understand why you try, yet since it\u2019s fruitless and damaging I\u2019d try to shift your mindset rather than change her.\n\nI worry that you are becoming depressed, so I suggest you talk to your doctor. It would also be helpful for you to discuss your marriage with experts at Relate (relate.org.uk), but further talking to your wife is essential.\n\nYou say she answers with silence, but perhaps that\u2019s because you are asking the wrong questions. Don\u2019t demand to know if she loves you or anything that will drive her further within herself. Instead, confide that you worry about the future and the burden your increasing disability will lay on her.\n\nYou could address the lack of socialising and try to work out what has happened. Say you would love to see more of family and friends, and perhaps frame this in terms of happy memories of when you were first together. You could emphasise how good it would be for her if you were to invite people round. Neither the lack of sexual intimacy nor your disability are reasons not to see other people.\n\nSurely, this is something you can do something about? Yet not expressed in terms of the marriage being \u2018broken\u2019 (a negative), but instead as a way to create more fun in the future (a positive).\n\nDon\u2019t ask her what\u2019s wrong; frame the talk in terms of what she would enjoy. Try shifting the mood from your sadness and low self-esteem to ways of throwing open your shared life to others.\n\nAnd Finally.....Oh, to be young and revolting!\n\nI\u2019ve heard from jolly people that my reminiscences in last week\u2019s column (wild days on Nova magazine in 1971) reminded them of their own youth, and they loved it!\n\nNaturally, age is very much on my mind this week, since another birthday has just gone \u2014 and watching the reports of Extinction Rebellion demonstrations reminded me most of us get grumpier. (By the way, I omitted the word \u2018climate\u2019 there, because from what I can see the aim has shifted to a blatant \u2018smash capitalism\u2019 . . . good luck with that, guys!)\n\nWhen I was 17, I wore badges for CND and the Movement For Colonial Freedom. Then in 1994, I became involved with a road protest, and experienced the red mist of obsession that cuts you off from other points of view. So I do understand why young people protest, even if I don\u2019t agree with their \u2018why\u2019 and \u2018how.\u2019\n\nIt was ever thus, as Shakespeare said: \u2018Crabbed age and youth cannot live together.\u2019 And I bet you don\u2019t know who wrote this: \u2018Our youth now love luxury. They have bad manners, contempt for authority; they show disrespect for their elders and love chatter in place of exercise; they no longer rise when elders enter their room; they contradict their parents . . . gobble up their food and tyrannise their teachers.\u2019\n\nContact Bel Bel answers readers' questions on emotional and relationship problems each week.
