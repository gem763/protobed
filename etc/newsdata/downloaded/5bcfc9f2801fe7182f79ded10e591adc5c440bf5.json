He is also facing charges for the kidnapping and assault of another 51-year-old woman.\n\nThe 34-year-old was arrested just two days after Ms Jones's body was discovered.\n\nPolice say two of the victims died from blunt force trauma while the bodies of two others were too decomposed to d\n\netermine their cause of death.\n\nWayne County prosecutor Kym Worthy said Martin exhibited the patterns of a serial killer, targeting women in their 50s who were working as prostitutes and leaving their bodies in a kneeling position in abandoned houses with a used condom near by.\n\nShe said: \"I think it's pretty clear that we believe he is a serial killer.\"\n\nSex workers are easy prey for killers because they are already vulnerable and marginalised. Prostitution remains illegal in many places in the United States, making sex workers less likely to report violence or ask police for help.\n\nMartin pleaded not guilty and was refused bail by magistrate Laura Echartea, who called him a danger to the community.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events\n\nThe murders led the police to search more than 4,200 vacant homes.\n\nThere are more than 19,000 vacant addresses in Detroit, down from some 30,000 six years ago.
