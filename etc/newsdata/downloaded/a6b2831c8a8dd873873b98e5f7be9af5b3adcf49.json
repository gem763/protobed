He very simply called the Democrats\u2019 Ukraine impeachment scheme a \u201clynching.\u201d And on cue, the Democrats and their media friends erupted with cries of racism and invoking a darker time in American history.\n\nEven with their years of journalism and English language training, they pushed forward with the insane concept that somehow President Trump was referencing African-Americans being lynched during the civil rights era or after the Civil War. Sure, white people were lynched throughout history as well, but come on \u2014 that doesn\u2019t fit the narrative \u2014 they only covered the African-Americans who were affected.\n\nAccording to the left and their media friends, Mr. Trump was clearly referencing only the talking point that they extrapolated. Sure, Joe Biden, Jerry Nadler, John Kerry, Harry Reid and more called the Clinton impeachment a \u201clynching,\u201d and sure, nearly every Democrat declared what happened to the famous actor Jussie Smollet a \u201cmodern lynching\u201d without retracting it. And sure, almost every left-leaning person has called Mr. Trump \u201cliterally Hitler,\u201d his followers \u201cliterally Nazis,\u201d and migrant detention facilities \u201cliterally concentration camps\u201d \u2014 but according to them, Trump and only Trump is the one attempting to send some sort of \u2018evil message\u2019 drawing upon the darkness and hate of the past with his use of the word \u201clynching.\u201d\n\nThey even went as far as to get Bernice King, a daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., to tweet about Mr. Trump being a racist because of the use of the word. She tweeted that it was \u201ca reflection of the very real trajectory of our nation and the very repugnant evil of racism, which still permeates both legislation and language in the United States.\u201d\n\nMartin Luther King\u2019s daughter. I guess she was too busy to weigh in when Democrats had used the word.\n\nIt just seems that journalists, elected members of Congress and educated liberal elites can\u2019t grasp the concept that the president was simply speaking in hyperbole. Surely, they would have had the training and education to understand when someone uses this common term for an attack on themselves, right? Or perhaps it\u2019s something else.\n\nWho can forget when, a few weeks ago, the president looked to the sky and joking declared that he was \u201cthe chosen one\u201d when it came to dealing with China? If you watched it, you could clearly tell that he was kidding. It was a sarcastic jab at the president and leaders before him who dropped the ball in negotiating with the communist super-power.\n\nBut the media and left somehow took this to mean that he believed he was claiming to have the power of God and was somehow the \u201canti-Christ.\u201d Suddenly, they understood the Christian religion, which they so often blame for other things, to the point that they were able to declare Mr. Trump\u2019s joke as the sign of the end of the world. I could go on and on with examples of this insanity, but I won\u2019t.\n\nThe point is that since Mr. Trump took office, the left and their media friends, the ones who have been trained with a mastery of the English language, have over and over again attempted to take a few words of what Mr. Trump says completely out of context in order to push forward their \u201corange man bad\u201d agenda.\n\nThey know what they\u2019re doing. No one, and I mean no one, can honestly look at Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet where he calls the three-year Democratic investigation into him a lynching and say that\u2019s racist. In that same light, no one could have witnessed Mr. Trump\u2019s sarcastic jab that he\u2019s \u201cthe chosen one\u201d on China and believed that he thought he was the anti-Christ or some godly being.\n\nAt this point the pattern is so old and repetitive that we could predict what happens with certain common words and phrases. If Mr. Trump said something \u201ccost an arm and a leg,\u201d The Washington Post, New York Times, CNN and MSNBC would all run stories that he is advocating for human trafficking and the sale of body parts \u2026 and Snopes would verify it to be true.\n\nAnd if Mr. Trump said \u201cit\u2019s raining cats and dogs,\u201d the same group of media outlets would declare him \u201cinsane\u201d and say that he believes mammals materialize and fall from the clouds \u2014 and therefore he should be removed from office via the 25th Amendment.\n\nThis game is tired and old. Americans are smart enough to figure out the left and their media friends\u2019 game. Heck, at this point, even children and people who don\u2019t speak English have caught on. It didn\u2019t work when they took the president out of context three years ago, and it doesn\u2019t work now \u2014 but unfortunately for everyone except the makers of Tylenol, the left will keep trying this insane strategy over and over again because it\u2019s clear at this point that their political playbook lacks depth, originality or reasonable plans to try to win in 2020.\n\n\u2022 Tim Young is a political comedian and author of \u201cI Hate Democrats/I Hate Republicans\u201d (Post Hill Press).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
