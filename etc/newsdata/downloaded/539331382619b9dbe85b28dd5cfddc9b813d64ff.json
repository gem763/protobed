Some of the scientists he worked with have paraphrased and compiled McCarthy\u2019s best writing advice. It applies to all kinds of writing, from emails to novels.\n\nAs an em dash abuser, I especially liked this tip:\n\nDashes should emphasise the clauses you consider most important \u2014 without using bold or italics \u2014 and not only for defining terms. (Parentheses can present clauses more quietly and gently than commas.)\n\nMcCarthy has more punctuation advice. By advising on how to use different marks, he reveals their purpose and effect on the reading experience:\n\nDon\u2019t lean on semicolons as a crutch to join loosely linked ideas. This only encourages bad writing. You can occasionally use contractions such as isn\u2019t, don\u2019t, it\u2019s and shouldn\u2019t. Don\u2019t be overly formal. And don\u2019t use exclamation marks to call attention to the significance of a point. You could say \u2018surprisingly\u2019 or \u2018intriguingly\u2019 instead, but don\u2019t overdo it. Use these words only once or twice per paper.\ufeff\n\nHe recommends deleting unnecessary commas, and explains how to find them:\n\nCommas denote a pause in speaking. The phrase \u201cIn contrast\u201d at the start of a sentence needs a comma to emphasise that the sentence is distinguished from the previous one, not to distinguish the first two words of the sentence from the rest of the sentence. Speak the sentence aloud to find pauses.\ufeff\n\nMcCarthy isn\u2019t an em dash guy himself\u2014more of a \u201cthree words and a period\u201d guy. His prose style resembles an Ernest Hemingway who has still killed himself but managed to keep writing. But he\u2019s not teaching people how to write like him. He\u2019s teaching them how to write effectively.", "description": "Novelist Cormac McCarthy has spent twenty years editing what feels like the opposite of a novel: scientific papers by faculty members and postdocs at the Santa Fe Institute.
