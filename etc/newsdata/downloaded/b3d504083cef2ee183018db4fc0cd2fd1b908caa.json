There is a lot of work being done in preparation for next Tuesday.\u201d\n\nCrowds more than a thousand strong also gathered for rallies in York, Manchester, Newcastle and Bristol.\n\nOne of the smallest and most northerly rallies was held on Orkney, where around 100 people braved the rain to stage a protest in the town of Kirkwall.\n\nOrkney has just 22,000 residents.\n\nAlena Ivanova, from Another Europe Is Possible, said: \u201cToday\u2019s protests are the beginning of something huge \u2013 they have been inspiring, full of youth and diversity and energy.\u201d\n\nShe said that the daily protests must \u201cgrow into the millions\u201d in \u201cthe centre of every town in the country.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Tens of thousands of protesters\u00a0marched\u00a0across the UK on Saturday, in a show of anger over Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament.
