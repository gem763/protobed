It\u2019s going to take a lot more time and effort to understand what it means to be defining yourself differently.\u201d\n\nDuring the discussion, Chelsea, 39, said she \u201cstrongly supports\u201d transgender children being able to play on the sports teams that match their gender identity.\n\n\u201cI think we need to be doing everything we can to support kids in being whoever they know themselves to be and discovering who they are,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Aitkenhead noted that Hillary looked \u201cconflicted\u201d over her daughter\u2019s comments, The Daily Mail reported.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve got to be sensitive to how difficult this is,\u201d the former presidential candidate said. \u201cThere are women who\u2019d say [to a trans woman], \u201dYou know what, you\u2019ve never had the kind of life experiences that I\u2019ve had. So I respect who you are, but don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re the same as me.\u2019 I hear that conversation all the time.\u201d\n\nAt another point in the discussion, the reporter pointed out that many women of Hillary\u2019s generation are uncomfortable with biological males sharing their bathrooms.\n\n\u201cI would say that, absolutely,\u201d Hillary confirmed.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
