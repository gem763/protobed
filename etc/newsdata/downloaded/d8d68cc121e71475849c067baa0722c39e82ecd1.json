Cole has made a living snapping some of the biggest stars from the world of music.\n\nFrom Drake to Beyonce, the American photographer has captured some of the most iconic moments in music over the past 18 years and has become entwined in the culture that thrives within the hip-hop industry.\n\nHowever, the 43-year-old recently swapped the world of live concerts and after-parties for a seat at one of the meccas of European soccer.\n\nIn a mini-documentary by AS Roma and lifestyle brand Black Arrow FC , Cole traveled to the Serie A giants in March to capture his first-ever European soccer match.\n\nIn doing so, the legendary photographer hoped to provide a different narrative and get more black Americans into the sport.\n\n\"There's no LeBron James playing soccer,\" Cole told CNN Sport. \"All respect to the men that we have in the United States, they're good but they're not great. They're not superstars.\n\n\"There is nobody as marketable or even close to James and we need that. We need to let guys know that there's another way out besides basketball and (American) football.\"\n\nMel D. Cole traveled to Rome to take photos of his first European soccer match.\n\nMel D. Cole\n\nGrowing up in Syracuse, New York, Cole spent his early years around his father's record shop.\n\nAs a result, he became obsessed with hip-hop, reggae, and R&B and assumed he would one day take over the store, but the birth of online music and the death of independent record shops put an end to that dream.\n\nAfter dropping out of high school, Cole went to college in New York City, which proved to be a turning point in his life.\n\nOnce in the mecca of hip-hop, he began to teach himself photography and soon realized the pictures he was taking were worth sharing.\n\n\"Slowly I became more immersed into the culture of New York, the downtown scene,\" Cole told CNN Sport.\n\n\"I met a couple of guys who would take me out and I really started studying what was going on around me.\"\n\nCole wants to better represent the game's black culture.\n\nCareer in music\n\nArmed with what he remembers as a simple four megapixel camera, Cole attended a Kanye West show during the early years of his development.\n\n\"I walked up and I literally just acted like I belonged there and no one said anything to me. I stood there and shot the entire show, \" he said.\n\nWe need more black faces involved not only on the pitch, but also behind the scenes Mel D. Cole\n\n\"Then the confidence was in me, so I just took it and ran with it.\"\n\nAs his career blossomed, Cole started gaining the trust of the biggest names in the industry. With that trust came career defining access into leading artists' lives and a front-row seat to the hip-hop world.\n\nAs his profile grew, he began to branch out and he now works with hip-hop artists on music videos -- his first produced for Trey Songz.\n\n\"You want to have them be comfortable with you and not worry about you doing them wrong,\" added Cole, stating intimacy was key to the success of the pictures.\n\n\"For me it's a privilege and an honor to be able to still do what I do, to still be able to have these artists be comfortable with me.\"\n\nPhotos: Mel D.

THIS IS NOT A GAME! @MLS pic.twitter.com/7keA1kInfk \u2014 Black Arrow (@BlackArrowFC) August 23, 2019\n\n'Embracing black culture'\n\nDolores hopes his approach may even help address the ever-present issue of racism within soccer.\n\nItalian football, in particular, has been marred by racist chanting in recent weeks and black players across Europe have been targeted online.\n\nDolores says clubs need to show more leadership in tackling the issues and praised the current partnership with AS Roma.\n\n\"It's easy to say 'we don't condone that' or 'you shouldn't do this' and that needs to continue,\" he said.\n\n\"But I think the next level of this whole thing is, or a parallel level if you will, is these teams really embracing black culture and highlighting it and promoting it because I think that's the leadership that their fans will follow.\"", "description": "Mel D.
