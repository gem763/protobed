All of those present, including Mr. Obama and Hillary Clinton, were for taking him out. But when Mr. Obama asked Mr. Biden what he thought, he said, \u201cMr. President, my suggestion is don\u2019t go.\u201d\n\nIf Mr. Obama had taken his vice president\u2019s advice calling for more confirmation of bin Laden\u2019s location, the terrorist almost certainly would be alive today, commanding al Qaeda and planning even deadlier attacks than we saw on 9/11.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s lone opposition to taking the necessary action to protect America at the moment when U.S. Special Forces had the chance should alone be enough to disqualify him to be president. But an even more shocking decision by Mr. Biden jeopardizing the security of America has been ignored by the mainstream media.\n\nAs revealed in my book \u201cThe First Family Detail,\u201d that decision was Mr. Biden\u2019s order that the military aide carrying the nuclear football remain at least a mile behind him when he traveled around Wilmington, Delaware, as vice president.\n\nThe nuclear football is a leather-covered titanium business case that weighs 40 pounds. Secured with a cipher lock, it contains a variety of secure phone capabilities and options for launching nuclear strikes that the president may authorize.\n\nThe president authenticates his identity with codes found on a small plastic card he carries with him. In case the president is incapacitated or has died, an identical nuclear football is assigned to the vice president.\n\nSince either leader would likely have 15 minutes or less to respond militarily to an impending attack from a country like China, Russia or North Korea before the United States could be wiped out by nuclear-tipped missiles, the military aides who carry the satchels are supposed to be in close proximity to the two leaders at all times.\n\nBut as soon as Mr. Biden \u2014 code-named Celtic \u2014 took office in January 2009, he laid down a rule: Instead of the usual retinue of at least 15 vehicles preceded by a police escort in his motorcade, whenever he returned home to Delaware, he wanted a Secret Service motorcade of just two \u2014 the limousine or Suburban he rode in, plus a single follow-up Suburban behind him with agents.\n\nMr. Biden specifically ordered the Secret Service control vehicle, which carries the military aide and a doctor, to follow at least a mile behind his limousine.\n\nSince Mr. Biden and his wife, Jill, traveled back to their home at least once a week and sometimes several times a week, that put the country at risk, potentially unable to retaliate against a nuclear attack whenever the second-in-command was traveling in Delaware.\n\n\u201cWhen you go to any city outside Washington, you have a full-blown vice presidential motorcade much like the president\u2019s motorcade,\u201d a Secret Service agent said when Biden was in office. \u201cIts length may be 15, 20, or more vehicles, including for staff and a counter-assault team. But when he\u2019s home in Wilmington, he has told the service \u2014 and for whatever reason Secret Service management bends over and accommodates him \u2014 that he does not want anything other than the limousine he\u2019s in and the immediate Suburban that we\u2019re in. He wants everybody else out of sight. That includes the vehicle with the military aide and the doctor.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the agent said, \u201cYou\u2019ve separated vital assets from the vice president in Wilmington when he\u2019s motorcading around. We are told, \u2018Don\u2019t come near us, don\u2019t let us see you, the vice president doesn\u2019t want to see you.\u2019\u201d\n\nEven in normal traffic, by the time the military aide caught up with Mr. Biden in the event of an attack, it would be too late.\n\n\u201cIf something happens and they\u2019re caught in traffic, you would lose even more precious time,\u201d an agent said.\n\nSecret Service agents say Mr. Biden simply wanted to preserve his image as a regular Joe. Never mind that if Mr. Obama were taken out, the country could have been obliterated by a nuclear attack because of Mr. Biden\u2019s irresponsibility and lack of judgment.\n\nAgents say Mr. Biden seemed to care as much about the safety of his fellow Americans as he cared about the feelings of female Secret Service agents who were offended that he regularly swam naked in front of them at his pool at the vice president\u2019s residence or at his home.\n\nCalling Mr. Biden\u2019s order to keep the nuclear football a mile away from him \u201calarming,\u201d an agent said, \u201cHe wants to be Joe, and he does not want the vehicles around him.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Ronald Kessler, a former Washington Post and Wall Street Journal investigative reporter, is the author of \u201cThe First Family Detail: Secret Service Agents Reveal the Hidden Lives of the Presidents.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
