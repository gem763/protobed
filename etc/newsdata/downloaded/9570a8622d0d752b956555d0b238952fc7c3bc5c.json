Alana Garas told Task & Purpose in an email. \"It did not represent the U.S. Naval Academy's Command Religious Program.\"\n\nNew religious service over at the Naval Academy.... \ud83d\udc79\ud83d\udc79\ud83d\udc79\ud83d\udc79\ud83d\udc79 A post shared by Drunk Old Grad (@drunkoldgrad) on Oct 8, 2019 at 6:21pm PDT Oct 8, 2019 at 6:21pm PDT\n\nAccording to Garas, a group of midshipmen \"with beliefs aligned with those practiced by The Satanic Temple\" (which the US government officially recognized as a tax-exempt religion in May of this year) had requested a space for a \"study group\" to discuss their satanic beliefs \u2014 and not, as the email in question indicated, for holding satanic religious services.\n\n\"The USNA Command Religious Program provides for the exercise of diverse beliefs,\" Garas said. \"Arrangements were being made to provide the Midshipmen with a designated place to assemble as chaplains facilitate for the beliefs of all service members.\"\n\nThe problem with the request isn't the focus on, well, satanism: It's that The Satanic Temple in particular represents, as Garas put it (emphasis ours), \"a non-theistic religious and politically active movement,\" the type of which US military personnel are broadly forbidden from engaging with.\n\n\"The Command Religious Program at the Naval Academy facilitates the opportunity for the free expression of diverse beliefs, but without endorsing any particular belief, [and] Midshipmen have the right to assemble to discuss their beliefs as they choose,\" Garas said. \"But, to be clear, in accordance with Department of Defense Policy, military members will not engage in partisan political activities, and will avoid the inference that their activities may appear to imply DoD approval or endorsement of a political cause.\"\n\nAs of 2017, the US military recognized 221 distinct \"faith groups\" from major religions like the Roman Catholic Church and Islam to more arcane and esoteric affiliations like Druid, Troth, Heathen, and Pagan.\n\nIn January of this year, a group of sailors aboard the aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis conducted religious services based in Norse Heathenry with the approval of their commanding officer.", "description": "The US Naval Academy says an email appearing to announced the availability of \"satanic religious services\" was sent prematurely.", "authors": ["Jared Keller", "Task"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da0b3474af9095fe30b7218?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
