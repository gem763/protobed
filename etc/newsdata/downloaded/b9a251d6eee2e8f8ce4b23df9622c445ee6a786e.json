Trump clearly used public power to ask a foreign leader to dig up dirt on his political opponent. This is impeachable. I don\u2019t see how you can deny the facts in front of your face.\n\nFlyover Man: I haven\u2019t really had time to look into it. There\u2019s always some fight between Trump and the East Coast media. I guess I just try to stay focused on the big picture.\n\nThe big picture is this: We knew this guy was a snake when we signed up. But he was the only one who saw us. He was the only one who saw that the America we love is being transformed in front of our eyes. Good jobs for hard-working people were gone. Our communities in tatters. Our kids in trouble. I had one shot at change, so I made a deal with the devil, and you\u2019d have made it, too.\n\nNothing in this impeachment mess makes me rethink this bargain. If people like you are unable to acknowledge my dignity and see my problems, I\u2019ll stay with Trump.", "description": "An imagined conversation with Flyover Man.", "authors": ["David Brooks"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/03/opinion/03brooksWeb/03brooksWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
