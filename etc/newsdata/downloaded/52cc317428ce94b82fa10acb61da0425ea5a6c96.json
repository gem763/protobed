Yet 16 years ago they suddenly came alive, given belief by Stirling Mortlock\u2019s early try before defending with their lives, allowing George Gregan to ultimately bellow \u201cfour more years\u201d to his crestfallen opponents.\n\nMitchell was axed and later admitted he was too raw to have held the post. After a varied string of coaching appointments, fate led the 55-year-old to join England head coach Eddie Jones as an assistant 12 months ago.\n\nThe picture he has of innovative Australian teams remains, making it difficult to set up a foolproof defensive plan.\n\nMORE RUGBY NEWS\n\nLEADERSHIP: The unseen qualities that make Hooper a great Wallabies captain\n\nTRUCE: Jones and Cheika tipped to end war of words ahead of quarter-final showdown\n\nFIVE THINGS: The good, bad and ugly news for Wallabies fans\n\n\u201cThe first thing that we acknowledge is that the Wallabies are a very clever football team. They will be clever on the weekend,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, having witnessed a number of teams play against Australia ... they have always been highly intellectual in the way that they play the game.\u201d\n\nWallabies coach Michael Cheika has endorsed a ball-in-hand approach in Japan, attracting critics who believe there isn\u2019t enough variety to crack open defences.\n\nMitchell doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s a bluff from the Australians.\n\nHe expects them to do minimal kicking in general play, in turn starving the English of possession.\n\n\u201cThey just love moving the ball -- I think that\u2019s the Australian way as well,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s to me very much their mentality and always has been and always will be.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be a few surprises. Like any defensive system, you cannot defend for all the space but it\u2019s up to Australia to find it.\u201d", "description": "John Mitchell\u2019s last visit to the Rugby World Cup knockout phase ended with a Wallabies ambush that cut short his All Blacks coaching career.", "authors": ["Daniel Gilhooly"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7ea5d1c0a6025f0116625de62751f380?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
