I hope he\u2019ll get it through parliament, I suspect he will but it will be tight.\u201d\n\nCameron was asked about his relationship with Johnson and whether they had nicknames for one another. The former Tory leader said a friend had texted him earlier on Thursday to ask if the new Brexit deal would be voted through parliament, then introduced his greased pig analogy by way of response. Johnson referred to Cameron as a \u201cgirly swot\u201d in papers discussing the prorogation of parliament, leaked documents showed.\n\nFielding questions from the BBC\u2019s James Landale, Cameron said: \u201cAt the end of the day, I think this is quite close to what was talked about in the 2017 manifesto, and it is a way of leaving with a deal, so I think that is the right thing to do.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t go on being stuck. You can\u2019t rule out having a general election if parliament cannot pass this deal and is still stuck, and you cannot rule out a second referendum.\u201d\n\nCameron was speaking at Harrogate\u2019s Crown hotel on the first night of the town\u2019s literature festival.\n\nIn his book Cameron writes that Johnson \u201cdidn\u2019t believe\u201d in Brexit, but backed the leave campaign to further his career. Johnson wanted to become the \u201cdarling of the party\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t want to risk allowing someone else with a high profile \u2013 Michael Gove in particular \u2013 to win that crown\u201d, Cameron claims.\n\nA small group of protesters had formed outside the hotel prior to Cameron\u2019s talk and he was repeatedly interrupted during the event.\n\nAt one stage, as he discussed the reasons for calling the 2016 EU referendum, a woman stood up and shouted: \u201cI think the good people of Harrogate came here to hear an apology from you.\u201d\n\nAs other audience members responded with a mixture of angry boos and applause, a man called out: \u201cApologise for ruining our country.\u201d It came after Cameron had described the three years following the referendum as \u201cvery painful for the country\u201d.\n\nWhile he was discussing ways to unite the country following the division of the referendum, another man interrupted and shouted: \u201cYour policy of austerity did absolutely nothing to bring this country together.\u201d", "description": "Former prime minister says he would vote for the deal on Saturday if he was still an MP", "authors": ["Kevin Rawlinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05f04ea6f26a8e718b7d59b8fb78297e998ad113/0_237_2418_1451/master/2418.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8a9c19d3c5e6fdd437fb2b4ec3056421", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
