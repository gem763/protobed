It has been mired in allegations of sexual abuse by officers ever since it took over running Yarl\u2019s Wood detention centre in 2007.\n\n\u201cPeople in immigration detention are socially and geographically isolated and stripped of basic rights, and vulnerable to abuse by private contractors. We will not be celebrating until Brook House and all other detention centres are shut down.\u201d\n\nThe Home Office said it was in the procurement process and that current bidders had until October to submit their final bids, with the new contract holder to be awarded in February 2020.\n\nA spokesperson for the company said this decision was made \u201cto give greater focus to our custody and rehabilitation business, where we operate four of the highest-rated prisons in England and Wales\u201d.", "description": "Private security firm G4S has announced it will no longer run Brook House removal centre,\u00a0in a move that will bring an end the company\u2019s controversial involvement in the immigration and asylum sector.
