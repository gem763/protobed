Even her hair is dyed red.\n\n\"When I turned 18 or 19 there came a sudden, strong urge to wear red,\" Rebernik told Reuters. \"There must not be a single dot of any other colour on my home decorations or clothes.\"\n\nWearing shades like scarlet and vermillion gives her \"the feeling of strength and power\".\n\nThe only problem is that her husband does not notice when Zorica wears something new.\n\nRebernik's obsession with the colour has made her a local celebrity in her hometown of Breze, close to Tuzla in northern Bosnia.\n\nShe even goes to funerals dressed in red, eschewing traditional black.\n\nAfter four decades dressing in the colour from head to toe, the 67-year-old Bosnian has had tombstones made for herself and husband Zoran - whom she married wearing a red gown - from a special red granite imported from India.", "description": "Zorica Rebernik has spent her life in red and plans to stay that way - even after she dies.
