We\u2019re unhappy with having conceded the goal but in general we were very happy with the performance and now we need to focus to consistently produce this type of performance and get back to winning ways (in the league).\n\n\u201cThe game really lifted us again and it was what we needed. Tactically we got things right and we really need to make the most of that and it was an absolutely incredible intensity we played with. There are many positive points we can take into the game against Norwich.\n\n\u201cThere were some negative points as well, so we need to correct those on the pitch in our day-to-day preparation, but we need to take the positive points to Norwich, have a great game and go for the win.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s match is the second in a run of four successive away matches, with Chelsea following in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday before a league trip to Bournemouth next weekend.\n\n\u201cYou have to work on everything,\u201d Fred said. \u201cYou need to look to improve and have good games every time you play.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m working very hard every day to keep up this form, training hard and doing my best. I know how important every game is and I\u2019m determined to help the team keeping winning.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Fred believes Manchester United\u2018s draw against table-topping Liverpool\u00a0will prove a turning point on both an individual and collective level.
