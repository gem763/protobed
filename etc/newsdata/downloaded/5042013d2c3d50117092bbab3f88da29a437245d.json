We explain why this is the case. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 House Democrats issued subpoenas to the Pentagon and the Office of Management and Budget on Monday \u2014 the latest in a string of such demands as Congress continues to escalate its impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.\n\nThe subpoenas, issued to Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Acting Director of Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought, demand documents pertaining to the delay in military funds to Ukraine \u2014 a key component in the inquiry examing whether Trump used his power to force an investigation by a foreign government into Vice President Joe Biden, one of his key political foes in the 2020 election.\n\nChairmen of the three congressional committees heading the investigation into Trump's contacts with Ukraine and the delay in needed military funding \u2014 Reps. Adam Schiff, Elijah Cummings and Eliot Engel \u2014 asked in the subpoena for documents that could shed light on the sequence of events that led to the delay in funds aimed at countering Russia aggression in the country.\n\nThe committees gave until Oct. 15 to produce the documents and included a warning should officials deny the subpoena.\n\n\"Your failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena, including at the direction or behest of the President or the White House, shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House's impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against you and the president,\" both letter state.\n\nExplainer: Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases\n\nMore: Senator says he was blocked by Trump from telling Ukraine foreign aid was coming\n\nThe documents could help congressional investigators better determine the rationale behind holding up $400 million in U.S. military aid that Trump had put on hold, even after bipartisan congressional approval. The administration has given various explanations, including wanting Europe to provide more funds and being wary of possible corruption within Ukraine's new administration.\n\nDemocrats are investigating whether the administration dangled the money in exchange for Ukraine investigating Biden, one of Trump's primary political opponents, and unfounded theories about Ukraine's role in the 2016 election.\n\nA summary of a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky raised questions about the president's intentions after he brought up Biden and his son, Hunter, after discussing the military aid.\n\nThose questions intensified after a series of text messages were made public last week, showing key U.S. diplomats in the region were wary that the aid and a meeting between the two leaders might be contingent on Ukraine investigating issues that would help Trump politically.\n\nThe subpoenas issued Monday are just the latest in a number of demands Congressional Democrats have made in the last several weeks, including subpoenas issued to the White House, Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nPompeo failed to meet a Friday deadline for documents outlined in his subpoena but is in communication with the committees.\n\nCLOSE Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden responding to the ongoing impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump says President Donald Trump is \"unhinged.\" (Oct. 4) AP, AP\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/07/impeachment-inquiry-pentagon-budget-office-subpoenaed-house-democrats/3898521002/", "description": "House Democrats issued\u00a0subpoenas to the Pentagon and the\u00a0Office of Management and Budget on Monday\u00a0\u2014 the latest in a string of such demands as Congress ratchets up its impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Christal Hayes", "Published P.M.
