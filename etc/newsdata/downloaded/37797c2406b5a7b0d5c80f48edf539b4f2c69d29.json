(Jason Lee/Reuters)\n\nThe most pressing political problem facing China\u2019s leaders this week may not be the ongoing protests in Hong Kong. Nor the protracted trade war with the United States.\n\nNo, it is probably a shortage of pork \u2014 during the Chinese zodiac year of the pig, no less \u2014 that has become so severe that the rulers of the Communist Party declared stabilizing pork supply and prices to be an \u201cimportant political task.\u201d\n\nChinese love to eat pork. Red fried pork. Sweet and sour pork ribs. Glazed pork belly. Twice-cooked pork. Pork dumplings. Trotters. Chinese eat an average of 120 pounds of pork each a year. Half the world\u2019s pork is consumed here.\n\nBut with a slew of holidays coming up \u2014 starting with this Friday\u2019s mid-autumn festival when families get together and feast \u2014 officials are increasingly worried that public discontent will overshadow the celebrations.\n\nThey are particularly concerned that pork shortages will ruin the \u201chappy and peaceful atmosphere\u201d required during next month\u2019s commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, the biggest event on the Communist Party\u2019s calendar this year.\n\n\u201cWe should ensure pork supply by all means,\u201d Vice Premier Hu Chunhua said at the end of last month, adding that China\u2019s pork shortages would be \u201cextremely severe\u201d in the last quarter of this year and the first half of 2020.\n\n\u201cWe must strengthen the guidance and management of public opinion,\u201d he continued, according to a state media account of his remarks.\n\nThe party, under the increasingly iron-fisted leadership of Xi Jinping, has tightened security and further stifled criticism in the lead-up to the anniversary on Oct. 1, which will be marked by a huge military parade.\n\nTo try to mitigate the shortages, Hu declared that the government would release some of its frozen pork supplies. Yes, just as the United States government holds oil in reserve to release in times of crisis, so too does China stockpile pork.\n\n\u201cAs far as the government is concerned, the availability and affordability of food is one of the key metrics people use when answering the question \u2018are you better off now than you were 70 years ago?\u2019\u201d said Andrew Polk, an analyst at Trivium China, a Beijing-based consultancy.\n\n\u201cFor that reason, the Party has a very strong incentive to literally bring home the bacon,\u201d he said.\n\n[Chinese merchants fear Trump\u2019s trade war is hurting a popular snack: Pig feet ]\n\nChina\u2019s porcine problems began a year ago when African swine fever broke out. This led to the cull of almost 1.2 million pigs to stop the spread of the virus, which is highly contagious and fatal in pigs. It is not harmful to humans.\n\nAs a result, China\u2019s pig herd is down one-third from last year, and its pork production has naturally plummeted. Still, three new cases were reported last month, and the virus has spread to Vietnam and the Philippines.\n\n\n\nCustomers shop for pork at a market in Beijing on Sept. 5, 2019. (STR / AFP) / China OUTSTR/AFP/Getty Images\n\nChina produced 54 million tons of pork in 2018, according to official statistics, but is expected to produce only 40 million tons this year. Rabobank, the Dutch financial services company, estimates Chinese pork production will fall further to 34 million tons next year.\n\nThe widespread culls led sudden spike in pork prices. Even since July, pork prices have shot up by 50 percent, reaching record highs of more than $2.25 a pound and easily surpassing the previous record set in 2016.\n\nChina\u2019s version of social media site TikTok is full of memes riffing on the price of pork. In one, a customer buys a tiny piece of meat the size of his thumb. In another, a man walks down the street dangling a large piece of pork from a hook, the carnivorous equivalent of bragging about his Lamborghini.\n\nIn Xinfadi, the biggest meat market in Beijing, vendors and shoppers alike were downbeat.\n\nPork prices had risen in August at the fastest pace that Yu, a vendor in her 50s who has worked in the market for about 20 years, could remember.\n\n\u201cThis had a big impact on my business,\u201d said Yu, who declined to give her full name. She estimated that the number of customers is down by a third compared to this time last year.\n\n\u201cThere are fewer customers now and people cannot afford to buy pork, they say it\u2019s too expensive.\u201d\n\nShang Jinsheng, a 68-year-old retiree who was shopping in the market, said she was buying only half as much pork as she used to, and buying more seafood instead.\n\n\n\n\u201cI used to buy pork every week, now I haven\u2019t bought it for three weeks,\u201d she said. \u201cI am on my way to buy shrimps, I\u2019m just passing by to take a look at the pork prices.\u201d\n\n[It\u2019s the Year of the Pig. Is it also the year fake pork takes off in China? ]\n\nWith the holidays approaching, central and local governments alike are taking action to narrow the gap between supply and demand.\n\nThe southern city of Guangzhou started releasing 1,800 tons of frozen pork reserves onto its local market at the weekend, spreading it out over the days until the Oct. 1 anniversary.\n\nIn Nanning, near the border with Vietnam, residents can buy pork at a 10 percent discount to the market price. But customers are limited to two pounds of the meat a day, and vendors to selling only one pig\u2019s worth.\n\nThe central government has told the provinces they must be pork-self-sufficient. Banks, meanwhile must not only keep lending to hog farms and slaughterhouses, but they should do so at cheap rates.\n\nStill, the government cannot come up with a quick fix.\n\n\u201cThe pigs can\u2019t grow overnight. They need time,\u201d said Sun, a 45-year-old who owns a stall in the Xinfadi market.\n\nTo try to make up the shortfall, China\u2019s pork imports are forecast to almost triple this year. China imports most of its pork from European countries, but also gets some from the United States.\n\nThat makes the trade war with the United States an added challenge. Beijing imposed an additional 10 percent tariff on American agricultural imports in September, taking the duty on imported U.S. pork to 72 percent, and has canceled several large purchases of American pork.\n\nBut the government has tried to minimize the impact of the trade war. One official told state-run television that American pork imports comprise less than 0.2 percent of the Chinese market.\n\n\n\nIn this May 8, 2019, photo, white disinfectant powder is scattered on the ground around buildings at a pig farm in Jiangjiaqiao village in northern China's Hebei province. (Sam Mcneil/AP)\n\nStill, the amount of pork that China imports from the United States has more than halved in the last two years at precisely the time it needs more.\n\nIn the meantime, the authorities are trying to turn consumers away from China\u2019s favorite meat.\n\nThe Life Times, a newspaper affiliated with the Communist Party, even suggested in a front-page special that eating too much pork was not healthy. \u201cEat less pork: both your wallet and your body will thank you,\u201d the publication wrote on Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter.\n\nChina\u2019s Internet users were not impressed. \u201cThis is modern version of \u2018Let them eat cake,\u2019\u201d responded Jiang Debin, quoting the line attributed to Marie Antoinette when French peasants ran out of bread shortly before the revolution. \u201cThey are using so-called expert advice to deceive people, but dare not say don\u2019t eat meat unless you have money.\u201d\n\nLiu Yang contributed reporting.\n\nRead more\n\nAs swine fever spreads, Asian countries cull millions of pigs\n\nAfrican swine fever has decimated China\u2019s hog population.
