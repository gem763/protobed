Instead, I started wearing a watch again. Just because your phone can seemingly do everything, that doesn\u2019t mean it should.\n\nRearrange your apps\n\nTony Stubblebine was the sixth person to be employed at Twitter and is fully aware that the platform was designed with human psychology in mind. Now editor-in chief of the popular Medium publication Better Humans, he recommends sorting your apps into three categories: primary tools, aspirations and slot machines. Primary tools, he says, \u201chelp you accomplish defined tasks: getting a ride, finding a location, adding an appointment. There should be no more than five or six.\u201d He calls aspirations \u201cthe things you want to spend time doing: meditation, yoga, exercise, reading books, or listening to podcasts\u201d. The third category, slot machines, are \u201cthe apps that you open and get lost in: email, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, etc\u201d. \u201cRearrange your phone\u2019s home screen so that it includes only your primary tools and your aspirations,\u201d continues Stubblebine. \u201cIf the app triggers any mindless checking from you, move it to a different screen.\u201d\n\nStop notifications\n\nIn 2013, Apple announced that its servers had sent 7.4trn push notifications. Six years later, few people do anything to avoid those external triggers. According to Adam Marchick, CEO of mobile marketing company Kahuna, fewer than 15% of smartphone users adjust their notification settings, meaning the remaining 85% allow app makers to interrupt them whenever they like. An audible notification is the most intrusive. Ask yourself which apps should be able to interrupt you when you are with your family or in a meeting; I only grant text messages and phone calls this privilege. After sound, visual triggers are the second most intrusive form of interruption. I only allow the red circles on the corner of an app\u2019s icon, and I grant this permission only to messaging services (email, WhatsApp, Slack, Messenger).\n\nHack back email\n\nCut out the spam\n\nSome spammy marketers make it hard to find the unsubscribe button, or keep sending you emails after you\u2019ve opted out. For these, I use SaneBox, a program that runs in the background as I use email. Whenever I encounter an email I never want to hear from again, I click a button to send it to my SaneBlackHole folder. SaneBox\u2019s software ensures that I\u2019ll never hear from that sender again.\n\nSlow down the email ping-pong\n\nThe key to receiving fewer emails is sending fewer emails. Instead of banging out a reply and hitting send right away, email programs such as Microsoft Office and tools like Mixmax for Gmail allow us to delay a message\u2019s delivery. Whenever I reply to an email, I ask myself: \u201cWhen\u2019s the latest this person needs to see this reply?\u201d\n\nNever open an email more than twice\n\nChecking email isn\u2019t so much the problem; it\u2019s the habitual rechecking that gets us into trouble. Does this sound familiar? An icon tells you that you have an email, so you click and scroll through your inbox. While there, you read message after message to see if anything requires a reply. Later in the day, you open your inbox and, forgetting what was in the messages you read earlier, you open them again. If you\u2019re anything like I used to be, you might open and reopen some messages an embarrassing number of times. Instead, the first time we open an email, only do one thing before closing it \u2013 answer the question: \u201cWhen does this email require a response?\u201d Tagging each email with either \u201cToday\u201d or \u201cThis Week\u201d attaches the most important information to each message (those that don\u2019t need a response at all should be deleted or archived immediately). My daily schedule includes dedicated time for replying to emails I\u2019ve tagged \u201cToday\u201d. In addition, I reserve a three-hour timebox each week to plough through the less urgent messages I\u2019ve tagged \u201cThis Week\u201d.\n\nHack back feeds\n\nEliminate automated feeds\n\nJust because Big Tech uses sophisticated algorithms to keep us scrolling doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t hack back. A free web browser extension called News Feed Eradicator for Facebook does exactly what it says: it replaces alluring external triggers with an inspirational quote. Another free technology called Todobook, which works across several other social media sites including Reddit and Twitter, replaces the feed with the user\u2019s to-do list; only when it has been completed does the News Feed unlock.\n\nEmbrace bookmarking\n\nDuring my scheduled social media time, I click on a button in my browser to activate an extension called Open Multiple Websites. As the name suggests, the button opens all the website addresses I\u2019ve preloaded. Since I don\u2019t want to land on my LinkedIn.com feed, I\u2019ve preloaded LinkedIn.com/messaging, where I can read and respond to messages. With the same click, the browser extension opens Twitter.com/NirEyal, where I can respond to comments and questions without seeing the infamous and inflammatory Twitter feed.\n\nReduce YouTube distractions\n\nSimilar to a news feed, thumbnails of recommended videos appear as soon as you land on the homepage, sending you on a hunt for more digital treasure. The free browser extension DF Tube scrubs away distracting external triggers \u2013 both suggested videos and ads along the side of the screen. Regardless of the exact tool we choose, the key is to regain control over our experiences rather than allowing feeds to control us.\n\n\u2022 This is an edited extract from Indistractable: How To Control Your Attention And Choose Your Life by Nir Eyal, published by Bloomsbury at \u00a320.
