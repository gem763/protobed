I have to get them.' After that, it was a no-brainer. I just went out and got 'em.\"\n\nSince that moment, Harry took the world on as the frontwoman of Blondie, with her bandmate and partner Chris Stein, from the mid '70s into the '80s, becoming an icon of the punk scene.\n\nLester Cohen/Getty Images for ASCAP\n\nShe was even photographed by the legendary Andy Warhol at the height of her career as she sold tens of millions of LPs.\n\nBut fame was not always so easy for Harry.\n\nIn her memoir, she reveals she was sexually assaulted by someone who came into her home.\n\n\"I have a great partner in Chris. And he helped me just to sort of put it into proportion,\" Harry told \"GMA.\" \"Believe me, I felt anger, frustration. I wanted revenge. I went through every, you know, logical turn of emotion that you would normally go through when you're victimized. I think, for whatever reason, my sanity took over and said, 'You can't carry around this kind of anger and sense of frustration.'\"\n\nThe singer also struggled with being penniless after seven years of record sales and shows, and her partner, Stein, being hospitalized for a severe illness after they both used heroin.\n\n\"We were junkies,\" Harry said. \"And it was, you know, helped us survive this desperately horrible situation. The thing is, yes I regret it, 'cause I know that -- it was a silly waste of time.\"\n\nDespite all she's endured in her life, the \"Tide is High\" singer held on and was able to deal with everything that was thrown at her.\n\n\"I don't really regret my life,\" Harry said. \"The things that are important to me now are because I've you know, gone through all of this stuff.\"\n\nHarry also gave her high school self advice and said, \"'Carry on.' For some reason, I was able to deal with fear, extreme fear. And I have no answer for why I was able to do this. A stubborn streak? I don't know. But I was able to just leap over, you know, step over something and just -- 'cause I wanted to go there and not stop there.\"", "description": "Debbie Harry is chronicling her rock and roll life in a book titled", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/debbie-harry-01-as-gty-190929_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
