He was educated at prestigious Radley College in Oxfordshire, before studying for a master\u2019s in politics at Edinburgh.\n\nThe couple announced their engagement last month with a series of photos taken in the grounds of Windsor Great Park.\n\nIt has been reported that Beatrice is also considering holding the reception in a marquee at her parents\u2019 home, the Royal Lodge at Windsor.\n\nGraham Smith, of campaign group Republic, was sceptical about the news.\n\nHe said: \u201cI imagine that the public anger that came out because of the cost of Eugenie\u2019s wedding may have made them think twice.\n\n\u201cEven if this is a step in the right direction I am sure the wedding will end up costing the public something.\n\n\u201cThis should not be seen as a saving.\u201d", "description": "After backlash over sister Eugenie's \u00a32m police bill for her Windsor wedding and controversy surrounding dad Andrew, Beatrice wants more low-key nuptials", "authors": ["Tom Parry"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20572388.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS193937484.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
