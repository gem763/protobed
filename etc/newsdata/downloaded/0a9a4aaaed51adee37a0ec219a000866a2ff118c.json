Now as Virginia prepares for an Atlantic Coast Conference game at home against the Seminoles (1-1) on Saturday, coach Bronco Mendenhall echoed Perkins\u2018 comments, but said the quarterback\u2019s body of work mitigates any concern.\n\n\u201cI think he had the longest streak in the country of not throwing an interception, so if that\u2019s the case, I think you would view it is an aberration rather than something I\u2019m worried about,\u201d Mendenhall said.\n\nPerkins has thrown for four touchdowns and run for another to lead Virginia (2-0, 1-0 ACC). He also leads Virginia in rushing with 112 yards through two games. Keeping him healthy is critical to Virginia\u2019s success, but Mendenhall is not inclined to hold Perkins back.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of our design for him regardless of opponent,\u201d Mendenhall said of Perkins\u2018 running, \u201cand we think that it\u2019s essential that he does run, not only in designed runs, but creative and scramble runs, to have us be successful as a team. That\u2019s one of the things that makes him and us difficult to stop when that\u2019s going well. There are traditional runs and passes and traditional plays, and then there is just Bryce. I\u2019m for just Bryce plays.\u201d\n\nPerkins is not at 100 percent, having tweaked a knee in fall camp. He wears a brace in games as a precaution, and said he will continue to until he\u2019s fully healed, but he hardly looked hampered bolting off the left edge for a 7-yard TD run against the Tribe. It was his 10th rushing touchdown in 15 games as Virginia\u2019s quarterback.\n\n\u201cI want him to be confident, I want him to be assertive, and I want him to be fast thinking and aggressive,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cPart of that is through plays that maybe are off script. From the defensive side, that is really hard to handle. There is no design to stop that. If you do design for it, it takes away from something else.\u201d\n\nPerkins often provides a lift for the other members of the Virginia offense.\n\n\u201cJust having a dynamic quarterback as Bryce, especially his second year, he\u2019s just more comfortable. The rest of us are more comfortable around him. Just fitting into each other\u2019s style of play and being able to do a lot more, it\u2019s a lot of fun,\u201d fifth-year senior tight end Tanner Cowley, who is used primarily as a blocker, said.\n\nFlorida State has struggled defensively. The Seminoles escaped with a 45-44 overtime victory Saturday against Louisiana-Monroe after ULM missed the extra point after scoring a touchdown in overtime. The Warhawks ran for 178 yards, including 32 by quarterback Caleb Evans, but Seminoles coach Willie Taggart said the repairs are simple on defense.\n\n\u201cI think, again, what\u2019s going to help the issues is being fundamentally sound and doing our jobs and making sure that we have a really solid game plan and stop them,\u201d the Seminoles\u2019 second-year coach said.\n\nIn Perkins\u2018 mind, the Seminoles are still a member of college football\u2019s elite.\n\n\u201cOh man, a tremendous history of just great football players, great football program and definitely one of the teams, the handful of teams, that when you grew up you said, \u2018Wow. That team is great,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nThe game is set to kick off at 7:30 p.m.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Virginia quarterback Bryce Perkins knows he has to avoid \"stupid plays\" and stay within himself when the No. 25 Cavaliers take on Florida State this week.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Hank Kurz Jr."], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/william_mary_virginia_football_08411_c0-98-2835-1750_s1770x1032.jpg?61c1fd057cf3cdea8c18fcce63c93d9f9d87ae0b", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
