Events on Saturday gave us another insight into just how little trust there is in Westminster and how MPs are not going to make Johnson\u2019s life any easier just because he\u2019s got a deal.\n\nThe pressure is unlikely to ease up on MPs though just because the extension request was sent to Brussels. Until they confirm that it\u2019s been accepted, there is still a risk of no deal Brexit in 10 days time. The EU could wait until late in the day before accepting an extension in an attempt to pressure MPs to back Johnson\u2019s deal.\n\nThis week is therefore likely to be another chaotic one in Westminster, as Boris tries to get Parliament to back his deal and MPs try to change it and attach conditions, like a second referendum. That will make for another volatile week for the currency as the drama unfolds and we learn whether we\u2019re actually leaving this time or not.\n\nconsolidates but remains vulnerable\n\nGold prices are stable on Monday, trading within the same ranges that it did throughout the last week. While the yellow metal continues to look a little bearish in the near-term, it is dragging its feet which may be giving bulls some hope. The lack of clarity around the phase one trade agreement probably isn\u2019t helping matters while ongoing Brexit uncertainty just adds to this. The key levels remain unchanged with $1,480 and $1,460 below still looking vulnerable.\n\nGold Daily Chart\n\nGold Daily Chart\n\nprices linger around their lows\n\nOil prices have also been consolidating around their lows this month, unable to break below long-term support but lacking the catalyst for a corrective move higher. The $55-57 area is still key for , with a break through here possibly providing the momentum for another hefty move to the downside.\n\nDaily Chart\n\nBrent Daily Chart\n\nEconomic Calendar\n\nEconomic Calendar\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Stocks Analysis by MarketPulse (Craig Erlam) covering: GBP/USD, XAU/USD, Gold Futures, Brent Oil Futures.
