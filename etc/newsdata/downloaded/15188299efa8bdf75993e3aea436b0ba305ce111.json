Shares slipped 0.7 per cent, or 1p, to 1489p.\n\nStock Watch - Haydale Graphene Industries Haydale Graphene Industries has unveiled a range of materials that offer protection against lightning strikes. These could be applied to drones, planes, space technology and offshore wind turbines, which Haydale says are particularly susceptible to being struck. It has developed the materials with companies including Airbus UK, GE Aviation and BAE Systems, and has been testing them with customers. AIM-listed Haydale surged 1.9 per cent, or 0.03p, to 1.35p.\n\nAnd another construction industry supplier, brick and concrete products-maker Forterra, tumbled 8.7 per cent, or 26p, to 273p, as it said full-year profit before tax is likely to be 'modestly below' the \u00a364.8million it made last year.\n\nAlthough new housing has been steady, Forterra said it was suffering from a slowdown in non-residential building and getting fewer orders from distributors.\n\nIts hit from delays to large contracts and a general drop in demand for materials echoes the recent warnings issued by SIG (up 0.9 per cent, or 1.1p, to 119.7p) and Grafton Group (down 2.5 per cent, or 20.5p, to 816p).\n\nElsewhere, the UK's biggest car dealer, Pendragon, accelerated back into the black with pre-tax profit of \u00a33million in the three months to September, following cost-cutting that included shutting underperforming showrooms.\n\nThere was a 3.6 per cent fall in revenues at sites open for more than a year, including a double-digit drop in used car sales, and it confirmed it will make a loss for the full-year. Despite the bleak outlook, shares rose 2.6 per cent, or 0.3p, to 11.9p.\n\nMore Brexit anxiety kept the London Stock Exchange's two major indexes on pause.\n\nThe exporter-heavy FTSE 100 lifted 0.7 per cent, or 48.85 points, to 7212.49, while the domestically focused FTSE 250 slid 0.6 per cent, or 126.88 points, to 20,181.91.\n\nHoliday group Tui hit the bottom of the Footsie after brokers at Morgan Stanley cut its rating from 'overweight' to 'equal weight', worried that the crisis with Boeing's 737 Max aircraft will drag out even longer and rack up more costs for the Anglo-German company. Shares shed 7.1 per cent, or 75.7p, to 990.8p.\n\nMiner Anglo American \u2013 up 1 per cent, or 20.2p, to 1960p \u2013 said third-quarter production nudged up 4 per cent but was held back by an 8 per cent fall in copper production following drought in Chile and a 14 per cent fall in production at its De Beers diamond mining arm.\n\nA cross-border payments collaboration between Finablr and Airtel Africa failed to muster much enthusiasm from the City.\n\nThe partnership will mean Airtel customers can send money from more than 100 countries to mobile wallets across Africa.\n\nAirtel was down 1.4 per cent, or 0.8p, to 56.7p, while Finablr shed 1.2 per cent, or 2p, to 159p.", "description": "Chief executive Alison Brittain blamed Brexit uncertainty for the tumble in business travel and said she wasn't sure if striking a divorce deal would lead to a recovery in business confidence.", "authors": ["Francesca Washtell For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
