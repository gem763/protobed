Offred\u2019s story, the one we\u2019ve just received in such potent detail, was discovered on some cassette tapes found buried in a house on the \u201cUnderground Femaleroad\u201d in what was once Bangor, Maine. Who exactly was Offred? What happened to her next? The scholars have no idea, and all the reader knows is that she has been taken away, either to freedom or her own execution. She is merely another victim of Gilead \u2014 a faceless voice with yet another tale of woe and oppression. Offred was the heroine of her own story and her own story alone. Like most of us.\n\nShe is far more than that in the TV adaptation of the genre-spanning 1985 classic. Hulu\u2019s heroine, Offred counterpart June Osborne, morphed from trapped spider to radioactively bitten superhero over three progressively overripe seasons, giving Trump-traumatized fans the Marvelized feminist hero they were looking for, rather than the sacrificial victim of the novel. Despite Elisabeth Moss\u2019s genius commitment to June\u2019s every eye twitch and head cock, the character has remained alive through the sheer desperation of the show\u2019s writers. Now, 34 years after the publication of Handmaid\u2019s Tale, comes Atwood\u2019s book sequel, The Testaments, accomplishing at least one great thing: moving Offred offstage. Praise effing be \u2014 to a point.\n\nFor me, the sense of relief on encountering an Offred-free sequel was personal. I\u2019ve spent years devoting the fair share of my weekly brain power to writing about the television show, never knowing until I dug into The Testaments this week how much I\u2019d missed the source material: those classic Atwoodian zings (\u201cPenises,\u201d one character thinks, \u201cThem again.\u201d), and the precise, ingenious details of Gileadean ritual, like the elaborate array of gown colors worn by young girls along a puberty-through-marriage spectrum. In the early going, I sensed that Atwood was well on her way to broadening and deepening the world that readers so love to fear.\n\nAlas, just around the midway point, The Testaments triples down on the fan service, supplanting Hulu\u2019s singular heroine with three. Where The Handmaid\u2019s Tale shrugged off into darkness, its fearsome ambiguity leaving readers anxious about their own fates, The Testaments offers women a firm, reenergizing slap on the back, unapologetically spinning out into a redemptive crusade. If Atwood wrote The Handmaid\u2019s Tale to let us know how bad things could get, she wrote The Testaments to remind us that we shall overcome, as some of her desperate characters sing when first imprisoned. This novel is essentially a brilliantly written inspirational slogan T-shirt. Perhaps that will stir our weary feminist hearts, but it also turns the story of Gilead\u2019s unraveling into a less plausible parable, a parade of greatness, a one-note hymn of empowerment. This is all great fun for the tentpole crowd, but what good is a dystopian novel that simply assures us we\u2019re all going to be okay?\n\nMargaret Atwood.

There\u2019s Daisy, a teenage girl in Toronto whom we can easily guess is actually Baby Nicole, Offred\u2019s smuggled-out offspring \u2014 though her identity is hidden even from herself. Her Gileadean counterpart is Agnes, raised in fairy-tale captivity (wicked stepmother and all) as the daughter of a commander. Both their stories \u2014 covering well over a decade in the yin and yang of their unexpectedly conjoined lives \u2014 are presented only as \u201ctranscripts\u201d of \u201cwitness testimony,\u201d just like Offred\u2019s cassette tapes. But unlike Offred\u2019s, these girls\u2019 stories have the potential to loom large in the world, to earn them heroic status.\n\nThe third voice belongs to Aunt Lydia, that imperious, Taser-wielding Bible-camp counselor from hell whose backstory isn\u2019t so much sketched in here as vividly painted in shades of blood red and drab brown. Hers is a written account of the Thomas Cromwell\u2013like role she\u2019s assumed as a Founder of the Aunts and architect of the Handmaids\u2019 tightly regimented lives. It\u2019s addressed to \u201cmy reader\u201d \u2014 a subtle nod to Jane Eyre, one of Aunt Lydia\u2019s favorite novels (ironically enough) \u2014 and has been secreted away in the Aunts\u2019 private Hildegard Library, hilariously hidden in a copy of Cardinal Newman\u2019s Apologia Pro Vita Sua. (Atwood\u2019s dexterity with names and clever play with religious idiolect are a small Handmaid\u2019s Tale pleasure that survives into the sequel.) \u201cWho are you, my reader?\u201d Aunt Lydia asks, \u201cAnd when are you? Perhaps tomorrow, perhaps 50 years from now, perhaps never.\u201d Like Offred, Agnes, and Nicole, she\u2019s hoping her story will be heard \u2014 just not too soon, or by the wrong people.\n\nIf recent trends in literature have taught us anything, it\u2019s that we\u2019ll eventually be blinded by flashes of sympathy for the female devil. No woman in TV or literature can lately commit a crime without a roster of evidence detailing the emotional damage that led her astray. Aunt Lydia\u2019s own apologia describes her slide into moral decrepitude, from family-court judge to a woman with a Gileadean statue erected in her honor. Unlike Nicole and Agnes, young cogs in their respective machines, Lydia is the real (cold, cruel) heart at the center of this novel, and her rise (or fall, depending on your ethical compass) makes for the most delicious reading. What a wretch Aunt Lydia is at the start, goading her readers. \u201cThink how much worse [Gilead] could have been if not for me.\u201d Her nasty tongue and duplicitous nature intrigue as she bobs and weaves around the inner workings of Gilead\u2019s elite, keeping her true intentions secret and her readers in suspense. Until, that is, the novel becomes stuffed so full of sympathetic backstory that this most repugnant figure of a dazzlingly repugnant bunch simply comes apart at the seams. She stops being Aunt Lydia and turns into a Complicated Woman.\n\nLord, how I wanted to adore this novel, to slide into its now-familiar world and poke around with a new cast of women, to see how Atwood would stand up against the instinct to give us what we want, rather than what we need. But in the end, I regret to inform you that she succumbed to our own cultural dystopia, our brave new world in which no wish is left unfulfilled, where all feminist-horror stories give way to animated Rosie the Riveter posters.\n\nWe don\u2019t, of course, need another version of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale; that book ought to remain hermetically sealed as the exemplar of the genre, a sui generis giant among its lightly recalibrated imitators. (Consider the absolute deluge of dystopian feminist books in just the past couple of years: Red Clocks by Leni Zumas, The Farm by Joanna Ramos, The Water Cure by Sophie Macintosh, The Power by Naomi Alderman, and Vox by Christina Dalcher.) And it certainly doesn\u2019t kill us to inject a little uplift into the grim daily reality of watching American democracy skid around like a cat on skates over rapidly thinning ice. But where Gilead initially succeeded was in terrifying us into a new understanding of how the world might fuck us all over and then play tiddlywinks with our anatomy. The allure wasn\u2019t in discovering how such a world would end; it was in watching, with a little too much understanding, how it was born. \u201cHow tedious is a tyranny in the throes of enactment. It\u2019s always the same plot,\u201d Aunt Lydia says \u2014 and for once she is wrong, because it\u2019s the enactment that baits us.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s the fatal flaw in The Testaments \u2014 that it is, so strictly, a sequel; that it huddles around the women closest to Offred while neglecting her legacy; that it cannot do what Handmaid\u2019s did lest it wind up a whiter shade of pale. And so it heads in the opposite direction, toward universal greatness and heroism. There are plenty of villains, to be sure \u2014 a particularly lecherous dentist, the aforementioned wicked stepmother, a Commander with a suspicious number of dead wives. But as we the readers stagger toward our own potential permutations of Gilead, novels of black-and-white don\u2019t serve us nearly as well as those in shades of gray. If we must, as Atwood has instructed us, read The Testaments in response to our own times, why not dispel the myth that the oppressed lack only the right information and a little bit of pluck?\n\nWhere we might have had a gentle corrective to what Hulu hath wrought \u2014 a novel in the spirit of its predecessor \u2014 there is instead another swerve toward shock and gasps. Reading The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, we cried out in pain for the women of Gilead. With The Testaments, we\u2019re crying out in frustration.", "description": "Margaret Atwood has published The Testaments, her sequel to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, after the Hulu series has run for several seasons.
