They teamed up with Road Safety Support's technical manager Steve Callaghan who worked out Achilles speed.\n\nThey found Achilles, of Denham, Uxbridge, was driving at 11 speeds - with 58mph being his lowest and a maxmimum of 93mph in an accident hot-spot. None of them were within the 50mph speed limit.\n\nHe was found guilty of speeding at the Southern Derbyshire Magistrates\u2019 Court and given a \u00a3615 fine.\n\nJoe Achilles, 40, recorded his high-speed journey (pictured) and treated the roads 'as a race track'\n\nThe YouTuber's driving was 'careless, reckless and selfish', Sergeant Adam Shipley said, as 'too often' the outcome of speeding can be different\n\nAchilles, who describes himself as a 'non click bait' motoring YouTuber, will get six points on his license and be ordered to pay costs of \u00a3620.\n\nThe YouTuber's driving was 'careless, reckless and selfish', Sergeant Adam Shipley said, as 'too often' the outcome of speeding can be different.\n\nHe told the court: 'For a man who drives for a profession I am appalled that he seemingly has so little value for the lives of other road users.\n\nJoe Achilles was found driving at 11 speeds along the Snake Pass (pictured file image) in Derbyshire on November 3, after he uploaded the clip of his driving to Facebook. He was fined \u00a3620 and has been given six points on his license at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates\u2019 Court\n\n'Strapping a Go Pro to the side of a car and driving in this manner \u2013 all in a bid to get viewers on social media \u2013 is quite frankly pathetic.'\n\nMr Shipley hopes the case will provide a message to people who think 'they can come into our country and put lives at risk'.\n\n'We may not see you at the time but know that we have the capability to ensure that you are brought to justice.'\n\nMr Callaghan was able to identify the road heading eastwards towards Sheffield by the road markings in the clip uploaded to Facebook. He used Google Earth Pro to measure the distances between the signs.\n\nHe said: 'With the distances and times established it was possible to calculate a series of average speeds between the landmarks.'\n\nAchilles has a 57.4k following and claims to have 'chaperoned some of the world\u2019s top models and celebrities, ensuring they get to and from jobs, events and private appointments quickly, on time and in a calm and comfortable manner'.\n\nIf you come across a video which you believe shows dangerous driving in Derbyshire, you can contact the Derbyshire Capture website here.", "description": "Joe Achilles, 40, recorded himself driving at nearly 100mph along the A57 Snake Pass in the Derbyshire area, before uploading it to Facebook.
