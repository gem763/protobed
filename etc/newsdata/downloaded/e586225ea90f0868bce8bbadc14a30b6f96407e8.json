Besides, there are many reasons the horse would have bitten the hand that leads him:\n\nPence saw him and another stallion grooming each other, and American Pharoah worried he\u2019d be sent to the glue factory.\n\nPence told the stud that sex is only between one stallion and one mare, whom the stallion should call \u201cmother.\u201d\n\nPence advised American Pharoah not to eat oats with a mare unless others are present at the same trough.\n\nMore likely, it was something in American Pharoah\u2019s horse sense that told him the man in the suit was a weak specimen.\n\nHorse herds are hierarchical, and nobody bites the dominant horse, or alpha, because the perpetrator would be badly hurt or ostracized from the herd. As the \u201cexpert animal communicator\u201d Val Heart writes: \u201cBiting you may mean that your stallion/horse doesn\u2019t consider you to be their alpha leader, and that their status is higher than yours. . . . And you haven\u2019t earned their respect.\u201d\n\nIt is almost as if American Pharoah had seen how Pence is treated around the White House.\n\nMaybe the stable hands play CNN, or maybe American Pharoah\u2019s equine instincts sense subservience. But this stallion somehow knew Pence was a sycophant. This is the guy who, after all, just flew 200 miles out of the way to stay at Trump\u2019s property in Doonbeg, Ireland \u2014 at Trump\u2019s, ahem, \u201csuggestion\u201d \u2014 dutifully promoting the resort in public appearances.\n\nDays after that, he dismissed \u201cFake News\u201d reports that he objected to Trump\u2019s outrageous decision to invite the Taliban to Camp David days before the 9/11 anniversary. \u201cI FULLY support your decision,\u201d Pence tweeted to Trump, putting submissiveness above dignity.\n\nPence has likewise set aside principles to defend Trump\u2019s public vulgarities and blasphemy, the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, the Stormy Daniels payoff, his comments on racial violence in Charlottesville , his personal profiting from government funds, his chumminess with tyrants worldwide and his praise for WikiLeaks. Pence has gushed repeatedly about his boss\u2019s \u201cbroad shoulders,\u201d gazed adoringly at him in public, defended Trump\u2019s falsehoods and showered him with praise about his miraculous and best-ever presidency. He even apes his boss\u2019s gestures, down to where to place a water bottle. Why? Maybe Pence explained it best himself the day he was supposedly bitten by American Pharoah: \u201cI like to be around winners.\u201d\n\nIn exchange? Trump publicly contradicts Pence and declines to extinguish fully the possibility he\u2019ll dump Pence from the ticket.\n\nTrump might not have American Pharoah\u2019s speed, but their behaviors are similar. The comedian John Mulaney likens Trump\u2019s presidency to a horse loose in a hospital: \u201cNo one knows what the horse is going to do next, least of all the horse. . . . So all day long you walk around, \u2018What\u2019d the horse do? What\u2019d the horse do?\u2019 The updates, they\u2019re not always bad; sometimes they\u2019re just odd. It\u2019ll be like, \u2018The horse used the elevator? I didn\u2019t know he knew how to do that.\u2019 The creepiest days are when you don\u2019t hear from the horse . . . those quiet days when people are like, \u2018It looks like the horse has finally calmed down.\u2019 And then 10 seconds later the horse is like, \u2018I\u2019m gonna run toward the baby incubators and smash \u2019em with my hooves.\u2019\u201d\n\nPence could do something about the untamed equine now running the country. The answer is in the literature of animal husbandry.\n\n\u201cHorses bite because they are afraid. Bullies behave badly because they have poor self esteem and are fearful,\u201d equine expert Lynn Baber writes. \u201cHorses behave poorly for similar reasons. . . . Your horse didn\u2019t bite you because he has excessive self-esteem.\u201d\n\nHow to calm the rampaging horse? \u201cHorses, like people, give respect where it is due,\u201d Baber explains. \u201cHorses, like most animals and people, are naturally attracted to calm, confident personalities. One must be worthy to be a good herd leader.\u201d\n\nMaybe that\u2019s what American Pharoah was trying to tell Pence with his bite: Don\u2019t let that orange-maned beast trample you.\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "The horse has plenty of reasons to bite Mike Pence.", "authors": ["Dana Milbank", "Op-Ed Columnist Covering National Politics", "September At Pm", "Dana Milbank Is An Op-Ed Columnist.
