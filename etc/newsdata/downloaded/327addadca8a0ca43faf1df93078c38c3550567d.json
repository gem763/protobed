She added that the rumoured threat stripped away students\u2019 right to free speech.\n\n\u201cAlthough I\u2019m not sure how effective this human chain will be to let our voices be heard, I believe doing something is still better than doing nothing. Also, if the authorities did nothing wrong, why should they fear and suppress our voices?\u201d\n\nA 16-year-old concern group member from Ying Wa College who distributed stickers during the human chain, said he hoped more students would join them to show their support for the pro-democracy protesters.\n\nSix records were broken just in the morning session of this year's inter-school competition\n\nSwimmers from schools such as Ying Wa College, Diocesan Girls\u2019 School and Diocesan Boys\u2019 School were seen competing with the stickers on their bodies.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t speak up now, the consequences that we have to bear in the future will be much more damaging,\u201d said the concern group member.\n\nLast Thursday, ahead of the heats, extradition bill concern groups from different schools began calling on their schoolmates on Instagram to join the human chain.\n\nThey also made a joint statement, referring to the new arrangements this year in which the HKSSF banned photographers and journalists from entering the poolside area to conduct interviews, which was a new approach this year.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to notice that the federation changed the regulations just to silence those who want to voice their [political opinions] at the competition and hinder the press to document such scenarios.\u201d", "description": "On a day filled with spectacular performances in the pool, a student in a Guy Fawkes mask led spectators in a rendition of the song that's become an anthem.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/image_from_ios_7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
