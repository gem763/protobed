She claims she first began seeing symptoms months ago after she was cut on her right thumb while getting a manicure at Jazzy Nail Bar in Knoxville.\n\nORLANDO MAN WHO LOST 25 PERCENT OF SKIN TO FLESH-EATING BACTERIA HAS DIED\n\n\"While I was there I got stuck on my thumb and I went 'ouch' but I went back to looking at my telephone,\" she told the station. Her thumb began to throb and she fell so ill that she had trouble sleeping that night, she said.\n\nSharp went to Summit Medical Group the next day to be checked for the flu. When the flu test came back negative, nurse practitioner Nikki Brown drew a line around a spot on Sharp\u2019s thumb that showed an unusual amount of swelling. Brown told her to monitor the spot in case the swelling got worse. Brown ordered Sharp to go to the emergency room the next day after being told over the phone that the swelling had spread up her right arm. Sharp also developed a red rash.\n\n\"She could have lost her finger or her arm if she hadn't been diagnosed properly,\" Dr. Udit Chaudhuri, an internal medicine specialist with Summit Medical Group who also treated Sharp, told WBIR.\n\nHe explained that flesh-eating disease, known medically as necrotizing fasciitis, can be contracted through an open cut or wound and \u201cthis bacteria gets introduced under the skin into the soft tissue and then into the blood stream.\" He added that individuals with compromised immune systems are more likely to contract the disease.
