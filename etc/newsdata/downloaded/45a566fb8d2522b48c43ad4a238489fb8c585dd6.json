The best (and worst) quotes, adoption and regulation highlights, leading coins, predictions and much more \u2014 a week on Cointelegraph in one link.\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nIt\u2019s official: PayPal has left the Libra Association \u2014 the governing body of Facebook\u2019s embattled digital currency. Although the payment processing giant says it remains supportive of the stablecoin\u2019s aspirations, the company was absent from a meeting of 28 Libra backers on Thursday. Others may follow suit. On Wednesday, reports suggested Mastercard and Visa were also unsure about whether they wished to become paid-up participants. Some companies believe Facebook exaggerated claims that regulators were comfortable with Libra \u2014 something that evidently isn\u2019t the case given the recent backlash. They also fear that regulatory scrutiny could end up bleeding into their own businesses. In other developments this week, leaked audio of Q&A sessions hosted by Mark Zuckerberg in July revealed the CEO wanted to take a consultative approach to get the project off the ground. Meanwhile, American banks on the Federal Advisory Council warned Libra has the potential to create a \u201cshadow banking\u201d system \u2014 substantially reducing bank payment volumes.\n\nCrypto investors who were hoping to see signs of recovery in prices have been left bitterly disappointed this week. Bitcoin (BTC) has encountered some volatility, but ultimately has struggled to break away from $8,000 \u2014 a price point established during last week\u2019s crash. A fake breakout saw BTC jump from a seven-day low of $7,746 to highs of $8,480 between Sept. 29 and Oct. 1, but the gains were not to last, with the world\u2019s dominant cryptocurrency retracing back to its earlier price level. Analysts say BTC needs to break upward before altcoins can start outperforming it. Also this week, a markets overview from Binance Research singled out the launch of institutional trading platform Bakkt as a contributing factor in Bitcoin\u2019s price slip.\n\nEstablished American crypto firms, Coinbase and Kraken among them, have teamed up to launch a rating system that defines which digital assets are securities. The so-called Crypto Ratings Council is designed to provide more clarity on which tokens can be traded without the supervision of regulators. Digital assets are scored on a scale of 1 to 5 \u2014 with the highest score indicating that a certain token is considered as a security that cannot be issued, sold or traded by unregulated firms. Executives are hoping that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will view this as a positive step, but critics have claimed the council\u2019s assessments could be compromised by conflicts of interest. In other news, the crypto exchange OKEx has announced it is creating a self-regulated organization with a view to standardizing crypto exchange compliance practices and policies.\n\nTim Cook has poured cold water on the idea that Apple intends to create its own digital currency. Speaking to a French media, the Apple CEO said: \u201cI truly think currency should remain in the hands of the state. I\u2019m not comfortable with the idea that a private entity can create a modern currency.\u201d His remarks could be regarded as taking a direct swipe at Facebook\u2019s Libra \u2014 and also have the potential to rile crypto proponents. Cook\u2019s stance also flies in the face of his own executives. Last month, Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay, said the company is monitoring developments in the crypto industry closely because it has \u201cinteresting long-term potential.\u201d\n\nBillionaire technology investor Mark Cuban made his stance on crypto painfully clear this week \u2014 telling a video Q&A session he would be happier owning bananas than Bitcoin. A Twitter user had asked Cuban why he was so against crypto given his interest in \u201cproviding opportunity for people to grow their net worth.\u201d The entrepreneur replied by arguing that BTC has no intrinsic value \u2014 just like artwork, comic books and baseball cards. Cuban then insisted that BTC is too complicated for the average person, and drew parallels between crypto and gold, adding: \u201cYou carry around a gold bar \u2014 someone\u2019s gonna hit your ass, knock you out and steal your gold bar and it\u2019s gonna happen again and again and again. I\u2019d rather have bananas, I can eat bananas. Crypto\u2026 Not so much.\u201d\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $8,005.60, Ether at $173.77 and XRP at $0.25. The total market cap is at $214,891,569,511.\n\nThe top three altcoin gainers of the week are Humanscape, Bitcoin X and Bitcoin God. The top three altcoin losers of the week are Tellurion, Jesus Coin and BigUp.\n\nFor more info on crypto prices, make sure to read Cointelegraph\u2019s market analysis.\n\nMost Memorable Quotations\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing about crypto, particularly Bitcoin: Bitcoin is worth what somebody will pay for it. [...] I\u2019d rather have bananas, I can eat bananas. Crypto\u2026 not so much.\u201d Mark Cuban, billionaire tech investor\n\n\u201cIt [digital currency] is inevitable. [...] I think it is better for us to start getting our hands around it.\u201d Patrick Harker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\n\u201cI am much more nervous about projects which develop in a dark corner in the financial system somewhere, spread themselves out through cyberspace and one day are too big to be stopped.\u201d Mark Branson, FINMA head\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that the primacy of the U.S. Dollar could be in long-term jeopardy from wide adoption of digital fiat currencies. [...] Is the Federal Reserve exploring the development, or actively developing, a U.S. dollar digital currency?\u201d French Hill and Bill Foster, U.S. representatives\n\n\u201cFacebook is potentially creating a digital monetary ecosystem outside of sanctioned financial markets \u2014 or a \u2018shadow banking\u2019 system.\u201d Federal Advisory Council\n\n\u201cBakkt\u2019s disappointing start seems to have been a contributing factor to the recent price decline.\u201d Binance Research\n\n\u201cThe http://FairWin.me Ponzi Scheme contains critical vulnerabilities that put all funds at risk. Spread knowledge (especially in Asia) Users need to withdraw their funds and stop interacting with the contract ASAP.\u201d Philippe Castonguay, blockchain developer\n\nPrediction of the Week\n\nMunich-based BayernLB has predicted that BTC will enjoy a big leap in 2020 \u2014 suggesting that the forthcoming halving event for the major cryptocurrency has yet to be factored into its current price. Senior analysts at the bank said gold has had to earn its high stock-to-flow ratio \u201cthe hard way over the course of millennia,\u201d but BTC is set to achieve a similar ratio within a matter of months. Stock-to-flow ratios are calculated by taking the amount of assets that is held in reserves and dividing it by the amount of an asset produced annually. Don\u2019t expect BayernLB\u2019s prediction to receive universal praise \u2014 gold bugs such as Peter Schiff are adamant that the risk of a rapid descent down to $4,000 or lower remains high.\n\nFUD of the Week\n\nCoinexchange.io is shutting down because of financial difficulties, with the altcoin platform insisting that the closure is purely a business decision that isn\u2019t connected to a security breach. The exchange, which supports more than 500 altcoins and has a daily trading volume of about $700,000, said the cost of providing high levels of security and customer support meant \u201cit is no longer economically viable for us to continue offering market services.\u201d Trading and deposits will cease within two weeks, and users are being urged to halt any activity as soon as they can. Customers are being asked to remove all remaining funds from the platform by Dec. 1.\n\nThe beginning of the week saw the Bitcoin network experience fresh turbulence \u2014 and on Tuesday, video appeared to show why. A fire has destroyed mining rings worth $10 million, with a giant data center owned by Innosilicon going up in flames. Footage appeared to show the machines continuing to run despite the fire. This coincided with a drop in Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate \u2014 dropping from 86 quintillion hashes per second to 82. Social media users have connected the dots, but others have stressed that hash rates only provide a limited view of BTC\u2019s overall health.\n\nUnited Kingdom-based crypto wallet provider Blockchain.com has seen two of its longest-serving executives head for the exit. COO Diana Douillet Guzm\u00e1n and Chris Lavery, executive vice president of finance, are both expected to leave. This is the continuation of an apparent exodus that has seen several bosses leave the company within just 12 months of being hired. It is believed that Blockchain.com\u2019s board has investigated why so many departures are occurring \u2014 coming to the conclusion that many of the new hires were a poor fit for the crypto startup\u2019s culture because they hailed from the traditional financial sector. Changes to the firm\u2019s hiring process have been recommended, which include drawing on a wider pool of talent.\n\nBest Cointelegraph Features\n\nCrypto companies often find out the hard way that hackers know their security systems better than they do. Bug bounties have become popular in countering this, with hackers given rewards whenever they find vulnerabilities. Here, Henry Linver explores these schemes in further detail \u2014 and it seems the concept is not without its critics.\n\nOffline transactions could create additional security layers and theoretically enable complete censorship resistance for cryptocurrencies. Osato Avan-Nomayo explores whether this could also be the silver bullet for achieving high levels of adoption worldwide.\n\nEOS users have been experiencing periodic problems with network access, but developers insist everything is \u201coperating correctly.\u201d With new research claiming that the entire network can be frozen with just $6 worth of tokens, Stephen O\u2019Neal delves into the problem, and what \u2014 if anything \u2014 Block.one is doing about it.", "description": "PayPal pulls out of the Libra Association, crypto markets fail to recover, and Mark Cuban says he\u2019d rather have bananas than BTC", "authors": ["Thomas Simms"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8yNWU0NDAwOTg1ZTk3OTQ3NjMxNjRkOWZiOWVjNjdiMy5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
