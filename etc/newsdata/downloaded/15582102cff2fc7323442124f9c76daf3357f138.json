The only form of Brexit that we have, whenever that might be, will be a Brexit that the House of Commons has explicitly endorsed.\u201d\n\nBercow insists Johnson must obey law and ask for Brexit extension \u2013 live Read more\n\nHe also proposed a written constitution to stop \u201cexecutive malpractice or fiat\u201d, which could potentially have avoided the constitutional crisis that the UK has found itself in over Brexit.\n\nBercow\u2019s dramatic intervention will be one of his last as Speaker, as he has announced that he will stand down at the end of October just two weeks after parliament is due to return from its current state of suspension.\n\nJohnson faced yet another difficult day on Thursday as he was forced to deny having misled the Queen over his reasons for proroguing parliament, which was judged unlawful this week by a Scottish court. The full ruling of three appeal court judges was published on Thursday, in which they agreed unanimously it was to prevent proper parliamentary scrutiny of his Brexit strategy, and for no other reason.\n\nPlay Video 1:15 Boris Johnson says claims that he lied to the Queen are 'absolutely not' true - video\n\nLord Carloway, the Lord President, said prorogation was sought \u201cin a clandestine manner\u201d during a time when Downing Street knew that 75 MPs and peers were taking the government to court to block prorogation.\n\nSpeaking after an event about shipbuilding, Johnson said it was \u201cabsolutely not true\u201d that he lied to the monarch in advising her to suspend parliament, insisting it was a decision taken to facilitate a Queen\u2019s speech in mid-October. The prime minister, who is due to give a speech in the north of England on Friday, highlighted a differing judgment by the high court in London and said it was for the supreme court to make a final adjudication next week.\n\nJohnson also sought to play down a row about the role of Scottish judges in ruling prorogation unlawful after the business minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, claimed \u201cmany people\u201d thought judges were biased in relation to Brexit.\n\nWith his options narrowing, Johnson appears to be increasing efforts to secure a deal with the EU, possibly by moving more towards a watered-down form of Northern Ireland-only backstop. However, he maintains that a no-deal Brexit on 31 October is still possible and sought to minimise the significance of the Operation Yellowhammer documents published by order of parliament on Wednesday. These set out the threat of food and medicine shortages, travel disruption and public disorder in a worst-case no-deal scenario.\n\nThe prime minister has pledged to abide by the law in general but he has also said he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than ask the EU for another Brexit extension and suggested in a letter to Tory members that he is only bound by the legislation forbidding a no-deal exit on 31 October \u201cin theory\u201d. His top adviser, Dominic Cummings, is said to believe that the law does not make the government bound to secure a delay from the EU, but various options \u2013 such as sending a contradictory letter to Brussels \u2013 have been dismissed as illegal by experts. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, has suggested Johnson could be a \u201cBrexit martyr\u201d if he holds out against requesting an extension.\n\nIn his speech Bercow lambasted the idea that Johnson could even consider ignoring legislation passed by MPs, which mandates the prime minister to seek a three-month Brexit delay if no deal is struck by mid-October.\n\nHe went on to compare any attempt by Brexit advocates to ignore the law in pursuit of what they believe to be a higher cause to \u201crobbing a bank on the basis that the cash stolen would be donated to a charitable cause immediately afterwards\u201d.\n\nScottish court ruling: what happens next in prorogation dispute? Read more\n\n\u201cNot obeying the law must surely be a non-starter. Period. Surely. In 2019, in modern Britain, in a parliamentary democracy, we parliamentarians, legislators, cannot in all conscience be conducting a debate as to whether adherence to the law is or is not required,\u201d Bercow said.\n\n\u201cWhat conceivable moral force do the public\u2019s representatives have in seeking to tackle antisocial behaviour, in seeking to prosecute the fight against knife crime and seeking to argue the state should protect itself against all sorts of nefarious illegality if we are to treat for a moment the proposition it might be in order in the name of some higher cause to disregard \u2026 It is astonishing that anyone has even tried to entertain the notion. It would be the most terrible example to set to the rest of society.\u201d\n\nBercow, who is standing down after 10 years in the Speaker\u2019s chair, said the \u201cBrexit maelstrom\u201d had exposed weaknesses in the country\u2019s political framework.\n\n\u201cI have been a sceptic in the past about the desirability of a written constitution for the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cI have come to the conclusion that it\u2019s worth establishing a royal commission or a Speaker\u2019s conference to explore [the options].\u201d\n\nIt should aim to ensure, he said, that the authority of the House of Commons is \u201cnever distorted by executive malpractices or fiat ... We must consider whether a written constitution is what we need.\u201d\n\nThree outcomes, Bercow explained, were most likely when parliament returns on 14 October: a new withdrawal agreement supported by parliament, a no-deal Brexit backed by a Commons majority, or a request by the government to Brussels for a future temporary extension of the UK\u2019s membership of the EU.\n\nBercow has become a vilified figure among Brexiters who believe he has been complicit in thwarting efforts to leave the EU.\n\nAddressing his critics, Bercow said he believed he had never bent or broken the rules of the House of Commons.\n\nHe condemned those \u201cbigots\u201d who conduct personal attacks on MPs. Portraying MPs such as Dominic Grieve in newspapers as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d is a dangerous development, he said. And using such terms as \u201cGo back\u201d is noxious and repellent, he added.", "description": "Commons Speaker issues direct challenge to ministers threatening to ignore legislation", "authors": ["Rowena Mason", "Owen Bowcott"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ed508e44fe8dcb386faa1f33bc289fbfb52a761/0_162_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bb55456109cf83462b1bcfad907f36f1"}
