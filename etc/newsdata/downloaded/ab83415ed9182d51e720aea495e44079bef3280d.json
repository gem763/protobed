Churches really need to not step into the political arena. \"We are told that one should avoid discussing two things at the dinner table: religion and politics. Clearly they have never eaten at our dinner tables. Religion and politics can be polarizing, precisely because they deal with important matters that are deeply personal and close to our passions. But these discussions do not have to be polarizing or combative. Intolerance of another person\u2019s faith is a personal choice, not a legal requirement. We are also told that we \u201cshould not mix religion and politics.\u201d Again, this saying has a powerful truth: that when religion is used for political purposes, it empties religion of its eternal meaning and becomes just one more cynical method of acquiring power. But there is also a disclaimer hidden in that phrase: that sometimes when people say \u201cDon\u2019t mix religion and politics,\u201d they actually mean \u201cDon\u2019t bring your faith into the public square where I can see it.\u201d In other words, hide your faith outside of your place of worship because we have a \u201cseparation of church and state.\u201d Separation of church and state is too important a concept to be misused \u2014 especially not as a tool for silencing opposing views. As a matter of fact, on National Religious Freedom Day, it just might be as important as ever to consider the true meaning of church/state separation and religious freedom.\" https://time.com/5103677/church-state-separation-religious-freedom/", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XGyyTa5J892WN0bHDYPtnQ--~B/aD01MDA7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/good_housekeeping_561/737a1375344f862a25fc27eb855424d6", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
