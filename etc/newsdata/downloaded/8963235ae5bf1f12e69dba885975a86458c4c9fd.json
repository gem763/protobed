A rise in support for outsider parties. Integration issues brought about by decades of mass immigration, exacerbated by the 2015 refugee flow. A European Union that has become so undemocratic that it is about to lose one of its key members.\n\nThere are several ways to approach these problems. You could think the answer lies with making the European Union more accountable. You could say that more power needs to reside locally. You could call for slowing down immigration. You could look at what other policies outsider parties are advocating and see if those issues could be addressed.\n\nOr, as is increasingly the case, you could say that it is all the Russians\u2019 fault.\n\nWe saw that with the election of Donald Trump. We saw it with Brexit. And, in the latest example from the New York Times, we are seeing it with Sweden.\n\nThe Times\u2019s Jo Becker highlights Russian and Western \u201cdisinformation\u201d media outlets targeting Sweden with xenophobic and anti-immigrant messaging. Anecdotes also emerge of Russian camera crews allegedly paying immigrants to cause havoc in an attempt to validate far-right claims. \u201cTo dig beneath the surface of what is happening in Sweden,\u201d the Times reports, \u201cis to uncover the workings of an international disinformation machine, devoted to the cultivation, provocation and amplification of far-right, anti-immigrant passions and political forces \u2026 most influentially rooted in Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Russia.\u201d\n\nSome facts about Sweden today: Sweden took in 163,000 asylum seekers in 2015. That\u2019s the equivalent of the U.S. taking 5.2 million, and it was the highest number per capita in Europe. Large numbers of asylum seekers arrived from Syria and Afghanistan in particular. Unsurprisingly, the bedding-in process has not been smooth. As the Financial Times reported in June, \u201cSweden has faced a sharp rise in deadly shootings, arson attacks, and the use of hand grenades in some of its poorest and most immigrant-heavy neighbourhoods in cities such as Malmo, Gothenburg and Stockholm.\u201d\n\nOr, as Paulina Neuding writes for Politico, \u201cGang-related gun murders, now mainly a phenomenon among men with immigrant backgrounds \u2026 increased from 4 per year in the early 1990s to around 40 last year.\u2026 Social unrest, with car torchings, attacks on first responders and even riots, is a recurring phenomenon. Shootings in the country have become so common that they don\u2019t make top headlines anymore, unless they are spectacular or lead to fatalities.\u201d\n\nSo there are many things to be said about Sweden in 2019. Claiming it has no issues beyond those whipped up by Russia should not be one of them.\n\nReaders may remember the response to President Trump telling a rally in February 2017, \u201cYou look at what\u2019s happening last night in Sweden.\u2026 They took in large numbers. They\u2019re having problems like they never thought possible.\u201d There was much merriment to be had in response. After all, nothing had happened the previous night other than a brief Fox News segment airing on Sweden. The #lastnightinsweden hashtag quickly spread, poking fun at Trump. Former foreign affairs minister Carl Bildt tweeted, \u201cWhat has he been smoking?\u201d\n\nAll good fun, but ultimately unsustainable because it did not take long for reality to bite. As the New York Times itself reported just hours after Trump\u2019s comments, a heavily immigrant area of Stockholm called Rinkeby saw dozens of masked men burn cars and fight with the police after a drug dealer was arrested. Shots were fired, and the interior minister described the incident as \u201cvery serious.\u201d\n\nCertainly, such issues are not all linked to the 2015 refugee flow, which exacerbated integration issues but did not create them. They are issues nonetheless. All of this makes the New York Times now warning that \u201cit was right around that time \u2026 that Russian television crews showed up, offering to pay immigrant youths \u2018to make trouble\u2019 in front of the cameras\u201d stick in the craw even more.\n\nI do not know whether that claim is true. It is not impossible. It is also not impossible that dropping hundreds of thousands of people from entirely different, war-scarred cultures into ultra-liberal Sweden has worked perfectly and any trouble is just Russian meddling. On the Occam\u2019s razor front, however, is it not a tad more likely that some people are simply not integrating terribly well or are behaving violently primarily for reasons unrelated to Russia?\n\nThe Times goes on to bemoan \u201chow many people in Sweden \u2026 seem to be warming to the nationalists\u2019 view: that immigration has brought crime, chaos and a fraying of the cherished social safety net, not to mention a withering away of national culture and tradition.\u201d Of course it is also possible that this is not because of a grand Russian master plan but because Swedes are seeing these things with their own two eyes, and their views are shifting accordingly.\n\nIt is unfair to single out the New York Times. The paper is not the only one pushing the line that Europe would be a peaceful utopia, a paragon of democratic accountability, were it not for Vladimir Putin and his troll farms.\n\nI grew up in Lincolnshire, England. It is a highly rural area, where incomes are below the national average. It has also been a strongly Euroskeptic area for decades. The notion that people there voted to leave the European Union because a Russian website retweeted some anti-EU stories was fantastically hilarious to me until it became clear that people in London and D.C. were taking it seriously. No one who has ever stepped foot inside Lincolnshire could believe it. This is, of course, part of the problem. Yes, the U.S. and UK are different countries; but then London and Lincolnshire may as well be, too.\n\nFor sure, Russia is headed by a brutal, authoritarian leader. It invaded and occupied Georgia and Ukraine in recent years. It carried out chemical attacks in the UK. It helped raze Syria to the ground. It interfered in the 2016 U.S. election and may try to do the same in 2020. And it almost certainly is trying to exploit and exacerbate Europe\u2019s current ills, looking for ways to harden divisions and exploiting social fissures. Clearly, it is a strategic adversary and should be treated as such.\n\nTo maintain, however, that the reason Europeans keep voting for ever more radical solutions is because the Russians told them to gives Europe\u2019s failing political class an undeserved easy out. Parts of the media seem happy to maintain this fiction. But it is unlikely to be one that most European voters will entertain.", "description": "Europe has problems: Trust in traditional center-right and center-left parties collapsing.
