Mars could heat up emotions though. So slow down and take things one step at a time.\n\nTAURUS April 21-May 21 ***\n\nFocus your time and attention on domestic matters today Taurus. And make sure you deal with each situation \u2013 and family member \u2013 thoroughly, before you move onto the next issue.\n\nGEMINI May 22-June 21 **\n\nYou\u2019re in a hurry to let people know what you\u2019re thinking and feeling today. But slow down! If you make thoughtless comments in a rush \u2013 in person and online \u2013 then you may regret it later on.\n\nCANCER June 22-July 23 ***\n\nThe focus is firmly on finances, as you strive to come up with better ways to manage money. If you can\u2019t handle it yourself, then don\u2019t hesitate to call on the expertise of an up-to-date professional.\n\nLEO July 24-Aug 23 ***\n\nEnergy and enthusiasm are high as the Moon moves through Leo. You\u2019re mentally alert and able to make decisions quickly but strive to be more sensitive towards the feelings of others.\n\nVIRGO Aug 24-Sep 23 ***\n\nToday will work best if you can balance being practical and productive with being creative and compassionate. You\u2019re busy but try to put aside some time to relax, meditate or contemplate.\n\nLIBRA Sep 24-Oct 23 ****\n\nBe proactive about making decisions. Your motto for the day is from fellow Libran, actress and activist Susan Sarandon. \u201cI take responsibility for the ups and downs of my life, and that is very liberating.\u201d\n\nSCORPIO Oct 24-Nov 22 ***\n\nDo your best to get the balance right between professional projects and spending quality time with your nearest and dearest.

Luckily the fiery Leo Moon gives you a welcome energy boost, so roll up your sleeves and get to work.\n\nCAPRICORN Dec 22-Jan 20 ***\n\nWhen it comes to joint finances or shared resources, utilise your intuition to zero in on what others require. Then do some behind-the-scenes work to get things moving in the right direction.\n\nAQUARIUS Jan 21-Feb 19 ***\n\nAll types of partnerships \u2013 romantic, platonic and business \u2013 are highlighted at the moment.

The next 12 months is the time to bring more balance into your busy world.\n\nCopyright Joanne Madeline Moore 2019", "description": "See what the stars have in store for you today.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7957/4b1bfe3a01fd448680843b429f03cc36.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
