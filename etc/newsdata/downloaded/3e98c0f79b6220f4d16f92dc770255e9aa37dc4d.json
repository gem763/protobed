A typical pack totals 500-600 calories in a ratio of 50-60% carbohydrates, 30% fat and 12-13% protein, Holladay said.\n\nMarine Corps Pvt.

Feedback will be collected through the end of October, giving officials a 95% confidence rate in the results.\n\nFrom there, the feedback will be used to design future nutrition packs. Holladay noted that tastes and preferences change over time with new generations of recruits, and the survey allows officials to stay current on popular items.\n\nThe rollout of performance nutrition packs at entry-level training, following a pilot program in fiscal 2016, mirrors efforts by other services to make sure trainees aren't limited by chow hall meal times when it comes to fueling up.\n\nThe Marine Corps dispenses roughly 1,500 of the packs each month at OCS and the two recruit depots in Parris Island, South Carolina and San Diego, Holladay said.\n\n\u2014 Hope Hodge Seck can be reached at hope.seck@military.com.
