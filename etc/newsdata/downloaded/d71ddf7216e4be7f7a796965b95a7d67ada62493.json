But editor David S. Miller stresses there\u2019s more to it than one might think. He describes the compilation of wild, first-person adventure stories pulled from the community of travel writers that comprise the Matador Network as a \u201cTrojan Horse:\u201d the sensationally-dubbed cover opens to reveal real cultural experiences.\n\nThe book\u2019s crazy title gave Miller pause when he was first approached about the project, but he soon realized there was a lot missing in the current travel literature. Most features flaunt the best beaches and sunsets, but they lack details on how visitors can have authentic cultural experiences. \u201cPeople are just trying to sell the destination,\u201d he says. But he wanted this book to provide readers with \u201cculture and stories you wouldn\u2019t find in every travel book.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole ethos behind the book is: it doesn\u2019t really matter where you go\u2026even in Antarctica or the middle of the Bolivian salt flats\u2026if you\u2019re the kind of person who isn\u2019t much of risk-taker, this is a time to get out and mix it up,\u201d says Miller.", "description": "Vacation is the time to kick back, relax\u2026and have one hell of a party.
