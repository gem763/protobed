Jackson, called him a 'truly class act'\n\nThe Rochester born actor launched his film career alongside heavyweight stars Elizabeth Taylor and Marlon Brando in John Huston's Reflections In A Golden Eye (1967).\n\nTwo years later he delivered a memorable performance as John Cassellis in Haskell Wexler's Medium Cool (1969).\n\nWith his chiseled good looks and steady, no-nonsense acting chops, Forster would bounce back between films and gust starring roles on television throughout his entire career.\n\nSteady: The actor, whose resume dates back five decades, has credited Quentin Tarantino for reviving his career when the famed writer-director cast him as Max Cherry in Jackie Brown (1997); Forster's performance earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor\n\nThe 1980's would mark a downturn in his career, both in the quality and quantity of roles.\n\n'I went 21 months without a job. I had four kids, I took any job I could get,' Forster told the Chicago Tribune in 2018.\n\n'Every time it reached a lower level I thought I could tolerate, it dropped some more, and then some more. Near the end I had no agent, no manager, no lawyer, no nothing. I was taking whatever fell through the cracks.'\n\nForster has publicly credited Quentin Tarantino for reviving his career when the famed writer-director cast him as bail bondsman Max Cherry in his much acclaimed ode to 1970s blaxploitation films -- Jackie Brown (1997).\n\nThat performance, alongside Pam Grier and Samuel L. Jackson, earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nMemorable: Many fans also know Forster for his Breaking Bad and El Camino role as Ed Galbraith, the vacuum salesman who specializes in relocating criminals running from the law; he is pictured with Break Bad star actor Bryan Cranston (Walter White) in a 2013 episode\n\nCranston paid tribute to Forster on Twitter, calling him a 'lovely man and consummate actor'\n\nJackie Brown would open the floodgates to a bevy of roles in such movies as Psycho (1998), Me, Myself & Irene (2000), Mulholland Dr. (2001), Human Nature (2001), Like Mike (2002), Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (2003), Firewall (2006), Lucky Number Slevin (2006) and The Descendants (2011).\n\nMany fans also know him for his Breaking Bad role as Ed Galbraith, the vacuum salesman who specializes in relocating criminals running from the law, and giving them new identities.\n\nHe reprised the character to perfection in the newly released Breaking Bad sequel movie, El Camino.\n\nForster is survived by his four children, four grandchildren and his longtime partner, Denise Grayson.", "description": "Forster died at his home in Los Angeles on Friday, just hours after El Camino premiered in theaters and on Netflix, after a brief battle with brain cancer.", "authors": ["Kevin Kayhart For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/07/19618692-0-image-a-67_1570860187478.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
