There are many middlemen involved, including the record label, Glitter\u2019s agent and sometimes a \u2018synchronisation\u2019 agent, with artists sometimes only receiving a measly amount from the deal.\"\n\nDespite this, many audiences were still uncomfortable that Glitter could see any money from the use of his song.\n\n\"Well, I don't want a single penny of my money going to a child rapist, so I guess I will miss out on this movie,\" one user wrote.\n\nIMDB\n\nOthers advised people to Google his name before choosing to watch the movie, which reportedly earned $234 million (\u20ac212 million) on its opening weekend.\n\n\"The film\u2019s about how child abuse can impact people and #WarnerBros are paying a paedophile for his track,\" another Twitter user said.\n\nHe added: \"Mental. Saw it last Friday and it was boring. Two reasons not to watch it for everyone else.\"\n\nGary Glitter - whose real name is Paul Gadd - is currently serving a 16-year sentence for sexually abusing young girls.\n\nHis offences include a charge of attempted rape and having sex with a girl under the age of 13.\n\nWarner Brothers has not yet responded to Euronews' request for comment.", "description": "The Joker movie, which broke box office records on opening weekend has been widely criticised after it used a song written by a convicted British paedophile in its soundtrack.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/21/50/32/1000x563_cmsv2_de753a71-c200-5497-894d-be678a8ffc7e-4215032.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
