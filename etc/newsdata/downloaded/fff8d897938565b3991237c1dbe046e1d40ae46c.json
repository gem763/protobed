We need someone to bring fresh thinking to the Bank of England and I think she would do exactly that.\u2019\n\nLabour MP and Commons business select committee chairman Rachel Reeves, who was an economist at the Bank of England between 2000 and 2006, said of her time there: \u2018There weren\u2019t enough women in senior positions.\n\nIf that is about to change, by putting a woman right at the top of the Bank, it would send a signal to financial institutions that they too need to appoint more women and close the gender pay gap.\u2019\n\nDame Helena stepped down from her job running Legal & General\u2019s personal investment business to chase the goal of becoming the Bank's first female governor\n\nTory MP Steve Baker, a member of the Treasury select committee and head of the European Research Group, said she would be an \u2018outstanding candidate\u2019.\n\nDame Helena, who is married to a Buddhist monk, is thought to have been one of nine candidates interviewed to succeed Carney. Other women thought to be contenders include Santander UK chairman Baroness Vadera and Dame Minouche Shafik, head of the London School of Economics.\n\nDame Helena leaves her job at Legal & General Investment Management on October 21. In a statement on Friday she said: \u2018I see a changing Britain and have a lot of ideas and other things I want to achieve. I am looking forward to the next phase of my career at a time of great change and opportunity.\u2019\n\nThe Treasury would not comment on the appointment process.", "description": "Dame Helena Morrissey has been lent the support of MPs and former Bank officials who lined up to praise the Brexiteer as she aims to become the first female governor of the Bank of England.", "authors": ["William Turvill", "Harriet Dennys For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/02/19348968-0-image-a-25_1570325202155.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
