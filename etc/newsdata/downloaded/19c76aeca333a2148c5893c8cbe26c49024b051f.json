The Wall Street Journal reported that those at the hearing took her comments to refer to the \"investigation that could implicate Biden and his son.\"\n\nBoth Bolton and Hill, who were present at the meeting, had concerns about the conversation, she testified. Bolton directed her to alert John Eisenberg, a lawyer at the NSC, she said, the Journal reported.\n\nFEDERAL PROSECUTORS LOOK INTO GIULIANI'S BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH UKRAINE\n\nThe New York Times reported that during the meeting, Bolton got into a heated exchange with Gordon D. Sondland, the European Union ambassador. The paper reported that Sondland worked with Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, to pressure the Ukrainians to investigate the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Hill reportedly said Bolton likened the former New York City mayor to a \u201chand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up.\u201d She said it appeared Giuliani was not working in coordination with the normal foreign policy channels when dealing with Ukraine.\n\nGiuliani has said in the past that he worked in conjunction with the State Department, the Journal reported.\n\nThe Times, citing two people familiar with the testimony, reported that Hill said Bolton told her to tell Eisenberg that Giuliani was working with the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, on the rogue investigation.\n\n\u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal Rudy and Mulvaney are cooking up,\u201d Bolton reportedly told White House attorneys. The Washington Post reported that investigators are now considering calling Bolton to testify. Sondland is expected to testify later this week.\n\nFox News sent an after-hours email to spokespersons for Giuliani, Bolton, and Sondland and did not get an immediate response. Hill did not immediately respond to other media outlets including the Times and Journal.\n\nPresident Trump has insisted that any request for Kiev to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, was to make sure the country was working to weed out corruption. Trump expressed doubts about how Hunter Biden could land a $50,000-a-month job at a Ukrainian gas company with little to no experience in the sector or country.\n\nJoe Biden said he played no role in his son\u2019s business career. Democrats claim that Trump used the power of his office to try to damage a political opponent.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cThere was an official foreign policy, which was attempting to counter corruption in Ukraine. And then there was Rudy Giuliani, and, you know, the gang that couldn\u2019t shoot straight who worked for him, who were\u2026connected with corruption in Ukraine and promoting the corruption in Ukraine,\u201d said Rep.
