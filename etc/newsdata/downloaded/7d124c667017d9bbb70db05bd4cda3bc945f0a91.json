Given where we were at the beginning of the week and at the risk of being cynical, a deal still seems quite a long way off given the distance between both sides relative positions, and recent comments from Michel Barnier that neither side is in a position where we are able to find an agreement.\n\nIn short this pathway to a deal could well be a road to nowhere, we shall see!\n\nOn US, China trade we\u2019ve also seen rising optimism after President Trump said that talks were going well and that he would be meeting Chinese vice Premier Liu He later today. There is no doubt that a pause in further tariffs would be welcome, while a partial agreement on aspects that were agreed before the breakdown in talks would also be positive.\n\nThe question is on whether either side can sell this at home, with Chinese leaders also under pressure to not be seen to bend too much.\n\nAs we head into the weekend European markets look set to build on the gains seen in US and Asia markets, with the opening at its best levels in over a week, while the is lagging behind, largely as a result of the surge higher in the value of the pound, though Brexit sensitive stocks like Lloyds (LON: ), RBS (LON: ) as well Taylor Wimpey (LON: ), Barratt Developments (LON: ) and Tesco (LON: ), all helping support the index.\n\nOn the companies front WPP (LON: ) shares have slid sharply after sector counterpart Publicis warned on its 2019 revenue guidance, the second such warning in three months. Publicis appears to have been caught out by the move towards digital marketing, away from the more traditional TV and billboard advertising, with Europe a particular source of concern.\n\nThere\u2019s been better news for software group SAP after the company posted Q3 numbers that were better than expected, while also reaffirming expectations for this year and next year\u2019s forecasts. The company also announced that Bill McDermott was stepping down as CEO to be replaced by Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein. The co-CEO model seems to be becoming more popular in recent times but it can be something that is fraught with difficulties. It also speaks to indecisiveness in that the board is reluctant to make a choice, and as such the corporate message can become muddled if there are differences at the top.\n\nprices are also on the rise on reports that an Iranian oil tanker is on fire off the coast of Saudi Arabia, having come under missile attack, from an unknown source. The Iranians may well look to blame Saudi Arabia, with the National Iranian Tanker Company saying that the rockets came from Saudi Arabia.\n\nComing as it has only weeks after an attack on Aramco\u2019s refining capacity, markets are understandably nervous, however the move higher in prices is still fairly modest, when compared to yesterday\u2019s gains which were driven by speculation about further OPEC cuts\n\nUS markets look set to open higher as we head into the weekend ahead of President Trumps meeting with Chinese vice premier Liu He\n\nJones is expected to open 140 points higher at 26,636\n\nS&P500 is expected to open 16 points higher at 2,954\n\n\"DISCLAIMER: CMC Markets is an execution only provider.
