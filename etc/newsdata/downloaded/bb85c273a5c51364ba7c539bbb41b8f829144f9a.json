(Picture: Metro.co.uk)\n\nEver been in bed when you\u2019ve noticed an itch on your breast you just can\u2019t get rid of?\n\nOr maybe you\u2019re at work when your boob feels urgently itchy, and you have to go to the bathroom to adjust your bra and give yourself a good scratch in the process.\n\nHaving especially itchy boobs is common and totally normal. An itch on the breasts usually happens for the exact same reason as an itch in any other area \u2013 a stimulation of nerve endings.\n\nBut at some point in the world of urban mythology, someone started spreading the rumour that having mildly itchy boobs means you obviously have breast cancer. Cue everyone with the tiniest sensation in their chest area having a massive worry meltdown.\n\nDr Clare Morrison, GP and medical advisor at Medexpress, tells Metro.co.uk that itchy boobs are rarely anything to panic about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s true that itching in the breast can be a sign of breast cancer \u2013 inflammatory breast cancer, specifically, which can cause redness, inflammation, pain, and swelling \u2013 but this is pretty rare. There are other causes of itching that are far more likely.\n\n\u2018Itchy boobs are far more likely to have a non-threatening explanation,\u2019 Dr Clare tells us.\n\n\u2018Itchy boobs occur when there is irritation of the skin. This may be due to swelling or inflammation of the breasts, such as in pregnancy, premenstrual changes, or hormone medication, including contraceptives.\n\n\u2018It may also be due to skin complaints such as dermatitis, dry skin, sunburn, or allergies.\n\n\u2018Like the rest of the body, the skin of the breasts is subject to any skin disorder, such as dryness, eczema (also known as dermatitis), psoriasis, allergies, insect bites and infections.\n\n\u2018Itchiness of the exposed parts of the breasts and upper chest can be caused by sunburn, and sun allergy.\u2019\n\nCheck your breasts regularly (Picture: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nAlongside skin conditions, having itchy breasts can be a result of chafing due to activity (going running with a badly fitting sports bra might cause your boobs to jump around quite a bit) or a bra made from synthetic materials that aggravate the skin.\n\nDr Clare adds: \u2018Itchiness between the breasts is commonly caused by excessive heat and sweating. This may lead to sweat rash, pimples, and yeast infections.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s important to wear a bra that fits properly and feels comfortable.\u2019\n\n\u2018Underneath the breasts, the trapped moisture encourages skin infections, which can be bacterial or fungal. An itchy rash occurring between skin folds like this, is known as intertrigo.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo if you\u2019ve got itchy breasts, what next?\n\nYour first port of call is to account for any of the obvious reasons we\u2019ve just mentioned before you ring the doctor.\n\nIs your bra uncomfortable and poorly fitting? Have you just done a sweaty workout? Do you have dry, irritated skin in other areas? Are you breastfeeding?\n\nIf none of these things apply, it\u2019s worth keeping track of itching and noting down how often it occurs \u2013 as well as pondering if this has been a longterm experience or something that\u2019s a sudden change.\n\nIf your itchy boobs come on suddenly, last for a long time, come with other symptoms, and aren\u2019t clearly down to any of the things we mentioned, it\u2019s then time to talk to your doctor so they can give you a proper checkup.\n\n\u2018If the itch persists through different stages of the menstrual cycle, and doesn\u2019t respond to simple measures, do think about the possibility of something more serious, such as breast cancer,\u2019 says Dr Clare.\n\n\u2018The concern is greater if only one side is affected, if the problem has come on out of the blue for the first time ever, or if there are risk factors such as a family history of breast cancer.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Go to the doctor if the itch is accompanied by more worrying symptoms such as a lump, dimpling of the skin, nipple inversion, or pain.\n\n\u2018Also seek medical attention if the itch doesn\u2019t respond to simple treatment.\n\n\u2018Occasionally an itchy breast can be a feature of inflammatory breast cancer. This is a serious, aggressive cancer that has spread from the underlining breast tissue to the skin. Tumours that do this, have a poorer prognosis than other types of breast cancer.\n\n\u2018If you notice any persistent changes to the breast skin, it\u2019s important to get them checked out by your GP.\u2019\n\nPagets disease of the breast \u2013 which looks like eczema of the nipple but is in fact breast cancer \u2013 is extremely rare.\n\nAnd again, just because your itchy breasts don\u2019t have an obvious cause, that doesn\u2019t automatically mean you have cancer.\n\nYou could also have an infection, such as thrush, which can cause similar sensations, or be experiencing a hormonal change.\n\nIf your doctor has given you the all-clear and your itchy boobs are more annoying than worrying, there are some simple things you can to do reduce the need to scratch.\n\nThe key, of course, is avoiding whatever is causing the problem, whether that\u2019s cheap bras, strong perfumes, or sunburn.\n\nMake sure to wear a well-fitting bra, use moisturiser, and chat to a GP or dermatologist if you\u2019re struggling with skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis.\n\nAnd finally, well done for being aware of the sensations of your boobs. Combine that with regular checks and you\u2019re doing great.\n\nHow to check your breasts: Check your breasts regularly and get to know what\u2019s normal for you. If you notice any changes, talk to your doctor. To check your breasts, look at them and feel each breast and armpit and up to your collarbone. It can be easier if you do this in the shower or bath, by running a soapy hand over each breast and up under each armpit. You want a firm, smooth touch with the first few finger pads of your hands, keeping fingers flat and together and moving in a circular motion.\n\nSigns of breast cancer to watch out for Women are advised to start checking their breasts in their 20s. A lump definitely isn\u2019t the only thing to watch out for, but if you don\u2019t know what else you need to be aware of, here\u2019s a very simple guide: Change in breast size or shape Boobs are wonderful things that come in all shapes and sizes. But if yours starts to change outside your menstrual window or pregnancy, then it might be a warning sign. Keep checking them so you know what they look like regularly and are able to chart any changes. An inverted nipple Some people are born with inverted nipples\u2026but if yours suddenly starts to go inwards or changes shape in any way, it might be worth having checked out. Redness, rashes or skin sores We all get rashes from time to time but if you develop one anywhere on the boob or around the nipple that won\u2019t go away, visit your GP. Nipple discharge If liquid comes out of your nipple without squeezing it, get it checked. Indentation A dent of any size isn\u2019t normal. Swelling under the armpit or collarbone Often you can get swelling under the armpit around your period but if it doesn\u2019t go away when your period does, get it checked. Change in skin texture If the skin around your nipples become dimply or start to resemble orange peel, get it checked out. Constant pain Boobs can feel sore but they shouldn\u2019t ache all the time. A growing vein Normally, you can\u2019t see veins on your breasts so if one does become apparent and seems to be growing, head to you GP as it might be a sign of a tumour blocking a blood vessel. A lump It\u2019s the most common sign but not the only one. If you can feel a lump on the inside (it doesn\u2019t have to be visible), get it checked out. Make sure you\u2026or your partner (as good a reason as any) regularly feel your boobs for any lumps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: 10 women from the same family who all had breast cancer celebrate getting the all-clear with a charity calendar\n\nMORE: Why you should wear Wear It Pink this Friday and how it can help the fight for breast cancer survival\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Itchy boobs can be a sign of breast cancer, but it's far more likely due to another cause.
