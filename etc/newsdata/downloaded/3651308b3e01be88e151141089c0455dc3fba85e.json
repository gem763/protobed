This year's show displayed more than $4.3 billion worth of yachts with an average price of about $41 million. The show is attended by industry insiders such as shipbuilders, designers, and brokers, as well as affluent individuals from all around the world who are looking to buy or charter a yacht.\n\nThis year, I was one of approximately 30,000 people who attended the Monaco Yacht Show.\n\nRead more: Here's what it's like to attend the Monaco Yacht Show \u2014 in a country where the poverty rate is 0 \u2014 when you are not a millionaire\n\nMonaco is a country smaller than New York City's Central Park, yet it's one of the most lavishly wealthy nations in the world. An estimated one-third of Monaco residents are millionaires, and the GDP per capita is $166,021 \u2014 the second highest in the world after Lichtenstein. And according to the CIA World Factbook, no portion of Monaco's population lives below the poverty line.\n\nAs a journalist with a decidedly non-millionaire salary, I expected to feel out of place in Monaco \u2014 but I couldn't know to what extent until I got there.\n\nLamborghinis, Chanel, and Goyard: The wealth in Monaco is not exactly subtle\n\nIn Monte Carlo, Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Range Rovers, BMWs, and other high-end cars were everywhere I looked. Seemingly every woman I saw was carrying a designer handbag, whether it's Chanel, Louis Vuitton, or the elusive but even more esteemed Goyard.\n\nLamborghinis, Range Rovers, and Ferraris were everywhere in Monte Carlo. Katie Warren/Business Insider\n\nIndeed, most of the shopping in the district is catered to millionaires. There's M\u00e9tropole Shopping Monte-Carlo, an upscale underground shopping center with 80 high-end boutiques, steps from the famous casino. And in the other direction are shops like Cartier, C\u00e9line, Prada, and Balenciaga.\n\nThe only non-designer stores I saw in Monte Carlo were a Zara and Nike boutique.\n\nNightly rates at the trifecta of luxury hotels in Monaco start around $400\n\nMy first night in Monaco, I got to stay at the opulent Hotel Metropole Monte-Carlo, where rooms start at $417 and cost upwards of $8,500 for the most luxurious suites. The hotel sits in the city's glitzy Carr\u00e9 d'Or district that surrounds Monte Carlo's Casino Square, named after the famous Casino de Monte Carlo, where gamblers have won more than $317 million over the past year.\n\nA suite at the luxurious Hotel Metropole Monte-Carlo can cost upwards of $8,500. Katie Warren/Business Insider\n\nMy night at Hotel Metropole, with its five-star amenities and central location, was a luxurious experience made possible only by the media discount the hotel offered my company. At Monaco's other hotels, such as Hotel Hermitage and Hotel de Paris, nightly rates start at almost $400.\n\nThe rest of the week, I stayed in the nearby French city of Nice in an Airbnb that cost less than $100 per night. From there, I commuted about 30 minutes into Monaco, which drastically changed my experience. Every evening, I had to walk to the Monaco train station, ride the train 20 minutes back to Nice, and then take a 10-minute Uber ride (or a 35-minute walk) back to my Airbnb. On a couple of occasions, I had to make that journey twice in one day.\n\nWith the trains stopping well before midnight, this made a night out in Monaco nearly impossible unless I wanted to spend 90 euros \u2014 almost $100 \u2014 on a taxi to take me the 14 miles back to Nice.\n\nGetting around is exhausting for those without deep pockets\n\nVIP guests of the yacht show \u2014 those with provable interest and means to buy or charter a yacht \u2014 could hitch rides around Monaco thanks to the yacht show's courtesy cars.\n\nFor the rest of us, transportation was trickier. While Monaco is small, it's full of steep hills, cobblestoned streets, and many, many stairs, making walking everywhere exhausting. Uber does not exist in Monaco, and I learned the hard way that the elusive taxis are as expensive as everything else in Monaco.\n\nWhen I checked out of Hotel Metropole, I asked the hotel to call me a taxi to take me to the train station, so I could check in and drop off my luggage at my Airbnb in Nice. That was when I learned of the 15 euro \u2014 or about $16.50 \u2014 minimum charge for taking a taxi anywhere within Monaco \u2014 even a three-minute drive to the train station. As a reminder, Monaco spans just 0.78 square miles.\n\nThe Monaco Yacht Show offered courtesy cars \u2014 but only for VIP guests. Katie Warren/Business Insider\n\nAnd taking a taxi to somewhere outside of Monaco will cost you 90 euros, or almost $100.\n\nMonaco does have city buses, but they never showed up as an option on Google Maps \u2014 which I, and many people, rely on to navigate a city these days \u2014 and they stop running at 9:30 p.m. On weekends, a night bus runs until 4:00 a.m., but as it wouldn't take me back to Nice, that didn't help me much.\n\nI felt this lack of transportation options acutely throughout my stay, especially after I attended a ritzy kickoff gala the night before the yacht show. After the gala, private cars and yacht show courtesy cars were parked outside the venue to drive VIPs the four or five minutes back to their hotels, such as the Metropole.\n\nBut as a non-VIP and a non-millionaire unable to shell out $100 for a taxi back to Nice, I walked uphill and up seemingly endless stairs to the train station, finally making it back to my Airbnb over an hour after leaving the party.\n\nTo get to Monaco's train station perched on a steep hillside, you have to walk up quite a few stairs. Katie Warren/Business Insider\n\nMonaco really is a playground for millionaires\n\nOther parts of Monaco seemed a bit more low-key, but around the Monte Carlo district and Port Hercules, where all the hustle and bustle for the yacht show was taking place, the city was an exhibition of lavish wealth.\n\nI felt strangely relieved to get back to Nice every night, back to what felt like the \"real world\" with its regular people not decked in head-to-toe designer duds or driving Ferraris.\n\nWhile it was fun getting a peek into the glamorous Monaco lifestyle, the outrageously high prices \u2014and the presence of so many people who can actually afford them \u2014 made it clear Monaco is not quite meant for someone like me.", "description": "About\u00a0one-third of Monaco's residents are millionaires, and the ultra-wealthy converge on the French Riviera city-state for the glitzy Monaco Yacht Show.", "authors": ["Katie Warren"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9c9a1952887948fd053eac?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
