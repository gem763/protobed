Last year I came here with some anxiety about my boxing ability.\n\n\u201cI believed in my fitness and athleticism and how hard I worked but I did not feel like a boxer, I felt like a YouTuber who was pretending.\n\n\u201cNow my boxing will speak for itself, the confidence has risen.\n\n\u201cI am confused by the people who think he wins. I understand his fans wanting him to win but what the f*** are they thinking? I will end this man.\n\n\u201cLast year I f***** around and showboated but this time it will just be a knockout.\u201d", "description": "Logan Paul is setting his sights on a move to the octagon after his boxing rematch with KSI.
