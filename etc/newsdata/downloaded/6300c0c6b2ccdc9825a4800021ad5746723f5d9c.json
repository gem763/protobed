Oil means the end, but art means the beginning.\"\n\nThe National Portrait Gallery said BP's support for its Portrait Award encouraged the work of artists around the world and enabled free admission to an exhibition, which had drawn more than 300,000 visitors this year.\n\n\"The ongoing debate around BP\u2019s sponsorship of the arts raises important questions about both the environment and arts funding, and we are listening carefully to voices on all sides,\" the gallery said in a statement.
