A smaller number of arrests were made at a \u201cdie in\u201d outside New York\u2019s stock exchange, with protesters subsequently blocking a nearby road to traffic.\n\nProtests are also taking place in other US cities, including Washington DC and Chicago, as part of a global week of action by the UK-founded activist group, which is seeking to make its first major mark in America.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Climate crisis activists demonstrate in New York City where Extinction Rebellion organizers expect several thousand to congregate this week.

Climate breakdown is under way and we can\u2019t afford to wait.\u201d\n\nExtinction Rebellion has a philosophy of nonviolent direct action aimed at pushing governments to confront the climate crisis. A key demand is that planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions are reduced to net zero within six years.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A climate crisis activist covered in fake blood is arrested in New York City during the Extinction Rebellion demonstration.

Activists are hoping for a similar impact in the US, despite concerns over a more aggressive style of policing and an unsympathetic federal government, led by Donald Trump, that actively promotes fossil fuels and is regularly derisive of climate science.\n\n\u201cWe need to account for the damage caused by fossil fuels because we have the chance of losing it all,\u201d said Jim Navarre, a protestor from New York\u2019s Long Island who help up a sign reading \u201cYou can\u2019t comb over climate change\u201d with a picture of Trump\u2019s hair atop the globe.\n\nExtinction Rebellion: dozens of arrests as activists block London roads Read more\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Climate crisis activists gather in Battery Park during Extinction Rebellion demonstrations in New York.

Tombstones mentioning hurricanes and fires made worse by the climate crisis were held aloft, along with a coffin with the words \u201cOur future\u201d written on the side. A New Orleans-style funereal band played for the several hundred protestors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a powerful message,\u201d Landowne said. \u201cBut more than death I fear living amongst the terror of people killing each other for water and food.\u201d", "description": "Demonstrators were arrested in a wave of US protests that are part of a global week of action by the UK-based group", "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c80fc8f10f961dcad525cab3696e039e800b2bf3/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=179ff3ba85f8bce94ddfdfc157e20031", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
