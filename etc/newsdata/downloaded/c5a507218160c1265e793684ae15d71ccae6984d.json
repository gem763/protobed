As Lorenzo Reyes details, the league's elite class is starting to crystalize. USA TODAY\n\nThe Miami Dolphins are trading away another veteran contributor.\n\nRunning back Kenyan Drake was dealt to the Arizona Cardinals on Monday in exchange for a conditional 2020 NFL draft pick, the Cardinals confirmed.\n\nThe pick is a sixth-round selection that could become a fifth rounder, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nDrake, 25, is in the final year of his rookie contract. He did not travel with the team to its Monday night matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers in advance of Tuesday's trade deadline.\n\nDespite being part of a timeshare backfield with Kalen Ballage and Mark Walton, Drake was Miami's leading rusher with 174 yards on 47 carries. He also had 174 receiving yards on 22 catches.\n\nThe 2016 third-round pick becomes the latest player to be cast off from the now-winless Dolphins in recent months. In late August, left tackle Laremy Tunsil and wide receiver Kenny Stills were sent to the Houston Texans. Linebacker Kiko Alonso was dealt to the New Orleans Saints the following day.\n\nMiami also traded second-year safety Minkah Fitzpatrick to Pittsburgh in September.\n\nWith two expected compensatory selections, the Dolphins would now have 13 draft picks in 2020, including three in the first round and two in the second.\n\nDrake could be put to work quickly in Arizona, as running back David Johnson was inactive for Sunday's loss to the Saints while dealing with an ankle injury and Chase Edmonds did not return after hurting his hamstring. The Cardinals play the 7-0 San Francisco 49ers at home on Thursday night.\n\nFollow Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz on Twitter @MikeMSchwartz.", "description": "The Miami Dolphins cast off yet another veteran contributor by sending Kenyan Drake to the Arizona Cardinals in a trade.", "authors": ["Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz", "Published A.M.
