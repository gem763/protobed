He was hit with a 10-second stop-and-go penalty for his part in the incident.\n\nHamilton\u2019s late error allowed Bottas to reduce the championship deficit to 63 points with seven rounds left.\n\n\u201cWhat a race,\u201d said Leclerc. \u201cI have never been so tired. I made a few mistakes, but in the end I finished first so I am very happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cCharles did a great job,\u201d said Hamilton. \u201cHe came under a lot of pressure from Valtteri and I. I did the best I could, but following so closely for so many laps, the tyres just went off the cliff. It was not our day.\u201d\n\nLeclerc\u2019s credentials were tested to the absolute limit as Hamilton hunted the 21-year-old around the high-speed Monza track.\n\nLeclerc was shown a black-and-white flag, Formula One\u2019s version of a yellow card, after Hamilton claimed he was pushed off the road by the Ferrari driver.\n\nOn lap 23, Hamilton launched an attack on Leclerc at the second chicane, but was forced to take to the run-off area.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t leave me a car\u2019s width,\u201d said Hamilton on the radio. \u201cHe pushed me off.\u201d\n\nThirteen laps later, Leclerc then ran over the kerbs at the first chicane but rejoined in front of Hamilton.\n\n\u201cThere is some dangerous driving going on,\u201d said Hamilton. The stewards noted the incident but took no further action.\n\nThe partisan Ferrari fans stood on their feet to applaud Leclerc as he whistled past on the main straight, and they burst into unanimous cheers when Hamilton was forced to take to the escape road after going too hot on his brakes at the first corner.\n\nBottas took over second position as Hamilton stopped for a set of fresh tyres, claiming a bonus point for the fastest lap of the race in the closing stages.\n\nBottas lined up a move on Leclerc for the win with just two laps to run, but the Finn locked up, affording Leclerc much-needed breathing space.\n\nThe Renault duo of Daniel Ricciardo and Nico Hulkenberg finished fourth and fifth ahead of Red Bull\u2019s Alex Albon.", "description": "Charles Leclerc survived an onslaught from Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas to win a thrilling Italian Grand Prix.
