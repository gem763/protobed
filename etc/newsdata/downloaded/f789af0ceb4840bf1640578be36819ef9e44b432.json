It\u2019s so much better having a clear head and it\u2019s great to be alive and well.\n\n\u201cI have had one or two shandies but I haven\u2019t touched a drop of the sauce for nearly 18 months now.\u201d\n\nRicky also reveals how he loves dressing up in traditional painter\u2019s garb and is inspired by masters such as Picasso and Vincent van Gogh.\n\n(Image: John Gladwin/Sunday Mirror)\n\nHe jokes that he calls himself \u201cRicasso\u201d and wants to cut off his ear.\n\nAnd he takes great delight in telling how he has sold some of his creations to raise money for the charities he supports, including Claire House children\u2019s hospice, Human Milk Bank, Ronald McDonald House, Alder Hey Hospital and the Walking With Giants Foundation.\n\nIn a nod to the 1966 No1 by Liverpool legends The Beatles, he says: \u201cPainting started as a bit of fun and a way to raise a few bob, but now I really do get hypnotised by it.\n\n(Image: John Gladwin/Sunday Mirror)\n\n\"I completely lose myself in painting. I love it. I painted a completely blue square on a blank canvas I bought from the pound shop. I called it \u2018Yellow Submarine\u2019.\n\n\u201cSome soft sod paid \u00a340 for it and then asked me where the submarine is. I told them it was under the bloody water.\u201d\n\nAs Ricky holds court in the conservatory of his house filled with children\u2019s toys and mementos from a colourful life, his devoted wife Rita hands out tea and toast.\n\nThe couple celebrated his 80th birthday last month with a Mediterranean cruise and a low-key party at The Florence Institute, a community centre where he is patron.\n\nDespite undergoing a quadruple heart bypass in 2012, suffering from asthma and a skin disease called nodular prurigo, Ricky is in rude health and bubbling with fun.\n\nBut life has not always been so rosy for the man who grew up in the terraces of Everton.\n\nHe has known his share of heartache and was once slung in jail after being branded a union troublemaker.\n\nNow a household name after playing Jim Royle in The Royle Family and Bobby Grant in Brookside, he really did have a rags-to-riches rise to fame.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nHe worked on building sites during the day while playing the banjo and doing stand-up in tough working men\u2019s clubs at night.\n\nAfter being jailed in the 1970s he emerged from prison penniless and unemployable.\n\nHe recalls: \u201cI was blacklisted from every building site in the north. Then I saw an advert asking for extras who had trade union and strike experience. Me and a mate drove down to London the next day.\n\n\u201cThat was when the director Roland Joffe walked into my life. I had a bit of row with the fella and I stormed out.\n\n\"I thought I\u2019d blown it. Then, out of the blue, he called me and ask if I could do a workshop.\n\n\u201cI turned up with a joiner and a van loaded with building materials. I thought he wanted me to build the bloody thing!\u201d\n\nJoffe cast Ricky in what was to become an award-winning drama called United Kingdom.\n\nScreenwriter and maverick TV entrepreneur Phil Redmond spotted him in it and signed him up for the part of Bobby Grant.\n\nOne role that struck a particularly poignant chord with him was that of tragic dad John Glover in Jimmy McGovern\u2019s film Hillsborough.\n\nIt echoed the death of his own son Clinton \u2013 one of three children with ex-wife Marlene \u2013 after a long battle with drink.\n\nRicky says: \u201cJohn Glover lost his son Ian at Hillsborough and his other son Joe has carried the scars of that terrible day. I know how it feels to lose a child.\u201d\n\nThe star believes he was made for the part of Jim Royle, playing the layabout dad alongside Sue Johnston, Craig Cash and Caroline Aherne, who died in 2016 aged 52.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHe says: \u201cMeeting Caroline and playing Jim Royle was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\n\"Caroline was such a wonderfully warm human being. She was a great British talent and is sadly missed.\u201d\n\nUnlike TV tightwad Jim, Ricky has given a fortune to charities and made sure his family are debt-free by paying off all their mortgages.\n\nHis talents are still in demand too, though he says no sometimes.\n\nHe says: \u201cOne of the big online gambling companies approached me to do an advert, but I said no. I don\u2019t gamble. I didn\u2019t want to know.\u201d\n\nA Royle reunion is on the cards with Jim and Antony, played by Ralf Little, coming together for a new six-part show called Ricky And Ralf\u2019s Very Northern Road Trip.\n\nRicky laughs: \u201cWe\u2019re sharing a campervan. We were in Blackpool and I told him the Ferris wheel was the UK\u2019s biggest.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been narrating a series called Made in Britain so he reckoned I knew my stuff.\n\n\u201cHe looked at me and said, \u2018Really? I didn\u2019t know that\u2019. And I said to him, \u2018Yes \u2013 you should see the size of the bloody hamster!\u2019\n\n\u201cWith my gravelly voice and Scouse accent, who\u2019d have thought that I\u2019d be a voice-over star? But Made in Britain is brilliant.\u201d\n\nThe 10-part series looks at how iconic brands \u2013 such as Bird\u2019s Eye frozen peas and Aunt Bessie\u2019s yorkshire puddings \u2013 are made.\n\nMade in Britain, ITV4, Wednesdays at 8pm, or catch up on the ITV Hub.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Acting legend Ricky Tomlinson, 80, on why he\u2019s ditched alcohol to take up painting, and how he still misses the late Caroline Aherne", "authors": ["Joe Cusack", "Image", "John Gladwin Sunday Mirror", "Bbc", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20728921.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PROD-JGP_MSM_211019Ricky_046JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
