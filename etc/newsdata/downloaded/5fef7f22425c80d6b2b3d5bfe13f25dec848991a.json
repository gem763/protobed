The people say about the Champions League, that target. We still are not ready.\n\n\u201cWe create a lot and don\u2019t concede but we can improve. We have scored a lot over the last two seasons and I don\u2019t have doubts about that but we have to keep going, to work on that.\u201d", "description": "Pep Guardiola has claimed that Manchester City are \u201cnot ready\u201d to win the Champions League because they are not clinical enough in attack.", "authors": ["Sam Dean", "Keith Hackett", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/20/TELEMMGLPICT000213517622-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqMN5csm4pVABgsgmM1fiIikS7DJv_ZtR2aEUv10dgoQM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
