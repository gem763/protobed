It was captured on a Facebook video. He was unarmed.\n\nThe cop was acquitted of murder in March but Rose's family pushed on with their civil lawsuit.\n\nTeenager Antwon Rose was shot and killed by white cop Michael Rosfeld in June 2018 in East Pittsburgh\n\nRoses mother Michelle Kenney is pictured in March after the cop's acquittal on murder charges\n\nIt was dismissed on Tuesday in light of the settlement.\n\nThe teenager's family will pay $800,000 to two law firms which represented them and keep the rest of the settlement for themselves.\n\nS. Lee Merritt, a lawyer for the family, told The New York Times the family 'wasn't particularly happy' with the amount they received but that it was 'the best the city could do.'\n\n'The goal for the lawsuit was to come up with a figure that would cause police officers in the East Pittsburgh area to think before they pull the trigger and force the city to consider better training,' he said.\n\nFootage of the moment Rosfeld shot dead Rose as he fled a traffic stop last June was shown to the jury at the former East Pittsburgh police officer's trial. Rosfeld is circled, left, and Rose is circled, right\n\nRose was the passenger in an unregistered taxi when the vehicle was pulled over because it resembled one that had been involved in a shooting moments earlier.\n\nRosfeld claimed he thought the teen was going to shoot him\n\nAs Rosfeld handcuffed the driver, Rose and another passenger attempted to flee.\n\nHe was shot three times - in the face, elbow and back.\n\nRosfeld claimed that he thought the teenager was reaching for a gun and that he feared for his life.\n\nHe was charged with homicide which meant the jury could have convicted him of manslaughter or murder but he was cleared on all charges.\n\nThe decision sparked protests outside the courthouse on the day it was announced.\n\nRosfeld no longer works for the police department.", "description": "Rose was shot and killed in June 2018 after running from his car when officer East Pittsburgh police officer Michael Rosfeld pulled him over.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/15/20383900-0-image-a-20_1572451146401.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
