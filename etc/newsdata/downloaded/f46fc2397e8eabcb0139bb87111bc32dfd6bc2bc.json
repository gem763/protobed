I was pleasantly surprised by how much there is to see and do on the lovely island of Anguilla. From bar hopping in Sandy Ground, to beach picnics and seafood feasts, there's no shortage of adventures.\n\nBy far my favorite activity in Anguilla (or any island for that matter!) was a sunset sail on The Tradition. This is a perfect activity for you and your girlfriends because the boat caters to small groups. Our charter had about ten people and it really made for a unique and intimate experience.\n\nThe evening kicks off with a champagne cocktail toast, followed by delicious wines and beer. After sunset, Laurie and Deb set up a delicious spread of local foods. Honestly, this might have been the best meal I had in Anguilla, and I left completely stuffed.\n\nBesides my fabulous \"I'm the king of the world\" moment, I loved when Laurie sailed us close to the caves where we could spot local wildlife. When the sun went down, he pointed out different constellations in the sky. I casually mentioned that I was a Scorpio and he must have remembered because a few minutes later, he pointed out my star sign.\n\nAll in all, this was probably one of the most magical experiences I've had, and we all know I love to find magic in everyday life.", "description": "Soak up the sun, munch on seafood, and lounge on the famous beaches of Anguilla \u2014 it's only a 15-minute boat ride from St. Maarten.", "authors": ["Megan Eileen Mcdonough", "Bohemian Trails"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d83d42e2e22af351826ebc3-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
