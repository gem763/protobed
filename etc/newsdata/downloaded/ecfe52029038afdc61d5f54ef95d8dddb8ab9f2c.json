These individual mini pecan cakes served with a poached pear are the perfect example: simple, comforting and tasty. Can\u2019t complain.\n\nPoached pear and pecan minis\n\nIf you don\u2019t have any small tins, bake the cake in a 28 x 35cm baking tray. When the pears are poached, slice them into thin pieces and scatter over the sponge. Whip the cream to soft peaks and serve alongside the cake.\n\nPrep 40 min\n\nCook 1 hr\n\nServes 4\n\nFor the cake\n\n4 eggs\n\n250ml vegetable oil\n\n300g pumpkin puree\n\n250g self-raising flour\n\n2 tsp ground mixed spice\n\n1 tsp ground cinnamon\n\n\u00bd tsp grated nutmeg\n\n1 tsp bicarbonate of soda\n\n250g light muscovado sugar\n\n100g pecans, chopped\n\n100g raisins\n\nFor the pears\n\n600g golden caster sugar\n\n1 cinnamon stick\n\n4 strips lemon peel\n\n3 cloves\n\n1 vanilla pod, split lengthways\n\n2-3cm fresh ginger, peeled and sliced\n\n4 ripe pears, peeled\n\nFor the cream\n\n200ml double cream\n\n2 tbsp maple syrup\n\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n\nLiam Charles\u2019 recipe for chocolate honey and raspberry bites | The Sweet Spot Read more\n\nHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and grease and line four deep, 10cm round cake tins with baking paper.\n\nWhisk the eggs in a large bowl, add the vegetable oil, whisk, then add the pumpkin puree and whisk again. Sift the flour, spices and bicarbonate of soda into a separate bowl, add the sugar and stir.\n\nAdd the dry mix to the wet, whisk until incorporated, then fold in the nuts and raisins. Divide the mix between the tins and bake for 30 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Transfer the cakes to a wire rack to cool. Once cooled, flip them out and set aside.\n\nFor the poached pears, put all the ingredients apart from the pears in a pan just big enough to hold the pears upright. Half fill the pan with water, bring to a gentle boil and simmer for 10 minutes to allow the flavours to infuse. Drop the pears into the pan, cover and gently poach for 20 minutes, or until soft. Turn off the heat and set aside \u2013 don\u2019t discard the syrupy water.\n\nMix the cream, maple syrup, vanilla and three tablespoons of the syrupy water in a bowl, then put in the fridge until ready to use.\n\nTo assemble the cakes, use a cookie cutter to make a 1.5cm-deep circular hole in the centre of each cake, then, with a spoon, remove enough cake for a pear to sit comfortably and proudly. Put each cake on a serving plate, carefully put a pear in the centre hole of each one, then pour the cream over the top and serve.", "description": "With the nights drawing in, we turn to comfort food.
