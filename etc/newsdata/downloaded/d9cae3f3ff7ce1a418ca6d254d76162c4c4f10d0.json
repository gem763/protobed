If it passes, the vote on whether to hold an election will follow.\n\nBut unless two thirds of MPs back the move for an election it cannot be called - which looks unlikely, given Labour's opposition.\n\nWednesday in the Commons will also see Chancellor Sajid Javid outline the government's spending plans, with the health service, education and the police expected to fare well.\n\nSpeaking late on Tuesday to a packed House of Commons, the prime minister said the MPs' bill would \"hand control\" of Brexit negotiations to the EU and bring \"more dither, more delay, more confusion\".\n\nHe told MPs he had no choice but to press ahead with efforts to call an October election, adding: \"The people of this country will have to choose.\"\n\nThe BBC understands the government wants to hold an election on 15 October, two days before a crucial EU summit in Brussels. This is a day later than the BBC was previously reporting.\n\nMr Johnson has tabled a motion in Parliament seeking approval for an \"early general election\" but has not specified a date.\n\nLabour has said the bill taking the no-deal option completely \"off the table\" needs to be passed before his party would support the call for a general election.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jeremy Corbyn: 'Get the bill through to take no deal off the table'\n\nShadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer told BBC Radio 4's Today that Labour wanted a general election but \"on its terms not Boris Johnson's terms\".\n\nHe said the party did not \"trust\" the PM to hold the election before the Brexit deadline - as he has insisted he will - suggesting Downing Street had \"lied\" last month when it denied reports that it planned to suspend Parliament.\n\n\"We are not shy of a general election but we are not going to be trapped into abandoning control of Parliament or be taken in what Boris Johnson says because we don't trust him.\"\n\nUnder the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, a prime minister must have the backing of at least two-thirds of the UK's 650 MPs before a general election can be called outside of the fixed five-year terms.\n\nDowning Street said the 21 Tory MPs who rebelled in Tuesday's vote would have the whip removed, effectively expelling them from the parliamentary party and meaning they could not stand as Conservative candidates in the election.\n\nThe rebels include several senior Conservatives including ex-chancellor Ken Clarke - a Commons veteran of nearly five decades - who said he did not recognise his party anymore.\n\n\"It's the Brexit Party, rebadged,\" he told BBC Two's Newsnight programme.\n\nThe \"knockabout character\" of the prime minister had \"the most right-wing cabinet a Conservative government has ever produced\", he said.\n\nAlso among the other jettisoned rebels are Philip Hammond who - until 24 July - served as chancellor, former justice secretary David Gauke, Winston Churchill's grandson Sir Nicholas Soames, and Rory Stewart, who recently stood against Boris Johnson to be the party leader.\n\nThe former international development secretary told the Today programme he was sacked by text message, as he was being given the GQ magazine award for politician of the year.\n\n\"It was a pretty astonishing moment,\" he said. \"It feels a little bit like something you associate with other countries - one opposes the leader, one loses the leadership race, no longer in the cabinet and now apparently thrown out of the party and one's seat too.\"\n\nMr Stewart said the decision on who should be a Conservative candidate should rest with local associations, not be made centrally. \"This is not a Conservative way of behaving,\" he added.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser to view this interactive Did your MP vote in favour of allowing the government to suspend Parliament in order to secure Brexit on 30 October?
