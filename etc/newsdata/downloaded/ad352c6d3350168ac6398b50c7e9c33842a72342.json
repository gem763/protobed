Head of commerce Daniel Greenberg, 22, tells Yahoo Lifestyle that an August brainstorm meeting on brand partnerships, including one between Adidas-Arizona, produced the winning idea.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What would a collab look like with Jesus Christ?\u201d Greenberg tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cYou could say Jesus is the most influential person of all time.\u201d\n\nThe premium price may not faze true sneaker fans \u2014 Bergdorf Goodman sells Jimmy Choo \u201cDiamond Crystal-Embellished Metallic Sneakers\u201d for $3,995, and Dior is selling high-top sneakers for $1,100.\n\nMSCHF employees pitched different shoe concepts \u2014 sneakers with a holy nail and fake blood and a modern upgrade on the classic \u201cJandal\u201d (Jesus sandal) trend. But the idea of \u201cwalking on water\u201d won out. \u201cWe weren\u2019t making a religious statement, but more saying, \u2018Hey, collab culture is getting out of hand,\u2019\u201d says Greenberg.\n\nThe team decided to use Air Max 97s, Greenberg\u2019s daily shoe (although the product has no association with Nike), and inject holy water into the midsole, the cushioned part of a sneaker. But engineering required innovation. Fortunately, Greenberg has a friend living in Israel, who agreed to retrieve one gallon of water from the Jordan River \u2014 where, per Christian tradition, Jesus was baptized \u2014 and ship it to New York.\n\nWalk on water while blessing your kick game with the exclusive all white Nike Air Max 97 MSCHF x INRI Jesus Shoes.\n\n\n\nShop the sneakers on StockX: https://t.co/ulGquMQIPm pic.twitter.com/npejhQ3Lrs \u2014 StockX Sneakers (@StockXSneakers) October 8, 2019\n\nGreenberg and his colleagues also called a priest to the office to bless the water. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have any issue with it, but sort of laughed at our weird request,\u201d he says. The water was mixed with blue dye for realism and red soles to reflect the shoe color worn by the Pope. The inserts are also scented with the resin frankincense, one of three gifts presented to baby Jesus.\n\nAnd the ungodly price? It\u2019s a play on Matthew 14:25, which describes Jesus walking on water. (The shoes are also available on retail site Stock X for around $3,000).\n\nThe completed product was sent to a handful of Instagram influencers and rapper A$AP Rocky, but Greenberg believes they went viral due to \u201csneaker heads\u201d obsessively following the product tease online. The shoes went on sale at 11 a.m. on Tuesday and all two dozen pairs were sold out by 11:01 a.m.\n\nGreenberg, who dropped out of college after his freshmen year and is now studying two days a week at New York University while working full-time at MSCHF, tells Yahoo Lifestyle while rushing to class, \u201cWe\u2019re not a shoe company and we did not believe many would buy these or pay freaking $1,425.\u201d\n\nNow MSCHF, which Greenberg says is \u201cthe anti, anti company,\u201d plans to introduce new concepts on every second and fourth Tuesday. When pressed for details, he teased, \u201can app, a weird exponential thing about streaming wars, and weed paraphernalia.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "The fast-selling shoes are inspired by Jesus, \"the most influential person of all time,\" noted a company rep.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/L7.Pvo1YOt6g4dcNeLrebQ--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/9b890db0-eb8c-11e9-a5b8-1015dc8b1220", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
