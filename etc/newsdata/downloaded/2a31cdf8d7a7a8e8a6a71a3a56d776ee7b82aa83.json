(Picture: EPA)\n\nGlastonbury\u2019s 50th anniversary festival will take place at Worthy Farm from 24-28 June.\n\nThe first batch of tickets for the festival, which included coach travel to the event, went on sale on Thursday and sold out in less than half an hour, before the general admission tickets went on sale on Sunday morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the festival may be turning 50 in 2020, it only took place intermittently throughout the 70s before becoming an annual event in 1981.\n\nSince then it has taken place most years although takes a break every few years to allow the ground to recover from being trampled on by all those revellers.\n\nWho is rumoured to be headlining Glastonbury 2020?\n\nWill we be seeing Paul McCartney take to the Glastonbury stage in 2020? (Picture:Pierre Suu/Getty Images)\n\nNo acts have yet been announced for the 2020 festival \u2013 although that hasn\u2019t stopped the rumour mill from churning out a few suggestions.\n\nAccording to the bookies Paul McCartney is the odds-on favourite to nab one of those coveted Pyramid Stage slots, with Coral offering odds of just 1-2 on the former Beatle appearing.\n\n\u2018It will be the 50th anniversary on Glastonbury next year so it is easy to see why punters feel as though organisers will turn to Paul McCartney to headline on the Pyramid Stage in what is sure to be a star-studded line-up,\u2019 said Coral\u2019s John Hill.\n\nTaylor Swift is also tipped to be in with a shot (Picture: Rex Shutterstock)\n\nHowever he\u2019s not the only name in the frame, with Taylor Swift currently evens to take to the Pyramid Stage \u2013 while Madonna is strongly fancied at 2-1 and Fleetwood Mac, who have long tipped for a headline spot at the festival, are currently 4-1.\n\n\u2018Taylor Swift is also odds-on to perform at Glastonbury next year and judging by her schedule for 2020, she would be available for those dates, while we have also seen strong money for music royalty in Madonna,\u2019 Hill added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ll find out in due course if the bookies were right\u2026\n\nGot a showbiz story?
