Negotiators are due back at the bargaining table this morning. UAW officials say the talks have reached the \"main table\", meaning top negotiators are trying to hammer out a deal. Nearly 50,000 GM workers are on strike.\n\nFacebook (FB) confirmed that it is developing augmented reality glasses as well as a project called Live Maps that will create 3-D maps of the world. The maps project has been in development for some time, but it's gaining attention now following Facebook's acquisition of Control Labs, a startup that's developing software to measure neuron activity in the brain.\n\nSam\u2019s Club (WMT) is making a push into health care. The Walmart-owned retail chain is teaming up with health care companies to offer discounts to customers. Starting in October, members in select states will be able to buy health care service bundles ranging from $50 dollars for individuals to $240 dollars for families of up to six people.\n\nMore problems for the troubled retailer Game Stop (GME). Sony (SNE) just launched its own store, where you can purchase games, gaming consoles, and accessories directly. Playstation plus members will have access to free one-day shipping from the store, and Sony is offering two subscription bundles for Playstation 4 and Playstation 4 Pro.\n\nVerizon's (VZ) 5G network is set to launch in parts of New York City today. The service will reach areas of uptown, midtown, and downtown Manhattan, along with select parts of Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Queens. With the NYC rollout included, the 5G service is now available in 11 cities. Verizon is the parent company of Yahoo Finance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "General Motors, Facebook, Sam\u2019s Club, Sony and Verizon are the companies to watch.", "authors": ["Yahoo Finance"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/a3t_YhH4cH6F5Hbcts3wog--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/31db8d40-e06d-11e9-ae7e-12b8da60161c", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
