Within three months of first going on sale in 2016, they\u2019d become the number one wireless headphones in the world. Within a year, they became the number one headphones of any kind.\n\nHopes are high for the new model.\n\nFirst of all, they\u2019re not called AirPods 3, just because they\u2019re the third iteration. Just as the iPhone 11 was accompanied by the iPhone 11 Pro, so the new headphones sit alongside the existing second-generation AirPods as the top-end part of the range.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAirPods Pro have a completely new design, though they\u2019re immediately recognisable as AirPods with the same gloss white finish and stem that points down towards your mouth. But that stem is noticeably shorter this time and has a more solid look to it.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Although tales of AirPods falling out of ears were few \u2013 simply mislaying the tiny gadget was much more common \u2013 the new design feels comfortingly safe.\n\nThe new AirPods are also water- and sweat-resistant. That doesn\u2019t mean they can survive being submerged and you definitely shouldn\u2019t swim in them. The Ingress Protection rating is IPX4 which means \u201cProtected against water sprayed from all directions \u2013 limited ingress permitted\u201d. In other words, great for working out or suitable for wearing in the rain.\n\nOne big new part of the design is the silicone ear tip, meant to be the first way to create strong audio by ensuring there\u2019s a decent seal to keep the outside world out and the music in.\n\nTypically, Apple has included its own way of ensuring the perfect fit. Three sets of silicone ear tips are included in the box. The medium ear tip is in place. Once you\u2019ve put the AirPods Pro into your ears, the Ear Tip Fit Test on the iPhone awaits: music is played and the inward-facing microphone can tell if there\u2019s a decent seal or not.\n\nIf it decides there isn\u2019t, the test advises you to adjust the AirPod or try a new ear tip. Apple has devised a clever system that keeps the silicone tips solidly in place while still making them easy to swap.\n\nThe tight seal means the audio quality is already better than on previous AirPods but the big new feature on AirPods Pro is also audio-related: active noise cancellation.\n\nI\u2019ve been trying this feature more or less continuously and I might as well tell you now, it\u2019s fantastic.\n\nAs with other active noise cancellation features, it works by using a microphone that listens to the world outside and creating a noise which is reversed in phase to cancel out the external noise.\n\nSome other in-ear headphones have this, such as the upcoming Huawei Freebuds 3 and the widely-and-justly applauded Sony WF-1000XM3.\n\nApple\u2019s noise cancellation is very skilfully done, and highly effective. Turning on noise cancellation in a crowded room is almost like watching a movie dream sequence where the voices of people around you smoothly but swiftly fade away.\n\nIn some headphones, noise cancellation can affect the audio quality of the music you\u2019re playing. I haven\u2019t found that to be the case here.\n\nWith regular AirPods, and these too, removing one bud from your ear pauses the music, and putting it back starts it up again. It\u2019s the natural way to respond if someone comes to speak to you.\n\nThat feature is here, too, but there\u2019s also another way to hear the outside world. It\u2019s called Transparency Mode and it means the music still plays but you can hear your voice and that of the person you\u2019re talking to. In other words, it overcomes the noise-isolating seal to make your voice sound as it would if you weren\u2019t wearing headphones.\n\nBattery life on AirPods Pro is the same as on the previous version, that is five hours. Unless you have either noise-cancellation or Transparency turned on, which reduces the charge to four hours 30 minutes. There\u2019s another 19 hours of charge in the case, again as before.\n\nOh, and by the way, although this is a Pro model, it doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s a USB-C connector on the charging case. Like previous AirPods and like the current iPhone 11 Pro, the AirPods Pro use a Lightning connector.\n\nWhat is different from previous AirPods is the cable that\u2019s supplied - here it\u2019s a Lightning to USB-C cable, not USB-A as previously.\n\nBecause of the silicone ear tips, the mechanism for changing tracks used on previous AirPods \u2013 a vigorous tap on the AirPod stem \u2013 isn\u2019t quite so comfortable.\n\nSo, the stem on the AirPod Pro has a flat capacitive touch panel, called a force sensor which, when you press and hold it, switches between Noise-Cancelling and Transparency mode. I found the easiest way to activate this was to squeeze the AirPod stem from both sides.\n\nA shorter touch is used to pause tracks or answer calls, repeated touches change to next or previous songs. It\u2019s a different interaction but easy to get used to.\n\nAlthough the new AirPods Pro buds are slightly heavier than before, they don\u2019t feel it and the bigger case is still highly pocketable and light.\n\nThe audio quality isn\u2019t the only element with AirPods Pro, though it\u2019s obviously the most important. When you pair any pair of wireless headphones with an iPhone, the set-up and usage is important. To pair the AirPods Pro you simply open the case next to your iPhone and it\u2019s done. It makes using AirPods a seamless experience.\n\nAirPods Pro are more expensive than regular AirPods which cost \u00a3159, or \u00a3199 if you opt for the model with a wireless-chargeable case. So, there\u2019s a \u00a350 premium for AirPods Pro which cost \u00a3249. This is a higher price than rival noise-cancelling in-ears from Sony and Huawei.\n\nIs it worth the money? I\u2019d say yes, just for the jaw-droppingly good audio you get with noise-cancelling turned on. Add in the smooth user experience, the excellent, comfortable fit and the cute design, and AirPods Pro become a compelling prospect.", "description": "Apple AirPods have certainly been a success.
