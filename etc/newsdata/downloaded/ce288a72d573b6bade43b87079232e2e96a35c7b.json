The agency asserts, however, that the court can solve the problem by simply striking down the \u201cfor-cause\u201d removal limitation, but otherwise preserving the agency.\n\nIt may not get its way. The court is at least considering whether to invalidate the entire agency.\n\nIn its order accepting the case, the court asked the parties to answer this question: If the for-cause removal requirement is unconstitutional, can it be severed from the rest of the statute that created the bureau? If it can\u2019t be severed, then the court might invalidate the entire agency.\n\nNotably, in his D.C. Circuit dissent, Kavanaugh wrote that he believed the for-cause requirement could be struck down while preserving the rest of the agency. Whether he retains that opinion and whether his eight colleagues agree remain to be seen.\n\nThe case is important because it presents an opportunity for the court to defend the separation of powers. The court notably missed another opportunity to do so last term in Gundy v. United States, when it upheld a broad delegation of law-writing authority from Congress to the attorney general.\n\nIt should not miss another opportunity, particularly where, as in this case, even the agency itself concedes that its structure violates the Constitution.\n\nThe case also affords the court the opportunity to correct the damage caused by the bureau\u2019s unconstitutional structure.\n\nAs The Heritage Foundation has discussed at length here, and then-law professor Neomi Rao, now a federal judge herself, testified here, the unconstitutional structure of the bureau has led to abuses of its power that have caused economic harm and undermined the rule of law.\n\nAt the very least, therefore, the court should invalidate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s decisions of the past nine years because they\u2019re products of an unconstitutional agency.\n\nIn the meantime, however, the court should not miss this opportunity to tell Congress that when the Constitution says the legislative, executive, and judicial powers shall be separate, it really means it.", "description": "The Supreme Court\u00a0agreed Oct. 18 to hear a case\u00a0challenging the constitutionality of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\u00a0\n\nThe court will decide whether, by sharply curtailing the president\u2019s ability to remove the head of this executive branch agency, Congress violated the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers.", "authors": ["Giancarlo Canaparo", "Legal Fellow", "Giancarlo Is A Legal Fellow At The Heritage Foundation."], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-10/GettyImages-1024946970.jpg?itok=zNbu7gJC", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
