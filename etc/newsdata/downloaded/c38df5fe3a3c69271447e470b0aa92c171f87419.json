In Dunkirk, the 32-year-old actor played a French guy who was pretending to be an English guy, which necessitated a mostly silent performance. In Starz\u2019s The White Queen, he played Richard III with an arch tone we might call Period-Piece Pronunciation. Now, in The Goldfinch, Barnard plays Boris, a shady Ukrainian globetrotter who reconnects with Ansel Elgort\u2019s Theo many years after their youthful misadventures in Las Vegas. It\u2019s a performance full of big choices, so it\u2019s all the more surprising that in real life Barnard turns out to be a soft-spoken, slightly self-effacing Welshman. He proceeds through his sentences carefully, in seven- or eight-word bursts, and after a decade in the business, his voice retains the musical lilt of the Valleys. Listening to him talk feels a bit like being cradled in a soft woolen blanket.\n\nWe\u2019re both in Toronto for The Goldfinch\u2019s premiere at TIFF, where its Oscar hopes will die a quick, painless death. But as luck would have it, John Crowley\u2019s critically savaged drama is just one of three films Barnard has at this year\u2019s festival. Besides Boris, the actor also pops up as smug posho James Steerforth in Armando Ianucci\u2019s David Copperfield adaptation, and as tightly strung physicist Paul Langevin in Marjane Satrapi\u2019s Marie Curie biopic, Radioactive. (The latter premiered to a fairly muted reaction, but people at TIFF seemed to like Copperfield.) It\u2019s a lot of worldly Europeans, a thrilling transformation for a kid from \u201cthe middle of nowhere, an old coal-mining valley where the coal mines have been closed since the 1980s.\u201d Unlike many British actors, Barnard has working-class roots; his father was a miner and his mother worked in a factory. What is it like to play all these buttoned-up aristocrats? \u201cIt\u2019s good fun,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cYou have to find the human being, within all the seriousness.\u201d\n\nAs this interview is taking place in a world where there is still optimism around The Goldfinch, the plan is to do a short Q&A at the city\u2019s famed Ben McNally Books, where Donna Tartt\u2019s novel is prominently on display, then peruse the shelves to see if anything strikes our fancy. This is a better idea in theory than in practice, where it mostly results in the two of us wandering quietly around the shop and occasionally remarking on a title. \u201cWhat to Wear When Surviving a Lion Attack?\u201d Barnard says, noticing one slim volume. \u201cProbably something very comfortable that you want to die in.\u201d He flips through it. \u201cI think it\u2019s full of poems.\u201d (It is.)\n\nAneurin Barnard (center) with Harry Styles and Fionn Whitehead in Dunkirk.

Pictures\n\nBarnard calls himself \u201can overthinker\u201d when it comes to books: \u201cI don\u2019t want to invest so much time in a bad book.\u201d He was an undiagnosed dyslexic as a child and preferred to watch movies, where he was entranced by those hell-raising old actors: Richard Burton, Richard Harris, Oliver Reed, Peter O\u2019 Toole. When it does come time to crack open a book now he prefers nonfiction, especially big \u201cprovocative\u201d books like Yuval Noah Harari\u2019s Sapiens, which his wife is reading, or anything that makes him \u201cquestion reality.\u201d Biographies are a special favorite, as they\u2019re full of \u201cstuff I steal to use in characters.\u201d He particularly enjoyed Patti Smith\u2019s Just Kids, and always finds himself rereading Burton\u2019s diaries.\n\nJust like Burton, Barnard says he never wants to play the same kind of role twice. In the three projects premiering at TIFF, he got the chance to work with three very different directors. \u201cJohn is very good at understanding emotional baggage, and discovering it just enough for the audience to feel like they get it, and then he takes it away,\u201d he says. \u201cArmando, with his own body language, is able to make you improvise the line that he was looking for, and he hasn\u2019t said a thing. Marjane\u2019s mind is like a grandfather clock: There\u2019s all these ideas moving, and everything has to work with precision. Many of us probably wouldn\u2019t be able to understand it, but the product that you see is bang-on time.\u201d\n\nSomebody\u2019s gonna find out that I\u2019m a fraud or a fake, or say, \u2018By the way, you\u2019ve not deserved any of this.\u2019\n\nWe pass through the History section, which Barnard jokes that he has plenty of experience with. In person the actor has a gentleness to him, but on film his face takes on a gloomy, angular quality; one of the lessons he learned in drama school was how to harness what he calls his \u201cdarkness.\u201d Add in the fact that he has the hair, eyes, and cheekbones of a Romantic poet, and it means that Barnard has spent a significant portion of his career brooding in historical dress. He was a \u201970s dreamboat in Hunky Dory, a dissolute Darnley in a 2013 Mary Queen of Scots, and in the role that gave him his breakout, a wild-eyed Melchior in the West End production of Spring Awakening. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that we\u2019re any different now than we were 400 years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cWe show emotions in different ways; that\u2019s the exciting thing about different periods. But the relationships between people, the manipulation between people, it\u2019s always been the same.\u201d Still, there are definite benefits to projects like The Goldfinch that are set in the present. \u201cWhen you\u2019re filming for 15 hours a day and you\u2019ve got leather, chainmail, and plate armor on, sometimes you just want to wear some sweatpants and a vest.\u201d\n\nOne of those historical projects was the BBC\u2019s War and Peace, where Barnard played the shameless striver Boris Drubetskoy. (\u201cMy first Boris.\u201d) In the shop, a book with a photo of Tolstoy on the cover catches his interest. He picks it up and reads the summary: vlogger \u2026 obscure amateur web series. \u201cThat\u2019s nowhere near Tolstoy,\u201d he mutters. It appears we\u2019ve accidentally wandered into the YA section. We escape into Business, which might be even worse; of Bitcoin Billionaires, he notes, \u201cThat would be a book would probably make me fall asleep.\u201d It\u2019s around here that we give up the pretense of shopping for books.\n\nAt the beginning of our interview, I asked Barnard about Wales. You have to start, he said, with \u201cthe huge amount of passionate people who live there, who are incredibly charismatic and loyal to the bone. Most of them work very, very hard for very little in return, and that creates a very strong affiliation between people and community.\u201d Like a lot of people who\u2019ve left those kinds of communities and found their way into elite spaces, he has a nagging fear that he\u2019ll soon be unmasked as an imposter: \u201cSomebody\u2019s gonna find out that I\u2019m a fraud or a fake, or say, \u2018By the way, you\u2019ve not deserved any of this.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s an uncomfortable feeling, but he reckons that it\u2019s better than the alternative. \u201cThe moment I think that I\u2019m the best that I can be is probably the day I should give up. \u2019Cause my ego\u2019s obviously taken a turn for the worse.\u201d", "description": "With three different projects premiering at TIFF 2019, you\u2019re going to be seeing a lot of Aneurin Barnard soon.", "authors": ["Nate Jones"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/18/18-aneurin-barnard-1.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
