REUTERS/Ivan Alvarado\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) has become the leading provider of data storage in just a few years, raising concerns in Europe that the group could let U.S. intelligence agencies access corporate data under the U.S CLOUD Act of 2018.\n\n\u201cAWS is a soft drug. The more you take it, the more you like it, so ... weaning yourself off it seems complicated to me,\u201d French junior economy minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher told Reuters, pointing out its global reach and affordable prices.\n\nA spokeswoman for AWS had no immediate comment to make on the minister\u2019s comments when contacted by Reuters.\n\nAWS says on its website that it is aware that its customers \u201ccare deeply about privacy and data security\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe also implement responsible and sophisticated technical and physical controls that are designed to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of (customer\u2019s) content,\u201d AWS adds.\n\nAWS is tapping into the fast-growing migration of data from in-house servers to external data centers and now controls a third of the global market, Synergy Research group says.\n\nIt is followed by Microsoft (MSFT.O) with 16% of the market and Alphabet\u2019s Google (GOOGL.O) with 7.8%.\n\nSOVEREIGN CLOUD\n\nPrevious French government-supported attempts to build a so-called \u201csovereign\u201d cloud to store the most sensitive data held by companies and states failed.\n\nPannier-Runacher, a former executive at auto equipment maker Faurecia (EPED.PA), said that Amazon\u2019s potential market dominance could eventually push it to increase its prices.\n\nAnd time is running out to come up with a proper alternative solution to safeguard companies\u2019 margins and Europe\u2019s control over its data, Pannier-Runacher said.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m telling my European friends is that if in 24 months\u2019 time we\u2019re not able find alternatives, there\u2019s real risk of a loss of sovereignty,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis is what I\u2019m hearing from experts, including French people in Silicon Valley, who underline how worrisome this situation is.\u201d\n\nFinance Minister Bruno Le Maire this year enlisted French tech companies Dassault Systemes (DAST.PA) and OVH to come up with plans to break the dominance of U.S. cloud computing.\n\nTwo consortia, one led by French telecoms group and former monopoly Orange (ORAN.PA), the other by rival SFR (ATCA.AS), tried to develop an alternative to U.S. services at a total investment cost of 450 million euros.\n\nBut they did not gain any significant ground and Orange\u2019s solution is poised to cease activity by the end of January 2020.\n\nThe migration of data shows no sign of abating, however, with worldwide spending on public cloud services and infrastructure forecast to more than double by 2023 to $500 billion, market research firm IDC says.", "description": "Amazon's cloud computing is like a \"soft drug\", a French minister said on Tuesday, warning that time was running out for Europe to wean itself off the U.S. company's services.", "authors": ["Mathieu Rosemain", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441167433&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1GX", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
