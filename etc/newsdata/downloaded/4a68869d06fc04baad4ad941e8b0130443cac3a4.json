Some measures have been scaled back but a security lockdown is still largely in place and broadband and mobile internet connections remain unavailable to most Kashmiris.\n\n'Lost freedom'\n\nSchools and colleges are empty and most shops, restaurants and hotels shut.\n\nHundreds of people, including mainstream political leaders and separatists fighting for Kashmir's secession from India, remain in custody for fear that they could whip up mass protests that have in the past turned violent.\n\nWajahat Habibullah, a former bureaucrat who served in Kashmir and travelled to the region's main city last month, said Kashmiris felt humiliated to lose their statehood.\n\n\"Whatever the attitude of [federal] governments in the past, they at least felt they had something of their own. Now, there is a kind of feeling of having lost whatever freedom they had,\" he said.\n\nOfficials said on Tuesday that suspected rebels fighting Indian rule in Kashmir shot dead five construction workers who had come to work from eastern India.\n\nTruckers involved in the apple trade were targeted earlier in the month.\n\nCrowds have also been gathering this week in the streets of Srinagar, the biggest city in Kashmir, and elsewhere, throwing stones at security forces in protest against the continuing clampdown.\n\nNew territories\n\nOn Thursday, G C Murmu, a former bureaucrat from Modi's home state of Gujarat, will be sworn in as the first lieutenant governor of the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, the government said.\n\nAnother former civil servant, Radha Krishna Mathur, will take office as the lieutenant governor of Ladakh where the Modi administration is hoping to ramp up tourism and infrastructure investment.\n\nLadakh is known for its snow-capped peaks and rocky desert plateaus, and is also an area of dispute with China which lays claims to parts of it.\n\nWithin the Hindu-dominated Jammu region, there are expectations that the takeover by the federal government will lead to development and shift the focus away from the Kashmir valley, where the insurgency is centred.\n\n\"There are three parts to this story, Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh. The problem is confined to Kashmir and that too a handful of districts. Why should the rest of the state suffer,\" said a top official in New Delhi involved in the political strategy to deal with Kashmir.", "description": "India will formally split up Jammu and Kashmir state into two federal territories to be directly ruled from New Delhi.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/30/c1c28242143549deaadba3675a40a16d_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
