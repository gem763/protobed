I hope and pray he won\u2019t want to cause another government shutdown because it might be a diversion away from impeachment.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have insisted the government will not shut down, but that was also their position in December when Trump kicked off the longest government shutdown in history over Democrats\u2019 refusal to fund his border wall.
