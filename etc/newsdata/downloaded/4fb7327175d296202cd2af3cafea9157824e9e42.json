I did by repeatedly stabbing her in the face and throat.\"\n\nFarrell, who denies murder, started a relationship with his victim after she became a regular visitor to his flat for drugs, the court was told.\n\nMr Jones said Farrell knocked at a neighbour's window on April 23, saying: \"I killed her.\"\n\nA friend of the neighbour went with six-foot-tall Farrell to his flat in Carlton Terrace in the Mount Pleasant area of Swansea.\n\n(Image: WALES NEWS SERVICE)\n\nThere, he saw the body of Ms Lodwig, who was 5ft 1ins and weighed six stone, on a bed.\n\nFarrell fled after the emergency services were alerted and paramedics found his girlfriend fully-clothed, with cuts across her throat and forehead and \"severe bleeding\" on the bedding.\n\nIt was estimated that Ms Lodwig died 20 or 30 minutes before they arrived.\n\nA black-handled kitchen knife covered in blood, with the tip of its 15cm blade missing, was found next to the bed.\n\n(Image: WALES NEWS SERVICE)\n\nForensic scientist Claire Morse said it appeared the woman had been assaulted while on the bed.\n\nMr Jones also said knotted and blood-stained dressing gown belts with traces of Ms Lodwig's saliva were found nearby, suggesting they may have been in or around her mouth.\n\nInjuries to her neck damaged major arteries and veins, while wounds to her chest were deep enough to enter both her lungs.\n\nThe cause of death was established as stab wounds to her neck and chest.\n\nThe court heard that later that morning Farrell phoned a friend, telling her: \"I've killed her. I had enough. She wouldn't shut up. I sliced her up,\" adding that it had been a \"slow death\".\n\n(Image: WALES NEWS SERVICE)\n\n(Image: WALES NEWS SERVICE)\n\nFirearms officers tracked him down to an address near his flat that afternoon.\n\nThey persuaded him to put down a knife he was holding to his neck before arresting him.\n\nWhile in custody, he said in front of officers that Ms Lodwig \"didn't deserve to die like that\", the court heard.\n\nFarrell also wrote a letter confessing to the killing, the court heard.\n\nMr Jones told the jury: \"That letter confessed to murder of Sammy-Lee. He'd actually used the word 'murdered'. We say it's a chilling document and one you will be able to see and read for yourself.\"\n\nThe prosecutor added the defendant was also accused of a \"brutal attack\" on Mr Maher just days before the alleged murder.\n\nFarrell denies murder, wounding with intent and unlawful wounding.\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Jason Farrell, from Swansea, south Wales, started a relationship with Sammy-Lee Lodwig after she became a regular visitor to his flat for drugs, the court heard - he had previously dated her mum", "authors": ["Chiara Fiorillo", "Image", "Media Wales", "Wales News Service"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20586108.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MEDIA-WALES-Sammy-Lee-Lodwig-01.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
