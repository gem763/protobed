I\u2019m not that way inclined.\u201d\n\nWilliam Mousley QC, prosecuting, asked the defendant whether he had embellished or invented elements of his account to portray his innocence, saying: \u201cYou are just making it up as you go along, Mr Gascoigne, aren\u2019t you?\n\n\u201cYou did not say anything like that when you were interviewed by the police, did you?\u201d\n\nGascoigne denied that he had lied.\n\nHe denied trying to embarrass or humiliate the woman, whom he estimated to be around 20 years younger than him, replying: \u201cShe had already been humiliated.\u201d", "description": "The former England star denies any sexual intent when he kissed a female passenger on a train.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/13/wire-19739480-1571141926-429_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
