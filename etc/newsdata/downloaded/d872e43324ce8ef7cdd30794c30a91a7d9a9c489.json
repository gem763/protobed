But maybe we have woken up a bit.\u201d\n\nWith its long tradition of fishing for salmon, herring and perch, several areas off Finland\u2019s west coast were identified after months of research and testing as likely ghost net problem zones.\n\nTwo fishing boats were equipped to drag the seabed using weighted-down hooks \u201cdesigned to be as soft as possible\u201d on the seafloor, Kotilainen says.\n\n\u2013 Dragging zone \u2013\n\nOut at sea, the red and white trawler Kalkas rocks heavily in the Baltic wind.\n\nOnce it reaches the day\u2019s dragging site about half an hour from Reposaari harbour, it slows to a halt.\n\nThe crew starts the winch to lower the dragging equipment 14 metres (46 feet) down to the seafloor.\n\nSlowly but surely the boat covers its three-kilometre (1.9-mile) dragging zone, or \u201ctransect\u201d, then the team winches the drag back to the surface.\n\nThis time, the hooks are empty.\n\n\u201cWe have a bit more than 300 kilometres now dragged,\u201d Kotilainen says.\n\n\u201cIn about 10 percent of the transects we\u2019ve caught something.\u201d\n\nHe says that the problem of ghost nets appears to be smaller in Finnish waters than in neighbouring Sweden \u2014 the Finnish seas are frozen for longer so there\u2019s less fishing.\n\nNonetheless, the team has fished out around 1,000 metres\u2019 worth of abandoned nets so far, along with many ropes, weights and other fishing gear.\n\n\u2013 Throwing money into the sea \u2013\n\nDepending on its results, the team will recommend whether to expand the ghost net recovery.\n\nAnother of its aims is to find ways to recycle all the recovered plastic including the discarded nets, large numbers of which also litter Finland\u2019s harbour sides.\n\nMarkku Saiha, of the Finnish Fishermen\u2019s Association, says that people need to be made more aware of the impact of their lost nets.\n\n\u201cWe have to tell people that the risk is there all the time if they abandon their nets in the archipelago or on the coast,\u201d he tells AFP.\n\nNets are also a safety risk for small boats, and fishermen are losing money by discarding their nets, says Saiha.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s money. No one wants to leave money in the sea.\u201d\n\nBut, despite the dire warnings of Baltic pollution, he sees reason for optimism.\n\n\u201cThis is one starting point,\u201d Saiha says.\n\n\u201cAfter 10 years, maybe it\u2019ll be a better situation, I believe that strongly.\u201d", "description": "Reposaari (Finland) (AFP) \u2013 On a small fishing boat out in the Baltic Sea, Pekka Kotilainen rifles through buckets of fishing gear, mixed with", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/9c9865_finland-is-tackling-problem-plastic-ghost-nets-old-fishing-nets-abandoned-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
