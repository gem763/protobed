This decision will surely safeguard the lives of vulnerable youngsters of India. But, as per the ABCD Cannabis Price Index report published in September 2019, Delhi is the third largest cannabis consumer in the world, and Mumbai is the sixth. Globally, prevention and treatment of drug abuse is falling short, with just one out of seven people receiving treatment.\n\n\n\nEvery soul is, by nature, pleasure seeking, anandamayo bhyasat. But the nature of this world is bliss and it can only be had when we are established in our original nature with knowledge and meditation, knowledge to know why and how we should act, and meditation to help us act in the way we have decided to act. Knowledge is direction, and meditation provides us with determination. A study at the US based National Centre for Complementary & Integrative Health revealed that meditation helped in reducing intensity of craving for opiods by about 50%,in comparison to TAU (Treatment As Usual, using medications).\n\n\n\nDrugs seem the easiest way to forget loneliness, suffering and stress.\n\n\n\nWhat is required is a blend of education, meditation and compassion. Srila Prabhupada, founder of Iskcon, was recognised by civic agencies for easing out thousands of youngsters in the US from addiction in 1960s, through meditation and compassion. Along with meditation, one needs to have some positive engagement that will not let stray thoughts of lower desires come in the mind.These three principles of countering addiction are being presented in the youth festival, \u2018UDGAAR \u2014 An Expression of Goodness and Joy\u2019 today at the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium, New Delhi. \u25a0", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.speakingtree.in/a/748628-1350-420-5/counter-addiction.img", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
