Alabama and Clemson, both of whom were idle, continue to lead the way, and a few other results produced changes in the top 10.\n\nAlabama received 40 of 65 first-place votes this week to strengthen its hold on the No. 1 spot it grabbed a week ago. No. 2 Clemson saw its first-place total slip to 20. Georgia, which trailed Tennessee early but went on to dominate the rest of the way, stayed put at No. 3.\n\nAlabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa escapes the pocket as he looks to pass against Mississippi.

The Buckeyes received the remaining three No. 1 votes and edge ahead of No. 5 Oklahoma.\n\nLSU held at No. 6 followed by next week\u2019s opponent, No. 7 Florida. The Gators moved up a notch after taking down Auburn, which slid to No. 12. Wisconsin, Penn State and Notre Dame round out the top 10.\n\nTOP 25: Complete Amway Coaches Poll rankings\n\nWINNERS AND LOSERS: Highs and lows from Week 6\n\nSMU needed a huge rally against Tulsa to stay unbeaten, but as a result the Mustangs enter the poll at No. 22 this week. It is their first appearance in the Top 25 since USA TODAY began administering the coaches poll in 1991. Their last time in the coaches poll was 1984.\n\nNo. 23 Baylor also makes its season debut as well as No. 25 Minnesota. Also rejoining the rankings is No. 24 Arizona State.\n\nWashington, which suffered its second loss of the campaign at Stanford, falls out of the poll from the No. 16 spot. Central Florida, Michigan State and Oklahoma State are the week\u2019s other dropouts.", "description": "Ohio State moved up to No. 4 in the latest Amway Coaches Poll, flipping spots with Oklahoma.
