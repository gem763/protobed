Protest graffiti likening officers to dogs and worse is all over the city, and protesters Saturday chanted for the force to be disbanded.\n\nOverall, Saturday\u2019s rallies were lower-key and more peaceful than other far larger and more violent protests that have rocked the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. Riot police deployed but stayed far behind the day\u2019s largest rally, which drew thousands of peaceful marchers in Kowloon.\n\nPolice said rioters tossing gasoline bombs damaged a subway station, but there was no repeat of the more intense destruction and battles between protesters and police that have spread across Hong Kong.\n\nStill, restoring any semblance of trust between police officers and the 7.5 million people they are sworn to serve and protect is going to be a long, hard battle.\n\nDemonstrators widely decry the force\u2019s policing of the hundreds of protests that began in early June as thuggish, with more than 2,300 people arrested. Its liberal use of tear gas and what has become a familiar sight of officers in full riot gear pursuing young protesters and making muscular, sometimes brutish arrests has come as a shock to a city that long prided itself on being safe.\n\n\u201cThey beat the butts out of people,\u201d said the 90-year-old woman, Cheng Liang Yu, who angrily shouted at the passing police van with her 60-year-old daughter, Dorothy Lau.\n\nOne of Lau\u2019s daughters is a part-time police officer. Lau has her photo, proudly saluting in her police uniform, stored on her cellphone. But she was equally dismissive of the force her daughter serves.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re too violent,\u201d she said.\n\nTogether with another of Lau\u2019s daughters, Liz Yuen, the women joined a protest of about 200 people, many of them retirees, outside the towering police headquarters in central Hong Kong on Saturday. The peaceful rally held a minute\u2019s silence for victims of what protesters described as police abuse. Photos taped on the sidewalk showed X-rays of fractured bones that protesters alleged were broken in police custody.\n\nPatrolling discreetly in their midst, a handful of plainclothes police officers tried to break the ice. They stopped traffic to allow elderly protesters, some with walking sticks, to cross a busy road to join the sit-in rally.\n\nThey also took heated verbal abuse.\n\n\u201cThe police and the triads are brothers!\u201d yelled 75-year-old Chiu Shuitin, directing his anger directly at officers who shuffled silently away. \u201cThe police don\u2019t protect us anymore!\u201d\n\nOne of the plainclothes officers said the past few months have been tough on them, too. He said he worries that people who know he\u2019s an officer might leak that fact, along with his name and address, on the internet, so protesters can target him and his family. To lower his profile outside of work, he said he\u2019s now in touch with only a small circle of his closest friends.\n\nHe lamented that protesters who used to target officers with nothing more dangerous than paper planes now hurl bricks and gasoline bombs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very sad,\u201d said the officer, who didn\u2019t want to be identified because he wasn\u2019t authorized to give media interviews. \u201cHow can we talk?\u201d\n\nOne of the protest movement\u2019s key demands is for an independent inquiry into the policing methods deployed against protesters and widely held conspiracy theories \u2014 repeatedly and strongly denied by the police force \u2014 that detainees have died in custody.\n\nBut protesters are also pessimistic that Hong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, will bow to that or other demands, including universal suffrage. She is scheduled to deliver her annual policy address on Wednesday. If demonstrators don\u2019t turn out in force for that, it could be another hint \u2014 along with the toned-down rallies on Saturday \u2014 that the movement may be losing a little steam.\n\nA 58-year-old teacher of English and history at the protest outside the police headquarters said she\u2019d been terrified by the increase in violence this month, which included two police shootings of teen-aged demonstrators who were injured. She said trust in the police would take \u201ca million years to rebuild.\u201d The teacher said she didn\u2019t want to be identified by name because her school wants \u201call the staff to stay absolutely silent.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do without the police, but we can\u2019t rely on the police,\u201d she said. \u201cSo what do we do?\u201d", "description": "HONG KONG (AP) \u2014 As a police van sped past them, the 90-year-old woman and her 60-year-old daughter raised their fists, pointed their thumbs very", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/12/542e3a_hong-kong-protests-33482-riot-police-cross-barricade-by-protesters-protest-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
