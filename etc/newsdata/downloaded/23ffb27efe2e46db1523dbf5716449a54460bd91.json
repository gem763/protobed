Public Citizen and UFCW are asking the court to block implementation of the rule and to set it aside.\n\nLocal UFCW units joining the lawsuit represent pork slaughter workers in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota; Denison, Iowa and Bel Aire, Kansas.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The union representing workers at pork processing plants sued the federal government on Monday to challenge a new rule that allows companies to set line speeds and turn over more food safety tasks to company employees.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Pitt"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
