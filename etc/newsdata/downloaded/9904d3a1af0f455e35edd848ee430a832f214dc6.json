Now, we\u2019re going behind the scenes at Lifehacker. I\u2019m David Murphy, and this is how I work.\n\nLocation: Silicon Valley\n\nCurrent gig: Lifehacker\u2019s senior technology editor\n\nCurrent computer: Gosh, what am I even using now? It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve built a PC from the ground up, that probably means I\u2019m due for an upgrade. Right now, I\u2019m running an old-school Intel Core i7-4790K processor, and a much more modern Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 graphics card. (It\u2019s a beast.) I have an annoying mix of SSDs and HDDs in my system because I have yet to condense everything onto a single, super-speedy, gigantic SSD. (They\u2019re expensive). I do love my 34-inch widescreen display and my 5.1-surround setup, even though my computer-receiver connection is often a source of headaches.\n\nCurrent mobile device: iPhone X\n\nOne word that best describes how you work: Purposefully\n\nFirst of all, tell us a little about your background and how you got to where you are today.\n\nI graduated with undergraduate and graduate degrees in journalism from Northwestern University\u2019s Medill School of Journalism. That took me to Silicon Valley, where I started out working for the now-defunct (in print, at least) Maximum PC. Since then, my career has been a bit eclectic; I\u2019ve tried to stay in journalism as much as possible, but I\u2019ve also jumped to positions in higher education, marketing, and even permalancing \u2014 a super-fun but anxiety-inducing period of my life. I don\u2019t recommend it for everyone, but it\u2019s amazing if you can make it work.\n\nI now work for Lifehacker, because I love helping people learn new tips and tricks for all their geeky gadgets.\n\nWhat are your job responsibilities?\n\nI write most of the technology articles on the site, and I edit a number of the articles our amazing group of tech freelancers think up. I\u2019m up every morning assigning stories, pounding coffee, and trying to find all the important information you need to know about the big news of the day. I also write a weekly tech-support column, which I (always) encourage you to read and/or submit questions to. I\u2019m always happy to help you troubleshoot!\n\nTake us through a typical workday.\n\nI wake up super-early and am ready to begin my Lifehacker day at 6:00am my time, which is always a struggle. I\u2019ve never been a morning person, and I\u2019ve tried very hard to improve my feelings about that \u2014 to little success.\n\nI go over the day\u2019s assignments for the first hour or so, and then I get to work on my own stuff. Sometimes, that\u2019s writing a bunch of articles. Other times, that\u2019s tinkering with various devices or rummaging through operating systems while researching pieces I\u2019m working on. I do a lot of editing of other peoples\u2019 work, too. And before I know it, it\u2019s time to go home for the day, even though I\u2019m already home since there\u2019s no actual Lifehacker office in Silicon Valley.\n\nWhat\u2019s your workspace setup like?\n\nSince I live in the (expensive) Silicon Valley, I work in my bedroom \u2014 where I sleep, watch TV, and generally live most of my life. It\u2019s a little depressing, sure, but I suppose it\u2019s no worse than the crammed studio apartments or one-bedrooms my NYC Lifehacker colleagues have to deal with.\n\nI type on a loud mechanical keyboard (Razer BlackWidow TE Chroma) that lights up when you tap the keys because I\u2019m silly like that. My giant monitor is attached to my desk via a handy arm, and my receiver (that powers both my computer and the TV, that\u2019s wall-mounted above my head), sits in front of my keyboard. My IKEA desk isn\u2019t super messy, but it could always be cleaner.\n\nIt\u2019s not... that... messy, right? (Photo: David Murphy)\n\nWhat apps, gadgets, or tools can\u2019t you live without?\n\nMy computer (obviously) and my phone \u2014 my lifeline to the world, it seems. Years ago I might have even added something like \u201cFacebook\u201d to this list, but I find more and more that I just want to pull back from the online world and live a more private life. I realise that\u2019s kind of odd for a \u201csenior technology editor\u201d to say, but maybe that\u2019s the point. I\u2019ve been deep in the rabbit hole of technology, privacy, gadgets, and gear for the past 15 years or so. Sometimes, it feels great to come up for fresh air.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite shortcut or hack?\n\nI love the little \u201cgoodnight\u201d routine I\u2019ve set up for my Google Home smart speaker. It\u2019s simple, but it turns off all my lights, turns on the fan in my room, and plays soothing thunderstorm sounds for an hour or so as I drift off to sleep. I\u2019ve used it every single night for more than a year now, and I only wish I could do more \u2014 like have my speaker query me when I want to wake up in the morning (by fading up all the smart lights in my room at a given time, and by setting the alarm for a specific time).\n\nHow do you keep track of what you have to do?\n\nFor larger projects / reminders, the tried-and-true method of sticky notes attached to my monitor. Yes, I know that various reminder apps exist, and they\u2019re useful and all that. I just find phone notifications easier to ignore than a big yellow piece of paper staring me in the face while I work.\n\nFor everyday things, I find the Lifehacker airtable \u2014 mixed with my own little system of starring items in Slack and scheduling reminders for myself \u2014 works wonderfully for tracking the many moving pieces on the tech beat.\n\nHow do you recharge or take a break?\n\nGood question. I love naps, but I probably shouldn\u2019t rely on them as much as I do, because that makes me feel like I\u2019ve suddenly turned 80 years old and need to eat my dinners at four p.m. I\u2019m an on-and-off gamer \u2014 it depends when the mood strikes \u2014 and an aspiring outdoorsy person. I really love hiking around the Bay Area, even though I admit I am lazy about it. I do have a deep regret that I live in California and am not outside like, 23 hours of the day. It\u2019s a gorgeous state with so much to see, and I always feel like I haven\u2019t done enough. Yes, I still haven\u2019t made it to Yosemite. I am a bad Californian.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite side project? I\u2019m a huge advocate of the arts in the San Francisco Bay Area, and I run the largest Facebook group dedicated to all things theatre around these parts. I\u2019ve acted in more than 30 shows; produced shows; worked as a production manager and board member for local theatres; and seen/reviewed way, way too many productions. Theatre is incredibly important to me, and where I\u2019ve met some of my closest, most lifelong friends \u2014 and more.\n\nWhat are you currently reading, or what do you recommend?\n\nI\u2019ve been bad about books lately, because within five minutes of starting to read one before bed, I\u2019m usually asleep. They have a very calming effect \u2014 that, and the aforementioned thunderstorm sounds. Nevertheless, I\u2019m slowly working my way through The World of Warcraft Diary by John Staats, which is a wonderful, in-depth look at how the sprawling MMO was created. Also, the book itself is gorgeous.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best advice you\u2019ve ever received?\n\nI didn\u2019t receive this advice personally, but I\u2019ve always enjoyed this quote:\n\n\u201cIn the time of your life, live \u2014 so that in that wondrous time you shall not add to the misery and sorrow of the world, but shall smile to the infinite delight and mystery of it.\u201d", "description": "Every week, we share the shortcuts, workspaces and productivity tips of our favourite experts.
