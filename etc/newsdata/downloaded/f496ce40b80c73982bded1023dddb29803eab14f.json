He dishes it out a lot so the boys would be more than happy if he has to pay it.\u201d\n\nMarler continued to remonstrate with Owens as he left the pitch to take his place on the bench.\n\nEngland dominated the early skirmishes in Yokohama, with Tuilagi crashing over for the opening try after just 96 seconds \u2014 setting the All Blacks on their way to their first World Cup defeat in 12 years.\n\nHowever, New Zealand\u2019s players and coaches dismissed the significance of the haka challenge, while Springboks head coach Rassie Erasmus said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it was disrespectful\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t make a big issue about it, but it\u2019s not for me to decide.\u201d\n\nWorld Rugby\u2019s decision to fine England opens the governing body to accusations of hypocrisy, however, after trumpeting England\u2019s response to the haka with a video post that was widely viewed online.\n\nThe clip on World Rugby\u2019s YouTube channel, entitled \u201cEngland\u2019s incredible response to intense New Zealand haka\u201d, has racked up more than four million views.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 England have been fined for crossing the halfway line during New Zealand\u2019s haka after they formed a provocative V-shaped", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/ee0295_england-players-crossed-halfway-line-as-new-zealand-performed-haka-england-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
