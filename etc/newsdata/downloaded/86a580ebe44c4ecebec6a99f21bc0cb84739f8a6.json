(Charlie Neibergall/AP)\n\nThe future of one of college football\u2019s historic in-state rivalries has been questioned this week after allegations that fans at Iowa State\u2019s Jack Trice Stadium in Ames abused members of Iowa\u2019s marching band during the teams\u2019 annual game.\n\nUniversity of Iowa President Bruce Harreld told the school\u2019s student newspaper he was unsure if the \u201cCy-Hawk Game,\u201d which dates to 1894, should continue if security concerns persist.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not convinced at all that we should play this game again \u2014 here or there or anywhere \u2014 unless we can protect our fans, our band, and of course our athletes,\u201d Harreld told the Daily Iowan on Monday.\n\n\u201cSomething really bad happened in Ames,\u201d he added, although he also said he expects the schools to \u201cwork through this.\u201d\n\n[A \u2018College GameDay\u2019 sign asked for beer money. It\u2019s raised nearly $1 million for a children\u2019s hospital fundraiser.]\n\nMembers of the Hawkeye Marching Band complained of being subjected to physical violence, epithets and other targeted harassment by Iowa State fans at the Sept. 14 game in Ames, according to local media accounts and social media posts from band members.\n\nBand members said they had beer poured on them and full cans of beer thrown at them as they exited the stadium and complained of an assault by a Cyclones fan who allegedly shoved his way through the musicians, causing one to fall and break a rib.\n\nBut Tuesday, Iowa State officials said they were unable to corroborate those claims and intimated that the Iowa band shared responsibility for any incidents at the stadium.\n\nIowa State Athletic Director Jamie Pollard said at a Tuesday news conference that the Hawkeye Marching Band took the wrong exit out of the stadium toward its buses and into a crowded area, where an altercation may have taken place.\n\n\u201cThe Iowa marching band marched in formation playing their instruments into the back of that crowd and forced their way through those people,\u201d he said.\n\nIowa State University Police Chief Michael Newton said the band \u201cmarched aggressively out of the stadium. They were marching faster than people could walk in that area.\u201d\n\nHe said his office followed security camera footage of the band exiting the stadium and did not see the incident as described by band members social media posts and by Iowa officials.\n\n[The UCLA-Washington State game set records for lunacy]\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see anything happen during that time,\u201d Newton said. \u201cThe band continues to move during that time. They continue forward. There\u2019s never a stop.\u201d\n\nNewton said officers broke up a \u201cskirmish\u201d in the area that he described as \u201cpushing and shoving,\u201d but said none of the band members reported and injuries or physical altercations to the four uniformed officers that accompanied them to Ames and throughout the stadium.\n\nPollard said he had similar abuse directed at him when the Cyclones travel to Iowa\u2019s Kinnick Stadium on even-numbered years, and said current and past members of the Iowa State Cyclone Marching Band have reported similar behavior from Hawkeyes fans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had multiple Iowa State University current and former band members since this incident has become public say that they\u2019ve had vulgarity, beer, rudeness, everything that happened to our guests happened to them,\u201d Pollard said. \u201c \u2026 I\u2019ve experienced it when I\u2019ve been over in Iowa City and I\u2019m sure their [Iowa\u2019s] administration has experienced it when they come here.\"\n\nHe said Iowa Athletic Director Gary Barta told him over the phone that he was \u201c100 percent committed\u201d to continuing the Cy-Hawk series.\n\nPollard and Newton said Iowa State would not proceed with an investigation unless a victim contacts university police.\n\n[\u2018Field of Dreams\u2019 will host its first MLB game. (Sort of.)]\n\nThe two universities conducted a joint inquiry into the incidents last week that lasted two days. That elicited an uproar from Iowa band members, who complained to local media outlets.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have my back and you don\u2019t care,\u201d one band member wrote in a Facebook post directed at the Iowa athletic department.\n\nGotta love Iowa athletics and the AD. They tell us YESTERDAY they\u2019re investigating the violent acts against us in Ames.... Posted by Corey Knopp on Thursday, September 19, 2019\n\nThe uproar prompted Iowa officials to reopen their investigation.\n\n\u201cThe communication on social media made it clear we had not shared enough information with our students about the steps the university has taken to address the concerns raised by members of our marching band,\u201d an Iowa spokeswoman said Saturday in a statement provided to The Washington Post. \u201cStudent safety is our number one priority and we are committed to ensuring a safe experience on game day for our students. Additionally we are continuing our investigation to ensure all of our students have the ability to share their experiences with the appropriate authorities.\u201d\n\nHerrald, the Iowa university president, told the Daily Iowan he wanted to meet with Iowa State officials to create a crowd-control plan for the next time the teams meet if the series is to continue.\n\n\u201cI think we need to put it on paper \u2014 how large should our security forces be, where should the band bus park, what tunnel should we have a secure group of people make officers and security people protecting them,\u201d he said. \u201c \u2026 If for some reason one party or the other doesn\u2019t come to the table, then no, why would we\u201d continue the rivalry, he asked.\n\nRead more:\n\nThey were once sent home for their Olympic protest.
