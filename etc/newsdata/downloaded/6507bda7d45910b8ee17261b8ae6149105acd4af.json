I'm confident,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm looking to improve what we did last year.\n\n\"The players that have left have left a legacy. We will never forget that but I like it when you have a team with big potential.\n\n\"We need those fresh legs, we need that motivation.

I'll take him out for a beer on Friday night, hopefully get him drunk, and he probably won't turn up on Sunday,\" Sage joked.", "description": "Perth Glory captain Diego Castro believes an injection of fresh legs will help them prove the doubters wrong this A-League season.Glory were the dominant...", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
