However, he told analysts in the post-earnings call that he keeps seeing signs of stabilization in the troubled power business, and that he was \u201cmore optimistic\u201d than when he started that \u201cconsiderable value\u201d can be unlocked for shareholders.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m confident that in 2020, and in 2021, we\u2019ll see meaningfully better performance for GE as a whole,\u201d Culp said, according to a FactSet transcript.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Some expected GE CEO Larry Culp to break up the company. Instead, he\u2019s trying to fix it.\n\nThe stock GE, +10.69% soared 11% in morning trading toward a three-month high. Trading volume ballooned to over 138 million shares, enough to make the stock the most actively traded on major U.S. exchanges, and already more than triple the full-day average of about 44.4 million shares.\n\nThe stock has now run up 38% year to date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.04% has advanced 16%.\n\nThe company also continued to raise its 2019 industrial free cash flow (FCF) guidance, to a range of zero to $2 billion, from negative $1 billion to positive $1 billion as of July and from negative $2 billion to zero as of March. GE said it expects FCF to be in \u201cpositive territory\u201d in 2020, with further acceleration in 2021.\n\nFor the latest quarter, industrial FCF was $650 million, down from $1.14 billion. Analyst Andrew Obin at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said FCF was \u201csurprisingly strong\u201d as he was expecting \u201cflat.\u201d He reiterated his neutral rating, saying he views the underlying drivers of FCF as \u201crelatively low quality\u201d and with \u201climited disclosure.\u2019\n\nGE reported earlier a third-quarter net loss of $9.47 billion, or $1.08 a share, after a loss of $22.81 billion, or $2.64 a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, such as an $8.7 billion charge from ceding majority ownership of Baker Hughes and other insurance-related and goodwill charges, adjusted earnings per share rose to 15 cents from 11 cents, to beat the FactSet consensus of 12 cents.\n\nThat marks the third-straight quarter that GE beat adjusted profit expectations.\n\nTotal revenue increased 1% to $23.48 billion, with a 14% drop in revenue in its power business was offset by a 13 increase in renewable energy, 8% growth in aviation and a 5% rise in healthcare.

It was the smallest revenue decline for power since the 9% fall in the first quarter of 2018.\n\nThe revenue growth came with a 2.9% decrease in the cost of sales to $17.33 billion. Outgoing Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller said on the call that part of the decline in gross corporate costs came with job cuts, which reached about 7,000 so far this year.\n\nAlso read: GE freezing pensions for 20,000 employees.\n\nFor the rest of the year, CEO Culp said the \u201cwatch items\u201d are the same, including an uncertain global economy, trade and tariffs, the continued grounding of Boeing Co.\u2019s 737 MAX planes for which GE makes the engines, and the low interest rate environment.\n\n\u201cSo in summary, the hard work continues,\u201d Culp said. \u201cAnd from the inside, I\u2019m seeing the improvements I wanted to see when we started on this path a year ago, improvements that will yield long-term results for all of GE\u2019s stakeholders.\u201d\n\nPerhaps next quarter, Culp can stop using the \u201creset\u201d word to describe the company\u2019s progress.", "description": "Shares of General Electric Co. rocketed in very active trading Wednesday as the industrial conglomerate continued to make progress on its turnaround plan...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU312_GE_103_ZG_20191030112433.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
