If y\u2019all go to a professional juicing store with a\u2026 I got that.\n\nHey everyone, my name is Patrick Starrr, and these are the last 10 things I bought on Amazon.\n\nLet\u2019s see what I bought. I buy ridiculous things.\n\nIf you happen to know, I am a man in makeup, so I bought eight Gilette Fusion5 razors, and I did it as a subscription service, so it comes to me every month. Because this is how I get my smooth face, and I love the razors, the Gilette ones with the yellow on the top and the bottom, because they really, really smooth the skin.\n\nAlso, it is Pride Month, so I bought a rainbow backdrop because I wanted to do a cute, like, rainbow Pride look. I love changing it up with my backdrops.\n\nI also bought 2-inch, extra-large safety pins, because obviously this turban does not hold itself.\n\nSo, it was my friend\u2019s birthday, who also works with me, Fabian. He\u2019s my producer and my assistant. Always complains about these orange juice being fresh at restaurants. He\u2019s the most, utmost extra. Like, \u201cCan I have fresh orange juice?\u201d \u201cCan I have fresh orange juice?\u201d This industrial orange-juice machine, I had bought. If y\u2019all go to a professional juicing store with a I got that. And it is so sickening that we, you know, got us, you know, it\u2019s for him, for his birthday, but we got us, like, an orange-juice machine.\n\nOh, my gosh, I bought so many of these, I think everyone should have one. This is just, look, I have one in my bathroom, in my kitchen, in my beauty room. This is the mobile phone stand by ClearLook. And I literally bought, they\u2019re so\u2026 how much are these? These are $US12.99. When I want to FaceTime my friends or anything, I have one in my kitchen, my bathroom, my beauty room, my closet, my bedroom, and my studio. These are so convenient when you\u2019re FaceTiming your friends or listening to music, and I like how you can charge it. These are so fun.\n\nAll right, so, here, I love how the convenience of Amazon, you can send gifts to people that don\u2019t live near you that are special to you. So, it was my friends, one of my best friends, her baby just turned 1. And I got him a music-learning tool workbench. So it\u2019s, like, a little tool bench, and you can put, like, little shapes in it, and there\u2019s tools. He\u2019s only 1, but he loved it so much, and it\u2019s cool that I was able to attach, like, a little gift note and a card and wrapping with it. So, that was just so adorable.\n\nOh, my gosh, this next one is so embarrassing because I got, my tonsils are removed, and I was looking at different things to eat. And when you get your tonsils removed, you can\u2019t eat dairy and you can\u2019t eat solids. You can\u2019t even drink orange juice. So, I got an ice machine maker from an Asian, it says Doshisha.Electric Authentic Fluffy Ice Machine. And super cool, and I got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. I got eight syrups. I got Tiger\u2019s Blood, strawberry, pi\u00f1a colada, banana, watermelon, mango, Bahama Mama, coconut.\n\nOh, yes, and then it also had these super cute, literally the title says, Super Cute Flower Cups 10 Pack. And these are for the snow cones. People be thinking all my friends that want to come over, they be slick, they be asking to come hang out, and all they want is that d\u2014 snow cone in the flower cup with the syrup. Oh, and condensed milk, that one is really good.\n\nSo, I bought this MAC glitter, it is discontinued, do not hate on me, OK? It is Reflects Antique Gold, they discontinued it. And I found it on Amazon. Me and my friend Thomas William and Katie, I worked with them at MAC and we have been trying to look for this glitter, OK? So we\u2019re going to ration this glitter. I hope it\u2019s not a fake because this glitter was $US100. Anyways, what else did I get?\n\nI got, oh, my God, this is so extra. So, here at my photo studio, we have this big white wall, and also back here we have this\u2026 we don\u2019t have a TV in this studio, so I thought, why not just buy a projector, so I\u2026 and this was on sale. This was, like, $US100 off. So, I bought the Nebula by Anker Mars II 300 Portable Home Theatre Projector. Very, very long name. And so, we can project the images on here and just watch, you know, TV in the studio.\n\nAll right, everyone, those are all the things that I bought on Amazon recently. I hope you guys loved it. I hope you guys love Amazon as much as I do. If you guys want to see more videos, comment down below. Give this video a thumbs up, and I hope to see you all on my next video. Bye.\n\nYou just gave me an idea\u2026popcorn. You know what? I think I might have to order a popcorn machine next. And then I could be charging admission. We could serve popcorn, a movie, snow cones, orange juice. I smell a new business brewing.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
