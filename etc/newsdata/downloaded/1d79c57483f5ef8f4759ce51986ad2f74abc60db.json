And I have tried, during this period, to find a way out, through which to listen to the voice of the people,\u201d Mr Hariri said in his speech.\n\n\u201cIt is time for us to have a big shock to face the crisis. To all partners in political life, our responsibility today is how we protect Lebanon and revive its economy.\u201d\n\nProtesters responded to the announcement by chanting a refrain that has become popular during the demonstrations: \u201cAll of them means all of them,\u201d a rallying cry for the removal of all the country\u2019s political leaders.\n\n\u201cThis is the first thing we have achieved with our revolution. That\u2019s one down, many more to go,\u201d said Zeinab Mroueh, 38, at an impromptu party in downtown Beirut celebrating the news.\n\n\u201cWe were always following our leader before, but this revolution was for everybody. We all put our leaders aside. This is the first time you are seeing Muslims with Christians and Druze all together saying the same thing: everybody must resign.\u201d\n\nAnother protester, Firas Faraj, 41, said the resignation was \u201cjust the start\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time something like this has happened in Lebanon. We want to have another government, a technocratic government and we should start working on another election.\n\n\u201cNo matter what happens we have done so much. We Lebanese grew up here but we never felt this one of love for our country.\u201d\n\nLebanon\u2019s confessional political system requires that its governments are formed by consensus, and stipulates a complex power-sharing between its different religious communities.\n\nMr Hariri was named prime minister of a national unity government in January this year, nine months after the country\u2019s last elections.\n\nHis resignation will likely spark a new round of political deadlock in Lebanon, as the country seeks to form a new government.\n\nThis is the moment Hezbollah and Amal supporters attacked a peaceful protest site in downtown Beirut. This wasn\u2019t about road closures. https://t.co/Dea9hlg6T3 \u2014 Richard Hall (@_RichardHall) October 29, 2019\n\nThe protests have plunged Lebanon\u2019s political class into chaos. For the first time, the sectarian political order that has governed this eastern Mediterranean nation since the end of the civil war in 1990 is facing a mass movement aimed at its overthrow.\n\nThe combination of an acute economic crisis and decades of rampant corruption has pushed the country to the edge.\n\nLebanon has one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios in the world due to years of mismanagement. Unemployment stands at close to 25 per cent, and tens of thousands of educated young people leave the country each year due to a lack of opportunity.\n\nWhat began as a spontaneous burst of anger over a new set of taxes quickly turned into something bigger. Rather than targeting the government or any one political leader, protesters called out Lebanon\u2019s corrupt political class in its entirety.\n\nThe scale of the protests appears to have taken the government completely by surprise. In an attempt to quell the protests, Mr Hariri announced a package of reform measures last Monday. They included cutting the salaries of top officials, and abolishing several state institutions. But protesters were not convinced and continued to demonstrate.\n\nThe current government is dominated by factions allied with Hezbollah, the most powerful armed group in the country. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has been increasingly vocal in his criticism of the demonstrations. Last week he suggested that they were being influenced by foreign powers, and warned of \u201cchaos and collapse\u201d.", "description": "Lebanon\u2019s prime minister Saad Hariri resigned on Tuesday in response to nearly two weeks of nationwide anti-government protests.Mr Hariri said he had reached a \u201cdead end\u201d following 13 days of turmoil. \u201cNo one is bigger than their country,\u201d he added.", "authors": ["Richard Hall"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TGI1BolJKTtO.F3xFlAeFA--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/4290cb326a37de542e10f02b101ac754", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
