It is all the little details to build up to the end, and if you do not take care of them, it will come back to haunt you.\u201d\n\nThe Browns (1-2) got their final chance after safety Juston Burris, who was only claimed on waivers Friday amid a slew of injuries to Cleveland\u2019s defensive backs, intercepted Jared Goff with 2:46 to go.\n\nMayfield completed a 27-yard pass to Jarvis Landry on third-and-15, and after a 3-yard run, a roughing call on Rams star Aaron Donald gave the Browns first down at the 4.\n\nThey were in business.\n\nBut Mayfield couldn\u2019t connect with Landry in the end zone, the second attempt being tipped away from Rams linebacker Samson Ebukam. On third down, Mayfield looked for tight end Demetrius Harris, when he probably should have thrown the ball to Landry, who had beaten his man on a slant.\n\n\u201cI am going to have recurring nightmares over the throw to Demetrius up top,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cI will be able to look at the film and know I have Jarvis underneath. Just execute. I think that is what it comes down to. Execution down there. Doing your job. We need all 11 guys doing that, and it starts with me.\u201d\n\nNot according to Browns first-year coach Freddie Kitchens, who felt it started with him.\n\nKitchens bemoaned going for a fourth-down play earlier in the quarter and then not running the ball at least once on the last series.\n\nFollowing the game, Kitchens snapped his gum as he replayed the missed opportunities.\n\n\u201cThey did a good job at the end of the game,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did not. I did not. I did not do a good job at the end of the game.\u201d\n\nCleveland\u2019s offense still hasn\u2019t hit its stride this season, nor has it looked as good as it did over the final eight games last season when Kitchens took over play-calling duties.\n\nThe Browns remain under construction.\n\nKitchens became sensitive with a line of questioning about the difference between the Browns in 2018 and 2019.\n\n\u201cI would not say anything is missing. It takes time to develop offensively. We kind of hit the ground running last year because we had been through eight games already so we know what we were doing. I would say, I have to do a better job during the course of the week of putting these guys in better situations and then on game day.\n\n\u201cIf you are looking to blame somebody, blame me. Do not blame any of our players. Do not blame any of our other coaches. Just blame me because I can take it. Just blame me. Go write your article and say that I messed the game up. Go write your article and say that it is my fault that things are not looking like it did last year because it is.\u201d\n\nMayfield came away encouraged by a lot of what the Browns accomplished.\n\nThey were outmanned but stayed with one of the NFL\u2019s best teams.\n\n\u201cWe are going to get it fixed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind. It is three games in. We have expectations that we have set for ourselves and we have not met those. I think we need to be realistic with ourselves and know that we have not played to our capability and to our potential. We just have to be better.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Four chances, four failures.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Withers"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/rams_browns_football_45781_c0-1009-2200-2291_s1770x1032.jpg?0944f4d50c52d4c7d3db136d9f1216b487915166", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
