Surprisingly for what is, at after, a species of Batman film, it was awarded the Leone d\u2019Oro for best film at the Venice Film Festival,and Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s nomination for an Academy Award for his performance already is generally assumed.\n\nBut we live in philistine times, and the mob demands that art serve them. For that reason, film, television, literature, music, and much else is subjected to a standard of social utilitarianism, meaning that they are not judged on aesthetic criteria but for their value as propaganda, moral instruction, or therapy. Therapeutic notions are at the moment especially prevalent; that is why press criticism of Game of Thrones, to take one example, dealt with questions of demographic \u201crepresentation\u201d to the exclusion of almost everything else.\n\nAnd so Joker is challenged on its \u201cfitness for the present political moment,\u201d as Sam Adams puts it in Slate. \u201cIs this really the time for a story about a frustrated, alienated white man who turns to violence?\u201d he asks. Of course it is, which is why there are at least five productions of Coriolanus under way, and the bestsellers lists are full of worked about frustrated, alienated white men who turn to violence \u2014 strangely, no one criticizes Margaret Atwood on those grounds. (What, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and The Testaments aren\u2019t about frustrated, violent white guys?) Joker is in fact now criticized on the grounds of empathy, or at least suspicion of empathy.", "description": "", "authors": ["Kevin Williamson", "Nationalreview.Com Joker-Movie-Moralistic-Critics-Everybody-Is-Tipper-Gore-Now"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
