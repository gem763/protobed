Of that, AU$68 million was made up of goodwill impairment, while restructuring and integration costs was AU$56 million.\n\nThe immediate parent and ultimate controlling party of DXC Technology Australia are Computer Sciences Corporation International Holdings Limited -- incorporated in the UK -- and DXC Technology Company -- incorporated in the US.\n\nDXC Technology Australia, which wholly-owned 91 subsidiaries during the period, paid AU$10.7 million in income tax for the year.\n\nOther expenses that impacted the business during the period included employee and other labour related costs, which included termination benefits and defined contribution plans for its 4,298 employees. This came in at AU$587 million, slightly less than the AU$619 million reported in FY17.\n\nSee also: Hybrid IT leads the way in HPE's revamped business strategy (TechRepublic)\n\nContract-related expenses was AU$357.7 million, down AU$368 million, the company's 2018 financial report stated.\n\nMeanwhile, total depreciation and amortisation was AU$52.7 million. That accounted for AU$11.8 million of customer contracts, which was on-par with numbers recorded in 2017.\n\nRevenue from continuing operations for the year decreased by 5.4% from AU$1.24 billion to AU$1.17 billion.\n\n\"The decrease in revenue reflects the ongoing migration out of legacy infrastructure environments, partially offset by growth in our cloud infrastructure, Enterprise and Cloud applications, and digital workplace offerings,\" DXC Australia said.\n\nDXC said however, the company's revenue from continuing operations would have been in a better state coming in at AU$2.3 billion had transactions related to its internal restructure been effective at 1 April 2017. These transactions included share transfers between XUK Holdco, ES Hague, and Continuum Europe.\n\nFollowing the merger, DXC Australia acquired Sable Systems for AU$34 million and Systems Partners for AU$22 million.\n\nEarlier this year, DXC Technology scooped up Luxoft for $2 billion to accelerate its digital growth and scale-out strategy, as well as broaden access to digital talent, with Luxoft boasting a workforce of close to 13,000 people.\n\nRelated Coverage", "description": "The Australian arm of DXC Technology is still feeling the effects of Computer Sciences Corp and the enterprise services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise merging.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/02/14/d6ee38cb-1956-4bf8-a495-4057b0ce435e/thumbnail/770x578/95223c958421158ae2b274a91329321f/datagraphsistock-913219882.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
