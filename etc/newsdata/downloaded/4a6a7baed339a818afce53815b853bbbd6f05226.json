CNN said it would happen relatively soon.\n\nTrump's Turkey deal hands power to Ankara and leaves Syrian Kurds for dead Read more\n\nTrump has justified his decision to stand US troops down to allow a Turkish offensive in north-eastern Syria at the cost of abandoning Kurdish partners, by saying he was \u201cbringing the troops home\u201d.\n\nHowever, it is quite likely it would take more troops to deploy, maintain, supply and protect armoured units in the middle of the eastern Syrian desert than the roughly 1,000 that were in the country before the Turkish invasion.\n\nThe contradiction has been apparent in Trump\u2019s remarks in recent days, in which he claimed the US had \u201csecured the oil\u201d even while withdrawing its forces.\n\n\u201cIt would mean walling off eastern Syria as a US zone,\u201d Aaron Stein, director of the Middle East programme at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Washington, said of the plan to put tanks around the Conoco plant. \u201cYou would have to protect it from the air. You have to supply it and then you have got to protect the road, presumably from Iraq. You can easily see a scenario where we end up with more troops in Syria than we started off with.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Trump added to the confusion on Thursday by tweeting: \u201cPerhaps it is time for the Kurds to start heading to the Oil Region!\u201d\n\nThe remark seemed to endorse a population transfer from the Kurdish areas along the border with Turkey southwards to the almost entirely Sunni Arab area of Deir Ezzor. Such a mass displacement of Kurds from their homes would fit with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s plans to resettle north-eastern Syria with Syrian Arab refugees to create a buffer zone against Kurdish insurgents. Kurdish refugees in Turkey are already reported to be subject to forcible deportation.\n\nOn Tuesday, Erdo\u011fan struck a deal with Vladimir Putin on a 30km-deep \u201csafe zone\u201d in which Russian military police and Syrian border guards would oversee the withdrawal of armed Kurdish units from the area.\n\nSuch mass demographic changes \u2013 carried out at the barrel of a gun \u2013 risk prolonging Syria\u2019s multiple-front conflict indefinitely, said Jan Egeland, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council and the UN\u2019s former humanitarian chief.\n\n\u201cThis was an area of relative stability, before all of these deals,\u201d said Egeland, who was also the UN\u2019s special adviser on Syria. \u201cWe need to remind all of these people with the power and the guns that this is no chessboard. It is a place where people live. There are two to three million civilians in this area. I cannot see how this can be a safe zone for long with so many different armed parties.\u201d\n\nEgeland said about 180,000 people, half of them children, had been displaced as a consequence of the Turkish incursion. He added that Kurds arriving at overcrowded camps in Iraq said that many more would join the exodus from the north-east but could not afford to pay people-smugglers who charge hundreds of dollars per person.\n\nEgeland said the mass displacement of populations was being brought about as a consequence of \u201cexplosive, improvised deals\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor many, the move will not be voluntary and they will displacing the original population there. No problems will be solved and new problems will be created,\u201d he said.\n\nThe US special envoy for Syria, James Jeffrey, admitted on Wednesday that \u201ca bit more than 100 Isis detainees have escaped\u201d from captivity as a result of the chaos triggered by the Turkish incursion. Trump claimed on the same day that the escaped Isis fighters had been \u201clargely recaptured\u201d. Jeffrey told Congress: \u201cWe do not know where they are.\u201d\n\nThere was also considerable uncertainty on Thursday of the fate of nearly 70,000 people, almost all women and children in the al-Hawl camp in north-eastern Syria. Some of them are families of Isis fighters, but many are civilians swept up in formerly Isis-run areas.\n\nThe UN\u2019s assistant secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, Ursula Mueller, said the situation in the camp was \u201cdesperate\u201d. In a warning directed largely to western nations, Mueller said: \u201cMember states have the primary responsibility for their own nationals, and policies and actions that lead to statelessness should be avoided.\u201d", "description": "Armoured units already in the Middle East poised for deployment to gas plant", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446f478600fbc246f3a93592a45ef4299ed7ddb5/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=61c22f73ce4c62ceaa22d1ce4ed092a8", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
