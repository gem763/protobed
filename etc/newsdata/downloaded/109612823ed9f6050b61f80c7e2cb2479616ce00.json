But it doesn\u2019t mean that we will have an easy life,\u201d said Leclerc.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve only been to Suzuka once but it\u2019s a track I loved. It was just a really great experience, so I\u2019m really looking forward to going back.\u201d\n\nThe Silver Arrows\u2019 unexpected one-two in Sochi means Mercedes can seal a record-equalling sixth successive constructors\u2019 championship this weekend if they manage to increase their lead over Ferrari by 14 points or more.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Lewis Hamilton may not be able to clinch a sixth world championship at the typhoon-threatened Japanese Grand Prix this weekend, but", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/b32db8_lewis-hamilton-takes-chequered-flag-win-japanese-grand-prix-suzuka-year-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
