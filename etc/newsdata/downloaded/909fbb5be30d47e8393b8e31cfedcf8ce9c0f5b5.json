But have you ever heard of them doing the protesting?\n\nLaw enforcement officers who endorse the President are making a move. And it\u2019s a bit of a rallying one, but in good taste.\n\nThe day after Trump announced an upcoming Minneapolis rally, the department passed down a spankin\u2019 new edict: You can\u2019t wear your uniforms to political events.\n\nJohn Elder, a police spokesman, explained to USA Today that the rule is in place to prevent confusion:\n\n\u201cThe uniform gets translated back to the average person as someone being from the police department. It\u2019s very confusing for people when they see someone in uniform to understand the difference between the city and the [police union].\u201d\n\nThe head of the local union was unimpressed. In his view, the ban was simply a way for Democrats in charge to prevent a show of boys(and girls)-in-blue GOP support.\n\nA show, incidentally, the President would probably be expecting:\n\nTrump often surrounds himself with men and women in uniform, both in the White House and on the campaign trail. He has has long painted himself as a pro-law enforcement president, ranging from his sharp criticism of NFL player protests during the national anthem over police brutality to the Department of Justice\u2019s slowed pace of civil rights investigations into local police departments. In February at the Major County Sheriffs and the Major Cities Chiefs Association Joint Conference, he renewed his commitment to law enforcement, vowing to make \u201cofficer safety a top priority.\u201d \u201cIn my administration, we understand that reducing crime begins with respecting law enforcement. We will not tolerate smears, or slanders or assaults on those who wear the badge and police our streets,\u201d he said.\n\nRight. So what\u2019s a policing Trump fan to do?\n\nWell, the answer is a colorful one.\n\nAs indicated by Lt. Bob Kroll, president of the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis, The Donald will be bolstered by lotsa law enforcement dudes and dudettes sporting red \u201cCops for Trump\u201d shirts.\n\nPolice sell \u2018Cops for Trump\u2019 shirts for officers to wear at Minneapolis rally https://t.co/yhjpUqJxIY \u2014 Miami Herald (@MiamiHerald) October 7, 2019\n\nThe Commander-in-Chief is psyched about the impending Red Sea:\n\nThank you to Lt.
