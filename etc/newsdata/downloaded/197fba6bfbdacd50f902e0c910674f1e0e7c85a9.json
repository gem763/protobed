These include factors such as local business conditions, both current and projected; the jobs market and employment conditions; as well as mean family incomes, both present and future.\n\nFor businesses, managing and balancing consumer expectations and perceptions is as important as managing debt and investor perceptions.\n\nCompanies, whether public or small business enterprises, almost always borrow money at some point in order to capitalize new ventures and manage cash flow.\n\nThe subsequent loan repayments are based on interest rates that put the business at the mercy of the Federal Reserve.\n\nBy determining the Fed Funds rate, the Reserve directly impacts variable and short-term interest rates for companies. Maintaining a low debt position in relation to these loans can improve a company's brand perception and improve its stock growth.\n\nAs reported by JAG Capital Management in February 2018, low-debt growth stocks have annualized 17.1% returns over the past 23 years versus 7.5% for their high-debt peers.\n\nSince 1995, companies with stable or minimal growth in debt have tended to enjoy stronger returns when compared to organizations carrying top debt loads.\n\nStocks that maintain a low debt policy have typically proved much better than high-debt stocks, with EPS growth at 11% for companies with higher levels of debt as compared to businesses with low or lighter debt that have enjoyed 16% EPS growth.\n\nEyes On The Prize\n\nCompanies wanting to improve consumer confidence and investor enthusiasm in relation to their debt need to keep the following issues in mind:\n\nFinancial transparency.\n\nContinuing product and service innovation.\n\nMaintaining a low debt threshold.\n\nBrand and public relations management.\n\nThe impact of economic and political transitions.\n\nEnsure that the focus on development and growth is clear and concise.\n\nEvery company has, at some point, experienced the threat of debt overload. Combined with periods of consumer disinterest and investor hesitation, companies can lose a lot of ground quickly.\n\nAt these times, investor relationships become critical in maintaining market position and in rebuilding momentum.\n\nDebt management presents businesses with both a challenging test and an opportunity to improve investor and consumer confidence in a company's leadership and long-term viability.\n\nStructuring a policy that helps ensure low debt levels and that continually examines historical trends, current market data and future expectations should be the daily work on the ground for a corporation.\n\nThese strategies will help ensure the highest level of consumer and investor participation in a brand.\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
