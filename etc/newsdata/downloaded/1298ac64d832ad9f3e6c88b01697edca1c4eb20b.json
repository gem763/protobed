He was 78.\n\nPublicist Kathie Berlin said Forster died of brain cancer following a brief illness. He was at home in Los Angeles, surrounded by family, including his four children and partner Denise Grayson.\n\nCondolences poured in Friday night on social media. Bryan Cranston called Forster a \u201clovely man and a consummate actor\u201d in a tweet. The two met on the 1980 film Alligator and then worked together again on the television show Breaking Bad and its spinoff film, El Camino, which launched Friday on Netflix.\n\n\u201cI never forgot how kind and generous he was to a young kid just starting out in Hollywood,\u201d Cranston wrote.\n\nHis Jackie Brown co-star Samuel L. Jackson tweeted that Forster was \u201ctruly a class act/Actor!!\u201d\n\nA native of Rochester, New York, Forster quite literally stumbled into acting when in college, intending to be a lawyer, he followed a fellow female student he was trying to talk to into an auditorium where Bye Bye Birdie auditions were being held. He would be cast in that show, that fellow student would become his wife with whom he had three daughters, and it would start him on a new trajectory as an actor.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Forster, right, with Pam Grier in Jackie Brown.

He would soon make his film debut in the 1967 John Huston film Reflections in a Golden Eye, which starred Marlon Brando and Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nForster would go on to star in Haskell Wexler\u2019s documentary-style Chicago classic Medium Cool and the detective television series Banyon. It was an early high point that he would later say was the beginning of a \u201c27-year slump\u201d.\n\nHe worked consistently throughout the 1970s and 1980s in mostly forgettable B-movies \u2014 ultimately appearing in over 100 films, many out of necessity.\n\n\u201cI had four kids, I took any job I could get,\u201d he said in an interview with the Chicago Tribune last year. \u201cEvery time it reached a lower level I thought I could tolerate, it dropped some more, and then some more. Near the end, I had no agent, no manager, no lawyer, no nothing. I was taking whatever fell through the cracks.\u201d\n\nIt was Quentin Tarantino\u2019s 1997 film Jackie Brown that put him back on the map. Tarantino created the role of Max Cherry with Forster in mind; the actor had unsuccessfully auditioned for a part in \u201cReservoir Dogs,\u201d but the director promised not to forget him.\n\nIn an interview with Fandor last year, Forster recalled that when presented with the script for Jackie Brown, he told Tarantino, \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re not going to let you hire me.\u201d Tarantino replied: \u201cI hire anybody I want.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s when I realised I was going to get another shot at a career,\u201d Forster said. \u201cHe gave me a career back and the last 14 years have been fabulous.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Forster in Haskell Wexler\u2019s Medium Cool.

He ultimately lost the golden statuette to Robin Williams, who won that year for Good Will Hunting.\n\nAfter Jackie Brown, he worked consistently and at a decidedly higher level than during the \u201cslump\u201d, appearing in films like David Lynch\u2019s Mulholland Drive, Me, Myself and Irene, The Descendants, Olympus Has Fallen, and What They Had, and in television shows like Breaking Bad and the Twin Peaks revival. He said he loved trying out comedy as Tim Allen\u2019s father in Last Man Standing.\n\nHe\u2019ll also appear later this year in the Steven Spielberg-produced Apple+ series Amazing Stories.\n\nEven in his down days, Forster always considered himself lucky. \u201cYou learn to take whatever jobs there are and make the best you can out of whatever you\u2019ve got. And anyone in any walk of life, if they can figure that out, has a lot better finish than those who cannot stand to take a picture that doesn\u2019t pay you as much or isn\u2019t as good as the last one,\u201d he told IndieWire in 2011. \u201cAttitude is everything.\u201d\n\nForster is survived by his four children, four grandchildren and Grayson, his partner of 16 years.", "description": "Forster was a versatile character actor whose career was unexpectedly rescued by his Oscar-nominated role in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s cult thriller", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba3e67d9004d2028b2eb8b5051696a46b21abb14/0_234_2608_1565/master/2608.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b93308b187e3808226bd09dd9494f242", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
