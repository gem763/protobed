Mourinho, for the first season, he did amazingly, he improved the team, won things.\n\n\u2018OK, the second season was a bit more difficult, but he tried, you know, and did his best to help the team. Then they decided to sack him.\u2019\n\nUnited have now had four different managers in the six years since Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s retirement in 2013.\n\nMourinho was handed a new deal less than a year before he was sacked and Fellaini believes he deserved more time.\n\nAsked if Mourinho was sacked too soon, Fellaini said: \u2018For me, yes, because a manager like that comes and he needs a lot of players to implement his own philosophy. He wanted to build his team and after two years, or two years and a half, they decided to sack him because the results were not there.\n\n\u2018They brought in Moyes, they didn\u2019t give him time. They brought in Van Gaal, they gave him two years and we started to do some things, he won the Cup, but after that they sacked the manager because they want to win quickly, I think. A manager like Van Gaal tactically is very strong and has a lot of experience and they sacked him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But when you look to build a team you need time, not change a manager every two years, every year. If the manager doesn\u2019t do well for four or five games, they want to sack him.\u2019\n\nMORE: Juan Mata \u2018loves\u2019 Anthony Martial and says injured Manchester United star has \u2018incredible\u2019 career ahead of him", "description": "Former Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini says the club made a mistake in sacking Jose Mourinho last December.
