We have two historically bad underdogs", "language": "en", "text": "If you\u2019re in a survivor pool, at least you have a couple of easy picks this week.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing some history in the NFL this week, as it pertains to the point spreads. The Dallas Cowboys are a 21.5-point favorite over the Miami Dolphins and the New England Patriots are a 22.5-point favorite over the New York Jets, via the odds on the Yahoo Pro Football Pick\u2019em. In Las Vegas, the Patriots\u2019 line has crept up to 22 or 22.5.\n\nSpreads that large are really, really rare in the NFL. And we\u2019ve never seen two this large in the same week.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nPro Football Reference\u2019s database on spreads goes back to 1978, the same year the schedule expanded to 16 games. Over the past 41 seasons and two weeks, there have been only six games with a spread of more than 21 points. Having two underdogs catching more than 21 points in the same week is unheard of. This is the first time there has been a spread of more than 21 points in the first month of the season.\n\n1987: Cowboys (-21.5) vs. Eagles\n\n2007: Patriots (22.5) vs. Dolphins\n\n1987: 49ers (-23) at Falcons\n\n1993: 49ers (-24) vs. Bengals\n\n2007: Patriots (-24.5) vs. Eagles\n\n2013: Broncos (-26.5) vs. Jaguars\n\nWhat do all of those underdogs have in common? All six covered the spread. None of them won straight up, though the 2007 Eagles lost by only three points. So, according to PFR\u2019s data, no NFL favorite dating back to 1978 has ever covered a spread of more than 21 points.\n\nIt isn\u2019t good for the game that two of the 16 games look like a bad SEC non-conference matchup. If the Dolphins don\u2019t show more signs of life, we\u2019re likely to see them again on the plus-21 list later this season. Maybe multiple times. The NFL can\u2019t love that one of its teams is blatantly tanking.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Dolphins and Jets seem to have little chance to win straight up, but the point spread evens things out. Neither inspires much confidence.\n\nIf you have to pick one, maybe Miami is the answer. At least they\u2019ll get somewhat competent quarterback play from new starter Josh Rosen. Jets quarterback Luke Falk, the team\u2019s third option until Sam Darnold and Trevor Siemian went down, was on the Jets\u2019 practice squad as of Monday afternoon. He took his first NFL snaps on Monday night. The Patriots have a very good defense and it\u2019s hard to see the Jets scoring more than about 10 points.\n\nI pick every game in this weekly post, or I\u2019d lay off both of these unusual mismatches. But I\u2019ll take the Dolphins to cover their large spread and the Patriots to win by more than 22.5. And hopefully we won\u2019t see many more three-touchdown spreads in the NFL this season.\n\nJosh Rosen and the Miami Dolphins are off to a bad start this season. (Getty Images)\n\nHere are the rest of the picks for Week 3 of the NFL season:\n\nSUPERCONTEST\n\nBroncos (+7.5) over Packers: The Packers are 2-0 but the offense still is not right. After starting fast last week against the Vikings, Green Bay gained 154 yards and had no points on its last 11 drives. It sounds strange to say about an Aaron Rodgers-led team, but I don\u2019t think the Packers can score enough to cover this spread.\n\nColts (-1.5) over Falcons: I\u2019ve been pretty impressed with the Colts. They\u2019re well coached. They play hard. I\u2019d feel even better about them if I knew running back Marlon Mack (calf) and linebacker Darius Leonard (concussion) were playing. (The spread is Colts minus-2 in the Yahoo Pro Football Pick\u2019em.)\n\nChiefs (-6.5) over Ravens: It\u2019s hard to know what to make of the Ravens. Lamar Jackson looks great, but they have played the Dolphins and Cardinals. And the Ravens struggled to put away the Cardinals at home. If the Ravens can go into Kansas City and put a scare into the Chiefs I\u2019ll be sold on them, but I want to see it first.\n\nSteelers (+6.5) over 49ers: The 49ers offense clicked last week, but I\u2019m not giving up on Pittsburgh yet. Mason Rudolph looked OK in a tough spot last week and has played well in the preseason. They\u2019ll rally around him.\n\nRams (-3) over Browns: It\u2019s slippery to apply the transitive property in the NFL. But, the Browns were blown out at home by the Titans in Week 1. The Titans have looked bad in the two games since. Maybe Cleveland just isn\u2019t very good? The Browns weren\u2019t exactly impressive against a decimated Jets team in Week 2. It\u2019s hard to trust them yet, even as home underdogs on prime time.\n\nAnd here are the rest of the picks ...\n\nTitans (-1.5) over Jaguars (picked Thursday): My handicapping was off because I expected Marcus Mariota to outplay rookie Gardner Minshew. Mariota just isn\u2019t the guy Tennessee hoped he\u2019d be.\n\nBengals (+6) over Bills: This is a look-ahead spot for the Bills, who get the Patriots next week. Cincinnati wasn\u2019t impressive last week, but hopefully the team we saw in Week 1 shows up.\n\nRaiders (+8) over Vikings: Minnesota generally plays well against bad teams and the Raiders are probably in that category, but the Vikings aren\u2019t going to be a high-scoring team and this seems like too many points.\n\nEagles (-6.5) over Lions: I\u2019d have liked the Eagles a lot more if it wasn\u2019t for their injury report. The Lions are a hard team to figure out; they should be 2-0 but blew a game against the Cardinals. They also could be 0-1-1 but the Chargers gave them last week\u2019s game.\n\nPanthers (-2.5) over Cardinals: Yes, I know Cam Newton likely isn\u2019t playing. I have a feeling the Panthers play well with Kyle Allen. There\u2019s also this: Joe Osborne of OddsShark said teams that start 0-2 against the spread are 16-5 (76 percent) against the spread the past three seasons, and 65.7 percent over the last five seasons. The Panthers are in that spot (the other 0-2 ATS teams, according to OddsShark, are the Dolphins, Jets, Steelers, Eagles, Giants, Bears and Saints).\n\nGiants (+6.5) over Buccaneers: I don\u2019t feel great about it, considering the Buccaneers should be able to score on the Giants defense and I\u2019m not entirely convinced Daniel Jones\u2019 great preseason means he is an immediate success in the regular season. But if the Giants have a good effort in them, it\u2019s probably this week.\n\nTexans (+3) over Chargers: The Chargers are hard to trust. The injuries are an issue. And they just find ways to lose. It doesn\u2019t seem that will ever change.\n\nSeahawks (-4) over Saints: I generally like taking teams when the line overreacts to a quarterback change, but I\u2019m not sure this is a huge overreaction. There\u2019s a lot of faith in Teddy Bridgewater (or will it be Taysom Hill?) and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s justified. Bridgewater is easy to root for but his NFL resume isn\u2019t great upon close inspection. We\u2019ll see what he does with a full week to prepare as the starter, assuming he does start.\n\nBears (-4) over Redskins: For all the angst over the Bears\u2019 offense, the defense has been excellent. I\u2019m not sure how Washington will score on Chicago.\n\nLast week: 9-7\n\nSeason to date: 18-15\n\nSuperContest: 3-2 last week, 5-5 season to date\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nFrank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
