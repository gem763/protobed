I know cause I been there.. all it\u2019s gonna do is make you miserable. Don\u2019t let ME of all people get you feeling that way. Trust me, I\u2019m not worth the energy, nobody should be worth that energy! \u2014 Hailey Bieber (@haileybieber) October 7, 2019\n\nSome fans reacted strongly to the couple's recreation because of the recent feud between them and Taylor, which stems back to the \"Lover\" singer's drama with Justin's friend and manager, Scooter Brawn.\n\nAs for the original video, Taylor appeared to be shocked and embarrassed when the late-night host played it on air.\n\n\"I can't even be mad. I'm just impressed that you infiltrated my family,\" Taylor told Jimmy. \"I don't even know how you did that! Nobody has my mom's number.\"\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nJustin Bieber Reenacts Taylor Swift\u2019s Banana Freak Out Moment\n\nWatch Taylor Swift Freak Out Over a Banana After Lasik Surgery\n\nJustin and Hailey Bieber Pose in Their Underwear for New Calvin Klein Photo Shoot\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "Justin's mom, Pattie Mallette, also weighed in on the controversy.", "authors": ["Paige Gawley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/v6AxU2LsA7rF9J8x89iDUA--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/f57e91993d30a9d4e830e50be099d373", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
