Joe Sestak, for one, is trying the stunt of walking across the state of New Hampshire \u2014 mimicking his trek across Pennsylvania during his unsuccessful U.S. Senate bid in 2016.\n\n\u201cHe can keep his weight down, but it didn\u2019t help him,\u201d said G. Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin and Marshall College poll. \u201cIf you\u2019re not on the debate stage, you just got to shake your head and say, unless you\u2019re going to fund your own campaign or some up with a huge amount of money other than the investment of time and energy that they put into it, what\u2019s the whole point of it?\u201d\n\nUnlike some of his other lesser-known rivals, which include former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, and author Marianne Williamson, Mr. Sestak has yet to qualify for any of the debates.\n\nBut the former Navy admiral, who essentially moved into an Econo Lodge in Iowa for a period of time, says he plans to stick it out at least through the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses.\n\n\u201cDiscouraged? Come on. With any kind of exposure we\u2019re going to do all right,\u201d he recently told the Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\nBut Bret Nilles, a top Democratic Party official in Linn County, said candidates like Mr. Sestak and Ms. Williamson who announced they were essentially moving to the state have never really had much of a tangible staff presence in the area.\n\n\u201cThey got to start catching some excitement [and] some events up here shortly \u2014 otherwise it\u2019s really going to become a really difficult challenge,\u201d Mr. Nilles said.\n\nMr. Madonna said it probably makes more sense for lesser-known candidates to start punching up at their fellow Democrats, since all the candidates are clearly not fans of President Trump.\n\n\u201cThe question is, can they have a breakout moment?\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to go after the front-runners in a way that\u2019s credible it can\u2019t be based on an act of desperation.\u201d\n\nSen. Michael Bennet has trained some of his attacks recently on Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is jockeying with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden for front-runner status, saying Ms. Warren needs to better explain the costs of her universal Medicare-for-all proposal.\n\nThe Colorado Democrat said he hopes to stay in the race at least through the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, and that his record appeals to Obama-Trump voters who might be leery of the Democratic Party\u2019s lurch to the left.\n\n\u201cIf history is any guide, the leading candidates today are not going to be the people that do the best in those two contests,\u201d he said in a recent appearance on CNN.\n\nHe tried to downplay the impact of the debates.\n\n\u201cVoters in these early states are just beginning to make up their mind[s], so I had a decision to make, which was whether to spend my resources trying to bribe my way onto the debate stage or to communicate with voters in the early states and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing instead in Iowa and New Hampshire,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Bullock, meanwhile, has tried to emphasize his political successes in a state Mr. Trump easily carried in 2016 and said that candidates can\u2019t play the president\u2019s game and expect to win.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the answer is to out-Trump Trump, right? You wrestle with a pig, you both get muddy and the pig likes it,\u201d Mr. Bullock said at a \u201cPolitics and Eggs\u201d event in New Hampshire on Friday. \u201cI think that you call him out \u2014 you actually call out the facts. You don\u2019t shy from standing up to him. But you don\u2019t make it all about him, either.\u201d\n\nStill, analysts say it will be a difficult path without the kind of exposure and resources that the top-tier contenders can attract.\n\n\u201cAt this point, it\u2019s getting increasingly difficult for anybody to break out,\u201d said Thomas Mills, the publisher of a political website in North Carolina who has also been a Democratic consultant.\n\nHe did say that Mr. Bullock and Mr. Bennet are candidates who have resumes and messages that have \u201cbroader appeal\u201d than those of some of the front-runners in the race.\n\n\u201cWithout some sort of big event, it\u2019s hard to see either one of them getting the traction they need,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth Mr. Bennet and Mr. Bullock raised more than $2 million in the third quarter, and Ms. Williamson brought in about $3 million.\n\nBut those solid-if-unspectacular totals pale in comparison to the top tier of contenders; Sen. Bernard Sanders and Ms. Warren both brought in approximately $25 million.\n\nAllan Lichtman, an American University history professor, said time is running out for such candidates to make an impact in the race.\n\n\u201cReally the only way you could make a hit like that and vault over 10 other candidates would be [to] have some unique, absolutely burning issue,\u201d Mr. Lichtman said.\n\nHe pointed to George McGovern\u2019s latching onto the Vietnam War to surge to the Democratic presidential nomination in 1972 almost out of nowhere.\n\n\u201c[He] was able to inspire a whole army of young people without spending a huge amount of money,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see any of the also-ran candidates right now with that kind of burning issue.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
