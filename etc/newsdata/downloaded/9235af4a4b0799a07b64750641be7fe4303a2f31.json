So backing it brought little risk of breaking up the government he wanted to lead one day. It would be a risk-free bet on himself.\"\n\nCameron said that one of the \"greatest miscalculations I made was that I thought moderate Eurosceptics would see, like me, that staying in and fighting, with new reforms agreed, with all the opt-outs secured, with all the advantages over trade and co-operation, was the right course.\"\n\nBut Cameron is most critical of Gove. He accuses Gove of stabbing him of stabbing him in the back as soon as Cameron had struck a deal in Brussels meant to allay domestic concerns about the U.K.'s EU membership, especially on immigration.\n\n\u201cAs for Michael, one quality shone through: disloyalty. Disloyalty to me and, later, disloyalty to Boris,\u201d Cameron wrote.\n\n\u201cBy the end, Boris and Michael seemed to me to be different people. Boris had backed something he didn\u2019t believe in. Michael had backed something he did perhaps believe in, but in the process had broken with his friends ... while taking up positions that were completely against his political identity,\" the former prime minister wrote.\n\n\"Both then behaved appallingly, attacking their own government, turning a blind eye to their side\u2019s unpleasant actions and becoming ambassadors for the expert-trashing, truth-twisting age of populism.\u201d\n\nCameron also called the Brexit campaign \"a cauldron of toxicity, including figures such as Nigel Farage, Dominic Cummings and the businessman Arron Banks.\"\n\nOther government ministers also got scathing reviews for their part in the Brexit campaign. Of Priti Patel, the current home secretary and a former employment minister, Cameron said: \"She used every announcement, interview and speech to hammer the government on immigration, even though she was part of that government. I was stuck, though, unable to fire her, because that would make her a Brexit martyr.\u201d\n\nHe also accused Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn of failing to commit to the Remain campaign, saying he \u201cdelivered a handful of desultory speeches about remain and then went on holiday. Perhaps Corbyn wanted remain to lose.\u201d", "description": "Former PM rips into successor and accuses Gove of disloyalty.", "authors": ["Kalina Oroschakoff", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/h_54420777-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
