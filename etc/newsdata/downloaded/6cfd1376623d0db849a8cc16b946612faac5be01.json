The palace declined to say more or provide details \u201cgiven the particulars of the claims are not yet public.\u201d\n\nNews Group Newspapers, which owns The Sun and the now defunct News of the World, acknowledged the prince\u2019s High Court action while Reach, which owns the Mirror, said it was \u201caware that proceedings have been issued\u201d but hasn\u2019t yet received notice of them.\n\nThe cases escalate Harry\u2019s fight with the British tabloids. It comes days after his American wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, sued the Mail on Sunday for alleged copyright infringement, misuse of private information and violating the U.K.\u2019s data protection law after the paper published a letter she wrote to her father.\n\nHarry then lambasted British tabloids after Meghan filed her lawsuit on Tuesday, saying in a statement that his wife\u2019s lawsuit, which was months in the making, was a response to a \u201cruthless campaign\u201d to smear her by creating \u201clie after lie at her expense\u201d during her maternity leave.\n\nThe prince accused the British media of hounding Meghan the way it did his mother, Princess Diana, who died in a 1997 car crash while trying to elude paparazzi.\n\nBritish tabloid newspapers have paid millions of dollars to settle claims that their employees had hacked the phone voicemails of celebrities, politicians and others in the public eye.\n\nThe prince\u2019s lawsuits likely date back years. The News of the World was shut down in 2011, at the height of the hacking scandal and when its former editors later went on trial, a court heard evidence that indicated Harry along with his old brother, Prince William, were targets of the paper\u2019s illicit interception of phone messages.\n\nA transcript of one of the messages read at the trial came from a 2006 recording of William pretending to be Harry\u2019s girlfriend at the time, revealing the extent of media intrusion into their lives.\n\nHarry and William have long had a strained relationship with the press. They grew up in the spotlight and were young boys when their parents\u2019 acrimonious divorce received wall-to-wall coverage.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Prince Harry is suing The Sun and the Daily Mirror, two of Britain's most popular tabloid newspapers, over alleged phone hacking.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kelvin Chan"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/south_africa_royals_visit_78775_c0-45-1550-948_s1770x1032.jpg?e3514679cabf5d0330d5f836f94ce37540e42c41", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
