Go outside\n\nDr Thiyagarajan revealed that making the most of the daylight hours was 'vital', despite how difficult it might feel.\n\nHe said: 'Although going outside may feel like the last thing you want to do, it can be useful to make the most out of the daylight hours where you can.'\n\nHe added that it didn't matter if the weather seemed grey or drizzly outside, saying: 'Vitamin D from the sun \u2013 even when it\u2019s behind the clouds during daytime \u2013 can be beneficial for your body and mood.'\n\nDr Thiyagarajan also suggested: 'It can be useful to bring the outside in by keeping curtains and blinds open and sitting close to windows, too.\n\n'Factor these tips into each day so it becomes routine.'\n\nDr Thiyagarajan suggested taking time outside, no matter the weather, could help tackle Seasonal Affective Disorder\n\n2. Nourish your body\n\nDr Thiyagarajan pointed to the importance of nourishing your body, despite what your cravings may be telling you.\n\nHe said: 'Even though you may be craving carbohydrates and treats, it\u2019s still important to make sure that you\u2019re eating little and often, and from all the food groups \u2013 not just carbohydrates - so it\u2019s well balanced, as this gives your body all the nutrients it needs to function properly.'\n\nHe added: 'Don\u2019t forget to keep yourself hydrated too, as this will help to keep you energised.'\n\n3. Exercise\n\nDr Thiyagarajan also suggested exercise was vital in beating the autumn blues.\n\nHe said: 'One great benefit of exercise is the endorphins that are released when you\u2019re active.\n\n'Endorphins \u2013 mood boosting hormones - can help to battle the symptoms of depression.'\n\n4. Reach out to friends and family\n\nThe expert also suggested building a routine of catch-ups with friends and family that would be easy to maintain throughout the winter months\n\nDr Thiyagarajan revealed that opening up to friends and family could also make a huge difference.\n\nHe said: 'If you\u2019re feeling the symptoms of SAD, it can be difficult to find the motivation to get in contact with friends and family to arrange plans.'\n\nHe pointed to building a calendar of appointments throughout the year, which would then be easy to maintain throughout the winter months.\n\nHe suggested: 'Make routine catch-ups with them a key part of your week, all year round \u2013 you can make them as simple as you like, even if it\u2019s a walk or a chat on the phone.'", "description": "Dr Arun Thiyagarajan, a Medical Director at Bupa UK, told FEMAIL how you could tell if you're suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder.
