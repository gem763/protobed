This young man decided something wasn't quite right,' Holland told RNZ.\n\nThe revelation comes shortly after Mason Pendrous (pictured) was found dead in his dorm room eight weeks after his death\n\nIt was at that point the friend climbed onto the roof and made his way into the room.\n\nHolland said he emailed Canterbury University about his son in August - one month before his body was found.\n\n'I just feel a bit frustrated that nobody, either at the university or at CLV chose after four or five weeks to chase him up. To find out why he'd not been to lectures, to find out why he'd not eaten.\n\n'They swipe in for food. He didn't swipe in. So at some point, an alarm bell must rise and say, 'hang on, he's not eaten here for two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, whatever it is'.'\n\nHe also said he though the campus living accommodation was run by the university and he only recently found out it was outsourced to Campus Living Villages.\n\nAccording to Mr Holland police are still carrying out investigations and it is not known how the young man died.\n\nHe also said it was unclear how long the body remained undiscovered saying he had been told nine weeks but this changed to eight weeks then four weeks.\n\nAnother similar incident was also revealed in October this year.\n\nA 31-year-old Australian man laid dead inside a New Zealand university dorm room for three days before his body was found.\n\nThe man, who has not been identified, was a PhD student at the Victoria University of Wellington and living in university housing for mature students when he died in January 2018.\n\nThe Australian man was living alone in a studio apartment, and only a third of the rooms in his residence were occupied at the time of his death, a spokeswoman for the university told Daily Mail Australia.\n\nVictoria University held a memorial for the man after his death, which his family attended.\n\nThe spokeswoman said the situation was devastating for both students and staff of Education House, who were asked not to put anything on social media following the finding, until the man's family had been notified.\n\n'Students who were at the hall at the time of the discovery were asked to be discreet and not post any comments on social media until the next of kin had been notified,' she said.\n\n'Once confirmation was received from the Police that the next of kin had been notified (received within a matter of hours), this messaging ceased.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Victoria University in Wellington said the find was devastating to other residents and staff, and family had attended a memorial at the campus (pictured) after being notified of his death\n\n'All University critical incident policies and procedures were followed and support was provided to staff, students and family impacted by the tragedy.\n\n'It was a very sad time for the University and particularly upsetting for staff and students at Education House.'\n\nJohnny O'Hagan Brebner told The Sydney Morning Herald other students at the university were not aware of the death until recently, and were shocked at the revelation.\n\nHe said as the news editor of the student magazine he was 'used to seeing and hearing and writing about bad stuff going on', but this news was on a different level.\n\n'This is a lot worse than I would've expected to see. It really concerns me' he said.\n\nHe said the university had a reputation for being 'very secretive' and that 'it wouldn't surprise me if they'd put pressure on [residential advisors] not to say anything'.\n\nThe spokeswoman said following the incident, a policy change was made to ensure junior staff were not exposed to such distressing scenes.\n\n'The University made one change to its processes as a result of the incident, to ensure only the onsite person in charge at a hall enters the room of a missing resident,' she said.\n\n'This was done to prevent more junior staff potentially being exposed to a distressing scene. We continuously review what we do in this area and respond to any recommendations from the Coroner.'", "description": "The body of 19-year-old Mason Pendrous was only found in September after a friend climbed onto the roof at the halls of residence and looked into his room.", "authors": ["Brett Lackey", "Hannah Moore For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/06/19477472-0-image-a-3_1570600787410.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
