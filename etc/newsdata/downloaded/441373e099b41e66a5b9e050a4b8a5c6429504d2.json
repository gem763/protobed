'She's moving things out this weekend. Harry's away in the West Indies.'\n\nI can disclose that, after moving in together last month, Sotheby's boss Lord Dalmeny and his high-octane lover, effervescent former model Martha Sitwell (both left, and right with Kim Murdoch), have parted company\n\n'Martha (right) split up with Harry a couple of weeks ago,' I'm told. 'She's moving things out this weekend. Harry's away in the West Indies'\n\nNeither Dalmeny, 51, nor Martha, 39, care to comment on this sad development, but the abruptness of the rupture has surprised and dismayed friends.\n\n'Harry's not happy about it,' one tells me, 'but I think that Martha may be even more upset.'\n\nThere was no indication that anything was amiss three weeks ago when the couple attended the British Film Institute's Luminous fundraising gala, held at the Roundhouse, north London, where Dalmeny conducted the auction with habitual showmanship in front of guests including Hugh Grant, Olivia Colman, Gemma Arterton, Danny Boyle, and Dame Joan Collins.\n\nNeither Dalmeny, 51, nor Martha, 39, (left with Gizzi Erskine and right) care to comment on this sad development, but the abruptness of the rupture has surprised and dismayed friends\n\nTheir appearance there seemed to indicate that all was well in the relationship.\n\nOne friend remarked that it appeared to 'work well', not least because neither was interested in having children.\n\nHarry Dalmeny, only son and heir of the 7th Earl of Rosebery \u2014 and great-grandson of the 5th Earl who famously achieved his three ambitions of owning a winner of the Derby, marrying an heiress and becoming Prime Minister \u2014 has four daughters and a son by his marriage to Caroline Daglish, from whom he parted five years ago. Martha seemed even less inclined to re-marry.\n\nTwo years ago she celebrated the end of her decade-long marriage to Sir George Sitwell, great nephew of poet Dame Edith Sitwell, by holding a 'divorce party'.\n\nShe subsequently denounced marriage as 'pure misery', alleging that it 'sucks all the energy from you, sucks your youth and all the fun from your life'.\n\nDavid Bowie's widow Iman\n\nAgeing? I don't give a damn, says Iman (64)\n\nDavid Bowie's widow Iman looked younger than her 64 years when she arrived at the Golden Heart Awards in New York this week to collect the accolade for Outstanding Community Service.\n\nThe Somali-American model, who turned heads in a copper-coloured leopard-print suit by Michael Kors, is not immune to insecurities, though.\n\n'I'm not a great fan of my legs, so anything long or pants is my friend,' she said, adding that her secret to ageing gracefully is to 'not give a damn'.\n\nJude Law's model daughter Iris\n\nIris Law's new look is a bit potty\n\nJude Law's model daughter Iris, star of the Burberry Beauty campaigns, risked her squeaky-clean reputation this week when she appeared to endorse marijuana.\n\nThe 18-year-old posted a snap of herself on social media wearing a green sticker of what looked like the Class-B drug on each cheek, before later insisting it was, in fact, a representation of a Japanese maple tree leaf that turns red in autumn.\n\nIris, whose picture was taken in Japan by her artist boyfriend, Jyrrel Roberts, provoked reaction from her friends who teased online that it still looked like 'dope'.\n\nCharles chats with U.S. eco champ Kerry\n\nFormer U.S. secretary of state John Kerry had a private meeting with Prince Charles at Clarence House this week.\n\nThe two men had much to talk about. Both have loud voices when it comes to the issue of climate change.\n\nThe Prince told world leaders in July that they have just 18 months to restore the balance of nature while Kerry, 75, has warned that humanity risks marching off a cliff unless governments take immediate action.\n\nHe memorably signed the UN's Paris Agreement on climate change in 2016 with his then-two-year-old granddaughter Isabelle on his lap.\n\nOutnumbered star quits his party lifestyle\n\nOutnumbered star Tyger Drew-Honey is the son of former porn stars Linzi Drew and Simon Honey (aka Ben Dover) \u2014 but at 23 he is already renouncing the pursuit of pleasure.\n\n'My goal in life used to be just to be the most successful actor and earn as much money as I can and be as hedonistic as I can,' says the actor.\n\n'All the while I was doing that, I was never really putting much work into my auditions or anything, which is madness, really.'\n\nThis new puritanism extends to some previous career choices.\n\n'I have to say I did a show called Celebs Go Dating.\n\n'The sad fact of life is that I had a mortgage to pay and I didn't have any other work at the time.'\n\nHe's barely been seen in public since abruptly cancelling a sell-out tour nearly two years ago due to 'unforeseen family circumstances'.\n\nBut spherical comic Peter Kay's bank balance continues to swell during his self-imposed exile.\n\nHis fortune, I can disclose, has risen by a tasty \u00a3339,259 in the past year \u2014 up to \u00a332,412,081.\n\nThe swag is held in his two companies, Good Night Vienna Productions and Hussein Traders.\n\nEnough to put a twinkle in Kay's eye as he waits for his show Phoenix Nights to come to the big screen early next year in aid of Cancer Research UK.\n\nAward-winning actor Sir Ian McKellen, 80, has one ambition to fulfil. 'I still harbour the dream that I might one day be in an on-stage musical,' he says.\n\n'It would be lovely, wouldn't it? To step out and sing a song. But I can't sing \u2014 so that's just a dream.'\n\nIt's two years since former It girl Tara Palmer-Tomkinson was found dead in her flat aged just 45.\n\nNovelist Santa Montefiore insists that despite her sister's drug addiction, she was happy and positive in the days before her death saying: 'She had plans, trips and had written a moving new song.'\n\nHow appropriate then that Santa, who is married to historian Simon Sebag Montefiore, should remember her sibling by listening to an old album she made.\n\n'I love listening to my late sister's CD, Flawed,' she tells me.\n\n'I like hearing her voice.'", "description": "SEBASTIAN SHAKESPEARE: They promised to become one of London society's most dazzling couples.
