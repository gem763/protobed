This is not the time or place to talk about consequences. But this is now, regrettably, a pattern of behavior that is disrespectful and does not serve anyone well \u2014including the student who acted inappropriately and embarrassed himself and his school,\u201d the superintendent said.\n\nThe school official went on to say that the situation will be dealt with \u201cat school\u201d but also added that parents should speak to their \u201cown children in an age-appropriate manner about our expectation of how we treat people.\u201d\n\nClouet told BuzzFeed News that the student was sent back home during the trip shortly after the incident.\n\nWhile the superintendent told the publication that he was uncertain about whether the incident was racially-motivated, he said that \"too often incidents are covered over by claiming it's only a joke.\"\n\nIn a since-deleted tweet, Dina Marks, the principal at the Connecticut middle school, called the incident \u201can act of stupidity, disinterest, & immaturity, completely inappropriate,\u201d but added she did not believe it was \"racially motivated against that person.\"\n\n\"Our kids are not bad people,\" she also tweeted, according to BuzzFeed. \"We are all pretty sad tonight.\"\n\nMarks\u2019 profile also appears to have since been deleted as of Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe incident prompted backlash from a local civil rights leader who told the Hartford Courant who said he believes the incident amounted to more than just horseplay given where it occurred.\n\nGreg Johnson, the president of the Ansonia Valley NAACP, pointed out that the boy \u201cdidn\u2019t spit on anyone at the Washington Monument or the Lincoln Memorial.\u201d\n\n\u201cA total and complete lack of respect and one of the most degrading acts one can commit against another,\u201d he also said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s an embarrassment not only to Shelton, but to Connecticut.\u201d", "description": "A middle school in Connecticut is capturing widespread attention after officials said one of its students spit on a black visitor to the National Museum of African American History and Culture during a recent class trip.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/smithsonian_national_museum_african_american_history_culture_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
