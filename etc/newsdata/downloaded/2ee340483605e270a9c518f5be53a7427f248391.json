Notably, women in this generation are less likely to want to be constantly connected, compared to millennial women: 66% of Gen Z women reported that they wanted to be \"always reachable,\" compared to 71% of millennial counterparts. GfK suggests that this could be attributed to \"technology fatigue,\" in which a generation that grew up constantly connected seeks to loosen ties to technology.\n\nAlthough they are less likely to want constant online connection, 61% of Gen Z women also reported that they have trouble taking breaks from technology, indicating that for many, they are always connected to the internet, even if they don't necessarily want to be, but it's difficult for them to give up. In comparison, only 41% of all women reported difficulty taking breaks, and 49% of millennial women reported the same.\n\nDespite difficulty getting offline, Gen Z women are overwhelmingly pessimistic about the impact of technology on society: only 34%, or about one-third, said that they were optimistic, 15 points lower than women as a whole.\n\n\"Women and moms of Gen Z depend on apps to juggle their many roles in life - but they also know the downsides of tech too well,\" Jola Burnett, vice president of Consumer Life, said in the press release.\n\nIncreased exposure to and awareness of the darker sides of technology could be responsible for the pessimism Gen Z women feel: 39% said that they are \"always concerned about [their] safety and security,\" and 19% are worried about personal information getting into the wrong hands, which is higher than all women as a group. This could also be the result of gender-based harassment many women face online, and the ability of new technology to make this harassment worse, such as using deepfakes to make non-consensual pornography.\n\nGiven these results, Gen Z women seem confused about the role of technology in their lives. It is more ingrained in their lives than those of other generations, yet they also know it well enough to be wary of potential downsides.", "description": "Gen Z women are less optimistic about technology's ability to positively impact them than millennials, according to a new study.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2840/22b1207df54b43c28c49b777ba38d0f0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
