In a post, Medium\u2019s Emma Smith describes reading time as \u201ca closer measure of quality and resonance with readers.\u201d After all, it reflects the interest and behavior of all readers, not \u201cnot just the ones who remember to \ud83d\udc4f.\u201d\n\nAccording to Smith\u2019s post, Medium has now paid out more than $6 million total to 30,000 writers.\n\nWhen CEO Ev Williams explained the partner model to me shortly after it launched in 2017, he described it as an evolving formula that incorporated claps and reading time, but now it sounds like reading time has won out as the metric that matters.\n\n\u201cWe believe in reading time because it represents the core value that our readers receive from Medium,\u201d Smith writes. \u201cIt may not be a perfect measure of value, but we find that it\u2019s a powerful proxy.\u201d\n\nTo be more specific, Smith says Medium is measuring and determining compensation based on active reading time, so if someone keeps the window open when they step away for a few minutes, that shouldn\u2019t count.\n\nSmith also says Medium is looking at reading time in two ways \u2014 there\u2019s the more straightforward measurement of \u201chow long members spend reading your story\u201d (this include readers who find your story and subscribe in the next 30 days), but also the percentage of their total reading time that members spend on your stories, which is meant to \u201csupport authors who write about unique topics and connect with loyal readers.\u201d\n\nIn addition to changing the way earnings are calculated, Medium is also changing the frequency with which they\u2019re calculated, from weekly to daily. And the reader data that Medium shares with writers will include \u201cnew metrics to explain your earnings.\u201d\n\nDespite all these changes, Smith notes that claps aren\u2019t going away, and that they still matter: \u201cClaps will remain a great way for readers to support stories they love. When your readers clap, they\u2019ll boost your stories to a wider audience. And as more people read, you\u2019ll earn.\u201d", "description": "Medium is announcing significant changes to its Partner Program, where subscribers pay for access to exclusive content, and the revenue gets split with writers.
