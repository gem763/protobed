After a three-year run as the top choice for baby girls, from 2011 to 2013, Sophia fell to third place in 2014 and 2015 and fourth in 2016 and fifth in 2017 behind Emma, Olivia and Ava.\n\nTo find out how popular your name was when you were born\u2014and how it has fared since then\u2014enter your gender, birth year and first name into this interactive. We\u2019ll tell you which of eight categories your name fits into based on your birth year, like \u201ctrendsetter,\u201d \u201cMr. or Ms. Popular,\u201d or even a \u201csnowflake\u201d\u2014a name that was never common.\n\nThose who named their child \u201cSophia\u201d in 2016 are just one example of a common psychological phenomenon in naming children: Parents often believe they are ahead of the curve with a name, or at least not riding the bandwagon, when in fact thousands of other parents have come to the same conclusion.\n\nAs the University of Virginia social psychologist Timothy D. Wilson wrote in his book Strangers to Ourselves, not even psychologists who study these trends are immune to name crazes. He writes that when he and his wife chose to name their son Christopher, \u201cit seemed like a pleasing but not-too-fadish choice.\u201d They soon learned it was among the most popular boy names of the year.\n\nFull disclosure: Wilson and his wife, Deirdre Smith, are this reporter\u2019s parents.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe Social Security Administration publishes all names that appear at least five times in a given year. This interactive includes every name that passed that threshold in at least 50 different years going back to 1900. To determine categories, TIME first determined the \u201clocal maxima\u201d for each name\u2014times when it peaked in popularity, even if that peak was not the all-time highest level for a name. (Many names peak two or three times over the course of over 100 years.) We did not count small peaks or ones that occurred in the course of a name\u2019s overall downward trend.\n\nNames are considered popular if they occur within two years of a peak year. \u201cClassic\u201d names are those that most recently peaked more than 20 years ago. \u201cSnowflake\u201d names are those that never surpassed 0.01% of all names in their peak year. \u201cComeback kid\u201d names must have a least 50 years between peaks.\n\nWrite to Chris Wilson at chris.wilson@time.com.", "description": "This interactive will tell you if your name was a trendsetter, a bandwagon choice or after its time, based on new federal data for 2015", "authors": ["Chris Wilson"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/baby-names.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
