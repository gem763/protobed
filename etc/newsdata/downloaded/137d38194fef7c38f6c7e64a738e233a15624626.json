After six years with the massive tech company, Kazi parlayed the knowledge he gained at Facebook into launching his own company, Threads, an inclusive workplace-communication tool. Threads launched from stealth with a Series A funding round of $10.5 million led by Sequoia earlier this year, which also included a 50-50 gender cap table, something that the company strongly believes every organization should actively pursue in order to innovate and grow.\n\nKazi believes that in order to continue to foster innovation, companies need to encourage more diversity and inclusion from the get-go. He cofounded Threads with the premise of fostering communication and collaboration between all people in the workplace, opening doors for everyone to share ideas and be heard.\n\nTwo and a half years after deciding to go the startup route, the successful CEO and cofounder shared with Business Insider three reasons why he believes working for a major player in the technology industry just might be the best business education you can get \u2014 and not just because it's a path that pays you while you learn and doesn't cost upward of $70,000 to $80,000 a year like going to a top business school would (and that's just for tuition!).\n\nReason No. 1: It helps you 'experience the pain' and learn to overcome it\n\nKazi said he had many experiences that helped him grow while on Facebook's product-management team. Whether he was learning that \"most toxic collaborations come from people being ignorant, not malicious,\" how anger is \"just how people get to be afraid without seeming weak,\" or how to ship products under \"unbelievable\" deadlines, each lesson was preceded by \"humbling experiences of me making mistakes, causing thrash, having incredible mentors who helped me improve, swallowing my pride, and getting better each and every day.\"\n\nThese eye-opening moments, he added, won't necessarily come from a classroom setting; he emphasized that the insights he gained at the tech giant could be more powerful than what people generally studied in business school. \"You can't fabricate that pain and growth; you just have to go out there and do it.\"\n\nWhile Kazi didn't choose the route of an MBA, he has interviewed and managed people who do have the degree. \"If the choice is between getting an MBA or doing a startup for two years [that fails], I would bet on the person who did the latter to join my company to work on product,\" Kazi said. \"Growth hurts and is painful. The sooner you start the process, the faster you'll start learning.\"\n\nReason No. 2: It's a better and faster education for those looking to work in tech anyway\n\nWhile Kazi said that working at a large company or startup was not necessarily better in all regards, he identified it as the best option if you wanted to end up in the product space \u2014 or start your own tech company.\n\n\"This is for a few reasons,\" he said. \"You often learn by doing, not reading. There's no right way to build a product or a team, just a bunch of wrong ways you need to work through.\"\n\nKazi added that because taking on a product-management role in a tech firm was \"more of an art than a science,\" the experience could help you develop your skills better than book learning could, which is why many tech giants, Facebook included, invest in product-management starter programs. \"You have to play to your strengths, learn about yourself and the type of leader you need to become, and then figure out your best style based on that,\" he said. \"You won't do that as quickly in a classroom.\"\n\nKazi worked at Facebook for six years as a product manager. Courtesy of Threads\n\nWhile interviewing product-management candidates at Facebook, Kazi chatted with plenty of MBA candidates who were a great fit for the role. But he noticed a discrepancy between applicants with industry experience and those with the degree alone.\n\n\"Throughout that process, there was a clear difference between people who tried building their own products or companies and failed [compared with] people who just took the classes,\" Kazi said. \"If you've already gone through it, you have a better internal barometer to figure things out and ultimately make sure you build something people want, get it out on time, and that your team wants to work with you again once it's all done.\"\n\nReason No. 3: It gives you a crash course in managing people and running a business\n\nIn terms of leadership, Kazi pointed to his Facebook training as something that helped him understand the importance of culture and chemistry when building a team, and how to use narratives, visions, and storytelling to communicate effectively.\n\n\"I learned how a leader isn't a visionary that stands in front of the crowd, but a catalyst that focuses on building systems and environments that help their team be their best selves,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, I learned how to build great teams with strong personalities, how to give those teams an environment where they can do their best work, how to set a vision to help the team have an impact and realize their potential, and how to evaluate markets and solutions to make sure that what we're building actually matters.\"\n\nIn other words, when it comes to building, creating, and performing in a business, he learned what really matters.", "description": "Rousseau Kazi worked as a product manager at Facebook before launching his company, Threads, an inclusive workplace-communication tool.", "authors": ["Robin Madell"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8a98e82e22af1ab97e02a2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
