(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nThere\u2019s suddenly an air of finality to the roiling story about an intelligence community whistleblower who filed a complaint against President Trump\u2019s administration. While a week ago news organizations were scrambling to uncover the nature of the complaint, we now have the complaint in hand. We also have a rough transcript of a call at the center of the complaint, in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden. That, it would seem, is that.\n\nExcept, of course, it isn\u2019t. There remain a number of important, unanswered questions about the entire situation, some of which stem from the released documents themselves. We\u2019ve outlined several of the most important below.\n\nBefore getting to those, it\u2019s useful to summarize what is known. We know that Trump and Zelensky spoke on July 25. For months earlier, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, had been trying to gin up evidence supporting his theory that Biden had called for the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor in early 2016 to protect his son Hunter. That effort had included outreach to officials in Ukraine and was part of what Trump asked of Zelensky on the call.\n\nOn the call, Trump was direct, responding to Zelensky\u2019s ingratiations with specific requests for actions from the Ukrainian government. Zelensky thanked Trump for aid the United States had provided, though the administration had halted another round of aid before the call.\n\nAfter the call, according to the whistleblower, records of the call were moved to a highly secure storage system within the administration to keep them private. The whistleblower became aware of the conversation and filed a complaint focused broadly on the administration\u2019s and Giuliani\u2019s efforts to influence Ukraine in early August.\n\nWas aid to Ukraine withheld as leverage over Zelensky?\n\nBefore the release of the whistleblower complaint, there were intriguing hints that Trump may have directly used American aid to Ukraine as leverage over Zelensky. Some observers suggested that there may have been an explicit quid pro quo suggested by Trump \u2014 investigate Biden and then get the cash \u2014 though that wasn\u2019t generally the understanding in reported coverage.\n\nIt is still an outstanding question, though. Not the question of an explicit offer of quid pro quo between Trump and Zelensky, since that\u2019s not indicated in the available transcript. But it\u2019s still not clear why the White House stopped the aid in the first place.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to assume that the Ukrainian government is well aware of when it is expected to and when it does receive large aid payments from the United States. It\u2019s not clear if there was a payment expected in the period before the call that never arrived. If there were, of course, it might prompt Zelensky to be more ingratiating than he would otherwise be inclined to be. It might also prompt Zelensky to inquire about the aid payment, which he didn\u2019t.\n\nOne underappreciated point is that Trump was demonstrably aware of Giuliani\u2019s debunked theory about the Bidens \u2014 that Joe Biden had threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine to oust a prosecutor threatening his son \u2014 long before the Zelensky call and before the aid to Ukraine was halted. He mentioned it in a Fox News interview on May 19; as of four days later, the aid was still on track.\n\nIn other words, Trump at that point believed that aid to Ukraine had been used as a point of leverage in the past.\n\nTo what extent was a presidential meeting used as leverage?\n\nReading the rough transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call, The Post\u2019s Aaron Blake picked out an intriguing subtext. Zelensky appears to have been quite eager to arrange a meeting between himself and Trump \u2014 a meeting that Trump had been slow to confirm. Even when the two met this week, Zelensky raised the issue, joking \u2014 with some tension \u2014 that Trump had invited him but forgotten to identify a date.\n\nIt\u2019s a reminder that in interactions between the president of the United States and other foreign leaders, there are many levers that can be pulled. One of the critiques of Trump\u2019s interactions with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is that Trump gave Kim the valuable gift of a personal meeting. Zelensky was not so lucky \u2014 to his apparent frustration.\n\nIn other words, Trump may have been leveraging the institutional power of the presidency to his personal benefit \u2014 undermining a possible 2020 opponent \u2014 in a way that didn\u2019t involve money at all.\n\nWhich other communication was moved to the secure storage system?\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s complaint comes in two parts. The first is a letter outlining the allegations in general, written so that it contained no classified information. The second part contains classified addendums, supplementary information bolstering the unclassified letter.\n\nIn the unclassified letter, the whistleblower described what they\u2019d been told about how the White House handled records of the call.\n\n\u201c[T]he transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature,\u201d the whistleblower wrote. \u201cOne White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.\u201d\n\nIn the classified appendix, the whistleblower added an important point: \u201cAccording to White House officials I spoke with, this was \u2018not the first time\u2019 under this Administration that a Presidential transcript was placed into this codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive \u2014 rather than national security sensitive \u2014 information.\u201d\n\nThe question that emerges is obvious. What else got shunted to that highly secure system, and why?\n\nHow complete is the transcript?\n\nThe Post has been assiduous in describing the transcript of the July 25 call released by the White House as \u201crough\u201d for the simple reason that it is. The transcript itself notes that it is not a verbatim reconstruction of the call. The document instead \u201crecords the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty Officers and [National Security Council] policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place,\u201d according to a footnote on the first page.\n\nIn other words, Trump and Zelensky may have discussed things or made comments not included in the rough transcript. Those things may simply have been minor things such as the use of different tenses or trivial asides. The differences may be more significant.\n\nWhat was redacted from the whistleblower complaint?\n\nThere is one section of redactions in the released whistleblower complaint. A block of classified material linked to the letter\u2019s fourth section \u2014 the section dealing with the \u201c[c]ircumstances leading up to the 25 July Presidential phone call\u201d \u2014 has been obscured, as has an apparently related footnote.\n\nThe redaction may be related to classified intelligence-gathering centered on Ukraine. That it was included in the complaint, though, suggests that it has relevance to the issue of Trump\u2019s efforts to push Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. What that relevance might be is unknown.\n\nHow much was the State Department involved in deploying Giuliani?\n\nGiuliani\u2019s role in the Ukraine effort is a substantial one. He\u2019s mentioned repeatedly in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint as advocating for a probe of the Bidens. As Trump\u2019s personal attorney, there\u2019s an implication \u2014 not explicitly stated \u2014 that Giuliani is freelancing on Trump\u2019s behalf.\n\nGiuliani, though, claims that he was acting on behalf of the administration itself. On Thursday, he tweeted an image of a text-message exchange with Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker, a State Department employee. In that exchange, Volker appears to be introducing Giuliani to Zelensky adviser Andriy Yermak. Giuliani and Yermak met in Madrid in early August, a meeting that the whistleblower claims was \u201cdirect follow-up\u201d to the Trump-Zelensky call. During the call, Zelensky told Trump that he\u2019d welcome Giuliani to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe whistleblower falsely alleges that I was operating on my own,\u201d Giuliani said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cIngraham Angle\u201d Thursday night. \u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t operating on my own. I went to meet Mr. Zelensky\u2019s aide at the request of the State Department. Fifteen memos make that clear. I didn\u2019t know Mr. Yermak. \u2026 Volker said, would you meet with him, it\u2019d be helpful to us, we really want you to do it.\u201d\n\nWhat the whistleblower alleges isn\u2019t that Giuliani is acting on his own so much as that Giuliani was freelancing on his message, sharing priorities with Ukrainian officials that were in conflict with the message coming from the administration. The implication is that it was an explicit manifestation of the long-standing metaphorical divide in the Trump White House: How Trump operates vs. the operation of the rest of the government.\n\nBut Giuliani\u2019s claims raise the important question above. To what extent was the State Department involved in what Giuliani was doing? Was he reaching out to Ukrainian officials with the endorsement of State? Was he leveraging State to make connections that facilitated his narrower agenda?\n\nThe whistleblower acknowledges interactions between Volker and Giuliani. Beginning in mid-May, the whistleblower writes, \u201cState Department officials, including Ambassadors Volker and [Ambassador to the European Union Gordon] Sondland, had spoken with Mr. Giuliani in an attempt to \u2018contain the damage\u2019 to U.S. national security.\u201d Volker and Sondland also traveled to Kiev after the July 25 call, the whistleblower claims, to \u201c[provide] advice to the Ukrainian leadership about how to \u2018navigate\u2019 the demands that the President had made of Mr. Zelensky.\u201d\n\nWhy is former prosecutor Viktor Shokin so adamant about Biden\u2019s involvement in his firing?\n\nAt the center of the Giuliani-Trump effort is this claim that Biden threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine to force the ouster of then-general prosecutor Viktor Shokin. Subsequent reporting has indicated that there was no link between that effort, which was supported by others in the administration and by other international actors, and Hunter Biden\u2019s role as a board member of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nThe Giuliani-Trump theory is that Shokin was investigating that company, Burisma, though there\u2019s no evidence that such an investigation was active at the time, that Hunter Biden would be implicated in any way or that Biden\u2019s motivation for calling for Shokin\u2019s ouster was related to Burisma. Our fact-checkers have been over this repeatedly.\n\nNonetheless, Shokin insists that Burisma was the reason for his firing. In a sworn affidavit filed earlier this month and obtained by the Hill\u2019s John Solomon \u2014 another central figure in the Giuliani-Trump-Ukraine universe \u2014 Shokin claims that his firing occurred \u201csolely on the demands of the U.S. Vice President, Joe Biden, because [he] refused to cease [his] probe into Burisma (in which Biden had significant interests)\". He\u2019s claimed something similar before.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if there is legal weight to the affidavit (if, that is, he faces perjury penalties if it is knowingly inaccurate) and it\u2019s certainly true that he has an ax to grind with Biden (per his own admission). He is, however, the primary dissenter from the weight of evidence suggesting that Biden\u2019s call for his firing was objective in nature.\n\nNow what?\n\nThis is perhaps the most interesting question. It\u2019s also the only one for which we\u2019re guaranteed to eventually get an answer.", "description": "Reviewing a hectic week.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/sjcMCoOofOZpU6K6ekS5TYU8ZnA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6DZTWFXBBQI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
