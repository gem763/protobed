Although it does have a big act to follow after the success of Hustlers\u2026\n\nThe romcom, based on Barry Cosby\u2019s graphic novel of the same name, also stars Sarah Silverman, Jameela Jamil and Maluma, and has been filming in NYC this month.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of train to carry (Picture: Jose Perez / SplashNews.com)\n\nMaybe Jen will downsize for her own wedding (Picture: Jose Perez / SplashNews.com)\n\nJennifer plays a popstar who marries a random fan (Picture: Jose Perez / SplashNews.com)\n\nAnd it looks like they\u2019re sparing no expense on the costume department, as Jennifer\u2019s bridal gown was no off-the-rack creation.\n\nThe glitzy ballgown featured metallic detailing on the overskirt, while the main skirt was made of tulle and featured a huge train.\n\nJennifer seemed to be struggling with the weight of the dress \u2013 and it didn\u2019t help that was she was carrying a fur stole with her.\n\nThe Hustlers star is preparing to get married to Alex, 44, next year, with Jen insisting the details haven\u2019t been ironed out yet.\n\nAlex popped the question in March (Picture: EPA)\n\nThe Get Right singer told Entertainment Tonight: \u2018We\u2019re talking about it, but we don\u2019t have any firm plans\u2026and we\u2019re talking about a lot of places [to get married in], but I don\u2019t know yet.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, on an Instagram video, JLo said: \u2018I\u2019d like a big wedding. And I\u2019d like to get married in a church this time. I\u2019ve never been married in a church.\u2019\n\nThe star has been married three times in the past \u2013 to Ojani Noa from 1997 until 1998, to Cris Judd (2001-2003) and to Marc Anthony (2004-2014), with whom she shares 11-year-old twins Maximilian and Emme.\n\nJennifer was also famously engaged to Ben Affleck, although the couple called off their wedding indefinitely a day before the nuptials were due to take place and split up the following year.\n\nThe Love Don\u2019t Cost A Thing star also dated Diddy and former backup dancer Casper Smart.\n\nHowever, Jen \u2013 who is set to headline the Super Bowl halftime show next year with Shakira \u2013 now understands marriage, thanks to Alex.\n\nShe told The Sun: \u2018I think I\u2019ve understood that marriage takes a lot more than just falling in love and sharing a home.\n\n\u2018Alex and I had a connection from the very beginning and maybe could see a future for ourselves.\n\n\u2018We talked about it a few times. But when he proposed it was a \u00adsurprise for me. We love each other, love being around each other and have a lot of respect for each other.
