The Judge Had to Explain Those Words to Him.", "language": "en", "text": "Want the best of VICE News straight to your inbox? Sign up here.\n\nA 9-year-old boy accused of setting fire to his family\u2019s trailer while they slept could barely understand the charges brought against him at his first hearing Monday.\n\nProsecutors charged the boy, who hasn\u2019t been named because of his age, with five counts of first-degree murder earlier this month for the deadly fire, which took place in April. But at his hearing, the boy struggled to make sense of what those words meant, according to the Chicago Tribune.\n\n\u201cWhat don\u2019t you understand?\u201d Judge Charles Feeny asked the boy after reading his charges during his Monday arraignment at the Woodford County juvenile court.\n\n\u201cWhat I did,\u201d the boy told the judge.\n\nThe judge then had to explain each charge in language a 9-year-old could understand. At one point, the boy\u2019s attorney said the boy didn\u2019t understand what \u201calleged\u201d meant.\n\n\u201cIt means someone accuses you,\u201d the judge explained. \u201cIf I accuse you of wearing a purple shirt \u2026 I allege you\u2019re wearing a purple shirt. Is that true?\u201d\n\nShortly afterward, the boy\u2019s attorney asked the judge to explain what \u201carson\u201d means.\n\nThe fire took the lives of the boy\u2019s great-grandmother, his 2-year-old sister, baby sister, 2-year-old cousin, and his mother\u2019s boyfriend. Only the boy and his mother, 27-year-old Katie Alwood, made it out alive.\n\n\u201cHe does have a good heart,\u201d Alwood told the Chicago Tribune earlier this month after her son was charged. She added that he suffers from schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and ADHD. \u201cHe helped feed his brother and sister, helped teach them how to walk. Yes, he should be punished, but he needs mental help, that\u2019s what he needs.\u201d\n\nAlwood, who lost custody of her son after the fire, also said he would bring food to a memorial his family set up for the people who died in a fire because he thought his siblings would come back to eat it.\n\nThe boy is too young to be sent to a juvenile detention center if he\u2019s found guilty, but he does face probation. If he violates the terms of his probation, though, he can be sentenced to county detention once he\u2019s 10 years old and sent to a state juvenile prison when he turns 13, according to the Tribune.\n\n\u201cIt was a heavy decision,\u201d Woodford County State\u2019s Attorney Gregory Minger told the Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s charging a very young person with one of the most serious crimes we have. But I just think it needs to be done at this point, for finality.\u201d\n\nThe boy left the courthouse in tears, CBS News reported.\n\nCover image: This photo taken April 7, 2019, shows a fence and caution tape surrounding a trailer home that was destroyed by fire in the Timberline Mobile Home Park northeast of Goodfield.
