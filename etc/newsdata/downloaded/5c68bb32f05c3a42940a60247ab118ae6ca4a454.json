AP\n\nAndy Dick has pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor count of sexual battery for allegedly groping his Lyft driver, his attorney Daniel Kapelovitz confirmed to USA TODAY.\n\nThe alleged groping incident took place in West Hollywood, Calif., on April 12, 2018, according to a press release from the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office.\n\nThe comedian, 53, was arraigned Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court and faces up to 180 days in county jail if convicted, the release says.\n\nKapelovitz called the allegations against his client \"completely baseless.\"\n\n\"Our understanding was that the District Attorney realized that this case had no merit, and that is why the case was never filed,\" he said in a statement to USA TODAY Friday. \"Then, almost a year and a half later, we learn from TMZ that there was an outstanding warrant based on a misdemeanor complaint filed just prior to the statute of limitations running out. This case should be dismissed outright. If not, we look forward to fighting these false accusations.\"\n\nKapelovitz added Dick's next court date is set for a pretrial hearing on Nov. 4.\n\nMore: Comedian Andy Dick says he was attacked, left unconscious in New Orleans\n\nAndy Dick has been charged with groping a driver from a ride-hailing service.
