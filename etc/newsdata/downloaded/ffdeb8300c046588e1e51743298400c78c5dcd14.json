Thousands gathered in the surrounding streets chanting: \u201cThe streets will always be ours!\u201d\n\nFour hours after the first skirmishes, Via Laietana was a battleground strewn with rubble. Police struggled to control the situation, firing rubber bullets, teargas and later in the night, a water cannon was deployed against demonstrators for first time since it was bought from Israel in 1994.\n\nDemonstrators dispersed into the adjoining streets where they set up barricades and fought cat-and-mouse battles with the police. At least 35 people were treated for injuries and there were 10 arrests.\n\nThe Spanish government said a group of about 400 protesters was attacking police and warned anyone engaged in similar acts that they faced six-year prison terms.\n\nAuthorities announced late on Friday that 207 officers had been injured in the unrest. Nearly 800 bins were set on fire and 107 police vehicles were damaged.\n\nThe escalating violence came at the end of a general strike and amid significant disruption caused by the huge and peaceful marches.\n\nAccording to Barcelona police, about 525,000 people congregated in the city, many of them having marched there from around Catalonia. Earlier, marchers entering Barcelona found themselves pelted with stones as they passed through the working-class neighbourhood of Santa Coloma de Gramenet.\n\nTheir presence brought the city to a standstill before a huge demonstration began at 5pm local time. The entrance to the Catalan capital\u2019s most famous landmark \u2013 the Sagrada Familia church \u2013 was blocked by pro-independence protesters and 57 flights were cancelled at Barcelona-El Prat airport.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Riot police officers run past a burning barricade in Barcelona.

The group was behind Monday\u2019s attempts to occupy Barcelona airport. The shutdown left many protesters milling aimlessly in the absence of instructions.\n\nPeaceful protests, which have long been the hallmark of the pro-independence movement, have been eclipsed this week by violent unrest and running battles between protesters and police.\n\nFriday\u2019s violence surpassed that seen on Thursday, when pro-independence supporters clashed with police and rightwing groups in skirmishes that lasted into the early hours.\n\nAfter another large demonstration broke up, protesters fought police, throwing stones and at least one petrol bomb in an apparent attempt to reach the seat of the Spanish government in the city. A clothing shop was set on fire and a bank vandalised.\n\nQ&A What do the lengthy Catalan sentences mean? Show Hide Despite the long sentences handed down by the supreme court on 14 October, some of the nine leaders convicted of sedition and misuse of public funds could soon be eligible to apply for \u201csemi-liberty\u201d, allowing them out of prison on a regular basis.\n\nJosep Mar\u00eda Tamarit, a professor of criminal law at the Open University of Catalonia, said that in cases where a sentence of five years or more was handed out, a court could stipulate \u201cthat half the sentence has to be served before prisoners are eligible for semi-liberty\u201d. However, the supreme court turned down prosecutors\u2019 request for such an order in the Catalan case. That means that Jordi S\u00e0nchez and Jordi Cuixart \u2013 who have now served two years in pre-trial detention \u2013 could apply to be allowed out on licence as soon as they have served a quarter of their sentences, which would be in January next year. Oriol Junqueras, who received the longest sentence \u2013 13 years \u2013 would have to wait about 15 months before applying. Those convicted can complain to Spain\u2019s constitutional court and then put their case before the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. The Spanish government has the power to issue pardons if they are requested and if the person convicted shows repentance for their crime. However, such a move would have profound political consequences. Opponents of Spain\u2019s acting prime minister, the socialist leader Pedro S\u00e1nchez, would accused him of bowing before the separatists were his government to even consider a pardon.

Numerous injuries were reported.\n\nThe supreme court\u2019s decision to jail the nine leaders for sedition and misuse of public funds over their roles in the failed push for independence has provoked uproar among many Catalans.\n\nAmong those taking part in the march was Anna Parella, a hospital worker from the coastal town of Calella. She had joined the march with colleagues to call for independence and the release of the jailed leaders.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have joined us as we\u2019ve gone along and the mood is really nice and festive,\u201d said Parella.\n\nShe said the marchers were all peaceful but added that some people had grown sick of the situation and begun to go about things the wrong way. \u201cI\u2019m against the violence and we can\u2019t have people starting to think we\u2019re all violent,\u201d she said. \u201cOur calls will lose their force if they do.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Anna Parella, second left, with colleagues who were marching to Barcelona to call for independence and the release of the jailed Catalan leaders.

His extradition hearing has been scheduled for 29 October.\n\nCatalonia\u2019s pro-independence regional president, Quim Torra, has been criticised for being slow to condemn the violence \u2013 and for calling for civil disobedience while sending in Catalan riot police to restore order.\n\nSpeaking on Friday morning, Spain\u2019s interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, said 16 people had been arrested overnight and 10 police officers injured. He repeated the government\u2019s assertion that while people had a right to protest, any violence would be dealt with firmly.\n\nAsked about reports that violent groups from the Basque country, France and Germany were planning to travel to Catalonia to take part in any forthcoming disturbances, he said such participation had already been anticipated by the authorities.\n\n\u201cWe know that these kinds of radical, violent people \u2013 people with varying ideologies \u2013 have been present in Catalonia, particularly Barcelona,\u201d he said. \u201cThey tend to turn up for the kind of events we\u2019re seeing in Barcelona.\u201d\n\nReports have already emerged of some of the violent protesters speaking neither Catalan nor Spanish.", "description": "Protesters set fire to bins and chant \u2018The streets will always be ours\u2019 in fifth night of rioting", "authors": ["Stephen Burgen", "Sam Jones", "Carles Puigdemont"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb1f31a6534acf96f9bc55c10d5b2aa0d3d6b426/0_124_3038_1823/master/3038.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=753fb6cb3efad537039d715fe7a6d463", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
