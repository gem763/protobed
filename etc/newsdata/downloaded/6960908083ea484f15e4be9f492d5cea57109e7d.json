The Patriots win, the young guy puts up bad stats and there is general confusion and dismay as it all plays out.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing ghosts,\u201d New York Jets QB Sam Darnold said of Belichick\u2019s defense during his recent 33-0 loss to New England. He isn\u2019t alone.\n\nBelichick has now faced the top four picks in that 2018 draft \u2014 Baker Mayfield (No. 1 pick, Cleveland), Darnold (No. 3, Jets), Josh Allen (No. 7, Buffalo) and Josh Rosen (No. 10 Arizona, but traded to Miami, where he faced the Patriots in relief).\n\nHe\u2019s 6-0 against them, by a scoring margin of 181-38.\n\nNow comes No. 5, Lamar Jackson of Baltimore, who went last among the group and last in the first round, but has delivered the greatest impact on the league.\n\nThe 5-2 Ravens are hosting the Sunday night clash and pose the biggest threat thus far to the Pats, who have cruised through a soft early schedule. Much of that is because of Jackson, which has not gone unnoticed by Belichick.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a problem,\u201d Belichick said on Monday. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely a problem.\u201d\n\nIf the Patriots were playing Foxborough High School this week, Belichick would be declaring the quarterback a \u201cproblem,\u201d so there is no need to get carried away with what he says. It is what Jackson does that is undeniable.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Heisman Trophy winner out of the University of Louisville has electrified the league with his dual-threat ability, throwing for 1,650 yards and running for 576.\n\nBelichick has long been masterful at throwing confusing coverages and unexpected blitzes at quarterbacks, especially young ones. New England has won 21 consecutive games against first- or second-year starters, the longest such streak in NFL history.\n\nAgainst the Pats, the 2018 draft class has completed just 48.8 percent of its passes (87 of 178) for an average of just 152.3 yards a game. They\u2019ve combined for 11 interceptions and 17 sacks against two touchdowns.\n\n(Paul Rosales/Yahoo Sports illustration)\n\nJackson is a bit different. He arrives with the best team of the group (although Mayfield\u2019s Browns aren\u2019t lacking in offensive weapons). He also doesn\u2019t need to stand in the pocket and try to figure out what Belichick is throwing at him. He can just tuck it and run like few quarterbacks in league history.\n\n\u201cHe leads the team in rushing,\u201d Belichick said.\n\nJackson has thrown for 17 touchdowns in his career (in 14 starts) but also added eight rushing scores.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very fast and he\u2019s definitely a hard guy to handle,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cHe\u2019s fast and that\u2019s a really big problem. A lot of times he just outruns people. I mean, he\u2019s got good moves, too. I\u2019m not saying [he doesn\u2019t], but a lot of times he just outruns people with his speed.\u201d\n\nJackson struggled throwing in Sunday\u2019s 30-16 victory over Seattle. He more than made up for it by running for 116 yards on 14 carries and a TD. The week before, he ran for 152 yards and a TD on 19 carries while also going 21-of-33 for 236 yards to help defeat Cincinnati.\n\nLike all young quarterbacks, he can see ghosts. In his case, he can also just run away from them.\n\n\u201cCatching him is an issue, especially when he keeps the ball,\u201d Belichick continued. \u201cA lot of times he\u2019s running against a defensive end and the ends just aren\u2019t fast enough.\u201d\n\nBelichick will no doubt design something to try to stop Jackson. Watching him on the sideline when New England is playing young quarterbacks (any quarterback, but especially inexperienced ones) is to sense a shred of joy.\n\nIt\u2019s a mental mismatch, experience overruling athleticism.\n\nJackson, like the rest of them, was born in the late 1990s (1997, to be exact). Belichick has been in the league since 1975 and learned the game earlier than that from his father, Steve, who was a longtime assistant at the United States Naval Academy.\n\nCounting his time as Bill Parcells\u2019 defensive coordinator for the New York Giants and Patriots, Belichick has been involved in 12 of the 53 Super Bowls ever played (22.6 percent). He\u2019s won eight overall, including three of the past five. He has seen it all. He has schemed it all.\n\nJackson is a massive talent. He\u2019s 11-3 as a starter and pilots a legit Super Bowl contender. He\u2019s at home.\n\nHe may be the one to break the Belichick-vs.-young-QBs streak and stand up for the hyped draft class of 2018.\n\nThen again \u2026 Jackson is often compared to a young Michael Vick. Well, in 2001, Belichick squared off against a young Vick, then just 21. Vick split snaps that day with Chris Chandler to finish only 2-of-9 for 56 yards passing, three sacks, 50 yards rushing and no scores by ground or by air.\n\nNew England won, 24-10.\n\nHow about a young Randall Cunningham? Well, Belichick, as the Giants defensive coordinator, faced the then Philadelphia star four times during his first two seasons (1985-86). Cunningham completed 40.8 percent of his passes for an average of 57.8 yards a game with one TD and two interceptions. He was sacked 13 times and had an average of 36 yards rushing per game.\n\nThe Giants won all four games.\n\nWho knows, it might be the same Pats gameplan on Sunday.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Bill Belichick is 6-0 against the Class of 2018 QBs.
