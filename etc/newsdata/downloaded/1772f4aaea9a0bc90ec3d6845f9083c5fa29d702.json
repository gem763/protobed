On top of that, Musk peppered investors with positive updates: Tesla\u2019s new factory in China is already starting production, the Model Y crossover will launch months earlier than expected next year and the long languishing energy business is showing signs of life.\n\nIt all added up to a report that broke the mold for Musk, 48, who\u2019s notorious for setting stretch goals that take longer to pull off than he plans. Tesla still faces challenges: quarterly revenue fell for the first time since 2012, and the company has posted the occasional profit in the past that it\u2019s been unable to sustain. But after reporting reined-in expenses that padded gross profit margins, the shares climbed in late trading to levels last seen in February.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the margins and the profitability, that\u2019s the major feather in the cap for the bulls,\u201d Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said on Bloomberg Television. \u201cIf they can maintain this, this could be a potential game changer for them going forward.\u201d\n\nTesla shares climbed as much as 21% to $308.50 in late trading. The stock was down 23% this year through Wednesday\u2019s close. The company\u2019s 5.3% bonds rose 2 cents on the dollar to 93.75 cents, according to Trace, the highest level since March 2018.\n\nTrial output of the Model 3 is underway at the factory Tesla began building early this year on the outskirts of Shanghai. Producing the sedan locally enables Musk to charge less for the car by avoiding import duties. The factory \u201copens up a whole new market\u201d for the company, said Gene Munster, a managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures.\n\nProduction and deliveries of the Model Y, which shares underpinnings with the Model 3, will start in the summer of next year, rather than the fall. Musk -- never one to back down from outlandish predictions -- said the crossover could outsell the Model S, X and 3 combined.\n\nElon Musk Set Up China Plant in Record Time\u2014Now the Hard Part\n\nA new Tesla pickup, which Musk has teased on Twitter and said could be unveiled next month, is the company\u2019s \u201cbest product ever,\u201d he told analysts on the earnings call.\n\n\u2018Niche Products\u2019\n\nThe CEO was as candid as he\u2019s ever been about the extent to which Tesla is no longer focused on the high-priced Model S and X, both of which can sell for six figures, calling them \u201creally niche products.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be totally frank, we\u2019re continuing to make them more for sentimental reasons than anything else,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re only of minor importance to the future.\u201d\n\nFor all of Musk\u2019s nonchalance, the pivot toward lower-priced cars at the expense of pricier models has been financially taxing. Revenue fell to $6.3 billion in the third quarter, missing analysts\u2019 estimates and dropping from $6.8 billion a year ago.\n\nEarnings improved in part thanks to the company recognizing about $30 million of deferred revenue based on Musk making a controversial addition to its suite of drive-assistance features known as Autopilot. Smart Summon, which allows Tesla owners to tap their smartphone and remotely call for their car to pick them up, was rolled out to customers through an over-the-air update days before the end of the quarter.\n\n\u201cThe business model is slowly shifting to high-margin software,\u201d Loup Ventures\u2019 Munster said.\n\nMusk has been charging customers for performance features that Tesla vehicles aren\u2019t actually capable of yet. At the end of June, the company said it expected to recognize $567 million of deferred revenue in the following 12 months. It\u2019s now anticipating the release of almost $500 million tied to the rollout of Autopilot and \u201cFull Self Driving\u201d features, according to the statement, which doesn\u2019t give a time frame.\n\nTesla\u2019s gross margin in the third quarter was 22.8%, down from a year ago but a 3.9 percentage point improvement from the prior three months.\n\n\u201cThe balance sheet is good, demand\u2019s good and gross margins beat expectations across the board,\u201d said Ben Kallo, an analyst at Robert W. Baird who recommends buying Tesla shares. In the coming days, he predicted, \u201cyou\u2019ll also see a lot of short covering.\u201d", "description": "Tesla Packs Profit Report With Positivity as Musk Breaks Mold", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic31f453cf29803204fc202297a593efe9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
