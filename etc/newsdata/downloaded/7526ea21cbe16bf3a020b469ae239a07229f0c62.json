Now, one artist has imagined what these services would look like if they were actually made for that bygone era, whether it\u2019s an Instagram-branded Polaroid camera, a Spotify cassette player, or a VHS tape player featuring YouTube\u2019s color scheme.\n\nOkay, to be fair, the designs from concept artist Sheng Lam, noted by Kotaku earlier this week, don\u2019t technically name each of the services they\u2019re based on, but it would be hard not to mistake SoundKloud for SoundCloud or YooTube for YouTube.\n\nTwitter gets reimagined as a Telegraph key used to send messages in Morse code\n\nLam\u2019s anime-styled illustrations manage to do a convincing job at imagining what the likes of Netflix and Twitter would have looked like in a pre-internet age. Netflix (ahem, sorry, Netflex) is a chunky CRT TV of course, while Twitter (nay, Tweeter) is a Telegraph key, used for sending Morse code messages.\n\nIf I had to nitpick, I\u2019d say that SoundCloud\u2019s emphasis on DIY music makes the service a better fit for a cassette player than Spotify does, but the art is good-looking enough that I think he gets away with it.\n\nYou can check out the high-res images over on Sheng Lam\u2019s ArtStation page, and there are also prints available on Inprnt.", "description": "One artist has imagined what the internet\u2019s biggest services would look like if they were made for a bygone analogue era, whether it\u2019s an Instagram-branded Polaroid camera, or a Spotify cassette player.", "authors": ["Jon Porter", "Jul"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YBxPpzZ2y9pmQo_s-L0m1owGh0M=/0x191:1920x1196/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18303373/sheng_lam_2_potify.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-14"}
