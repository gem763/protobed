The Iranian ship was released in August.\n\nErik Hanell, the chief executive of the ship's owner, Sweden's Stena Bulk said: \u201cThe Stena Impero has now left Iranian waters and is on route to Dubai.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Captain has reported that all crew members are safe and in high spirits following release.\u201d\n\n\u201cUpon arrival, the crew will receive medical checks and de-briefing by the Company, following which arrangements have been made for them to return directly to their families in their respective countries.\u201d\n\n\u201cStena Bulk and Northern Marine Management would like to take this opportunity to praise the crew for their professionalism in the handling of this difficult and stressful situation. Also, to their families who maintained a caring and supportive role throughout. The importance of their support cannot be over stated.\u201d\n\nThe vessel was heading for Dubai's Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates, about 250 km (155 miles) away, Refinitiv tracking data showed. At normal tanker speed, it would reach that destination within half a day.\n\nIran's seizure of the ship on July 19 ratcheted up tensions in the region after attacks in May and June on other merchant vessels in Gulf waters, which Washington blamed on Tehran. Iran has denied responsibility.\n\nThe Ports and Maritime Organization of Iran in Hormozgan Province said in a statement that the ship had begun moving from Bandar Abbas at 9 a.m. Iran time (0530 GMT) on Friday and said it was heading towards international waters.\n\nIt said the judicial file on the vessel was still open and the process of looking into \"violations\" by the ship continued.\n\nIran's Foreign Ministry had said on Wednesday that the detention order had been lifted but the investigation continued.\n\nStena Bulk said on Wednesday it was not in negotiations with Iran and said was not aware of any formal charges against the crew or the company.\n\nIran had earlier released seven of the ship's 23 crew members.\n\nRelations between the United States and Iran have become more strained since Washington withdrew last year from a global pact to rein in Tehran's nuclear programme and imposed sanctions on the country aimed at shutting down Iranian oil exports.\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said: \u201cThe Stena Impero was unlawfully seized by Iran. It is part of a pattern of attempts to disrupt freedom of navigation. We are working with our international partners to protect shipping and uphold the international rule of law.\u201d", "description": "The British-flagged\u00a0tanker that was seized by Iranian forces in July has left Iranian waters, its owners said.
