(I took a trading short rental three days ago.)\n\nHere are some of my reasons why I aggressively shorted CAT this week:\n\nThe rate of growth in all of the company's end markets are peaking.\n\nThe Construction division will suffer from a peak in activity (and pricing), the end of the replacement cycle and developing excess inventory issues (which will likely lead to destocking in 2020). With degradation in oil and gas capital spending plans, Energy and Transportation will also be weak next year.\n\nThe Construction, Energy and Transportation divisions will likely be turning negative next year while the Resources division outlook is deteriorating (as mining plans moderate and recent commodity price declines take hold).\n\nIn 2020 the earnings drag from the construction division will materially widen from this year (to -$0.90/share from \"only\" -$0.25/share). The energy and transportation division's drag will be more or less the same in 2019 and 2020, while the resources division's positive contribution will halve (to +$0.25/share from +$0.60/share).\n\nWith year over year drops in contributions to EPS from construction, energy and transportation offset by a positive contribution from Resources, share buybacks will be responsible for all of the year over year EPS (+3%) gain in 2019. That benefit (of $0.55/share in 2019) will moderate a bit next year.\n\nAs opposed to the consensus (and despite continued share buybacks), I expect EPS in 2020 (under $11/share) to be lower than 2019 ($11.70/share).\n\nCAT earned $11.22/share last year. The stagnation of earnings from 2018 through 2020 means that the company (unimpressively) will have made no EPS progress since 2018 - despite an aggressive share buyback program.\n\nBased on my forecast for subpar global economic growth and continued trade tensions with China I expect weakening results to continue in 2021.\n\nThis morning Morgan Stanley downgraded Caterpillar:\n\n\"The end market backdrop for CAT'S construction end market has deteriorated rapidly in recent months as evidenced by the decline in our CONI index. Our recent AlphaWise US Construction Dealer survey also raised fresh concerns about a dealer inventory de-stock in '20 as well as pricing concerns. Since we last adjusted numbers in our 3Q preview, our Oil Services team (led by Connor Lynagh) also took down its O&G capex estimates for 2020 and now expects NA upstream capex to be down -6%/-7%. Cumulatively, we have reduced our FY20/FY21 estimates by ~5-6% this month.\"", "description": "...and here are some of my reasons why I had aggressively shorted Caterpillar....CAT", "authors": ["Doug Kass", "Kass", "Here'S Why Cat Is Still A Dog", "...And Here Are Some Of My Reasons Why I Had Aggressively Shorted Caterpillar.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Bruce Kamich", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Bret Jensen", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/d1df9c50-2302-11e9-82b4-3db4f44c0351.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
