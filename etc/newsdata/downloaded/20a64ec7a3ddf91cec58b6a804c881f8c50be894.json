Local transport laws allow rental cars with a capacity of 11-15 seats to be legally leased with a driver.Tada\u2019s app links customers to vans driven by one of the service\u2019s pool of drivers.Tada has rapidly expanded its presence in the Seoul metropolitan area, boasting over 1.2 million users and 1,400 registered vehicles as of the end of September.Nine out of 10 Tada users called the service again after their initial journey.The expanded service comes as there is still wrangling with the local taxi industry over the legality of the service. Taxi drivers claim that the Tada service is abusing a legal loophole and killing jobs.In July, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport came up with a plan to help settle the conflict between taxis and new platform companies.In the ministry\u2019s proposal, car-hailing services like the rental van-hailing service Tada should chip in a certain portion of their earnings to a state-managed fund to be established for the purchase of taxi driver licenses at times of oversupply.VCNC and the taxi industry refused to accept the government\u2019s proposals.But the ministry said it will push forward with them regardless.In Korea, taxi drivers have long been criticized for reckless driving, rudeness and refusing passengers because of their destinations. So there has been rising demand for better services.Although Tada, also the Korean word for \u201cride,\u201d set its prices higher than those of conventional taxis when it started last year, its fares are currently not very different from those of normal taxis in Seoul, which rose 19 percent to a starting rate of 3,800 won ($3.30) in February.Yonhap", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
