In July, following a visit to a detention center in which guards told women to \u201cdrink out of the toilet,\u201d Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called the conditions a form of \u201cpsychological warfare.\u201d King called his sip from the toilet \u201cactually pretty good.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, in front of a town-hall crowd of around 80 in Eagle Grove, Iowa, the embattled congressman said that he \u201cactually went into that cell where it was reported that they were advised they had to drink out of the toilet.\u201d The trip, and the anecdote, appeared to be designed to prove Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s claims wrong. In front of his constituents \u2014 as he hemorrhages money for reelection \u2014 King explained the toilet-fountain and described his 2010 Vice pitch:\n\n\u201cIn the back where the lid would be on our toilet, that\u2019s also sealed. And there\u2019s a water fountain there, you push the button, the water comes out and you take a drink, it\u2019s how it is. It\u2019s not drinking out of the toilet, it\u2019s drinking out of the water fountain that\u2019s integral with the back of the toilet.\u201d\n\nAs NBC News notes, \u201cToilets that also serve as a water fountain have been used in Border Patrol facilities for years, as well as in jails around the U.S.\u201d Though they had previously been used by single men crossing the border, in recent months families with children are now using the hybrid. Below is a video of the congressman drinking from the toilet\u2019s upper deck:\n\nHello Maura: Thank you for covering my town hall, attended by 103 people, in Eagle Grove today. I hope you will include this video in NBC\u2019s coverage. No way was @AOC objectively honest in her #FakeNews spin about the border. Click bait for Snowflakes! https://t.co/2mWRoxv1uW pic.twitter.com/B0kD3N5Vmj \u2014 Steve King (@SteveKingIA) September 4, 2019\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be surprising that King\u2019s point is being argued in bad faith anyway. When Ocasio-Cortez described migrants being told to drink from the toilets, she claims that the sink portion of the devices \u201cwas not functioning \u2026 so the women were told they could drink out of the bowl.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, as King attempts to pull attention away from his racist-rhetoric problem and his abandonment by former donors, migrant children are reportedly sleeping in cold cells and not being given adequate food. According to Representative Elijiah Cummings, one child was recently told by a guard to eat off the floor after spilling soup. Detained children separated from their parents are also feeling profound mental health effects: \u201cYou get a lot of \u2018my chest hurts,\u2019 even though everything is fine,\u201d a clinician recently told government watchdog investigators.", "description": "Iowa Congressman and accused white nationalist Steve King drank from a toilet-fountain hybrid at a migrant detention facility on the border to dispel claims from Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that detainees are treated inhumanely.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/04/steve_king.w1200.h630.jpg"}
