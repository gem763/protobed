With Trump\u2019s blessing, Giuliani operated in 2018 and 2019 a shadow foreign policy in which he met with Ukrainian officials and urged them to investigate Joe Biden for corruption \u2014 all with the aim of helping Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection bid.\n\nThe intelligence community whistleblower\u2019s complaint also describes the months-long campaign to push out Yovanovitch. \u201cSeveral US officials told me that, in fact, her tour was curtailed because of pressure stemming from\u201d baseless allegations made by a desperate Ukrainian official who was trying to curry favor with the Trump administration, the whistleblower wrote. \u201cMr. Giuliani subsequently stated in an interview with a Ukrainian journalist published on 14 May that Ambassador Yovanovitch was \u2018removed\u2026because she was part of the efforts against the President.'\u201d\n\nGiuliani and his cronies viewed Yovanovitch as an obstacle to their efforts because, as Yovanovitch put it in her comments to Congress, she viewed Giuliani\u2019s theories about Biden and corruption to be baseless. Indeed, there is no evidence to back up the theory peddled by Trump, Giuliani, and others that Biden, when he was vice president, he used his influence to get Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor fired to benefit his son Hunter, who had taken a position with a scandal-plagued energy company. But in the eyes of Trump, Yovanovitch was disloyal and needed to be removed.\n\n\u201cFinally, after being asked by the Department in early March to extend my tour until 2020, I was then abruptly told in late April to come back to Washington from Ukraine \u2018on the next plane,'\u201d she said.\n\nYovanovitch told investigators that the deputy secretary at the State Department told her that she had \u201cdone nothing wrong\u201d but that there was a \u201cconcerted campaign\u201d against her. In May Trump finally removed her from her post. Yovanovitch still works at the State Department in a different role, and by defying the department\u2019s demand that she not sit for a deposition, she could face punishment for her speaking out.\n\nIn her comments, Yovanovitch, who has worked at the State Department for three decades, lamented the dangerous direction that the department has taken under Trump and his handpicked secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. \u201cToday we see the State Department attacked and hollowed out from within,\u201d she said. If members of Congress didn\u2019t step up to defend the department from the Trump administration\u2019s meddling, \u201cI fear that not doing so will harm our nation\u2019s interest, perhaps irreparably.\u201d\n\nBest of Rolling Stone\n\nSee where your favorite artists and songs rank on the Rolling Stone Charts.\n\n\n\nSign up for Rolling Stone\u2019s Newsletter.
