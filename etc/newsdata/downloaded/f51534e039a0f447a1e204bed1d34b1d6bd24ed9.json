The bullpen kept New York in check until LeMahieu tied it in the ninth with a two-run homer to right field.\n\nYankees starting pitcher Chad Green lasted just one inning after he surrendered the home run to Gurriel. Green allowed two hits and three runs and walked one.\n\nFirst baseman LeMahieu won a 10-pitch confrontation, which included fouling off four two-strike pitches.\n\nWhen Astros closer Roberto Osuna left a pitch over the middle of the plate, LeMahieu drilled it 351 feet the opposite way just over the right field fence for a game-tying home run that silenced the crowd.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Jose Altuve hit a two-run walk off homer to lift the Houston Astros to a 6-4 win Saturday over the New York Yankees and punch their ticket to the World Series for the second time in three years.
