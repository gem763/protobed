That attention to slow and thoughtful design and detail has definitely impacted our creative process.\u201d\n\nBird & Knoll\u2019s collections of effortlessly elegant scarves, dresses, tunics and jumpsuits in silk, linen and cotton have attracted a slew of celebrity fans, including actors Emily Blunt and Elizabeth Banks and, perhaps most notably, India Hicks.\n\nThe former model and cousin and goddaughter of Prince Charles is also a passionate traveller, and stocks Bird & Knoll at her upscale Bahamas boutique The Sugar Mill, whose laid-back island style has been a big inspiration for Knoll\u2019s own resort collections.\n\nBird & Knoll\u2019s Venice scarf, $298, is inspired by the lamp posts of Piazza San Marco.\n\n\u201cI love to travel anywhere that offers excitement and full-on adventure,\u201d says Hicks. \u201cI have five wildly spirited kids who are always ready for something a bit mad. We\u2019ve bungee jumped off the Victoria Falls Bridge in Zimbabwe, zip lined in Costa Rica and kitesurfed in the Carolinas.\u201d\n\nHicks says she was drawn to Bird & Knoll\u2019s uniqueness and authenticity, and has their white cotton Freida shirt dress on high rotation. \u201cIt\u2019s very flattering, it\u2019s just the right weight, and it doesn\u2019t make me look like I\u2019m wearing my dressing gown.\u201d\n\nKnoll\u2019s passion for European travel was cemented when she lived in London for six years a decade ago, and she cites Italy as a favourite destination. \u201cThis year my husband and I travelled to Puglia and Sicily with our two teenage daughters, with a stop in Rome on the way,\" she says. \"We absolutely fell in love with the gorgeous Puglian towns of Lecce, Ostuni, Otranto and Polignano a Mare \u2013 so rustic and typically Italian.\u201d\n\nOtranto in Puglia boasts spectacular Mediterranean beaches. iStock\n\nRome, however, continues to hold a special place in Knoll\u2019s heart. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain charming grittiness to it that gets me every time.\u201d\n\nEach Roman adventure involves a pilgrimage to Taverna Trilussa in the Trastevere \u2013 \u201ca must for their amazing pastas, served in the pan they\u2019re cooked in\u201d \u2013 and the designer gets her \u201cupmarket fix\u201d at La Rinascente, which she describes as \u201cthe most beautiful department store in Rome\u201d.\n\nThe 68-page bumper Grand Journeys issue of Sophisticated Traveller is out on Friday, October 18 inside The Australian Financial Review.
