Limauro set out to trace Hubbard\u2019s descendants and return the card to them.\n\n\u201cUsing a 1940 census online, she found the names of his wife and children,\u201d explained the Toledo Lucas County Public Library, in a blog post. \u201cThe Library\u2019s Local History and Genealogy Department staff provided her with obituaries for some of Hubbard\u2019s children that led to additional names.\u201d\n\nTHIS BULLET-SCARRED BIBLE \u2018SAVED THE LIFE\u2019 OF A WORLD WAR I SOLDIER\n\nLimauro then sent a message to Hubbard\u2019s grandson and some other relatives. \u201cAfter a couple weeks, Limauro called Hubbard\u2019s grandson, Ed McPeek of Las Vegas, and was elated to hear back,\u201d the library explained in the blog post. McPeek\u2019s granddaughter had seen the message and linked her grandfather and Limauro.\n\nThe card, which had spent decades tucked inside the family Bible, has now been returned to Ed McPeek.\n\n\u201cI am so happy to say that I will be able to pass this family memento on to Ed and his family,\u201d Limauro said, according to the blog post. \u201cI hope some day to be able to meet Ed and [his wife] Debbie in person and hear more about their family and their history in our area.\u201d\n\nWORLD WAR I POSTERS OFFER UNIQUE GLIMPSE INTO SOLDIERS' STORIES 100 YEARS AFTER THE ARMISTICE\n\nAccording to the card, Hubbard registered for the draft on Sept. 12, 1918, just a couple of months before the end of hostilities on Nov. 11, 1918.\n\n\u201cEd McPeek remembers the distinctive green Bible at the Toledo home of his grandparents, Clement and Mayme Hubbard, until his grandfather\u2019s death in 1964,\u201d the library said in its blog post. \u201cIt then passed to his parents, Helen and Kenneth McPeek, in Ottawa Lake, Michigan. After Ed McPeek\u2019s father died, the Bible was donated to St. Michael\u2019s Lutheran Church.\u201d\n\nThe Bible ended up in the Friends of the Library book sale at the Sylvania branch of the Toledo Lucas County Public Library, where it was bought by Limauro.\n\nHISTORIAN DISCOVERS SECRET NOTES HIDDEN IN 500-YEAR-OLD BIBLE\n\nOther Bibles have been garnering attention in recent years. A Bible marked with bullet holes from a German machine gun helped save the life of a British World War I soldier, his daughter explained last year.\n\nIn 2016, the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia purchased an extremely rare Bible from the Battle of Bunker Hill. The King James Bible, which is on display in the museum, is inscribed by American soldier Francis Merrifield, who thanks God for sparing his life in the bloody 1775 battle.\n\nAlso in 2016, a historian in the U.K. discovered secret notes hidden in the text of England\u2019s first printed bible. Analysis of the Latin Bible, which was published in 1535 by Henry VIII\u2019s printer, has revealed fascinating English annotations made during the 16th-century Reformation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers", "description": "When\u00a0Christy Limauro\u00a0purchased an old family Bible at a library book sale in Toledo, Ohio, she was intrigued to find a\u00a0small brown card tucked inside.", "authors": ["James Rogers"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/WWIRegistrationCard.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
