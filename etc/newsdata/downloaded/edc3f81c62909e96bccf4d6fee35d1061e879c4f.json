As the sun shines on the icy layers at Mars's north pole, it gets heated up. The layered piles then become destabilised and blocks can fall off.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

These so-called red giants then begin to lose their outer layers of material into space. More than half of such a star's mass can be shed in this manner, forming a shell of surrounding gas. At the same time, the star's core shrinks and grows hotter, emitting ultraviolet light that causes the expelled gases to glow. This type of object is called, somewhat confusingly, a planetary nebula, though it has nothing to do with planets. The name derives from the rounded, planet-like appearance of these objects in early telescopes\" - European Space Agency Nasa 2/10 Two galaxies are seen interacting with one another. This pair of galaxies is known as UGC2369 and they are being drawn together by mutual gravitational attraction.

Those different colours and textures that can be seen in the photo depend on how much dust has mixed with the ice, wrote planetary scientist Candy Hansen, who works on the seasonal behaviours of other planets.\n\nThough Nasa published the picture this week, it was actually taken back in May.", "description": "Nasa has revealed stunning pictures of the aftermath of a huge avalance on Mars.
