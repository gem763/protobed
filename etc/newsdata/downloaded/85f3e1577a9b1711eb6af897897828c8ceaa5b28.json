We'll be there, and look forward to meeting readers!\n\nHere's a roundup of Business Insider's WeWork coverage.\n\nThe commercial real estate tech industry is gathering in Brooklyn for a two-day conference kicking off on Wednesday.\n\nWe talked to people attending or speaking at CREtech New York to get a sense of what to expect. We were especially curious what the mood would be like, given the conference is being held at a massive new WeWork-anchored development, and until a few weeks ago featured a now-departed WeWork exec among its speakers.\n\nMost said they were excited to meet up with like minds, and that prospects for companies blending tech and real estate remain bright. Several noted that they didn't consider WeWork a proptech company to begin with, and said there are plenty of opportunities.\n\nTroubles have continued in recent days for WeWork. The company was already planning to slash thousands of jobs and jettison or shutter businesses after a failed IPO, and according to media reports on Friday is now looking to lock down a $5 billion lifeline from lenders in the coming days to stave off a cash crunch.\n\nRead more: VC Camber Creek, which has steered clear of co-working, explains how it invests in the midst of a proptech gold rush\n\nWe visited Dock 72, the new development in the Brooklyn Navy Yard that is hosting conference, in August. The building is a partnership between Boston Properties, Rudin Management, and WeWork, which is also slated to be the anchor tenant.\n\nDock 72, which was still unfinished when Business Insider visited, opened to WeWork on October 1st, with an official launch date this Tuesday.\n\nGranit Gjonbalaj, WeWork's chief real estate development officer, was originally slated to speak. But he left the co-working company last month soon after CEO Adam Neumann resigned, and will no longer be talking. Boston Properties CEO Owen Thomas is taking his spot on the agenda.\n\nOther speakers include Mihir Shah and Yishai Lerner, co-CEOs of recently-launched JLL Technologies; Steve Weikal, head of industry relations at the MIT Center for Real Estate; Lisa Picard, president and CEO of EQ Office; Brad Greiwe and Brendan Wallace, co-founders of proptech-focused VC Fifth Wall Ventures; Minta Kay, partner and chair of global real estate industry group of Goodwin; and more.\n\nRead more: WeWork is preparing to move into this massive, flashy Brooklyn building as its IPO plans crumble. We took a look inside.\n\nHere's what people will be talking about. We look forward to meeting our readers at the event!\n\nSteve Weikal, head of industry relations at the MIT Center for Real Estate\n\nMIT Center for Real Estate offers a master of science in real estate development and a professional certificate for real estate professionals. It also conducts research on trends in the industry.\n\nWhat are you most excited for at the event?\n\nEach year at CREtech we get a reality check on the rapidly changing real estate tech landscape \u2013 what's working and what's not, latest trends, etc.\n\nWhat are your expectations for the conference?\n\n\n\nRight now we're at a point in the innovation cycle where there's maturation \u2013 of technologies and firms. We're seeing some mergers, acquisitions, rollups and blowups.\n\nHas the recent slew of WeWork news changed your expectations for the event?\n\nWeWork is a bit of a distraction, although a significant one. The trend toward real estate fracking \u2013 where the asset and/or use gets broken up and reconfigured into higher value combinations \u2013 will continue to disrupt and reinvent the industry. We think there will be more co-everything in real estate, including work.\n\nLisa Picard, president and CEO of EQ Office\n\nEQ Office is Blackstone's U.S. office portfolio company. It changed its name from Equity Office in 2018 in order to embrace the growing popularity of flex office space, according to media reports at the time.\n\nWhat are you most excited for at the event?\n\nTo see the level of engagement around the new power tools of real estate. When working in legacy businesses, change is the hardest thing to affect, and that's why disruption targets legacy industries.\n\nWhat are your expectations for the conference?\n\n\n\nMy expectations are great attendance.\n\nHas the recent slew of WeWork news changed your expectations for the event?\n\nThere are no changed expectations for the conference. What the company has done to drive productization into office real estate is remarkable. It has totally changed our industry \u2026 and we can't go back.\n\nBrian Murphy, CEO of Breather\n\nBreather is an on-demand office and meeting room company that rents space for as little as one hour at a time.\n\nWhat are you most excited for at the event?\n\nEvery CREtech is a different conference. This year, the intersection of technology and real estate - proptech, if you will - is a big theme, and I'm looking forward to hearing varied industry perspectives on where the industry is today and where it could be in a few years.\n\nWhat are your expectations for the conference?\n\n\n\nI expect much off-panel conversation about WeWork's broader effects on the industry. We're already seeing the impact on leasing activity, so it will be interesting to get more color.\n\nHas the recent slew of WeWork news changed your expectations for the event?\n\nWell, the conversations probably would have been a bit different should WeWork have recently pulled off a successful IPO. That said, the WeWork news seems to be pushing the growing demand for flexible workspace solutions to companies like Breather, so we're happy to service that demand.\n\nGabrielle McMillan, CEO of Equiem\n\nEquiem is a tenant-experience platform that connects tenants in office buildings to amenities, local commerce, and landlords.\n\nWhat are you most excited for at the event?\n\nWe are always excited for the opportunity CRETech New York affords to meet other providers, showcase our products, and gauge the general tone around the proptech sector - particularly in terms of investment, adoption, and innovation.\n\nWhat are your expectations for the conference?\n\n\n\nWe certainly expect WeWork to be mentioned once or twice! That aside, with a record capital raise and new product launches, it's been a really exciting year for ourselves thus far, as well as for the tenant experience technology space more widely.\n\nHas the recent slew of WeWork news changed your expectations for the event?\n\nNo, and I don't think it should. We have never really considered WeWork a technology company so I don't see it as having any bearing on the health of the proptech sector.\n\nThat said, I think WeWork's recent news will provide a springboard for delegates to discuss important wider topics like the ongoing evolution of the office sector, changing tenant expectations and how technology can help landlords meet those expectations.\n\nAndrew Kitchell, CEO and founder of Lyric\n\nLyric operates short-term rentals in apartments, blurring the line between a hotel and a traditional apartment. Airbnb is a large investor.\n\nWhat are you most excited for at the event?\n\nAnytime you get some of the most notable companies in the commercial real estate landscape in a forum that is focused on emerging technologies, and discussing what's possible into the future, it creates an environment moves the industry forward.\n\nWhat are your expectations for the conference?\n\n\n\nI think we will see a lot of conversation around our generation's focus on experiences over possessions, and renting over buying.\n\nHas the recent slew of WeWork news changed your expectations for the event?\n\nWhile I see a lot of lessons in WeWork, I don't see headlines around WeWork having a long-term, sustained impact on deterring the overall excitement around real estate tech.\n\nIf anything, WeWork's rapid rise helped drive a huge amount of interest, from both venture capitalists and traditional real estate teams, to invest in technology tied to real estate.\n\nDror Poleg, author of \"Rethinking Real Estate\" and co-chair of the Urban Land Institute's Technology and Innovation Council\n\nThe Urban Land Institute is a research and education organization that focuses on real estate development and urban policy. The board is headed by Owen Thomas, CEO of Boston Properties.\n\nWhat are you most excited for at the event?\n\nThere are two presentations that I really want to see. One is from Lisa Picard, President and CEO of Blackstone's EQ Office. The other is from Karen Hollinger, who heads strategic initiatives at AvalonBay. Both Lisa and Karen have been studying the impact on technology on their respective businesses very thoroughly and have loads of hands-on operational experience in office, multifamily, and hospitality.\n\nWhat are your expectations for the conference?\n\n\n\nThe lineup of speakers is excellent, the venue \u2014 finally in Brooklyn! \u2014 is great, and interest in real estate tech has never been higher.\n\nHas the recent slew of WeWork news changed your expectations for the event?\n\nThey have not changed my expectations, but I am sure it will be one of the more popular topics \u2014 what's next for WeWork, how does the botched IPO impact funding and exits in the space, and everyone's hot takes on what the company should do next.\n\nColleen Werner, founder and CEO of LulaFit\n\nLulaFit operates health and wellness amenities for both commercial and residential real estate owners.\n\nWhat are you most excited for at the event?\n\nNetworking with other entrepreneurs is a highlight for me. It's always exciting to see what new proptech is emerging, how existing companies have expanded their products and the trends panels are discussing.\n\nWhat are your expectations for the conference?\n\n\n\nMy schedule is fully booked with networking, attending panels and doing some speaking myself! My team will be there at our booth talking to other companies and clients. It's going to be a great week in Brooklyn!\n\nHas the recent slew of WeWork news changed your expectations for the event?\n\nNo, if anything, I think it's becoming more apparent that this industry has surpassed WeWork. They were an initial innovator and I'm sure will continue to drive forward, but most importantly, the company has paved the way for a lot of other entrepreneurial leadership and companies who are continuing to push CRE forward.\n\nAs the next wave of innovators rise, I think it's important to recognize the impact WeWork has had and the responsibility that comes with that impact so that we can all continue to do our best to be a positive force on the industry.", "description": "Startups and experts are looking to gauge proptech's state of play.
