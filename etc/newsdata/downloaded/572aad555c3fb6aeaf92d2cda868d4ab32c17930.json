For example, 41% of consumers expect sales associates to know about their previous purchases, but just 19% have experienced this, according to a report from Segment.\n\nIn The In-Store Personalization Report, Business Insider Intelligence analyzes how physical retail's personalization is being outperformed by e-commerce's, and examines the value personalization holds for brick-and-mortar in particular. We also look at what techniques and technologies are available to help retailers identify and track consumers in-store, and how they can be used to bolster their personalization capabilities. Finally, we examine the different channels through which retailers can reach consumers with their personalized offerings in-store.\n\nThe companies mentioned in this report are: Amazon, Alibaba, JD.com, Intel, Mastercard, Target, Velocity Worldwide, RetailMeNot, b8ta, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Sitecore, Oak Labs, Calabrio, and Alegion.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the report:\n\nConsumers say that a personalized shopping experience can inspire loyalty and increases in spending.\n\nBut brick-and-mortar retailers aren't meeting consumers' in-store personalization expectations.\n\nThe nature of online shopping gives e-commerce the upper hand when it comes to personalization.\n\nPhysical retailers can close the gap in personalization by identifying consumers when they enter, tracking them throughout their journey, and then using that information to inform individualized offerings.\n\nTo make the most of personalized offerings, retailers must consider how content is being presented to consumers in-store, and what the strengths of each channel are.\n\nIf physical retailers fail to improve their in-store personalization, they risk losing sales and market share to e-commerce companies, both online and in-store.\n\nIn full, the report:\n\nIdentifies the values of personalization to physical retailers.\n\nDetails the reasons e-tailers currently offer better personalization than brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nOutlines the technologies and processes that can bolster in-store personalization.\n\nDiscusses how retailers can best present personalized offerings in-store.\n\nInterested in getting the full report?
