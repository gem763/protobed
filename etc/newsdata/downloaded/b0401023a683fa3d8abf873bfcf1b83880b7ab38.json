In the last major debate, Biden advised African-American parents to make sure they had their \u201crecord player on at night\u201d in order to build their child\u2019s vocabulary, an answer that was considered both racist and hopelessly anachronistic. That set up last night\u2019s apparent stumble \u2014 or maybe, maybe an attempt at humor that ended in a faceplant. YMMV:\n\nClipping coupons? We\u201dll get back to that, but it wasn\u2019t Biden\u2019s only problem in this answer \u2014 although you\u2019d never know it by reading the New York Times transcript of the exchange. I included in bold what they left out:\n\nBIDEN: No, look. Demonizing wealth \u2014 what I talked about is how you get things done. And the way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now. The idea \u2014 we have to start rewarding work, not just wealth. I would eliminate the capital gains tax \u2014 I would, I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate of 39.5 percent. I would double it. Because guess what? Why in God\u2019s name should someone who is clipping coupons in the stock market pay a lower tax rate than someone who in fact is, like I said \u2014 a schoolteacher and a firefighter? It\u2019s ridiculous, and they pay a lower tax. Secondly, the idea that we, in fact, engage in this notion that there are \u2014 there\u2019s $1.64 trillion in tax loopholes. You can\u2019t justify at minimum $600 billion of that. We could eliminate it all. I could go into detail had I the time.\n\nDid Biden get confused about which audience he was addressing? That\u2019s not really a mere slip of the tongue. Eliminating the capital gains tax, a longtime conservative/Club for Growth position that has not gained much traction in these populist times, and might be a bit anachronistic itself for that reason. It sounds as if Biden is having trouble keeping up and keeping his arguments straight, and that\u2019s not a good look for a candidate who can\u2019t manage to spike the football even with the other team mainly on the sidelines.\n\nOne has to wonder why the NYT didn\u2019t transcribe that part of Biden\u2019s answer, too. Do they make a habit of cleaning up Biden\u2019s rhetorical missteps? If so, what other Biden-friendly edits have they made for their readers in the past?\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Biden was being sardonic with his \u201cclipping coupons in the stock market\u201d line. It could be read as a sarcastic comment on the oh-so-tough lives billionaires lead, in a \u201cwhile you\u2019re broke and clipping coupons in the supermarket, these guys are clipping coupons in the stock market\u201d class-warfare sense. It sounds like something a speech writer might have dreamed up for Biden to say as a lead-in to a typical class-warfare argument, a way to zing billionaires while charming his way into working-class hearts.\n\nIf so, Biden is terrible at delivering those punch lines. Even with that generous assumption, Biden injected only half of the zinger in the middle of a serious point that he\u2019d already screwed up, as the NYT noticed as well. Put that together with his previous musings on the importance of record players in raising children, and it\u2019s not charming at all. It looks more like a pattern that suggests Uncle Joe should seek retirement soon and maybe watch a little more Hee Haw than Maddow.\n\nFinally, just on the substance of the answer, Biden\u2019s still all wet. Even if one could wave a wand and eliminate $600 billion a year in deductions without harming the economy, that\u2019s only a drop in the bucket when it comes to what Biden and his fellow Democrats want to add in spending. Medicare for All alone would add at least three trillion dollars a year, let alone the rest of the Green New Deal projects being pushed at these debates. Pretending that Biden and Democrats can lower the tax bill for the middle class while spending all that cash is even more incoherent than \u201cclipping coupons in the stock market,\u201d and Biden\u2019s hardly the only one on stage suffering from that incoherence. Or dishonesty, but YMMV on that one, too.", "description": "Incoherence.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/biden-coupons.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
