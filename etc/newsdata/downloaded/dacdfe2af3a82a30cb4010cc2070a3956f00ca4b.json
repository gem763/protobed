Some used stereotypes to mock violence and political protest in African American communities, exhibit religious intolerance against non-Christians and denigrate people with opposing political opinions.\n\nNow, as Gray seeks the highest office in the rapidly diversifying county of 456,000 people, he finds himself doing exactly what he had hoped to avoid:\n\nExplaining why, in 2016, he tweeted the falsehood that Islam sanctions domestic abuse; why he wrote \u201ca funny tweet\u201d that same year that said African Americans would stop \u201crioting\u201d and take a knee if someone played the national anthem; and why, in 2017, he called former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson \u201ca moron\u201d for wishing Indians a happy Diwali.\n\nWith Corey Stewart leaving, Prince William\u2019s political future is up for grabs\n\nWheeler, who is vying with Gray to fill the seat being vacated by longtime board chairman and Republican firebrand Corey A. Stewart (At Large), said the attempts to hide the posts show Gray is unfit to lead Virginia\u2019s second-largest jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hide who I am,\u201d Wheeler said Monday. \u201cThe bottom line is, he deleted those tweets because he believed they\u2019re too extreme for Twitter. If they\u2019re too extreme for Twitter, they\u2019re too extreme for Prince William County, and he has no business running Prince William County.\u201d\n\nGray owned up to some of the tweets, adding that a few of the more offensive ones \u2014 including crude comments about Hillary Clinton \u2014 were posted to his Twitter account by a campaign consultant whom he has since fired.\n\n\u201cI agree that some of them were completely inappropriate,\u201d Gray said, adding that he decided to delete the tweets to avoid giving his opponents something to \u00adcriticize.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to call my campaign consultant and ask: \u2018Can you refund my $30?\u2019 \u201d he said in jest. \u201cObviously, it didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nPolitical candidates have occasionally stumbled into controversy over what they\u2019ve posted on social media, including President Trump. Last year, when Stewart was trying to unseat Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), his campaign posted a statement on Twitter calling a Muslim candidate for governor in Michigan \u201can ISIS commie.\u201d Stewart had that post deleted and blamed it on a consultant he also fired.\n\nGray admits to not having much of a social media filter before he announced his candidacy in March \u2014 and even in the months that followed.\n\nIn July, he posted a suggestion that Muslim hookah-bar owners should be forced to sell alcohol, even though doing so would be against their religion. Gray later said he regretted that tweet, which was intended as a reference to a legal battle involving a Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple based on his religious beliefs.\n\nHis campaign launched the cleanup effort about the same time he posted that tweet.\n\nGray was less apologetic about some of the other deleted tweets, including one in 2017 that said the \u201cbong and dildo holders\u201d who tried to impeach Trump would be met with \u201c300 million weapons and an estimated 2 billion rounds of ammo\u201d in the conservative uprising that would be sure to follow.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not inciting violence,\u201d Gray said Monday, explaining that the tweet was in reply to somebody else\u2019s tweeted prediction of an uprising.\n\nHe also defended a 2016 tweet about Muslim men and domestic abuse, posted in reply to a Washington Post article that included an account of domestic abuse suffered by the wife of Omar Mateen, the gunman who killed 49 people at a gay bar in Orlando in 2016.\n\n\u201cWell, what did you expect? Being Islamic you knew he had the right to beat you,\u201d Gray posted. Gray said the comment was based on his understanding of Sharia law.\n\nRafi Ahmed, president of the Dar Alnoor Islamic Community Center in Prince William, said Gray may have been referring to a common mischaracterization of a section in the Koran about domestic relations, which, Ahmed said, sanctions light forms of spousal discipline but nothing physical.\n\n\u201cStriking is not an option,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cIf Mr. Gray has that perception, I would be more than willing to sit down with him and talk on this subject in detail.\u201d\n\nDonald Scoggins, an independent also running for the chairman\u2019s seat, said Gray\u2019s tweets are inexcusable: \u201cSuch an individual does not deserve to be an elected official in Prince William County.\u201d\n\nMuneer Baig, another independent seeking the office, said he did not want to criticize Gray. \u201cI prefer to focus on what\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve all got skeletons in our closet.\u201d\n\nGray said he plans to cut down on social media. \u201cTwitter: I used to love it,\u201d he said. \u201cI barely look at it now.\u201d\n\nWith Corey Stewart leaving, Prince William\u2019s political future is up for grabs\n\nIn a pivotal year, Danica Roem uses her spotlight to boost other Va.
