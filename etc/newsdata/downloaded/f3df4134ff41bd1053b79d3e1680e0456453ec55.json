Pete Sessions subpoenaed by grand jury investigating Giuliani and associates", "language": "en", "text": "The subpoena seeks records about Sessions\u2019s dealings with Giuliani and two business associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who had been helping Giuliani investigate Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden.\n\nParnas and Fruman were charged this week with violating campaign finance law in an ongoing investigation that has ensnared the president\u2019s personal lawyer because of his relationship with the two men.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA spokesman for Sessions (R-Tex.) said in a statement: \u201cMr. Sessions is cooperating with the US Attorney from the Southern District of New York and will be providing documents to their office related to this matter over the next couple of weeks as requested.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Manhattan declined to comment. Giuliani did not immediately return a message.\n\nIn the indictment unsealed last week, prosecutors said Parnas and Fruman schemed to exceed campaign donation limits in giving money to an unnamed U.S. congressman, at the same time that they were asking the congressman to get the then-U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, removed from her job.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe indictment did not identify the congressman by name, but public campaign records indicate it was Sessions, who lost his reelection bid last year. In a statement last week, Sessions said he did not know if he was the congressman mentioned in the indictment but denied any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201c[I]f I am \u2018Congressman One\u2019, I could not have had any knowledge of the scheme described in the indictment or have involvement or coordination of it,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nThe 21-page indictment charged that in the spring of 2018, Parnas met with the congressman seeking his \u201cassistance in causing the U.S. government to remove or recall the then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine.\u201d Parnas\u2019s efforts \u201cto remove the Ambassador were conducted, at least in part, at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials,\u201d the indictment said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nParnas has previously said he and Fruman helped set up a Skype call for Giuliani in late 2018 with Viktor Shokin, who was Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general from 2015 to 2016, and an in-person meeting in New York this past January with Yuri Lutsenko, then Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor, who had urged the removal of the U.S. ambassador.\n\nIn May 2018, around the time the indictment says that Parnas and Fruman committed to raising $20,000 for the congressman, Sessions wrote a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo complaining that Yovanovitch was biased against Trump. A year later, she was recalled from her post, after Giuliani told Trump that she needed to go.\n\n\u201cAt no time did I take any official action\u201d after meeting with Parnas and Fruman, Sessions said, adding that he sent the letter because he had come to believe the ambassador was disparaging Trump in her conversations overseas.\n\nParnas and Fruman are scheduled to appear in federal court in Manhattan on Thursday.\n\nAD", "description": "The subpoena seeks records about the former congressman\u2019s dealings with the president\u2019s personal lawyer.", "authors": ["Matt Zapotosky", "National Security Reporter Covering The Justice Department", "Devlin Barrett", "Reporter Focusing On National Security", "Law Enforcement"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lOa0cA0z-ihMbaroLz_DN3MYU60=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E7V7A5HPTUI6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
