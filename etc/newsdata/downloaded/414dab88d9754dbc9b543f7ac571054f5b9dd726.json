(John Bazemore/AP Photo)\n\nIn-game updates\n\nHALF: Falcons 10, Eagles 6\n\nHalftime in Atlanta: It has been a rough first half for the Eagles in Atlanta. Quarterback Carson Wentz, who had the previous two seasons cut short for him by injuries, left the game in the final minute of the half and was examined in the medical tent on the sideline. Wentz, after being replaced temporarily by Josh McCown, returned to the game, reportedly after being cleared under the concussion protocol. The Eagles ended the half with their top three wide receivers \u2014 DeSean Jackson, Alshon Jeffery and Nelson Agholor \u2014 on the sideline. Jeffery has a calf injury. Jackson has a groin injury. Agholor absorbed a jarring hit in the end zone late in the half. Dallas Goedert, the team\u2019s No. 2 tight end, also has been out. Wentz threw two first-half interceptions, both to Desmond Trufant, and the Eagles managed only a pair of field goals by kicker Jake Elliott, including a 41-yarder as time expired in the half. One of Trufant\u2019s interceptions set up the game\u2019s lone touchdown, a 34-yard strike from Matt Ryan to Calvin Ridley for the Falcons.

Trufant made his interception while sitting on the turf, as Wentz\u2019s badly underthrown pass went directly to him. Ridley made a very nice leaping catch in the end zone for the Falcons\u2019 touchdown on a third-and-six play. (Falcons 10, Eagles 3 with 4:56 left in the 2nd quarter)\n\nFalcons have o-line woes: The Falcons used two first-round picks in this year\u2019s draft on offensive linemen. Both of them are now hurt. Offensive tackle Kaleb McGary, chosen 31st overall in the draft from Washington, was helped from the field with a knee injury. Guard Chris Lindstrom, taken 14th overall from Boston College, already is on the injured reserve list after undergoing surgery for a broken foot suffered in the season opener. The Falcons wasted a great catch on the sideline by wide receiver Julio Jones when Matt Ryan missed connections with receivers on consecutive plays on would-be touchdown passes, then kicker Matt Bryant missed a 50-yard field goal attempt. (Eagles 3, Falcons 3 with 7:42 left in the 2nd quarter)\n\nEagles get even: The Eagles reached the Atlanta 8-yard line, but they were pushed back when Carson Wentz was sacked and had to settle for a 34-yard field goal by kicker Jake Elliott. Wentz remained in the game after holding his ribs following a hit on the previous possession, and wide receiver DeSean Jackson returned to the game after making a trip to the medical tent on the Eagles\u2019 sideline.

But the Eagles did regroup in time to get into the win column for the season, and now they\u2019ll take the road to face the Falcons on Sunday night in Atlanta.\n\nThe Eagles will hope for a faster start against the Falcons than they managed against the Redskins last Sunday. The Eagles trailed that game, 17-0, before rallying with 25 second-half points on their way to a 32-27 triumph. The most encouraging development for the Eagles in the opener was that still-speedy wide receiver DeSean Jackson began his second stint with the team with an eight-catch, 154-yard, two-touchdown performance. His touchdowns covered 51 and 53 yards.\n\n[The Raiders, believe it or not, are starting to look like a competent NFL team]\n\nSo much depends on Wentz. His 2017 season was ended early by a knee injury. His 2018 season was ended early by a stress fracture in his back. Backup Nick Foles took over and led the Eagles to a Super Bowl victory to close the \u201917 season and back to the NFC playoffs last season.\n\nBut for Wentz and the Eagles, the Foles safety net is gone. The Eagles allowed Foles to leave via free agency in the offseason and sign with the Jacksonville Jaguars; he suffered a broken left clavicle in the Jaguars\u2019 season opener. The Eagles doubled down on their decision to stick with Wentz by signing him in June to a four-year, $128 million contract extension. There\u2019s no turning back now.\n\nFor the Falcons, it\u2019s their home opener after they began the season with a 28-12 loss at Minnesota. The Atlanta defense limited Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins to 98 passing yards on only 10 throws. But the Falcons surrendered 172 rushing yards to the Vikings.\n\nAtlanta certainly will look to get wide receiver Julio Jones more involved in the offense than he was in the opener. Jones was targeted 11 times by quarterback Matt Ryan against the Vikings but had only six catches for 31 yards and a touchdown. He didn\u2019t have a reception longer than 10 yards. That came after the Falcons just had made Jones the NFL\u2019s highest-paid wide receiver with a three-year, $66 million contract extension.\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nWho\u2019s Gardner Minshew?
