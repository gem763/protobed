At the height of the Me Too movement in 2017, men in powerful positions were black-balled, fired, and excommunicated at the mere mention of an allegation, even without corroborating evidence. But unlike those men, Lack\u2019s employer is standing behind him, and he\u2019s refusing to go anywhere.\n\nIn an excerpt of Farrow\u2019s book obtained by PageSix, he reports that one alleged victim said Lack preyed on young female employees and pursued sexual relationships with them.\n\nJane Wallace, an anchor on CBS\u2019 \u201cWest 57th\u201d news show when Lack was an executive producer in the late-1980s, said Lack was \u201calmost unrelenting\u201d in asking her out to dinner \u201cevery day for almost a month\u201d for the purpose of celebrating her book. Wallace said she had an affair with the then-married executive, and although it was \u201cultimately consensual \u2026 I didn\u2019t just get flirted with. I got worked over.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf your boss does that, what are you gonna say?\u201d Wallace told Farrow. \u201cYou know if you say \u2018I don\u2019t want to celebrate with you,\u2019 you\u2019re asking for trouble.\u201d\n\nAnother woman who worked at NBC as an associate producer, Jennifer Laird, allegedly had a \u201crelationship\u201d with Lack that turned \u201chostile\u201d when their relations ended, according to Farrow.\n\nFarrow\u2019s book reads, \u201cWhen Laird asked to be reassigned, Lack wouldn\u2019t allow it. He compelled her to work longer hours, and on weekends, and proposed she cancel vacations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s clearly a reason you don\u2019t get involved with your boss,\u201d Laird told Farrow.\n\nThrough representatives, Lack has denied both allegations.\n\nLast week, after more allegations swirled of what Lack and other NBC executives knew and when they knew it about both Matt Lauer and Harvey Weinstein, Lack wrote a letter to NBC staff. Lack said Farrow\u2019s description of NBC News leadership is \u201cfundamentally untrue,\u201d and he reiterated that Farrow left NBC and took his story to the New Yorker because it lacked sufficient sourcing at the time.\n\nA spokesman for Farrow challenged Lack\u2019s response, insisting, \u201crelevant sections of the book confirm not only how many women were named, but also how much proof Ronan had gathered. Importantly, it documents the lengths to which NBC executives went to thwart the reporting efforts of Ronan and his producer Rich McHugh and why they did so.\u201d\n\nShould NBC fire someone over unsubstantiated claims? Has the Me Too movement bypassed American standards for innocent until proven guilty? It\u2019s a debate the public will continue to have, probably as long as people are having sex. And yet, despite the ample supply of case studies we now have on how media organizations and entertainment empires handle these instances, NBC is doubling down on its purported ignorance.\n\nIn 2018, 12 women accused Les Moonves, chief executive of the CBS Corporation, of sexual assault and harassment. Moonves acknowledged three of the encounters, but he maintained they were consensual. At first, the CBS board decided after its own investigation that it would not take immediate action against Moonves and allowed him to remain CEO, but the board also decided it was \u201cin the process of selecting outside counsel to conduct an independent investigation.\u201d\n\nCBS ended up folding the results of Moonves\u2019 investigation into its investigation of Charlie Rose, who is also accused of sexual harassment. A month later, it announced that Moonves would be resigning and his $20 million in severance would be donated to supporting the Me Too movement.\n\nThe important point here is not the firing itself or even the timing of the firing \u2014 it\u2019s the independent investigation. On Wednesday\u2019s \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight,\u201d former NBC host Megyn Kelly reiterated her call for an independent investigation, calling out both Lack and NBC News President Noah Oppenheim.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be an outside investigation into this company. They investigated themselves. That doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Kelly said firmly. \u201cFox News had an outside investigator. CBS News had an outside investigator. NPR. The NFL. This is how it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nOne has to wonder if the accusations of Lack\u2019s behavior with women had come out at the same time as Lauer, Weinstein, and the long list of other infamous names, whether he would have been sold down the river too. Is it the passage of time that shielded him, or perhaps backlash against other uncorroborated claims, like Julie Swetnick\u2019s outlandish allegations against Justice Brett Kavanuagh, swinging the Me Too pendulum back the other way? Or is it just NBC News, furiously working to deny that any problems bigger than Matt Lauer exist in its Rockefeller tower?", "description": "As questions are raised about Andy Lack's own relationships with women, and the alleged shielding of Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer, why is NBC standing behind him?", "authors": ["Madeline Osburn"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-17-at-12.14.52-PM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
