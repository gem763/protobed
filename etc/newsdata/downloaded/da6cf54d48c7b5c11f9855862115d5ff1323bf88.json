Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire has refused to release the complaint to the House Intelligence Committee, prompting committee chairman Adam Schiff to threaten legal action to force Maguire to reveal the complaint\u2019s contents.\n\nIn her letter, Pelosi charged that the administration was blocking the release of a \u201cserious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President.\u201d However, she stopped short of calling to impeach Trump over the allegations.\n\nThe complaint centers in part around a phone call between Trump and a foreign head of state. That phone call has been identified as a July conversation between Trump and newly-elected Ukrainian prime minister Volodymir Zelentsky.\n\nTrump admitted Sunday that he urged Zelentsky to investigate whether former vice president Joe Biden used his influence to quash a corruption investigation into a Ukrainian energy company in order to protect his son, Hunter, who sat on the company\u2019s board of directors.\n\nIn 2014, Biden did threaten to withhold U.S. aid to Ukraine unless a top prosecutor involved in the corruption probe into his son was fired, but he maintains that decision was unrelated to Hunter\u2019s business interests.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a letter Sunday evening to fellow Democrats, in which she called on the Trump administration to reveal the details of a whistleblower complaint against the president by this Thursday.Pelosi warned that if the administration does not comply, it would be \"entering\u00a0a grave", "authors": ["Zachary Evans"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zVJsSn0hjd1g2Q36_7n70g--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/085bba5b777ac50a6eebaed2f17f74d7", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
