Described as an intelligence official, the second whistleblower \u201chas firsthand knowledge of some of the allegations outlined in the original complaint,\" according to his attorney Mark Zaid. The first complaint helped spark an impeachment inquiry by revealing details of a call in which Trump pressured Zelensky to open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden. Rep. Chris Stewart, when asked on \"Fox News Sunday\" about the second whistleblower, said it doesn\u2019t matter: \u201cThis person is going to come forward and say, yep the president had this phone call,\" said Stewart. \"And yep, we have this transcript. Why should I care at all?\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 25, 2019.

Police spokesman Thomas Tomasic said witnesses indicated that the suspects left the private club Tequila KC after an altercation, but came back later and started shooting. When police arrived, officers found the bodies of four Latino men ranging in age from 20s to 50s, though investigators do not believe the shootings were racially motivated. \"We believe this was an isolated incident,\" Tomasic said. \"We do not believe these suspects are going to go out and do this again.\"\n\nDavid Thevo, who lives near Tequila KC Bar, reacts outside the bar following a shooting on Oct. 6, 2019, in Kansas City, Kan.
