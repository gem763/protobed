Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period \u2014 pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.\n\nIn interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous \u2014 and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Trump\u2019s aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.", "description": "Detentions have surged as the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive policy toward migrants has collided with an exodus of children fleeing Central America.", "authors": ["Paulina Villegas"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/17/world/00mexico-migrants99/00mexico-migrants99-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
