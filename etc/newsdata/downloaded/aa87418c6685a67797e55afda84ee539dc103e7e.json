Yonhap via REUTERS\n\nAn explosion occurred on the Stolt Groenland, a 25,000-tonne, Cayman Island-flagged oil tanker, at the southern port of Ulsan at around 10:50 a.m. (0150 GMT), a coastguard official said.\n\nThere were 25 sailors aboard, including Russians and Filipinos.\n\nThe fire spread to another oil tanker docked nearby, the 9,000-tonne, South Korean-flagged Bow Dalian, with 21 aboard, he said.\n\nAll of the sailors on both ships were rescued, but 10 people, most of whom were workers at the terminal, have been wounded so far, a fire official told Reuters. Nine of them were South Korean, including one in a critical condition, and the other was from India.\n\n\u201cThe fire has largely been put out but we are checking inside the vessels if there are any flames left or smoke coming out,\u201d the first official said.\n\nAny impact on the terminal\u2019s output or the surrounding environment appears minimal for now as the ships were at the port for repair, he added.\n\nThe Coast Guard is investigating the cause of the incident, officials said.\n\nStolt Tankers, a unit of Oslo-listed Stolt-Nielsen (SNI.OL) which owns the first ship, expressed concern about the incident.\n\n\u201cThe safety of all people on site and the protection of the environment is paramount to the company\u2019s operations,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nNorway\u2019s Odfjell (ODF.OL), which owns the other vessel, Bow Dalian, said the ship had been towed to safety and its crew accounted for.\n\n\u201cOne of our crew members is undergoing treatment for light injuries stemming from the fire,\u201d Odfjell spokeswoman Anngun Dybsland said.", "description": "A fire that spread across two oil tankers in a South Korean port injured 10 people on Saturday, coastguard and fire officials said, adding the blaze had largely been put out.", "authors": ["Hyonhee Shin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434851067&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R051", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
