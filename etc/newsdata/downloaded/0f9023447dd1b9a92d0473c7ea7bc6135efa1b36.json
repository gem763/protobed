September marked only the fifth time in a decade that the service sector reading has fallen below 50.\n\nThe service sector data follows similarly gloomy readings in surveys of purchasing managers in the construction and manufacturing sectors.\n\nIf official economic growth figures for the third quarter published next month show a fall it would mean the UK has suffered two consecutive quarters of contraction, which is the definition of a recession.\n\nIt has been a turbulent week for the markets, with the FTSE 100 index ending up down over 3 per cent last night. At present, the blue-chip index is down 0.64 per cent or 45.42 points to 7,077.12.\n\nAfter taking a dip yesterday, the pound is currently up 0.18 per cent against the US dollar to $1.2315, and up 0.15 per cent against the euro to \u20ac1.1236.\n\nChris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: 'Only the collapse in confidence immediately following the 2016 referendum has seen a steeper overall deterioration in the economy during the past decade, but September's decline is all the more ominous, being the result of an insidious weakening of demand over the past year rather than a sudden shock.\n\nUnder pressure: Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Sajid Javid\n\n'At current levels the surveys point to GDP falling by 0.1 per cent in the third quarter which, coming on the heels of a decline in the second quarter, would mean the UK is facing a heightened risk of recession.'\n\nHe added: 'The increasingly dire readings push the surveys further into territory that would normally be associated with policy stimulus from the Bank of England, suggesting a greater likelihood that the next move in interest rates will be a cut.'\n\nWith both new and outstanding business in the service sector dropping off at the end of the third quarter, companies were the least optimistic about growth prospects they have been since July 2016, when Britain voted to leave the EU.\n\nNew contracts fell for the sixth time this year, albeit only marginally, while backlogs of work slipped for the twelfth successive month and at the fastest rate since January.\n\nService sector: The UK's service sector contracted in September, new figures show\n\nCompanies operating within the services sector also reported that 'heightened uncertainty' around Brexit had led to clients postponing orders.\n\nJobs within the sector were cut for the first time in five months, and at the fastest rate since August 2010.\n\nDuncan Brock, group director at CIPS, said Brexit uncertainty and the global slowdown had hurt client orders and consumer spending.\n\nHe said: 'In this last month before the Brexit deadline, there is little time or vision for a major turnaround in fortunes before the end of the year.'\n\nChris Sood-Nicholls, head of professional services at Lloyds Bank, said: 'Services providers continue to be affected by ongoing uncertainty, and businesses \u2013 and to a lesser extent some consumers \u2013 are limiting spending as a result.'\n\n'The dominant trend from the past few months has been stagnation, and deterioration this month doesn't necessarily change that.'\n\nMeanwhile David Cheetham, chief market analyst at online trading group XTB, said the dismal service sector data rounded off a 'triple whammy of bad news for the UK economy.'\n\nAnother analyst, Neil Wilson, of Markets.com, thinks the Bank of England will cut interest rates on the back of such dismal data.\n\nDominating sector: The service sector spans everything from law firms and accountants to travel agents and waiters\n\nHe said: 'For sure the next move for the Bank of England is to cut rates, as IHS Markit suggest.\n\n'This has been the case for some time, although the MPC has retained its tightening bias in the face of a global slowdown and collapse in government bond yields. Against the tide of global easing from central banks, the Bank of England simply cannot play the Canute here; cutting is the next step unless we see a miraculous bounce back in activity.'\n\nEconomic clouds continue to gather as Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepares to set out his proposals for a Brexit deal in Parliament later.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Prime MInister outlined plans that would see Northern Ireland stay in the European single market for goods but leave the customs union, resulting in new customs checks.\n\nThe European Commission welcomed 'advances' but said problems remained. Boris Johnson has vowed to leave the EU with or without a deal in place on 31 October.", "description": "In its closely watched survey, the latest IHS Markit/CIPS service sector index revealed a sharp fall in activity last month.
