'There are families in need of financial and emotional support from football who do not have time to wait for more studies and research.'\n\nRon Saunders is one of a number of former professional players to suffer with dementia\n\nMoss, who was 70 on Saturday, was diagnosed with Pick's Disease in his 50s long after first showing symptoms. He was given a few years to live but defied the medical projection as he had a fit and athletic body.\n\nHis health has deteriorated to the point where he no longer speaks and requires round-the-clock care from his family. Nikki wants the PFA to consider funding regional respite centres to help the families of ex-players.\n\n'It is hard to believe when you see all the money in football,' said Ronnie Saunders, son of former centre forward and Aston Villa manager Ron Saunders, who has been living with dementia for several years.\n\nThe Jeff Astle gates outside West Brom's Hawthorns stadium: Astle died from dementia, a disease that was ruled to have been caused by repetitively heading leather footballs\n\nHOW DID ENGLAND STRIKER JEFF ASTLE DIE? INQUEST REVEALS HE SUFFERED CTE FROM HEADING LEATHER FOOTBALLS Former England and West Bromwich Albion striker Jeff Astle died in 2002 Former England and West Bromwich Albion striker Jeff Astle (right) died in 2002. He was only 59 but doctors said he had the brain of a 90-year-old after suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). CTE is a progressive, degenerative brain disease found in individuals with a history of head injury, often as a result of multiple concussions. An inquest ruled Astle died from dementia caused by heading footballs \u2013 the first British professional footballer to be officially confirmed to have done so. Astle, who was left unable to recognise his own children, once commented that heading a football was like heading \u2018a bag of bricks\u2019. His family set up the Jeff Astle Foundation in 2015 in order to raise awareness of brain injury in sport. His daughter Dawn said 'the game that he lived for killed him'. Danny Blanchflower, who captained Tottenham Hotspur during their double winning season of 1961, died after suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s disease in 1993. He was 67. His death has also been linked to heading the heavy, leather balls of the 1940s and 50s, along with fellow Tottenham players Dave Mackay, Peter Baker and Ron Henry.\n\n'There should be an established support network for these players who have given their lives to football. They should not be in situations where they have to consider selling their homes to pay for care. To see that is very sad.'\n\nDave Serella, a former centre half for Nottingham Forest, Walsall and Blackpool, was diagnosed with early-onset dementia in his 50s which has since developed into Alzheimer's.\n\nAt 67, he has no doubt about the link between heading the ball and the disease and read with interest the findings of an investigation by experts at Glasgow University, commissioned by the FA and the PFA.\n\nIt is the largest study of its kind and findings released on Monday claimed ex-footballers were three and a half times more likely to die of dementia than others of the same age in the general population.\n\n'The findings haven't surprised me at all,' said Serella. 'There are too many cases for it to be a coincidence. I've been reading about how they're going to make changes with concussion checks and more studies into heading the ball but it's too late for a lot of players.'\n\nFA chairman Greg Clarke urges an introduction of concussion subs as soon as possible\n\nFA chairman Greg Clarke, who will address FIFA on the findings in Shanghai, wants to see concussions substitutes introduced 'as quickly as possible'.\n\nAnd Bobby Barnes, the PFA's deputy chief executive, has said that the union are funding three more research projects.\n\n'We are going to spend and commit to spend whatever is necessary to support our membership,' said Barnes on Monday.\n\nBut this is not going to help the families of the former footballers who are living with dementia, many of whom did not make a fortune from the game.", "description": "Families of former footballers living with dementia are uniting to demand immediate support and action after a major study reinforced links between the disease and heading the ball.", "authors": ["Matt Barlow For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/20/20052152-0-image-a-23_1571773261684.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
