That\u2019s the easiest bit, because you know where it is.\u201d\n\nDespite United's bleak start to the season, Solskjaer claimed he can see progress within his squad, even though results do not reflect that.\n\n\u201cAt times last season, I didn't feel they had the robustness or the mentality at times,\u201d said Solskjaer.\n\n\u201cWe've been working really hard on the physical robustness, the conditioning.\n\n\u201cOf course we\u2019ve had injuries, but maybe that\u2019s part of the process here.\n\n\u201cWhen Jurgen came in at Liverpool, he also seemed to get a few injuries early on, because of the workload and intensity he wanted his team to play with, but you don\u2019t see that any more.\n\n\u201cHe can play with the same 11 every week and we can get there.\u201d", "description": "The Red Devils travel to table-topping Liverpool on Sunday and could end the weekend in the drop zone", "authors": ["David Mcdonnell", "Image", "Manchester United Via Getty Imag", "Empics Sport"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20589872.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Newcastle-United-v-Manchester-United-Premier-League-St-James-Park.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
