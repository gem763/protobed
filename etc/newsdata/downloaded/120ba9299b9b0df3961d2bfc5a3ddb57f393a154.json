How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nA slim 2.2% yield is hard to get excited about, but the long payment history is respectable. At the right price, or with strong growth opportunities, Ringmetall could have potential. There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying Ringmetall for its dividend, and we'll go through these below.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Ringmetall!\n\nXTRA:HP3 Historical Dividend Yield, October 7th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. In the last year, Ringmetall paid out 48% of its profit as dividends. A medium payout ratio strikes a good balance between paying dividends, and keeping enough back to invest in the business. Besides, if reinvestment opportunities dry up, the company has room to increase the dividend.\n\nAnother important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. With a cash payout ratio of 96%, Ringmetall's dividend payments are poorly covered by cash flow. Ringmetall paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough free cash flow to cover the dividend. Were it to repeatedly pay dividends that were not well covered by cash flow, this could be a risk to Ringmetall's ability to maintain its dividend.\n\nIs Ringmetall's Balance Sheet Risky?\n\nAs Ringmetall has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A rough way to check this is with these two simple ratios: a) net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and b) net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA is a measure of a company's total debt. Net interest cover measures the ability to meet interest payments. Essentially we check that a) the company does not have too much debt, and b) that it can afford to pay the interest. With net debt of 2.11 times its EBITDA, Ringmetall's debt burden is within a normal range for most listed companies.\n\nNet interest cover can be calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by the company's net interest expense. With EBIT of 12.75 times its interest expense, Ringmetall's interest cover is quite strong - more than enough to cover the interest expense.\n\nRemember, you can always get a snapshot of Ringmetall's latest financial position, by checking our visualisation of its financial health.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. Ringmetall has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. This dividend has been unstable, which we define as having fallen by at least 20% one or more times over this time. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was \u20ac0.05 in 2009, compared to \u20ac0.06 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 1.8% per year over this time. The dividends haven't grown at precisely 1.8% every year, but this is a useful way to average out the historical rate of growth.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Is Ringmetall AG (ETR:HP3) a good dividend stock?
