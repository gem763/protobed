The lorry\u2019s front grill was smashed.\n\nAuthorities urged users of social media not to jump to conclusions on the motive.\n\n\u201cWe are not ruling anything out,\u201d a spokesman for the state police force quoted by DPA said. \u201cBut we call on you: don\u2019t take part in speculation!\u201d the regional police wrote in several tweets.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Didn\u2019t say a word\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe daily Frankfurter Neue Presse (FNP) quoted the rightful driver of the truck, who was not named, as saying: \u201cA man dragged me out of my lorry.\u201d\n\nHe said the man, in his 30s with short dark hair and a full beard, had yanked open the driver-side door and stared at him wide-eyed before forcing him out of the vehicle.\n\n\u201cI asked him \u2018What do you want from me?\u2019,\u201d he told FNP. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say a word.\u201d\n\nThe newspaper quoted witnesses saying the truck sped into the parked cars before coming to a stop several metres from the traffic light.\n\nWhen the man behind the wheel of the truck emerged from the crash, several passers-by provided first aid, FNP reported.\n\n\u201cThe passers-by said the driver said \u2018Allah\u2019 several times\u201d and spoke Arabic, FNP reported. Police did not confirm this account.\n\nBettina Yeisley from Limburg, whose office is directly next to the scene of the crash, told FNP that she heard a loud bang and ran out onto the street with colleagues.\n\nThey found the man sitting beneath a tree without knowing he had been driving.\n\n\u201cHe was bleeding from the nose, his hands were bloody, his trousers torn. He said that everything hurt. I asked him his name and he said, \u2018My name is Mohammed\u2019.\u201d\n\nGermany has been on alert following several jihadist attacks in recent years claimed by the Islamic State group.\n\nThe most deadly was committed in 2016 by 23-year-old Tunisian Anis Amri, who killed 12 people when he stole a truck and ploughed it through a Berlin Christmas market.\n\nThe Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Germany\u2019s domestic security watchdog, warned in April of an increased risk posed by IS fighters returning from Syria and northern Iraq.\n\nIts director Thomas Haldenwang said that an estimated 2,240 Islamists with \u201cterrorist potential\u201d were living in Germany.\n\nLast Thursday in neighbouring France, a Muslim convert who had reportedly started adopting increasingly radical beliefs stabbed four colleagues to death at Paris police headquarters.", "description": "Limburg (Germany) (AFP) \u2013 A stolen truck ploughed into several cars in the centre of the German city of Limburg on Monday leaving a number of people", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/f3b6c7_stolen-truck-crashed-cars-stopped-red-light-in-limburg-western-germany-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
