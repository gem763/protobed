(Oct. 19) AP Domestic\n\nLONDON \u2013 Prime Minister Boris Johnson is hoping British lawmakers on Monday will vote on and pass a Brexit withdrawal agreement he negotiated with the European Union after a weekend vote was sabotaged by opposition and rebel parliamentarians.\n\nIn an unexpected twist to Brexit's months-long stalemate, parliamentarians Saturday forced Johnson to ask the EU for an extension to his Oct. 31 Brexit deadline.\n\nThey want more time to scrutinize the legislation and to make sure there is sufficient time to implement it so a so-called no-deal Brexit can be completely ruled out.\n\n'Bewildering, disastrous':: Queen has a Brexit escape plan, but how bad will it be?\n\nJohnson was forced by law to send a letter to the EU requesting an extension, which the EU has not yet granted, but he did not sign it and he made it clear that he was against any form of postponement to leaving the 28-nation bloc by Halloween.\n\nNow Johnson wants Parliament to hold the vote on Monday. However, that is up to Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow, who has not yet approved it.\n\nJohnson's government could also try, controversially, to push ahead with implementing legislation for the deal he agreed with the EU by bypassing Parliament.\n\nA vote in Parliament on Johnson's deal is theoretically the last major obstacle to winning approval for Britain's exit from the EU three years after a national referendum that has divided Britain. Theresa May stepped down as prime minister after repeatedly failing to get lawmakers to approve her divorce deal. And her predecessor, David Cameron, resigned after failing to predict the political chaos that Brexit would leash.\n\nJohnson's deal resembles May's, although he has replaced the \"backstop\" \u2013 measures to prevent a post-Brexit return to a \"hard\" border between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom \u2013 with \"alternative arrangements\" that allow some customs checks to take place on the UK mainland.\n\nFrictionless trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland is one of the things that underpins the Good Friday Agreement, a peace deal between the British and Irish governments, and most of the political parties in Northern Ireland.\n\nUnder a so-called no-deal Brexit, many of the laws and regulations that have governed Britain's four-decade relationship with the EU, from trade to security, would effectively evaporate overnight. Economists believe that it would significantly harm Britain's economy and threaten chaos on its borders. The British government claims that it has made adequate emergency preparations to cover just-in-time supply chains on which Britain relies for access to some fresh foods and essential medicines.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/10/21/brexit-boris-johnson-eu-deal-vote-after-parliament-snub/4050791002/", "description": "Boris Johnson wants lawmakers to vote on and pass a Brexit deal after an earlier attempt was sabotaged by opposition and rebel parliamentarians.", "authors": ["Kim Hjelmgaard", "Published A.M.
