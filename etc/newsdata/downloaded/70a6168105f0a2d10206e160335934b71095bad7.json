I\u2019m proud of that. We\u2019re through to the semi-finals and hopefully we can pull it through.\u201d\n\nErasmus credited Bok captain Siya Kolisi, Duane Vermeulen and the other senior players for doing the key talking.\n\n\u201cIf guys miss tackles and there\u2019s a lack of commitment and there are effort errors, harsh words might help,\u201d said Erasmus.\n\n\u201cBut if it\u2019s a bad pass or a missed opportunity or a skill error then it\u2019s more a question of trying to get the guys confidence up and I guess that was the challenge at half-time.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where Siya and Duane and those guys did well at half-time. I think Siya and the boys did most of the talking and sorted that out.\u201d\n\nKolisi said: \u201cThe message at half-time was to be patient and trust our plan. Our maul and our scrum were working. We didn\u2019t take our opportunities in the first half, but we didn\u2019t want to change anything, especially when we got turnover ball.\n\n\u201cAnd in the second half it worked. We got a mauling try and our scrum gave us penalties that gave us points. That was the main message \u2013 stick to the plan \u2013 and having positive chat throughout the game,\u201d said Kolisi.\n\nErasmus was satisfied that the gameplan triumphed in the end.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was a lack of effort in the first half,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt was more the pressure Japan put on us and the amount of effort and intensity that they put onto us in the first half.\n\n\u201cI think we did really well in terms of intensity. But in terms of execution we weren\u2019t that great.\u201d\n\nHowever, the outcome was an effective one for the Springboks as they stretched their record at this Rugby World Cup to four wins from five matches with only three tries conceded \u2013 and 30 scored \u2013 and a points difference of 211 for and only 39 against.\n\n\u201cTwo of those tries were against New Zealand in four minutes, so I think we\u2019ve not had long spells where we were under pressure and we folded,\u201d said Erasmus.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people that see a few holes in our defence. But we really trust our system. Defence is a pretty important thing if you want to try and win a World Cup. But we were certainly tested today.\n\n\u201cTo concede only 10 points in two games against Japan who have got a really good track record in this World Cup, the previous World Cup and the Pacific Nations Cup is good. We\u2019ve got good confidence in our defensive system.\u201d\n\nThat defensive system worked out to plan, with Japan succumbing to the Springboks\u2019 set piece gameplan.\n\n\u201cWe expected Japan to be a high-paced team, a fit team a team that almost announced in the media how fast they wanted to play,\u201d said Erasmus.\n\n\u201cOur team selection was in the first place to see how \u2013 in the tight phases, the scrums, the mauls, the breakdown \u2013 we could physically impose ourselves there and in the same breath how we could contain their speed and the individual \u2018Ferraris\u2019 that they have.\u201d\n\nIt was a particular challenge when the Boks were reduced to 14 men after the yellow carding of Tendai Mtawarira for a tip tackle.\n\nKolisi said the faith in the system had been the key for the team.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of heat coming \u2013 the ball was moving fast,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut the things we pride ourselves in are our defence and work rate and how hard we work for one another. I think that\u2019s what came out in that ten minutes.\n\n\u201cWe knew what we needed to do. We had to work that bit extra but, as coach said, we have been together for so long, those kind of moments are when we pull together; that was one of those moments.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Erasmus identified where the team needed to improve to advance in the tournament.\n\n\u201cWe must find those pressure points and when we get the opportunities, we must utilise them and then don\u2019t give away soft moments,\u201d Erasmus said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when we will have a real chance and be consistent. I think that\u2019s the biggest work-on for us.\n\n\u201cI think we have the pack; I think we have the backline players to go all the way; but I think in a game which is 80 minutes and 40 minutes ball-in-play if you have four or five minutes of ball in play where you drop your concentration, which we did against New Zealand, you get found out.\n\n\u201cThere was three or four minutes against Japan when we almost got caught out. So, I\u2019d say we don\u2019t have to improve that much in specific departments such as scrumming, mauling, lineouts or breakdown.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more to concentrate for the full 80 minutes where we need to improve if we want to try and win the World Cup.\u201d\n\nThe Springboks play Wales in their semi-final on Sunday (kick off 11:00 SA time) at the Yokohama Stadium, after Wales beat France by 20-19 in the first semi-final earlier today.\n\n- SA Rugby", "description": "A strong second half showing from the Springboks helped secure their quarter-final victory over Japan at the Rugby World Cup.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2843/c84dc43454594e92a6730837a1cd173d.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
