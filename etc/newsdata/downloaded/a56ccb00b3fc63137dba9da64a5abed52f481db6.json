In the 1970s, Mr. Lowe played bass in the ill-fated New Wave group Rockpile, pioneered the independent record label as the in-house producer at Stiff Records, and had solo hits with \u201cCruel to Be Kind\u201d and \u201cI Love the Sound Of Breaking Glass.\u201d Later, musicians of the caliber of John Hiatt and Ry Cooder sought out \u201cthe Jesus of Cool.\u201d Yet Nick Lowe, Will Birch writes in this entertaining biography, remains \u201ca cult-throb, singing only to the choir and maybe a couple of stragglers in the churchyard.\u201d\n\nBorn in 1949, Mr. Lowe was the son of a decorated RAF pilot and his musical wife. \u201cNickie\u201d grew up on bases in Germany and the Middle East, where he entertained his parents\u2019 friends on the ukulele. After boarding school in England, the 16-year-old Lowe joined a guitarist schoolfriend, Brinsley Schwarz, in a band called Kippington Lodge, a name right out of \u201cSpinal Tap.\u201d By the end of the 1960s, the band, now called Brinsley Schwarz, were hippies playing what would now be called lo-fi Americana, but what sounded at the time like The Band with the amps turned down.\n\nCruel to Be Kind By Will Birch\n\nDa Capo, 406 pages, $28\n\nBrinsley Schwarz are now remembered only for what Mr. Birch calls \u201cthe sheer audacity\u201d of their failed hype. In 1970 their manager flew a planeload of intoxicated British journalists to New York to witness the band\u2019s American debut at the Fillmore East. The band, \u201cshaken\u201d after their long journey and stoned courtesy of their limo driver, played poorly, and the journalists were not so intoxicated as to miss the weak performance.\n\nThe early 1970s were a hard education for Mr. Lowe, living in a communal farm outside London as the band\u2019s girlfriends tended the vegetable patch, catatonic on LSD while Brinsley Schwarz stagnated on the \u201cpub rock\u201d circuit. But this apprenticeship also taught Mr. Lowe the crafts of songwriting and production. In 1974, he wrote his first masterpiece, \u201cPeace, Love and Understanding.\u201d When pub rock mutated into punk and then New Wave, Mr. Lowe became the sympathetic older brother who knew how the business and the studio worked. He cultivated a blokey, jokey studio manner, oiled by a 50-50 bottle of vodka and orange, but he had a seasoned ear for a hook. The bands called him \u201cBasher,\u201d allegedly for his recording technique\u2014\u201cbash it down and tart it up later\u201d\u2014though Mr. Lowe insists in this account it was a send-up of his father\u2019s RAF slang.\n\nMr. Lowe produced the first British punk single and album, the Damned\u2019s thunderous \u201cNew Rose\u201d (1976) and \u201cDamned Damned Damned\u201d (1977), as well as the Pretenders\u2019 debut, \u201cStop Your Sobbing\u2019\u201d (1979). He produced two albums for Graham Parker and the Rumour, and five for Elvis Costello, including tracks like \u201cWatching the Detectives\u201d (1977), \u201cPump It Up\u201d (1978) and \u201cOliver\u2019s Army\u201d (1979). Somehow, Mr. Lowe also made time to get on stage and onto the tour bus, partnering with Dave Edmunds, the Welsh Chuck Berry, in the mighty Rockpile. They were scorching live, but with Mr. Lowe contracted to Stiff, and Mr. Edmunds contracted to Led Zeppelin\u2019s manager Peter Grant, Rockpile\u2019s records had to be issued as Lowe or Edmunds solo albums.\n\nNow married to Carlene Carter, the daughter of June Carter and stepdaughter of Johnny Cash, Mr. Lowe taught Huey Lewis, then in country band Clover, the rudiments of touring: \u201cYou put your toothbrush in your pocket, you put your skinny jeans on, and you buy a three-pack of clean underwear every three days. We meet in the bar at seven, we get in, we do our thing, we get out. And there\u2019s no whining and no whingeing.\u201d Wining, however, was compulsory. Mr. Lowe would \u201cski down mountains of cocaine into lakes of vodka\u201d (in the parlance of the Rockpile and Costello roadshow), then come home to find Johnny Cash composing at the breakfast table and June Carter Cash wearing rubber gloves with her diamond rings on the outside. Neither Rockpile nor his marriage survived. Albums like \u201cNick the Knife\u201d and \u201cThe Abominable Showman\u201d did not live up to their punning titles.\n\nIn 1983, Mr. Lowe ended a five-year lost weekend: \u201cLose the booze and get yourself a new act,\u201d he told himself. The cooler, older Lowe became a gangly English guest in the inner circle of country songwriting\u2014in Ry Cooder\u2019s estimation, a \u201creal straight arrow-type of cat with a good mind upstairs and plenty on the ball.\u201d Backing in and out of the spotlight with controlled English reticence, Mr. Lowe developed his studio patter into a bantering acoustic solo show.\n\nLike Mr. Lowe, Will Birch is a pub-rock veteran and ex-producer. He is casually expert in the way of those rare music writers who can both play music and write, and his account of life on the road is brutally and comically frank. He likes his subject as a friend, but then, it\u2019s hard not to like a legend who, hearing he\u2019s been offered a spot at a jazz festival in west London, says, \u201cLovely . . . I can get there on the bus.\u201d\n\nNick Lowe is one of the unusual artists whose songs are better known than he is. He was cruel to his fame in order to be kind to his talent.\n\n\u2014Mr. Green is Life & Arts editor of Spectator USA.", "description": "Nick Lowe produced Elvis Costello\u2019s classics.
