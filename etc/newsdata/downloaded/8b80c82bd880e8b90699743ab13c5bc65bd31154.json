That\u2019s a record high. In fact, over half of Americans who own credit cards have debt on them. And part of what gets us into these debt holes are the tempting offers from credit card companies. Hidden fees and reward programs can trick customers into spending more than they otherwise might.\n\nClip: Wow, look at all the signs.\n\nNarrator: And if that balance isn\u2019t paid off in full, those rewards points aren\u2019t going to be worth it in the end.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the reward programs. They offer a variety of benefits, including airline miles, cash back, and points you can put towards shopping. This can be great for customers. I mean, who doesn\u2019t like free stuff? And credit card companies can boost the rewards when you first sign up for the cards as an extra incentive.\n\nFor example, the American Express Platinum card currently offers 60,000 reward points [as of September 2019] if you spend $US5,000 in the first three months. Now, if you\u2019re about to make a big purchase, those points are a nice bonus. But if you end up spending more than you otherwise would just to hit that $US5,000 mark, consider this. One point is typically worth only between $US0.01 and $US0.02, making those 60,000 points worth somewhere between $US600 and $US1,200. So, let\u2019s do the maths.\n\nSay you usually spend $US500 on your credit card per month, and you increase that to $US1,666 for three months to get those 60,000 points. You\u2019ve now spent $US3,500 more than you otherwise would. And, yes, you may get $US1,200 back in points. But that leaves a difference of $US2,300. That\u2019s $US2,300 more that you spent overall and that you\u2019re never getting back.\n\nBut $US1,200 back is the max you\u2019ll likely get. It might be less. And figuring out exactly how much you\u2019re getting for every dollar spent can be tricky. In the AmEx Platinum\u2019s rates and fees section, it says, \u201cThe value of Membership Rewards points varies according to how you choose to use them.\u201d So it\u2019s hard to be sure how much value you\u2019re actually getting. And the eagerness to spend for points can get you into trouble.\n\nSarah Silbert: Obviously, it\u2019s very attractive to get points or miles from your credit card, but if you\u2019re not paying off your balance in full, the points or miles that you\u2019re earning are not worth it.\n\nNarrator: Because you\u2019re going to get hit with that interest charge. A credit card\u2019s interest rate is also called the APR, or annual percentage rate. The APR determines how much you\u2019ll be charged if you don\u2019t pay your balance in full by the due date. On average, the APR for new credit card offers is about 19%. But store credit cards from places like Banana Republic, The Home Depot, and Target have some of the highest rates in the business. And if you\u2019re not paying attention, those charges can add up.\n\nThe average household with credit card debt pays $US1,292 in interest each year. Now, some credit cards will waive interest fees for the first few months to a year. And you might think, well, this is only a problem for people with bad spending habits who don\u2019t pay off their card in full each time.\n\nClip: But there\u2019s a lot more to it than that.\n\nNarrator: Even if you\u2019re responsible with your payments, there\u2019s still other ways credit cards can cost you.\n\nSilbert: There are lots of credit card hidden fees that you could be surprised by if you\u2019re not aware of them. These fees are hidden in the sense that they\u2019re buried in the fine print. They\u2019re definitely documented, and you can find them if you look for them. But they\u2019re not super apparent if you\u2019re just glancing at the credit card application online.\n\nNarrator: Some cards have fees you can\u2019t avoid by diligently paying your card on time. Like a foreign transaction fee. These are fees placed on purchases you make abroad. But they can also be charged on any transaction processed abroad, even if you yourself are not travelling. So, if you\u2019re making a hotel reservation in Bali or buying a cool pair of pants from a Japanese website, you might want to make sure the card provider isn\u2019t charging you a fee to make that purchase.\n\nForeign transaction fees typically run around 3%, so for a hotel room that costs $US150 a night, you\u2019re paying an additional $US4.50. Just think, you could have bought yourself an iced coffee with that money.\n\nOther fees to look out for are balance transfer fees, authorised user fees, late payment fees, and an annual fee. You could get charged an annual fee once a year just for having the card. On some cards, it can be quite high, like the Chase Sapphire Reserve card, which has an annual fee of $US450. Ouch.\n\nBut the Sapphire Reserve also offers a $US300 travel credit and a hefty sign-up bonus, so if you\u2019re using it for travel and are a big spender anyway, it might be worth it. So, with all these sneaky fees and incentives, how do you avoid a credit card bill at the end of the month that\u2019s higher than you expected?\n\nSilbert: The best way to use credit cards is to treat them like debit cards. So that means don\u2019t spend anything more than you can afford, you need to pay your balance off in full, and that way, any rewards that you\u2019re earning are really rewards in something extra.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
