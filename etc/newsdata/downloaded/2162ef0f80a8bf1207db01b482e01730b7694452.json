'I'd have a shisha any day of the week.'\n\n'Awesome. Cheaper than cigarettes. And less tax. Good insight,' another post reads.\n\n'Because they know shisha has become the new trend they are making it look as dangerous as possible,' another commented.\n\nYet another said: 'The health department needs to stay out of this.'\n\nOther comments accused the government of attacking Arabic culture in the campaign.\n\n'Wow, nice way to bash the culture,' one comment reads. 'How about a stupid ad about Australians getting drunk and beating their missus?'\n\nA comment on the campaign video reads that smoking shisha is 'awesome. Cheaper than cigarettes. And less tax. Good insight.' (stock image)\n\nCancer Institute NSW chief executive Professor David Currow told The Pulse that smoking shisha is not a safe alternative for smoking tobacco and that people should be aware of the inherent risks of smoking in any form.\n\n'A person who smokes shisha is at risk of the same health problems that a person who smokes cigarettes faces, including cancer and respiratory illness,' Professor Currow said.\n\n'While these products, also called ''herbal shisha'', may not contain the nicotine in tobacco, the smoke contains highly toxic substances.\n\n'The addition of fruit flavouring and sweeteners does not reduce the harmful effects of the smoke.'", "description": "The advert for the new 'Shisha No Thanks' campaign was posted on the Western Sydney Health Facebook page, to alert people of the risks involved in partaking in a shisha smoking session.", "authors": ["Jackson Barron For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/13/19990766-0-image-a-39_1571662598165.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
