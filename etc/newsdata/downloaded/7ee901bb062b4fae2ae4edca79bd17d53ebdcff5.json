And let\u2019s face it, they\u2019ve been awful. Except for one.\n\nCameron\u2019s sequel to \u201cThe Terminator,\u201d 1991\u2019s \u201cTerminator 2: Judgment Day,\u201d wasn\u2019t just a worthy continuation of the story of an unstoppable killing machine from the future, but also stands as one of the best sequels ever made.\n\nRead more: 18 major Oscar contender movies you shouldn\u2019t miss in theaters\n\nSo with that history, the powers that be decided, while developing the most recent \u201cTerminator\u201d movie, to pretend that \u201cTerminator 3: Rise of the Machines,\u201d \u201cTerminator Salvation,\u201d and (I get chills even writing the title) \u201cTerminator Genisys\u201d never existed. It was time to clean the slate and start fresh \u2026 from \u201cT2.\u201d\n\nAnd \u201cTerminator: Dark Fate\u201d (in theaters November 1) is the redo the franchise needed.\n\nThe movie takes place in a world that never had to deal with Skynet, the company that created the artificial intelligence that birthed the Terminator and wiped out humanity. That reality was made possible by the events of \u201cJudgment Day.\u201d So in this world, the takeover by the machines never happened \u2013 well, by the T-800s anyway.\n\nTurns out other machines rose instead.\n\ncaption Gabriel Luna as Rev-9, a Terminator with an ectoskeleton and endoskeleton. source Paramount\n\nIn \u201cDark Fate,\u201d Legion is the company that created an artificial intelligence that kills off most of the human race. And these machines, known as Rev-9, are pretty nasty. They have a skeleton base like a Terminator but then there\u2019s a liquid surface on top of that which can split off and create its own form. So you are basically always battling two things when confronted by a Rev-9.\n\nIn the movie, a Rev-9 (played by Gabriel Luna) comes from the future to present day Mexico City to terminate Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes), who is a very important person in the future. To protect Dani, a half human/half cyborg named Grace (Mackenzie Davis) is sent from the future. She also gets a little help from Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), who has been on the hunt for signs of the apocalypse for decades.\n\nHow Schwarzenegger\u2019s Terminator plays into all of this get us into spoiler territory, so let\u2019s just say, yes, he\u2019s definitely a major part of the movie.\n\n\u201cDark Fate\u201d is directed by Tim Miller (\u201cDeadpool\u201d), who oversees some great action sequences and \u2013 unlike the previous sequels we no longer speak of \u2013 doesn\u2019t get bogged down in \u201cTerminator\u201d history or time travel.\n\nMackenzie Davis (\u201cHalt and Catch Fire,\u201d \u201cBlack Mirror,\u201d \u201cBlade Runner 2049,\u201d \u201cTully\u201d) continues to evolve as an actress, this time showing that she can play a great action hero.\n\ncaption Linda Hamilton is making her first appearance in a \u201cTerminator\u201d movie since \u201cTerminator 2: Judgment Day.\u201d source Paramount\n\nBut it\u2019s Linda Hamilton who is the true star of the movie. Like her last time in the franchise, \u201cJudgment Day,\u201d she brings a ferocity to the screen that is fun and exciting to watch.\n\nAlso back for the first time since \u201cJudgment Day\u201d is James Cameron, who has a producer credit. It takes a small village to make any movie, but do not for a second think Cameron wasn\u2019t heavily involved in making sure the franchise he created would have a strong rebound.\n\nIt\u2019s also a big rebound for Paramount, the studio releasing \u201cDark Fate.\u201d After the disappointing returns on \u201cGemini Man,\u201d it should be a more profitable situation with this movie, as \u201cTerminator\u201d fans are salivating for a good movie to come their way.", "description": "Business Insider - The makers of the \"Terminator\" franchise canceled out all those lame recent sequels and started fresh with action taking place after events of \"T2.\".
