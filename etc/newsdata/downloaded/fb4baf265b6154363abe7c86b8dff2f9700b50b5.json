Diddy, Puffy and, most recently, Diddy.\n\nNow he has filed to officially change his middle name to Sean Love Combs, dropping the John, according to The Blast on Thursday.\n\nNew moniker: Diddy has filed to officially change his middle name to Sean Love Combs, dropping the John, according to The Blast on Thursday\n\nHe flirted with the idea back in November 2017, sharing a video of himself saying: 'I have some very serious, serious news...I've been praying on this and I've decided...\n\n'I know it was risky cause I knew I could come off as corny to some people...like yo...I decided to change my name again.\n\n'I'm just not who I am before...I'm something different...so my new name is love .. aka brother love.'\n\nAt the time he added: 'I will not be answering to puffy diddy puff daddy or any of my other monikers but love or brother love, ok... it's my birthday I feel good god is the greatest I give all the glory and I thank my momma and daddy.'\n\nDiddy's actual birthday is November 4, so maybe the star felt reborn thanks to his decision.\n\nDapper Diddy: The rapper-entrepreneur donned a white suit and black shirt and tie as he joined Drake's Birthday Party at Goya Studios in Hollywood on Thursday\n\nHowever, he had a change of heart and a few days later he posted a second video saying people could still use his other monikers.\n\n'I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that you cannot play around with the Internet,' he said.\n\n'Due to an overwhelming response from the media out there, and due there not wanting to be any confusion, I was only joking. Okay? I didn\u2019t change my name.'\n\nHowever, this time he actually is changing his name and The Blast has the papers to prove it.\n\nLove will not become final until the petition is accepted and his legal team publish it in a newspaper. As long as nobody objects to the name change, he will then officially become Sean Love Combs.\n\nWhether or not he will insist on being known as Love or Brother Love as he wanted in 2017 is still to be seen.", "description": "He's had more than a few names since he started life as Sean John Combs, including Puff Daddy, P.
