A much-cited Playboy interview from 1971 contains such sentiments as this one: \u201cWe can\u2019t all of a sudden get down on our knees and turn everything over to the leadership of the blacks . . . I believe in white supremacy until the blacks are educated to a point of responsibility.\u201d And this one, on Indians: \u201cOur so-called stealing of this country from them was just a matter of survival. There were great numbers of people who needed new land, and the Indians were selfishly trying to keep it for themselves.\u201d On the \u201cperversion\u201d in Midnight Cowboy: \u201cWouldn\u2019t you say that the wonderful love of those two men in Midnight Cowboy, a story about two fags, qualifies?\u201d\n\nComments\n\nOn the other hand, our nation\u2019s capital is named after a guy who owned slaves, which is worse than saying any of these things in 1971. Many if not most of our heroes had feet of clay. Once we start down the road of renaming things, ripping down statues, destroying stained-glass windows, and the like, we\u2019re going to find it hard to declare when enough is enough. I think we\u2019re mature enough to walk through John Wayne Airport without mistaking it for a monument to white supremacy.", "description": "", "authors": ["Kyle Smith", "Nationalreview.Com Corner Prepare-To-Be-Canceled-John-Wayne"], "top_image": ""}
