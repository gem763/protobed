Heidi enjoyed getting into prosthetics and makeup for the look\n\nOn October 31 fans can stop by the Amazon Book store on 34th street in Midtown starting at 10am to watch as Heidi is transformed into her Halloween costume with the help of Mike.\n\n'This is usually only ever done for movies, so I wanted to show how much work goes into the making of something like this,' she said.\n\nAs for a hint to fans on what she could possibly be this year, the model remained tight-lipped.\n\nFeeling the pressure: 'I put a lot of pressure on myself to come up with something better and better every year,' Heidi admitted about her costume choices\n\n'No hints,' Heidi said, adding she started thinking about this year's costume the day after her Halloween party last year, where she went as Fiona and Shrek with her now-husband, Tom Kaulitz.\n\n'I start thinking about it on November 1. I usually have two or three ideas that I'm playing with and then I decide on one thing,' she said.\n\n'So the next morning, I start thinking, \"Maybe next year, I'm going to do that one that I didn't do this year.\" And then, obviously, throughout the year new ideas pop up because maybe I've seen a new or old movie, or was inspired by my travels.'\n\nIn previous years, Heidi has spent hours, and we mean hours, in the makeup chair to become iconic figures like Jessica Rabbit, a werewolf from Michael Jackson's Thriller music video, and even an older version of herself.\n\nAnd she definitely feels the pressure to upstage herself year after year when another costume is a huge success.\n\n'I put a lot of pressure on myself to come up with something better and better every year,' Heidi admitted. 'I don\u2019t want to let the costume lovers down. I know there are so many creative people out there and fans that are excited to see what I do each year.\n\n'So this one is for all of you and everyone that loves Halloween and loves to dress up as much as I do.'\n\nAnother iconic look: Heidi also enjoyed when she went as cartoon character Jessica Rabbit in 2015, stunning fans with how much she looked like the woman\n\nDecisions, decisions: Starting on November 1, Heidi will start thinking about her Halloween costume for the following year. In 2016 she went as herself (pictured third from left)\n\nThrowback looks: Another thing Heidi has to consider when throwing her annual party in NYC is the venue, making sure it will fit her costume\n\nThis year marks the 20th anniversary of Heidi starting her annual Halloween party in New York, explaining that she decided to first launch the event 20 years ago because there 'wasn\u2019t anything like it in New York City'.\n\n'There were a lot of parties but not \"THE party\" \u2014 the party where you have to dress up to get in. I made that mandatory,' Heidi said.\n\nEveryone is expected to show up to the event dressed all out for Halloween, but no one can ever rise to the level of commitment that Heidi shows every year with her elaborate costumes.\n\nAnd she confessed to having some 'all-time favorites' costumes from past years.\n\n'I loved becoming the older version of myself,' Heidi said, referencing her costume from 2013 where she arrived looking decades older than she actually was.\n\n'I was turning 40 that year and every news outlet kept asking me over and over how I felt about getting older, turning 40, and how much longer I wanted to stay in this business. I looked in the mirror and thought, \"How will I actually look when I am really really old?\", which sparked my idea for Halloween.'\n\nShe added: 'From the prosthetic and special effects makeup stand point, it was probably the most elaborate because any skin that was exposed needed to be aged.\n\n'We totally transformed every inch of me \u2014 from cataract contacts to varicose veins and spider veins to age spots and yellowed teeth to bumpy knuckles, hanging breast and even a turkey neck. It was a lot.'\n\nThis costume took her 12 hours to get into it, but Heidi described all of that time in the makeup chair as 'well spent' based on how the final look turned out.\n\nSpooktacular: This year's event will take place at Cathedrale, a venue Heidi picked for its 'amazing high ceilings'. Pictured is Heidi's costume in 2011 with her ex-husband Seal\n\nGiving back: Heidi (pictured in 2014 as a butterfly) is also partnering with UNICEF this year to help raise money for children around the world\n\nAnother costume she enjoyed was when she went as Jessica Rabbit in 2015. Again she transformed herself to the point of being unrecognizable to mirror the iconic cartoon character.\n\n'I am always up for a challenge and was committed to making Jessica Rabbit more believable,' she said.\n\nLast year's costume was also a 'standout' for Heidi because she had the opportunity to dress up with Tom, who was her boyfriend at the time. The couple went as Shrek and Fiona.\n\n'Driving through NYC in a onion carriage was so much fun,' she said. 'People were smiling and waving at us on our way to the party. I love to ignite more creativity in peoples costumes by fully committing in this way.'\n\nEach year gets more extravagant than the previous one. And when it comes to selecting the venue, Heidi confessed to having to think about getting a place big enough that can also house her costume for that year.\n\n'I usually select a new, fun venue that my costume can fit in. Ceiling heights are always taken into consideration,' she said.\n\nThis year's event will take place at Cathedrale, a venue Heidi picked for its 'amazing high ceilings'.\n\nHeidi also partnered with Trick or Treat for UNICEF this year to support children around the world.\n\n'To date, kids around this country have raised over $180 million to help UNICEF support children around the world,' she said. 'When you see the return on the modest amounts that kids collect on Halloween, it really makes your jaw hit the floor.'", "description": "Every year Heidi takes over Halloween in New York City with her infamous party.
