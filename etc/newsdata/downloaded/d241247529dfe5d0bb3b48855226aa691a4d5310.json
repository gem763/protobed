Frankly, Keeping Up with the Kardashians was robbed and the Emmy committee's silence is deafening!\n\nUm anyway, Kim kept things super simple, by which I mean she wore a bunch of massive diamond necklaces stacked on top of each other, paired with a black Vivienne Westwood dress. While Kendall wore, ya know, this ol' thing:\n\nAnd people have T-H-O-U-G-H-T-S. First of all, plenty of folks on Twitter are confused about why Kendall and Kim are even at the Emmys, which seems RUDE considering they're TV stars on the aforementioned pop cultural legend that is Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\n\nfirst, what the fuck is kendall jenner and kim kardashian doing at the #Emmys ? second, what the fuck is she wearing pic.twitter.com/dvWLKVRN43 \u2014 \ud835\udcdc\ud835\udcea\ud835\udcfb\ud835\udd02 (@barzyhsx) September 22, 2019\n\nKim and Kendall are presenting the reality tv category \ud83d\ude10. Girl i guess #Emmys \u2014 Pippi Loansgotme (@mutual_feelings) September 22, 2019\n\nBut mostly everyone is deeply concerned about Kendall's outfit which a) I love, how dare you all, and b) basically consists of a very sweaty-seeming black latex turtleneck with a floral dress casually/inexplicably placed over it. And the internet is best described as confused?\n\nKendall Jenner combines BDSM latex with a lovely autumn picnic style blanket beautifuly #Emmys#ERedCarpetpic.twitter.com/yp1HQJU7C0 \u2014 Matt Demers (@MrHollywoodMD) September 22, 2019\n\nno one:\n\nkendall jenner borrowing the rubber suit from ahs at the emmys: pic.twitter.com/kipgr4aAIi \u2014 sierra (@silknstyles) September 23, 2019\n\nWhat in God\u2019s name is Kendall Jenner wearing? #Emmyspic.twitter.com/89nrjPazGj \u2014 Trista McGlamery (@tristamac) September 22, 2019\n\nKendall Jenner serving Alice in Bondageland with that latex + floral getup #Emmyspic.twitter.com/LxUDdhT8xr \u2014 Cooper Jackson (@cooperjackson) September 22, 2019\n\nFine, I'll admit it's a look.
