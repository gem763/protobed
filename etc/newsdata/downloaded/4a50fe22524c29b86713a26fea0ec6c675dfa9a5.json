Newsom Signs Bill Forcing Public Universities to Dispense Abortion Drugs", "language": "en", "text": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed a bill into law that requires public colleges and universities in the state to distribute abortion drugs, effectively turning the schools into first-trimester abortion clinics.\n\nOn Friday, Newsom signed SB 24, which was championed in the State Senate by Sen. Connie Leyva (D) as a reproductive rights issue.\n\n\u201cWith Governor Newsom\u2019s signature of SB 24, students at University of California and California State University campuses will finally be able to get medication abortion services at on-campus student health centers,\u201d Leyva said in a statement, adding:\n\nAfter three years of working to expand access to medication abortion at our public universities, I am thrilled that Governor Newsom rejected the misguided paths that other states have taken in limiting access to abortion care. Abortion is a protected right, and it is important that everyone\u2014including college students\u2014have access to that right, if they so choose. I thank the Governor and my legislative colleagues for upholding the right to choose and affirming the right of college students to access medication abortion on campuses here in California. I am also grateful for the many students and advocates that stood alongside me. Without them, today would not have been a reality.\n\nPlanned Parenthood celebrated the new law on Twitter:\n\nBREAKING: @GavinNewsom just signed historic reproductive freedom bills into LAW: AB 1264 & SB 24! These bills, & SB 464, will EXPAND (not ban) access to birth control, abortion, & maternal health care.

On to the lawsuits, and Pro-Life SF is here for it. We will not be silenced and we will win. #NoCampusAbortions #AbortionMandatesAreTyranny pic.twitter.com/WphCFAl0Kb \u2014 Pro-Life San Francisco (@prolifesf) October 11, 2019\n\nStudents for Life of America (SFLA) President Kristin Hawkins said Newsom\u2019s act of signing the bill into law was \u201creckless.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernor Newsom\u2019s reckless support for a new abortion pill distribution scheme on California college and university campuses will put students\u2019 lives at risk and put schools at risk of lawsuits as conscience rights are violated,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Pro-Life Generation will not sit back and watch their college and university campuses be turned into Planned Parenthood\u2019s new money making machine.\u201d\n\nSFLA actively opposed the legislation and testified against it during legislative hearings.\n\nHawkins said SFLA would be assisting students and healthcare workers in California whose conscience rights will be violated as they are forced to participate in abortions.\n\n\u201cStudent fees underwrite the costs of the healthcare centers on campuses, which will now be required to distribute deadly chemical abortion pills,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd healthcare professionals will also be forced to hand them out no matter the consequences to women\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nHawkins continued how the new law is a windfall for Planned Parenthood:\n\nWomen will lose, as the abortion lobby makes bank. This law includes funds that can go to Planned Parenthood for \u201cconsulting\u201d and new funds for \u201csecurity,\u201d allowing the nation\u2019s number one abortion vendor to sit back and cash checks, enjoying the chaos of abortions taking place at schools without any of the risk.\n\nLila Rose, president of Live Action, called Newsom\u2019s act a \u201ctravesty.\u201d\n\nShe said the law \u201cturns universities into abortion centers and perpetuates the lie that women need to kill their children in order to achieve their dreams and goals.\u201d\n\nRose observed pill abortion is not as simple as it sounds. She said the procedure often entails \u201cdays of bleeding and clotting that can have serious complications for the mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cYoung women will be enduring this harmful abortion procedure in their college dorms and bathrooms without proper medical support,\u201d she added. \u201cThis law will only increase the state\u2019s abortion rate. The legislature that pushed this bill has done nothing to support pregnancy, parenting, or adoption which would open up authentic choices for women.\u201d\n\nFormer Gov. Jerry Brown, also a Democrat, vetoed a similar measure last year, stating that forcing the distribution of abortion drugs on all public campuses was \u201cnot necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccess to reproductive health services, including abortion, is a long-protected right in California,\u201d Brown said in his veto message. \u201cAccording to a study sponsored by supporters of this legislation, the average distance to abortion providers in campus communities varies from five to seven miles, not an unreasonable distance.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause the services required by this bill are widely available off-campus, this bill is not necessary,\u201d he added.\n\nA recently released study by researchers at Franciscan University of Steubenville uncovered potential significant biological and behavioral problems associated with drug-induced abortion.\n\nThe study investigated the effects of the abortion-inducing drugs mifepristone (RU-486) and misoprostol in rats in a controlled environment.\n\nBased on the animal models, the researchers found significant and harmful behavior changes in pregnant rats that were given the abortion-inducing drugs, compared to rats that did not receive the drugs and those that received the drugs but were not pregnant.\n\nDr. Stephen Sammut, psychology professor at Franciscan who led the study, said the research is \u201cbreaking new ground\u201d in the area of the mental health effects of abortion on women.\n\n\u201cIn the animal model, we observed depression-like behaviors, and we saw anxiety-like behaviors,\u201d he explained in a statement. \u201cThe biochemistry indicated potentially long-term effects.\u201d\n\nDr. Donna Harrison, executive director of the American Association of Pro-life OB-GYNs, said the study \u201craises serious concerns about mental health effects of drug-induced abortions and the differences between spontaneous and induced abortion.\u201d", "description": "California Gov.
