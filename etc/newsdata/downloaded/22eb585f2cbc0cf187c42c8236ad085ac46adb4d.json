The book, like Williams\u2019s first, is a confused and confusing text, full of clich\u00e9d turns of phrase that match its facile conclusion. (Of his decision to marry a French woman, for example, Williams writes that he \u201cfeared that, like a modern Oedipus, I\u2019d metaphorically slept with my white mother and killed my black dad.\u201d) And yet Williams\u2019s refusal to integrate the work and legacies of certain mixed-race writers and activists into his theorizing seems intentional: He discounts the contributions of biracial people who feel and demonstrate kinship with their monoracial black counterparts. In his book, Williams describes these expressions of intraracial solidarity as farcical at best and harmful at worst. Because of criteria like the \u201cone-drop rule\u201d have their roots in white nationalism, he holds, black people who embrace their own blackness are deluded into accepting their fate as permanently downtrodden. \u201cI am not so ingenuous as to think everyone can want to reconceive themselves, but I do believe the more people of good will\u2014white, black, and everything in between\u2014try, the more the rigidity of our collective faith in race will necessarily soften,\u201d he writes.\n\nThis may sound like an appeal to shared humanity. But Williams\u2019s text whiffs of disdain for black people who take refuge within their own communities, thus\u2014in the author\u2019s eyes\u2014preventing progress. One of the most revealing passages of Self-Portrait comes early on: Shortly after conceding that he, as a light-skinned man, benefits from colorism, Williams writes of meeting Kmele Foster, a brown-skinned man of African descent who refuses to refer to himself as black. \u201cOf course, the most common response to [Foster\u2019s] position is dismissive: \u2018Yeah, okay, that\u2019s all well and good, but wait until you have a run-in with the police, and then you\u2019ll see just how black you are,\u2019\u201d Willilams says, before continuing: \u201cI take seriously the raw pain and historical experience that is behind such an objection \u2026 But this is not an argument; it\u2019s a threat, an appeal to an event that has not yet happened.\u201d\n\nRather than present black people\u2019s objections to Foster as words of caution, the author imbues these statements with a sense of danger. It\u2019s hard to imagine how such appeals could be construed as actual threats: For example, surely a black person familiar with the ugly realities of policing in America wouldn\u2019t call law enforcement on Foster simply to prove a point to him about his own identity. In his attempts to defend Foster\u2019s position, Williams ends up equating black suspicion, teasing, or attempts at self-protection with racist violence.\n\nElevating the snide remarks made by some black people to the same level as racist systems and actions is a curious choice. Drawing that false equivalency is a misguided but perhaps understandable move for a sitcom like Mixed-ish. That show, after all, is set 30 years in the past, and it\u2019s only aired five episodes. There is time for the series to course-correct and catch up to the stakes of its protagonists\u2019 realities: Episode 4, for example, showed Bow learning how difficult it is to trace ancestry on her black mother\u2019s side.\n\n\n\nBut at the conclusion of two memoirs, Williams remains stuck at the level of TV-friendly platitudes. Some readers may encounter Self-Portrait and conclude that Williams, like some other contemporary thinkers, envisions a more egalitarian future, that he wants to others to free themselves from the shackles of racial resentment. But whatever the appeal of his post-racial aspirations, Williams reserves his most ardent frustrations for the black people who will not\u2014or cannot\u2014follow suit.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
