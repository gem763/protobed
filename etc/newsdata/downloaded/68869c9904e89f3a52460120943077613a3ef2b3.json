Perhaps there are technical differences between the deficiencies that render the Death Star vulnerable in the two films, but fundamentally, it can be taken out by Rebel fighters landing a single accurate shot. As the X-wings were to Darth Vader, so Teemu Pukki, Todd Cantwell, Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez and Adama Traor\u00e9 are to Pep Guardiola. For both Darth and Pep, when it goes wrong, it tends to be for the same reasons.\n\nManchester City still in title race despite \u2018nervous\u2019 defeat, says Guardiola Read more\n\nThis is not to suggest Guardiola is inclined to the dark side, or that he is doomed to failure, but just to note that he and Vader share certain characteristics. Both are ambitious technocrats who dream of the creation of an all-conquering machine. Both expend vast amounts of money and expertise in bringing their visions to actuality. Both have created awesome weaponry that can obliterate opponents, whether Alderaan or Watford. Yet both cannot help but leave in their destructive creations a fatal flaw. Bournemouth nearly exploited it. Norwich did and on Sunday, in winning 2-0 at the Etihad, so did Wolves.\n\nPerhaps the flaw is unavoidable. Perhaps it is even necessary for the functioning of the machine\u2019s attacking capability. But it is there, nonetheless. City will rack up huge numbers of goals. They will dominate sides so utterly that they can keep clean sheets by keeping the ball. But they will always be vulnerable to teams who can beat their press, who can run in behind them, who can make their back four turn, who can make their defenders defend.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nA high line lets City control possession and facilitates their attacking might but it always gives opponents a chance. It may even be that that sense of fragility is part of what makes Guardiola\u2019s football, at its best and when you leave aside the grim financial underpinning, so appealing: that it feels doomed, ethereal, transient. Perhaps something in Guardiola, even, relishes that sense of jeopardy. That\u2019s the highfalutin explanation. More prosaically, there is Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi.\n\nManchester misery, Figo in Guildford and lads, it's Tottenham \u2013 Football Weekly Read more\n\nAn issue that was always there for City has been worsened by what increasingly appears the club\u2019s first major recruitment error since the signing of Claudio Bravo. In retrospect, the potential problems in central defence were apparent towards the end of last season. Vincent Kompany played eight of the final 11 games of the league campaign. At the time, the tendency was to regard that as an appropriate farewell for a long-term club captain, and to celebrate how his calmness and authority helped steady any possible nerves among the rest of the squad. While that wasn\u2019t untrue, it perhaps was the case that Guardiola had lost faith in John Stones and Otamendi.\n\nThe injuries to Aymeric Laporte and, to a lesser extent, Stones, have highlighted the folly of the failure to replace Kompany. Otamendi has been badly exposed. Were it just that he was uncomfortable on the ball and struggled with the requirement to pass the ball out from the back, perhaps it would be possible to work round the shortcoming, but, his confidence shot, he now seems to have lost the ability to perform the defensive aspects of the game as well. His lunge towards Jim\u00e9nez as the Mexican striker skipped by him in the buildup to Traor\u00e9\u2019s first goal was evidence of an extraordinary loss of control.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pep Guardiola issues instructions to Fernandinho against Wolves on Sunday.

Injuries mean that Guardiola has repeatedly had to improvise on the left, either with centre-backs (Laporte), midfielders (Fabian Delph and Oleksandr Zinchenko) or a player who would rather be playing on the right (Jo\u00e3o Cancelo). Wolves again and again troubled City with simple balls into the space behind the full-backs.\n\nAs Louis van Gaal has said, the biggest tactical problem for Guardiola is managing the surges of his full-backs so that both don\u2019t go forward at the same time, or, if they do, making sure cover is offered by the deepest-lying midfielder dropping back so the centre-backs can spread. Fernandinho was a master of that but he is having to cover at centre\u2011back while Rodri takes his place at the base of the midfield. On Sunday, the new signing (and it is perhaps more obvious with a Guardiola side because they are positionally usually so good) kept getting caught in no man\u2019s land, neither pressuring the ball nor shielding the centre-backs.\n\nSet plays are another issue, one more directly attributable to Guardiola\u2019s preference for defenders who can pass rather than those who excel in the more traditional virtues. Put it all together and the result is a City that look susceptible in a way they didn\u2019t even during their blip last winter. An issue of philosophical strategy has been exacerbated by questionable recruitment.\n\nIn Star Wars, it needed Luke Skywalker, in whom the Force was notably strong, to hit the vital external exhaust port. By Return of the Jedi, Lando Calrissian and a team of Rebel fighters are enough.
