It\u2019s all very well to mount a barrier, but make sure when you jump off you don\u2019t crash on the other side!\u201d\n\nThe eminent British scientist \u2014 who celebrated his 100th birthday earlier this year and is still going strong \u2014 was laughing at the expense of the Extinction Rebellion activists at Canning Town station in the East End of London, who climbed onto tube train carriages only to be dragged off by angry commuters.\n\nAs a working-class man himself \u2014 and a former radical, anti-fascist firebrand during the Spanish Civil War \u2014 Lovelock was particularly unimpressed at the idea of middle-class green activists trying to stop workers travelling to their jobs by public transport.\n\nAs inventor of Gaia Theory \u2014 the hypothesis that the whole planet (the \u2018biosphere\u2019) can be understood as one, giant, self-regulating organism \u2014 Lovelock is arguably the world\u2019s greatest living environmentalist. His theories have been hugely influential on the deep ecology movement. But as he has got older, he has grown less impressed with the environmental movement\u2019s rejection of science and nature in favour of left-wing political activism.\n\nLovelock\u2019s suspicions were confirmed by an Extinction Rebellion activist, Stuart Basden, who has written a piece admitting that XR isn\u2019t about really about climate.\n\nAnd I\u2019m here to say that XR isn\u2019t about the climate. You see, the climate\u2019s breakdown is a symptom of a toxic system of that has infected the ways we relate to each other as humans and to all life. This was exacerbated when European \u2018civilisation\u2019 was spread around the globe through cruelty and violence (especially) over the last 600 years of colonialism, although the roots of the infections go much further back.\n\nThough Lovelock himself is concerned about \u201cglobal warming\u201d, he doesn\u2019t think that waging war on prosperity is the answer; nor is he a fan of renewable energy.\n\nWhen we met at his idyllic old coastguard\u2019s cottage, on the south coast of England, he told me that he thinks the best and most eco-friendly solution to the world\u2019s environmental problems is the wholesale adoption of nuclear power.", "description": "James Lovelock, the world's most distinguished environmentalist, has come out against Extinction Rebellion (XR).", "authors": ["James Delingpole"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/james-lovelock-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
