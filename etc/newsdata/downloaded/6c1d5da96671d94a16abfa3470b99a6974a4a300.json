It said in a statement that it plans to spend over $200 million a year in the Chicago region on personnel, real estate and other expenses.\n\n\u201cChicago is the heart of American\u2019s transportation and logistics industry, and there is no better place to open our dedicated Freight HQ,\u201d Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said.\n\nThe Chicago expansion is part of Uber\u2019s broader move to branch out into several \u201ctalent hubs,\u201d said spokesman Xavier Van Chau.\n\nLast month the company announced it would open a new administrative hub in Dallas that will bring 3,000 jobs.
