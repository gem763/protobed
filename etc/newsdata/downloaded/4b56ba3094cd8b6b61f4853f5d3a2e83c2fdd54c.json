The day before, he made another slip-up when a reporter asked him for his impression of the New Hampshire city of Keene, which Biden accidentally said was in Vermont.\n\nBut some of his mistakes haven\u2019t been as easily forgotten. Less than two weeks ago, The Washington Post reported that he had exaggerated and jumbled key elements of an Afghanistan war story told while campaigning, getting \u201calmost every detail\u201d wrong, according to the paper.\n\nWaving away criticism over his tenuous grasp of the facts, Biden argued in a interview with NPR\u2019s \u201cPolitics Podcast\u201d that aired Tuesday that the \u201cdetails are irrelevant in terms of decision-making.\u201d", "description": "The former vice president made the gaffe while campaigning for the Democratic nomination in New Hampshire.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d73eb72240000082477c682.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
