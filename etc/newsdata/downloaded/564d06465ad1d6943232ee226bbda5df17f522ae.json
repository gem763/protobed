The police had arrived. Neighbors were screaming. One ran up to her.\n\n\u201cKau\u00e3\u2019s been hit!\u201d\n\nYears into a violent experiment to restore order to one of the world\u2019s most dangerous cities, this is one grim consequence: dead children. As police have used greater force to reclaim swaths of Rio controlled by gangs, they\u2019re killing more of the city\u2019s young.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2017, the most recent year for which demographic data on police killings is available, the number of children and adolescents killed in a police shootout in Rio de Janeiro state more than tripled, from 55 to 193. In 2017, research shows, one of four teenage homicides were committed during a police operation.\n\nNow posters bearing the names of children killed during police interventions ring the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon near Ipanema. Pictures showing children hiding from police inside their homes and schools have gone viral.\n\nEach week seems to bring new deaths. On Friday, it was 8-year-old \u00c1gatha Sales F\u00e9lix, shot to death as she rode with her grandfather in a small bus in Complexo do Alemao, a network of favelas in Rio.\n\nIn a state where police killed nearly 1,250 people through August \u2014 more than five per day \u2014 her death was piercingly familiar. Protesters at her funeral carried signs that read \u201cStop killing us.\u201d\n\nAnd even as the overall homicide rate drops, there\u2019s widespread fear across Rio\u2019s poorest favelas that the number of dead children will continue to climb.\n\nRio is governed by politicians who won office by promising, in increasingly extreme language, to get tough on crime. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said last month he wanted to see criminals \u201cdie in the streets like cockroaches.\u201d Rio state Gov. Wilson Witzel has donned military attire, ridden in tanks and deployed snipers in helicopters to \u201cneutralize\u201d suspected criminals from blocks away.\n\nIn Bangu in May, Simone Barros didn\u2019t see a suspected criminal. She saw her fear realized: Kau\u00e3, shot in the back, lying at the feet of several police officers.\n\n\u201cMy God, what happened?\u201d Barros asked Kau\u00e3.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mom,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not in any pain. Just thirsty.\u201d\n\nNot knowing what else to do, she watched helplessly as the spreading blood soaked his shorts.\n\nBrazil\u2019s politicians promised to get tough on crime. Now police in Rio are killing nearly 5 people per day\n\n\u2018It shoots and people die\u2019\n\nFear of violence dominates life in Rio. Most everyone talks about it all of the time. Who was robbed. Who was killed. The powerlessness people felt as a drug-fueled gang war raged in the favelas, and homicides across Rio state rose 30 percent from 2012 to 2017.\n\nOfficials responded with a level of force that better recalls military operations than community policing. Police arrived in caveir\u00f5es \u2014 armored vehicles \u2014 or helicopters. And the number of killings by police in Rio state skyrocketed, from 419 in 2012 to a record 1,534 last year. The 1,249 shot dead through August have put police on a pace to kill still more this year.\n\nDefenders of this militarized policing say it\u2019s caused homicides to fall \u2014 they\u2019re now at a 16-year-low. But critics say it has caused indiscriminate killing \u2014 and the deaths of innocent children. Some hit in the crossfire between police and drug traffickers, some mistaken for gang members.\n\nOne 12-year-old boy was out getting a snack in March when he was shot and killed by police.\n\n\u201cThings have gotten more aggressive,\u201d said his mother, Luciana Pimenta. \u201cThey\u2019ve become more secure in their cruelty and cowardliness.\u201d\n\nAnother child, this one 14, was running late for school last June when he unwittingly charged into a shootout.\n\n\u201cHe was wearing his school clothes with his school supplies,\u201d said his mother, Bruna da Silva.\n\nPolice and government officials in Rio declined repeated interview requests. They didn\u2019t respond to specific questions about Kau\u00e3\u2019s death or general questions about whether the death of children is an acceptable price to pay to reduce crime.\n\nAfter \u00c1gatha\u2019s death Friday, the state public ministry released a statement. \u201cInappropriate and extralegal use of lethal force by police . . . constitutes a public problem,\u201d it said.\n\nThe Rio government tweeted that it \u201cdeeply regretted her death . . . as well as all innocent victims, during police actions.\u201d\n\nBut on Monday, Witzel blamed recreational drug users.\n\n\u201cThose who use narcotics in a recreational way, think about it,\u201d the governor tweeted. \u201cYou are responsible for the death of the girl Agatha: you who use marijuana and cocaine give money to genocides.\u201d\n\nBrazil\u2019s newest morning TV sensation: Lurid true-crime shows\n\nParents, psychologists and activists say the police killings are remaking childhood in some of the city\u2019s poorest communities. The favelas, which spill across Rio\u2019s hillsides in hues of ash and orange, are largely pedestrian, with few cars and fewer strangers. The streets were once full of children playing. Some parents would leave kids unattended for hours while working in the city, trusting that neighbors would look after them.\n\n\u201cKids would feel comfortable,\u201d said Theresa Williamson, executive director of Catalytic Communities, an advocacy organization.\n\nNow there are fewer children out on the streets. Parents schedule their days around when they think the cops might come.\n\nThe number of police shootings within 300 meters of schools and child care facilities in metropolitan Rio increased more than 50 percent in the first five months of this year, according to the Rio-based think tank Cross Fire. In the favela of Mare, 10 school days have been canceled this year on account of police operations, equaling the number from all of last year, according to the local group Networks of Mare.\n\nIn Brazil, a rare school shooting fuels a familiar debate over guns\n\nThe organization, which is tracking the escalating police violence in its community, in August submitted 1,500 letters written by children to Rio state authorities.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like helicopters,\u201d one wrote, with a drawing of airborne snipers firing on his community. \u201cIt shoots and people die.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hid behind a washing machine,\u201d another wrote, during a recent police operation.\n\n\u201cI lost a cousin to a stray bullet,\u201d wrote one more.\n\nSilvia Ramos, a social scientist at University Candido Mendes, has been studying the effects of this violence.\n\n\u201cThe life of the child in a favela \u2026 is a life of fear,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is it like to wake up to the sound of a helicopter that can gunblast your house or your bed from above, then to see an armored vehicle pass and blast the walls of your home?\u201d\n\nMonica Cunha started a support group for mothers of children killed by police after her own son was gunned down. \u201cYou raise kids who know what it is like to be imprisoned inside their house,\u201d she said. \u201cHe can\u2019t go out, play or socialize in the space where they live. Because at any given moment, the police can come by and start shooting.\u201d\n\nIt was what Kau\u00e3 was told hours before he was shot.\n\nThe boy was far too energetic\n\nThe boy was acting out again. He had just wrecked the residents\u2019 association garden, then arrived home in a brand-new pair of flip-flops he claimed to have \u201cfound.\u201d Now Jocely do Rozario Junior was looking at his son and feeling scared.\n\nOver the last few years, the number of police raids in Bangu, an area scarred by gang conflict, had surged. Drones were now flying over the community. Three men the neighborhood suspected of dealing drugs had been killed by police. A 3-year-old was nearly hit in the crossfire.\n\nBrazil\u2019s largest gang is enticing recruits with a monthly discount and big-brother program\n\nBut here his son was, seemingly oblivious to the danger, still far too energetic, which his parents loved around the house \u2014 \u201che couldn\u2019t see a dirty dish,\u201d his mother said \u2014 but terrified them when he was outside of it. He wouldn\u2019t stop zigzagging his bike up and down the neighborhood\u2019s main drag, no matter how many times they told him to stop.\n\n\u201cYou need to start listening to your mother,\u201d warned Rozario, 34. \u201cThis isn\u2019t good for anyone.\u201d\n\nThe father started to tick through what to do if the police came. Always be aware. Stop whatever you\u2019re doing. Even if you\u2019re scared, do not run.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll think you\u2019re a drug dealer,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything to them is a drug dealer. They don\u2019t see that there are workers here. There are families.\u201d\n\nKau\u00e3 promised he would do better. Rozario put him to bed on the mattress they shared, and in the morning, headed out for a day of fetching taxis for the wealthy people in the city.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until late when he returned. He found a community seething.\n\nThe police had come. Shots had been fired. A neighbor told him he needed to get home.\n\nWhen he got there, he discovered a crowd. There were dozens of people. Not one of them was Kau\u00e3.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not a childhood\u2019\n\nAnother child was dead. And what would have been a national scandal in the United States \u2014 the name Kau\u00e3 becoming another Tamir or Trayvon \u2014 passed here with little notice.\n\nPolice said Kau\u00e3 had been hit by a stray bullet. The family organized an online fundraiser to pay for his burial. It raised $25.\n\nBarros and Rozario now sat in Rozario\u2019s living room, beneath a giant picture of Kau\u00e3, discussing whether they could forgive \u2014 both the police, and themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s a question Rozario can\u2019t shake. When he comes home and sees his son\u2019s bike, when he looks at his kites hanging on a nearby wall: What sort of father can\u2019t protect his son? What kind of man lets a violent death go unpunished?\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t there in the moment when he most needed me, and I\u2019m going to have to carry that for the rest of my life,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I had been there, I would have either stopped it or died with him.\u201d\n\n\u2018Anyone could be a threat\u2019: In Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil, LGBT people take personal defense into their own hands\n\nTheir younger son, Kayo, 9, went to the sink, now cluttered with dirty dishes that Kau\u00e3 would have cleaned and neatly stored, and came back with fruit to pass around. Rozario and Barros looked at him, wondering how to keep him safe.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very angry at the police, so we\u2019re trying to talk him out of it,\u201d said Barros, crying now. \u201cI\u2019m scared of everything. I\u2019m scared even when [the police] look at us.\u201d\n\nThey won\u2019t allow Kayo to go out anywhere alone, not even to the nearby bakery, willing to sacrifice his childhood if it means saving his life. The new rules: No playing on the street. No flying kites. No riding bicycles. No running.\n\nRozario doesn\u2019t know if Kayo\u2019s rules will ever change. He\u2019d seen cops come into the favela recently wearing masks, which convinced him they were no longer interested in policing, but in terrorizing. Another day, he saw officers huddled around a motionless form, and when they left, there was only a pool of blood and single white flip-flop.\n\nHe looked at Kayo, sitting inside, playing video games on his phone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a childhood,\u201d Rozario said.\n\nThe dog is one of the world\u2019s most destructive mammals. Brazil proves it.\n\nGang members behead rivals while guards look on: Inside Brazil\u2019s deadly prison riots\n\nHe\u2019s the Rush Limbaugh of Brazil. He has Bolsonaro\u2019s ear.
