But if home ownership is your goal, it's definitely possible to achieve it with some concessions.\n\nIf you're a first-time home buyer, there are programs designed to help you qualify for a loan. To start, it helps to understand what you'll need to do to buy a house.\n\nHow to buy a house with bad credit\n\n1. Get copies of your credit report\n\nUnderstanding your credit history is key to understanding what's affecting your credit score. Your credit report features details like your personal information, your payment history, and whether you've filed for bankruptcy. Getting your credit report can help you figure out any discrepancies so you can report errors, pay off debts, and boost your score.\n\nYou're entitled to a free credit report from all three major credit bureaus every year. Go to AnnualCreditReport.com to find out more.\n\nIncrease your credit score with help from CreditRepair.com \u00bb\n\n2. Consult a housing counselor\n\nSpeaking with a housing counselor from a HUD-approved agency can help you understand different parts of the home-buying process, such as lending options and how to close on a house, and how your credit score will factor in.\n\nTypically, these are free or low-cost meetings; the goal is to help you understand the nuances of becoming a homeowner. You can search on HUD.gov for HUD-approved housing counseling agencies in your state.\n\n3. Start saving for a down payment\n\nSaving for a down payment will show lenders you're serious about buying a house. Those with bad credit should consider setting aside a larger down payment, as it could help you get a better mortgage rate.\n\nA larger down payment shows the lender that you are more invested in purchasing a home, since you put more money down. While there are mortgages that accept down payments of 3.5%, aiming for higher is best.\n\n4. Review your housing budget\n\nUnderstanding how much you can realistically afford will help you manage your housing costs. It's not only the mortgage you need to worry about \u2014 there are taxes, insurance, home maintenance costs, and potentially HOA fees if you're purchasing a condo.\n\nDon't forget there are also closing fees, which you'll pay when you close on your house, as well as moving costs. If you're unsure of how to work out estimated costs, ask your housing counselor.\n\nSee how much home you can afford using this calculator from our partners:\n\n5. Apply for an FHA or lower-credit-score loan\n\nUnfortunately, with a low credit score, the mortgage you qualify for will likely come with a higher interest rate, which means you'll end up paying more interest throughout the lifetime of the loan. Still, shopping around for mortgage rates, options, and terms is a good idea. Speak to your mortgage broker or housing counselor about your options.\n\nAnother option is to look into an FHA loan, which comes from a traditional mortgage lender and is insured by the Federal Housing Administration. You may be able to qualify for an FHA loan with a minimum credit score of 580 and a 3.5% down payment. However, not all lenders will approve you, as some have higher credit score requirements.\n\nTaking out an FHA loan does mean that you'll need to pay mortgage insurance, also known as a mortgage insurance premium, throughout the lifetime of your mortgage. Mortgage insurance benefits the lender because it insures against the chance that you stop making payments on your loan. Currently, the mortgage insurance premium on an FHA loan is 1.75% upfront, then 0.7 to 0.85% annually.\n\nYou can also look into VA loans if you are a veteran \u2014 the VA doesn't set a minimum credit score, but lenders typically prefer borrowers with at least a 620 score. The same is true for USDA loans, which are available to some borrowers in rural and suburban areas, though lenders tend to prefer borrowers with a score of 640 or higher.\n\n6. Work on rebuilding your credit\n\nIf you find that you can't qualify for a loan, you'll want to take steps to become more creditworthy. Review your credit report again to see what is impacting your credit score, then take steps to improve it. Consider decreasing your debt-to-income ratio by increasing your income, paying off debts, or both.\n\nConsider using credit monitoring tools\u2014 there are free tools, some provided by your credit card issuer \u2014 so you can keep track of your credit score and figure out when it's time to apply for a home loan.\n\nRelated coverage from How to Do Everything: Money", "description": "It's possible to buy a house with bad credit, but you will likely end up paying a higher mortgage rate.", "authors": ["Sarah Li Cain"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d603a6f91b6f679913fbb38-1920-960.jpg"}
