REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino/File Photo\n\nThe latest official count showed Morales with 46.49% of the vote, with nearly 97% of the ballot processed. That puts him 9.5 points ahead of main rival Carlos Mesa, but still short of the 10-point lead needed to win outright and avoid a riskier second round run-off.\n\nIn a fiery early-morning speech at the government office in capital city La Paz, leftist Morales criticized recent violence that saw electoral offices torched and skirmishes between protesters and police, which he blamed on the right-wing opposition and what he described as their foreign backers.\n\n\u201cI have called this conference to denounce, in front of the Bolivian people and the entire world, that a coup d\u2019etat is in progress. In advance, the right had prepared with international support for a coup,\u201d he said.\n\nProtesters, angry at what they saw as an attempt by Morales to rig the vote, had protested en masse in La Paz, outside where the electoral board was processing the last remaining ballots with the president edging toward outright victory.\n\nUnrest in the country began after an official quick vote count was disrupted by a near 24-hour halt late on Sunday, when Morales claimed his party would win outright despite initial numbers showing the two main rivals heading to a second round.\n\n\u2018WHAT\u2019S HE AFRAID OF?\u2019\n\nThe tensions mark the most severe challenge to Morales\u2019 near 14-year rule of the land-locked nation, since he came to power in 2006 as the country\u2019s first indigenous leader.\n\nThe former union leader for coca farmers has overseen relative stability and growth, but angered many by running for a fourth consecutive term in defiance of term limits and a 2016 referendum that voted against him doing so.\n\n\u201cIf he wants to be elected cleanly, he should accept a second round election. What\u2019s he afraid of?\u201d asked Maria Luz Vargas, 65, a newspaper seller in La Paz who closed up her kiosk early on Tuesday to join the protests.\n\nThe official election monitor, the Organization of American States (OAS), called the count into question, saying there had been a \u201cdrastic\u201d and inexplicable shift in the vote, which hurt voters\u2019 confidence in the electoral process.\n\nRelated Coverage Brazil president urges recount of Bolivian vote after Morales claims win\n\nA number of foreign governments, including the United States, Brazil and the European Union, voiced concerns about the integrity of the vote.\n\nMorales, often known just as \u201cEvo,\u201d called on his supporters, especially in rural areas, to help \u201cdefend democracy,\u201d adding he was convinced that when the final vote count was announced he would have a clear first-round win.\n\n\u201cOur triumph has always been with the votes from the rural areas with the votes of the indigenous movement,\u201d he said, adding he would respect the final result.", "description": "Bolivian leader Evo Morales on Wednesday repeated his claim of victory in a presidential election and accused the opposition of trying to orchestrate a coup, after mass opposition-led protests since the Sunday vote that claimed the counting was rigged.", "authors": ["Mitra Taj", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444093751&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M11C", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
