She'll sit down and just have one little bit of mousse a bit of lettuce leaf.\"\n\nOn The Jonathan Ross Show, Jeremy revealed that he'd taken some time out to go abroad, and that had helped him get a handle on his physique.\n\nThe driving expert said: \"I went on a gap year! I went on a gap year to Indochina. They just have a better diet out there.\n\n\"Plus I had a bicycle rather than a car. Cycling is not a good thing to do, I'm all broken as a result of it but I did lose a lot of weight. Where I was staying was separated from the small town by a mountain but it was much bigger than Everest.\n\n\"It was only three kilometres and I cycled it every day. I said, 'I can't have a drink unless I cycle into town.' I wanted to get fit.\"", "description": "Jeremy had the shed the pounds by using the Queen's technique of only eating a tony amount and keeping it healthy", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Dave Benett Getty Images For Ldv", "Bbc Hat Trick Richard Kendall"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20638377.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_The-Launch-Of-Fatima-Bhuttos-Book-New-Kings-Of-The-World-At-Nolita-Social.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
