Photo: Joan Marcus\n\nLeah C. Gardiner\u2019s handsome production of Ntozake Shange\u2019s for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf, now at the Public Theater, is a revival in three senses. First, the obvious: Shange\u2019s choreopoem (a mixture of poetic monologue, dance, and song) is a classic, now brought back to one of its original venues after 43 years away. The Public\u2019s 1976 production, which went on to Broadway and then great fame, was beloved, and that love then carried the text deep into the American theater\u2019s veins. Many of us who know it encountered it in college, where teachers (poets, academics and practitioners alike) administered it to us like a drug.\n\nSecond, it revives the woman Paulette Williams herself, the radical activist-artist who took as her chosen names Ntozake (\u201cShe Who Comes With Her Own Things\u201d) and Shange (\u201cShe Who Walks With Lions\u201d). Shange died last year, still hoping to see this production staged. But the show speaks so clearly in her voice that she seems to be standing somewhere just beyond the set\u2019s mirrored walls, calling out. The power of for colored girls has always been the way it maintains the whispered quality of poetry\u2014a poem establishes a spoken-in-the-mind bond between word and reader\u2014despite all the hurly-burly that showmanship demands. Some of the show\u2019s monologues are written from the perspective of a version of Ntozake; some are clearly built around characters. But all of them have a particular intensity, a way of coming direct from author to audience. In moments, Shange walks with us again.\n\nThird, thanks to Gardiner\u2019s intimate staging, it is a revival-as-service, a quasi-religious sharing circle gathered in the Big Tent. The audience is close, some of it even onstage: Set designer Myung Hee Cho turns the room into a backroom club, mirrors on the walls and groovy disco balls above. (In a charming moment just before the show begins, the disco balls swoop up into the ceiling, just as the chandeliers do at the Metropolitan Opera.) Each performer, identified only by the color of her dress, trades position as priestess and congregation; when one speaks, the others mainly stay onstage, sitting and watching, affirming one another. In the show\u2019s bravura aria by the Lady in Red (Jayme Lawson), the story careers into devastating, unmediated pain. The day I saw it, the Lady in Purple (Alexandria Wailes) felt such vicarious grief at it that the Lady in Green (Okwui Okpokwasili) took her hand.\n\nShange\u2019s poetry is as keen as it was nearly a half-century ago, but it\u2019s this turning-towards-one-another quality that makes the show so rich. The poems are about the wounds of black womanhood: as the Lady in Yellow (Adrienne C. Moore) says, \u201cbein alive & bein a woman & bein colored is a metaphysical dilemma / I havent conquered yet.\u201d The Ladies tell stories about joyful sexual awakening, but also about rape; they tell stories about confident, big-spirited women who cry themselves to sleep. Yet once the wounds are spoken about and danced about, they turn into healing balms. The Lady in Blue (Sasha Allen) sings some of her text\u2014the newly composed music is by Martha Redbone\u2014or the women dance together in Camille A. Brown\u2019s ecstatic choreography, and you watch them holding each other up. The audience has its experience, certainly, carried along by sound and courage and beauty. But this one is for the Colored Girls in the show: At every performance, they are the rainbow, and they are enough.\n\nEven though I\u2019ve just recommended that you go see for colored girls (recently extended!), I\u2019m going to also need to insist that you see Is This A Room. I wrote about it at ArtForum earlier this year, when it was at the Kitchen for a short run back in January. That experience short-circuited my brain: It was a total surprise to see the wicked ironists of Tina Satter\u2019s company Half Straddle convert suddenly to political theater, and I remember feeling light-headed and a little high from their ozone-sharp sense of outrage. When I learned that the show would move to the Vineyard for a longer engagement, I was thrilled to see it again\u2014it contains one of my favorite pieces of performance ever. Pencils down, voting over.\n\nThe stagecraft decisions are extremely simple. Director/conceiver Satter took the transcript from Reality Winner\u2019s 2017 arrest and used it verbatim as her short, sharp text. (Winner, if our daily political crises have made you forgetful, is the intelligence specialist who leaked a document that confirmed Russians had hacked our voting machines.) When there are redactions in the record, the actors fall silent and the lights swell a little; if an entire page is blacked out, the stage goes dark. The rest of the time, Reality (Emily Davis) and the FBI officers (Pete Simpson, TL Thompson and Becca Blackwell) say only what was actually said\u2014odd and ordinary things, self-incriminating things, devastating things, and jokes.\n\nI was happy to see that even without the element of surprise, Is This A Room punches hard. Sophocles couldn\u2019t devise a better tragedy (a woman, preoccupied with good citizenship and right action, walks backwards into danger), and we usually have to look to the Coen brothers for this kind of awkward comedy (Simpson\u2019s nerdball FBI dad is Fargo crossed with Ed Grimley). Hell, you\u2019d need to ask Kafka to come up with a character and a setting this brilliantly perverse\u2014the uptalking girl, wearing Pikachu sneakers, terrified that somehow she\u2019s going to frighten the trio of armed men. Yet this is reality, right? This is Reality.\n\nThe show hasn\u2019t changed much since January\u2014it still takes place in backlit fog (Thomas Dunn did the lighting design), and the show\u2019s power still comes from its juxtaposition of the clownish FBI dudes with the shuddering, deeply felt Davis. At the curtain call, she is still shaking; hell, I was still shaking. In January, I said that her performance made me feel \u201cconcussed,\u201d and, ten months later, here she is performing like a grenade with the pin pulled. Did you know that Winner is still in prison, serving the longest sentence ever given for releasing government information to the media? Davis clearly knows it; and it\u2019s traumatizing her. In her skinless, electrifying performance, we see the cost of such shamanistic channeling. It feels almost dangerous to let her do it, but here in the U.S.A., if you want to tell the truth\u2014you\u2019ll need to suffer.\n\nfor colored girls who have considered suicide / when the rainbow is enuf is at the Public Theater through December 1.\n\nIs This a Room is at the Vineyard Theatre through November 10.", "description": "Theater Review: Ntozake Shange\u2019s \u2018for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf\u2019 at the Public Theater", "authors": ["Helen Shaw"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/22/22-for-colored-girls.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
