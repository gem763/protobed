Biden on Wednesday again defended mixing up details in a story he\u2019s told about a soldier refusing a medal, saying the details do matter when you\u2019re talking about things that have yet to happen.\n\nThe 2020 Democratic presidential front-runner said on CBS\u2019s \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d that it\u2019s fair to go after political figures.\n\n\u201cBut here\u2019s the deal: any gaffe that I have made \u2014 and I\u2019ve made gaffes, like every politician I know has \u2014 have been not about a substantive issue. \u2026 I\u2019m trying to talk about what other people have done,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Biden said people are making a \u201cbig deal\u201d about a story he\u2019s told about a soldier refusing a medal in which he apparently conflated separate events and mixed up details into one incorrect narrative.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the deal, because I was not talking about me \u2014 I was praising the valor of all these people out there that I visited in over 20 visits to Afghanistan and Iraq and I\u2019ve watched these people and I\u2019ve watched what they\u2019ve done,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd I was pointing out that the young man who I did pin the medal on \u2026 he didn\u2019t want the medal because his buddy had been killed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo look, it\u2019s a different thing to say when you\u2019re talking about honoring the bravery or the sacrifice or what other people went through and the essence of it is absolutely true,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that I said that I was vice president \u2014 well, in one case I was vice president-elect; the other case I was a senator. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s relevant.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get wrong things like we should lock kids up in cages at the border,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Biden doubled down on comments he had made to NPR, saying: \u201cThose details are irrelevant when the point I was making is absolutely accurate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe devil lives in the details if the details that you\u2019re talking about would affect the outcome of something that is about to happen or should happen,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Colbert had also read a list of some of Mr. Biden\u2019s recent verbal misfires, including mixing up New Hampshire and Vermont, saying Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy were assassinated in the 1970s, and making clear that he wasn\u2019t \u201cgoing nuts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, look, the reason I came on the Jimmy Kimmel show is because I\u2019m not,\u201d Mr. Biden joked after Mr. Colbert asked him if he was \u201cgoing nuts.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
