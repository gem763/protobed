It now appears that Instagram made a mistake: Spokespeople for both Buffer and Hootsuite have told Business Insider that the issue has been resolved, and their services are running as normal.\n\n\u2014Help Each Day (@help_each_day) September 10, 2019\n\nAn Instagram spokesperson declined to comment, but Buffer and Hootsuite remain listed in its official list of Facebook Marketing Partners, an exclusive catalog of Facebook-vetted advertising and marketing firms, as does Planoly, another company whose users were affected by the warning. (Facebook has previously promptly removed companies it believes are engaged in rule-breaking behaviour from the list.) Planoly did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nThe affected companies are popular among brands and media companies who use them to manage their social-media presences and marketing campaigns. Buffer, for instance, which is used by Business Insider, provides a unified dashboard to schedule posts across various social-media accounts, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram.\n\nInstagram's erroneous warnings are a further indicator of its ongoing struggles to accurately enforce its rules for third-party developers on its platform. They highlight how even its attempts to rectify matters can produce further mistakes, cause confusion for ordinary users, and risk damaging innocent and trusted partners' reputations.\n\nHailley Griffis, a spokesperson for Buffer, said: \"I'm happy to report that the issues we were seeing are now fully resolved. Instagram implemented a fix for the issue and we are no longer seeing this error on our end.\"\n\nA Hootsuite spokesperson said: \"Hootsuite has just been alerted that the Instagram technical issue has been resolved. Facebook confirmed that some Instagram accounts were blocked in error, including those from Hootsuite users. They've since fixed the issue and have apologized for the confusion this may have caused. We appreciate your readers' patience during this time as we worked closely with Instagram to get this matter resolved.\"\n\nInstagram has started to clamp down on third-party apps, issuing cease-and-desist letters to alleged rule-breakers, and kicking off a review of all of its Facebook Marketing Partners in August.\n\nDo you work at Facebook/Instagram, or a company that interacts with it?
