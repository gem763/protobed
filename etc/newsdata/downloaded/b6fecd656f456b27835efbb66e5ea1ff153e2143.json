They remain in detention awaiting deportation to the UK amid fears for the welfare of the three children involved.\n\nSince the family were arrested they have been subjected to an ordeal that Eileen said would leave them \u201ctraumatised for the rest of our lives\u201d. She made the comments in a statement that forms part of a legal complaint against the US Department of Homeland Security about their treatment.\n\nIn a statement, the Foreign Office said: \u201cWe are providing assistance to a British family after they were taken into custody in the US and are in close contact with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\u201d\n\nEileen Connors\u2019 statement was released by her lawyer, Bridget Cambria, from Aldea \u2013 the People Justice Center \u2013 an organisation that provides legal help to immigrant families to the US.\n\nAn email to the Guardian from an unnamed staff member at Aldea said the case exposed the poor treatment facing many migrant families in the US.\n\nThe email said: \u201cWhile we are conscious of the extreme vulnerability of this child due to his young age, we would take this opportunity to highlight that there are approximately eight children under the age of five, half of them two years of age or under (including the British citizens), in a facility that is not licensed by the state to hold children.\u201d\n\nUS Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) insisted that the Connors were being held in \u201ca safe and humane environment for families\u201d. In a statement to the Guardian it said it was \u201cunequivocally false\u201d to suggest that conditions were inhumane.\n\nIn her statement, published by the Philadephia Inquirer, Eileen said the US police ignored protestation of innocence and ignorance of crossing the border. After they were arrested, David and Michael were separated from their wives and children, it said. For the first night Eileen was held with her baby in a women\u2019s cell with only foil blanket to keep warm, the statement claims.\n\nDespite being told they would be released to a family member in the US, David, Eileen and their son were then taken to a detention centre in a journey she likened to \u201can abduction or kidnapping\u201d. David was then held in the centre while she and the baby were put up in a hotel in Seattle. Eileen\u2019s statement only describes her treatment and that of her husband and son.\n\nBut it is understood that all seven of the family were flown 2,400 miles from Seattle airport to Pennsylvania on 5 October and taken to the Berks county residential center, one of three places in the US used to hold migrant families. Campaigners, including Aldea, the organisation now representing Eileen, have labelled it a \u201cbaby jail\u201d which they say is not fit to hold children.\n\nIn her statement Eileen complained about the cold and filthy conditions at the centre where she and her baby were given bedding that smelled \u201clike a dead dog\u201d. She said her baby boy\u2019s eye became swollen and his skin blotchy while in the centre. She was also told she could be separated from her baby.\n\nHer statement said: \u201cWe have been treated like criminals here, stripped of our rights and lied to \u2026 We will be traumatised for the rest of our lives by what the US government has done to us.\u201d", "description": "Four adults and three children were held in \u2018baby jail\u2019 in what they call \u2018scariest experience\u2019 of their lives", "authors": ["Matthew Weaver"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72fc8c71fd78e3ecb42a06ae6008965a57d75262/0_79_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8535a4d0528f27f25328fc176709a823", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
