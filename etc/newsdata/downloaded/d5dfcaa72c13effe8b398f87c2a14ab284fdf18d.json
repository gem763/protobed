Based on looks alone, it might appear that not much has changed. Each ear piece is still capped in a premium pearlescent design, and they ship in a heavy, glossy stainless steel case that looks luscious when it\u2019s brand new, but will almost certainly get scratched up when it\u2019s not tucked into the included cloth pouch. M&D states that these use the same 10mm beryllium drivers from the previous model (which are still fantastic), but a few new features might make their high price an easier sell.\n\nThese support active noise cancellation, activated by tapping and holding the volume up button on the left earbud. They also feature an ambient listening mode to let you hear what\u2019s happening around you, switched on by pressing the volume down button for a few seconds. In the few days that I was able to test out the MW07 Plus, both features made the experience better than before, and surprisingly, neither negatively impacted the sound quality.\n\nOur review of Master & Dynamic MW07 Plus Verge Score 7 out of 10 Good Stuff Vastly improved battery life\n\nEffective noise cancellation\n\nExciting sound quality Bad Stuff Still very expensive\n\nCan only pair to one device at a time\n\nThe very scratch-prone case requires careful handling\n\nDivisive design\n\nGranted, these features aren\u2019t as robust in their ability to isolate you from your environment like what you\u2019d experience in a set of over-ear headphones, but they\u2019re effective enough at dampening most of the debilitating whirring and grinding of trains passing through a subway station. They also do a good job of silencing chatter and clattering train noises when I\u2019m on my commute so I can focus on my music, or so I can focus on a book with some silence when my music is paused. I haven\u2019t been on a flight with these earbuds yet, so I can\u2019t speak to how they\u2019d hold up on a plane. But short of using them to get sleep, the noise-canceling effect seems sufficient enough to at least hush the whir of airplane engines while you\u2019re watching a movie or listening to music. Part of why the noise cancellation works so well here may be because M&D doubled the amount of microphones in the MW07 Plus to four.\n\nI\u2019ve used M&D\u2019s over-ear headphones before, and one of the things that I enjoy most about them is their attack. They aren\u2019t going for a balanced, neutral sound. Instead, music sounds energized, with the mids and highs seemingly amped up in unison to make for an exciting listen. Surprisingly, very little from that sound profile has been lost in translation to the truly wireless headphones form factor. My favorite songs are richly presented, and again, the noise-cancellation feature is surprisingly effective at dimming down some of the ambient sound \u2014 even in the subway.\n\nOne of the things that I don\u2019t necessarily enjoy is their design. While Google and other companies are racing to make truly wireless headphones that disappear in your ears, M&D seems to be doing the opposite. Both the MW07 Plus and Go resemble hefty in-ear monitors used in the studio or onstage. Their outside casing is flat, thankfully, but it still looks like a serious bit of hardware is hanging out of your ear. There are some upsides to the design. M&D made both of these headphones in multiple colors (the Plus\u2019 options are all pearlescent, while the Go\u2019s are rich pastel colors), so you can pick your favorite if you buy them. Additionally, they\u2019re much more comfortable than their appearance might indicate. There\u2019s a large assortment of ear tips and ear fins included, and after a few attempts, I was able to find a comfortable fit that makes a good seal and doesn\u2019t push too hard on my cartilage.\n\nThe design is divisive, but a few of its other improvements are great. The MW07 Plus buds have vastly improved battery life, both in the earbuds and in the included charging case. M&D claims that you\u2019ll get 10 hours of battery life per charge, and the case can recharge them fully three more times, totaling 40 hours of playback (compared to 10.5 hours total in the previous generation\u2019s case). I\u2019ve been testing them for the past week during work days, on my commutes, and around town on errands, sticking the buds back in the case to charge them after each listen, and I haven\u2019t had to recharge the case yet.\n\nThe colored LEDs on the case indicate how much battery life remains (green means good, orange is medium, red is low), and the case has delivered something very close to its 40-hour claim, and that\u2019s a huge improvement. It maintains the USB-C port from last year, so you can use the same cable as your laptop or phone to charge it back up. The case\u2019s lack of wireless charging support is a much bigger issue now than it was when the original MW07 released. Several less expensive options include wireless charging, so it\u2019s disappointing not to have it here.\n\nThey cost a premium, yet they lack some premium features available in less costly alternatives\n\nThe list of improvements in the MW07 Plus is long, and there are a few more that you should know about. They are rated IPX5 (the MW07 were IPX4), so they should hold up well to sweat, as well as rain if you get caught up in a brief shower storm. This model has Bluetooth 5, allowing for longer range (up to 100 feet), and they support Qualcomm\u2019s aptX codec. Lastly, you can use either the left or right earbud independently for playback or phone calls. The MW07 model was limited to just the right earbud if you needed to use just one.\n\nOur biggest complaint about last year\u2019s MW07 earbuds was their price, and we argued that even though they provide better sound quality than most of the competition (at least, back in mid-2018), the value just didn\u2019t pan out. It might seem puzzling that Master & Dynamic kept the same price with the MW07 Plus, but it considerably fleshed out what\u2019s on offer. However, not everything is great. These only allow you to pair them with one device at a time, and their high $299 price makes cheaper, similarly capable options more appealing, like Sony\u2019s WF-1000XM3 (I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m referring to $229 headphones as cheap). You don\u2019t have to pay $299 to get good noise cancellation, a USB-C charging case, and excellent sound quality, but it\u2019s a worthy investment if you value a stylish presentation.\n\nThe other new set of M&D earbuds address the price complaints more directly. The MW07 Go are $100 cheaper than the new model or last year\u2019s version, but they make some clever compromises to reach that lower price point. The stainless steel case is replaced with a smaller case that\u2019s clad in woven fabric, somewhat like Google\u2019s original Pixel Buds. Physically, the MW07 Go are a smaller set of buds than the Plus, but largely look the same, down to the button location and the same 10mm drivers. They don\u2019t have proximity sensors, which allow the high-end MW07 Plus to automatically resume or pause music when you put them in your ears.\n\n(Note: Master & Dynamic provided a production sample of the MW07 Go to The Verge, and noted that they lack a few quality-of-life tweaks that M&D promises in the final product. However, not having them didn\u2019t impact my overall experience, and I don\u2019t expect my feelings to change much once the headphones hit shelves. I\u2019ll be testing the final product once M&D provides it, and if any discrepancies pop up, I\u2019ll be sure to note that.)\n\nOur review of Master & Dynamic MW07 Go Verge Score 7 out of 10 Good Stuff Same great sound as the more expensive MW07 Plus\n\nSlightly more reasonable $199 price\n\nCompact charging case Bad Stuff Still more expensive than most other recommended options\n\nNo wireless charging case\n\nDivisive design\n\nGiven that the case is smaller, its battery capacity takes a hit compared to the Plus. It has just a 12-hour capacity, allowing it to recharge the Go from empty only once (with a little juice left over). Fortunately, the Go\u2019s playback time is 10 hours per charge, just like the high-end model.\n\nAs for what the rest of the MW07 Go earbuds offer, only some of it\u2019s on par with the Plus (Bluetooth 5.0 support with aptX codec). These have fewer microphones than the Plus, they lack the ambient listening mode and active noise cancellation, and only the right earbud will work independently. If you\u2019re not someone who has to drown out a lot of noise, these might be a suitable option for you. The sound quality is just as good as the MW07 Plus, but for $100 less.\n\nLike the MW07 Plus, the Go can only pair with one device at a time, which is frustrating if you regularly move between a phone and tablet or laptop and want your headphones to come along for the ride. But compared to most other non-AirPods, these offer specs and capabilities that are on par with, and in some cases, better than, other options. Compared to the Jaybird Vista earbuds, these are similarly priced, have longer battery life per charge, and their aptX codec support runs laps around the Vista\u2019s lousy SBC support. But given that the Jabra Elite 75t and Amazon\u2019s Echo Buds are about to launch, those perks may not set M&D\u2019s new MW07 Go apart for long.", "description": "Master & Dynamic\u2019s new MW07 Plus and MW07 Go truly wireless headphones contain unique features, but at $299 and $199 respectively, they don\u2019t offer nearly enough to make them a better choice than less costly alternatives.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/okgS3IKh3kF6F5fndhSH_MAnqCs=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19293842/akrales_191016_3736_0047.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
