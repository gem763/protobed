To make matters worse, the judge adjourned court for the day, meaning Bella will have to face up to Tommy in the flesh for a second time tomorrow.\n\nHaving already struggled to give her testimony to the lawyer in front of her attacker, and with Colby\u2019s disturbance making the situation even harder, Bella is in a bad place and lashes out at her older brother, saying she doesn\u2019t want him there tomorrow. Devastated, Colby calls up Willow (Sarah Roberts) and asks if she will go in his place. She\u2019s reluctant, and thinks he should talk Bella round, but Colby wants to do right by what his sister wants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWillow takes matters into her own hands and talks to Bella, telling her she will get through this situation by focusing on the people who matter. Instead of thinking about Tommy \u2013 or even looking at him \u2013 in court, she should focus on the one person who has been by her side throughout the whole process: Colby.\n\nIrene was also shocked when Tommy showed up in court (Picture: Seven)\n\nThe next day, Bella takes Colby with her to court, having taken on Willow\u2019s advice. However, she, Irene and Leah are surprised to find a sudden flood of support outside the court in the form of Irene\u2019s survivor group. They have shown up with chants and placards in order to support the women on this important day.\n\nBella takes the stand again, with Tommy present for a second time in his wheelchair. When the lawyer begins to ask her questions about what happened between her and Tommy, she hesitates and has to dig deep. Will she freeze in front of Tommy, or will she find the courage to speak out about what he did?\n\nMORE: Home and Away spoilers: Karen asks Maggie if she can sleep with Ben\n\nMORE: Home and Away spoilers: Robbo attacks Dr Alex in terrifying scenes\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Despite Irene, Leah and Colby's support, Bella is taken aback when faced with her worst nightmare in court.", "authors": ["Imogen Groome"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot-2019-10-07-at-00.27.55-2bc2_1570449305.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
