It\u2019s a game, with news organizations competing to see which one can get the story that brings down the president, and other media and 2020 candidates piling on in knee-jerk fashion. It\u2019s a rinse-and-repeat exercise.\n\nIndeed, the so-called whistleblower complaint recalls the early days of Trump\u2019s presidency when Comey and other Barack Obama holdovers were poisoning the well. Even the word \u201cwhistleblower\u201d suggests something untoward happened.\n\nBut what? The media was in the dark but still the coverage took on tones of hysteria. They didn\u2019t know the source of the complaint, the agency, the substance or any evidence.\n\nNo matter. Their anonymous sources told them Trump did something bad, and most media believe it because they desperately want it to be true. Not incidentally, these sources almost certainly included Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who repeatedly promised there was evidence of Russia collusion.", "description": "", "authors": ["Michael Goodwin", "Nypost.Com Goodwin-Comey-And-Baquet-United-Against-Trump-Have-Caused-A-Nonstop-Feeding-Frenzy"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
