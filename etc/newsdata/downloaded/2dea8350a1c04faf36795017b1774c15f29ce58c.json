In such a scenario, and without being granted further time beyond the October 31 deadline, there would be a no-deal Brexit \u2013 meaning trade would immediately be done with higher tariffs imposed by both sides.\n\nWhen asked about the probability of a no-deal Brexit, Antti Rinne told CNBC: \"I will say that now it seems that it's going to happen, and we need to accept that it's going to happen, but I hope that we can reach a situation where we can together, with British and EU27, to create a better world\u2026\"\n\nThe U.K. is the first member state to ask to leave the European Union \u2013 a political and economic group, which started more than six decades ago.
