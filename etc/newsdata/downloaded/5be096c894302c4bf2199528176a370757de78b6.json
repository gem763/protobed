Lam explained that the government believes the regulation will be an \"effective deterrent\" against violent behavior and help police officers carry out their duties.\n\nUnder the 1922 Emergency Regulations Ordinance, the chief executive is allowed to \"make any regulations whatsoever which he may consider desirable in the public interest.\" It also states that any regulations drafted under this ordinance remain in place until repealed by the chief executive.\n\nHong Kong has been swallowed by mass demonstrations since early June. Protest initially began over a now-withdrawn bill that would have enabled extradition to mainland China.\n\nLam's comments come after tensions hit a new high on Tuesday, China's National Day, after an 18-year-old anti-government protester was shot by police, the first person hit by live gunfire in nearly four months of unrest. The protester has been charged with rioting and attacking a police officer.\n\nLocal authorities have repeatedly said that the officer fired his weapon in self-defense. Multiple videos of the shooting show protesters carrying objects like wrenches and hammers.\n\nOf the roughly 1,100 people injured in the protests, Lam said that at least 300 of them were police officers.\n\n\"There's a use of lethal weapons, corrosive liquids, snatching of suspects and snatching of police pistols. So, the police have no choice but to use their guns to save their own lives,\" Lam said.\n\nAccording to Reuters, police in the Chinese territory were given greater power to use force during protests, ahead of China's 70th National Day on Tuesday. Reuters reported that officers fired approximately 1,400 rounds of tear gas and nearly 900 rubber bullets.\n\nThe city is a former British colony and returned to Chinese rule in 1997. As a special administrative region of China, Hong Kong operates under a \"one country, two systems\" structure which grants its citizens legal and economic freedoms that citizens in mainland China do not have.\n\nThis is breaking news.
