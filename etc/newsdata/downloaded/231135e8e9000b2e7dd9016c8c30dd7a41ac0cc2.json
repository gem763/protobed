Giuliani in the U.S.-Ukraine relationship to alleged efforts by American diplomats sent to Kiev and attorneys in the Office of the White House Counsel to contain or suppress the accruing damage.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Aug. 12, he delivered his document \u2014 a nine-page version of which was made public on Thursday \u2014 to the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, triggering an almost immediate clash between the executive branch and Congress.\n\nRead the unclassified whistleblower complaint\n\nSix weeks later, the whistleblower has by some measures managed to exceed what former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III accomplished in two years of investigating Trump: producing a file so concerning and factually sound that it has almost single-handedly set in motion the gears of impeachment.\n\n\u201cIn the course of my official duties,\u201d the whistleblower writes in the first sentence of his complaint, he learned that \u201cthe President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe file goes on to bolster that contention with specific language that matches the since-released White House summary of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president and points to other potential witnesses and grave allegations.\n\nAD\n\nPerhaps the most explosive is the document\u2019s assertion that White House officials used a classified computer system to hide documents that might be politically damaging to the president.\n\nAmong them, the complaint says, was the rough transcript of the call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump urged his foreign counterpart to mount investigations that would potentially deliver damaging information about Biden and his family.\n\nAD\n\nThe detailed notes of that call released this week show that the whistleblower\u2019s depictions \u2014 having neither heard the conversation nor seen the transcript \u2014 were eerily accurate. The contents of the call alone were widely regarded as politically damaging to the president.\n\nThe full, rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s president, annotated\n\nThe whistleblower report raises troubling new allegations about the call, saying that White House officials quickly moved it from a widely shared internal computer network to one reserved for \u201ccodeword-level\u201d records about CIA covert-action programs or other highly classified material.\n\nAD\n\nIf true, that could implicate those who directed the relocation of the files and serve as evidence of their motivation: concealing presidential conduct they understood to be problematic and potentially illegal.\n\nAD\n\nA paragraph in the appendix asserts this was not an isolated incident.\n\n\u201cAccording to multiple White House officials I spoke with,\u201d the document says, White House lawyers had on other occasions used the \u201ccodeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive \u2014 rather than national security sensitive \u2014 information.\u201d\n\nTrump, speaking at the United Nations in New York on Thursday, disparaged the author of the report, saying that he was \u201calmost a spy\u201d and potentially guilty of \u201ctreason.\u201d\n\nAttacking his accusers is one of Trump\u2019s standard tactics when thrown on the defensive. He repeatedly accused Mueller and other investigators on the Russia inquiry of being dishonest, beholden to Democrats and engaged in a politically motivated \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSignificant differences between the Russia investigation and the whistleblower complaint, however, may make it more difficult for Trump to rely on such tactics. Among them are the accuser\u2019s anonymity, the existence of a transcript that many regard as formidable proof of the underlying allegation and the speed with which the complaint has already transformed the political landscape in Washington.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be remembered as a truth-seeker,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. If and when his identity is revealed, \u201cit\u2019ll be one of those names in the history books and around forever, like Daniel Ellsberg,\u201d who was responsible for the release of the Pentagon Papers.\n\nTrump has all but called for the whistleblower and those who assisted him to be unmasked, despite federal laws designed to protect identities and prevent reprisals in such cases.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person who gave the whistleblower . . . the information,\u201d the president said Thursday.\n\nOther officials have said they are intentionally not seeking information about his identity. Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, testified Thursday that he does not know who wrote the document. A Justice Department file related to the case noted that the inspector general found \u201csome indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the complainant,\u201d but Maguire said he did not question the whistleblower\u2019s motivations.\n\n\u201cI think the whistleblower did the right thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he followed the law every step of the way.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAlthough his name has not been disclosed, aspects of his background have emerged. He works for the CIA, an affiliation first reported by the New York Times on Thursday, according to current and former officials familiar with his identity and position in the intelligence community.\n\nAD\n\nU.S. officials and an attorney for the whistleblower have asked news organizations to refrain from releasing details about him, citing concerns for his privacy and safety.\n\nIn the complaint, the whistleblower describes receiving troubling reports about the Trump administration\u2019s approach with Ukraine from \u201cmore than half a dozen U.S. officials\u201d over four months.\n\nBut the document suggests that it was only after learning about the nature of Trump\u2019s call July 25 with Zelensky that the whistleblower went from sharing colleagues\u2019 concerns to being convinced that he needed to document and report them.\n\nAD\n\nAn approximate transcript released by the White House shows Trump prodding Zelensky to direct his government\u2019s investigative bodies to turn their attention to alleged corruption by an energy company for which Hunter Biden, the former vice president\u2019s son, had served as a board member.\n\nAD\n\nTrump has alleged that the elder Biden used his influence to shut down a corruption investigation targeting the company. The claim has been repeatedly discredited, and there is no credible public allegation that Hunter Biden was guilty of wrongdoing.\n\nTrump also urged Zelensky to \u201cmeet or speak with\u201d Giuliani and Attorney General William P. Barr to redouble Ukraine\u2019s efforts to seek damaging material tied to Biden.\n\n\u201cMultiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call informed me that, after an initial exchange of pleasantries, the president used the remainder of the call to advance his personal interests,\u201d the whistleblower report says.\n\nThe document also cites other developments that allegedly troubled White House officials, including the abrupt removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine in May after a campaign by right-wing media entities to discredit her.\n\nAD\n\nAlthough the report does not describe explicit coordination between the whistleblower and White House officials, it depicts an arrangement in which he so routinely received communications of concern from White House officials that it raises the question of whether they knew he intended to file a whistleblower complaint.\n\nThe report refers to a \u201cdiscussion ongoing\u201d between those troubled by the call and White House lawyers, indicating administration attorneys were aware of internal concerns about Trump\u2019s conduct before the whistleblower complaint surfaced.\n\nThe report lays out investigative leads for Congress or other authorities. It notes that there were \u201capproximately a dozen White House officials who listened to the call\u201d and identifies a State Department official \u2014 referred to with conspicuous formality as \u201cMr. T. Ulrich Brechbuhl\u201d \u2014 as another participant.\n\nBrechbuhl had joined the State Department only in May, as an adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nBeyond his sourcing at the White House, the whistleblower has remarkable insight into the activities of U.S. diplomats and Ukrainian officials. The report notes that Kurt Volker, the U.S. special representative for Ukraine, and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, arrived in Kiev the day after Trump\u2019s call and proceeded to advise officials there on how to \u201cnavigate\u201d the demands of the American president.\n\nThe document also traces Giuliani\u2019s extensive intervention in U.S.-Ukraine affairs, including a meeting in Madrid with one of Zelensky\u2019s senior advisers. The Madrid trip was described as a \u201cdirect follow-up\u201d to the Trump-Zelensky call, for a fuller discussion of the \u201ccases\u201d mentioned in the two leaders\u2019 discussion.\n\nAt its core, the complaint makes the case that Trump was withholding items that Ukraine desperately wanted \u2014 including hundreds of millions of dollars in aid and an invitation to the White House \u2014 to use as leverage.\n\nThe Trump administration had been sending those signals since Zelensky\u2019s inauguration on May 20. American officials who traveled to Kiev to attend the ceremony \u201cmade clear\u201d to the Ukrainians that Trump would not meet the new leader until he saw how Zelensky \u201cchose to act,\u201d according to the document. Any meeting or phone call would hinge on the Ukrainian president\u2019s willingness to \u201cplay ball\u201d with his American counterpart, the whistleblower wrote.\n\nGreg Jaffe, Ellen Nakashima, Karen DeYoung, Shane Harris and Julie Tate contributed to this report.", "description": "Trump said the whistleblower is \u201calmost a spy.\u201d Others said, \u201cHe\u2019ll be remembered as a truth-seeker.\u201d", "authors": ["Greg Miller", "National Security", "Intelligence"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bJ7epYtvbu1wWk1WklRFg0eOjLE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/D7MB6NHATUI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
