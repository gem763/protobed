The gymnast took home her first big check when she was around 12 years old, she recalls on a recent episode of \"Kneading Dough\" with Maverick Carter.\n\nBut the accomplished 22-year-old doesn't take her success, or the money she's earned from it, for granted. Biles, who was named the most dominant athlete of 2018, nonetheless says, \"I have a fear of going broke.\"\n\nIt keeps her frugal. She even challenges herself to go days without spending any money, she tells Carter: \"And then, of course, my gas light come on so I have to go get gas.\" But besides the necessities, as well as the occasional trip to Subway, she says, \"I never really swipe the [credit] card.\"\n\nThough she has endorsement deals with major companies like Nike, Kellogg's and Hershey's, she says that there is one time when she'll spend big: \"I will only splurge if I earned it.\" And she's certainly had plenty of moments to celebrate: She has five Olympic medals and recently became the first U.S. gymnast to medal at every event at a world championship.\n\nBiles already has a reward in mind for her next major accomplishment: \"A G-wagon. Matte black.
