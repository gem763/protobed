Jakes' \"spiritual daughter.\"\n\n\u201cEarly in Paula's life, she didn't know God, but there was always a pull to something greater. Once she prayed for salvation at the age of 18, Paula finally understood the meaning of grace and purpose, and realized God had been taking care of her the whole time.\u201d\n\nSeveral prominent evangelical leaders took to social media to endorse White\u2019s book.\n\nIn a since-deleted tweet, Franklin Graham, president of Samaritan\u2019s Purse and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, encouraged his 2 million followers to \u201ccheck out\u201d Something Greater, noting that White has lived an \u201cinteresting life.\u201d The move drew the ire of some public commenters who said Grahams\u2019 late father, Billy Graham, would be \u201cdisappointed\u201d in his son's endorsement.\n\nAdditionally, Jack Graham, pastor of Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano, Texas, tweeted: \u201cMy good friend @Paula_White has written a new book which releases tomorrow. It is powerful. I highly recommend it!\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, Robert Jeffress, pastor of First Baptist Dallas, said to give Something Greater to \u201canyone looking for hope!\u201d While Jerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University, added, \u201cPaula\u2019s life is an encouragement to so many and I\u2019m sure this book will encourage you.\u201d\n\nResponding Jeffress, author and evangelist Justin Peters said, \"@robertjeffress I appeal to you to immediately disassociate with Paula White. A lack of discernment of this magnitude is a very, very serious issue for a pastor. She is both unqualified and disqualified on every imaginable level to be in any kind of ministry. This is serious.\"\n\nGreg Laurie, pastor of Harvest Christian Fellowship in Riverside, California, said while he and White have different theological views, her book will give readers \u201chope.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly, I was not sure what to think when I was first invited to meet @Paula_White,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cClearly, we differed in some areas theologically. Yet, I have found her to be gracious and humble. I\u2019m glad she has taken the time to write down her amazing life story. It will give you hope.\"\n\nRalph Reed of the Faith and Freedom Coalition also expressed his support, tweeting: \"@Paula_White 's book #SomethingGreater launches today. An amazing read. Honest & inspiring. I\u2019ve read it and I highly recommend this terrific book!\"\n\nWhite, who in the past has described herself as the \u201cconvener and de facto head\u201d of the president\u2019s evangelical advisery board, has been criticized in the past for her teachings, particularly surrounding the prosperity gospel, or the idea that God desires His followers to acquire financial riches, experience vibrant health and live comfortable lives.\n\nIn 2017, Russell Moore, head of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, blasted White as \u201ca charlatan . . . recognized as a heretic by every orthodox Christian, of whatever tribe.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Michael Horton of Westminster Seminary accused White of teaching that everyone can be a \u201clittle god,\u201d and claiming that God came not to bring forgiveness of sins, but to \u201cgive us the power to claim prosperity.\u201d\n\nWhite, however, has said she rejects the prosperity gospel. \u201cI do not believe in the \u2018prosperity gospel\u2019 as I\u2019ve been accused of believing it,\u201d White told The Christian Post. \u201cI do believe that all good things come from God, and I also believe that God teaches us so much through our suffering.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen to 100 of my sermons, and 80 or 90 of them will be about overcoming our struggles and the lessons God teaches us in valleys He allows us to enter. My life has not been an easy one, from my childhood, and at times, in my adulthood,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI'm 50 now, and a grandmother, so there are, of course, things my 50-year-old self wouldn't have done at 25. Thankfully, God gives us so much grace and allows us to learn so much through our trials. He's also allowed me to bring millions of people along through my personal experiences, trials and, sometimes, pain.\n\n\"I have been accused of so many things that are untrue,\" White added. \"Some of those accusations persist despite their being entirely false, but I'll just continue preaching the Gospel.\u201d", "description": "Several prominent Christian leaders have come under fire for promoting the newest book of Paula White, a prosperity gospel preacher who has in the past been accused of teaching heretical doctrines.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/original/thumbnail/23/34/233463.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
