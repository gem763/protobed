For one game. My hard drive currently has less than half that space free for all games. And Modern Warfare is far from alone in its Galactus-like hunger for hard drive space.\n\nThe PC version of Red Dead Redemption 2, for example, will not stop until it has callously conquered 150 GB of your PC\u2019s storage.\n\nThis continues an upward trend seen in other recent heavyweight kingpins like the PC versions of Gears of War 4, Gears 5, Halo 5 and Final Fantasy XV, all of which clock in at over 100 GB when you add high-res texture packs (the latter even without improved textures). PC gaming has always been characterised by a little extra pain in the name of optimal pleasure, but this is reaching preposterously bonkers proportions.\n\nActivision, at least, has an explanation for why its game plans on spreading out its legs and taking up three whole seats of hard drive space.\n\n\u201c175 GB is the storage space we recommend players keep available in order to download the post-launch content we\u2019ll be bringing to Modern Warfare,\u201d the publisher said in a blog post. \u201cAt launch, the initial download will be smaller.\u201d\n\nSo far, however, Rockstar has not said anything along those lines, meaning that Red Dead Redemption 2 will likely cause hard drives the world over to squeal like hogtied pigs on which somebody tried to install a large video game.\n\nThat\u2019s a pain! I don\u2019t just use my hard drive for games, but also other things like videos and images I download and then forget to delete. I should have the freedom to be at least a little big negligent and irresponsible, darn it!\n\nAs is, however, I expect that it will not be long until I have to delete myself in order to make room for the PC version of the latest, greatest big-budget hit. I fear that day. I am not ready for the cold blackness of the recycle bin.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason for this endless ballooning: As outlined by PC Gamer in a 2018 investigation, textures keep getting more complex and, therefore, bigger, and there\u2019s not a practical way to compress them sans loss of fidelity in the same way there is for, say, audio.\n\nUnlike on consoles, PC games aren\u2019t as constrained by disc space, either, so developers can go a little wilder with how much space games take up.\n\nSo yeah, Modern Warfare and Red Dead Redemption 2 will probably look best on PC, but you might want to do some spring cleaning before you buy them. Or you can just be like me, continue treating your hard drive like your messy bedroom, and resign yourself to only installing one game at a time.
