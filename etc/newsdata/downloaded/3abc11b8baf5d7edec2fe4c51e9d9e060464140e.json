Supplied\n\nDarling Harbour vibes\n\nCloser to home, TFE has confirmed it would officially open its newest Sydney hotel in Darling Harbour on October 17 as it cements Vibe as a lifestyle brand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 16-storey, 145-room new-build hotel is the fourth Sydney Vibe for the group and is owned by Sydney developer Icon Oceania, which is currently considering a sale of the property with the Vibe brand.\n\nThe Manhattan-meets-Sydney property will lead the way in a series of other Australian openings including Hobart, Melbourne and Adelaide.\n\nWith no signs of a slowdown in international travel, the demand for hotel rooms will remain steady, Mr Ritch says.\n\n\"But in saying that, the markets are changing. It\u2019s no longer good enough to look at Sydney CBD as one big market, instead we must look at it as a series of micromarkets \u2013 each dynamic and unique,\" he said.\n\n\"When we open hotels, we deep-dive into these micromarkets to ensure our teams understand the location specific experience for our guests, and deliver a hotel that enables this.\"", "description": "The European hotels are two of the 26 new properties TFE Hotels is set to open in the next three years, with a new Sydney Vibe hotel also set to open.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3021%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_141/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/71f3ab455f8131007a3fb0c0bd0f5676004cf8d1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
