Euro/sterling was also flat at 86.32 pence.\n\nTraders worry that initial relief at securing the long-awaited Brexit deal could be brief, however, because the prime minister still needs to sell the agreement to sceptical lawmakers when parliament sits on Saturday.\n\nBNP Paribas analysts expect the pound to rise to $1.33 if a deal is agreed on Saturday. But sterling may pare its recent gains if a deal is rejected, \"although the market may be quick to fade any sterling pullback, with bullish sentiment remaining entrenched,\" BNP Paribas analysts said.\n\nThe yuan held steady against the dollar after data showed China's economy grew at the weakest pace in more than 27 years in the third quarter due to a costly trade war with the United States and weak factory production.\n\nIn the offshore market, the yuan was last neutral at 7.0865 against the dollar.\n\nElsewhere, the Norwegian krone broke another all-time low of 10.2335 against the euro and was last trading down 0.1% at 10.2285.\n\nAnalysts were scratching their heads why the krone was so weak, saying one possible explanation could be the weak demand for Norwegian equities.\n\n\"Historically the NOK has often traded weak towards the end of the year, but our FX analysts are struggling to find the flows that explain this seasonal weakness,\" said SEB analysts in a note to clients.\n\n(Reporting by Olga Cotaga Editing by Peter Graff, William Maclean)", "description": "The euro was hovering on Friday around the seven-week high it reached against the U.S. dollar on Thursday, amid hopes that a Brexit deal between Britain and the European Union could prevent an economic recession in the euro zone.  \"Without Brexit, the euro might be now liberated from this burden", "authors": ["Olga Cotaga"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
