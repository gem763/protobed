People didn't know what basketball was or what the NBA was.\"\n\nToronto Star basketball writer Doug Smith, left, is shown shaking hands with the Raptors' DeMar DeRozan in this 2016 file photo. Smith has covered the team since its inception into the NBA. (Rick Madonik/Toronto Star)\n\nSmith said there was a diehard fanbase of about 10,000 people or so who were crazy for their Raptors in the beginning. But outside of that, the team didn't own much real estate in the minds of Torontonians or Canadians.\n\n\"Players didn't want to come here. Players didn't want to wear that goofy dinosaur,\" Smith recalls. \"We didn't know if it would work. But people believed.\"\n\nWe the North will cover the team's lows and highs, including Vince Carter's iconic dunk contest performance, the departure of stars like Carter and DeMar DeRozan and the Raptors taking down the Warriors dynasty for their first championship.\n\nToronto's NBA franchise unveils the team name and colours. 2:54\n\n\"The idea of telling the story not just of the Raptors, but of the way the country changed around them, has been rattling around in my head for a few years,\" said Smith in a press release.\n\n\"The 25th anniversary season, and last season's NBA championship run, seems like the best possible moment to do it.\"\n\nThe Raptors are heading into the 2019-2020 season as the reigning NBA champions.\n\nThey'll receive their rings at the home opener against the New Orleans Pelicans on Oct. 22, 2019.", "description": "We the North: 25 Years of the Toronto Raptors will share the highlights and tough periods of the 2019 championship team's history.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5313327.1570550723!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/bkn-raptors-van-vleet-20190724.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
