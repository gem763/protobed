Think of it like the buttons you\u2019ve likely seen that let you sign into apps and websites using your Facebook or Google account. Now, Project Verify has an official name \u2014 ZenKey \u2014 and it\u2019s starting to roll out, albeit very slowly.\n\nZenKey\u2019s pitch is that you should be able to use your phone, the device that\u2019s already on you all the time, as a way to verify your identity, and in a way that goes beyond the now-standard SMS authentication that has in the past few years become especially vulnerable to hacks. When it was Project Verify, the carriers said that they verified your identity using not just your phone number, but also your carrier account tenure, phone account type, and SIM card. With the launch of the new ZenKey brand, the four carrier partners also shared a little more about how ZenKey is supposed to work.\n\nIt won\u2019t be quite as easy as just tapping a login button when using your phone. You\u2019re going to have to set up the ZenKey app that\u2019s offered by your specific carrier and add a PIN or biometric authentication so that you can prove your identity whenever you use the app.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve set the app up, the promise is that all future logins should be easier. Wherever you see a green \u201cSign in with ZenKey\u201d button on a login screen, you can tap it to log into that service without any fuss, presumably. It would seem to work a bit like Apple\u2019s new \u201cSign in with Apple\u201d initiative that promises better security and more privacy protections around account credentialing.\n\nThat said, we\u2019re all going to have to wait a bit if we want to try ZenKey. The carriers say it\u2019s still in beta and that apps will be available \u201csoon\u201d for Android and iOS. The Verge has asked for more clarification on when those might roll out.\n\nWe did find Verizon\u2019s ZenKey app on the Google Play store, but it\u2019s tagged as early access and doesn\u2019t do much yet. My colleague Sean Hollister tested the app, but after agreeing to the initial terms and conditions, he said he got stuck on a screen with the ZenKey logo.\n\nImportantly, we don\u2019t have any idea of what apps or services will support ZenKey. If the apps you use regularly don\u2019t support it, there\u2019s not going to be much incentive for you to use it. We\u2019ve also asked ZenKey for any details on app support.\n\nHowever, one reason to consider using ZenKey is that it seems you\u2019ll be able to toggle what personal data is sent to each service you log into. It\u2019s hard to know exactly what data is being collected when you use Google\u2019s or Facebook\u2019s buttons, either by those tech giants or the services that have partnered with them, so being able to have some control over what\u2019s shared could be a reason to use ZenKey instead. That is if you\u2019re offered a choice.", "description": "Last September, AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon announced Project Verify, a way to log into apps without making a new account or password by instead relying on your smartphone to authenticate your identity.
