He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Live Theatre.\n\nHe also donated a large part of his time to AIDS causes, and various other charities.\n\nIn a 2016 interview with Anderson Valley Advertiser, Taylor said he would like to be remembered as \"Someone who is funny and kept people happy.\"\n\nTaylor is survived by longtime partner, Robert Fortney.\n\nAfter news broke of the loss, fellow comedians took to Twitter to share their memories of the legend.\n\nBilly Eichner wrote, \"RIP, Rip. I can\u2019t imagine how much bulls---- you had to deal with in an industry that decided it was finally cool to be a gay man in comedy, like, a year ago.
