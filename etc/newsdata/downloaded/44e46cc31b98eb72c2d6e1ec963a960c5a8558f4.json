Giuliani\u2019s on-air appearances threw the department into a tizzy, forcing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to try to put a lid on the crisis of confidence bubbling up under him, according to three senior U.S. officials. For Pompeo, solving the problem meant finding someone to blame\u2014and there was only one individual who fit the mold, according to those same sources: former U.S. representative for Ukraine negotiations Kurt Volker\u2026\n\nPompeo\u2019s plan appears to have backfired. Despite the secretary\u2019s efforts to block several of his current and former officials from speaking to Congress, Volker is set to go to Capitol Hill on Thursday with the backing of a cadre of current and former diplomats. Some of those diplomats spoke to The Daily Beast and requested anonymity because they feared reprisals from Pompeo and other Trump administration officials.", "description": "", "authors": ["Erin Banco", "Thedailybeast.Com Mike-Pompeo-Pushed-Out-His-Own-Ukraine-Representative-Kurt-Volker-To-Quiet-A-Growing-Scandal"], "top_image": ""}
