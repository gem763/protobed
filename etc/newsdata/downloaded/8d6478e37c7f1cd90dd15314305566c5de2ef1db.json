His 49-0 record speaks for itself. If I hurt Marciano\u2019s family, I regret it.\u201d\n\nIt was a tough spot for Holmes, and illustrates the difficulty in determining Marciano\u2019s legacy.\n\nMarciano was an undersized heavyweight, 189 pounds at 5-foot-11. He won the heavyweight title by knocking out 38-year-old Jersey Joe Walcott in Philadelphia in 1952, a fight that Walcott was winning until Marciano knocked him out in the 13th round. He knocked Walcott out in the first round in their rematch a year later.\n\nHe successfully defended the belt four more times, with two of those wins over former heavyweight champion Ezzard Charles and then knocked out Archie Moore, who was 38 at the time, in the ninth round.\n\nShortly after, at the age of 32, Marciano announced his retirement.\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly an impressive record of title defenses, primarily against well-known fighters past their prime. Ironically, you could make the same case about Holmes and the lackluster opponents he defended his title against.\n\nBut as heavyweight champion, all you can do is defend against the opponents in your era. The quality of Holmes\u2019 opponents should not diminish his legacy as one of the great heavyweight champions. Neither should Marciano\u2019s title defenses.\n\nI\u2019ve spoken to a number of boxing trainers over the years about Marciano\u2019s legacy, including many African-American trainers. There is, for the most part, universal respect for his heart and toughness \u2014 his willingness to survive a beating and come out victorious.\n\nMarciano fought once in Washington \u2014 Sept. 30, 1948, at the Uline Arena \u2014 his ninth professional fight. He knocked out Gil Cardione in the first round before a crowd of 1,272. That card also featured beloved District middleweight Holly Mims, who made his professional debut with a four-round victory over Julian Keene.\n\nMarciano had one more fight after his death \u2014 the \u201cSuperfight,\u201d a computer-generated bout between Marciano and Ali during Ali\u2019s ban from boxing where both fighters stepped into the ring and spared for 75 one-minute rounds, with a formula fed into a computer of the results used to determine probabilities and outcome.\n\nThe filming was completed three weeks before Marciano died, and the film was released in select theatres in January 1970, five months after the plane crash. Marciano was the winner in the American version of the film, while Ali won in the European release.\n\nIt may have been a farce of an event, but the \u201cSuperfight\u201d had more credibility than Floyd Mayweather supposedly surpassing Marciano\u2019s 49-0 record with the fraudulent bout between Mayweather and mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor, where Mayweather\u2019s 10th round stoppage of a glorified sparring session gave him a 50-0 record career mark.\n\nLong after that fateful Iowa plane crash 50 years ago, Rocky Marciano still has a complicated boxing legacy.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday and Sunday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
