No financial terms were disclosed.\n\nFounded in 2017, the artificial intelligence upstart is backed by some of tech\u2019s venture capital heavyweights, including LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman\u2019s Greylock Partners. McDonald\u2019s will look to preserve Apprente\u2019s culture and encourage the development of new technologies. The company\u2019s group of scientists will be founding members of the Silicon Valley-based McD Tech Labs.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s says it will continue to build out McD Tech Labs\u2019 engineer and data scientist ranks.\n\n\u201cBuilding our technology infrastructure and digital capabilities are fundamental to our Velocity Growth Plan and enable us to meet rising expectations from our customers, while making it simpler and even more enjoyable for crew members to serve guests,\" said McDonald\u2019s President and CEO Steve Easterbook in a statement.\n\n\u201cMcDonald\u2019s commitment to innovation has long inspired our team. It was quite clear from our various engagements that McDonald\u2019s is leading the industry with technology\u201d said Itamar Arel, Ph.D., co-founder of Apprente and now vice president of McD Tech Labs. \u201cApprente was borne out of an opportunity to use technology to solve challenging real world problems and we\u2019re thrilled to now apply this to creating personalized experiences for customers and crew.\u201d\n\nMcDonald\u2019s declined to make an executive available for an interview beyond the statements in the press release.\n\n(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) More\n\nThe Golden Arches said it has tested Apprente\u2019s technology at select restaurants. How it works is as follows: you drive up to the menu board, speak to a voice-powered machine (just like ordering stuff from Amazon\u2019s Alexa) to place an order, and drive up to the window to pick up the order.\n\nGone are the days of having to repeat your order five times into the drive-thru, which ultimately slows down the drive-thru lane. So, that\u2019s a positive from a customer service and productivity standpoint.\n\nThe risks of using machines\n\nBut what could snag McDonald\u2019s some negative headlines on this one is the potential removal of an extra crew member at the drive-thru window. After all, you will be speaking directly to a machine not a human.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how that dynamic will evolve over time, but with worker wages on the rise in fast food, all chains are exploring ways to reduce labor hours by using tech.\n\nTo be sure, McDonald\u2019s is getting serious about harnessing tech to rethink its operations. McDonald\u2019s announced in late March it acquired Dynamic Yield, its largest acquisition in 20 years. The technology creates suggested items for the drive-thru menu board based on time of day, weather, current restaurant traffic and trending orders.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s said Tuesday the technology has quickly ramped up to 8,000 U.S. restaurants. It plans to have it available in all of its 14,000-plus U.S. restaurants and roughly 1,000 Australia stores by the end of this year.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-host of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
