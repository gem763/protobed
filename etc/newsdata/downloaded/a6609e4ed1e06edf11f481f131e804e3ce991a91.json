While it cannot enforce recommendations, adherence to its guidelines is important for financial inclusion in major economies and markets.\n\nIn late June, the FATF issued new guidelines on how digital assets should be regulated. The guidelines would impose the same standards on the cryptocurrency sector that are normally shouldered by the banking industry.\n\nIn what has now become known as the travel rule, the FATF guidelines require regulators and Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to collect and share personal data regarding transactions. For businesses that fail to comply, this could mean being shut out of lucrative international markets.\n\nOne of Shyft\u2019s goals is to implement an industry-wide solution to the FATF travel rule presented to VASPs by using Shyft\u2019s identity passporting, database bridging and data attestation infrastructure. With their experience in the FATF and other major regulatory organizations, Shyft expects Nadeau and McDonell to provide valuable advice in regard to this goal.\n\nOne-year deadline to comply\n\nThe FATF has given local authorities and VASPs exactly one year to form a regulatory framework that complies with the travel rule.\n\nJohn Roth, the chief compliance and ethics officer at cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex, told Cointelegraph that, although the FATF has given a one-year deadline to VASPs, a suitable solution may take longer due to the industry\u2019s diversity and the potential expense of a new method of collecting necessary information, adding:", "description": "Former members of the Financial Action Task Force have joined the board of advisors of a blockchain firm that wants to implement solutions to the FATF travel ru...", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9kNzYxZjRhM2VmOGQ1NThjMDdkNzY1N2M1YjUwMDZmMy5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
