This passes the 50 per cent threshold required to satisfy the acceptance condition. CDL parties already owned 65.2 per cent of M&C shares as at June 7.\n\nCDL revived its takeover bid on June 7 with a higher cash offer of 685 pence (S$11.62) per share, for the remaining 34.8 per cent stake in M&C, valuing the hotel chain at \u00a32.23 billion (S$3.78 billion).

After the delisting, it will be re-registered as a private company.\n\nM&C shareholders who do not accept the offer may become a minority shareholder in an unlisted private subsidiary of CDL with no certainty of any future opportunity to sell their shares, M&C said.\n\nThe outgoing independent committee of M&C thus recommended that shareholders accept the offer immediately.\n\nOn Thursday, CDL advised its shareholders to refrain from taking any action in respect of their securities in the company which may be prejudicial to their interests, and to exercise caution when dealing in such shares or securities.\n\nCDL shares closed at S$9.80, down 10 Singapore cents or 1.01 per cent, on Thursday before the announcements were made.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Companies & Markets - CITY Developments Limited (CDL) said its final cash offer to acquire all the remaining shares in its London-listed subsidiary Millennium & Copthorne Hotels (M&C) has been declared unconditional in all respects. .
