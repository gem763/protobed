Bloomberg\u2019s State Impact Center was to promote a climate change agenda by providing state attorneys general with privately paid legal staff, and it seems to be working in New Mexico.\n\nOne of the state\u2019s legal fellows, Robert Lundin, kept plenty busy in his first year, providing the \u201cofficial legislative analysis\u201d for the state\u2019s \u201cmini-Green New Deal\u201d legislation, which passed in March, and working on the legal strategy to shut down a coal-fired electricity plant near Farmington.\n\n\u201cMr. Lundin was involved in the on-going process to shut down San Juan Generating Station \u2014 a large, coal-fired power plant in New Mexico,\u201d said the Nov. 5 periodic report on his performance for the State Energy & Environmental Impact Center at New York University School of Law.\n\n\u201cHe and lead counsel discussed legal strategy with many stakeholders to determine a course of action in regards to initiating a proceeding to retire the plant,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe [Public Regulation] Commission then, following the strategy \u2026 ordered the public utility to abandon the coal plant.\u201d\n\nThe report, obtained through an open records request by Power the Future, offers the first public glimpse at the work being done by the Bloomberg legal fellows, or special assistant attorneys general, since the hotly debated program was announced in 2017.\n\nLarry Behrens, Western States director of Power the Future, an all-of-the-above energy advocacy group, said the four-page document from the New Mexico attorney general\u2019s office shows that the embedded climate advocates are influencing state decision-making.\n\nHe said Mr. Lundin was tasked with undertaking the \u201cofficial analysis\u201d of legislation to increase the state\u2019s renewable-portfolio standard to 100% carbon-free electricity generation by 2045, \u201cwhich would lead the nation,\u201d the report said.\n\nNew Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, signed the Energy Transition Act, also known as the \u201cmini-Green New Deal,\u201d in March.\n\n\u201cHere you have someone who is paid by Michael Bloomberg and who is putting forward an official opinion from the New Mexico attorney general\u2019s office about policy in New Mexico,\u201d Mr. Behrens said.\n\nMatt Baca, spokesman for New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas, said the special assistant attorneys general answer to the state, not the Bloomberg-funded center in New York City.\n\n\u201cNew Mexico Attorney General employees are not supervised, directed, or controlled by NYU or the State Impact Center,\u201d Mr. Baca wrote in an email. \u201cThe Attorney General\u2019s office only represents the people of New Mexico, from maximizing trust royalties from oil and gas revenue for school children to ensuring that indigenous communities are protected from further environmental pollution.\u201d\n\nAt least seven states, all led by Democratic attorneys general, have been chosen to receive the privately funded legal fellows \u201cdedicated to working on clean energy, climate change and environmental matters of national and regional importance,\u201d according to the center.\n\nNot all states are comfortable with the specter of staffing the state prosecutor\u2019s office with privately funded climate lawyers. In April, the majority Republicans in the Virginia legislature banned the state from participating in the program.\n\nNew Mexico has brought on two special assistant attorneys general for two-year terms, according to emails from the attorney general\u2019s office, but not without controversy.\n\nThe Albuquerque Journal said the \u201ctop prosecutorial office in the state needs to be above reproach, and Balderas has to recognize this arrangement is not.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile it added two attorneys to his staff, it did so at the expense of his office\u2019s independence and impartiality \u2014 even if it\u2019s in appearance only,\u201d said the July 19 editorial. \u201cIt\u2019s essential Balderas takes a step back and remembers who elected him and whom he works for.\u201d\n\nAn August 2018 report by Chris Horner, then a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said the \u201cunprecedented arrangement operates in a gray area with neither prohibition nor authority.\u201d\n\nIn its hiring agreement, the center requires states to submit four periodic reports during the special assistant attorneys general\u2019s two-year term about \u201cthe contribution that the legal fellow has made to clean energy, climate change, and environmental initiatives.\u201d\n\nSuch reports are subject to open records requests. In New Mexico\u2019s case, that requirement has since been dropped, according to a March 8 email from State Impact Center Deputy Director Elizabeth Klein.\n\n\u201cThis email confirms that there\u2019s no need to provide the periodic update referenced in the second agreement,\u201d Ms. Klein told state officials.\n\nThe agreement also stipulated that the legal fellows must avoid activities that would \u201ccarry on propaganda\u201d or involve lobbying.\n\nThe periodic report for Mr. Lundin showed that he also worked on an electricity sales and revenue \u201cdecoupling\u201d bill aimed at clearing the way for utilities to pursue renewable energy, and was involved in the office\u2019s decision not to intervene in a challenge to a 500-megawatt wind energy project.\n\n\u201cThe NMAG relied on Mr. Lundin\u2019s analysis to abstain from intervening in the case,\u201d the report said.\n\nIt was unclear which project was referenced, given that locals and environmentalists have raised objections in recent years to several wind farm initiatives and the resulting transmission lines as New Mexico seeks to become a wind energy leader.\n\nDairy farmers in Bosque, New Mexico, launched in June a petition to stop Pattern Development from constructing a massive 800-megawatt \u201cWestern Spirit\u201d transmission line aimed at transporting wind power to the grid, calling it an \u201ceyesore\u201d and a \u201chealth scare,\u201d KQED-TV reported.\n\nMr. Behrens called the Bloomberg climate program \u201cdetrimental to our state,\u201d given that New Mexico\u2019s recent oil and gas boom has brought unprecedented riches to the traditionally poor state, allowing the governor to offer free public college tuition to residents.\n\n\u201cOur energy workers are providing not only energy to New Mexico, but to the rest of the country, helping us to become energy independent and providing billions of dollars to our state economy,\u201d Mr. Behrens said. \u201cBut there are radical environmental out-of-state groups working to undermine that. And those connections need to be highlighted.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
