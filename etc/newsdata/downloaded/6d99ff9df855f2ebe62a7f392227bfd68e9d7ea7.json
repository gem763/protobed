The top three, he said, are General Dynamics, Oshkosh Defense, and BAE Systems.\n\nGeneral Dynamics recently emerged as the sole competitor for the OMFV intended to replace Bradley infantry fighting vehicle built by BAE Systems after Raytheon Rheinmetall Land Systems was disqualified and BAE Systems dropped out of the running.\n\nBoth General Dynamics and BAE Systems are competing to deliver the MPF, the Army's next light tank. And, Oshkosh Defense has secured significant contracts for its Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), which is replacing AM General's Humvee.\n\n\"The long-time, legacy competitors are in the market,\" Hernandez told Insider. \"They know how to present and how to prepare. They are well trusted. They've given the services good products.\"\n\nThese players have an edge, but there are still opportunities for other companies to get in on the action. \"The way to break into this market is to pair up and partner with these guys,\" he explained.\n\nThe Army is looking at things like modularity and open architecture, lighter but stronger armor, undercarriage protection to defend against IEDs, shock-absorbent seating, and wide fields of view, among other things. Companies that can integrate their technology into vehicle programs to meet these needs will likely have better luck breaking into the market.\n\nCompanies with strong vehicle programs also benefit from these connections.\n\n\"To contend in a highly established and consolidated market, OEMs [Original Equipment Manufacturers] need to start restructuring their platforms with a focus on open architecture,\" Hernandez further explains in his latest analysis.\n\nDefense firms that can develop open fire control architecture for a wide range of weapon systems on new combat vehicles, develop sensor architecture interoperable with other platforms, or provide light but reliable vehicles with increased capability but lower sustainment costs are likely to be much more competitive in this market, he said, offering another key to success.", "description": "The US Army is spending big on combat vehicles for future warfighting, which means lucrative opportunities for competitive defense firms.", "authors": ["Ryan Pickrell"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9cf87a3b33a71f14731047?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
