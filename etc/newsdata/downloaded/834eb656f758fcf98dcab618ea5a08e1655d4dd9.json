The initiative seeks to create an affordable (by Pentagon standards) unmanned combat aircraft that can carry out one-way missions if necessary. The Valkyrie is not able to make runway landings, and instead uses a parachute recovery system. Parachute technology for drones dates back to the 1970s \u2013 raising questions about why such a well-tested and proven system malfunctioned on the Valkyrie.\n\nKratos reportedly received $7 million from the US Air Force in 2016 towards the development of the drone \u2013 mere pennies compared to larger Pentagon contracts such as the F-35, which could end up costing taxpayers close to $1 trillion.\n\nAlso on rt.com Bolton says China stole F-35 because their jet \u2018looks like it\u2019 \u2013 are plane-snatchers everywhere?\n\nLike this story?
