ILHAN OMAR: It is quite disturbing to see a president have complete disregard for the rule of law, for tradition, for our constitution, and just blatantly enrich himself and his family. We can\u2019t continue to look the other way. We must do everything that we can to hold him accountable.\n\nDEAN OBEIDALLAH: It\u2019s remarkable that Republicans give him a pass on this. I mean, if President Obama had a chain of hotels \u2014 the Obama Inns \u2014 and was having events there, I can assure you they would have impeached him.\n\nREP. OMAR: Party over country is what the Republicans are going to be known for. It is quite disheartening, it brings me a lot of sadness. We see a lot of them so focused on their self-preservation, their protection of this president, their protection of his cabinet members, their protection of his corrupt children. And we don\u2019t see them working to protect this democracy, we don\u2019t see them working to uphold the rule of law. We don\u2019t see them pushing for the kind of transparency and accountability that they often times talk about and we\u2019re used to hearing them talk about.", "description": "Ilhan Omar said she finds it \"disturbing\" that President Trump will host the next G-7 summit at his resort\u00a0Trump National Doral in Miami.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/Ilhan-Omar-confused-ap-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
