At the center of the complaint was a phone call Trump had with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump admitted to discussing Biden.\n\nTrump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, allege that Biden meddled in a criminal investigation into Burisma Holdings, whose board Hunter sat on from April 2014 through early 2019. The investigation was being led by Ukraine's prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin. Biden pressed hard for Shokin to be fired for corruption when he visited the country in March 2016.\n\nBiden represented the US's official position on the matter, one that was shared by many other western governments and anticorruption activists in Ukraine, according to The Associated Press. However, Trump and Giuliani allege that Biden pushed for Shokin's ouster because he wanted to stymie the investigation into Burisma.\n\nBut there's a huge loophole in those claims: government officials and Ukrainian anticorruption advocates told The Wall Street Journal that Shokin had actually hampered the investigation into Burisma long before Biden even stepped into the picture.\n\nIn other words, Biden was doing the opposite of what Trump and Giuliani are implying: he was trying to oust a prosecutor who was slow-walking the investigation into Burisma, rather than actively targeting the company.\n\nWestern diplomats also say he essentially shut down one such investigation into Burisma's founder in the UK by refusing to cooperate with authorities. And Bloomberg reported that the Burisma investigation was largely dormant when Biden called for Shokin to be fired.\n\nRead more:'DEFCON 1': US officials are rocked by a whistleblower complaint involving Trump's talks with a foreign leader\n\nStill, Trump and Giuliani have pushed hard, both publicly and privately, for Ukraine to investigate Biden.\n\n\"You don't get to approve a prosecutor in a foreign country unless something fishy is going on,\" Giuliani said on Fox News Sunday.\n\nTrump's discussion of the matter with Zelensky \u2014 in which he called for another country to investigate his political opponent ahead of a presidential election \u2014 was so unprecedented that it prompted the whistleblower complaint. The Journal reported that Trump pressed Zelensky to work with Giuliani on the investigation at least eight times during their conversation.\n\nThe president said over the weekend that his conversation with Zelensky was \"largely congratulatory\" and \"largely the fact that we don't want our people like VP Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in Ukraine.\"\n\nThe whistleblower's complaint also references a \"promise\" Trump apparently made to Zelensky, but it's unclear what that was.\n\nSome have speculated in recent days that the Trump administration may have withheld a military aid package from Ukraine worth hundreds of millions of dollars to spur Zelensky's government to investigate Biden. But The Journal cited a person familiar with the matter who said they didn't believe Trump offered any quid-pro-quo during the call.\n\nHowever, the president gave some indication on Monday that he may have had the package on his mind while talking to Zelensky.\n\n\"It's very important to talk about corruption,\" Trump said. \"If you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt? It's very important that on occasion, you speak to somebody about corruption.\"\n\nYuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's current prosecutor general, said earlier this year that he had no evidence of wrongdoing against Biden or his son.\n\n\"I do not want Ukraine to again be the subject of US presidential elections,\" Lutsenko said. \"Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws ... at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing.\"", "description": "Ukrainian officials say Viktor Shokin had hampered the investigation into Burisma long before Biden even stepped into the picture.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8905c72e22af27f966a0b4-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
