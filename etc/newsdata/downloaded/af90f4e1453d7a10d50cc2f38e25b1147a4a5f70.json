So. Rich.\n\nAnd sad.\n\nIt\u2019s the brewing battle of the socialists, Bernie Sanders v. Elizabeth Warren, as they each try to distance themselves as far, far, far as possible from that dirty \u2014 gasp, sputter, spit \u2014 capitalism.\n\n\u201cThere are differences between Elizabeth and myself,\u201d Sanders said in a televised \u201cThis Week\u201d interview over the weekend, Fox News reported.\n\nDo tell.\n\nWell, \u201cElizabeth,\u201d he said, \u201cI think, you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\nWhat!\n\nWarren a capitalist? Warren a self-declared capitalist? Perish the thought. This is, after all, Amerika \u2014 letter \u201ck\u201d intended.\n\nSanders\u2018 statement comes after Warren admitted a year ago, \u201cI am a capitalist to my bones\u201d \u2014 word \u201cadmitted\u201d intended.\n\nHow sad that this is what the country\u2019s come to \u2014 that political candidates vying for presidential nominations feel the need to run from a capitalist label.\n\nThis is how Sanders runs: \u201c[I\u2019m not a capitalist because I] will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country, today, which is unnecessary.\u201d\n\nOh. What of this?\n\n\u201cHow Bernie Sanders, The Socialists Senator, Amassed A $2.5 Million Fortune,\u201d Forbes wrote in April.\n\nIgnore that.\n\n\u201cBernie Sanders and his wife earned $1.7 million in past two years, returns show,\u201d The Washington Post wrote in April.\n\nIgnore that, too.\n\n\u201cBernie Sanders Pockets $1 Million For Second Year in a Row,\u201d Newsweek wrote in June of 2018.\n\nThat too. Ignore all that.\n\nThose are called: Inconvenient Truths.\n\nAs in: If you\u2019re a socialist, you can write a book, market it on the campaign-funded trail and voila, earn a cool million \u2014 and still get by with denouncing capitalism and that dang racist, discriminatory, oppressive free market.\n\nAs in: If you\u2019re a socialist, you can turn accusing fingers at those who threaten your political career and simply denounce them as dirty capitalists \u2014 even though they\u2019re not. Not hardly. Even though they\u2019re cut from the same socialist cloth.\n\nEven though they hate capitalism so much they\u2019ve run a presidential campaign on the promise of getting Big Business and Wall Street. Warren, anyone?\n\nNo word, yet, on how Warren has responded to Sanders\u2018 vicious attack.\n\nBut make way for the fireworks.\n\n\u2018Cause if there\u2019s one thing a socialist-slash-progressive-slash-Democrat-masquerading-as-an-American hates, it\u2019s being called a capitalist.\n\nIt\u2019s just tragic that this is the precipice where America now stands \u2014 at a spot where capitalism, a gift that\u2019s enriched and benefited so many, and for so long, has become a dirty word. It\u2019s just a travesty that making money in America using personal ingenuity, creativity, hard work and dedication has become a political albatross.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
