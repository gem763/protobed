Those experts say the current level, 15 parts per billion (ppb), is too high to meaningfully reduce the blood lead levels of children who are exposed.\n\nAnd the rule establishes a new two-tier system for addressing lead contamination.\n\nWhen a city's water hits a new 10 ppb \"trigger\" level, cities would be required to reevaluate their water treatment processes and possibly add corrosion-control chemicals to city water.\n\nOnly at 15 ppb must cities begin to replace the full length of all of the lead service lines in their system. Under the new proposal, though, cities would be required to replace 3 percent of lead service lines each year -- lower than the current requirement of 7 percent.\n\nCritics worry easing regulations on how quickly cities must replace their pipes will ensure lead stays in the system even longer.\n\nMore on the controversial proposed rule here.\n\nCOMMERCE DID IT: Commerce Department officials were responsible for drafting a statement that rebuked National Weather Service staff after they sent a tweet countering President Trump's statements on Hurricane Dorian, according to a letter sent by the House Science committee Thursday.\n\nThe letter sent by House Science, Space and Technology Chair Eddie Bernice Johnson Eddie Bernice JohnsonTexas Democrat says she'll run for 'one last term' after 'much pressure and encouragement' The two most important mental health reforms the Trump administration should consider Democrats ramp up calls to investigate NOAA MORE (D-Texas) to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross Wilbur Louis RossWhite House tells Pelosi, committee chairs it won't cooperate with impeachment inquiry Lawmaker, scientists challenge Trump officials' push to disband two key advisory boards Overnight Energy: Lawmaker, scientists challenge move to eliminate key advisory boards | White House nixes climate language from emissions proposal | Raffle offers deer hunt with Donald Trump Jr. MORE wrote that interviews that took place with administration staff this week revealed it was Commerce Department officials, not NOAA staff, who were responsible for sending the controversial letter.\n\nIn the interview with Neil Jacobs, the acting administrator at NOAA, the committee found that an unsigned Sept. 6 statement that disavowed NWS staff in Alabama was orchestrated by Ross's chief of staff and three other top deputies.\n\nThe statement read, \"The Birmingham National Weather Service's Sunday morning tweet spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\"\n\nIt responded to a tweet by National Weather Service's Birmingham office that wrote \"Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east.\"\n\nTrump had previously tweeted that the hurricane could potential hit the state.\n\nThe interview with Science committee staff also confirmed reporting that White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney John (Mick) Michael MulvaneyHouse Democrat breaks from party, says House should vote to start impeachment inquiry The Hill's Morning Report - White House escalates impeachment battle royal House leaders ask Supreme Court to reject Trump challenge to consumer bureau MORE was directly involved in \"high-level\" conversations surrounding the statement, according to the letter.\n\nRead more on the letter here.\n\nDON'T POLITICIZE ME: Nearly 600 former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) officials are asking House leadership to investigate the agency for appearing to place undue focus on California's pollution enforcement, an act they argue is politicized.\n\nIn a Thursday letter sent to both the House Oversight and Reform Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee, the former EPA employees ask Democratic leadership to investigate whether warnings issued by agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler to California in September, regarding the state's homeless population and pollution concerns, were done as retaliation for ongoing pushback to President Trump's air enforcement agenda.\n\n\"EPA's credibility depends on its commitment to use its authority to protect public health and our environment in an objective, even-handed manner, rather than as a blunt instrument of political power. While that principle has served the public well under both Republican and Democratic Presidents, it is in serious trouble today,\" read the letter, signed by former Obama EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy Regina (Gina) McCarthyIt's time for Congress to address the 'forever chemical' crisis Overnight Energy: Critics accuse Interior's top lawyer of misleading Congress | Boaty McBoatface makes key climate change discovery | Outrage over Trump's order to trim science advisory panels Trump's order to trim science advisory panels sparks outrage MORE and others.\n\nIn late September.

It was the latest move in the political battle between Trump and the nation's largest state, and one experts have said carries no scientific merit.\n\nThe EPA pushed back in a statement, saying California's failures on air and water create \"public health risks\" for its population.\n\n\"Highlighting that California has the worst air quality in the nation along with other serious environmental problems is not a political issue. The Trump Administration, unlike the previous administration, will act to protect public health and the environment for all Americans,\" EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said.\n\nThe letter from the former employees comes as the Environmental Integrity Project unveiled an investigatory deep dive that found via the EPA's enforcement database that many states, not just California, were out of compliance with EPA regulations when it comes to wastewater discharge violations.\n\nAccording to the internal EPA data, Ohio, New York and Iowa were the biggest offenders.\n\nThe Kicker?: Wheeler is from Ohio.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nOUTSIDE THE BELTWAY:\n\nNewsom says PG&E power blackouts are frustrating but necessary to prevent fires, the Los Angeles Times reports.\n\nNew York state to take IJC to court over Lake Ontario flooding damage, The Buffalo News reports.\n\nNinth Circuit orders thaw of Obama-era energy efficiency standards, The Courthouse News Service reports.\n\nICYMI: Stories from Thursday...\n\n-Commerce staff drafted statement rebuking weather service for contradicting Trump's hurricane predictions\n\n-Hundreds of former EPA officials call for House probe, say agency's focus on California is politicized\n\n-House Democrats subpoena Rick Perry in impeachment inquiry\n\n-California bans small plastic bottles in hotels\n\n-EPA to overhaul rule on testing for lead contamination\n\n-Sierra Club sues EPA over claim that climate change 'is 50 to 75 years out'\n\n-Climate change activists seek to halt flights at London City Airport\n\n-Coal demand projected to hit new lows through 2020\n\n-Hundreds of birds face extinction due to climate change: study\n\n-Trump struggles to win back Iowa farmers with new ethanol plan", "description": "PERRY IN HOT WATER WITH DEMS: House Democrats on Thursday subpoenaed Energy Secretary Rick Perry for documentation of his involvement with President Trump's efforts to push the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice Presi", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/perryrick_040318gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
