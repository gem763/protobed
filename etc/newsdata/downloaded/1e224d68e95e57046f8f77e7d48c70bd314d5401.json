Our K-12 System Should Reflect That.", "language": "en", "text": "The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com.\n\nNew York City made waves in the education world when a group of experts selected by its mayor proposed eliminating gifted and talented programs.\n\nNo matter what you think of this move, there\u2019s no denying the issue it aims to address: our current education system reinforces inequality rather than eliminating it. A phenomenon known as \u201ctracking\u201d or \u201cability grouping\u201d separates the \u201cgifted\u201d students from the \u201caverage\u201d students. The former group gets placed on a college-readiness track, taking honors and AP courses, while the latter group gets placed in a vocational track, where they take courses oriented towards trades and other blue-collar jobs.\n\nWe should know better than this by now. A student with incredible academic ability could have a passion for the hands-on work of design or manufacturing. Another student could have a passion for building things that would benefit both from the more theoretical approach of AP Calculus or Physics and from practical, skills-based career technical education. It\u2019s time we reject the simplistic binary of college-ready or not, and instead embrace the fact that our students are complicated human beings with unique needs. They all deserve to have a full menu of educational and career-oriented options to choose from.\n\nBlended learning is one of the best ways to give them that. As its name implies, blended learning is a form of education that brings together two traditionally distinct teaching methods. It combines online courses with in-person, brick-and-mortar instruction, and it ideally throws into the mix opportunities for dual enrollment in college or university courses. Ultimately, this highly personalized instructional approach intends to give students the widest variety of options in terms of course content, design and delivery so they can carve out the path that works best for them.\n\nAside from \u2013 most importantly \u2013 moving away from that two-track mentality, another perk of this approach is that it can save students money on future higher education costs. Today, most students are limited to the courses offered at their local high school, and while these might meet general education requirements, they often don\u2019t give students the chance to explore an individual passion from all angles, nor allow them to start working toward their career goals early. When students can access a variety of classes and take classes that meet college expectations while they\u2019re still in high school, they can potentially save thousands of dollars in tuition costs.\n\nNow, perhaps more than ever, this option is critical: more than 90% of both parents and students surveyed in side-by-side polls said more opportunities for high schoolers to earn college credit could help solve the student debt crisis.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason so many schools have resisted blended learning models. It\u2019s far easier to develop one or two standardized approaches than to deal with the infinite number of permutations that result when you open schools\u2019 and therefore students\u2019 doors to blended learning. But the truth is, Americans are waking up to the fact that this two-size-fits-all approach isn\u2019t working anymore. As New York City\u2019s motion to eliminate gifted classes indicates, people are rejecting the narrative that certain learners are simply vocational-track students and second-class citizens, as well as the idea that college readiness is more important than career readiness. Those same polls found the majority of parents and students don\u2019t believe schools are \u201cdoing enough to prepare students for a career after graduation.\u201d\n\nThe more we embrace the tailored approach of blended learning, the more we\u2019ll be able to hone students\u2019 unique gifts and prepare them to thrive in the workforce of the future \u2013 regardless of their background or family story. It\u2019s a major change, yes, but it\u2019s one that will bring about the equality and opportunity that every child deserves.\n\nPat Michel is vice president of career readiness program design at K12.", "description": "New York City\u00a0made waves in the education world when a .10/12/2019 2:45:33AM EST.", "authors": ["Pat", "Timothy Meads", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2010/156/3f42beff-9221-4df2-897a-34b25f638405@news.ap.org.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
