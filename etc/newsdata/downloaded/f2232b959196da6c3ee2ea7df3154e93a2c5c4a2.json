REUTERS/Khalil Ashawi\n\nTurkey\u2019s cross-border attack in northern Syria against Kurdish forces widened to target the town of Suluk which was hit by Ankara\u2019s Syrian rebel allies. There were conflicting accounts on the outcome of the fighting.\n\nTurkey is facing threats of possible sanctions from the United States unless it calls off the incursion. Two of its NATO allies, Germany and France, have said they are halting weapons exports to Turkey. The Arab League has denounced the operation.\n\nAnkara launched the assault against the Kurdish YPG militia after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew some U.S. troops from the border region. Ankara says the YPG is a terrorist group aligned with Kurdish militants waging an insurgency in Turkey.\n\nTurkey\u2019s stated objective is to set up a \u201csafe zone\u201d inside Syria to resettle many of the 3.6 million Syrian war refugees it has been hosting. President Tayyip Erdogan has threatened to send them to Europe if the EU does not back his assault.\n\nBut the Turkish incursion has raised international alarm over large-scale displacements of civilians and, amidst the upheaval, the possibility of Islamic State militants escaping from prisons run by the Kurdish-led authorities.\n\nThe Kurdish-led forces have been the main regional ally of the United States against Islamic State in Syria.\n\nThe region\u2019s Kurdish-led administration said in a statement that 785 IS-affiliated foreigners had fled the camp at Ain Issa.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, citing sources in the camp, said around 100 people had escaped.\n\nIn apparent reference to Turkish-backed rebels, the Kurdish-led administration said \u201cmercenaries\u201d attacked the camp where \u201cDaesh elements\u201d - a reference to Islamic State - in turn attacked camp guards and opened the gates.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) hold swathes of territory that was once part of Islamic State\u2019s \u201ccaliphate\u201d. The SDF has been keeping thousands of IS jihadists in jail and tens of thousands of their family members in camps.\n\nSDF official Marvan Qamishlo told Reuters there were not have enough guards for the camp, which is north of Raqqa and about 30 km (20 miles) south of the Turkish border.\n\n\u201cThe guarding is very weak now,\u201d he said, adding there were now just 60-70 security personnel at the camp compared with a normal level of no less than 700 in the camp of 12,000 people.\n\nTURKISH-LED ADVANCE\n\nAlong the front lines, Turkish forces and Syrian rebels entered Suluk, some 10 km (6 miles) from Turkey\u2019s border, the Observatory said on Sunday.\n\nTurkey\u2019s state-owned Anadolu news agency said the rebels seized complete control of Suluk. But the SDF\u2019s Qamishlo said SDF forces had repelled the attack and were still in control.\n\nSuluk is southeast of the Syrian border town of Tel Abyad, one of the two main targets in the incursion, which was bombarded by Turkish howitzers on Sunday afternoon, a witness in the neighboring Turkish town of Akcakale said.\n\nMachinegun fire resounded around the Syrian frontier town of Ras al Ain, 120 km (75 miles) to the east of Tel Abyad, while Turkish artillery continued to target the area, a Reuters reporter across the border in Turkey\u2019s Ceylanpinar said.\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian rebels, known as the National Army, advanced into Ras al Ain on Saturday but by Sunday there were still conflicting reports on which side was prevailing in the town.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory said the SDF, in which the YPG comprises the main fighting element, had recovered \u201calmost full control\u201d of Ras al Ain after a counter-attack.\n\nA spokesman for the National Army denied this, saying its forces were still in the positions they took on Saturday.\n\n130,000 DISPLACED\n\nMore than 130,000 people have been displaced from rural areas around Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain as a result of the fighting, the United Nations said on Sunday.\n\nThe U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said OCHA and other relief agencies estimated up to 400,000 civilians in the Syrian conflict zone may require aid and protection in the coming period.\n\nErdogan has dismissed the growing international condemnation of the military operation, saying Turkey \u201cwill not stop it, no matter what anyone says\u201d.\n\nIn the latest criticism, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Erdogan the offensive may worsen the humanitarian situation and undermine progress toward weakening Islamic State, urging an end to the operation.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Defence Ministry said on Sunday 480 YPG militants had been \u201cneutralized\u201d since the operation began, a term that commonly means killed. The SDF said 76 of its fighters have been killed.\n\nThe Observatory said 104 SDF fighters, 76 Turkey-backed rebels and 52 civilians had been killed in the conflict.\n\nIn Turkey, 18 civilians have been killed in cross-border bombardment, Turkish media and officials say.\n\nThe SDF on Saturday urged the U.S.-led coalition to close air space to Turkish jets, saying SDF fighters were \u201cbeing martyred by Turkish warplanes in front of the eyes of the allies\u201d.\n\nIslamic State claimed responsibility for a car bomb on Friday in Qamishli, the largest city in the Kurdish-held area, where some IS militants fled from a jail.\n\nOn Saturday Trump defended his decision to withdraw troops in the Syrian border region, telling conservative Christian activists that the United States should prioritize protecting its own borders.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\n\u201cLet them have their borders, but I don\u2019t think our soldiers should be there for the next 50 years guarding a border between Turkey and Syria when we can\u2019t guard our own borders at home,\u201d Trump said in a speech in Washington.\n\nThe SDF accused Turkey-backed rebels of killing a Kurdish politician in a road ambush on Saturday. The rebel force denied it, saying it had not advanced that far.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory said Turkey-backed groups had killed nine civilians on the road, including Hervin Khalaf, co-chair of the secular Future Syria Party.", "description": "Women affiliated with Islamic State and their children fled en masse from a camp where they were being held in northern Syria on Sunday after shelling by Turkish forces in a five-day-old offensive, the region's Kurdish-led administration said.", "authors": ["Tom Perry", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440302865&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C06K", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
