This whistle-blower, we\u2019re to believe, began working at CNN two years ago in an idealistic time when he had no clue the network was a left-leaning outlet. He claims getting the job was \u201ca dream come true.\u201d\n\nThen he found out that some of the employees, including the network President, didn\u2019t like Trump.\n\nA 20-minute video released by Project Veritas today features Poarch and a cast of CNN employees having vague discussions about bias intermingled with audio from CNN president Jeff Zucker. None of it is particularly interesting.\n\nThe video shows that Zucker wants the network focused on covering Trump, especially as the impeachment proceedings start heating up. The editing makes it look like he\u2019s saying CNN wants Trump impeached, but that\u2019s unclear \u2013 either way, the point is that Zucker doesn\u2019t like Trump. He also calls Fox news a propaganda machine that\u2019s dangerous for the country.\n\nA few minutes of the video is dedicated to pointing out that many CNN employees came to work visibly upset the day after Trump was elected. Some employees appear to feel the network gives Democrats softball questions during interviews but are tougher on Republicans. And, according to the video, several employees think CNN is biased against Trump.\n\n\"The fake conspiracy nonsense that @FoxNews has spread for years is now deeply embedded in American society\u2026and frankly that is beyond destructive for America.\" \u2013 @CNN President Jeff Zucker MORE COMING: https://t.co/kDe3HDdX2r#ExposeCNN pic.twitter.com/iZZBoKg533 \u2014 James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) October 14, 2019\n\nCNN Media Coordinator Nick Neville: \u201cHannity is truly conservative, he lets you know. However, Don Lemon makes you think he\u2019s objective news \u2026 he\u2019s blatantly anti-Trump, he\u2019s blatantly left. CNN makes it appear as though we have 24 hours of unbiased news. That\u2019s not true\u201d pic.twitter.com/V5BEkRQBuG \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 14, 2019\n\nOther revelations include the shocking truth about Don Lemon and Anderson Cooper: they\u2019re politically left-leaning. Is your mind blown right now? Wait until Project Veritas finds out that Tucker Carlson and Bill O\u2019Reilly are right-leaning.\n\nThe only revelation is that there\u2019s allegedly hundreds of hours of people at CNN being secretly recorded and this is the best stuff they got. No harassment? No bigotry or misogyny? It\u2019s uncanny.\n\nThe people at Project Veritas represent the worst of Alex Jones\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m just asking questions\u201d method of journalism. They push conspiracy theories until they\u2019re debunked and then move on to the next one. They pay people to lie in order to trick journalists into dignifying their conspiracy theories, and then claim ignorance in court. They\u2019re bottom-feeders and provocateurs, and they\u2019re dangerous.\n\nRelated: Project Veritas and \u2018whistle-blower\u2019 published bullshit \u2018data-leak\u2019 to dox Google employees\n\nThe message here isn\u2019t that CNN is biased, because all news outlets are biased one way or another. It\u2019s that CNN is biased and nobody is doing anything to stop it. This is a tactic Project Veritas uses often. It once pushed a conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton was running a pedophile ring out of the basement of a pizza restaurant. Its members continued this rhetoric until a man walked into the restaurant with a gun, demanded access to the basement, and then shot at a storage room when he found out the building had no basement.\n\nMeanwhile a violent \u201cparody\u201d video created by Project Veritas associates at TheGeekzTeam \u2013 whose member CarpeDonktum was called \u201cthe genius\u201d by Trump when the two met \u2013 was shown at a conservative conference over the weekend. The two seemingly unrelated events have a lot of overlap. CarpeDonktum and James O\u2019Keefe, and by extension TheGeekzTeam and Project Veritas, are known to promote each other\u2019s work and both share a near-identical fan base.\n\nBREAKING: @CarpeDonktum 's account has been SUSPENDED. I spoke with Logan Cook, who I shared an exclusive CNN clip with \u2014 and his account was suspended immediately upon posting one of the clips where Christian Sierra of CNN DISCUSSING COVERAGE OF SHOOTINGS\u2026 pic.twitter.com/KSdgdqYAcv \u2014 James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) October 14, 2019\n\nThe video depicts a church shooting scene from the movie \u201cThe Kingsman\u201d with Donald Trump\u2018s face superimposed over the shooter\u2019s and his political and media enemies over the victims\u2019. While dozens of \u201cenemies\u201d of the president are shown in the \u201cparody,\u201d it\u2019s interesting to note that the scene ends with \u201cTrump\u201d burying an axe in \u201cCNN.\u201d\n\nThe video\u2019s been around for months, but nobody seems to know how it found its way into the conference this weekend. It was shown \u201con a small tv in an empty room for a few hours during a three-day event,\u201d according to CarpeDonktum. Subsequent media coverage has ensured it\u2019s been seen by millions online since.\n\nAs tempting as it is to laugh at the clownery from these people when they bumble about pretending to be journalists and influencers, it\u2019s important to remember that their target social media audience takes them seriously.", "description": "", "authors": ["Tristan Greene"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FPVtrump.jpg&signature=b54a84a7f6d7bf8afc7c3910709a4876", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
