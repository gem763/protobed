Yovanovitch expressed her \u201cdeep disappointment and dismay\u201d at efforts to undermine trust in American institutions, and warned that \u201cthis nation\u2019s most loyal and talented public servants\u201d are running for the exits. She also said other countries would likely exploit the same dynamic that led to her ouster to undermine U.S. foreign policy.\n\nYovanovitch, who remains a State Department employee, was the latest firsthand witness to testify about Trump's interactions with Ukraine, as he ramped up efforts to pressure the country's new president to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a 2020 contender. The chairs of the three House committees leading the investigation said the State Department and the White House had ordered Yovanovitch not to attend, prompting them to issue a subpoena. Yovanovitch, they said, agreed to comply with the subpoena over her agency's objections.\n\n\u201cAny efforts by Trump administration officials to prevent witness cooperation with the committees will be deemed obstruction of a co-equal branch of government and an adverse inference may be drawn against the president on the underlying allegations of corruption and cover-up,\u201d said Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) and Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.).\n\nUnlike the last witness in the Ukraine matter to testify \u2014 former ambassador Kurt Volker \u2014 Yovanovitch is still employed by the State Department, which raises questions about whether she'll face any punishment for defying orders. Legal experts and State Department officials have been trying, without conclusion, to resolve the question of whether a congressional subpoena trumps a State Department direction to a Foreign Service officer.\n\nAccording to her statement, Yovanovitch was told \u201cabruptly\u201d in late April to return to Washington \u201con the next plane.\u201d Her removal came amid a campaign by Trump supporters to accuse her of disloyalty, a charge she said was \u201cfictitious.\u201d Trump himself attacked Yovanovitch during a phone call with Ukraine's newly elected president Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25, which is at the center of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. Trump referred to her as \u201cbad news,\" according to a summary of the conversation released by the White House. He also said, without elaboration, that she was \u201cgoing to go through some things.\u201d\n\nYovanovitch's appearance on Capitol Hill Friday was a breakthrough for House Democrats seeking firsthand details about Trump's efforts \u2014 both directly and through his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani \u2014 to pressure Ukraine's leaders to investigate Biden.\n\nYovanovitch said she had \u201cminimal contacts\u201d with Giuliani, adding: \u201cI do not know Mr. Giuliani\u2019s motives for attacking me.\u201d She speculated that Giuliani\u2019s associates \u201cbelieved that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nShe also said U.S. interests are \u201charmed\u201d when \u201cprivate interests circumvent professional diplomats for their own gain, not the public good.\u201d It appeared to be a reference to Giuliani\u2019s efforts to leverage government officials to dig up dirt on Biden.\n\n\u201cThe harm will come when bad actors in countries beyond Ukraine see how easy it is to use fiction and innuendo to manipulate our system,\u201d she said. \u201cIn such circumstances, the only interests that will be served are those of our strategic adversaries, like Russia, that spread chaos and attack the institutions and norms that the U.S. helped create and which we have benefited from for the last 75 years.\u201d\n\nThe State Department\u2019s inspector general last Wednesday briefed congressional aides about an apparent attempt to smear the veteran civil servant. Two foreign-born associates of Giuliani \u2014 both indicted Thursday on campaign finance charges \u2014 have also been accused of seeking her removal at the behest of an unnamed Ukrainian government official.\n\nYovanovitch is a highly regarded diplomat within the U.S. foreign policy establishment. At the State Department, her treatment has unnerved many staffers, especially in the division that handles Europe. It also has damaged the standing of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has been unwilling to publicly defend Yovanovitch.\n\nMorale in the department was rattled even further this week after it was announced that Mike McKinley, a veteran career diplomat who serves as a top adviser to Pompeo, was resigning. The reasons for his departure, confirmed to POLITICO by a senior Trump administration official, were not clear, but the timing is not helping the mood, people in the department say.\n\nYovanovitch said in her opening statement that the State Department has been \u201cattacked and hollowed out from within.\u201d\n\nJust as Yovanovitch agreed to testify, Trump\u2019s representative to the European Union, Gordon Sondland announced Friday morning that he would sit for a deposition next week, after similarly receiving a congressional subpoena.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the State Department\u2019s current direction to not testify, Ambassador Sondland will honor the Committees\u2019 subpoena, and he looks forward to testifying on Thursday,\u201d his attorneys said in a statement.\n\nBut Sondland\u2019s lawyers also said he would not be able to comply with House Democrats\u2019 subpoena for documents, saying that \u201cfederal law and State Department regulations prohibit him from producing documents concerning his official responsibilities.\u201d Some Republicans have been eager to let Sondland, a firm Trump ally, testify in a bid to buttress Trump's position.\n\nHarold Koh, a former State Department legal adviser, said his interpretation is that a congressional subpoena would outweigh a State Department directive. He noted that it\u2019s also possible that, facing such a situation, State could order a staffer to limit his or her testimony, for example, by not discussing classified information.\n\nIt's not clear if State will or even would be allowed to punish Yovanovitch. But sometimes such punishments are veiled. Yovanovitch could find herself given low-ranking assignments in the future, with no official reason as to why. There already are at least two federal investigations ongoing into whether, under Trump, State Department career employees have been victims of political retaliation, including being given low-level roles.\n\nThe State Department did not respond to a query Friday as to whether they would punish Yovanovitch or Sondland.\n\nSondland's name emerged in a series of text messages provided to House investigators by Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations who resigned days before testifying last week. In the text chain, Sondland, Volker and Bill Taylor \u2014 currently the top U.S. envoy in Ukraine \u2014 discussed apparent efforts by Trump and Giuliani to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden, perhaps by withholding a planned White House visit or military aid.\n\nYovanovitch said she was not involved in discussions about Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky, or about the military aid, which was temporarily withheld earlier this year. House Democrats are examining whether the critical funds were frozen as a way to convince Zelensky to target Trump\u2019s political rovals.\n\nVolker, Sondland and Yovanovitch were among several senior State Department officials listed in a schedule of depositions that accompanied a subpoena for documents delivered late last month to Pompeo by the three House Democratic chairmen leading the impeachment probe.\n\nPompeo rebuffed the committee leaders in a letter last Tuesday, signaling that he would not comply with their requests and writing that he would \u201cuse all means at my disposal to prevent and expose any attempts to intimidate the dedicated professionals whom I am proud to lead and serve alongside at the Department of State.\u201d\n\nQuint Forgey contributed to this story.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/1c/39/9392d7d2462b808443a833563c0e/191011-marie-yovanovitch-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
