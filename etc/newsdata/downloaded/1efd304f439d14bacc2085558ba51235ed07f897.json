It could take as many as four weeks for authorities to positively identify the bodies.\n\nBuffalo Police Department via Facebook\n\n\"The vehicle was completely incinerated. The contents inside the vehicle was nothing more than ashes,\" Buffalo Police Capt. Jeff Rinaldo told reporters Thursday. \"We can now positively identify that vehicle as being the vehicle that the family rented and drove to Buffalo, New York, in.\"\n\nSurveillance footage showed two people walking with a child near the area where the vehicle was burned. One of the people was seen with a T-shirt over their head and carrying two gasoline cans, according to police.\n\nThe video also shows the boy the two persons of interest running away from what appears to be a burning car.\n\nThe child's family is working to gain custody and return him to his home in Central Florida. He is currently in child protective services.\n\nBuffalo Police Department via Facebook\n\n\"We're heartbroken, we're worried, we're scared,\" Noelvin\u2019s grandfather, Jorge Oquendo, told Orlando ABC affiliate WFTV on Wednesday. \"We're all devastated. ... We're all devastated for a lot of reasons. We have no answers, we don't know what happened, we don't know if it happened.\"\n\nThe boy's grandmother is scheduled to appear in Buffalo for a second custody hearing in October, authorities said. Her previous request for custody was denied.", "description": "The video showed two unidentified people walking with a child who police believed to be 3-year-old Noelvin.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/missing-boy-ht-jef-190918_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
