The company, based in Ralston, Virginia, has been partly owned since 2013 by a company in which the president\u2019s younger brother, Robert Trump, is a stakeholder, according to the Post.\n\nAfter the award, an anonymous competitor filed a complaint with the Justice Department\u2019s Office of the Inspector General, according to a July letter obtained by the Post. It claimed that CertiPath had failed to disclose that \u201cone of the president\u2019s closest living relatives stood to benefit financially from the transaction.\u201d\n\nRobert Trump\u2019s \u201cfinancial interest in the company even as it trades on the Trump name present the appearance of preferential treatment for those who are close to the president,\u201d the letter states, according to the Post.\n\nNMR Consulting also filed an unrelated protest about the bid with the Government Accountability Office in July, the Post reported.\n\nThe information emerges just over a week after the Trump administration announced \u2014 then rescinded \u2014 a decision to host the Group of Seven summit next year at the president\u2019s own golf resort in Doral, Florida. The decision to host world leaders for the international event at a location that would directly benefit the president triggered harsh criticism and raised concerns about how such decisions are made and contracts awarded in the Trump administration.\n\nCertiPath\u2019s president and founder, Jeff Nigriny, said in a statement to the Post that that Robert Trump \u201cis one investor in an entity which holds a minority interest in Certipath.\u201d Trump is a \u201cpassive investor, has no management role whatsoever, is not an officer or director, and his name has never been used or mentioned by Certipath in any solicitation for a government contract,\u201d the statement added.\n\nCertiPath has been paid more than $6 million in government contracts since Donald Trump has been in office, according to the Post, citing federal data.\n\nNo money has yet been paid to CertiPath for the latest contract. The bid protest by NMR Consulting resulted in a \u201cstop work order\u201d on the contract, Marshals Service spokesman Drew Wade told the Post.\n\nWade did not reveal what the complaint concerns, but said it \u201chas nothing to do with the president or his relationships.\u201d He also said the Marshals Service had been unaware that a Trump relative was linked to CertiPath.\n\nRobert Trump could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nRead the full Washington Post report here.\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?
