How can LGBT people trust that you won\u2019t compromise on issues that put them at risk in order to reach across the aisle to people like Pence?\u201d\n\nWATCH: Fmr. VP Biden is asked at LGBTQ presidential forum why he should be trusted not to compromise on issues, following statements Biden made praising VP Pence as a \u201cdecent guy.\u201d pic.twitter.com/u88WbzCKYj\n\n\u2013 NBC News (@NBCNews) September 21, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nBiden responded that he was the first legislator to support gay marriage before anyone else did nationally.

When he asked his father about what he saw, the elder Biden responded, \u201cJoey, it\u2019s simple. They love each other. Period.\u201d\n\nBiden then addressed previously calling Pence \u201cdecent.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo refer to someone on the other team as being \u2018decent\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s a way in which you usually speak when you try to get things done,\u201d Biden explained.\n\n\u201cI still call President Trump \u2018president,\u2019 but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s all that decent,\u201d Biden said to applause.\n\nBiden\u2019s comments came on the same day as reports that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden\u2019s son, Hunter.\n\nWhile Biden didn\u2019t address the Ukraine reports in Idaho, he did release a statement earlier in the day. \u201cIf these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump\u2019s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country. This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cSuch clear-cut corruption damages and diminishes our institutions of government by making them tools of a personal political vendetta. At minimum, Donald Trump should immediately release the transcript of the call in question, so that the American people can judge for themselves, and direct the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to stop stonewalling and release the whistleblower notification to the Congress,\u201d it continued. In addition to boasting about his previous legislative record on LGBTQ rights, Biden added that he would undo all the restrictions implemented by the Trump administration, sign the Equality Act ensuring equal rights for LGBTQ individuals, allow prisoners to be assigned to prisons that match their gender identity, outlaw attempts at gay conversion, and have his health care plan cover gender transition surgery.\n\nRead original story Joe Biden Doesn\u2019t Think Donald Trump Is \u2018All That Decent\u2019 But Still Addresses Him as \u2018President\u2019 At TheWrap", "description": "Joe Biden said on Friday that he addresses Donald Trump with the respect to which the office of the President is entitled, even though he doesn\u2019t think Trump is \u201call that decent.\u201dBiden made his comments as he and several other top Democratic presidential candidates \u2014 including rivals Pete Buttigieg,", "authors": ["Lawrence Yee"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yYzv5KjwKq17MOCwjvylqg--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MTg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thewrap.com/d4798472f5dd3f4602aec9cf674b9ea4", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
