Moreover, the pair traded below a major bullish trend line with support near 1.2400.\n\nThe recent decline was such that the pair settled below the 1.2350 level and the 100 simple moving average (red, 4-hours). However, the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the 1.1958 low to 1.2582 acted as a support.\n\nBesides, the 200 simple moving average (green, 4-hours) also provided support near 1.2270. If there are more downsides, the next key support is near the 1.2230 level (the previous resistance).\n\nAny further downsides might push the pair towards the 1.2200 support or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the 1.1958 low.\n\nOn the upside, the previous supports near 1.2380 and 1.2400 are likely to stop gains. Therefore, a successful close above the 1.2400 level and the 100 SMA is must for a fresh increase in the coming sessions.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Titan FX covering: .
