This gives players of the free-to-play game the chance to spend their Riot Points on some avatar bling that might mirror real-life luxury and excess.\n\nAlong with nouveau chic champions and real-life clothes, the real world coveted Summoner\u2019s Cup, one of the most acclaimed trophies in esports, will be encased in a Vuitton-designed travel trunk that would feature both \u201ctraditional Louis Vuitton savoir-faire along with cutting-edge, high-tech elements\u201d inspired by the one of the most popular games in the world. Just last year, the FIFA World Cup was encased in a LV case and guarded by two burly men. The \u201chigh-tech\u201d elements will be revealed closer to the upcoming world championship in November.\n\n\u201cBoth sides want to make sure that the collaboration appeals to both of our respective audiences,\u201d said Naz Aletaha, Riot Games\u2019 head of global esports partnerships and business development. \u201cEsports is the next frontier for a lot of brands who have been in the traditional sport space.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt presents an unprecedented opportunity to bring our historical commitment to merging innovation and tradition with our spirit of adventure to a new generation,\u201d said Michael Burke, Louis Vuitton chairman and CEO in a prepared statement.\n\nThe partnership comes ahead of the League of Legends World Championship in Europe, which begins in Berlin on Oct. 2 and ends in Paris with the bespoke case and trophy on Nov. 10.\n\nFor several recent years, traditional sports ambassadors and executives have invested heavily into esports. Sports brands like Nike are signing on to produce gear for players, while Fortnite star player Tyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins announced a partnership with Adidas earlier this year.\n\n[Jared Jeffries was a rising NBA executive, then he decided to embrace esports]\n\nLeague of Legends is already celebrated by artists and music stars, so Riot Games felt fashion was the next step to engaging players. The characters in the game are already designed to be ultrachic fashionistas, and last year Riot Games released a hit song with famous k-pop stars and a music video that boasts more than 260 million views on YouTube.\n\nThe skins give players the chance to soup up their characters and show off to other players. Fortnite, another free-to-play game, makes millions a month selling skins (different characters and outfits) to players. Epic Games\u2019s partnership last year with the NFL\u2019s partnership falls in a similar vein.\n\nWhile the concept of spending hard-earned cash for virtual looks seem strange to nongamers, it makes perfect sense for hobbyists. In an elementary sense, they\u2019re like putting stickers on a book cover. Or as Vox\u2019s Rebecca Jennings once wrote of Fortnite skins, \u201csnagging a rare Fortnite skin instead of a Zara bag that everyone already owns actually makes a lot of sense.\u201d\n\n[Network seeks to become MTV for the gamer generation]\n\nAs for the trophy, it was created by the famed shop of Thomas Lyte, a British brand that created some of sport\u2019s most sumptuous looking trophies, including, unsurprisingly, the Louis Vuitton America\u2019s Cup. The trophy itself is so heavy, it reportedly takes about five people to hoist it. Gaming site Rock Paper Shotgun has a breakdown of the famous cup, including who those mysterious cloaked figures are (spoiler alert: they\u2019re summoners).\n\nMike Hume contributed to this report.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nEvery Zelda game, ranked\n\nA Madden tournament shooting survivor tried to move on.
