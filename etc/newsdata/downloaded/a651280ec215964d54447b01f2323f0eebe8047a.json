The seven-acre property, one of the choicest pieces of real estate on the island\u2019s famed north shore, is playing host for a small gathering with about a dozen local movers and shakers. The lavish $33 million estate is an idyllic, unique setting for any wine tasting dinner\u2014let alone one hosted by the winery\u2019s owner at his family home.\n\nThe group has been welcomed for an intimate wine tasting at the home of Peter Dartley, the owner of Argentina\u2019s Casarena Winery. Dartley made his fortune in finance, and took on the winery as a side project, which blossomed into his passion. He's holding court and leading a tasting through some of his latest releases, in what is arguably the most exclusive wine tasting on the planet\u2014at least for the evening. Playing maestro is the man who set the event up for his best customers, a certified sommelier, owner of Princeville Wine Market, and self-declared wine mystic Daniel Braun.\n\nThe Emergence of Exclusive, Bespoke Wine Events\n\nBraun gathered some of his local supporters together for the aforementioned event to offer them a unique experience. Surely, some Casarena wine would be sold, as Dartley personally brought his wines to life in front of a crew of wealthy tasters and collectors, but there\u2019s much more to it than that.\n\nWhile Braun bolsters the island\u2019s wine culture by fostering community, providing access, and increasing knowledge, his own status as the go-to wine guy on Kauai\u2019s north shore will be buoyed at the same time.\n\nBraun isn\u2019t alone in his approach to going above and beyond in the creation and execution of unforgettably luxe wine events, though. Whether it\u2019s a private events company or shop owner, a restaurant\u2019s in-house sommelier, or someone directly representing a winery or wine region, this is the new winning path toward creating meaningful engagement with wine consumers.\n\n\u201cThe moral of the story is that a wine dinner or a walk-around tasting is so 1995 and boring,\u201d says Belinda Chang, who puts on luxurious events of her own after decades spent working with top-level restaurant wine programs.\n\nInstead, Chang curates a lineup of events, including pre-prom, pool party, and picnic themes, tied to bigger outings such as the Food & Wine Classic in Aspen and the James Beard Awards (Chang won the 2011 Outstanding Wine Service award) while also collaborating with top producers to score exclusive pours and big-name attendees.\n\nThis type of bespoke service for high-end consumers and clientele represents the next level of wine events. Anybody can host a tasting or a seminar\u2014not everybody can do it like this.\n\nA exclusive wine event in Kauai, Hawaii. Keani Andrade Photography\n\nStoking Wine Culture\n\nSuch events are particularly key for areas not known for their wine culture. You don\u2019t need to try very hard to find thoughtful wine events or knowledgeable sommeliers and hosts in 2019 Napa Valley.\n\nOn Kauai, in addition to running his wine shop and curating the staggering private collections of his clientele, that\u2019s part of the reason why Braun also now serves as the Bailli, or president, of the Kauai chapter of Cha\u00eene des R\u00f4tisseurs. The ancient gastronomic society, which has roots reaching back to 13th century France, was revived in 1950 and now has outposts in 80 countries.\n\nThere\u2019s only so many high-end restaurants and venues on Kauai, so putting on a quality wine-centric event often means starting from scratch. \u201cSometimes you\u2019re inventing the wheel and coming up with new experiences, building them from the ground up,\u201d Braun says.\n\nThe very next evening after the private Casarena dinner, Braun leapt right back into the fire, or in this case the fire pit, of wine event planning with one of his half dozen annual Cha\u00eene des R\u00f4tisseurs events.\n\nBilled as a \u201cfarm and fire\u201d dinner, the event was hosted on the grounds of a small local farm, and showcased a chef preparing local Ni\u2019ihau lamb and a lavish spread of farm-fresh produce. To go along with the food, much of which was sourced on-site, Braun put together an assortment of 16 fine and rare French wines for sampling. He called it a \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d wine tasting, with hand-picked bottles matching the varied tastes of everyone in the crowd.\n\nSelf-declared wine mystic Daniel Braun. Keani Andrade Photography\n\nHis focus, as it usually is, was on Burgundy. \u201cI\u2019ve been able to carve a niche out in that area,\u201d Braun says. \u201cBurgundy is kind of my gem.\u201d And so it is that his little wine shop in Princeville, Kauai, routinely outsources shops in far larger and more accessible locales, pulling in hauls of the most coveted, in-demand bottles from the region\u2019s top producers.\n\n\u201cI want to stoke wine culture on Kauai,\u201d Braun says. It may not be the most typical place to expect it\u2014 mai tais and frozen drinks are what most tourists typically envision\u2014but when you speak with his clients, that\u2019s the refrain you'll continue to hear.\n\nOne collector, for whom Braun had just hand-delivered two cases of the 100-point Tenuta San Guido Sassicaia 2016, calls his shop \u201cthe gold standard, one of the best little wine stores I\u2019ve ever been to.\u201d\n\nEven within his own store, Braun has made an impact. \u201cIt\u2019s so cool to see the wine culture that\u2019s emerging on Kauai, thanks to a place like this,\u201d says Taylor Garcia, an employee at Braun's shop. \u201cThere's not a lot of job opportunities on the island where you can actually continue to learn.\u201d\n\nThe writer was a guest of the Princeville Wine Market.", "description": "Wine professionals are reinventing the tasting event", "authors": ["Jake Emen"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-106972/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
