Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) sent a fundraising email Tuesday evening in which she repeated a claim that she had been fired from her first teaching job for being \u201cvisibly pregnant.\u201d\n\nHowever, new evidence that has emerged in the past several days \u2014 from left-wing, right-wing, and mainstream media sources \u2014 has cast doubt on that claim.\n\nIn the subject line of her email, Warren claimed: \u201cBy June I was visibly pregnant \u2014 and the principal told me the job I\u2019d already been promised for the next year would go to someone else.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cMy story is not unique. And now, right-wing media outlets are dismissing my story \u2014 and in doing so, dismissing many similar stories of other women who have also been affected by pregnancy discrimination.\u201d\n\nThe implication was that the principal fired her because of her pregnancy. Warren has repeated the same story on the campaign trail and the debate stage for several months.\n\nHowever, in a video interview from 2007 highlighted by Jacobin writer (and Democratic Socialists of America member) Meagan Day last Tuesday, Warren said that she chose to leave her job after her first year because she lacked the necessary qualifications and decided, while pursuing the necessary graduate level education courses, that she did not want to continue.\n\n\u201cI actually didn\u2019t have the education courses, so I was on an \u2019emergency certificate,\u2019 it was called,\u201d Warren recalled. \u201cAnd I went back to graduate school, and took a couple of courses in education, and said, \u2018I don\u2019t think this is going to work out for me.\u2019\u201d She then added: \u201cAnd I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby, and I stayed home for a couple of years.\u201d Warren never mentioned anything about being fired.\n\nOn Monday, the Washington Free Beacon published notes from county school board meetings showing that Warren\u2019s contract had been renewed unanimously for a second year, but that she chose to resign \u2014 a decision the board accepted \u201cwith regret.\u201d\n\nLate Monday evening, CBS News published a story in which Warren stuck to her story about being let go for being pregnant, saying she had only opened up more fully about her life when entering politics.\n\nThe mainstream news network also found contemporaneous newspaper accounts from 1971 that reported Warren had left her job voluntarily.\n\nIn her fundraising email, Warren cited one of two teachers quoted in the CBS News story, who said: \u201cThe rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant. Now, if you didn\u2019t tell anybody you were pregnant, and they didn\u2019t know, you could fudge it and try to stay on a little bit longer. But they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant.\u201d\n\nShe left out that the teachers also told CBS News that they \u201cdon\u2019t remember anyone being explicitly fired due to pregnancy during their time at the school.\u201d\n\nWarren, who raised nearly $25 million in the third quarter, trailing only Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) among Democratic presidential candidates, has used this fundraising tactic before.\n\nIn November 2017, she raised cash off President Donald Trump calling her \u201cPocahontas,\u201d referring to her false claims of Native American ancestry.\n\nBy 2019, she had to apologize.\n\nJoel B.
