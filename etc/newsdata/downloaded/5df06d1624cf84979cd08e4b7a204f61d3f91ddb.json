But the French president changed his mind after a weekend of telephone diplomacy.\n\nStrong indications from the U.K. that it will hold an early general election and assurances that London won\u2019t seek another renegotiation of the Withdrawal Agreement, as well as a commitment that the EU27 could start working on the new European Commission\u2019s strategic agenda without the U.K.'s participation, saw Macron agree to the longer extension, according to the French official. The Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party have reportedly pledged to back a U.K. general election in early December if the EU granted a three-month extension.\n\n\u201cThe perspective of elections [in the U.K.] was clearly reinforced over the weekend, several parties support it in principle, including the Lib Dems and SNP,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe conditions of the extension were reinforced and clarified, namely the non-negotiable nature of the [Withdrawal] Agreement and the possibility of conducting meetings about European business among the [EU] 27 alone [without the U.K.] to prepare for the future.\u201d\n\nUnlike the uncompromising stance Macron took at the last European Council meeting when he stood virtually alone against opening EU accession talks with North Macedonia and Albania, France decided not to be the lone voice against the European consensus on the Brexit extension, avoiding taking sole responsibility for a no-deal situation that would have dire consequences for the Continent.\n\n\u201cAfter pushing for a very firm position, we wanted to prioritize unity and compromise instead of a solution that blocks everything or causes rifts,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe draft documents seen by POLITICO also show that, if there is full consensus among EU countries, the Brexit extension will be granted without the need for an extraordinary summit of national leaders, using so-called written procedure.\n\nJacopo Barigazzi reported from Brussels.", "description": "EU ambassadors will meet again Monday morning.", "authors": ["Rym Momtaz", "Jacopo Barigazzi"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1182737944-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
