It\u2019s important to understand that this assault on the Justice is part of the left\u2019s larger campaign against the legitimacy of the current Supreme Court and an independent judiciary.\n\nBy now readers have seen Democrats running for President calling for Justice Kavanaugh to be impeached, including Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Beto O\u2019Rourke. These Democrats know there is zero chance of a Republican Senate voting to remove Mr. Kavanaugh from office.\n\nThe attacks on Justice Kavanaugh are an attempt at intimidation to influence his opinions. But if Democrats fail in that, they want to portray conservative opinions of the current Court as illegitimate. Even Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota now says the Judiciary confirmation of Justice Kavanaugh was \u201ca sham.\u201d She knows better but so much for her self-styling as a \u201cmoderate.\u201d\n\n***\n\nFirst a word about the latest smear. The allegations against Justice Kavanaugh arrived in a New York Times piece based on a forthcoming book. The news\u2014this is a generous term\u2014is about a lawyer named Max Stier who allegedly may have seen Justice Kavanaugh expose himself to a woman at a party while a student at Yale.\n\nExcept Mr. Stier wouldn\u2019t speak publicly. An editors\u2019 note appended after publication adds the previously omitted detail that the woman involved \u201cdeclined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident.\u201d Oh.\n\nThe rest is largely a rehash of allegations from Deborah Ramirez, the subject of a New Yorker story during Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation ordeal last year. The point is to insinuate that Ms. Ramirez\u2019s accusations were credible and not thoroughly investigated. This is a brazen rewriting of history.\n\nCheck out the 414-page report on the various allegations against Justice Kavanaugh by the Senate Judiciary Committee, then led by GOP Senator Chuck Grassley. The committee notes it contacted Ms. Ramirez\u2019s legal team hours after the story broke. Ms. Ramirez\u2019s attorney refused seven requests to provide supporting material.\n\n\u201cDespite the refusal of Ramirez\u2019s legal team to assist the Committee in its investigation,\u201d the Senate report notes, \u201cCommittee investigators attempted to investigate her claims to the greatest extent possible, and interviewed seven witnesses regarding the allegation.\u201d In the end, the committee found \u201cno verifiable evidence to support Ramirez\u2019s allegations.\u201d\n\nThe Times piece laments that the FBI in a supplemental background check didn\u2019t interview a list of individuals supplied by Ms. Ramirez\u2019s legal team who \u201cmay\u201d have had corroborating evidence. But the FBI interviewed Ms. Ramirez, two alleged eyewitnesses and a friend of Ms. Ramirez\u2019s from college, and also turned up no substantiating evidence. A third alleged eyewitness declined an interview.\n\n***\n\nThis episode is part of the campaign that Democrats are running against the High Court now that it may have (we don\u2019t yet really know) a center-right majority. This includes regular campaigns lecturing Chief Justice John Roberts about \u201clegitimacy\u201d whenever a case with political implications is heard.\n\nWe\u2019ve reported on Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse \u2019s attempts to tar amicus briefs from sources he doesn\u2019t like. Mr. Whitehouse and other Democrats recently filed an amicus brief threatening the Court with legislative changes if the Justices don\u2019t follow their orders in a gun-control case. Presidential candidates vow to pack the Court with more Justices if they take power.\n\nThis is the most radical attack on the judiciary in decades. These aren\u2019t crank voices like those posting \u201cImpeach Earl Warren \u201d billboards in the 1950s. This campaign is led by the power center of the Democratic Party, including Members of the Judiciary Committee such as Ms. Harris who vet judicial nominations. Their attack on a core democratic institution is exactly what they claim President Trump is doing, but Mr. Trump is mostly bluster.\n\nThis assault on the judiciary is being carried out with conviction and malice, as the character assassination against Justice Kavanaugh shows. One motivation is that everything on the left\u2019s new agenda, from the Green New Deal to a wealth tax, depends on favorable court rulings. The left is used to running the nation\u2019s law schools and controlling the courts.\n\nBut the Senate has confirmed more than 150 judicial nominees since President Trump took office. And progressives would now rather attempt a hostile takeover of Article III courts than wait to win the old-fashioned way: at the ballot box.\n\nThe partisan relitigation of Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation is an embarrassment to the country, but it is useful in putting the 2020 election stakes in sharp relief. The future of the Supreme Court is on the ballot in Senate races as much as in the presidential race.", "description": "The revival of smears against Kavanaugh is part of a campaign.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107613/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
