On Friday, Trump denied any quid pro quo, but the texts suggest otherwise.\n\nBelow, we annotated the behind-the-scenes negotiations led by Trump\u2019s top Ukraine diplomats that have now become the latest exhibit in the House\u2019s investigation:\n\nVolker\n\n4:48 PM July 19\n\nMr Mayor \u2014 really enjoyed breakfast this morning. As discussed, connecting you here with Andrey Yermak, who is very close to President Zelensky. I suggest we schedule a call together on Monday \u2014 maybe 10am or 11am Washington time? Kurt\n\n\n\n\n\nSix days before Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky, Volker introduced Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to a top Zelensky aide named Andrey Yermak. By that point, Giuliani had been loudly advertising his belief, for months, that Ukraine should investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter for alleged corruption. Volker reportedly testified during his congressional deposition that he had tried to convince Giuliani that the Biden information he was receiving was unreliable. But Volker established the Giuliani-Yermak link anyway, and facilitated it through phone calls and, ultimately, an in-person meeting.\n\nVolker\n\n4:49 PM July 19\n\nCan we three do a call tomorrow\u2014say noon WASHINGTON?\n\n\n\nSondland\n\n6:50 PM July 19\n\nLooks like Potus call tomorrow. I spike [sic] directly to Zelensky and gave him a full briefing. He's got it.\n\n\n\nSondland\n\n6:52 PM July 19\n\nSure!\n\n\n\nVolker\n\n7:01 PM July 19\n\nGood. Had breakfast with Rudy this morning\u2014teeing up call w Yermak Monday. Must have helped. Most impt is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation\u2014and address any specific personnel issues\u2014if there are any.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat same day, Volker circles back with the other diplomats and offers the first indication that he understands that a good relationship between Trump and Zelensky is predicated on \u201can investigation,\u201d as Giuliani had been demanding. \u201cPersonnel issues\u201d likely refers to who Zelensky will choose as the country\u2019s top prosecutor\u2014an important issue for Trump and Giuliani, who want Ukraine to reopen an investigation into the Bidens and examine any role Ukraine may have played to help Democrats in the 2016 election.\n\nTaylor\n\n1:45 AM July 21\n\nGordon, one thing Kurt and I talked about yesterday was Sasha Danyliuk's point that President Zelenskyy is sensitive about Ukraine being taken seriously, not merely as an instrument in Washington domestic, reelection politics.\n\n\n\nSondland\n\n4:45 AM July 21\n\nAbsolutely, but we need to get the conversation started and the relationship built, irrespective of the pretext. I am worried about the alternative.\n\n\n\nTaylor, a career diplomat who served as the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine from 2006-2009 and was appointed interim charg\u00e9 d'affaires for Ukraine in June 2019\u2014following then-ambassador Masha Yovanovitch\u2019s sudden recall from Kiev\u2014establishes himself here as the skeptic of the bunch, Notably, he puts in writing for the first time the possibility that Ukraine is being used as an instrument for \u201creelection politics.\u201d Sondland\u2019s response suggests that the foundation of a Trump-Zelensky \u201crelationship\u201d is Ukraine\u2019s commitment to pursuing the investigations Trump and Giuliani want.\n\nVolker\n\n4:27 PM July 22\n\nOrchestrated a great phone call w Rudy and Yermak. They are going to get together when Rudy goes to Madrid in a couple of weeks.\n\n\n\nVolker\n\n4:28 PM July 22\n\nIn the meantime Rudy is now advocating for phone call.\n\n\n\nVolker\n\n4:28 PM July 22\n\nI have call into Fiona's replacement and will call Bolton if needed.\n\n\n\nVolker\n\n4:28 PM July 22\n\nBut I can tell Bolton and you can tell Mick that Rudy agrees on a call if that helps.\n\n\n\nSondland\n\n4:30 PM July 22\n\nI talked to Tim Morrison Fiona's replacement. He is pushing but feel free as well.\n\n\n\nVolker here further advances the Giuliani-Yermak relationship, despite it being abundantly clear what Giuliani wanted: The former New York mayor tweeted, just one month prior, that Zelensky should investigate Biden and alleged Ukrainian meddling in 2016. Volker, Giuliani and Sondland are now pushing for a Trump-Zelensky call in lieu of an in-person meeting, presumably to establish the terms of their relationship as Sondland mentioned the day before. Fiona Hill, who served as Trump\u2019s top adviser on Russia, Ukraine, and the E.U. until June, had been urging the White House to delay a phone call or meeting between Trump and Zelensky as much as possible, according to a former NSC official. But her replacement, Tim Morrison, appears to have been more receptive to the idea.\n\nVolker\n\n8:36 AM July 25\n\nGood lunch \u2014 thanks. Heard from White House\u2014Assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate/\"get to the bottom of what happened\" in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington. Good luck! See you tomorrow- kurt.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a key exchange that Democrats are likely to present as further evidence of a direct quid pro quo between Trump and Zelensky. Volker, just hours before Trump and Zelensky speak on the phone, spells it out in black-and-white in a text message to Zelensky\u2019s top aide: The Ukrainian president must convince Trump he will investigate alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election before any Trump-Zelensky summit in Washington is set up.\n\nNote: Trump\u2019s belief that Ukraine meddled in 2016 revolves around a baseless conspiracy theory that the Russians did not hack the Democratic National Committee and that the Ukrainians have been hiding the DNC server that proves it. (The DNC sent images of its servers to the FBI, and they remain at DNC headquarters.) Giuliani has also alleged that Ukraine helped Democrats dig up dirt on Trump\u2019s campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was a top adviser to the exiled pro-Russian president of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych. But during his trial, Manafort\u2019s former deputy Rick Gates testified that his boss had indeed received millions in secret payments from various Ukrainian oligarchs on Yanukovych\u2019s behalf.\n\nYermak\n\n10:15 AM July 25\n\nPhone call went well. President Trump proposed to choose any convenient dates. President Zelenskiy chose 20,21,22 September for the White House Visit. Thank you again for your help! Please remind Mr. Mayor to share the Madrid's dates.\n\n\n\nVolker\n\n10:16 AM July 25\n\nGreat \u2014thanks and will do!\n\n\n\n\n\nBy saying the call went well, Yermak seems to be saying that Zelensky successfully convinced Trump that Ukraine will investigate Biden and the alleged Ukrainian interference. \u201cIn addition to that investigation, I guarantee as the president of Ukraine that all the investigations will be done openly and candidly,\u201d Zelensky told Trump, according to a rough transcript of the call. Trump had asked for the investigation as \u201ca favor\u201d after reminding Zelensky how much the U.S. supports Kiev both financially and politically.\n\nAfter Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son with the help of Attorney General Bill Barr, Zelensky reassured Trump he would select a new prosecutor general who is \u201c100% my person, my candidate,\u201d and he or she \u201cwill look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue.\u201d\n\nA brief explanation: Biden\u2019s son Hunter served on the board of directors of an oil and gas company, Burisma, that was investigated briefly by the chief Ukrainian prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2015. Giuliani and Trump have alleged that Biden, as vice president, urged Ukraine to fire Shokin because he was investigating Hunter\u2014but the probe had been dormant for a year by the time Biden, and the bulk of the international community, asked Ukraine to fire Shokin because he was seen as lax on corruption.\n\nSondland\n\n5:25 PM August 9\n\nMorrison ready to get dates as soon as Yermak confirms.\n\n\n\nVolker\n\n5:26 PM August 9\n\nExcellent!! How did you sway him? :)\n\nSondland\n\n5:47 PM August 9\n\nNot sure i did. I think potus really wants the deliverable\n\n\n\nVolker\n\n5:48 PM August 9\n\nBut does he know that?\n\n\n\nSondland\n\n5:48PM August 9\n\nYep\n\n\n\nSondland\n\n5:48 PM August 9\n\nClearly lots of convos going on\n\n\n\nVolker\n\n5:48 PM August 9\n\nOk\u2014then that's good it's coming from two separate sources\n\n\n\nSondland\n\n5:51 PM August 9\n\nTo avoid misunderstandings, might be helpful to ask Andrey for a draft statement (embargoed) so that we can see exactly what they propose to cover. Even though Ze does a live presser they can still summarize a brief statement. Thoughts?\n\n\n\nVolker\n\n5:51 August 9\n\nAgree!\n\n\n\nThis is an important exchange, in which Sondland reports that Tim Morrison, Fiona Hill\u2019s replacement, has agreed to set up a Trump-Zelensky meeting\u2014largely because Trump \u201creally wants the deliverable,\u201d presumably of Ukraine\u2019s promise to launch the requested investigations.\n\nBy this point, the Ukrainians were extremely eager to arrange a White House summit because of the legitimacy such a meeting would confer on the new president and the symbolic importance of showing Russia, Kiev\u2019s chief adversary, that the U.S. fully supports the new Ukrainian government. Sondland is indicating that dangling a date for the summit might spur the Ukrainians to take action sooner\u2014but the U.S. also wants an assurance of some kind beforehand in the form of a \u201cdraft statement\u201d that was first disclosed by the New York Times on Thursday night. The statement, which Zelensky does not appear to have ultimately given, would have committed Ukraine to conduct the investigations requested by Trump.\n\nVolker\n\n11:27 AM August 9\n\nHi Mr Mayor! Had a good chat with Yermak last night. He was pleased with your phone call. Mentioned Z making a statement. Can we all get on the phone to make sure I advise Z correctly as to what he should be saying? Want to make sure we get this done right. Thanks!\n\n\n\nSondland\n\nGood idea Kurt. I am on Pacific time.\n\n\n\nGiuliani\n\nYes can you call now going to Fundraiser at 12:30\n\n\n\nHere, again, Volker brings Giuliani into the mix for advice on drafting a public statement delivered by Zelensky that would commit him to investigating the Bidens and the alleged Ukrainian interference in 2016. Volker is apparently trying to orchestrate the exact set of circumstances under which Trump would agree to work with Zelensky\u2014on the one hand, doing his job to facilitate a better U.S.-Ukraine relationship, but on the other, allowing that relationship to be predicated on Trump\u2019s personal political desires. Notably, this seems to confirm the whistleblower\u2019s description in their complaint that Volker and Sondland \"provided advice to the Ukrainian leadership about how to 'navigate' the demands that the president made.\"\n\nYermak\n\n4:56 PM August 10\n\nHi Kurt. Please let me know when you can talk. I think it's possible to make this declaration and mention all these things. Which we discussed yesterday. But it will be logic to do after we receive a confirmation of date. We inform about date of visit and about our expectations and our guarantees for future visit. Let discuss it\n\n\n\nVolker\n\n5:01 PM August 10\n\nOk! It's late for you\u2014why don't we talk in my morning, your afternoon tomorrow? Say 10am/5pm?\n\n\n\nVolker\n\n5:02 PM August 10\n\nI agree with your approach. Let's iron out statement and use that to get date and then PreZ can go forward with it?\n\n\n\nYermak\n\n5:26 PM August 10\n\nOk\n\n\n\nVolker\n\n5:38 PM August 10\n\nGreat. Gordon is available to join as well\n\n\n\nYermak\n\n5:41 PM August 10\n\nExcellent\n\n\n\nYermak\n\n5:42 PM August 10\n\nOnce we have a date, will call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of US-UKRAINE relationship, including among other things Burisma and election meddling in investigations\n\n\n\nVolker\n\n5:42 PM August 10\n\nSounds great!\n\n\n\n\n\nYermak gets assertive and plays a little hardball here, asking Volker to lock in a date for a Trump-Zelensky summit before Zelensky agrees to release a statement committing to any investigations. Volker tries to negotiate and offers a middle ground: show us the draft statement and we\u2019ll use that as leverage with the president to set a date. Yermak then explicitly spells out the plan for the first time: After a date for a summit is set, Zelensky will hold a press conference announcing the visit to Washington and committing to an examination of both Burisma and election meddling as part of a \u201creboot\u201d of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship. Volker, rather than express trepidation about this plan, says it \u201csounds great.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, on August 12, a whistleblower filed a formal complaint with the Intelligence Community Inspector General alleging that \u201cthe President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election. This interference includes, among other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the President\u2019s main domestic political rivals.\u201d\n\nVolker\n\n10:26 AM August 13\n\nSpecial attention should be paid to the problem of interference in the political processes of the United States especially with the alleged involvement of some Ukrainian politicians. I want to declare that this is unacceptable. We intend to initiate and complete a transparent and unbiased investigation of all available facts and episodes, including those involving Burisma and the 2016 U.S. elections, which in turn will prevent the recurrence of this problem in the future.\n\n\n\nSondland\n\n10:27 AM August 13\n\nPerfect. Lets send to Andrey after our call\n\n\n\nHere, Volker sends Sondland some of the language he would like to see in the statement released by Zelensky\u2014note: it includes specific references to both Burisma, the company that included Hunter Biden on its board of directors, and \u201cinterference\u201d in the 2016 election,and a promise not only to examine the episodes, but to actually \u201cinitiate and complete\u201d a full investigation. Sondland agrees and suggests they send it directly to Yermak, presumably to relay to Zelensky.\n\nSondland\n\n3:06 PM August 17\n\nDo we still want Ze to give us an unequivocal draft with 2016 and Boresma?\n\n\n\nVolker\n\n4:34 PM August 17\n\nThat's the clear message so far...\n\n\n\nVolker\n\n4:34 PM August 17\n\nI'm hoping we can put something out there that causes him to respond with that\n\n\n\nSondland\n\n4:41 PM August 17\n\nUnless you think otherwise I will return Andreys call tomorrow and suggest the send us a clean draft.\n\n\n\nVolker reiterates that the \u201cclear message\u201d being sent to Zelensky is that the diplomats want \u201can unequivocal draft\u201d that specifically mentions investigating both 2016 election interference and Burisma\u2014again, the company associated with Hunter Biden.\n\nYermak\n\n2:28 AM August 29\n\nNeed to talk with you\n\n\n\nYermak\n\n3:06 AM August 29\n\nTrump holds up Ukraine military aid meant to confront Russia\n\n\n\nVolker\n\n6:55 AM August 29\n\nHi Andrey \u2014 absolutely. When is good for you?\n\n\n\n\n\nTrouble ahead for Volker as it becomes public from POLITICO reporting that Trump ordered his national security team to put a hold on military assistance aid to Ukraine. Up until this point, the Ukrainians evidently believed that the only thing being held over their head by the Trump administration, in exchange for a commitment to probing Burisma and 2016 interference, was a summit with Trump at the White House. As it turns out, financial assistance that Ukraine has used to fend off Russian aggression in the east was also frozen while the talks were ongoing.\n\nTaylor\n\n12:14 AM August 30\n\nTrip canceled\n\n\n\nVolker\n\n12:16 AM August 30\n\nHope VPOTUS keeps the bilat \u2014 and tees up WH visit...\n\n\n\nVolker\n\n12:16 AM August 30\n\nAnd hope Gordon and Perry still going...\n\n\n\nSondland\n\n5:31 AM August 30\n\nI am going. Pompeo is speaking to Potus today to see if he can go.\n\n\n\nTaylor\n\n12:08 PM Sept 1\n\nAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\n\n\n\nSondland\n\n12:42 PM Sept 1\n\nCall me\n\n\n\n\n\nOne day after POLITICO revealed that military assistance aid was being withheld, Trump canceled his trip to Poland where he was expected to meet with Zelensky, citing a need to remain in the U.S. to monitor an impending hurricane. One day later, Taylor, who has already established himself as skeptical of the way the Zelensky-Trump relationship is being handled, asks Sondland a pointed question following revelations that the aid has been frozen: \u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d Sondland then suggests moving the conversation offline.\n\nSondland\n\n11:20 AM Sept 8\n\nGuys multiple convos with Ze, Potus. Lets talk\n\n\n\nTaylor\n\n11:21 AM Sept 8\n\nNow is fine with me\n\n\n\nVolker\n\n11:26 AM Sept 8\n\nTry again\u2014could not hear\n\n\n\nTaylor\n\n11:40 AM Sept 8\n\nGordon and I just spoke. I can brief you if you and Gordon didn't connect.\n\n\n\nTaylor\n\n12:37 PM Sept 8\n\nThe nightmare is they give the interview and don't get the security assistance. The Russians love it. (And I quit.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a particularly striking exchange\u2014Taylor seems to threaten to quit if Zelenky does the requested press interview and commits to the investigations, but Trump still holds up the security assistance. He also says the Russians will \u201clove it\u201d if that happens, indicating how important the aid is both symbolically and practically for Ukraine to fend off Russian aggression.\n\nTaylor\n\n12:31 AM Sept 9\n\nThe message to the Ukrainians (and Russians) we send with the decision on security assistance is key. With the hold, we have already shaken their faith in us. Thus my nightmare scenario.\n\n\n\nTaylor\n\n12:34 AM Sept 9\n\nCounting on you to be right about this interview, Gordon.\n\n\n\nSondland\n\n12:37 AM Sept 9\n\nBill, I never said I was \"right\". I said we are where we are and believe we have identified the best pathway forward. Let's hope it works.\n\n\n\nTaylor\n\n12:47 AM Sept 9\n\nAs I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\n\n\n\nSondland\n\n5:19 AM Sept 9\n\nI Believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The President has been clear no quid pro quo's of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign I suggest we stop the back and forth by text If you still have concerns I recommend you give Lisa Kenna or a call to discuss them directly. Thanks.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne day later, Taylor is still trying to convey how important the assistance aid is to the Ukrainians, and how the hold placed on the aid has \u201calready\u201d shaken their faith in the U.S. This further corroborates the idea that the Ukrainians didn\u2019t know this freeze on aid was even on the table. Sondland then indicates that the best way to restore the relationship and get Trump to release the security assistance is for Zelensky to go ahead with the interview\u2014again likely referring to a press interview in which he commits to the investigations.\n\nTaylor then responds with a comment that\u2019s been seen by Democrats as an elucidation of the exact quid-pro-quo disclosed by the whistleblower: \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d Sondland responds five hours later that there is no quid pro quo, and suggests \u201cwe stop the back and forth by text.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, on September 11, Trump released the hold on Pentagon and State Department aid. On Wednesday, the State Department approved a $39 million sale of additional Javelin anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, which Zelensky had specifically requested in his July 25 call with Trump. On Friday, Ukraine's prosecutor general, Ruslan Riaboshapka, announced that his office would conduct an audit of cases closed by his predecessors, of which there are 15 that deal with wealthy businessmen connected to Burisma. Notably, though, Riaboshapka did not commit to opening new investigations into Burisma itself or election interference directly.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/6b/70/190f6a0643d9b690be2ff86b2561/191004-text-convo-773.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
