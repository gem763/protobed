In an interview with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that aired Sunday, Little said of his victims: \u201cThey was broke and homeless and they walked right into my spider web.\u201d\n\nThe #FBI asks the public to help identify some of the victims of Samuel Little, a prolific serial killer who confessed to 93 murders. If you have information linked to Little's confessions, contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI (225-5324). https://t.co/RxXnJAIK2l \u2014 FBI (@FBI) October 7, 2019\n\nLittle began confessing to the murders in 2018 during conversations with Texas Ranger James Holland. Little was already behind bars at the time, having been convicted in 2014 for three murders.\n\nUntil his interactions with Holland, however, Little had maintained his innocence. But over the course of several months last year, Little confessed to Holland that he had killed 93 women across the country over the span of three decades.\n\nLittle\u2019s recall of the murders was \u201cphenomenal,\u201d Holland said, and the killer was able to create detailed portraits of dozens of his victims \u2015 drawings that law enforcement has used to close cold cases, some decades old.\n\nInvestigators discovered that Samuel Little likes to sketch. Ranger Holland gave him art supplies, and Little has drawn some of the 93 people he has confessed to murdering. The sketches helped identify some of his victims. https://t.co/UR9BkbgAx5 pic.twitter.com/BSlQaZ4MFU \u2014 60 Minutes (@60Minutes) October 6, 2019\n\nLittle is \u201cwicked smart\u201d and has a \u201cphotographic memory,\u201d Holland told \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, Little remembered unusual arches close to the spot where he killed a woman outside of Miami. Sure enough, when Miami detectives investigated, they saw the arches. Little had strangled Miriam Chapman near those arches in 1976,\u201d Holland said.\n\nThe ranger added that none of Little\u2019s confessions had \u201cbeen proven to be wrong or false. We\u2019ve been able to prove up almost everything he said.\u201d\n\nVideo footage released by the FBI this week shows Little \u2015 who has expressed no remorse for the slayings \u2015 speaking animatedly about his crimes. He speaks of the murders casually, often smiling and laughing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there was another person that did what I liked to do,\u201d Little told \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201cI think I\u2019m the only one in the world. That\u2019s not an honor. That\u2019s a curse.\u201d\n\nThe FBI said it\u2019s seeking the public\u2019s help in identifying Little\u2019s other victims and verifying his confessions.\n\n\u201cFor many years, Samuel Little believed he would not be caught because he thought no one was accounting for his victims,\u201d Christie Palazzolo, an FBI crime analyst, said in a statement. \u201cEven though he is already in prison, the FBI believes it is important to seek justice for each victim \u2014 to close every case possible.\u201d", "description": "Little has confessed to strangling 93 women.
