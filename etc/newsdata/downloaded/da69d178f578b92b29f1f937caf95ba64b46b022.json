I never had an official offer because everyone knew my idea to stay here.\n\n\"It was very difficult for me and my family because people don't know much about what's going on.

Each time it becomes clearer that my aim and that of my family is to finish [my career] here. First because of how I am at the club, how I feel at the club, and secondly, for my family.\n\n\"I have not spoken to [Bartomeu] since our Champions League elimination against Liverpool. But I have no problem with the president. I have never had any problems trying to sort out things with the club. On the contrary, it has been easy. Probably once it's done [the renewal], there will be no problems and it will be done in no time.\"", "description": "Lionel Messi says he wanted to get out of Spain altogether when he was investigated for tax fraud in the 2013-2014 season.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9ddde6122bd501e53683fa?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
