This is the hardest thing I've ever been through.\"\n\nIn an in-depth interview, the former Newcastle and Tottenham Hotspur star - who has a history of alcohol problems - revealed he had not drunk for six months as he prepared for and went through the trial process.\n\nInstead, he turned to exercise.\n\n\"I would be up all night doing sit-ups and squats or on the bike,\" he said. \"Anything to keep my mind busy.\n\n\"Those weeks before the trial were hard but I had to stay strong.\"\n\nGascoigne had been in a \"drunken state\" when he was arrested on 20 August last year, his trial at Teesside Crown Court was told.\n\nHe denied this, saying he had had pellets implanted in his stomach that made him sick if he drank spirits.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Gascoigne's drink problems are well documented\n\nHe told officers he had \"kissed a fat lass\" to give her a \"confidence boost\".\n\nIn court, Gascoigne said he had gone to reassure her after overhearing a man say: \"What do you want a photo of her for? She's fat and ugly.\"\n\nThe former midfielder, who won 57 England caps, was cleared of both sexual assault by touching and the lesser charge of assault by beating.\n\nHe told the Mirror he \"didn't mean anything sexual\" and suggested his fame contributed to the decision to prosecute.\n\n\"If it was anyone else this would never have gone to court. I accept I'm not liked by everyone,\" he said.\n\n\"I shouldn't have to change the way I behave. I've been kissed six times this morning - does that mean I have been sexually assaulted?\"", "description": "The ex-England footballer tells the Sunday Mirror of his relief at being cleared of sexual assault.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1494C/production/_109300348_gazza.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
