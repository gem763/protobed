This comment from his story today caught my eye:\n\nOn Capitol Hill, where Trump\u2019s fate may be decided, Pence is far more popular than the president. Doug Heye, a Republican strategist who worked for more than a decade in Congress, told me the lawmakers he\u2019s talked to are exhausted by the president\u2019s behavior. \u201cEverywhere they go, there\u2019s a mic in their face and a reporter saying, \u2018Defend what Trump just did,\u2019\u201d Heye said. If Pence ascended to the Oval Office, \u201cit would make the lives of every Republican member easier.\n\nBut even before the former Indiana governor assumed his current post, he had already fine-tuned the art of flattering Trump:\n\nCampaign operatives discovered that anytime Trump did something outrageous or embarrassing, they could count on Pence to clean it up. \u201cHe was our top surrogate by far,\u201d said one former senior adviser to Trump. \u201cHe was this mild-mannered, uber-Christian guy with a Midwestern accent telling voters, \u2018Trump is a good man; I know what\u2019s in his heart.\u2019 It was very convincing\u2014you wanted to trust him. You\u2019d be sitting there listening to him and thinking, Yeah, maybe Trump is a good man!\u201d\n\nRead McKay Coppins\u2019s definitive profile of the enigmatic vice president here.", "description": "Vice President Mike Pence has by all accounts been a dutiful Robin to President Trump\u2019s Batman.
