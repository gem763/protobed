South Africa was represented by Marcus Max Karsten, whose ambiguous tribal-inspired chest piece left locals scratching their heads.\n\nWhile many took to Twitter to express their confusion at his outfit, which one user labelled as a 'left-over Afropunk outfit...\n\nWhen will we stop being embarrassed as county? Who is this man, why is he wearing a left over afropunk outfit. He looks like he\u2019s from Benoni https://t.co/vpav2yEQeQ \u2014 Lily van der Woodsen (@tutuzondo) September 29, 2019\n\n... it was not the worst of the 36 participants.\n\nSouth Africans are forever scamming the world. ?? https://t.co/dg0UXzT6Os \u2014 The Nunukins Account (@tanyajunghans) September 29, 2019\n\nKeep scrolling to see our 25 favourite costumes from this year's entrants.\n\nOn September 26, the international male beauty pageant, Mister Global, took place.\n\nThe US was represented by Branden Cruz.\n\nMuch like Miss Universe, Mister Global has a national costume portion of the show.\n\nMister Nepal this year is Aryan Sitaula.\n\nIt's a time for each contestant, or \"Inspiring Gentleman,\" to showcase clothing that honours and celebrates their home country.\n\nManuel Duarte's costume was inspired by the ancient Mayan civilisation.\n\nOr to rock the colours of their country's flag.\n\nMister Cuba 2019 is Rubert Manuel Arias Soloz\u00e1bal. This was the first year Cuba was represented in the pageant.\n\nThe costumes range from simple...\n\nMister Sweden 2019 is Sebastian Jonsson.\n\n... To extremely ornate, like Guam's entry this year.\n\nAccording to Facebook, Jonny Onedera's look was inspired by the Guam kingfisher, a type of bird native to the island.\n\nJapan's contestant used a traditional parasol as part of his outfit.\n\nKodai Hata represented Japan this year at Mister Global.\n\nThe Swiss outfit looks like the robes that professional boxers wear before a fight, but featuring the Swiss flag.\n\nKenan Murseli, aka Mister Switzerland, was the third runner-up at the 2019 pageant.\n\nThis year's overall winner was South Korea's representative, 23-year-old Jong Woo Kim.\n\nKim is a police administration student and model, according to Missosology.\n\nAccording to the pageant's spokesperson, this year's pageant raised money for an organisation that takes care of elephants in Thailand, where Mister Global was held this year.\n\n\"We are true on our advocacy on Environmental Awareness and charity cause,\" spokesperson Kitti Kamjunsa told Bored Panda.\n\nThailand's costume was incredibly ornate.\n\nThailand is represented this year by Jeerawat Vatchasakol.\n\n\"The aim of Mister Global is to promote environmental awareness, and we have been promoting this cause ever since we started in 2014,\" said spokesperson Kitti Kamjunsa.\n\nThe winner automatically becomes a Global Goodwill Ambassador.\n\nMister Haiti 2019 is Tcholo Medastin.

His costume was another dragon-inspired ensemble.\n\nJust ask Mister Peru.\n\nMister Peru seems to be channeling the ancient Inca people, who lived in Peru through the late 1500s.\n\nThough some countries take a more laid-back approach, like Tunisia.\n\nHoussem Sa\u00efdi, Mister Tunisia, was close to taking home the Mister Global title.
