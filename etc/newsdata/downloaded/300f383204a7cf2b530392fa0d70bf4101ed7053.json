So Xander, who went as Rambo, starts fighting people in the streets, Willow, who went as a ghost, can walk through walls, people, random objects, etc. And Buffy, who decided to be an 18th century noblewoman, reaps absolutely no benefit. Classic. Chaos, of course, ensues.\n\nBoy Meets World \u201cAnd Then There Was Shawn\" Season 5\n\nThis is the most Halloween TV episode that is not actually a Halloween episode. The show aired in February, but it\u2019s got all the makings for spooky szn. \u201cAnd Then There Was Shawn\u201d takes place almost entirely inside Shawn\u2019s imagination, revealing that not only is he already the high school bad boy, his mind is also actually pretty dark. The students are trapped in the school, hiding from a masked murderer. One by one, each main character is killed. And there\u2019s a Jennifer Love Hewitt cameo because this show couldn\u2019t get any more 90s.\n\nSabrina the Teenage Witch \u201cThe Phantom Menace\u201d Season 4\n\nAll episodes of Sabrina are basically Halloween episodes, but the show still outdid itself every October. This time around, Sabrina decides she\u2019s over Halloween and chooses to work at the coffee shop instead. Of course, the Halloween spirits are not happy. It\u2019s basically illegal to ignore Halloween when you\u2019re a witch, for obvious reasons. So, zombies show up to teach her a lesson. Oh, and Edgar Allen Poe joins Hilda and Zelda for dinner.\n\nStranger Things \"Trick or Treat, Freak\" Season 2\n\nFirst, we find out that Will is somehow STILL connected to the Upside Down. Poor kid can\u2019t catch a break. And the episode does a good job of illustrating that bittersweet in-between stage: when you\u2019re probably a little too old to be trick-or-treating but you\u2019re not quite ready to give it up for the rest of your life. (But, hey, at least they\u2019re not in high school). Apparently no one has told the Hawkins kids about all the fun adult parties that will soon replace the bags of Reese\u2019s.\n\nFreaks and Geeks \u201cTricks and Treats\u201d\n\nWe were sadly only given one season of what should\u2019ve been a long-running coming-of-age series, but luckily one of those 18 episodes was Halloween themed. Sam, Bill, Neal and Harris refuse to give up trick-or-treating as high school students, and Lindsay ditches her mom to partake in illegal activities. Also, \u201cMonster Mash\u201d plays.\n\nParks and Recreation \u201cHalloween Surprise\u201d Season 5\n\nRon shows his softer side and takes Diane\u2019s daughters trick-or-treating. Donna live tweets \u201cDeath Canoe 4: Murder at Blood Lake\u201d (which should be an actual movie). And Jerry has a fart attack. Also, Ben proposes to Leslie, a perfect Halloween surprise.\n\nBrooklyn 99 \u201cHalloween\u201d Season 1\n\nSeason 1 started one of the greatest traditions in 99\u2019s history. Jake competes to be the Ultimate Detective\u2122 by trying to steal the Medal of Valour from Holt\u2019s office. Peralta, always schemin, dresses up as a janitor, gets Rosa to pick the lock to the safe and even pretends to climb up the side of the precinct with a blow torch.", "description": "From 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' to 'Stranger Things,' these shows will get you in the spooky spirit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d96025041b06d0009651262/lede/1570116274439-sabrina-the-teenage-witch-halloween.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.7853xh;0xw,0.075xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
