This government will not delay Brexit any further.\u201d\n\nOpposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said the party was eager for an election, but would not support Johnson\u2019s move to hold one until it was certain a delay to Brexit had been secured.\n\n\u201cAs keen as we are, we are not prepared to risk inflicting the disaster of no-deal on our communities,\u201d Corbyn said.\n\nBrexit, the United Kingdom\u2019s most significant geopolitical move in decades, remains in question more than three years since the 2016 referendum, with possible outcomes ranging from an exit on Oct. 31 without a withdrawal agreement to smooth the transition, to abandoning the whole endeavour.\n\nThe bill seeking to block a no-deal exit, passed into law on Monday when it received assent from Queen Elizabeth, will force Johnson to seek a three-month extension to the Oct. 31 deadline unless parliament has either approved a deal or consented by Oct. 19 to leave without one.\n\nResponding to concerns the government could ignore the legislation, Foreign Minister Dominic Raab earlier told parliament that the government would respect the rule of law but added, \u201cSometimes it can be more complex because there are conflicting laws or competing legal advice.\u201d\n\nJohnson took over as prime minister in July after his predecessor, Theresa May, failed to push the Withdrawal Agreement through parliament.\n\nParliament returned from its summer break last week, and Johnson has lost all six votes held in the House of Commons since. The suspension of parliament, or prorogation, will last for five weeks.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks ahead of the vote on whether to hold an early election, in Parliament in London, Britain, September 9, 2019, in this still image taken from Parliament TV footage. Parliament TV via REUTERS\n\nUnder Johnson\u2019s premiership, Britain\u2019s three-year Brexit crisis has stepped up a gear, leaving financial markets and businesses bewildered by an array of political decisions that diplomats compare to the style of U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nBlackRock, a U.S. investment firm that manages $6.8 trillion of assets, said a no-deal Brexit or a referendum had become more plausible.\n\nThe pound trimmed gains against the dollar GBP=D3, to stand slightly higher on Monday at $1.234. It jumped to a six-week high of $1.2385 in London trading after economic data beat forecasts.\n\nHOUSE OF BREXIT\n\nHouse of Commons Speaker John Bercow, champion of parliament in its move to rein in the prime minister over Brexit, took a veiled swipe at Johnson as he announced on Monday he would stand down from the role, issuing a warning to the government not to \u201cdegrade\u201d parliament.\n\nAs Bercow tried to suspend parliament on Monday night, well after midnight, a brief scuffle broke out near his chair as opposition lawmakers held up signs and booed.\n\n\u201cThis is not a normal prorogation,\u201d Bercow said. \u201cIt is not typical, it is not standard. It is one of the longest for decades and it represents not just in the minds of some colleagues but huge numbers of people outside, an act of executive fiat,\u201d he told a raucous chamber.\n\nJohnson, a former journalist who derided the EU and later became the face of the 2016 Vote Leave campaign, has repeatedly promised to deliver Brexit on Oct. 31.\n\nIreland told Johnson on Monday that he must make specific proposals on the future of the Irish border if there was to be any hope of averting a no-deal departure, saying Dublin could not rely on simple promises.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of agreed alternative arrangements, no backstop is no deal for us,\u201d Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, standing beside Johnson, told reporters.\n\n\u201cWe are open to alternatives, but they must be realistic ones, legally binding and workable, and we haven\u2019t received such proposals to date.\u201d\n\nVaradkar\u2019s blunt remarks indicate the difficulty of Johnson\u2019s gamble of using the threat of a no-deal exit to convince Germany and France that they must rewrite an exit pact struck last November.\n\n\u201cI want to find a deal, I want to get a deal,\u201d Johnson said in Dublin, adding that there was plenty of time to find one before the October EU summit.\n\nThe law that took effect on Monday does allow for one scenario in which a no-deal Brexit could take place on Oct. 31 - if parliament approved a no-deal exit by Oct. 19.\n\nSlideshow (17 Images)\n\nHowever the current parliament would be unlikely to switch stance and approve a no-deal exit by then.\n\nLawmakers voted 311 to 302 on Monday to demand the government publish documents over its planning for a no-deal Brexit and private communications from government officials involved in a decision to suspend parliament.\n\nThose calling for the documents to be published say they will show the decision to suspend parliament was politically motivated, as a way to limit discussion on Brexit. The government said the suspension was to give Johnson the chance to set out a new legislative agenda.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday he would not request an extension to Brexit, hours after a law came into force demanding that he delay Britain's departure from the European Union until 2020 unless he can strike a divorce deal.", "authors": ["William James", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1428117992&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881ZZ", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
