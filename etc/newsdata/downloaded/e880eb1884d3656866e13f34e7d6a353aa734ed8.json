But she's an amazing little fighter and I can't wait to see the personality she brings to our family.\"\n\nMrs Bender, whose pregnancy was high risk due to high blood pressure , was admitted to the hospital when an ultrasound revealed that Kallie was small.\n\nThere was a lack of fluid around the baby due to a condition called absent end diastolic flow.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nDoctors told the mum that Kallie had to be delivered prematurely to give her the best chance of survival.\n\nMrs Bender, from Gilbert, Arizona, said she was \"scared\", adding: \"It was so much fear of the unknown.\"\n\nWhen Kallie was born 15 weeks early she was immediately taken to NICU, where she relied on a machine to breathe for the first months of her life.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nShe was intubated and kept in an incubator while hooked up to machines.\n\nThe Benders remained by Kallie's side - speaking and reading to her, comforting her and cuddling her once it was safe to hold her, and playing music for her to help her development.\n\nDr Vinit Manuel, NICU medical director, had told the Benders, who have three sons, that Kallie's chances of survival didn't look good.\n\n(Image: Ebonie Bender)\n\nBut Kallie gradually improved and after 150 was finally healthy enough to go home.\n\nThe hospital said she didn't suffer brain bleeds or blindness, which are among the risks for babies born so small and so early.\n\nDr Manuel told reporters: \"There is something called a tiny baby registry and worldwide there are about 225 babies in that registry since 1936.\"\n\nMrs Bender said: \"I could not be more grateful for the doctors here and for our three primary nurses.\n\n\"They love Kallie and took such good care of her every day that they were here.\"", "description": "Premature baby Kallie Bender weighed less than a pound and doctors feared her odds of survival were very poor when she was born 15 weeks early in Phoenix, Arizona", "authors": ["Chris Kitching", "Image", "Ebonie Bender", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20670622.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Micro-preemie-baby-girl-who-weighed-no-more-than-a-soup-can-when-she-was-born-15-WEEKS-early-final.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
