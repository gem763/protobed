Check it out below, then subscribe to get future editions of Dollar Scholar every Wednesday.\n\nLike the rest of the internet, I\u2019m addicted to reading about the net worths of famous people. I don\u2019t have a good reason why. It\u2019s not as if knowing that Chrissy Teigen is worth precisely $26 million or that Sean Bean is the richest Game of Thrones actor is going to make me personally any wealthier \u2014 but I do it anyway. (In general, I do anything that lets me get all up in someone else\u2019s business. I am nosy.)\n\nI have wondered, though, about what my own green-and-teal Celebrity Net Worth page would look like. I hope they\u2019d use a cute photo of me \u2014 one where my hair looks shiny, obviously \u2014 and a gasp-worthy dollar figure. But I don\u2019t know the methodology behind it.\n\nHow do I figure out my net worth? What if it\u2019s low? Does the number even matter?\n\nI asked Northwestern Mutual expert financial advisor Tom Canale to give me a crash course. He explained that calculating my net worth shouldn\u2019t actually be that complicated. It\u2019s basically \u201c\u2018what I already own\u2019 vs. \u2018who I still owe,'\u201d Canale says.\n\nThe first step was to add up my assets, which according to Investopedia include investments, property, vehicles, jewelry, collectibles, et cetera. And if you\u2019re reading this thinking, \u201cUm, does Julia even have those?\u201d The answer is no.\n\nMy asset situation sucks, to put it lightly.\n\nI have a MacBook I bought for $1,500 in 2016, but the screen is cracked because I stepped on it (yep). I have an iPhone 7, but the battery is shot so I always have to keep it on low power mode. I don\u2019t have any precious gems, or a car, or a house. I guess I own an Avril Lavigne autograph that could be considered a collectible, but otherwise I don\u2019t have much worth much.\n\nThe second step in calculating my net worth was to add up my liabilities and subtract them from my assets. I\u2019m not going to bring you down by listing the specifics, but let\u2019s just say the end result was\u2026 not great.\n\nHowever, Canale told me not to agonize over it. He said net worth is often a negative number for young people, because they\u2019re investing in themselves by going to college, enrolling in graduate school or starting their careers.\n\nStatistics do show that Americans\u2019 net worth tends to grow over time. According to the Federal Reserve, the median net worth for people under 35 is $11,100. It ticks up to $59,800 for people between 35 and 44, reaches $124,200 for people between 45 and 54, and so on.\n\n\u201cRather than worry about your net worth, I believe you should make conscious decisions that can positively impact it,\u201d Canale adds.\n\nAmin Dabit, vice president of advisory service for Personal Capital, explained that the main way I can increase my net worth is by paying off my debt and examining my cash flow. Ideally, I want to be earning more money than I\u2019m spending. A \u201chealthy\u201d ratio of liabilities to assets is about 30%, he says, so like $1 in (good) debt for every $3 I have. My assets should also be generating income for me.\n\nDabit recommended I reassess my net worth every six months or so to make sure I\u2019m still on an upward trajectory. Personal Capital has an automatically updating net worth widget, whereas Charles Schwab has a printable worksheet I can use if pen and paper are my preference.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s healthy and important to know what your net worth is, but [don\u2019t] over-focus on that number,\u201d Dabit tells me. \u201cReally think through the dynamics of what\u2019s getting you to that number \u2026 and create steps so you can change it over time.\u201d\n\nBottom line: I can figure out my net worth by subtracting all of my liabilities from all of my assets, and I should do so a couple of times a year. But I shouldn\u2019t freak out if the number isn\u2019t to my liking right now.\n\nThough it does matter to lenders, \u201cyour net worth doesn\u2019t tell the entire story,\u201d as Canale says.", "description": "It'll matter to lenders.", "authors": ["Julia Glum"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tvRjOL_epWkh6HlKNehnKg--~B/aD0xOTIwO3c9Mjg4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/money_403/63335ed8b8534b0b157f40d43ab3b544", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
