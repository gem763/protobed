Not a lot of people know who I am off of it.\n\n\u201cMe being here ... you\u2019ll learn who I am more and kind of learn my personality a little bit, see the guy I am. I\u2019m very confident. I love the game of football. I love to have fun.\u201d\n\nRamsey, who joins former Jaguars teammates Blake Bortles and Dante Fowler in LA, is especially looking forward to joining the Rams\u2019 locker room.\n\n\u201cI heard the culture here is dope,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to be a part of it. I can\u2019t wait to be able to be myself on and off the field, and just help the organization in every way that I can.\u201d\n\nRams head coach Sean McVay echoed the sentiments.\n\n\u201cI think you want guys with some swag, some personality, different things like that,\u201d McVay said. \u201cAs long as those guys love football, they love competing every single day, I think usually this is a building that I think will suit him well.\u201d\n\nOPINION:Rams' trade for Jalen Ramsey feels desperate\n\nJALEN RAMSEY:Rams hope new cornerback can play Sunday vs. Falcons\n\nFOOTBALL FIX:NFL news and exclusive analysis delivered to your inbox\n\nRamsey played alongside Fowler on a defense that spurred the Jaguars to the 2017 AFC Championship Game, but he\u2019s familiar with a few of his other new teammates.\n\n\u201cI know Dante, of course,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cI know Aaron Donald is on this defense, the best player in the NFL. Eric Weddle is back there. I\u2019ve got to get to know the guys a little bit more, of course, just now getting here.\"\n\nHaving traveled all day on Wednesday from Florida, Ramsey wasn\u2019t sure if he would be able to take the field for the Rams on Sunday at Atlanta.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s smart for me to go out there on Sunday, then I will,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cI\u2019ve been missing football. I love football. So I would love that, but at the end of the day, we do have to be smart as well.\u201d\n\nRamsey was at home in Jacksonville when he received word that the Rams dealt cornerback Marcus Peters to Baltimore.\n\n\u201cOf course, my phone started blowing up when that happened,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cShortly after that, I got a call.\u201d\n\nJacksonville had traded the two-time Pro Bowler to Los Angeles for first-round picks in 2020 and 2021 and a fourth-rounder in 2021.\n\n\u201cI was overjoyed,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cI was super, super excited. A fresh start and a fresh start in a place like LA, with the culture that I\u2019ve heard about here. I\u2019m a young guy still, everybody around here is kind of young. I feel like it\u2019ll be a little bit more understanding.\u201d\n\nRamsey, who has nine interceptions and 45 pass breakups in 51 career games, had been inactive the last three games for Jacksonville with a back injury suffered after requesting a trade.\n\nRamsey said he wasn\u2019t \u201creally worried\u201d about a contract extension that was such a thorny issue with the Jaguars.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll happen in due time,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cI have full confidence in myself and my abilities. I think I\u2019ll continue to be the best corner in the league for years and years and years to come. So it\u2019ll handle itself.\u201d\n\nFollow the Ventura County Star's Joe Curley on Twitter @vcsjoecurley.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
