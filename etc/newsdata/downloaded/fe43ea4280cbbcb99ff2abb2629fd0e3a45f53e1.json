Big Tech has been fast-moving into the mobile video space for a few years now, and recently a slew of mobile-specific content has arrived.\n\nInstagram launched IGTV in 2018, and is pushing creators to explore what\u2019s possible for mobile video. Netflix introduced vertical 30-second previews, and is now experimenting with mobile-first features like vibrating movies. Spotify is releasing vertical music videos. Snap is delivering plenty of premium mobile video content with its Snap Originals, and has more on the way.\n\nBut compared to traditional videos which have been around since 1895, mobile video is still a newborn baby. And for new parents, a good way to learn parenting is to look at what others are doing. On that note, mobile video producers should direct their attention to a format Chinese media companies have been experimenting with: the vertical drama (\u7ad6\u5c4f\u5267; sh\u00f9p\u00edngj\u00f9).\n\niQiyi\u2019s Arg Director\n\nVertical dramas are what Chinese producers call their scripted content made especially for vertical mobile play. Chinese internet giant Tencent first dipped its toes into the vertical drama category in 2018, releasing short romcom series like My Boyfriend-ish Sister (\u6211\u7684\u7537\u53cb\u529b\u59d0\u59d0;W\u01d2 de n\u00e1ny\u01d2ul\u00ec ji\u011bji\u011b) and My Idiot Boyfriend (\u6211\u7684\u4e8c\u8d27\u7537\u53cb; W\u01d2 de \u00e8r hu\u00f2 n\u00e1ny\u01d2u).\n\nSoon after, iQiyi, a production company under the other Chinese giant Baidu, released the slice-of-life sitcom Ugh! Life! (\u751f\u6d3b\u5bf9\u6211\u4e0b\u624b\u4e86; Sh\u0113nghu\u00f3 du\u00ec w\u01d2 xi\u00e0sh\u01d2ule) in the same year. Its sister series Arg Director (\u5bfc\u6f14\u5bf9\u6211\u4e0b\u624b\u4e86; D\u01ceoy\u01cen du\u00ec w\u01d2 xi\u00e0sh\u01d2ule), a sketch comedy show exploring the genre tropes from Chinese TV, was released in 2019.\n\nSmaller players have also entered the vertical playing field with more modestly-scaled productions. A notable example is Mr Yan Dong! Don\u2019t Come Over (\u989c\u4e1c\u5148\u751f\u522b\u8fc7\u6765; Y\u00e1n d\u014dng xi\u0101nsh\u0113ng bi\u00e9 gu\u00f2l\u00e1i), a gay romantic series produced by Manman, an app dedicated to digital comicstrips. Popular video apps like Douyin (TikTok\u2019s Chinese version) and Kuaishou have begun curating professionally produced, scripted narrative content too.\n\nWhat\u2019s remarkable about vertical drama is that it\u2019s not just any scripted content cropped for a vertical aspect ratio. These shows are specifically imagined for the mobile screen from the ground up. This is evident in three features they all share.\n\niQiyi\u2019s Arg Director\n\n1. Super short episodes\n\nAn episode in a vertical drama is typically between two and five minutes. They\u2019re written to deliver each plot-point or punchline as quickly as possible. Before you know it, an episode of Arg Director delivers 10 jokes and then quickly ends, leaving you with an appetite for more.\n\nThis way, not only is a viewer much more likely to finish an episode, they\u2019re more likely to finish a whole season. With the bitesize episodes being snackable AND bingeable, vertical dramas lock in the viewer\u2018s attention with the same intensity as a tub of popcorn.\n\nIn the battle for mobile audience\u2018s fragmented attention, longform content can\u2019t compete: this is the Popcorn League (Note that as the vertical format requires you to hold the phone with one hand, it\u2019s taking one hand away from the actual popcorn, thus even winning half of THAT fight).\n\n2. Vertical is treated as a genre\n\nThe great majority of vertical dramas released so far have a comedic dimension. This is, of course, by design: comedy is a genre known for conveying gratification in short bursts, and comedies typically have an emphasis on actors\u2019 facial reactions. Both of these elements are a great fit for mobile.\n\nJust as television has properties that suit certain content better than feature films, so does vertical mobile video. Namely, the medium is good for a lot of intense, fast-paced, and personal moments. Specific narrative devices, such as characters\u2019 internal dialogues or a very abrupt turn of events, would be awkward and out of place when used excessively in longform storytelling.\n\nHowever, these devices are the typical narrative building blocks in iQiyi\u2019s sitcom Ugh Life!, where characters in everyday situations often find extraordinary things happening around them, such as time-traveling, mind-control, or extremely disappointing blind dates.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean the vertical mobile format is only fit for comedies, but rather that when Chinese producers ideated their vertical dramas, the medium\u2018s innate rhythm was accounted for.\n\nA pilot episode for the show \u201cCursed to be Single\u201d (\u5355\u8eab\u72d7\u7684\u8bc5\u5492; D\u0101nsh\u0113n g\u01d2u de z\u01d4zh\u00f2u)\n\n3. A fragmented visual language\n\nA combination of split screens, swipes, and quick cuts dominate the visual language of the vertical drama. This is, of course, a style appropriate for the short episodes and fast comedic rhythm of these shows. But it also allows each moment on screen to contain more information. While the vertical mobile video has very limited visual space for spatial context and mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, it compensates by literally pushing double or triple the amount of visual information into focus. This results in a visually fragmented viewing experience that is nonetheless fluid and dynamic.\n\nWe can also consider the mobile screen\u2018s form factor. The large film screen, through its overwhelming size, attempts to immerse the cinema-goer in another world. The mobile screen, which in this sense is the opposite of film, doesn\u2019t concern itself with immersion, but rather provides a tiny surreal portal into the universe of its content. It is this surreal distinction of the small mobile display from its real world surroundings that allows viewers to accept its supernatural visual language: faster, denser, and more information-rich than the real world can offer.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note these elements are not particular to a Chinese context, but rather they\u2019re particular to the vertical mobile format. If we look at the Snap Originals released recently, we can actually find traces of the same features too. Mobile video is a new medium, but video creatives on both sides of the planet are beginning to figure out the things that work.\n\nRead next: French government to create \u2018ICO white list\u2019 with new regulations", "description": "Vertical dramas are what Chinese producers call their scripted content made especially for vertical mobile play.
