Epstein was expected to meet the faculty and discuss ongoing projects for additional funding.\n\nAs the trip was being planned, director Joi Ito told former director of dev elopement and strategy Peter Cohen, that Epstein \"never goes into any without his two female 'assistants,'\" Swenson told The New Yorker. Swenson objected to the stipulation, but ultimately the decision was made to have the assistants wait outside the room.\n\n\"I don't think he should be on campus,\" Swenson said in the report. \"At that point it hit me: this pedophile is going to be in our office.\"\n\nSwenson said she was disturbed when Epstein and his entourage finally arrived.\n\n\"They were models,\" Swenson told The New Yorker. \"Eastern European, definitely.\"\n\nShe reportedly added that \"all of us women\" working in the lab \"made it a point to be super nice to them.\"\n\nThe situation was so uncomfortable that the women in the group \"literally had a conversation about how, on the off chance that they're not there by choice, we could maybe help them,\" Swenson said.\n\nEpstein personally donated roughly $800,000 (R11 million) to MIT, but worked as an intermediary between donors to secure at least $7.5 million (R111 million) for its lab, The New Yorker found. Epstein, who pleaded guilty to state counts of soliciting a minor for prostitution and soliciting prostitution in 2008, was disqualified to donate to the university.\n\nBut senior lab officials circumvented the blacklist by concealing his involvement in the donations. Using Epstein's initials, Ito and other lab staffers identified him in on calendars - whereas other names were fully spelled out.\n\n\"Make sure this gets accounted for as anonymous,\" Ito wrote to the Cohen in an email regarding a direct $100,000 (R1.4 million) donation from Epstein.\n\nLab staffers were so accustomed to Epstein's anonymity that Ito referred to him as \"he who must not be named,\"or \"Voldemort,\" in an apparent reference to the antagonist in the \"Harry Potter\" series.\n\nSwenson alleged in the report that the lab was fully aware of its tendency to conceal Epstein's ties to the university. She said that her experience, and her involvement, led her to feel guilty to this day.\n\n\"I was a participant in covering up for Epstein in 2014,\" Swenson reportedly said. \"Listening to what comments are coming out of the lab or MIT about the relationship - I just see exactly the same thing happening again.\"\n\nMIT president L. Rafael Reif offered an apology for accepting Epstein's donations and committed \"an amount equal to the funds MIT received from any Epstein foundation to an appropriate charity that benefits his victims or other victims of sexual abuse.\"\n\nIto apologised and said he would be returning an unspecified amount of the $1.2 million (R17 million) in private investment funds he received. Ito said he was also raising the same amount of Epstein's donations to the lab, and donating it to non profit group working to help sex trafficking victims.\n\nEpstein was charged with sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking in July, and had been held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. He pleaded not guilty to the charges and faced a maximum sentence of 45 years in prison.\n\nHe was found unresponsive in his cell in August, in an apparent suicide.", "description": "\"They were models,\" one former MIT Media Lab employee told The New Yorker. \"Eastern European, definitely.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7621/56f8dafacb6e47bfaec2b0c252f230cb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
