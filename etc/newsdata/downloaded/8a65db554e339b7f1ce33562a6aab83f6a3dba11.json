(Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s public call for the Chinese government to investigate a political rival could complicate next week\u2019s trade talks, which are set to resume Thursday when American and Chinese negotiators meet in Washington to see if they can find a path to a trade deal.\n\nExpectations that this round of talks could produce some type of an agreement have been rising amid growing evidence that the trade war is exacting an economic toll on both the United States and China. Chinese and U.S. officials had been separately charting paths toward easing trade tensions, potentially presaging an initial deal in which the United States agreed to roll back some of its tariffs in return for China strengthening its protections for intellectual property and purchasing American agriculture.\n\nBut the president\u2019s public urging of China on Thursday to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his family will only increase scrutiny of any agreement that Trump may reach with Beijing. Trump\u2019s request came just moments after the president discussed the upcoming trade talks and said that \u201cif they don\u2019t do what we want, we have tremendous power.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe events of the past 24 hours have made it even more difficult for Trump to come to any resolution or any trade deal with China, if it isn\u2019t an extraordinary series of concessions from China,\u201d Jude Blanchette, a China scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Friday.\n\nAt the negotiating table, officials are likely to still stick to trade issues when a high-level delegation comes to Washington starting Thursday.\n\nClete Willems, a partner at Akin Gump who served as a White House economic adviser until earlier this year, said he did not expect the president\u2019s comments on Biden to figure into the trade talks. \u201cOur teams have been very good throughout the negotiating process at keeping unrelated issues out of the talks, and I suspect that will continue,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the president\u2019s comments could change how a trade deal is viewed domestically, on both the right and the left.\n\nDerek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said Trump had just handed Democrats the \u201cperfect criticism\u201d about his trade deal \u2014 that he accepted a lukewarm deal because he wanted the Chinese to help him get dirt on his political enemies.\n\n\u201cPolitically, is making a deal a good idea for the president?\u201d Scissors asked. \u201cMy reaction is to what he did yesterday is, it just became a bad idea.\u201d\n\nA deteriorating situation in Hong Kong further complicates the appearance of striking a deal for the president, who might be criticized for entering into a pact with China at a moment when citizens in Hong Kong are under attack for trying to preserve their autonomy from Beijing.\n\nTrump defended his comments Friday, saying that striking a deal with China had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with whether the Chinese agreed to investigate the Bidens, and that he would like to strike a deal if the terms were right.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to do a great deal with China, but only if it\u2019s a great trade deal for this country. One thing has nothing to do with the other,\u201d the president said.\n\nMost Republicans have been silent on the president\u2019s statement, but several were outspokenly critical of the request, including Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah and Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska.\n\n\u201cIf the Biden kid broke laws by selling his name to Beijing, that\u2019s a matter for American courts, not communist tyrants running torture camps,\u201d Sasse said in a statement to The Omaha World-Herald.\n\nOther Republicans were more temperate. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said the president had publicly suggested soliciting political help from China merely to \u201cprovoke\u201d the media. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a real request,\u201d he said.\n\nThe setback comes at a time when Chinese and U.S. officials appeared to be making progress toward defusing, at least temporarily, a trade war that has been underway for more than a year.\n\nTrump and his advisers have begun looking for ways to find a compromise with China that would forestall another round of tariffs on Chinese goods that are scheduled for later this year, and perhaps roll back some of the existing tariffs, people with knowledge of the White House\u2019s strategy said. The United States has already placed tariffs on more than $360 billion of Chinese products. It plans to raise tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods to 30% on Oct. 15 and impose more levies in December.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's public call for the Chinese government to investigate a political rival could complicate next week's trade talks, which are set to resume Thursday when American and Chinese negotiators meet in Washington to see if they can find a path to a trade deal.Expectations", "authors": ["Ana Swanson", "Keith Bradsher"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NTRYeSugBuCqUpxIsbiP4A--~B/aD0zMjg1O3c9NDkyNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/efc85b6931c481db3e308a1a9f5d232c", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
