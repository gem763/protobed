His salary in 2016-17 was revealed to be between \u00a3600,000-\u00a3649,999, but he took a pay cut the following year, to \u00a3290,000-\u00a3294,999.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHis final programme included interviews with former prime ministers David Cameron and Tony Blair. Over the years Humphrys faced accusations of political bias, including by then-chief secretary to the treasury Jonathan Aitken, who in 1995 claimed he was \u201cpoisoning the well of political debate\u201d with his \u201cego-trip interviewing\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 29 TV shows that have been made into bad films Show all 29 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 29 TV shows that have been made into bad films 1/29 The A-Team Joe Carnahan\u2019s dusty and grimy adaptation retained the catchphrases and character personalities of the original series, while surrounding them with an entirely incoherent plot and noisy sub-Michael Bay action. Liam Neeson made for a fun Hannibal Smith and UFC fighter Quinton \u201cRampage\u201d Jackson did his best as BA Baracus, but a never-more-slappable Bradley Cooper and the chronically unappealing Sharlto Copley were the pits. 20th Century Fox 2/29 Aeon Flux A sad-all-round adaptation of the cult MTV animated series from the 1990s, Aeon Flux abandoned the avant-garde, largely dialogue-free sensuality of its source material for generic action and dodgy special effects. If it weren\u2019t for the classy presence of Charlize Theron and director Karyn Kusama, whose early cut was radically altered by producers, this would have basically been a bargain-bin Milla Jovovich joint. And that, honestly, would have been a lot more fun. Paramount Pictures 3/29 The Avengers Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman must have been grateful when Marvel came along and helped scrub 1998 film The Avengers even further out of cultural memory. But for those who had to endure their hammy 1998 adaptation of the classic spy series, it\u2019d take a lot more than Iron Man and Captain America to make us forget the image of Sean Connery inexplicably dressed in a giant bear costume and trying to control the weather. Shudders. Warner Bros 4/29 Bad Education Although The Bad Education Movie arrived in a similar summertime slot to the successful Inbetweeners film, this sitcom adaptation was nowhere near as popular. Jack Whitehall\u2019s performance was panned by critics who said he appeared \u201cdesperate to shock\u201d as delinquent teacher Alfie Wickers and described the whole movie as a \u201cfarce\u201d. Endemol UK 5/29 Are You Being Served? This 1977 film based on BBC sitcom Are You Being Served? took its inspiration from a theatre production in Blackpool. While it found success on stage, the big screen version was met with hostility, with one critic calling it \"guilty of violating almost every law of comedy and film\". EMI 6/29 Baywatch David Hasselhoff is unforgettable as the hunky chief lifeguard Mitch Buchannon patrolling a sunny beach in Baywatch. After a rocky start when the first season was cancelled on NBC, it became the world's most-watched TV show, running in its original format for 10 years until 1999. The unnecessary big-screen version of the show starred Dwayne Johnson in Hasselhoff\u2019s role and Zac Efron as a new recruit. Even the nostalgic cameo from the show's former star didn\u2019t make up for the paper-thin plot. Paramount Pictures 7/29 Bewitched Because nose-centric glory for Nicole Kidman couldn\u2019t happen twice, this adaptation of sparkly magical sitcom Bewitched arrived two years after the actor won her Oscar for The Hours, and promptly became a key component in her Queen of Flops reputation throughout the late-2000s. This had brilliance written all over it, from Nora Ephron behind the camera to Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman and Shirley MacLaine in the supporting cast, but still somehow managed to stink. Columbia Pictures 8/29 Keith Lemon Leigh Francis character Keith Lemon received the big screen treatment in 2012's Keith Lemon: The Film, one of the only titles to have ever received zero per cent on Rotten Tomatoes. Putting pins in one's eyes is rumoured to be a better experience. Lionsgate 9/29 Dad's Army Despite an all-star cast that included Bill Nighy, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Michael Gambon and Tony Jones, the poorly judged spin-off of the much-loved BBC sitcom Dad's Army (2016) took a pounding from critics, who derided the attempt at an homage to a TV show that had nothing wrong with it in the first place. Universal Pictures 10/29 Dark Shadows The nadir of Tim Burton\u2019s career, Dark Shadows was a film nobody was particularly crying out for, most of the fans of the original 1960s fantasy soap opera long dead and the general public having by then grown tired of Johnny Depp\u2019s \u201cheavily made-up comedy weirdo\u201d schtick. Most egregious, however, was the film\u2019s failure to properly utilise Michelle Pfeiffer 20 years after she played Catwoman in Burton\u2019s Batman Returns. Warner Bros Pictures 11/29 Downton Abbey Julian Fellowes took the beloved TV drama about the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family and the people who serve them \u2013 and turned it into one long fawning session about the royals. Absolutely nothing happens in this film where an entire sub-plot involves a boiler being fixed, and another, completely implausible storyline about an assassination attempt on the king. The only real intrigue is why Thomas, the butler, has suddenly acquired a very orange tan. This is what happens when British institutions get a Hollywood makeover, folks. Focus Features 12/29 The Dukes of Hazzard There was a time when Johnny Knoxville, Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson were the hottest cast in town. There was never a time this unwanted cinematic revival of the action comedy series wasn't entirely stupid. Warner Bros Pictures 13/29 Entourage Life imitated art when the main stars at the heart of HBO show Entourage hit the red carpet for the film version. Sadly, it lacked the vim that was present in most seasons of the show and ultimately felt like a mediocre feature-length episode. Warner Bros Pictures 14/29 Harry Enfield's Television Programme Kevin and Perry Go Large was no doubt adored by teens everywhere upon its released in 2000, which is why it's gained a cult following in the years since. In all honesty, the film is so terrible it's actually brilliant. Icon Film Distribution 15/29 The League of Gentlemen 2005 film The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse is proof that Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith, Mark Gatiss and Jeremy Dyson can do wrong. On the bright side, it's reassuring to know the multi-talented quartet are indeed human after all. United International Pictures 16/29 The Magic Roundabout It's not exactly clear who The Magic Roundabout film was intended for considering kids at the time would have had no idea who Dougal, Zebedee or company were. Save for providing work for Robbie Williams, Tom Baker and Bill Nighy, this version wasn\u2019t much use for anyone. Path\u00e9 Distribution 17/29 Mrs Brown's Boys We are all to blame for the abysmal Mrs Brown's Boys D'Movie. If the sitcom's Christmas specials weren't the most-watched episodes of television in the UK every year, then Brendan O'Carroll probably wouldn\u2019t have ever thought a film could be possible. Universal Pictures 18/29 The Office Ricky Gervais just couldn't stay away from his Office character David Brent and gave him the big screen treatment in 2016's Life on the Road. Every second paled in comparison to ever single episode of the classic BBC series. Entertainment One 19/29 Pok\u00e9mon The experience of watching the first ever Pok\u00e9mon film \u2013 titled Pok\u00e9mon: The First Movie \u2013 can be likened to watching a YouTube tutorial of someone playing a Pok\u00e9mon video game, only somehow more boring. Toho 20/29 Postman Pat The charming story of Postman Pat and his black and white cat in the fictional and busy village of Greendale first screened on the BBC in 1981. What a shame that Postman Pat: The Movie in 2014 \u2013 the 3D animated feature film version \u2013 managed to stray so far from its original simplicity. It sees Postman Pat (voiced by Stephen Mangan) enter an X-Factor style-singing contest, and despite featuring an impressive array of voice actors, including Rupert Grint, Jim Broadbent and David Tennant, the film was too scary for the under-fives \u2013 especially the scene that sees Pat turn into a sinister robot. Lionsgate 21/29 Sex and the City Sex and the City had all the ingredients for a great movie: starry cast, cult fanbase, glamorous setting. Alas, both films were an embarrassment to the original series. Not enough happened in the movies to warrant anything longer than a 30-minute episode and unfortunately we can never unsee Sarah Jessica Parker and co doing that bizarre slo-mo walk through the desert. Warner Bros Pictures 22/29 Spooks The problem with 2015 film Spooks: The Greater Good is that is arrived about 10 years too late. Spooks was a decent BBC drama that ended in 2011 and that's how it should have stayed. Entertainment One 23/29 SWAT Based on the 1975 series of the same name, this action crime thriller starred Samuel L Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, Jeremy Renner, and Colin Farrell in one of his early box office hits. There was plenty of high-octane drama and Farrell was convincing as a hot-shot cop taking on a French drug lord (Olivier Martinez), but it\u2019s also completely predictable and, ultimately, extremely pointless. Columbia Pictures 24/29 The Sweeney An updated version of BBC crime series The Sweeney starring Ray Winstone sounds like something from spoof heaven. The finished film, released in 2012, didn't really do much to convince anyone that it wasn't. Entertainment One 25/29 Thunderbirds Sure, Ben Kingsley as The Hood is a great spot of casting, but practically everything else in the film version of Gerry Anderson's Thunderbirds failed to make the grade. Anderson himself was most damning; he called it \"the biggest load of crap I have ever seen in my entire life.\" Universal Pictures 26/29 The Twilight Zone There are some interesting things in Twilight Zone: The Movie, but it loses points for featuring one of the worst pieces of work from Steven Spielberg: a segment set in a retirement home titled \"Kick the Can\". Warner Bros 27/29 Veronica Mars Just because the Veronica Mars cast and its loyal fans really wanted a movie spin-off to be made, it doesn\u2019t mean it should have ever actually happened. The TV show was revived thanks to funds raised by star Kristen Bell on Kickstarter, but the film was criticised for making literally no sense for anyone who hadn\u2019t watched the series. Warner Bros. Pictures 28/29 Wild Wild West Famously bad, Wild Wild West was adapted from the 1960s TV show and was the 2000 recipient of the golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture. Warner Bros Pictures 29/29 The X-Files You\u2019d have thought that taking The X-Files to the big screen, midway through the show\u2019s original run, would result in some major revelations about the show\u2019s oft-maligned alien mythology at its centre. Alas, it only opened up another barrel of questions to which series creator Chris Carter always struggled to answer. 20th Century Fox 1/29 The A-Team Joe Carnahan\u2019s dusty and grimy adaptation retained the catchphrases and character personalities of the original series, while surrounding them with an entirely incoherent plot and noisy sub-Michael Bay action.

Alas, it only opened up another barrel of questions to which series creator Chris Carter always struggled to answer. 20th Century Fox\n\nA BBC statement at the time defended Humphrys and said: \u201cViewers and listeners expect BBC interviews with politicians to be fair but also robust and testing. Day in and day out John Humphrys and his colleagues on the Today programme demonstrate with great professionalism how it is possible to achieve both those objectives.\n\n\u201cWe invariably take great care to investigate complaints from any party and we also have to be alert to the kind of pressures which in the past have tended to increase as a general election gets nearer.\u201d\n\nBBC director general Tony Hall said that public figures would breathe \u201ca sigh of relief\u201d at Humphrys\u2019 departure, in a piece for The Telegraph.\n\nDescribing him as \u201ca journalistic great\u201d, the director general wrote: \u201cHe is driven by a profound sense of justice and a deep distrust of authority. It means that he has always, unerringly, represented the listener and championed their right to know.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is perhaps no greater tribute than the collective sigh of relief issued by leaders and public figures all over the country,\u201d he added.\n\nAppearing on the Thought for the Day segment, rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks paid tribute to Humphrys, commenting: \u201cWe don\u2019t have prophets nowadays but if we did, one place you\u2019d probably find them would be the Today programme.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s tough interviewers are recognisably in that tradition of holding power accountable to truth... John Humphrys has been one of the best of our time. What\u2019s made John distinctive has been his fearless moral passion, and his refusal to be fobbed off with evasions and equivocations. He\u2019s been called \u2018radio\u2019s rottweiler\u2019 and the BBC\u2019s \u2018scrappy, scruffy mongrel terrier\u2019, chasing every rabbit, catching every ball, leaping on the grandest sofa with mud on his paws and a bark of amused defiance.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been called the listener\u2019s champion because he asked the questions we\u2019d like to ask but don\u2019t get the chance to. To do that for 32 years without loss of energy or integrity is quite something.\u201d\n\nIn a tribute in the Radio Times, Justin Webb wrote: \u201cThere are plenty who don\u2019t like him, who think he\u2019s gone on too long, who want him \u2018pensioned off\u2019 or \u2018put out of his misery\u2019 or whatever the phrase is they use to suggest that being a man in his 70s on air is somehow an affront.\n\n\u201cMost of these folks would see themselves as impeccable anti-sexists and anti-racists, but ageism is alive and well and apparently deeply acceptable in the anti-John movement.\u201d\n\nToday editor Sarah Sands revealed that Mr Cameron joked he was coming on Thursday\u2019s programme \u201cto make sure he got the old bugger out of the building\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t let go,\u201d Sands said of Humphrys on Radio 4\u2019s The Media Show. \u201cHe\u2019s a terrier, so I think you should expect something exciting.\u201d\n\nThe Today programme will continue with four main presenters \u2013 Justin Webb, Mishal Husain, Martha Kearney and Nick Robinson \u2013 rather than directly replacing Humphrys, who will continue to present Mastermind on BBC Two", "description": "John Humphrys\u00a0has hosted\u00a0his final edition of BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme after 32 years helming the show.\u00a0 The broadcaster\u2019s tenure has featured interviews with prime ministers Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair and Theresa May.", "authors": ["Roisin O'Connor"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/19/08/shutterstock-editorial-10106779a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
