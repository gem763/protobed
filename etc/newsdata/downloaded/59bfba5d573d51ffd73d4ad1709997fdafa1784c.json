All over the team, we were enthusiastic, energetic, in their faces. We've set our standard now and that's how we always need to play. Nothing less.'\n\nLascelles, who had issued an apology on behalf of the players after the Leicester game, said of Newcastle supporters: 'They travelled down there (to Leicester) to watch us play and we lost 5-0 so we do feel for the fans when things like that happen.\n\nA strike on his Premier League debut from 19-year-old Matty Longstaff won the game for NUFC\n\n'It's nice to bounce back and get a result for them. The atmosphere was great on Sunday, they were behind us for the whole game, and it makes a big difference when they do that. We're very thankful for that and we're just glad that we gave them three points.\n\n'We rolled our sleeves up and we got a big reaction. That's exactly what we needed, so it's been a really good week.'\n\nThe defender added: 'We'll enjoy this little international break and after that, we'll start planning for another big game at Chelsea (on October 19).\n\n'I think momentum is a big thing in football but I think a little break won't do us any harm and we can refresh but still knowing that we've just beaten Man U, and we're still on a high from that, so hopefully we can go into the Chelsea game full of confidence.'", "description": "A strike on his Premier League debut from 19-year-old Matty Longstaff, who was playing alongside his older brother Sean in midfield, secured what was just Newcastle's second win of the season.", "authors": ["Pa Sport Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/16/19499674-0-image-a-62_1570636420075.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
