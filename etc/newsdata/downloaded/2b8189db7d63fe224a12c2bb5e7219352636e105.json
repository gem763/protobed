No Matter What Tour, with work on their fourth studio album, Brother, already underway.\n\nAnd he and his partner, internet tycoon Andrew Cowles, had just arrived at their \u00a31million apartment in the upmarket Majorca resort of Port d'Andratx, for a month-long working holiday.\n\nOn the evening of Saturday, October 9, 2009, they finished decorating the flat ready for the arrival of friends and family and were looking forward to a quiet night in.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nSpeaking to The Mirror at the time, a neighbour recalled, \u201cI spoke to them on the Saturday evening and they said they were just going to chill out at home.\n\n\u201cStephen said he was tired and was on a health kick, so he was staying off alcohol during his holiday.\"\n\nBut something must have changed their minds and the couple instead headed for dinner and drinks in the nearby city of Palma.\n\nThe next afternoon, Stephen was found dead on the sofa.\n\nHe had suffered 'acute' pulmonary oedema - or fluid on the lungs - caused by an undiagnosed heart condition.\n\nThe pathology report confirmed his death was not related to drink or drugs and he'd been on good form in the days before, with his widower telling The Mirror, \u201cI do get some comfort from knowing how happy he was that day.\n\n\u201cThe night he died, we\u2019d had such a good time, a lovely evening in our favourite restaurant. He was the most happy and confident he\u2019d been in his life.\"\n\nWhile out, they met model and student Georgi Dochey in a bar and partied at the Black Cat club before the three of them headed back to Stephen and Andrew's place at around 5.30am.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThere, Georgie said they kissed before Stephen fell asleep on the sofa next to Andrew and he headed to a spare room.\n\nHe was woken by the doorbell at 8am but decided that as a guest, it wasn't his place to answer - a move that would torture him for years to come.\n\n\"I heard someone ringing constantly. I got up and looked into the living room and saw Stephen and Andy still lying there on the sofa and I just thought: \"It's not my house, I can't answer the door,'\" Georgi previously told the Daily Mail.\n\n\"I don't know if Stephen was already dead. I think about what might have happened if I had tried to wake him. Could he still be alive? It is really hard to think about things like that.\"\n\nGeorgi said he and Andrew were intimate in a bedroom hours later, and that it was only when he stopped to have a cigarette on his way out that he noticed Stephen hadn't moved from his 'curled up' position on the sofa.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"I went to take his pulse and couldn\u2019t find one. I knew\n\nhe was dead,\" he told The Sun in 2014, admitting he didn't know how to break the news to Andrew, who by that point was said to be sleeping in the couple's bedroom.\n\n\u201cI went into the bedroom and said, \u2018I\u2019m going. Let\u2019s wake Stephen up so I can say goodbye\u2019. Andy replied, \u2018No, leave him sleeping\u2019 and that\u2019s when I told him Stephen looked strange,\" he said.\n\nReliving the heartbreaking scenes as Andrew frantically tried to revive his husband, Georgi continued, \u201cAndy was whispering, \u2018Come on baby, wake up\u2019. He began slapping him round the face when he didn\u2019t respond.\n\n\u201cWhen he too realised he was dead, he broke down in tears. He then tried to revive him by giving him mouth-to-mouth but there was nothing either of\n\nus could do.\u201d\n\nStephen was pronounced dead at 2.25pm but had passed away in his sleep hours before.\n\n\u201cWe know from the pathologist\u2019s report that Stephen died sleeping with me on the sofa,\u201d devastated Andrew told The Mirror.\n\n\u201cI know that my boy fell asleep under my arm, his heart stopped, he didn\u2019t feel any pain.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBut in 2014, Stephen's family called for a fresh investigation into his death, which coroners ruled was due to natural causes.\n\n\u201cA few things about that night don\u2019t make sense,\" he told The Sun, questioning why Stephen fell asleep on the couch.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBut Andrew branded Tony's comments \u201cgroundless\u201d and said they had \u201cstirred up a lot of vileness\".\n\nHe said at the time: \u201cI\u2019m saddened that I\u2019m still dealing with the estate and unable to grieve privately.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s particularly difficult because I\u2019m the administrator of the estate and must remain impartial. Some of the insinuations are dreadful.\"", "description": "On the 10th anniversary of Boyzone singer Stephen Gately's death, we take a look back at the hours leading up to his heartbreaking death", "authors": ["Frances Kindon", "Image", "Getty Images", "Daily Mirror", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20539203.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Christopher-Biggins-60th-Birthday-Party-Arrivals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
