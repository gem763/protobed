Unlike [former] Vice President Biden, he made his point strongly,\u201d Jawando, who is now a council member in Montgomery County, Md., told Hill.TV on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI just think he might\u2019ve topped out,\u201d he added.\n\nJawando said Warren has started to broaden her base of support as she establishes herself as the new front-runner in the crowded Democratic primary race.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t know with the way the polls are moving,\u201d he told Hill.TV. \u201cA lot of that movement on the progressive side is going to Warren, so he\u2019s got to sort of stem that tide.\u201d\n\nJawando comments come amid Warren's continued rise in statewide and national polls in recent months, which had cut into Sanders\u2019 support among progressive voters.\n\nWarren\u2019s front-runner status was especially apparent during Tuesday night\u2019s debate when she became the target of attacks by rivals over her plan for universal health care.\n\nSeveral second-tier candidates sought to challenge Warren over Medicare for All, and whether taxes would go up under her plan. The Massachusetts senator fended off the attacks, while once again dodging questions over whether her health care plan would include a tax hike for middle class Americans.\n\nSanders also boasted a strong debate performance.\n\nThe veteran democratic socialist showed no signs of a lack of vigor, despite recently undergoing a heart procedure.\n\nHe later garnered even more attention off the debate stage after receiving major endorsements from two high-profile progressives.
