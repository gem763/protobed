But, of course, Ozil is a creator, a player with a lot of great quality that I like watching.\n\n\u2018This type of player, this pure No 10, is \u2026 how do you say? Extinct? Maybe not extinct, but not as used as before\n\n\u2018In the past, there was always this pure No 10, behind the striker or the two strikers, depending on the team.\n\n\u2018With different systems now, that position has evolved into a different one.\n\n\u2018But these are players I like, where natural talent brings the best of them and they can change a game with a pass or something that nobody else sees.\u2019\n\nMata is expected to start in United\u2019s mouth-watering clash against Liverpool on Sunday at the Theatre of Dreams. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is set to be without David De Gea and Paul Pogba, while Jesse Lingard and Anthony Martial face late fitness tests.
