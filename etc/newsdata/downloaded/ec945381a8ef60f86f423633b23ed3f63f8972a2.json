Biden.\n\nBut reports surfaced this week that the whistleblower reached out to a House Intelligence Committee aid before filing the compliant.\n\nThe committee aide then directed the whistleblower to Mr. Atkinson, which is standard protocol.\n\nMr. Schiff said he could not divulge Mr. Atkinson\u2019s testimony but lawmakers did discuss why he found the whistleblower to be credible and urgent.\n\n\u201cNow that we\u2019ve seen the call record, we can see that the IG\u2019s determination was correct,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
