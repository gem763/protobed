In 10 U.S. states, the number of Catholic hospitals is more than 30 percent.\n\nThe latest report updates a 2013 study and adjusts the methodology for what researchers consider a Catholic hospital, adding in facilities that were acquired by secular systems but still follow religious guidelines.\n\nMergerWatch's goal, according to the study, is to protect patient rights through hospital mergers, with help from the American Civil Liberties Union and a number of philanthropic groups. Many hospitals connected to the Catholic Church follow directives from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which bans contraceptive procedures or procedures to terminate pregnancy on religious grounds.\n\nThe report found that there are now 46 Catholic-restricted hospitals that are the \"sole community providers\" of short-term acute hospital care for people living in their geographic regions.\n\n\"In general, Catholic hospitals provide excellent care,\" Lois Uttley, director of MergerWatch and one of the report's authors told Reuters. \"Our concern is with these restrictions with reproductive healthcare.\"\n\nThese hospitals do vary in how closely they follow the Catholic directives. The ACLU has taken several Catholic health systems to court on behalf of patients, with mixed results, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nThe Catholic Hospital Association did not respond to the report findings, according to Reuters.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the study (.pdf)\n\n- read the Reuters article\n\n- view the ACLU's infographic\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCatholic-secular hospital mergers may restrict services\n\nACLU sues Michigan health system over denying emergency care to pregnant women\n\nBattle between Catholic hospitals and reproductive health intensifies\n\nRevised Catholic rule eases process for hospital mergers, affiliations\n\nPope Francis wants Catholic hospitals to increase care for poor", "description": "The number ofCatholic owned or affiliated hospitalshas grown by 22 percent since 2001, and now one in six acute care beds is in a hospital connected to the church, areportreleased by MergerWatch has found.", "authors": ["Paige Minemyer"], "top_image": "https://qtxasset.com/2016-09/hospital_campus_0.jpg?op5SJSdJwFm0zANFdteOMXUKUPg76o__", "published_at": "2016-09-21"}
