Despite receiving what ET described as \u201cby far, the lowest scores of the night\u201d \u2014 18/30 \u2014 the dancing duo did not find themselves in the bottom two, thanks to the weight of fan votes. It means that conservatives, as Spicer has mentioned on Breitbart News Sunday, are showing up and sending a message to Hollywood.\n\nViewers, particularly those on the left, were in disbelief.\n\n\u201cThe scariest thing about #DWTS is that Sean Spicer is still dancing,\u201d one user wrote.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening on dancing with the Stars??? GET RID OF SEAN!!! I\u2019m sick of him. Who\u2019s voting???\u201d another asked alongside the hashtag \u201c#notdancingwithtrump.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot believe Sean Spicer is still on Dancing with the Stars. I\u2019m livid. We have lost two great ones because people vote for this mediocre dancer. Come on America, do better,\u201d another tweeted, adding, \u201c#TeamAnyoneBesideSpicer.\u201d\n\nAcross the board, viewers were baffled by Spicer\u2019s grassroots support. Some even suggested removing the viewer vote and only allowing the \u201cpros\u201d to judge due to Spicer\u2019s continued stay.\n\nWhen is Dancing with the Stars going to ditch the viewers votes and allow only the pros to judge? Watching arrhythmic Spicer getting sent on each week while far better dancers go home is disgusting. Not sure how much longer I\u2019ll keep watching this charade. #DWTS \u2014 OKC News Insults Me (@OKCTVDummies) October 29, 2019\n\n#DWTS AM REALLY PISSED OFF. You need to change the rules with this voting situation. Sean Spicer can\u2019t dance and is constantly being saved while the good dancers gets eliminated. The same things transpired last season. The winner still can\u2019t dance. \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude08 \u2014 Sophia (@sophiapierre16) October 29, 2019\n\nThis is bullshit.

Don\u2019t let them on. Don\u2019t let them succeed,\u201d and then people vote. Because they don\u2019t get it. They don\u2019t understand where these votes coming from. \u201cWho are these people who don\u2019t agree with me or don\u2019t think like I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a great message to send. For all of those folks on the right \u2014 that we are equal participants and we cannot be canceled out,\u201d Spicer continued.\n\n\u201cHopefully this is helping the overall movement and people realize \u2014 hey look you\u2019re an advertiser, if you\u2019re a show, there are a lot of active folks on the right that you should be paying attention to,\u201d he added.\n\nBig conservative voices on Twitter also rallied for Spicer during the show.\n\n\u201cTeam Trump show up!!!\u201d Trump campaign\u2019s national press secretary Kayleigh McEnany wrote.\n\nEveryone, pick up your phone & vote for former @realDonaldTrump White House Press Secretary @seanspicer on Dancing with the Stars!
