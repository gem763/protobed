Ravikumar/Reuters P. Ravikumar/Reuters\n\nA 7-year-old boy had long complained of having a swollen and aching jaw. Surgeons at the Saveetha Dental College and Hospital in Chennai, India, operated and found 526 teeth crammed inside his mouth.\n\nThe boy had a \"well-defined bag-like mass\" extracted from his jaw, which weighed 7 ounces and contained hundreds of miniature teeth. Once it was removed, the medical team took five hours to meticulously search through and count all of them.\n\n\"It was reminiscent of pearls in an oyster,\" one doctor said.\n\nThe hospital statement did not release the child's name. He was discharged after three days.\n\nEach tooth, which varied in size from 1 mm to 15 mm, displayed a crown covered by enamel and with a rootlike structure, according to the hospital's statement.\n\n\"Though there is no problem in the growth of other teeth in the boy, the growth of molar teeth is permanently affected, and he requires molar implants after turning 16,\" The New Indian Express reported.\n\nThe procedure did not require jaw reconstruction.\n\nSurgeons said the lesion, known as compound odontoma, may be attributed to genetic or environmental factors.\n\nAccording to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, odontomas are usually discovered in people during their first two decades of life but can occur at any age.\n\nThe hospital asserts that it is \"the first ever case to be documented world wide, where so many minute teeth were found in a single individual.\"", "description": "The 7-year-old had long complained of pain and swelling in his jaw.
