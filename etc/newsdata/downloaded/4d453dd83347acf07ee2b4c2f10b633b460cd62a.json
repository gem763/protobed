Argentina trailed 20-3 at the break, led 21-20, conceded a dropped goal, and missed a last-gasp penalty after switching kickers.\n\n\u201cWe are still hurting after France, but it\u2019s in the past. The World Cup isn\u2019t over yet, and there are still three games ahead of us,\u201d center Jeronimo De La Fuente says. \u201cWe reminded ourselves that you will always be left behind if you stop believing. We are fully confident that we will show up against Tonga.\u201d\n\nThe players had better, because Argentina still has 2003 champion England to come.\n\nLedesma has handed Benjamin Urdapilleta his first start since June 2013 in place of Sanchez, whose kicking was off last weekend, and chosen Julian Montoya - a try-scorer against the French - instead of Creevy, the former captain.\n\nTonga also has to win after losing its opener to England 35-3 so Tomas Lezana - selected at No. 8 in one of four Pumas changes - knows what to expect.\n\n\u201cIt will be a crunch, without a question,\u201d Lezana says. \u201cTonga is a very physical team and we should keep to our set-pieces and redouble our efforts on defense as well as in the contact area.\u201d\n\nTonga coach Toutai Kefu must cope with Argentina\u2019s expected backlash without his most influential player.\n\nFlyhalf Kurt Morath might need throat surgery after trying to tackle England\u2019s imposing Manu Tuilagi, while center Nafi Tuitavake is also sidelined after breaking his arm in that game.\n\n\u201cWe are gutted for them, they are two of our better players,\u201d assistant coach Richard Watt says. \u201cKurt worked so hard to make it after coming out of international retirement and Nafi was only just back from injury.\u201d\n\nThe 34-year-old Morath is Tonga\u2019s all-time leading scorer at the World Cup with 73 points, and Tonga\u2019s all-time with 340 test points. He will be especially missed. He was impressive when the sides met at the World Cup four years ago, putting Tonga in the driving seat with an early try before the Tongans wilted in a 45-16 loss.\n\nMorath is replaced by the younger and bigger James Faiva, whose five caps have all come in the last two months.\n\nTonga\u2019s task is made harder by the fact it has had one day less than Argentina to prepare for the game at Hanazono Rugby Stadium, on the outskirts of highly popular tourist destination Osaka.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure our bodies and minds are fresh,\u201d Watt says. \u201cIt is a pretty quick turnaround for us and Argentina pose a similar physical challenge to England.\u201d\n\nThe Pumas are on the back foot in a tough-looking Pool C, but Watt expects them to be ready to handle the big-match pressure, simply because many of them are used to playing successfully for the Jaguares in Super Rugby and made the final this year for the first time.\n\nDefeat to Tonga on Saturday would almost certainly end Argentina\u2019s hopes of reaching the knockout stages, and make it 11 defeats in a row.\n\nWatt is not reading too much into that run of losses, however.\n\n\u201cThey have lost some games in the Rugby Championship, they were pretty close losses,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could have beaten the All Blacks.\u201d\n\nTonga\u2019s match against England wasn\u2019t close, but there were some signs of improvement in the wake of a humiliating 92-7 reverse to New Zealand in a pre-tournament warmup.\n\n\u201cIt was a better performance,\u201d flanker Sione Kalamafoni says. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t come here to be satisfied with just a better performance. We are here to complete the task of competing on a world stage.\u201d\n\nKalamafoni wants more audacity from Tonga\u2019s attack.\n\n\u201cWhen we got into the England 22 we didn\u2019t throw a punch,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to fix those little mistakes.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLineups:\n\nArgentina: Emiliano Boffelli, Mat\u00edas Moroni, Matias Orlando, Jeronimo De La Fuente, Santiago Carreras, Benjamin Urdapilleta, Tom\u00e1s Cubelli; Tomas Lezana, Marcos Kremer, Pablo Matera (captain), Tomas Lavanini, Guido Petti, Juan Figallo, Julian Montoya, Nahuel Tetaz Chaparro.
