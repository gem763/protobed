It should remain dry during the daylight hours, but the chance for showers increases at night. Highs climb well into the 60s, with lows Wednesday night in the 50s. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nOn Halloween, intermittent showers are likely. With winds from the south it\u2019s rather mild and a bit muggy, with highs up near 70. It probably won\u2019t rain the whole day, and we wouldn\u2019t yet give up on trick-or-treating as pauses in the rain are quite possible. That said, at some point Thursday night (possibly late at night), we could see showers and storms with heavy rain. Lows Thursday night are in the 50s. Confidence: Medium\n\nSome showers could linger early Friday but most of the day should end up dry, though quite windy. Clouds decrease, with highs near 65. Blustery Friday night with lows in the 40s. Confidence: Medium\n\nMostly sunny skies with diminishing winds over the weekend, but quite chilly. Highs are in the 50s, with cold overnight lows in the 30s, potentially dipping to below freezing in some of our colder spots Saturday night.
