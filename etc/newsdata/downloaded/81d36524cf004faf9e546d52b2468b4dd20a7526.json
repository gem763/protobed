He hammered her on the issue, and used it to define her with many voters. Clinton couldn\u2019t put it to rest early, and it dragged her down through the end.\n\nNow, Trump wants to use questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine, and any alleged involvement by his father, Joe Biden, as the 2020 sequel to the email servers. In both cases, he twists reality to make it seem like everyone\u2019s dirty.\n\nOnce again, Trump is trying to paint his opponent as shady, hoping it will be an early, definitional wound.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": ""}
