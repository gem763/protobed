(Ray Lehr via Twitter)\n\nTwo hours before Washington\u2019s first World Series at-bat in 86 years, a magnificent, extra-red rainbow spanned the sky. Many Washingtonians saw it as a good omen. And they were right, as the Nationals would go on to win Game 1 of the series against the Houston Astros, 5-4.\n\nThe rainbow formed as heavy showers zipped away to the northeast and the setting sun cast light from the west.\n\nSo besides the Nationals\u2019 pending victory, why else was Tuesday night\u2019s rainbow extra red? The light that produced the bow had to pass through more of the atmosphere because of the low sun angle. That scatters out much of the green and blue components of the light. It results in a preferentially red rainbow, similar to why sunrises and sunsets are red.\n\n\n\nA rainbow bends over the Capitol on Tuesday evening. (chasingmailboxes via Flickr)\n\nBaby sharks or baby rainbows?\n\nCrammed inside the primary bow, you may have noticed smaller \u201cmini rainbows.\u201d These are called supernumerary bows. They result from an interference pattern stemming from diffraction.\n\nWe know that raindrops refract, or bend light of different wavelengths (colors), differently. With light of the same color, that doesn\u2019t happen. But depending on where a ray of light enters the raindrop, it may have a greater path length inside the drop than another ray of the same frequency.\n\nAs a result, two waves of the same frequency may not be entirely \u201cin phase\u201d when they exit the drop, the crests and troughs of each wave either aligning or being misaligned. That results in one bright band of color where waves combine constructively, with bands of darkness where destructive interference occurs. With the right conditions, this process can have several iterations \u2014 resulting in additional and progressively dimmer bands of light/color. And more baby bows!\n\nThe most readily visible supernumerary bows occurred near the base of the primary bow last night, which is unusual. Ordinarily, any supernumerary effects are most pronounced at the top of the primary arc because of certain orientations of light/raindrops. That makes Tuesday night\u2019s display even more special.\n\n\n\nRainbow over the Washington Monument on Oct. 22. Notice the photo depicts nearly a perfect semicircle because of the sun's low angle. That can also be seen in that only the top of the monument is illuminated; the sun sets sooner at the base than the point. (Deanne de Lima via Facebook)\n\nTowering in the sky\n\nIf you found yourself craning your neck to enjoy the bow\u2019s full splendor, blame the time of day. The lower the sun is to the horizon, the higher the bow! As a result, this was the closest to a perfect half-circle rainbow you will ever see from the District. A sunset bow is the limit for the highest bow any location can experience. If you\u2019re looking for a ground-hugging bow, try closer to noon (although how low it gets is limited by your latitude and sensible weather.)\n\nAnd, if you want to behold the full circle bow, you have to be up in the air, like this lucky eyewitness:\n\n@capitalweather Sure, the photos of the rainbow from the ground last night were really cool - but @CurlNoire managed to get footage of it FROM A PLANE! Absolutely stunning. #WashingtonDC pic.twitter.com/8HoZaNhMe4 \u2014 Zach Cusson (@zcusson) October 23, 2019\n\nAll around the Washington region, gorgeous views of the striking rainbow emerged. We received scores of amazing photos and even some video from our readers and share a sample below.\n\n\n\nRainbow overlooking downtown Bethesda on Tuesday evening.
