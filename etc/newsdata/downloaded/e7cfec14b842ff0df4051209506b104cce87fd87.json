The bad news is they have to come back to the Etihad Stadium in three days\u2019 time, when Pep Guardiola will doubtless wheel out his big guns.\n\nHaving been obliterated 9-0 by Leicester City last Friday, the memory of that calamity must have been firmly in Southampton minds when Manchester City plundered their third goal with 34 minutes still left to play.\n\nAt that stage, no one would have been surprised if this had turned into another hammering so, in that respect, Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl was pleased with how his Southampton players rallied, weathered the storm and pulled a goal back through Jack Stephens.\n\nIt will certainly offer them some crumbs of comfort ahead of their return here in the Premier League, even if the likes of Raheem Sterling, Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva will be back in the champions\u2019 line-up then.\n\nSouthampton will also probably have to contend again with Sergio Ag\u00fcero, who, after watching fellow Argentinian Nicolas Otamendi open the scoring, plundered his 242nd and 243rd goals for City on his 350th appearance for the club, the equivalent of a goal every 1.44 games. To put that into some context, Thierry Henry averaged a goal every 1.64 games for Arsenal and Alan Shearer, the Premier League\u2019s all-time top scorer, one every 1.71 for Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United.\n\nHasenh\u00fcttl admitted he had feared the worst when Ag\u00fcero claimed his second but, by the end, was both pleased and relieved by the reaction of his players. So how was he feeling? \u201cBetter than Friday, I must say,\u201d the Southampton manager said, mustering a smile.", "description": "The good news for Southampton is this game is behind them.", "authors": ["James Ducker", "Jj Bull", "Northern Football Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/29/TELEMMGLPICT000214533231-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZNTDy2SfQzBrPZuiqZL_ffrnIIH0zqTYoIf7L6cqnQs.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
