It's a massive amount of money they have paid for him and Lille will be laughing all the way to the bank with that one.\n\n'It's still early days and maybe the player will turn it around but I haven't really seen what I expected to see from him.'\n\nHe has one goal and two assists in nine appearances for the Gunners since joining from Lille\n\nMichael Owen was equally critical on Thursday night and wants to see more from Pepe\n\nMichael Owen was just as critical, admitting his impressive start to life at Arsenal has quickly faded away.\n\n'We're talking a lot of positives about Arsenal at the moment but I think there is one little negative eating away and that is Pepe,' Owen added.\n\n'I was excited by him, I saw him in the French league and he looked a very good player, he started the first game and looked like he had a bag of tricks but he's just gone off the boil.\n\n'That's a huge investment for anybody but it is a huge investment for Arsenal.\n\n'I'd like to see him come on and play really well today, against an average team, show his stuff and get a bit of confidence. That's a concern.'", "description": "The Ivorian winger is Arsenal's \u00a372million club-record signing but has struggled to live up to expectations that followed his megamoney move to the Emirates Stadium from Ligue 1.", "authors": ["Max Winters For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/07/19285410-0-image-a-2_1570169661184.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
