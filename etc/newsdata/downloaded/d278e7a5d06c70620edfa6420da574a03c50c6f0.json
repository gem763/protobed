Caso sees \"more stable near-term conditions\" for Apple, including encouraging iPhone 11 channel checks. His new target is the highest listed on FactSet. Amid reports that the company plans to launch a new low-end SE model early next year, Caso argues that Apple will be able to \"create a bridge to the 5G cycle,\" which will \"continue to squeeze shares higher,\" in his view. \"We increasingly view the 5G opportunity as a two-year cycle, with 5G representing an estimated 40% of mix in the fall 2020 cycle, growing to the vast majority in the 2021 cycle,\" Caso wrote of his longer-term expectations.
