The RBA is expected to wait until at least February to decide if more stimulus is required.\"\n\nThe need for a move will be determined in part by what the Federal Reserve does with US rates, since the RBA might be forced to act just to prevent an export-sapping increase in the Aussie dollar.\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to ease later on Wednesday, but investors are less certain if that will be the last one. Any signal the Fed is done, would lessen the need for another RBA move and would tend to push up local bond yields.\n\nYields on three-year paper have already drifted up to 0.80 per cent, having hit an historic low of 0.60 per cent early in the month, while 10-year bonds paid 1.147 per cent.\n\nThe three-year bond futures contract was 2 ticks firmer on the day at 99.210, while the 10-year contract rose 4 ticks to 95.8550.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Banking & Finance - [SYDNEY] The Australian dollar crept higher on Wednesday as data on domestic inflation proved no softer than expected, leading investors to price out almost any chance of a cut in interest rates next week. .
