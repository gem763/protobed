Giuliani, President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, declaring that department officials would not have met with Mr. Giuliani to discuss one of his clients had they known that federal prosecutors in New York were investigating two of his associates. Several weeks ago, Brian A. Benczkowski, the head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, and lawyers from the division\u2019s Fraud Section met with Mr. Giuliani to discuss a bribery case in which he and other attorneys were representing the defendants.\n\nPeter Carr, a spokesman for DOJ, told the Times:\n\nWhen Mr. Benczkowski and fraud section lawyers met with Mr. Giuliani, they were not aware of any investigation of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s associates in the Southern District of New York and would not have met with him had they known.\n\nDOJ officials met with Giuliani before the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan charged his associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, with breaking campaign finance laws to gain political influence.\n\nParnas and Fruman reportedly played a role in Giuliani\u2019s efforts to push Ukraine to investigate corruption allegations against Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nLast week, Fiona Hill, a former Russia adviser at Trump\u2019s National Security Council (NSC), told impeachment investigators that Giuliani ran a shadow foreign policy in Ukraine, bypassing U.S. officials and career diplomats.\n\nThe Times pointed out:\n\nEven as Mr. Giuliani ran a shadow foreign policy campaign to pressure Ukraine to investigate the president\u2019s political enemies \u2014 which is now at the heart of an impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump \u2014 he and his business associates were under criminal investigation for unlawfully wielding political influence. And while all of this was happening, Mr. Giuliani still served as a lawyer to clients with cases to plead before the Justice Department.\n\nFormer U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and the Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland confirmed to impeachment investigators that they worked on Ukraine policy with Giuliani.\n\nSondland testified that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d at Trump\u2019s order to work with Giuliani.\n\n\u201cOur view was that the men and women of the State Department, not the president\u2019s personal lawyer, should take responsibility for all aspects of U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine,\u201d Sondland declared in written remarks prepared for his deposition last Thursday.\n\nGiuliani has maintained he did nothing wrong in Ukraine. Echoing House Republican lawmakers, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended Trump\u2019s decision to rely on Giuliani in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThis is completely appropriate,\u2019\u2019 Pompeo said on ABC News\u2019 This Week, adding, \u201cThere have been private citizens [involved in diplomacy] all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President is allowed to have whoever he thinks is going to serve the interests of the country doing work for him,\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) added last week\n\nDOJ has refused to confirm or deny reports that Trump\u2019s private lawyer is under investigation, the Times acknowledged.\n\nHouse Democrats pursuing the impeachment probe are trying to determine if Trump abused his power by allegedly pressuring Ukraine to investigate the Bidens in exchange for aid. Trump and Ukraine have denied the allegations. Democrats, however, have suggested their impeachment inquiry may extend beyond Ukraine.", "description": "The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) reportedly revealed that it is opting to keep Trump's private lawyer Rudy Giuliani at arm's length.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/wi/afp/25/bc07a5_new-york-mayor-rudy-giuliani-was-deeply-involved-in-president-donald-trump-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
