Things are hazy after that.\n\nAD\n\nMinor was one strikeout away from his goal by the top of the eighth, but had a 1-2-3 inning when the Red Sox offered at three pitches and produced three outs. Minor returned to the mound in the ninth, and with one out, first baseman Ronald Guzman intentionally let a popup from Boston\u2019s Chris Owings drop in foul territory.\n\nAD\n\nGuzman was reportedly following the orders of Minor, who instructed him not to catch the ball, according to ESPN.\n\n\u201cWe were yelling, telling [Guzman] to drop it because there\u2019s going to be two strikes,\u201d Minor said. \u201cHe dropped it, and then he looked at me like, \u2018What? Why?\u2019 And then everybody started booing or whatever. I had to thank him for that, because [the fans] didn\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMike Minor told Guzman to drop this foul ball so he could still have a chance at his 200th strikeout of the season pic.twitter.com/PfP7E1ZPma \u2014 MyBookie Sportsbook (@betmybookie) September 26, 2019\n\nMinor struck Owings out on the next pitch, but Rangers Manager Chris Woodward said after the game he wasn\u2019t thrilled by the tactic. But he also accused the Red Sox of attempting to keep Minor from his milestone in the eighth.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t love the idea that we dropped a popup at the end, Woodward said. \u201cBut on the other side of that, they swung at three pitches in a row in the eighth inning down by two.\u201d\n\nRed Sox Manager Alex Cora offered more subtle shade: \u201cI\u2019m just happy our guys are playing the game the right way,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nAD\n\nThe Rangers beat the Red Sox, 7-5, but the dropped popup was the focus of most conversations after the game. The most searing criticism may have come from the Boston Globe\u2019s Pete Abraham, who on Twitter said Minor\u2019s milestone should have an asterisk. He called the pitcher\u2019s methods \u201cunprofessional.\u201d\n\n\u201cAsk me if I care Pete,\u201d Minor responded.\n\nAsk me if I care Pete \u2014 Mike Minor (@MikeMinor36) September 26, 2019\n\nRead More:\n\nMLB playoff bracket and schedule\n\nHe snagged a historic home run ball.
