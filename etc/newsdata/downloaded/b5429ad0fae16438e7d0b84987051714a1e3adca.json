Whenever I learning something new, Tommy is the first person I tell.\n\n\"I'm teaching him more vocabulary and cooking and he teaches me about stuff like sports.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nYesterday, Tommy revealed that he and Molly Mae Hague are trying for a baby.\n\nThe 20-year-old boxer said he can't wait to have a family with Molly and wants to have twins with her by the time he is 22.\n\nThe pair look set to have their hands full as Tommy also said he wants to have eight children in total with his influencer girlfriend.\n\nHe made the revelation during an candid Q&A with fans Molly Mae's YouTube Channel.\n\n(Image: Youtube)\n\nThe pair were sitting side by side on their sofa when they were asked if they had plans to start a family.\n\nMolly began: \"We both definitely want children.
