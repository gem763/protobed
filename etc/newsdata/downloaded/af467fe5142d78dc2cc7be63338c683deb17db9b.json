It's unclear when the 78-year-old senator will return to the stump. His campaign has yet to divulge the severity of his heart attack.\n\nAnd that sequence of events unfolded as he's been eclipsed in the polls by the other progressive icon in the race, Elizabeth Warren.\n\nNow Sanders and his campaign are laboring to contain the cloud of uncertainty that's formed over his candidacy. According to interviews with Sanders\u2019 aides and surrogates, they\u2019re betting that his performance at next week's debate and on the campaign trail will show he still has the stamina to run for and serve as president.\n\nSanders' staffers also plan to emphasize how his health scare demonstrates the need for Medicare for All.\n\nThroughout the Democratic Party, however, insiders and strategists are openly questioning the effect his heart attack would have on his bid for the White House \u2014 and on the primary as a whole. Sanders' team is also coming under fire from some journalists and Democrats for not announcing earlier that he suffered a heart attack. His aides have declined to allow reporters to interview Sanders\u2019 doctors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where the cover-up is worse than the crime,\u201d said Andres Ramirez, a Nevada-based Democratic strategist and former vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s Hispanic Caucus. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody would have cared if they said he had a heart attack, got out a few days later, and then everything\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nInstead, he said, \u201cThere seemed to be a refusal or hesitance to say, \u2018Bernie Sanders had a heart attack.\u2019 \u2026 I think it\u2019s less of an issue about his age and more of an issue of, \u2018Hey, Bernie, you\u2019re supposed to be the transparent candidate.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn an all-staff conference call described to POLITICO by people who listened in, Sanders suggested on Monday that he would use his experience to pivot back to one of his campaign\u2019s central ideas. The same afternoon, he and his wife, Jane, also made a brief appearance leaving his home in Vermont for what appeared to be a brisk walk.\n\n\"If there's anything that this event kind of tell us, it is the importance of what our message is in this campaign. And our message is, 'Us, not me.' This has never been about me,\" Sanders told his team during the call. \"It's been about millions of people, including certainly our campaign staff, working together to bring about the kind of fundamental changes this nation absolutely needs.\"\n\nSanders\u2019 aides are adamant they handled the health incident appropriately and have taken to social media to defend themselves against criticism, which has come from reporters such as NBC News correspondent Andrea Mitchell and Rolling Stone senior writer Jamil Smith. The aides said they provided several updates on Sanders\u2019 recovery last week, released a statement from his doctors, and made his wife available for questions.\n\n\u201cNot one person with this hysterical take can articulate a legitimate risk that three days of privacy (followed by disclosure) over a year before an election presented to the republic,\u201d Briahna Joy Gray, Sanders\u2019 national press secretary, wrote on Twitter.\n\nMike Casca, a spokesman for Sanders, told POLITICO that the campaign disclosed that he had a heart attack \u201cwhen the most accurate and up-to-date summary could be given by doctors.\"\n\nWhen Sanders returns to the stump, he will be confronted with a barrage of questions about his age and health \u2014 a less-than-ideal position for any candidate, let alone one who often loathes talking about his personal life. Polls have shown for months that many Democratic voters are wary of nominating a candidate in their 70s, and Sanders had slipped to third place in national polling averages before his heart attack.\n\n\u201cBernie will address it by having a strong debate performance, by being out on the trail, and showing that he\u2019s more energized and has more fighting spirit than ever before,\u201d said Rep. Ro Khanna, Sanders\u2019 campaign co-chair. \u201cI think that\u2019s ultimately what will convince people that he has the fight in him.\u201d\n\nAdded a Sanders aide: \u201cAs Bernie\u2019s done his whole career by being right on the issues even when no one else was with him, we'll be in \u2018show, don't tell\u2019 mode.\u201d", "description": "Bernie Sanders has been sidelined for nearly a week \u2014 after failing for almost three days to disclose that he had a heart attack.
