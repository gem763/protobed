And the reason is very simple, which is that in consumer goods, the big guys, the big companies are setting the agenda of what's on shelf,\" Leoni Sceti told CNBC last week.\n\nIf a smaller brand that uses ingredients that are in limited supply gets a listing at a large store, for example, it may have to cut back or replace that ingredient to be able to compete on price, he said. Writing on The Craftory's website, co-founder Ernesto Schmitt stated: \"It's hard to be the champion of healthy nutrition when you're one bottle facing against 75 Coca-Colas on the shelf, whereas you can stand free and bold, noteworthy all because of yourself, online.\"\n\nSmaller, new brands are \"cool because I know about it and you don't,\" Leoni Sceti said. \"Then you spend money (on distribution in mass retail), you grow it, and then it loses his cool. So, it's a vicious cycle,\" he said.", "description": "Getting mass distribution on the shelves of huge retailers may not be the best way forward for new consumer-goods brands, according to the co-founder of a new venture capital (VC) business The Craftory.", "authors": ["Lucy Handley"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106209764-1572350875892gettyimages-1141999304.jpeg?v=1572350927", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
