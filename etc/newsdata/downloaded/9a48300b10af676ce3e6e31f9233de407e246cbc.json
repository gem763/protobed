At this point, the wedge needs to be broken in one direction or the other, and it could lead to a rather volatile movement. The 50 day EMA is currently trading in the middle of the range for the day, so it\u2019s likely that we will continue to see a lot of back-and-forth in the meantime, at least until we get some type of resolution to the US/China situation, be it good or bad.\n\nSILVER Video 14.10.19\n\nTo the downside, the $17.00 level should offer significant support from a structural and psychological standpoint, so if we do break down below there then I think the market will probably go racing towards the 200 day EMA. To the upside, if we were to break above the $18.00 level, then it\u2019s likely that the market will go looking towards the $18.75 level, and then perhaps even the highs again that are closer to the $20.00 level. This is going to be based on fear or headline noise, so keep in mind that paying attention to the overall trend lines probably is the best way to trade this market as it\u2019s essentially a \u201c50-50 ball\u201d at the moment.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "The Silver markets initially tried to rally during the trading session on Friday but continues to find a lot of resistance above at the downtrend line that forms the major wedge that I have marked out.
