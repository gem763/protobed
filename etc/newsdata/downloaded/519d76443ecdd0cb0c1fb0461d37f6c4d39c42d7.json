The cathedral rises above the treetops \u2013 caught half in sun, half in shade \u2013 like a northern Notre Dame, while, below, kayakers tool around on the meandering River Wear just beyond the rushing weir. The shot is beautifully framed by the tree in the foreground, which is rendered almost black in shadow. During his 23-year career at the Guardian, Thorpe covered assignments across the globe \u2013 from the Soviet Union to Japan \u2013 but returned again and again to his native northern England.\n\nBuy your exclusive print here\n\nPrice\n\n\u00a350, including free delivery\n\nPrints\n\nPhotographs are 30x40cm and presented on museum-grade, fine-art paper stocks, with archival standards guaranteeing quality for 100+ years.
