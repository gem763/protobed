Every day, millions of us drop a plastic bottle or cardboard container into the recycling bin - and we feel we're doing our bit for the environment. But what we may not realise is that most plastic never gets recycled at all, often ending up in landfill or incineration depots instead. Of 30 billion plastic bottles used by UK households each year, only 57 per cent are currently recycled, with half going to landfill, half go to waste. Most plastic never gets recycled at all, often ending up in landfill or incineration depots instead Around 700,000 plastic bottles a day end up as litter. This is largely due to plastic wrapping around bottles that are non-recyclable. Every year, the UK throws away 2.5 billion 'paper' cups, amounting to 5,000 cups a minute. Shockingly, less than 0.4 per cent of these are recycled. Most cups are made from cardboard with a thin layer of plastic. This has previously posed issues with recycling but can now be removed . Five specialist recycling plants in the UK have the capacity to recycle all the cups used on our high-streets. Ensuring the paper cups end up in these plants and are not discarded incorrectly is one of the biggest issues facing the recycling of the paper vessels.\n\n'We're pleased that as a first step, major retailers operating in hospitals have committed to cut their plastics, starting with straws and stirrers, cutlery, plates and cups.'\n\nRuth May, chief nursing officer for England, said: 'Across the NHS, nurses, midwives and other frontline staff are providing great leadership on environmental issues and championing sustainability where they work.\n\n'Support from local NHS organisations to sign the pledge and cut use of catering plastics will need all NHS staff to take action in their own areas and encourage their employers to go further faster.'\n\nNHS England said many parts of the NHS are already tackling single-use plastic.\n\nThe Yorkshire Ambulance Service is saving around four tonnes of plastic waste each year after a campaign to remove it from the staff canteen.\n\nThe trust replaced plastic milk bottles with glass, plastic cutlery with wood and plastic drinks bottles with cans.\n\nIt also introduced a water refill point. Meanwhile, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has removed more than half a million single-use plastic items from its canteens, including 227,000 pieces of cutlery and 231,180 cups.\n\nJulian Kirby, Friends of the Earth plastics campaigner, said:'It's great to see the NHS committing to reducing pointless plastic.\n\n'The key is for throw-away items like plastic cups and stirrers to be replaced by reusable items, and for things like water fountains to be much more common.\n\n'But we shouldn't be relying on voluntary schemes and cash-strapped hospitals to get rid of the pointless plastic in our public spaces.\n\n'We urgently need a comprehensive plan from government and support to make it happen.'\n\nHelen Bird, of sustainability charity Wrap (the Waste and Resources Action Programme), said: 'It's positive to see the NHS taking action to turn the tide on plastic waste, removing plastic items where they do not make sense for the environment, and looking for alternatives to materials which are not recyclable, like expanded polystyrene cups.\n\n'It sends a strong message to the public and suppliers to the NHS; our throwaway culture will become a thing of the past.'", "description": "Health chiefs have vowed to scrap more than 100million single-use plastics by phasing the material out from its catering operation and on-site stores.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/16/19595874-0-image-a-34_1570807422808.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
