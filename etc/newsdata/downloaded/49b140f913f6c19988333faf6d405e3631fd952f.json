It not only continues to develop its traditional friendship, trade and cultural exchanges with neighboring countries, it has also taken steps to promote mutual benefits and foster further collaboration in the region.\n\n\"We will strengthen the connectivity of ports, highways, railways and airports and encourage more airlines to open more routes to jointly build a Trans-Himalaya connectivity network and deepen cooperation in the areas of trade, tourism, investment and livelihood,\" Jiang said.\n\nGobinda Bahadur Karkee, consul-general of Nepal in Lhasa, said Nepal and China are friendly neighbors linked by mountains, rivers and culture.
