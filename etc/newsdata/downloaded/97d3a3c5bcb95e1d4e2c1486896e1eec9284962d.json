Its mission is to \"restore\" drug addicts at faith-based group homes and raise money to open churches in other cities to do the same, according to the indictment.\n\nThe church's former pastor was among the 12 arrested.\n\n\"The indictment alleges an appalling abuse of power by church officials who preyed on vulnerable homeless people with promises of a warm bed and meals,\" U.S. Attorney Robert Brewer said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThese victims were held captive, stripped of their humble financial means, their identification, their freedom and their dignity.\"\n\nGoogle Map Street View\n\nSome victims said they were forced to panhandle as many as 54 hours a week for the financial benefit of church leaders, while others reported being held in so-called rehabilitation homes against their will, prosecutors said.\n\n\"The indictment alleges that church leaders locked victims inside group homes with deadbolt locks; confiscated identification documents such as driver\u2019s licenses, passports, immigration papers and identification cards, in order to prevent victims from escaping,\" prosecutors said in a statement. \"Many victims, including many who did not require drug rehabilitation services, claimed they were later held at IVM properties against their will.\"\n\nThe victims said they were required to sign agreements and adhere to strict rules. The agreement included phrases like \"you are not to discuss things of the world\" and \"the only thing to be read is the holy bible\" and \"if any of the rules are broken there will be discipline.\"\n\nPunishments for violations of rules allegedly included the withholding of food.\n\nThe alleged scam came to light when a 17-year-old escaped by breaking a window that had been nailed shut, according to the statement. The teen ran to a neighboring property to call the police and be treated for cuts sustained in the escape.\n\nABC News' Alex Stone contributed to this report.", "description": "They were charged with conspiracy, forced labor, document servitude and benefits fraud.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/imperial-valley-ministries-ht-jef-190910_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
