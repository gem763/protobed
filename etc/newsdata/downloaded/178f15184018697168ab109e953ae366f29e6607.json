The pilots then put on oxygen masks as a result of the smoke.\n\nThey then decided to divert the plane, which had 11 crew members and 326 passengers on board, to Shannon Airport in the west of Ireland. No one was injured.\n\n\"The resulting electrical burning smell and smoke in the cockpit necessitated a diversion to Shannon Airport,\" the report said.\n\nA spokeswoman for Condor told USA Today: \"After the aircraft was fully inspected and repaired by our team of engineers, the flight continued via Manchester due to the legal operating hours of the crew.\"\n\nManufacturer Airbus recommends pilots use cup holders to avoid any spillages, but Condor's cups were too small\n\nAirbus, which manufactured the A330-243 plane flying the route, recommends that pilots use the cup holder in the cockpit of its planes, according to the AAIB report.\n\nBut the cups used by Condor on the route were smaller than most, which made it difficult to take the cups in and out of the holders, the report said.\n\nThis meant the pilots did not use the cupholders, despite Airbus' policy, the AAIB said.\n\n\"A lid properly secured on the top of the cup may have reduced the amount of liquid spilled on the centre console,\" the AAIB said.\n\nIn response, Condor changed its procedure to make sure their cup lids are provided on all of its flights and \"reminded cabin crew of the requirement to use them,\" the report said.\n\nIt also reminded pilots \"to be careful with liquid\" and said it would supply cups that were a better size for the cupholders in future.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The spilled coffee caused cockpit smoke and even melted a button, harming communication between the crew and forcing them to divert the flight.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9361/d96c4ada94a14385887783055a29bc0c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
