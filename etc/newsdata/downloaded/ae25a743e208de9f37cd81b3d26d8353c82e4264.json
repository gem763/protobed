I believe that banning political ads \u2026 favors incumbents,\u201d he said at Georgetown University.\n\nMr. Zuckerbeg participated in a forum that was part of the school\u2019s speaker series \u201cDemocracy in the Digital Age.\u201d He spoke for more than 30 minutes before answering a handful of questions submitted by students.\n\nHis remarks focused on his view that Facebook valued \u2018voice\u2019 and \u2018inclusion\u2019 in the furtherance of free expression. Without identifying political actors such as Sen. Kamala Harris (D-California) who have called for the de-platforming of political opponents online, Mr. Zuckerberg railed against the idea underpinning the practice of de-platforming.\n\n\u201cSome people believe that giving people a voice is driving division rather than bringing people together,\u201d he said. \u201cMore people across the spectrum believe that achieving the political outcomes that they think matter is more important than every person having a voice and being heard. And I think that\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\n\nGeorgetown is the latest stop on Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s charm offensive aimed at skeptical audiences. Since July, Mr. Zuckerberg has privately courted political conservatives, reportedly including Sen. Lindsey Graham, Fox News personality Tucker Carlson and conservative commentator Ben Shapiro.\n\nMany conservatives, however, remain skeptical of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s approach. The newly formed Internet Accountability Project is a conservative advocacy group aiming to get the federal and state government to rein in \u201cBig Tech\u201d companies such as Facebook, Amazon and Google.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s doing it, but these kinds of pats on the head are not enough,\u201d said Rachel Bovard, IAP senior advisor and former legislative director for Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, of Zuckerberg\u2019s trek to Georgetown.\n\nMs. Bovard said platforms such as Facebook \u201callow human misery to flourish\u201d and the time has come for meaningful action from government.\n\nEarlier this week, Congress began taking new action in the realm of internet regulation. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Tennessee Republican and leader of the Judiciary Committee tech task force, convened a closed-door meeting with policy experts on the Hill on Wednesday about consumer data privacy rights.\n\nParticipants included Maureen Ohlhausen, former acting chairman of the Federal Trade Commission and Baker Botts partner; Nathan Taylor, Morrison & Foerster partner; Michelle Richardson, the Center for Democracy & Technology\u2019s director of its privacy and data project; and Jennifer Daskal, an American University associate law professor.\n\nThe House Committee on Energy & Commerce, also on Wednesday, held a hearing on \u201cfostering a healthier internet to protect consumers\u201d featuring testimony from Steve Huffman, co-founder and CEO of Reddit, and Katherine Oyama, Google\u2019s global head of intellectual property policy.\n\nNext week, Mr. Zuckerberg will face the House Financial Services Committee to answer questions about Facebook\u2019s new cryptocurrency endeavor, named Libra.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
