Williams battled a slew of health complications, including a rupture in her cesarean stitches, leaving her bedridden for the first six weeks of motherhood.\n\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t know what I was getting into,\u201d Ohanian told FOX Business during an interview on Monday. \u201cI just thought, \u2018Let me be a leader and take my full leave.\u2019 That was only after the birth of our daughter and the complications my wife faced that I realized just how important it was for every American to have access to it. We have every advantage imaginable, and this was still a traumatic time.\u201d\n\nAmong developed nations, the U.S. remains an outlier: Out of 41 nations, it\u2019s the only country that does not require companies to provide paid time off for new parents, according to data compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. And last March, a mere 17 percent of all workers had access to paid family leave, the Department of Labor found.\n\nOhanian plans to change that.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 36-year-old, alongside Dove Men+Care and the nonprofit Paid Leave US, is heading to Capitol Hill for a Dads\u2019 Day of Action, meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers to push for mandated paid parental leave. Ohanian said some of those legislators include: Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. and Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C. The group also plans to meet with representatives from Democratic presidential candidates, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Cory Booker.\n\n\"I fully expect every presidential candidate to have a specific policy plan for paid parental leave,\" he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a nation that prides ourselves on the family being at the heart of everything. This really feels like an inevitability for a country that talks about how important the family.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Ohanian said he\u2019d like to see six months of federally mandated paid family leave for every American \u2014 a demand that he believes is in the realm of possibility. Ohanian, who co-founded Reddit in 2005, then sold it 16 months later to Cond\u00e9 Nast for an undisclosed amount, also pointed to the business aspect. Not only will companies try to compete with each other for better policies, he said, but employees will become more productive.\n\nThe entrepreneur now works at the venture capital company he co-founded, Initialized Capital, where there are currently three fathers on leave at the same time (like Reddit, Initialized Capital also offers four months of paid family leave). A key part of that mandated leave, he said, is allowing flexibility in how employees take that time off. For instance, if a new dad wants to take off every Friday until the allotted time runs out, companies should allow him to take it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kidding ourselves if we think our employees\u2019 home life has no effect on their work life,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see a very crystal-clear business case for why this makes sense.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Ohanian's wife almost died giving birth - and he says paid parental leave was crucial in caring for his family.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/wiliams20ohanian20getty202017.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
