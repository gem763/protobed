What should I do?", "language": "en", "text": "Dear Moneyist,\n\nI have repeatedly asked my husband to write a will. He gives me excuses and puts me off. I\u2019m so frustrated that we don\u2019t have a will that I\u2019m almost ready to write my own without him. We have no children, so I\u2019m thinking we should be each other\u2019s beneficiaries and then decide what would happen to our assets if we passed at the same time.\n\n\u2018Why is he leaving tens of thousands of dollars to his mom? Is she going to be responsible for planning his funeral?\u2019\n\nI found out last night that he has allocated his entire savings account \u2014 roughly six months\u2019 worth of living expenses \u2014 TO HIS MOTHER. He designated her on the rights of survivorship form when he opened the account. When I confronted him about it, he told me \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. You\u2019re my beneficiary on my life insurance.\u201d\n\nOK, fine. But why is he leaving tens of thousands of dollars to his mom? Is she going to be responsible for planning his funeral? I\u2019m beyond upset, and my question is ultimately this: Is it common to leave a large chunk of money to your parent(s) instead of your spouse?\n\nHis mom is financially stable, she has her own business, takes vacations, etc. I always thought the standard practice was to leave everything to your spouse?\n\nDisgruntled Wife\n\nDear Disgruntled,\n\nEveryone should have a will, especially a married couple. Too many people die without a will and it causes multiple problems and legal battles for those who are left behind. Today is a good time to have this conversation and discuss your respective assets.\n\nIf this column has taught me anything, it\u2019s that there are no standard practices. I\u2019ve received so many letters from people who have felt befuddled, bewildered and brutalized by their spouse or parent\u2019s will. One man told me his father left him $10,000 and, in his mind, that meant his father didn\u2019t love him. A young man wrote to me to say he believed he was robbed of his inheritance by his parents and sister because of his sexuality. I felt bad for him, but it was their choice.\n\nPeople view the contents of wills and beneficiaries as a reflection of the depth of commitment and feeling within their relationship.\n\nAnother woman said her father had given her his word that she could buy his home, but then went back on his promise after she devoted years to him as a caregiver. Alas, I could see the writing on the wall as soon as she told me what her father had promised her. This mother said she didn\u2019t want a red cent from her estranged husband because he was abusive. And this woman wanted to hold off on divorcing her husband until he received his inheritance.\n\nMy point? Emotions run high when it comes to beneficiaries on life insurance policies, and retirement and bank accounts. Many people see this as a reflection of the depth of commitment and love within their relationship. If you\u2019re not on your husband\u2019s savings account does that mean he doesn\u2019t love you? No, it does not. Does it mean that you won\u2019t be taken care of? No, it does not. Does it mean you won\u2019t inherit 100% of your husband\u2019s assets? Yes, it does.\n\nIs this savings account a small (or large) slice of your husband\u2019s entire net worth? Why shouldn\u2019t his mother get something?\n\nOnly you know the details of your financial lives. Context is everything. Will you have enough money to live on after your husband dies? Did he alone save this money and is he entitled to do what he wants with them? Yes. Do you share the title on your home and will you have somewhere to live for your remaining days if he predeceases you? Is this savings account a small (or large) slice of your husband\u2019s entire net worth? Why shouldn\u2019t his mother get something?\n\nHis mother gave him life. He wouldn\u2019t be here without her. She probably sacrificed a lot for him and, in the unlikely event that he predeceases her, he may simply wish to say thank you and make sure that she wants for nothing. That\u2019s his right. It is his mother, after all. Perhaps rather than \u201cconfront\u201d him about this decision, you could ask him about his thought process when he made it. As long as you are financially comfortable if he dies first \u2014 and vice-versa \u2014 I don\u2019t see a problem.\n\nThere is a larger conversation to be had here about the importance of leaving a will and taking a bird\u2019s eye view of the assets that you both brought into this marriage. Before having this conversation, however, I\u2019d leave his mother and his funeral expenses out of it.\n\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?
