If Gabbard\u2019s not going to shill for Trump when the chips are down, of what use is she ultimately to Fox News and MAGA Nation? Right, great, she dealt a heavy blow to Kamala Harris at the second debate. Protecting Trump from impeachment matters much more.\n\nI pointed out on Tuesday when she sounded like a no on impeachment that she was placing herself in an awkward position politically. She just qualified for the October presidential debate, after all; she\u2019s going to be onstage next month on national television at a moment when her party is racing towards impeaching the president with near-unanimous support among its own base. She was certain to be asked about her stance at that debate. Anything she might conceivably say about the drawbacks of impeachment \u2014 it\u2019s divisive, it\u2019s another blow to political norms, it\u2019s proceeding without due deliberation \u2014 would be interpreted by lefties as treason against the party. She\u2019d wreck her political future at the tender age of 38.\n\nShe needed to climb down, and so today she did.\n\n\u201cHowever, after looking carefully at the transcript of the conversation with Ukraine\u2019s President, the whistleblower complaint, the Inspector General memo, and President Trump\u2019s comments about the issue, unfortunately, I believe that if we do not proceed with the inquiry, it will set a very dangerous precedent. Future presidents, as well as anyone in positions of power in the government, will conclude that they can abuse their position for personal gain, without fear of accountability or consequences. \u201cIf we allow the President to abuse his or her power, then our society will rot from top to bottom. We will turn into a banana republic, where people in positions of power\u2014from the president all the way down to the traffic cop\u2014will feel it\u2019s okay to abuse their power with no consequences. \u201cThis is not the kind of country that any of us want to see.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s not calling for impeachment but for an impeachment inquiry, the same sort of hedge Pelosi has used lately. Democrats aren\u2019t committed to impeaching the president (officially) but they are now committed to investigating the Ukraine matter in the expectation that it\u2019ll lead to impeachment if the claims are substantiated. Gabbard hedges a bit more for the MAGA fans in her base when she goes on to say that the Democrats\u2019 inquiry \u201cmust be swift, thorough, and narrowly-focused\u201d and \u201ccannot be turned into a long, protracted partisan circus.\u201d She even uses the word \u201cunfortunate\u201d not once but twice in her statement to signal her deep, deep misgivings about taking this position \u2014 although, in fairness, she also notes Trump\u2019s own comments about the Ukraine matter as a contributing factor in her reversal. I wonder which comments, specifically. These, maybe?\n\nAnd so we come to the question: Wha\u2019 happened? Did Gabbard flip-flop because she really was persuaded by the whistleblower complaint that there might be corruption here? Was it a simple matter of her knowing her position would be untenable onstage at the next debate?\n\nOr was it something else? Meet Kai Kehele, Democrat and candidate for office in Hawaii\u2019s Second District. That\u2019s Gabbard\u2019s district. He\u2019s challenging her in the primary and he\u2019s been playing her reluctance to impeach Trump, which she had called \u201cdivisive,\u201d to the hilt on Twitter this week:\n\nSome say impeachment will tear this country apart, I say that Donald Trump has already torn our country apart. He clearly has put his own self-interest & self-profiting above the interests of the American people. It is time for Congress to fulfill it\u2019s constitutional duty. \u2014 Kai Kahele (@kaikahele) September 23, 2019\n\nDoing the following is divisive: * Calling Mexicans \"rapists\"\n\n* Calling Africa a \"S\u2013hole\"\n\n* Saying Neo-Nazis are \"Very fine people\" Holding Donald Trump accountable is not divisive, its Congress doing its job of upholding the Constitution. Donate. https://t.co/lqfGNqx1lV https://t.co/20CfIrujGp \u2014 Kai Kahele (@kaikahele) September 25, 2019\n\nIt baffles me that any responsible Member of Congress who has taken the time to read & process the Mueller Report, the Ukraine call memo and the whistle-blower's report can still be opposed to opening an impeachment inquiry. #Impeach45 \u2014 Kai Kahele (@kaikahele) September 27, 2019\n\nAs of this morning, just 12 Democrats in the House still opposed an impeachment inquiry into the Ukraine matter. Eleven of the 12 come from purplish districts, many won by Trump in 2016. Opposing the president under those circumstances is risky. The only exception: Tulsi Gabbard, whose home district in Hawaii broke for Hillary Clinton by more than 30 points. Her stance is \u2014 or was \u2014 waaaay out of step with the partisan tendencies of her home state. If Gabbard had stuck to her guns on opposing impeachment and been confronted about it on a national stage at the next debate, donations from outraged lefties would have begun flowing in to Kehele\u2019s campaign from across America. Gabbard would have been at risk of losing her House seat. At the end of the day, Tulsi\u2019s enough of a conventional politician to protect her own career when she has reason to believe it\u2019s in peril.\n\nBy the way, the DNC announced today that the entire field of 12 candidates will be onstage together at the October debate instead of splitting into two groups of six, which means another opportunity for Gabbard to take it to Kamala Harris in a big spot. Maybe she\u2019ll end up back in Trump Nation\u2019s good graces after that. In lieu of an exit question, re-read her statement and note that Gabbard\u2019s standard of potentially impeachable offenses appears to involve \u201cabuses of power,\u201d not statutorily defined crimes. That\u2019s a point that\u2019s already popped up in Trump\u2019s defense among his supporters, including on her friend Tucker\u2019s show: If impeachment is supposed to focus on \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d what specific \u201ccrime\u201d is Trump guilty of? Gabbard appears to be of the view that abuse of power is enough of a crime to justify an inquiry, another point of division between her and Trumpers.", "description": "Oh my.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tg-5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
