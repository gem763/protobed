Now He\u2019s Coming for Your Closet.", "language": "en", "text": "One week before his second New York Fashion Week show, Ali\u00e9tte designer Jason Rembert sat down for his final round of model casting. He had a type of woman in mind: his mother and the label\u2019s eponym, Louisanne Ali\u00e9tte Rembert.\n\n\u201cIn the world I live in, women are of different sizes and ethnicities and height, so I just wanted to give a chance to women who inspired me,\u201d Rembert said of his decision to hold an open call for models in addition to picking girls from various big agencies. \u201cI feel like I would be doing myself a disservice if I didn\u2019t give a fair opportunity to women who looked like my grandmother or mom or aunt or sister.\u201d\n\nRembert\u2019s mother, who raised her five children as a single parent in South Jamaica, Queens and Far Rockaway, Brooklyn, passed away in 2011. She lived to see her son, whom she once dutifully drove to work back when he interned at Elle magazine, begin his career styling Nicki Minaj. Today, Rembert honors her with his unabashedly feminine designs and sees a lot of his mother in his 2-year-old daughter, Harper Ali\u00e9tte Rembert.\n\n\u201cMy daughter is such a strong person,\u201d Rembert said. \u201cShe\u2019s bossing me around and confident in her decisions. It\u2019s the same thing with my mom, she knew what she liked and I think the essence of who they both are shows through the collection.\u201d\n\nRembert is 31 years old, the same age as one of NYFW\u2019s most anticipated designers, Rihanna. He may not be as known outside of the industry as well as Fenty\u2019s creative director is, but the general public has no doubt seen his work.\n\nAn industry veteran, Rembert spent the last decade creating stop-and-stare red carpet appearances for some of pop culture\u2019s most dynamic dressers, from Minaj and Rita Ora to the gender-fluid outfits of Ezra Miller and Michael B. Jordan.\n\n\u201c More than anything, I\u2019m into moments. When I have moments with talent on carpets, it feels like Christmas. It feels like my birthday \u201d\n\nRembert has cornered the market in viral styling\u2014last year, he dressed Miller in a shiny black puffer coat dress by Moncler, which instantly became a meme. (As one tweet summed up, \u201cEzra Miller dressed like a sassy sleeping bag and somehow pulled it off.\u201d)\n\n\u201cMore than anything, I\u2019m into moments,\u201d Rembert said. \u201cWhen I have moments with talent on carpets, it feels like Christmas. It feels like my birthday.\u201d\n\nRembert remembers a lot of \u201cmoments\u201d growing up. Though Manhattan was a half-hour train ride away, his mother created a community when they lived in Queens and Brooklyn, and the family rarely ventured into the city.\n\n\u201cMy mom worked three jobs,\u201d Rembert explained. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the time to come into Manhattan, but sometimes we would go as a family to Times Square to watch a movie. I got my tux for prom at Macy\u2019s or Lord & Taylor.\u201d\n\nRembert\u2019s mother worked odd jobs at H&R Block and as a toll booth worker to make ends meet. \u201cI grew up in the projects, and even though I was on Section 8 and I got food stamps, I never felt less than,\u201d Rembert said. \u201cI never felt like I was poor. I never felt as if I wasn\u2019t taken care of.\u201d\n\nIt was the heyday of Vibe, Quincy Jones\u2019 hip-hop magazine, and Rembert gawked at the fashion he saw in its pages. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the only reason I\u2019m in fashion now,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember opening up Vibe back in the day, and seeing profiles of Missa Hylton, then finding out she\u2019s the person who is behind dressing Lil\u2019 Kim in Chanel and Dior.\u201d\n\nCloser to home, Rembert idolized his Uncle Allen, who would wear head-to-toe Burberry, Cartier sunglasses, and fur coats. \u201cIt\u2019s in now, but back in the day, 25 years ago, it was so cool,\u201d Rembert said. \u201cMan, I wanted to be like that.\u201d His Aunt JoJo held her own too, mixing high and low brands, matching crazy prints to gaudy shoes effortlessly.\n\nThose were foreign, unpronounceable names for a kid in Far Rockaway. \u201cI didn\u2019t know who Christian Lacroix was; I only knew the brand because Lil Kim wore it,\u201d he said. Rembert kept doing his homework, hitting up his generous older brother, J.R., for designer clothes as gifts.\n\n\u201cIn high school, my older brother would buy me whatever I wanted,\u201d Rembert recalled with a smile. \u201cI haven\u2019t made it up to him yet. I would hear Kanye say something on a song, I would hear Pharrell say something on a song, and I\u2019d call my brother like, \u2018Hey, you know you missed my last basketball game, can I get this?\u2019\u201d Somehow, it always worked.\n\nRembert would head into Flushing High School in Prada sneakers, Coogi sweaters, and Pelle Pelle jackets, courtesy of J.R..\n\nAfter Rembert heard Jay-Z sing about Louis Vuitton boots, he asked for a pair as a graduation gift. \u201cIt\u2019s how I became popular,\u201d Rembert shrugged, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s not a good thing. You should go to school for school. But yeah, I was a fun kid. Charismatic, talkative, not shy, and caring.\u201d\n\nHe graduated a year early, and headed off to college as an Econ major, planning to be an actuary. \u201cEvery single person had a pair of Ugg Boots and a Juicy Couture sweatsuit,\u201d Rembert said. \u201cGoing to class and seeing everyone in the same outfit, man, it was a lack of identity. I was dressing up every day and getting fly, but I was just not inspired by the school.\u201d\n\nRembert twice applied to intern at his beloved Vibe, but was turned down two years in a row. One night at 3 a.m., \u201cfed up\u201d with the rejection, he stumbled on a journalism job board and found an unpaid position in the fashion department of Elle.\n\n\u201cI had seen the Elle logo before, knew the spelling, but I didn\u2019t know the extent of what it meant to fashion,\u201d Rembert said. When he woke up a few hours later, there was an email in his inbox asking if he could come in to interview.\n\nRembert rolled into the Hearst Tower on 57th Street in Manhattan wearing a purple velvet blazer from Macy\u2019s with a white button-up shirt and a gray stripe DKNY trouser. He finished the look off with brown Coach loafers. \u201cI thought it was amazing,\u201d Rembert said. \u201cIt was hideous. Horrible. The colors were disgusting. It was the ugliest outfit; I remember it like it was yesterday.\u201d He got the job.\n\nThe next six months were fashion bootcamp for Rembert, who would commute into the city every day with $20 from his mother. He\u2019d only ever dressed himself before, and was suddenly thrust in a fashion closet full of women\u2019s clothes. \u201cI learned a lot about brands then,\u201d he said. \u201cI learned what creative directors were, and I learned to work my ass off. That\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d\n\nIt was the \u201cgolden era\u201d of Elle, Rembert recalled, and he relished the chance to go into work everyday for fashion director Nina Garcia. \u201cI instantly knew fashion was my calling,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you wake up every day, go to work and make zero dollars, lose money, and still go home happy every day? Keep doing it.\u201d\n\n\u201c It wasn\u2019t until I interned a year later when I saw an editor who was black. It affects you \u201d\n\nBut Rembert noticed he was the only black man on staff. It was impossible not to. \u201cOh, 100 percent, I was the only one who even looked like me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I interned a year later when I saw an editor who was black. It affects you. I was very vulnerable in telling people that I didn\u2019t know about women\u2019s fashion, and they were patient and diligent in teaching me. I just learned, basically.\u201d\n\nAnd Rembert just worked, borrowing his mother\u2019s car to drive to pick up big wardrobe bags and deliver the goods to photoshoots. He logged hours as a salesman in Nordstrom for extra cash. His fellow interns all went to Cosi for lunch, but Rembert couldn\u2019t afford his own. He told his mother he felt left out, so she went to Costco and bought salad ingredients, making something off the menu for him to bring in to work everyday.\n\nAfter Elle and W, Rembert had one year of school left, but by now the last thing he wanted to do with his life was be an actuary. Against his family\u2019s wishes\u2014only his mother supported the decision\u2014Rembert dropped out of college and tried his hand at styling. His first clients were Electrik Red, an R&B girl group signed with Def Jam.\n\nWork begot more work, and Rembert began working in the hip-hop world he idolized, styling the singer Lloyd. One day, while working with the rapper Wale, Rembert got a call requesting he work on a magazine comer with an up-and-comer named Nicki Minaj. Shortly after, A$AP Rocky\u2019s people called. \u201cI knew who A$AP Rocky was,\u201d Rembert said. \u201cHe\u2019s a cool Harlem kid.\u201d On the set of that shoot, he was introduced to another new artist named Rita Ora, whom he ended up styling for seven years.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to work with someone who is authentically them,\u201d Rembert mused. \u201cI think it\u2019s important when you see certain moments in history with stylists and talent that will always be special. Law Roach and Zendaya, Brandon Maxwell and Lady Gaga, Mel Ottenberg and Rihanna. Man, it\u2019s just magic.\u201d\n\nRembert has a quick smile and a gentle wit; he\u2019s not a rabble rouser who will call out problems in the industry, but he does want to champion inclusion through his visibility. He worries that fashion people can \u201cget in their bubbles.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to look outside of who you are,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of times I see some of the biggest brands and I look at their front row, and they don\u2019t have anyone who looks like the world. There\u2019s only one type of girl. That\u2019s not the world, and if you\u2019re not being a human first and looking at the world as a human, then I don\u2019t care to support you.\u201d\n\nRembert made the \u201cleap of faith\u201d into designing clothes last year, though he had been mulling over the project for two years before that. \u201cYou know when someone texts you, and you respond to the text in your head, but you never actually respond to the text? That was me with deciding to design,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my head, I responded; \u2018Yes, man I\u2019m doing it, it\u2019s going to get done.\u2019 But it took until February 2018.\u201d\n\nHe first wanted to design menswear, and thought about making all the samples in his size 38 pants. But he was drawn to women\u2019s textiles and silhouettes, and wanted to champion the \u201cunapologetic\u201d femininity he sees in his daughter.\n\nRembert had already given Harper the middle name Ali\u00e9tte, after his mother, who was known by most as Weezy. \u201cMy grandmother gave all of her daughters French middle names that start with A, because my family is from Martinique,\u201d he explained. \u201cI loved that name when I was younger, but no one ever called my mother that.\u201d\n\nWorking with a team of two outside of a design studio in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, Rembert also enlists his partner, Brittany, for help with \u201cevery single thing.\u201d His pieces are made in a factory in New York, and he spoke to The Daily Beast the day before he was scheduled to finish his spring collection.\n\n\u201c You can get the cheapest dress and tailor it so it looks expensive, but the couture dress with bad tailoring is always going to look cheap \u201d\n\nFinishing touches for the runway show included casting models, consulting with his hair and makeup teams, settling on what music will play, and making sure his tailoring was on point. \u201cThat\u2019s the most important thing about styling,\u201d Rembert said. \u201cYou can get the cheapest dress and tailor it so it looks expensive, but the couture dress with bad tailoring is always going to look cheap.\u201d\n\nRembert\u2019s mother passed away at the beginning of his career. \u201cShe got to see me style Nicki Minaj, which was cool,\u201d he remembered. Six months before her death, Rembert picked out her outfits for a family trip.\n\n\u201cMore than anything, this show is about her,\u201d Rembert said of his spring collection. \u201cAnd it\u2019s about women, honestly, being themselves. Everything my mom did in life, she did with excellence. For me, a lot of times women are told they can only be a homemaker, or only a mother, or only someone\u2019s wife. But no, she can be whatever the hell she wants, and she can be better than you are at doing it.\u201d", "description": "Jason Rembert has styled some of fashion\u2019s biggest risk-takers.
