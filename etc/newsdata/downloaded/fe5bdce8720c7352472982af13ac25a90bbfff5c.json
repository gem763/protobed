Beaten New Zealand in a World Cup semi-final so comprehensively the men in black went a whiter shade of pale at the horror of it all.\n\nYet in the glorious aftermath it was as much as they could do to raise a smile.\n\n\u201cThe feeling now is that we\u2019ve given ourselves an opportunity,\u201d said fly-half George Ford. \u201cThat is literally all it is. We\u2019ve got one opportunity now to finish it off. We want to enjoy the win, but we understand what is ahead of us.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nStraight after the game Eddie Jones walked into the England changing room and addressed the squad.\n\n\u201cIt was: \u2018well done, good win\u2019,\u201d said Ford. \u201cHe said he was proud of us\u2026 \u2018now let\u2019s crack on to this week\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe are over the moon with the win but genuinely, and this is not faking it in any way, the feeling across the players is we want to finish this off.\u201d\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nThis is a far cry from 1997 when England were lampooned for doing a lap of honour at Old Trafford after being hammered by the All Blacks.\n\nCall it the Eddie effect.\n\nFrom the moment Jones took charge he focused the players on 2 November 2019. He told them that would be the day England would become the best team in the world. Sign up or ship out.\n\nEverything else has been been merely a stepping stone to that goal, even this: eliminating the two-time defending champions with as perfect a display as you could ever see on a rugby field.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\u201cAt the start of the week Eddie wanted us to rewrite history,\u201d said Billy Vunipola. \u201cWe have gone one step towards doing that. Now we have another game.\u201d\n\nThis remarkable sense of calm, of existing in the moment, served England well at Yokohama Stadium where, in Ford\u2019s words, \u201cwe knew we were not able to switch off for one second\u201d.\n\nThey had two tries disallowed, momentum swings which would have rocked lesser sides, yet simply came back harder.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nEven when they made their only real mistake of the game, a lineout malfunction that gifted New Zealand their only points, there was no dialling down of spirit.\n\n\u201cIt was incredibly calm behind the posts,\u201d said Ford. \u201cAnd that was massive for us to be honest. At that stage of the game, to give a try away\u2026 but we were thinking \u2018what\u2019s next?\u2019\n\n\u201cWe went down the other end and got three points, which is exactly how you want to respond.\u201d\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nThis has not just happened because Jones has decreed it. It has taken an inordinate amount of work by all concerned. It was only in March that England blew a 31-0 lead against Scotland.\n\n\u201cHaving some structures and systems in place to calm everyone down and get some messages across has massively benefitted everyone,\u201d Ford admitted. \u201cWe\u2019re still working on it every day.\"\n\n(Image: AFLO/Press Association Images)\n\nAnd so England move forward to the next match. One step from immortality was how it was put to Jones.\n\n\u201cIt's another week for us,\u201d came the straight reply. \u201cThat talk is for you guys. Enjoy it, because you won't be getting anything from us.\"\n\nENGLAND - Try: Tuilagi. Con: Farrell. Pen: Ford 4.\n\nNEW ZEALAND - Try: Savea. Con: Mo\u2019unga.", "description": "\u201cThe feeling now is that we\u2019ve given ourselves an opportunity. That is literally all it is. We\u2019ve got one opportunity now to finish it off.
