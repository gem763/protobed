Maguire was troubled by Crystal Palace in United\u2019s last match, and conceded a rash penalty on England duty against Kosovo.\n\nHe will need to put those displays behind him as he faces former club Leicester at Old Trafford. It will certainly be interesting to see how Maguire deals with the pace of ex-teammate Jamie Vardy.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Liverpool The most popular set of kits in the country. Liverpool FC via Getty Images\n\n3) Two up top\n\nIn the \u2018modern age\u2019 of football, teams have usually strayed away from tactical set-ups that employ two strikers, typically opting for an extra central midfielder or centre-back instead. Sheffield United and Southampton are two sides that are bucking that trend, with Chris Wilder opting for a 3-4-1-2 formation and Ralph Hasenhuttl more recently going with a 4-2-2-2 system.\n\nThe Blades\u2019 overlapping centre-backs have been an intriguing watch so far this season, with Jack O\u2019Connell and Chris Basham in particular taking up high and wide positions, often leaving John Egan isolated at the back.\n\nHasenhuttl\u2019s approach is more of a throwback, with the \u2018big man/little man\u2019 combination of Che Adams and Danny Ings operating up top, two wingers, and two central midfielders in front of a back four. The Saints may look to hit United on the counter away from home, with the pace of Ings and Moussa Djenepo capable of penetrating any spaces in behind.\n\n4) Barnes with a point to prove\n\nThere were more than a few people suggesting that Ashley Barnes can consider himself unlucky not to have received an England call-up after he carried his strong 2018/19 form into the opening four games of this campaign. Only Sergio Aguero, Mane and Vardy have scored more than Barnes\u2019 13 Premier League goals in 2019 (equal with Raheem Sterling), yet Gareth Southgate opted for Callum Wilson as England\u2019s third choice striker behind Harry Kane and Marcus Rashford.\n\nBarnes is approaching his 30th birthday, but it seems slightly unfair to ignore his remarkable goal record and the fact that he is far from a target man \u2013 unlike others such as Rickie Lambert and Kevin Davies. who received their first caps relatively late in their careers. When the Clarets take on Brighton at the Amex, Barnes may be playing with a bit of extra hunger to prove himself to Southgate and his doubters.\n\n5) Top six-pointer\n\nIn their opening four games of the season, Chelsea have so far failed to keep a clean sheet, and have conceded the second-most goals (nine) in the league. With their transfer ban, Chelsea were unable to sign any players, and as a result many have earmarked their place in the top six as there for the taking. They face a Wolves side at Molineux who have been touted as one of the teams to take their spot, despite a winless start to the season that has seen Nuno Espirito Santo\u2019s side pick up three draws and a loss.\n\nSanto has historically favoured a small squad at Wolves, but this may prove to be their undoing as they embark on a season in the Europa League after beating Torino to qualify for the group stage. A home game against Chelsea, with a mostly rested squad after the international break, is the perfect opportunity for Wolves to show that they can break the top-six axis. On the other hand, the fixture is a chance for Frank Lampard to show that his Chelsea side can compete with those around them after an embarrassing 4-0 defeat to Man United on the opening weekend.\n\n6) Spurs struggles\n\nTottenham Hotspur are another side who have yet to keep a clean sheet this season. Granted, they have played Arsenal and Manchester City away, but you would have expected them to be more solid at home against Aston Villa, where they conceded the first goal despite winning 3-1, and Newcastle, where they lost 1-0.\n\nDavinson Sanchez played alongside Toby Alderweireld in the first three games of the season before being shifted to right-back in the 2-2 draw at the Emirates, and the Colombian has looked untrustworthy in all four games.\n\nMauricio Pochettino will hope that Jan Vertonghen, recently restored against Arsenal, and compatriot Alderweireld can replicate their Belgium form and improve a defence that has conceded 46 goal attempts in the box \u2013 only Norwich (47) have conceded more.\n\n7) The Unstoppable Force\n\nManchester City have so far scored 14 goals in four games \u2013 no side has scored more. They were also top scorers last season with 95 and the season before that with 106. They boast an embarrassment of riches in attacking areas, with the likes of Gabriel Jesus and Riyad Mahrez regularly having to make do with substitute appearances.\n\nOn top of that, Aguero and David Silva were fully rested during the international break, a daunting prospect for Norwich, their opponents this weekend.\n\nTo make matters worse for the Canaries, they have the worst defence in the league with 10 goals shipped in four games \u2013 albeit having faced Liverpool and Chelsea. Fantasy football managers with Man City attacking assets will be licking their lips at the prospect of this fixture.\n\n8) Kean to score\n\nAlthough he is just 19, much is expected of Moise Kean at Everton after his \u00a325 million move from Juventus, with the Italian international seen by many as the Toffees\u2019 first-choice striker ahead of Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Cenk Tosun. Marco Silva has eased him into the Everton side, with Kean making substitute appearances in Everton\u2019s first three games before finally being afforded a start in the 3-2 win over Wolves.\n\nAlthough he has shown flashes of ability, the teenager has looked like a player still adjusting to a new environment, which is perfectly understandable. As a striker, however, he will be keen to get his first goal against on Sunday against Bournemouth after an impressive six goals and one assist in just 533 Serie A minutes last season.\n\n9) The Return of Quique\u200b\n\nAfter winning just one point from four games, Watford were the first side to pull the trigger this season and sacked Javi Gracia during the international break. They replaced him Quique Sanchez Flores, who took charge of Watford in their first season back in the top flight in 2015/16 and guided them to 13th place and an FA Cup semi-final, before being replaced by Walter Mazzarri. Watford\u2019s first game under their manager will not be easy, with Arsenal the visitors on Sunday.\n\n10) The Battle of Claret and Blue\n\nThe biggest claret and blue clubs in England are without doubt Aston Villa and West Ham (sorry, Burnley fans), and they will face each other for the first time since February 2016 in Monday night\u2019s fixture. The sides have enjoyed contrasting fortunes so far this season, with Villa picking up just three points and sitting in 18th, whilst West Ham have seven points and are in seventh place.\n\nDean Smith\u2019s side have played some nice football against the likes of Everton, Bournemouth and Spurs, but nice football by no means translates to points. Villa have conceded 77 shots this year, the most in the league, and need to improve defensively. West Ham will be looking to show they could be rank outsiders for a top-six charge with no real expectations on them this season.", "description": "1) Friends again? The early kick-off on Saturday between Liverpool\u00a0and Newcastle\u00a0will be the first time that Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah have played together since Mane exploded on the Liverpool bench against Burnley\u00a0\u2013 due to Salah\u2019s consistent refusal to pass him the ball in promising positions.
