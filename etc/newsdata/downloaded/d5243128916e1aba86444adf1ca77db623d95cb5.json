Cisgender men were categorised accurately 97.6 per cent of the time.", "description": "Facial recognition software is unable to recognise trans people, a university study has suggested.", "authors": ["Gabriella Swerling", "Social Affairs Editor", "Allister Heath", "David Goodhart", "Judith Woods"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/09/05/TELEMMGLPICT000206577886-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
