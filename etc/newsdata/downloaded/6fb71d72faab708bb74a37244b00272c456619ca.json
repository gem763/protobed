Unfortunately, the story isn\u2019t over, because Kavanaugh is about to get raked over the coals again in a new book by Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin, who offered up a sample in the New York Times \u2014 a taste the Times was happy to promote with tweet after tweet after tweet:\n\n\u2018They invite you to the game, but they never show you the rules or where the equipment is.\u2019 Our window into why Deborah Ramirez\u2019s experience with Brett Kavanaugh was so formative \u2066@katekelly\u2069 https://t.co/tKGI6Q5u86 \u2014 Robin Pogrebin (@rpogrebin) September 14, 2019\n\n\u201cBrett Kavanaugh fit in with the privileged kids.

Is this like when Christine Blasey Ford couldn\u2019t find anyone to back up her testimony \u2014 because that was enraging from the perspective of due process.\n\n\"During his Senate testimony, Kavanaugh said that if the incident Ramirez described had occurred, it would have been 'the talk of campus.'

There was a report that Christine Blasey-Ford\u2019s father didn\u2019t believe her story and suddenly the NYT brings up another bogus accusation. It even includes the word \u201ccorroboration\u201d being used incorrectly again. \u2014 RBe (@RBPundit) September 15, 2019\n\nThe story hasn\u2019t been corroborated. The only thing they confirmed was that someone made an unsubstantiated accusation.
