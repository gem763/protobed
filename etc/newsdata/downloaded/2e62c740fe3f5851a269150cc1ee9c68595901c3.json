I decided to use my credit card whenever possible, and only use cash when I didn't have a choice.\n\nGood plan, right? As I learned when I got back, not quite. I didn't realize that my basic student credit card, and, in fact, many popular mainstream credit cards, charged foreign transaction fees. I was hit with a 3% fee on every single transaction I made.\n\nSince then, I've learned that while many consumer credit cards have foreign transaction fees, many other popular cards don't. These days when I travel, I make sure that the cards I bring don't have the fees, and \u2014 unless I'm in a country or area where cash is particularly preferred \u2014 I put most of my spending on the card without coming home to surprise charges.\n\nHere are some of the best consumer credit cards that don't have foreign transaction fees. While there are other cards, too, that waive foreign transaction fees, these are some of our favorites based on the rewards and other benefits they offer, as well as the value they provide compared to their annual fees.\n\nKeep in mind that we're focusing on the rewards and perks that make these two cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which can far outweigh the value of any rewards.\n\nWhen you're working to earn credit-card rewards, it's important to practice financial discipline, like paying your balances off in full each month, making payments on time, and not spending more than you can afford to pay back. Basically, treat your credit card like a debit card.\n\nAnnual fee: $95\n\nOne of the most popular and recommended travel rewards credit cards, the Chase Sapphire Preferred offers 2 points per dollar spent on dining and travel, including internationally. Dining includes things like restaurants, bars, pubs, coffee shops, and more, while travel includes airfare, hotels, Airbnb, taxis, ride-share services like Uber and Lyft, subways, and more.\n\nRight now, the Chase Sapphire Preferred also offers a sign-up bonus of 60,000 points when you spend $4,000 in the first three months.\n\nRead more: Chase Sapphire Preferred review \u2014 one of the best travel cards for beginners\n\nAnnual fee: $450\n\nThe Sapphire Reserve is essentially a beefed-up version of the Preferred, with a higher annual fee and a few key differences. You get a $300 statement credit each cardmember year to cover your first $300 of travel charges, and a higher earning rate of 3x points on travel and dining purchases.\n\nThe Sapphire Reserve earns a bonus of 50,000 points when you spend $4,000 in the first three months.\n\nRead more: Chase Sapphire Reserve card review\n\nAmerican Express/Instagram\n\nAnnual fee: $550\n\nThe Platinum Card is more or less the flagship premium travel card, offering rewards, perks, and benefits that can net a ton of value for travelers \u2014 for instance, I got more than $2,000 from the card my first year with it. That's more than enough to make up for its hefty $550 annual fee.\n\nThe US version of the card has no foreign transaction fees and earns 5x points on flights booked directly with the airline and prepaid hotels booked through Amex Travel, on top of a welcome offer of 60,000 points when you spend $5,000 in the first three months. You'll also get up to a $200 annual airline fee credit, up to $200 of credits for Uber each cardmember year, access to more than 1,200 airport lounges around the world, complimentary elite status at major hotel chains, and more.\n\nRead more: Active-duty military members can get the Amex Platinum with no annual fee\n\nMajor airline credit cards\n\nDavid Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nThe mainstream credit cards from the three major US airlines\u2014 Delta, United, and American \u2014 all come with similar perks, including variations of priority boarding, free checked bags, the opportunity to earn miles on everyday purchases, and more. Plus, the cards have no foreign transaction fees.\n\nThe best optio for you depends on where you live and which airlines you have access to. The cards each come with different new member offers, and while there are a few other differences between them, they have annual fees of $95 to $99 that are waived the first year.\n\nAnnual fee: $0\n\nThe Wells Fargo Propel Amex is the rare credit card that waives foreign transaction fees and doesn't even charge an annual fee.\n\nIt also earns bonus cash back in lots of categories: You'll get 3x points (3% cash back) on eating out and ordering in, on travel, on gas stations, ride shares, and transit, and on popular streaming services (and 1 point per dollar on everything else).\n\nRead more: Wells Fargo Propel Amex card review\n\nIsabelle Raphael/The Points Guy\n\nAnnual fee: $95 (waived the first year)\n\nThis is another great option without foreign transaction fees and with an annual fee under $100, especially now that you can transfer miles to various airline programs. The Venture card earns 10x miles on paid hotels booked at hotels.com/venture, and 2 miles per dollar on everything else.\n\nThe card's currently offering a sign-up bonus of 50,000 miles after you spend $3,000 in the first three months. In addition to transferring miles to airlines, you can use them to wipe travel charges from your credit card statement.\n\nRead more: Capital One Venture card review", "description": "If you're traveling abroad, make sure you bring a credit card that waives foreign transaction fees to avoid extra charges.
