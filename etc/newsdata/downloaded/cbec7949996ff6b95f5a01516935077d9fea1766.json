In talks with Trump's top negotiator, the Taliban have promised not to allow Afghanistan to become a safe haven for al-Qaida or other extremist groups, such as the Islamic State.\n\nBut skeptics have said the Taliban, itself a militant Islamic group that harbored Osama bin Laden before the 9/11 attacks, cannot be trusted.\n\n\"Camp David is where America\u2019s leaders met to plan our response after al Qaeda, supported by the Taliban, killed 3000 Americans on 9/11,\" Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., tweeted on Sunday. \"No member of the Taliban should set foot there. Ever. The Taliban still harbors al Qaeda.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. More\n\nPompeo acknowledged that Camp David has \"a long history, an important history,\" as he put it in an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" But \"it's also had an important role in complex peace negotiations, sometimes with some pretty bad actors,\" he said.\n\nThe secretary of state said the negotiations, led by U.S. special representative Zalmay Khalilzad, had made \"real progress.\" Khalilzad announced a framework agreement with the Taliban last Monday. Under that deal, the U.S. would withdraw more than 5,400 of its 14,000 troops in Afghanistan over the next five months if the Taliban reduced its attacks and met other conditions.\n\n\"We are in the midst of an agreement that will reduce tyranny and open it up to Afghans to sit back and talk about a dignified and sustainable peace,\" Khalilzad tweeted after his ninth round of talks with the Taliban.\n\nIn an interview Sunday with Fox News, Pompeo said the administration has now recalled Khalilzad, who has been briefing the U.S.-backed Afghan government.\n\nPompeo initially seemed to defend the emerging deal, saying the U.S. had \"delivered\" on its mission in Afghanistan after 18 deadly years of conflict. But on Sunday, he said there was more work to do and the U.S. would not enter into any deal unless the Taliban proved it was acting in good faith.\n\nAsked on Fox News if the talks are \"dead,\" Pompeo said, \"For the time being, they are.\"\n\nThe Taliban said Trump's decision \u2013 which stunned lawmakers and foreign policy experts \u2013 would lead to more violence.\n\n\"The Americans will suffer more than anyone else for canceling the talks,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement, according to Reuters.\n\nUncertainty now surrounds Trump's hopes to fulfill a campaign promise to end America's longest war and bring U.S. troops home from Afghanistan. And he now faces blowback across the political spectrum for his plans to meet secretly with the Taliban, which allowed al-Qaida to flourish inside the Afghanistan and plot the 9/11 attacks on the U.S.", "description": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended President Trump's secret plan to invite Taliban leaders to Camp David.
