The good news is that young people are already engaged \u2013 the students taking part in climate strikes show that young people want action and are willing to skip school to show how serious they are. But while in class, children shouldn\u2019t feel their time is wasted. Primary school teachers have an ethical responsibility to bring climate change into their classrooms and they\u2019re well placed for the task.\n\nImagining a climate change curriculum is no mean feat. How to cover the range, scale and scope of the climate emergency? From the global effects on Earth\u2019s biodiversity to the human sources of greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 climate change will dominate the future of today\u2019s children and reshape every aspect of their lives.\n\nThen there\u2019s the biggest question of all \u2013 what are we going to do about it? This seems to animate children more than the adults in power, and the free imaginations we usually attribute to children are needed to remake the world in light of the climate crisis. A key task of educators in the 21st century is to make such abstract concepts tangible.\n\nSpringboard stories\n\nStorytelling offers a way through for the educator and every primary school teacher I\u2019ve ever met seems to have a gift for it. I saw how powerful storytelling could be when I worked at the Eden Project in Cornwall \u2013 the world\u2019s largest indoor rainforest. Here, visitors learn about the natural world while immersed in it.\n\nOne teacher told a story about ancient Polynesians who travelled the Pacific taking plants they grew with them to use for medicine, food and clothing. He explained to the school group that this led to the dispersal of plants \u2013 like coconut-carrying palms and bananas trees \u2013 all across islands in the Pacific. \u201cYour island is sinking,\u201d he told the children. \u201cYou\u2019re setting off to find new lands and changing your life. What plants would you take with you?\u201d\n\nWith that thought, the children wandered off amid Eden\u2019s rice plants, the banana and rubber trees that make tires and the periwinkles that cure childhood leukaemia.\n\nTheir lives might feel a million miles from those ancient travellers, but the dynamics are the same \u2013 we all rely on the natural world. It\u2019s not just something pretty to look at, it\u2019s vital for our survival. Stories can act as springboards that catapult young people into new ways of seeing, thinking and being in a constantly changing world.\n\nRead more: Environmental storytelling can help spread big ideas for saving the planet\n\nReading time\n\nEvery primary school should amass a climate change book shelf. This could inspire an enduring love of nature and begin to build familiarity with ecological terms and concepts. A good example is Rob McFarlane\u2019s Lost Words \u2013 something of a rescue mission for nature words that have been erased from the Oxford Junior Dictionary. The book introduces children to otters, conkers and kingfishers through poetry and beautiful paintings.\n\nBooks that deal more directly with environmental destruction and climate change are also needed. Lara Hawthorne\u2019s Alba, the hundred-year-old fish, tells the story of a beautiful coral reef that becomes a littered graveyard. Alba the fish gets stuck in a plastic bottle and is only saved by a little girl who recruits her community to clean up the ocean and release Alba.", "description": "By leading school children through the wonders of the natural world, teachers could help raise environmental stewards.", "authors": ["Ria Dunkley", "Lecturer In Geography", "Environment", "Sustainability", "University Of Glasgow"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4sVMHzjCeveQRF3m_n20Lg--~B/aD0zMzA7dz00OTY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_conversation_464/87b79927c875a79256250655e6a179ae", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
