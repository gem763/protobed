The guards protecting Pence got back up from a police force that only allows elite \u201cViking SWAT\u201d members carry guns.\n\nIcelandic authorities gave U.S. personnel special permission to carry firearms. Bomb-sniffing dogs were cleared to enter the country because of a strict quarantine for imported animals.\n\nPence is the first U.S. vice president to visit Iceland, a country of just 350,000 people, since George H.W. Bush came to Reykjavik in 1983.\n\nThe Reykjavik Metropolitan Police requested backup from police stations in neighboring towns and villages to meet U.S. manpower standards.\n\n\u201cThis is incredibly expensive,\u201d Police Chief Asgeir Asgeirsson told the Morgunbladid daily newspaper.\n\nBut Helgi Hafsteinsson, an employee at a gas station in Keflavik, welcomed the heavy traffic caused by Pence\u2019s visit.\n\n\u201cIt is great for business,\u201d he said.\n\nBefore Pence\u2019s arrival, U.S. Secret Service personnel spent weeks scouting locations. Icelandic President Gudni Th. Johannesson travels unaccompanied on private errands and is often spotted in a geothermal bath popular with locals.\n\nAll the moving parts required for the president\u2019s safety tied up transportation in the capital. Police closed off main roads to accommodate the convoy that drove from the airport to Reykjavik.\n\nDrivers lamented the traffic on social media. Satirical newspaper Fr\u00e9ttirnar mocked that \u201cAmericans intended to give every Reykjavik citizen a paralyzing drug during Pence\u2019s visit.\u201d\n\nHelicopters hovered over the government building where Pence met with Icelandic eland\u2019s officials as snipers perched on neighboring rooftops.\n\nAhead of Pence\u2019s arrival, three CV-22B Osprey flew over southwestern Iceland, along with two C-130 Hercules and one Lockheed C-5 Galaxy.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "U.S. Vice President Mike Pence's arrival in Iceland with military jets and armed personnel set eyes popping Wednesday in a nation consistently ranked as the world's most peaceful.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Egill Bjarnason"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/03/Ireland_US_04545.jpg-94d67_c0-199-1654-1163_s1770x1032.jpg?70def716f006016d31ca0871c69bfd140068de00"}
