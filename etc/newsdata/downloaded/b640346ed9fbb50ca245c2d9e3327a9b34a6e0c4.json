Lewandowski missed the rebound with the goal at his mercy, but finally struck after the visitors failed to clear.\n\nTottenham drew 2-2 at Olympiakos in the other Group B game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Bayern Munich substitute Thomas M\u00fcller provided a late highlight as the German powerhouse beat Red Star Belgrade 3-0 in their Champions League opener on Wednesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/germany_soccer_champions_league_43564_c0-125-3309-2054_s1770x1032.jpg?1668d1e1b4ef4dcd523ef00ace87412c0fb7a450", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
