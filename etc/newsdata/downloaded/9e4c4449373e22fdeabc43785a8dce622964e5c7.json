Israel's leading Arab politician was referring to Sunday's announcement that the Joint List, an alliance of Arab parties that he heads, would recommend Benny Gantz as the next Israeli Prime Minister.\n\nIt is only the second time in Israel's history that Arab parties have given such a recommendation after an election -- normally they do not signal a preference. The only other time they did so was in 1992, when they offered backing for Yitzhak Rabin, who had promised to pursue peace with the Palestinians if elected.\n\nThe Arab parties stayed out of the coalition Rabin formed, but offered their support in key votes in Parliament. This time, too, the Joint List said its support for Gantz would not extend to joining him in government. Instead, it would back Gantz to stop the country's longest-serving Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, from retaking office. Writing in the New York Times , Odeh laid out his position.\n\n\"On behalf of the Joint List, I am recommending that Israel's president choose Benny Gantz, the leader of the centrist Blue and White party, to be the next Prime Minister. This will be the most significant step toward helping create the majority needed to prevent another term for Mr. Netanyahu. And it should be the end of his political career. My colleagues and I have made this decision not as an endorsement of Mr. Gantz and his policy proposals for the country. We are aware that Mr. Gantz has refused to commit to our legitimate political demands for a shared future, and because of that we will not join his government,\" he wrote.\n\nThe reaction was swift and, in many cases, predictable. Netanyahu's Likud Party, which came second to Blue and White in last week's election, reprised its message from the campaign trail.\n\nRead More", "description": "Ayman Odeh said it was possibly the most difficult decision of his life.
