They rely on our infrastructure, our expertise and our sales, so they must pay their fair share into society. Still outrageous.\u201d\n\nThe challenge of taxing global digital companies, such as Facebook, Amazon and Google, is particularly acute as they do not need to be physically present in a country to sell their services there. Existing international tax rules, dating back to the 1920s, mean companies can be taxed only in countries where they have a physical presence.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development published a proposal that would break with that principle by requiring companies to pay tax wherever they have \u201csignificant consumer-facing activities\u201d and generate their profits, whether or not they are located there.\n\nArun Birla, tax partner at law firm Paul Hastings, welcomed the proposal, noting the current global push \u201cfor equitable international taxation rights and combatting aggressive tax avoidance through profit shifting\u201d.\n\nSteve Hatch, vice-president for Northern Europe at Facebook, said: \u201cThe UK is now one of Facebook\u2019s most important hubs for global innovation. We continue to grow and invest heavily in the UK and by the end of the year we\u2019ll employ 3,000 people here. These high-skilled jobs are not only working on products like WhatsApp and Workplace but also help develop technology to proactively detect and remove malicious content from our platforms. Businesses across the country use our platforms to grow, and revenue from customers supported by our UK teams is now recorded here so that any taxable profit is subject to UK corporation tax.\u201d", "description": "Facebook paid only \u00a328.5m in tax in Britain last year, according to freshly released accounts that have baffled experts and drawn fire from a prominent tax campaigner.
