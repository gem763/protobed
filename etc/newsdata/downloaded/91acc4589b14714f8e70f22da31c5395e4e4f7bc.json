USA TODAY\n\nThroughout the offseason, whenever anyone talked hopefully about Oklahoma\u2019s defense, Alex Grinch stopped the conversation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a results business,\u201d the new defensive coordinator would tell people. \u201cThere\u2019s a scoreboard. It counts.\u201d\n\nFive games in, Grinch and the Sooners have delivered. There are results to back the claims that this defense is different. But this week brings a different challenge \u2013 and takes us back to the reason Grinch was hired.\n\nBefore No. 5 Oklahoma takes on No. 11 Texas in the annual clash in the Cotton Bowl, let\u2019s flash back to what happened a year ago, and an epic defensive debacle.\n\nOklahoma's defense swarms to tackle UCLA running back Joshua Kelley during their game on Sept. 14, 2019 at the Rose Bowl. (Photo: Kelvin Kuo, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nNever mind Texas receivers running free, or Sam Ehlinger running whenever he wanted, or the Longhorns running up more points than ever before in a historic rivalry. On a day of defensive futility, in a season filled with more of the same, one play captured it all.\n\nThird quarter, Texas leading by a touchdown, facing third-and-21 near midfield: Ehlinger threw to Lil\u2019Jordan Humphrey, who caught the ball near the line of scrimmage. And then the big wide receiver rumbled downfield, dragging several Oklahoma players for a ride. It eventually took eight Sooners to bring him down, and not until he had gained 19 yards. The Longhorns would convert on fourth down and soon score a touchdown to take a 14-point lead.\n\nPOWER RANKINGS: ACC | Big 12 | Big Ten | Pac-12 | SEC\n\nUNLIKELY LEADER: Trask leads No. 7 Florida after not starting in high school\n\nBOWL PROJECTIONS: Ohio State now No. 1 seed for College Football Playoff\n\nThe astounding sequence illustrated an astonishingly bad performance. And as much as anything else, the failure against Texas is why Grinch is in Norman, making $1.4 million a year.\n\nIt\u2019s about more than one game, sure. Oklahoma\u2019s defense was routinely awful in 2018. The objective is not simply to beat Texas, but to win a national championship \u2013 and in recent years, that porous defense has stopped the Sooners short of the goal.\n\nBut a year ago, that historically ghastly performance prompted Lincoln Riley to take drastic action.\n\nIn winning 48-45, Texas piled up 501 yards, an average of 6.7 yards per play. The next day, longtime defensive coordinator Mike Stoops was out, fired at midseason. A few months later Grinch was in, hired to fix the problem.\n\nWhen the Sooners and Longhorns meet in one of college football\u2019s grandest spectacles \u2013 the old stadium divided again into horseshoes of crimson and burnt orange, with the State Fair of Texas in full swing just beyond \u2013 we\u2019ll find out whether he has.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to play defense in 2019,\u201d Grinch told USA TODAY Sports back in August. \u201cYou\u2019re one play away from being average.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, the Sooners would have embraced average. They ranked 114th nationally in total defense \u2013 worst in school history \u2013 and dead last (129th) in passing yards allowed. And yet on one Saturday in October, they\u2019d have survived something slightly better than shockingly bad.\n\nInstead Texas held the ball for 34 minutes. Notched 27 first downs. Scored on all five possessions in the red zone. Those same \u2018Horns had managed one offensive touchdown a week earlier in a 19-14 win at Kansas State.\n\nYeah, Oklahoma avenged the loss in the Big 12 championship game, and even made a couple of defensive plays along the way. A fantastic offense was good enough, again, to get the Sooners into the College Football Playoff. But a shootout with Alabama fizzled because while the Crimson Tide could not contain Kyler Murray after the first couple of possessions, Oklahoma had zero shot at slowing \u2018Bama at virtually any point.\n\nEnter Grinch, who promised accountability and attitude would be followed by action. The early returns are good. Statistically, Oklahoma has vaulted in the national rankings from near the bottom to very respectable. And here\u2019s one seemingly important measurement, given that embarrassing play when Humphrey dragged defenders like a dad dominating third-graders: OU ranks No. 5 in third-down defense, allowing conversions on only 24.6 percent of attempts.\n\nThe Sooners are several plays better than average. They have displayed aggression and desire \u2013 if it sounds like a backhanded compliment, maybe it is. It\u2019s also an evident change.\n\nBut the competition - Houston, South Dakota, UCLA, Texas Tech and Kansas - has been squeezably soft, making actual improvement difficult to measure. That changes in the Cotton Bowl.\n\nEhlinger is completing almost 70 percent of his passes and averaging 337 yards. The Longhorns average 42 points. Compared to its production heading into the 2018 regular-season meeting with Oklahoma, this Texas offense packs a lot more punch.\n\nThe Sooners believe their defense does, too.\n\n\u201cYou feel a lot of progress and excitement about what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Riley told reporters last week, after a win at Kansas. \u201cI love how we\u2019re flying to the football, how we\u2019re hitting. The fun thing is, we\u2019re still so early in this deal.\u201d\n\nBig picture, he\u2019s correct. But Saturday, the Sooners return to the scene of an astonishing failure, the most vivid illustration of just how bad their defense could be.\n\n\u201cThey gave us a long day in the Cotton Bowl last year,\u201d Oklahoma defensive end Ronnie Perkins told the Tulsa World. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely one of those weeks where you come out and prove yourselves, that last year was a fluke defensive-wise. \u2026 We\u2019re not that type of defense anymore.\u201d\n\nPreventing another Red River shootout would go a long way to proving the claim.", "description": "Oklahoma's maligned defense made changes with hire of coordinator Alex Grinch.
