Facebook, which that day had sent us a letter threatening legal action if we published, had issued a press release saying it had kicked Cambridge Analytica off its platform.\n\nIt was a last-gasp attempt to get ahead of a story that Facebook knew was set to break. But it was too late. We worked through the night, brought forward our publishing time, and then the story was out there.\n\nIf this seems like ancient history, it isn\u2019t. Because last week Mark Zuckerberg appeared before the US Congress\u2019s House financial services committee to talk about Facebook\u2019s plans for its Libra cryptocurrency and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the congresswoman for New York\u2019s 14th district, got five minutes to grill him.\n\n\u201cMr Zuckerberg, I think you of all people can appreciate using a person\u2019s past behaviour in order to determine, make decisions or predict people\u2019s future behaviour, and in order for us to make decisions about Libra I think we need to kind of dig into your past behaviour and Facebook\u2019s past behaviour with respect to our democracy. Mr Zuckerberg, what year and month did you personally become aware of Cambridge Analytica?\u201d\n\nThe fact is that the Cambridge Analytica data scandal is far from over. In some ways, it\u2019s only just beginning\n\nWatching it on a small screen on my phone, I was on the edge of my seat. This was the question that I and a small group of super-nerds, which includes MPs such as Damian Collins and Ian Lucas, have been banging on about for more than a year. Because Zuckerberg last testified to Congress in April 2018 but so many more facts have come to light since. Facts that cast serious doubts over that testimony. Doubts that have opened up a serious question: did he lie on oath to Congress?\n\nThis is what Ocasio-Cortez was trying to dig into. \u201cI\u2019m not sure of the exact time,\u201d said Zuckerberg. \u201cBut it was probably around the time when it became public, I think it was around March of 2018, I could be wrong.\u201d\n\nThe problem for Zuckerberg is not that this defies common sense, though it does. It\u2019s that it opens up a whole new world of trouble for Facebook. To understand why, you need to go back to the four days that followed Facebook\u2019s legal threat to us and then its middle-of-the-night press release. Four days in which Facebook\u2019s stock market value plummeted more than $100bn and the company went into lockdown. When Zuckerberg finally emerged, a story was in place. The problem for him is that this has steadily been unravelling ever since.\n\nIn July this year, a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation revealed that employees knew that Cambridge Analytica, described as a \u201csketchy\u201d business, had been \u201cscraping\u201d Facebook data in 2015, before even the Guardian\u2019s first report.\n\nWhat about Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg? Ocasio-Cortez asked. When did she know? What about board member Peter Thiel? Zuckerberg drew a blank. His memory banks had nothing.\n\n\u201cThis was the largest data scandal with respect to your company that had catastrophic impacts with regard to 2016\u2026 and you don\u2019t know?\u201d asked Ocasio-Cortez.\n\n\u201cCongresswoman, we discussed it when we were aware of what happened.\u201d\n\nThe evidence continues to mount. And the answers Zuckerberg gave Ocasio-Cortez only invite further questions. The fact is that the Cambridge Analytica data scandal is far from over. In some ways, it\u2019s only just beginning. It\u2019s not the crime, as the saying goes, it\u2019s the cover-up. And that continues.\n\nBecause we know Facebook lied. The SEC investigation says that. To us at the Observer, in fact \u201c\u2026 when asked by reporters in 2017 about its investigation into the Cambridge Analytica matter, Facebook falsely claimed the company found no evidence of wrongdoing\u201d.\n\nOn 7 November, I will give evidence to the international grand committee of parliamentarians from nine countries who have banded together to try to get answers from Facebook. But Zuckerberg has again refused to give evidence to the representatives of countries numbering more than half a billion people.\n\nWe have to recognise that Facebook is a foreign company that operates beyond the reach of our laws and should be nowhere near our elections.\n\nI was in Tirana at a conference of data privacy commissioners from around the world when Ocasio-Cortez was grilling Zuckerberg. John Edwards, the commissioner for New Zealand, which since the Christchurch massacre has been taking the fight to the tech giants, likened it to \u201cbringing a pocket knife not to a gunfight but to a nuclear explosion\u201d.\n\nWe know our elections are unsafe. And until Facebook can prove it has fixed that, microtargeted political advertising based on unknown data from unknown sources should simply be banned.\n\nWe know Facebook\u2019s platform was used to subvert and undermine elections in the US, the UK and multiple other countries\n\nWe are at an extraordinary crossroads. We have sufficient information to know that Facebook\u2019s platform was used to subvert and undermine elections in the US, the UK and many other countries. But we pretend to be helpless to prevent it happening again. We\u2019re not. We\u2019re simply hamstrung by a government and an opposition that have chosen to ignore it. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s bold questions don\u2019t just show Zuckerberg up but Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn also.\n\nOur elections are not safe. And this month Facebook took the decision to make them even more unsafe. Just over a week after Zuckerberg held a closed-door meeting with Donald Trump, we discovered he\u2019d changed Facebook\u2019s policy to allow posts by politicians or parties containing \u201cdeceptive, false or misleading content\u201d. It\u2019s an extraordinary decision championed by Zuckerberg in a speech in which he said: \u201cI believe we must continue to stand for free expression.\u201d\n\nFacebook\u2019s global head of policy, Nick Clegg, who once railed against the \u201cblatant lies\u201d told in the European referendum, has now sanctioned their use in all political adverts in all elections in all countries across the world.\n\nWe\u2019re not helpless. Ocasio-Cortez shows us that. We are just being betrayed by our government and our opposition. \u201cWhy is this lying bastard lying to me?\u201d is a traditional approach to journalism. We in Britain should be asking: why are these lying politicians not taking action over this lying company that is allowing lying politicians to lie to me?", "description": "The New York politician has exposed the firm\u2019s shameless disregard for the truth", "authors": ["Carole Cadwalladr"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f498fda39ba0ca42dacc900f71be8882355732b/0_101_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=79c165775d0d16d7cc3959862211ea43", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
