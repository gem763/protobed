The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure. Getty\n\n\u201cThe way test results and patient history are interpreted by healthcare professionals can be subjective, and unconscious biases may influence the diagnosis,\u201d Dr Lee said.\n\n\u201cThis may partly explain why, even when rates of diagnosis are increased, women are still at a disadvantage when it comes to treatments they receive following a heart attack.\u201d\n\nDr Lee added that by \u201caddressing a biological difference between men and women\u201d, the team were able to \u201cdetect more women who\u2019ve had a heart attack\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis women would otherwise by misdiagnosed,\u201d the academic stated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now important that this blood test, with its specific measures for men and women, is used to guide treatment and that we address these disparities in the care of men and women with heart attack. Women everywhere should benefit from improved heart attack diagnosis.\u201d\n\nDr Sonya Babu-Narayan, cardiologist and associate medical director at the BHF, said that it is \u201cextremely promising\u201d that the use of high sensitivity troponin blood tests can improve diagnoses of heart attacks.\n\n\u201cBut this progress in diagnosis needs to translate into better treatment and improved heart attack survival chances for women,\u201d Dr Babu-Narayan said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essential that healthcare professionals are aware of the inequalities in heart care for women, and that everyone can spot the symptoms of a heart attack.\u201d\n\nDr Babu-Narayan added that with increased research and awareness can help to \u201cclose this heart attack gender gap\u201d.", "description": "Women who suffer from heart attacks are half as likely as men to receive the recommended medical treatment, a new study has claimed.
