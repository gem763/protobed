Let's get Brexit done \u2014 we can, we must, and we will.\"\n\nJohnson added that if the U.K. fails to get a Brexit deal because of what is \"essentially a technical discussion,\" then there is no doubt that Britain will leave without one.", "description": "The U.K. leader tells his party conference that it is time to get Britain out of the European Union.", "authors": ["David Reid"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106159953-1570014173116gettyimages-1173062883.jpeg?v=1570014208"}
