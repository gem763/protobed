None of the Zlochevsky-related cases has been revived yet, they said.\n\nThey did not specify how many, if any, were related to Hunter Biden\u2019s work at Burisma.\n\nRyaboshapka was mentioned in the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who assured Trump that Ryaboshapka was \u201chis man\u201d and that he would resume investigations into Burisma.\n\nThe prosecutor general insisted on Friday that he did not feel any pressure over the Burisma case.\n\n\u201cNot a single foreign or Ukrainian official or politician has called me or tried to influence my decisions regarding specific criminal cases,\u201d he said.\n\nA whistleblower last month revealed that Trump in a phone call asked Zelenskiy to resume the probe into Joe Biden and his son. The July 25 call has since triggered an impeachment inquiry against Trump.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Ukraine\u2019s prosecutors office is reviewing previously closed cases including ones involving the company Joe Biden's son worked for.", "authors": ["Yuras Karmanau"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ruslan-ryaboshapka.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
