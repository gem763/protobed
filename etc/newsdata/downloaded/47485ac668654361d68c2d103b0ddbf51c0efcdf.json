As we reported yesterday, he has discussed, inter alia, lavatory cisterns with listeners. Curiously, Miliband used to disapprove of MPs seeking additional employment. \u2018We\u2019ve got to settle the issue of MPs taking second jobs once and for all,\u2019 he declared in 2015.\n\nMinister for immigration Brandon Lewis waffles on BBC1 that President Donald Trump\u2019s visit can\u2019t be announced because dates have not been agreed. What nonsense. The Queen announced the 2018 Commonwealth Summit, although no date is set, and nor has the host UK city been agreed. If the Government was keen on a Trump visit it could have used the Queen\u2019s Speech to force his hand on dates. Trump might have enjoyed getting a name check in the Queen\u2019s Speech. This much-anticipated but tricky visit now seems to have been kicked into the long grass.\n\nFormer Labour leader (and current MP for Doncaster North) Ed Miliband missed yesterday\u2019s State Opening of Parliament to pursue his new, part-time career as a Radio 2 DJ\n\nComedy veteran John Cleese, 77, enthuses on Twitter: \u2018Delighted that Vince Cable is standing for the Lib Dem leadership.\u2019 A long-time party supporter, Cleese claims he turned down the offer of a peerage from former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown in 1999. \u2018Paddy was going to offer me one for political services,\u2019 he said. \u2018But I realised this involved being in England in the winter and I thought that was too much of a price to pay.\u2019 Perhaps he hopes Sir Vince will repeat the offer. There\u2019s no rule saying life peer comics can\u2019t winter abroad.\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s swift intervention, saving the Countess of Wessex from a bad fall as she tried to get out of a carriage at Ascot, sent a shiver down the spines of watching courtiers, who know Kate won\u2019t always be on hand to rescue toppling royals. \u2018Camilla finds it difficult to step out of carriages, particularly while wearing new shoes and an evening gown,\u2019 says my source. \u2018But at least she makes use of the helping hands offered by coachmen. The Queen will only accept help from Prince Philip.\u2019\n\n\u2018Camilla finds it difficult to step out of carriages, particularly while wearing new shoes and an evening gown,\u2019 says my source\n\nStanley Johnson, 76, Foreign Secretary Boris\u2019s lively, ex-MEP father, performs a handstand while promoting a More4 TV documentary on the joys and pitfalls of being elderly. Watched by another participant, ex-editor Eve Pollard, he duly performs this feat, coins from his pockets raining on to the floor. \u2018That was excellent!\u2019 comments well-built Ms Pollard, who, mercifully, isn\u2019t tempted to try this gymnastic move herself.\n\nDigby Jones, 61, a successful businessman and former head of the CBI, is dismissed by Labour shadow international business secretary Barry Gardiner as \u2018sitting on the sidelines\u2019 while discussing Brexit. The peer rounds on Gardiner, 60, on the BBC\u2019s Daily Politics, informing the political drone: \u2018You arrogantly say that people like me sit on the sidelines. We, the business community, pay your wages! We trade the world to pay the tax that builds schools and hospitals. We do not sit on the sidelines.\u2019", "description": "Ed Miliband (pictured) used to disapprove of MPs seeking additional employment. \u2018We\u2019ve got to settle the issue of MPs taking second jobs once and for all,\u2019 he declared in 2015.", "authors": ["Ephraim Hardcastle For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/22/01/419C1CFE00000578-0-image-a-28_1498089902066.jpg", "published_at": "2017-06-22"}
