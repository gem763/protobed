In Tunisia, we don\u2019t have the big oil reserves, [but] we have our brains.\u201d\n\nBUREAUCRACY STUNTING INNOVATION\n\nWalid Sultan Midani launched Digital Mania, an independent gaming company, eight years ago. The firm, which is expanding into creating games for Virtual Reality, has 128 games produced so far.\n\nVirtual Reality is a top trend in the tech industry\n\nWhen asked what is stifling start-up growth in Tunisia, Midani says that too much bureaucracy is to blame.\n\nHe adds that although people are pushed to launch start-ups in the country, they are not equipped with the same resources or tools as elsewhere in the world.\n\nLast year, the Tunisian government launched The Start-Up Act, a series of policies and reforms to develop the country\u2019s entrepreneurial and tech ecosystem.\n\nDespite these efforts, businesses like InstaDeep and Digital Mania have had to move their headquarters to Europe in order to expand and bypass red tape.\n\n\u201cThere is much talent here, but the barriers are just frustrating,\u201d says Midani. \u201cJust open the door and let the flow go, and you will see in two years something magnificent will happen here.\u201d", "description": "With more than one-third of Tunisia\u2019s graduates unemployed, many young nationals are taking matters into their own hands by creating their own tech companies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/21/05/56/1000x563_cmsv2_733f2d8d-4567-58af-963e-b6463798cbef-4210556.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
