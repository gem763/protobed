Yannick Bahati's family and friends certainly do, and Bahati (9-4 MMA, 0-1 BMMA) told MMA Junkie they were \u201cpetrified\u201d for him heading into the Bellator Europe 5 main event.\n\nBut Bahati, whose early years growing up in the Congo forced him to experiences some horrific times, has no issue with the Dutch knockout artist\u2019s heavy hands, and says he has the antidote.\n\nNow living and training in Birmingham, England, Bahati heads into the contest with the belief that his own striking could cause Manhoef (31-14-1 MMA, 3-3 BMMA) some problems. But his true key to victory lies on the mat, where \u201cThe Black Mamba\u201d should hold a significant grappling advantage.\n\nLike any fighter who steps into the cage to face Manhoef, task number 1 is to ensure the 43-year-old doesn\u2019t find a home for his sledgehammer punches. If Bahati can negotiate that aspect of the fight, the opportunity may be there to take \u201cNo Mercy\u201d to the canvas and take over.\n\nIf he can, the former BAMMA and EFC middleweight champion will have a major scalp on his record as he looks to make a serious dent in the Bellator light heavyweight division.", "description": "The Bellator cage travels to Milan, Italy for a special triple-card show at the Allianz Cloud.
