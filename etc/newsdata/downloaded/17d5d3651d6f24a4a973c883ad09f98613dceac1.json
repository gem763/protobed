People enhanced the image for a closer look at it and started claiming it looked like a plane flying into a tower.\n\n\"Did they fire all the stylists too or is Melania just the biggest troll ever??,\" one person commented.\n\nThis is clearly accidental, but that didn't stop people from commenting on it. Perhaps someone on the First Lady's staff should've noticed the stitching, but it seems a bit absurd to get worked up over it.\n\nWhen asked about it, White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham called the whole thing \"ridiculous.\"\n\nOne Twitter user pointed out that our brains allow us to see what we want to see. This was nothing more than an optical illusion that people are probably looking to much into.\n\nRelated:\n\nEveryone Thinks Melania Trump's 9/11 Coat Showed Plane Flying Into Tower\n\nResponse to Melania Trump's 'I Really Don't Care' Jacket Sells Out in One Hour, Proceeds Go to Charity\n\nMelania Trump Wears Coat With 'I Really Don't Care, Do U?'
