'So, we need to make sure that there is a place for their children to go so that they can continue doing what they need to do to support their families.'\n\nTalks are continuing Wednesday but Mayor Lori Lightfoot preemptively announced that classes on the following day would be canceled, saying she wanted to give parents more time to plan.\n\nA clearly frustrated Lightfoot said the city has not only offered a 16 percent pay raise over the 5-year contract, but the city has also agreed to put language in the contract that addresses 'enforceable targets' on class size and increasing staffing levels for positions such as nurses, librarians and social workers - items the union said were critical.\n\nMembers of the Chicago Teachers Union and SEIU Local 73 march through the Loop after a rally on Monday\n\nShe said the union's demands would cost an unaffordable $2.5 billion per year.\n\n'Without question, the deal we put on the table is the best in the Chicago Teachers union history,' said Lightfoot. 'Despite all this, the Chicago Teachers Union intends to forge ahead with a strike.'\n\nUnion leaders, though, disputed Lightfoot's characterization of the city's willingness to concede to their demands on several issues, including class sizes.\n\nWhat Chicago teachers strike means for the city's K-12 students All Thursday classes have been canceled throughout the school district District officials will keep all buildings open during school hours, staffed by principals and employees who usually work in administrative roles Breakfast and lunch will be served, but all after-school activities and school buses are suspended in the district Chicago's Shedd Aquarium is offering day camp programs for elementary school kids for $100 per day The Boys & Girls Club of Chicago is offering its own day camp program for a $20 annual membership fee The YMCA of Metro Chicago expects highest demand for its all-day programs for children between the ages of 5 and 12, who are too young to stay home alone City libraries, churches, and Safe Haven program community centers also are planning programs for students\n\n'CPS' current class size offer falls far short of what's needed to address the sweeping scale of the problem,' they said in a statement.\n\nLightfoot said the city agreed to make substantial changes on some of the union's top priorities, but its negotiators responded by issuing additional demands, including some she deemed unacceptable.\n\n'The union is still demanding to shorten instructional time by 30 minutes in the morning,' she said. 'We won't do that. We will not cheat our children out of instructional time.'\n\nBefore heading into a downtown law firm for bargaining talks Wednesday morning, union vice president Stacy Davis Gates said there is a 'gross disconnect' between Lightfoot's comments and what negotiators have put in writing.\n\n'To say that you have offered a proposal that respects what we are asking for, to say you've bent over backward .... it's absolutely ridiculous,' Davis Gates said.\n\nCommunity organizations have been preparing for days to welcome students, ranging from a $100 per day camp for elementary school kids at the Shedd Aquarium to all-day programs run by the Boys & Girls Club of Chicago and accessible for a $20 annual membership fee.\n\nMimi LeClair, president of the Boys & Girls Club of Chicago, said a strike is particularly difficult for single parents and those whose jobs have inflexible schedules.\n\n'It's a horrendous dilemma, deciding between likely losing their job or having their paycheck docked when they rely on every penny or leaving their children home alone,' LeClair said.\n\nThe city's public libraries also are planning programs for students, along with a network of churches and community centers that are part of the city's Safe Haven program intended to give kids a safe place during the summer months particularly on the city's south and west sides.\n\nThe YMCA of Metro Chicago expects highest demand for its all-day programs for children between the ages of 5 and 12, who are too young to stay home alone but whose parents may oppose sending them to schools un-staffed by teachers.\n\n'Real life still happens,' said Man-Yee Lee, a spokeswoman for the organization. 'Parents still need to go to work and their kids still need somewhere to go.'", "description": "Chicago Teachers Union confirmed Wednesday night that its 25,000 members would not return to classrooms Thursday.
