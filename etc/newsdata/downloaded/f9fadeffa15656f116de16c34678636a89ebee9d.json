Let's get down to business.\n\nAlfonso Ribeiro guest judged on Saturday evening's episode of \"Strictly Come Dancing,\" a UK celebrity ballroom dance competition, and everybody was hamming it up in his honor.\n\nIt's not unusual to see Ribeiro breaking it down on air or on stage. The actor is most famous for his role as Carlton Banks on the popular 90's series \"Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\"\n\nHis character may be well known for his dance moves, but so is Ribeiro. In 2014, he was the winner of season 19 of \"Dancing with the Stars,\" the US version of \"Strictly Come Dancing.\"\n\nTo anticipate Ribeiro's arrival, the show's stars shared a video of themselves doing the Carlton, the dance made famous by Ribeiro's \"Fresh Prince\" character. Of course, no Carlton tribute would be complete without the Tom Jones song, \"It's Not Unusual.\"\n\nThe night was full of tributes to Ribeiro.\n\nChoreographer Katya Jones and TV presenter Mike Bushell performed a samba to The Sugarhill Gang's \"Apache (Jump on It)\" a song famously featured in a performance by Ribeiro and his co-star Will Smith on \"Fresh Prince.\"\n\nWhen Alfonso's behind the Judges' desk, what else are you gonna dance to? \ud83d\ude02 Jump on it @mikebreakfast and @mrs_katjones \ud83e\udd73 #Strictly pic.twitter.com/vLFvUo3adH \u2014 BBC Strictly \u2728 (@bbcstrictly) October 19, 2019\n\nOf course, Alfonso couldn't go a whole night without whipping out his own dance moves. He got up from behind the judge's desk to teach Katya and Mike how it's really done.\n\nTerms and Conditions: You cannot vote for Alfonso tonight.#Strictly pic.twitter.com/2mTOLJw8m6 \u2014 BBC Strictly \u2728 (@bbcstrictly) October 19, 2019", "description": "On Saturday, Alfonso Ribeiro guest judged on \"Strictly Come Dancing,\" a UK celebrity ballroom dance competition, and everybody was hamming it up in his honor.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Wolfe", "Ralph Ellis"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190215083007-alfonso-ribeiro-carlton-dance-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
