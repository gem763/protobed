Now they can\u2019t avoid it.\n\nOn the national stage, the party\u2019s posture on impeachment is largely shaped by cable news fixtures like House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff or members of leadership like Pelosi.\n\n\n\nBut at dozens of town halls over the two-week recess, Brindisi and other vulnerable freshmen had to fend for themselves \u2014 serving as the party\u2019s on-the-ground voices on impeachment.\n\nWhether they can deliver a message that resonates could determine Democrats\u2019 chances of winning over the public and holding on to their seats and the House majority in 2020.\n\nEach town hall comes with high stakes and uncertain scenarios \u2014 pro-Trump protests or booming cheers for impeachment \u2014 and each time, lawmakers are forced to go beyond their leadership\u2019s talking points on the fast-moving scandal consuming the White House.\n\nPOLITICO has zeroed in on three House Democrats whose different approaches to impeachment underscore the tensions the party faces.\n\nThe hold-out\n\nOutside the New Hartford high school, a group of pro-Trump picketers stood on the manicured lawn shouting \u201cHonk for Trump!\u201d at every car that passed \u2014 at times, getting into shouting matches with drivers who didn\u2019t share their politics.\n\nBrindisi's district went for Trump by more than 15 points in 2016, but inside the packed auditorium, the audience skewed more liberal. There were deafening bursts of applause when Brindisi talked up climate change bills, tighter gun control and a \"more humane\" border policy.\n\nBut there were also cheers when he spoke about telling off his more progressive colleagues on \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d voting against Pelosi\u2019s speakership on the floor and his commitment to working with Trump \u2014 showcasing the kind of independent streak that Brindisi's supporters hope will keep him in Congress.\n\nBrindisi has frustrated some liberals inside and outside Washington for withholding his support for an impeachment inquiry into Trump, though he said he is disturbed by allegations that the president had pressured Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden, a potential 2020 opponent.\n\n\u201cWhen people talk to me about President Trump, I always said... if he\u2019s doing things that help the state, help the community, help the country, I\u2019ll be the first one to support him,\u201d Brindisi said.\n\nRep. Anthony Brindisi. | Heather Ainsworth/AP Photo\n\n\u201cBut if he\u2019s doing things that I think are going to harm this country \u2014 I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s Donald Trump or Barack Obama, if he\u2019s doing something that\u2019s going to hurt the country, I\u2019m going to stand up,\u201d Brindisi said, prompting a roar of applause.\n\nVoters of both parties said in interviews afterward that Brindisi is, so far, successfully straddling the issue of impeachment.\n\nBut if Brindisi were to vote against articles of impeachment on the floor, some Democratic voters said they would find someone else to support.\n\n\u201cHe would lose my vote,\u201d said Lauren Earl, the constituent who confronted Brindisi about impeachment during the town hall. She said she has even raised money for him, but would switch her loyalties if he ultimately voted against impeachment: \"I would find somebody to go against him.\u201d\n\nThe reluctant supporter\n\nRep. Susan Wild, a freshman Democrat who flipped a Republican seat held by former centrist GOP Rep. Charlie Dent, told a town hall meeting last week that impeachment \u201cwas the last thing in the world\u201d she wanted when she started in Congress.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018It will be a two year distraction,\u2019\u201d Wild told a standing room-only crowd at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pa. That was her thinking during the 2018 campaign and much of 2019.\n\nIt all changed, she said, after the Ukraine scandal erupted. Still, she eagerly touted the party\u2019s domestic agenda and spent relatively little time on impeachment, warning Democrats not to dwell on the investigation.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get through this inquiry,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope that it is expeditious. I don\u2019t want to be another Benghazi.\u201d One Trump defender in the audience shouted back, \u201cWe never got to the bottom of that.\u201d Nearby, people audibly sighed.\n\nTen months into her term, Wild is something of a political referee in her district. Her constituents are fiercely divided over their loyalties to the president, in a district that encompasses wealthy, well-educated suburbs as well as blue collar cities once known as oil refinery hubs.\n\nAt her town hall meeting on Oct. 2, Wild was forced to intervene as one of her constituents, a local doctor named John Jaffe, spoke up to decry \u201cendless accusations against the president\u201d and was drowned out by booing in the room and shouts for him to sit down.\n\n\u201cLet him speak,\u201d Wild pleaded above loud groans from the crowd as Jaffe decried the \u201czero facts\u201d in Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nWild \u2014 who is a top target for the GOP in 2020 \u2014 hasn\u2019t yet faced anti-impeachment ads in her district. But she acknowledged it could happen, after a GOP SuperPAC hit a neighboring Democrat, Rep. Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania, with attack ads for his stance in support of an inquiry.\n\nAsked by constituents if she believed she might lose her seat over impeachment, Wild said: \u201cAs far as political calculations go, I believe that I will be re-elected because of the work I've done for the people in this district, not because I went one way or the other on an impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nThe die-hard\n\nRep. Sean Casten is one of the rare vulnerable freshmen who has leaned hard into impeachment.\n\nBefore Casten won the suburban Chicago district in 2018, it was represented by a Republican for more than 45 years. Clinton narrowly won the district in 2016, but he expected to be grilled on his aggressive posture during a marathon stretch of six town hall meetings last Saturday.\n\nBut with a calm demeanor, Casten took on the pro-Trump voters one at a time.\n\nAt his first town hall event in South Barrington, Ill., Casten bluntly accused the president and his allies of deliberately lying about Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure foreign leaders to dig up dirt on Biden.\n\n\u201cThe fact that they are actively injecting entirely different conversations and conspiracy theories into the zeitgeist in order to force us to talk about that rather than objective truth is the underlying problem,\u201d Casten said.\n\nOne voter immediately stood up and accused Casten of trying to sow division, adding: \u201cWe put up with eight years of Barack Obama. And President Trump gets elected \u2014 people who don\u2019t like Trump should have to put up with him, too.\u201d\n\nCasten was unapologetic, ticking off the evidence contained in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election and hammering Trump over his solicitation of foreign assistance to investigate a political rival.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing equivalent about Obama and Trump,\u201d Casten said, prompting some jeers from the audience. \u201cTrump has had multiple members of his administration who have committed felonies or are in jail.\u201d\n\nAnother woman, sitting in the front row, raised her voice after Casten criticized Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president, saying that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint about the call \u201clooks like a bunch of 13-year-old girls gossiping about the person they don\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nMorning Score Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

I just think he\u2019s drooling on the checkers.\u201d\n\nAfter the series of town halls, Casten reflected on his personal voting history in an interview \u2014 revealing that he cast his ballot for George H.W. Bush and Bob Dole in the 1990s and lamenting that the Republican Party no longer resembles the GOP of the past.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think my values are any different than they were 20 years ago,\u201d Casten said. \u201cBut the Republican Party has run so far to the right and they\u2019ve been so captured by their base that there\u2019s just no home for Bob Doles and the George H.W. Bushes in the party anymore.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/4e/d2/c204c94c4bf58394beb0f5609dbc/191010-susan-wild-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
