The average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $1.15 per share. The latest results included a charge of 35 cents per share related to legal matters, offset somewhat by a gain of 20 cents per share from the sale of a business.\n\nThe biggest U.S. mortgage lender posted revenue of $26.88 billion in the period. Its revenue net of interest expense was $22.01 billion, up slightly from $21.94 billion a year earlier and surpassing Street forecasts. Five analysts surveyed by Zacks expected revenue of $21.12 billion.\n\nWells Fargo shares have climbed 7% since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index has increased 18%. The stock has decreased slightly more than 5% in the last 12 months.\n\n_____\n\nFILE - This Nov. 29, 2018, file photo shows a Wells Fargo bank location in Philadelphia.
