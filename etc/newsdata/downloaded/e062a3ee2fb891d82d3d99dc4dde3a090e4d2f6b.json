He said he's already getting a lot of questions from fans wondering if this year's squad can be even better than the 2018-19 team.\n\n\"Last year was a fantastic season. We were probably, it's fair to say, ahead of the curve. We were not expecting to be at that point at Christmas,\" said Tourigny.\n\nWhile the post-Christmas trades helped the 67's dominate the regular season, Tourigny said that meant giving up the flexibility of making similar deals this year.\n\n\"But we're really confident with the team we have,\" he added.", "description": "The Ottawa 67's set records for most wins in an Ontario Hockey League season and most consecutive playoff wins last year \u2014 and are eager to prove it was no fluke.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5292177.1569109070!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/67-s.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
