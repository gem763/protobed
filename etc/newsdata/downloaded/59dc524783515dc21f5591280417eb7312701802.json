Anti-gunners rallied around him, applauding him for being unapologetically in favor of harsh gun control measures that could eventually lead to firearm confiscation.\n\nO'Rourke is finally coming to the realization that he has absolutely no hope of obtaining the Democratic nomination for president. Since he knows his time is short lived, he's now asking his fellow Democratic contenders to support his gun control agenda.\n\nBeto penned an OpEd in Teen Vogue \u2013 a really strange outlet for this kind of plea \u2013 making the case for his anti-gun proposal (emphasis mine):\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t be able to bring a weapon of war to a peaceful protest. Assault weapons like AR-15s and AK-47s, designed to kill people as efficiently and effectively as possible, have no place in our communities \u2014 and if we don\u2019t want them to continue showing up in our classrooms, movie theaters, churches, and synagogues, we need to get them off our streets. That\u2019s a belief I\u2019ve come to after listening to Americans all across the country. People like Cathryn, the student I met in Derry, New Hampshire, who told me she knows exactly which bookshelf to pull down when a gunman comes to her school. People like Jessica Garcia, an AK-47 owner who was injured by the same kind of weapon in the El Paso shooting \u2014 and told me she would gladly sell it back. People like the assault weapon owner I met at a gun show in Conway, Arkansas, who defied my expectations and said he\u2019d cut his weapon into pieces if it would help end this epidemic. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve released the most ambitious plan to end gun violence in our country in this race \u2014 proposing not only universal background checks, Extreme Risk Protection Orders (aka, red flag laws), a federal licensing program, and a ban on the sale of assault weapons, but also a mandatory buyback of those weapons of war. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve called on credit card companies and banks to stop facilitating the sale of these weapons. It\u2019s why I am the only candidate in this race to sign onto the March For Our Lives Peace Plan, with the goal of cutting the number of firearm deaths and injuries in half over the next decade. And it\u2019s why I\u2019m calling on every other candidate in this race \u2014 and every member of our party in Congress \u2014 to meet the boldness of the American people and sign onto the March For Our Lives Peace Plan.\n\nBeto has continually pushed his anti-gun agenda. He has made it known that he's the only candidate calling universal background checks, red flag laws and a ban and mandatory buyback of \"assault weapons.\" If what he was doing was so bold and so many people agreed with him, wouldn't his polling numbers be through the roof? Wouldn't he be considered a top tier candidate?\n\nThe truth of the matter is this: most Americans are middle-of-the-road. They see Beto's plans for a mandatory \"buyback\" \u2013 which is a really stupid term considering the government never owned any of these firearms \u2013 and know firearm registration and realize this is a slippery slope. When the government knows exactly how many guns someone has and what type of firearms they possess, they're able to plan and confiscate them. And yes, anti-gunners will say we're wearing tinfoil hats but we're not. Beto has said he'd also consider a ban on all semi-automatic firearms, which is a large portion of the civilian market.\n\nHe seems to think that because he went to one gun show that he suddenly knows and understands each and every gun owner in America. Fact check, Beto: you don't. You actually know nothing about us and why we value the Second Amendment. You had one person tell you they'd be willing to \"sell back\" their so-called \"assault weapon.\" That doesn't mean that every other firearm owner feels the same way. In fact, the lady you talk to is definitely the exception, not the rule.\n\nWe do, however, have to give Beto credit for one thing: he is at least ballsy enough to say exactly what he wants to do. We now have confirmation that anti-gunners seek to disarm us. And Democrats can't say we're being extreme or fringe.\n\nCongrats, Beto. You will forever be known as the failed presidential candidate who single-handedly told law-abiding gun owners that you seek to disarm us. And that will never be forgotten.", "description": "Geez..10/01/2019 0:24:53AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Timothy Meads", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/263/306a19ff-b5e0-48fd-aefa-3be0177fc5f3.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
