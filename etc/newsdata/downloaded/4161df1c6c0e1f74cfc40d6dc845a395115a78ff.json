Musk clarified that FSD means that a car is \"able to be autonomous but requiring supervision and intervention at times.\"\n\nMusk did qualify that there is a possibility that this may not happen, but he indicated that the company \"appears to be on track\" to do so.\n\nThis release follows in the footsteps of the \"Smart Summon\" feature -- which has already been used over one million times since its release in September -- that allows Tesla vehicles to navigate their way around a parking lot to pick up their owner up to 200 ft away. An updated version of the software is expected to roll out in about a week.\n\nAccording to Musk during the call, the full-self driving feature likely won't be available to the public until the end of 2020 when it's \"reliable enough that you do not need to pay attention, in our opinion.\"", "description": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk's latest\u00a0claim about the company is that complete vehicle driving autonomy could roll out by the end of\u00a0the year.
