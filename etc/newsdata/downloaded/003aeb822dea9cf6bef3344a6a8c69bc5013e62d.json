The hearing will start at 10 a.m. EDT.\n\nIn August, the administration quietly decided to shut down the medically deferred action program, which exempted migrant families and their critically ill children from deportation while receiving crucial medical care in the United States. The program was ended without an announcement or time for public comment.\n\nHundreds of medical exemption applications were denied after the change and migrants and medical officials testified in the House last month, saying the administration chose to kill a life-saving program.\n\nA week later, the Department of Homeland Security sent a letter to the committee saying it was resuming \u201cconsideration of non-military deferred action requests on a discretionary, case-by-case basis.\u201d House lawmakers said, however, the administration has since refused to produce requested documents or make agency officials available to answer questions about the policy and its reversal.\n\nThursday, lawmakers will seek to learn how the administration will process medical requests going forward and whether Citizenship and Immigration Services will apply new standards or restrictions on migrant families seeking critical U.S. care.\n\nConsumer financial protection\n\nKraninger will testify before the Senate banking committee to detail the bureau\u2019s fall status report, which provides an overview of initiatives Kraninger has put in place since taking over the CFPB last December.\n\nThe report, which was released ahead of Thursday\u2019s hearing, also covers a review of consumers\u2019 access to financial services and products, plans for rule-making analysis of consumer complaints and an overview of supervisory and enforcement actions. It covers the bureau\u2019s actions between October 2018 and the end of March.\n\n\u201cThe bureau is considering further prioritization and planning of the bureau\u2019s rule-making activities, both with regard to substantive projects and modifications to the process that the bureau uses to develop and review regulations,\u201d the report states.\n\nKraninger presented the report in the House on Wednesday, where lawmakers questioned her about the CFPB\u2019s failure to protect American consumers from threats by debt collectors and its handling of student loans.\n\nKraninger says in the report, titled \u201cSemi-Annual Report Spring 2019,\u201d that the bureau is seeking the most effective means to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act, an Obama-era law that put substantial safeguards in place after the 2009 financial crisis, and other consumer protection statutes.\n\n\u201cI am committed to strengthening the consumer financial marketplace by providing financial institutions clear \u2018rules of the road\u2019 that allow them to offer consumers a range of high-quality, innovative financial services and products,\u201d she wrote.", "description": "Oct. 17 (UPI) \u2014 Congress will hold two key hearings Thursday on Trump administration policy \u2014 involving the deportations of ill migrant", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
