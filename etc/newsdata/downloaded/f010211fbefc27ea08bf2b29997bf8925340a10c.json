Turkey began an invasion into northeastern Syria earlier this month \u2014 a move that even Trump\u2019s State Department says is worrisome, according to documents Vox\u2019s Alex Ward obtained over the weekend:\n\n\u201cTurkey\u2019s military offensive is severely undermining counter-ISIS efforts, endangering innocent civilians, and threatening peace, security, and stability in the region,\u201d read some of the talking points written by the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs and obtained by Vox.\n\nThough other details about the delegation\u2019s discussions are limited, the trips likely included US lawmakers attempting to soothe concerns about what Trump\u2019s chaotic foreign policy means for the region.\n\nBut beyond talking to American allies and trying to provide some sense of reassurance, and a few retroactive legislative steps, there\u2019s not much Congress can do. Trump has wide latitude to make decisions about where American troops are placed \u2014 even if the vast majority of lawmakers disagree with them.\n\nNo matter what, those decisions will have lasting repercussions.\n\nPelosi and a House delegation visited Jordan and Afghanistan over the weekend\n\nPelosi was joined by eight other lawmakers on her overseas trip, including House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Eliot Engel, House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff, and House Homeland Security Chair Bennie Thompson. The trip included one Republican, Rep. Mac Thornberry, the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nIn a statement, Pelosi said talks focused on keeping the region stable after US troops were withdrawn and Turkish troops moved in, fighting Kurds in northeastern Syria who had been key US allies up until now. On Thursday, the Trump administration hastily brokered a five-day ceasefire between Turkey and the Kurds, but there were reports of continued shelling Thursday night and Friday.\n\nAnd they also discussed the vacuum created by the US leaving, both giving an opening to Russia and Iran to gain more of a foothold in the region, and possibly giving rise to the reemergence of ISIS.\n\n\u201cOur bipartisan delegation is visiting Jordan at a critical time for the security and stability of the region,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement released Saturday. \u201cWith the deepening crisis in Syria after Turkey\u2019s incursion, our delegation has engaged in vital discussions about the impact to regional stability, increased flow of refugees, and the dangerous opening that has been provided to ISIS, Iran and Russia.\u201d\n\nYesterday, our bipartisan delegation met with @KingAbdullahII & Crown Prince Al Hussein bin Abdullah II to discuss the US-Jordan strategic partnership, regional stability, counterterrorism, security cooperation, Middle East peace, economic development & other shared challenges. pic.twitter.com/WCLxAu0ywn \u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) October 20, 2019\n\nIn Afghanistan, Pelosi and the delegation briefly met with Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, as well as Gen. Austin Miller, the commanding officer of US forces in Afghanistan.\n\nPelosi said the US and Afghan delegations discussed \u201csenior Afghanistan government officials to discuss security issues, improving governance and economic development,\u201d as well as cracking down on corruption issues and boosting the role of women in the country.\n\nUS leaders from both parties are scrambling to reassure American allies in the Middle East\n\nRepublican and Democratic politicians alike have spent the past week scrambling to contain the fallout from Trump\u2019s actions in Syria.\n\nAs the US president has repeated talking points from Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, lawmakers from both parties leveled searing criticism at Trump, arguing his abandonment of the Kurds will result in bloodshed, and set a terrible example for other US foreign allies.\n\n\u201cWithdrawing U.S. forces from Syria is a grave strategic mistake,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wrote in a recent Washington Post op-ed. \u201cIt will leave the American people and homeland less safe, embolden our enemies, and weaken important alliances. Sadly, the recently announced pullout risks repeating the Obama administration\u2019s reckless withdrawal from Iraq, which facilitated the rise of the Islamic State in the first place.\u201d\n\nMcConnell and other Republican lawmakers, who have largely stuck by Trump on most other issues, talked about their fear the situation in Syria could embolden Russia and other American adversaries in the region, and entirely remake the geopolitical power structure to Russia\u2019s advantage and America\u2019s detriment.\n\n\u201cWe are ignoring Russia\u2019s efforts to leverage its increasingly dominant position in Syria to amass power and influence throughout the Middle East and beyond,\u201d McConnell wrote. \u201cWhile Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s offensive into northeastern Syria is misguided, is it really the case that the United States would prefer that Russian, Syrian and Iranian forces control the region rather than Turkey, our NATO ally?\u201d\n\nVice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled to Turkey last week to strike a deal with Erdo\u011fan on a ceasefire, but there are conflicting reports on whether that ceasefire is really working.\n\nLast week, Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer declared the ceasefire and Trump\u2019s decision to reverse bipartisan sanctions a \u201csham.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s decision to reverse sanctions against Turkey for brutally attacking our Kurdish partners in exchange for a sham ceasefire seriously undermines the credibility of America\u2019s foreign policy and sends a dangerous message to our allies and adversaries alike that our word cannot be trusted,\u201d Pelosi and Schumer said in a statement.\n\nPelosi and McConnell are suddenly finding themselves united in opposing Trump\u2019s foreign policy blunder in Syria \u2014 even if most of what they can do is condemn Trump\u2019s actions, attempt to pass sanctions, reassure allies, and counsel the White House.", "description": "After Trump abandoned a key ally in the Middle East, Nancy Pelosi and a bipartisan group of lawmakers visited other allies in Jordan and Afghanistan.", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen", "Shirin Ghaffary", "Ian Millhiser", "Zack Beauchamp", "Alex Abad-Santos", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1mlRuluKuKMp8E2vpZpy94yVtUw=/0x162:4835x2693/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19306809/1176192940.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
