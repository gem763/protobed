Unthinking, knee-jerk Corbynphobia is a danger in the precarious weeks ahead, as the country\u2019s fate hangs by that red thread. As parliament is brutishly banished by Boris Johnson after failing to secure an election, both sides retire to plot feverish ploys and counterploys for the Brexit endgame.\n\nNo-deal Brexit: cross-party rebel alliance gears up for clash with Johnson Read more\n\nJohnson\u2019s crew brief that they have scores of cunning loopholes to escape the paralysing parliamentary vice that stops him crashing the country out of the EU with no deal on 31 October, even defying the law. But the rebel alliance of opposition parties and Tory refugees is confident there is no trapdoor he can slip through without parliamentary consent.\n\nThat alliance has been remarkably solid \u2013 Labour, the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Greens and Plaid Cymru, more used to battling over every seat \u2013 combining with the exiled Tories. Good grief, even with Philip Hammond, the demon austerity chancellor only weeks ago! Their unity of purpose and voting discipline was forged throughout the summer when they met, phoned and WhatsApped. Opposing a general election was a difficult hurdle for Corbyn: he, like all opposition leaders, called for one every day. (It\u2019s said the absence of his strategy chief, Seumas Milne, on a prolonged holiday greatly eased the process of persuading the Labour leader: Milne and his coterie \u201cbristle\u201d at cooperation with other parties.) But the need to prevent Johnson calling an election across the Halloween tripwire date was paramount. The good sense of Keir Starmer, working with John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry, has nudged Corbyn a long way.\n\nParties must swallow their squeamishness and vote the Labour leader in if that\u2019s ever required\n\nBut ahead lie many equally challenging tests of alliance unity. When parliament reconvenes in October it will have 12 days to close all loopholes and prevent a no-deal exit. Johnson may resign, or as a last resort Labour may need to depose him with a no-confidence vote. If so, the leader of the opposition would be called first to form an interim government; but will the alliance stomach him? When first mooted, the answer was no, but many are showing a new willingness to accept the inevitable.\n\nTake Kenneth Clarke, the expelled former Tory chancellor. Asked which is worse, Corbyn or no-deal Brexit, he tells the Observer: \u201cBoth are awful prospects, but I think a no-deal Brexit could cause far more damage to our future economic success than Corbyn.\u201d More astonishing is last week\u2019s report \u201cCity warms to Corbyn\u201d in the Telegraph (yes, the Telegraph!). Citibank and Deutsche Bank analysts say he is \u201cnow seen as the lesser of two evils\u201d. His policies may be \u201cmarket-unfriendly\u201d but still preferable to the \u201cpermanent shock\u201d of no-deal Brexit. \u201cFears\u201d of Labour \u201cmay be overstated\u201d.\n\nOthers need persuading: the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, may be softening her \u201cno way\u201d stance. If not, she\u2019ll lose the party\u2019s reputation for pragmatic politics. Starmer says to exit the EU with no deal through squabbling would be unforgivable. It can\u2019t and mustn\u2019t happen. Understandably, Swinson fears that going into an election in November she may be attacked as a Corbyn stooge, but she\u2019d never be forgiven if she let Britain crash out.\n\nParties must swallow their squeamishness and vote the Labour leader in if that\u2019s ever required. To prefer some grandee risks breaking the unity and goodwill of the alliance. In any case, to be an interim prime minister in this broken-backed parliament is almost meaningless: Corbyn would only have permission to call an election or do whatever parliament required. He would be as powerless as Johnson to promote his party\u2019s policies without majority backing: a no-confidence vote could remove him instantly.\n\nThe notion of Corbyn the bogeyman has taken on a life of its own, giving him the worst personal ratings ever of any opposition leader. Day in, day out, scare stories in the Sun and Mail stoke the terror. This week\u2019s Sunday Times leader warns Tory rebels against allying with him: \u201cGiven the chance, his circle of Stalinists will eat them for lunch. The far left, once in power, does not surrender it easily.\u201d The Mail on Sunday\u2019s leader calls him \u201ca doddering, ill-educated Marxist\u201d. After a week that exposed the prime minister\u2019s serial incapacities, they take fright: proroguing today saves Johnson from another PMQs humiliation at the hands of Corbyn.\n\nBrexit party: Farage seeks election pact with Conservatives Read more\n\nIt\u2019s no use wishing for another leader of the opposition: this is the one Labour has, and in this crisis he is now stepping up to the plate. His leadership of the alliance has been \u201ccollegiate\u201d: he is the grownup, while Johnson breaks things. Theresa May lost her 20-point lead in the 2017 election; Johnson\u2019s lead in the polls is about half that. Corbyn\u2019s manifesto back then was highly popular and you can bet it will sell well again. He\u2019s a good campaigner; Johnson may disappoint.\n\nPolls reveal little. Even Rallings and Thrasher, granular analysts of every ward, say the coming election is \u201cthe most difficult to predict in a generation\u201d. Pollsters expect another hung parliament. In all this volatility, Johnson is proving a dud so far and Labour could well be the biggest party, though an overall majority is near impossible \u2013 a settlement with alliance partners will be essential. So this progressive alliance must stick together, with informal pacts on seats to see off Johnson and Nigel Farage, who are likely to ally. To win, Labour needs a great push for tactical voting, as analysed by YouGov founder Peter Kellner. Stand alone and the Brexiters win.\n\nJohnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, boasts that he\u2019s winning the long game: that voters despising the SW1 palaver will punish the parties that stopped Brexit. He may be right, Johnson could win on a mere third of the vote. But here\u2019s the even longer view: he would be in charge of his own calamitous no-deal crashout, and have no one else to blame. Winning would feel very like losing \u2013 no cake and no eating it.\n\n\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist", "description": "It\u2019s no use wishing for another opposition leader: we need a united alliance, and he is stepping up, says Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee", "authors": ["Polly Toynbee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ca503198e3a1df20ace36a42035d458291abe7a/0_179_5376_3226/master/5376.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=fa9531fac2c5c814cba48ea943a468c7", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
