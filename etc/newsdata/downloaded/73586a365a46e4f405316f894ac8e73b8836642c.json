(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nJay Gruden does not want to be fired. He does not want any of his assistant coaches to be fired. The Washington Redskins\u2019 head coach believes this season is salvageable, that winning is just around the corner, so he will not bench his starting quarterback in favor of the team\u2019s top draft pick, no matter how much fans cry for Dwayne Haskins to replace Case Keenum.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve played three games. There\u2019s 13 games left in the season. The season\u2019s not lost. It\u2019s not over,\u201d Gruden said during a particularly raw moment on a Tuesday conference call after Monday night\u2019s 31-15 loss to Chicago dropped Washington to 0-3. \u201cI know everybody wants to say, \u2018It\u2019s over,\u2019 and, \u2018The season\u2019s over; go ahead and play Haskins.\u2019 But we feel confident we can turn this thing around.\u201d\n\n[Svrluga: At 0-3, it\u2019s time to ask: What is this Redskins season even about?]\n\nGruden added that he continues to think Keenum gives the team a better chance to win than Haskins, but many fans and league observers would love to see Haskins start Sunday at the New York Giants, who already have benched longtime starter Eli Manning in favor of their top draft pick, Daniel Jones. Haskins was taken nine picks after Jones, so the two are often linked.\n\nBut the Giants already declared this a rebuilding year by letting go of several high-priced players and former top draft picks, including Redskins safety Landon Collins. Jones always seemed destined to play early this year. Gruden is fighting for his job in a season that owner Daniel Snyder and team president Bruce Allen did not want to throw away.\n\nWhile Gruden said Monday night that he does not believe his job is in immediate danger and he won\u2019t make any drastic moves such as firing assistants, he has also maintained that Haskins isn\u2019t ready to start. He defended the more experienced Keenum, who has played well at times, pointing out that Keenum is second in the NFL with 86 completions and fourth with 933 passing yards.\n\nBut Keenum had five turnovers Monday, with three interceptions and two lost fumbles. And while the 0-3 start is hardly all Keenum\u2019s fault given the Redskins have allowed at least 31 points in every game, he hasn\u2019t been able to lead the team back in the second half, either.\n\nEven if Gruden were to bench Keenum, there is no guarantee he would start Haskins. Colt McCoy, Gruden\u2019s longtime backup with the Redskins, is expected to return to practice this week after dealing with complications from a series of offseason surgeries on his right leg. The coaches had all but named McCoy the starter in training camp before his leg started to hurt. McCoy won\u2019t have enough practice time to play Sunday, but Gruden left open the possibility that McCoy might start in the future.\n\n\u201cIf we feel like Dwayne gives us the best chance to win in a coming game, we\u2019ll definitely put Dwayne out there,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cIf we feel like it\u2019s Colt, when he gets healthy, it could be Colt. But right now we feel like it\u2019s Case Keenum, and we\u2019re going to move forward with him this week.\u201d\n\nSo for now, Haskins waits. He was clearly behind McCoy and Keenum in training camp, but that was to be expected because they were longtime NFL quarterbacks and Haskins started only one season at Ohio State. In the summer, Haskins had regular chances to play with the starting unit during practice. Those opportunities have dwindled, Gruden said, because the team has to give Keenum most of the snaps.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s learning in the classroom,\u201d Gruden said of Haskins. \u201cThis is new for him, as it is for every rookie quarterback in the NFL that\u2019s playing right now. Some of them are doing fine. Some of them are struggling a little bit. Right now, I think Dwayne\u2019s on pace. He just needs to continue to sit back and learn and continue to develop.\u201d\n\nAnd Gruden doesn\u2019t want to take time to develop Haskins if the team\u2019s postseason hopes are not dead. He talked Tuesday about the hope he still sees for this season. After watching video of the Bears loss, he saw opportunities that were lost and said he believes they won\u2019t be missed in the future. He likes the way the team kept fighting after falling behind 28-0 and said, \u201cWe have a strong locker room down there and are doing some good things.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fight left in those guys,\u201d he added.\n\nHe expressed surprise that the defense has allowed opponents to convert a stunning 63 percent of their third downs, which ranks worst in the league. He said he expected this team to be more like the one last year before quarterback Alex Smith broke his right leg \u2014 one with a defense that kept opponents from scoring touchdowns and an offense that would protect the ball and position the team to win a field-position game.\n\nThat has not happened.\n\n\u201cI still have a strong feeling the defense will get better and play better moving forward,\u201d Gruden said.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a big reason he isn\u2019t ready to play Haskins \u2014 at least not yet.\n\nRead more on the Washington Redskins:\n\nThree takeaways from Redskins\u2019 31-15 loss to the Bears\n\nRedskins remain uncertain as to when tight end Jordan Reed will return\n\nBooger McFarland on Redskins defense, \u2018iconic\u2019 FedEx Field and Bruce Allen", "description": "Washington's coach said he isn't ready to start the first-round draft pick, despite the team's 0-3 start.", "authors": ["Les Carpenter", "Reporter Covering Washington Redskins", "September At Pm", "Les Carpenter Returned To The Washington Post In", "Writes About The Washington Redskins."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ISlFg5RbDS7pBap_G_npKb-0kKI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UB4D2WW6QAI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
