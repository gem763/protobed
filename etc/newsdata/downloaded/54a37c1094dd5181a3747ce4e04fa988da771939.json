That's why so many people can't relate to it.\"\n\nShe said that the U.S. is suffering from a \"sociopathic economic system\" that doesn't value the American worker. She also criticized conservative evangelical Christians for their focus on social issues.\n\n\"Jesus was about loving each other. Jesus was about loving the poor and feeding the poor. Jesus was about radical compassion for our fellow human beings,\" Williamson said. However, she condemned mainstream Democrats for being too dismissive of the power of spirituality and religion.\n\n\"Memo to Earth: We're a religious country. And I don't think it has served the Democratic Party at all that it has come to be associated almost with an arrogant and condescending attitude toward people of faith,\" Williamson said.\n\nWilliamson also spoke about some of her policy proposals, including her proposal to institute reparations for African-American descendants of slaves. Her plan calls for $200 - $500 billion for reparations.\n\n\"The thing about reparations that I feel is very important, and this goes beyond race based policies, there is an inherent mea culpa, there is an inherent acknowledgement of a wrong that has been done by one people to another and of a debt owed. So reparations carries an emotional and psychological and even and spiritual force,\" Williamson said.\n\nFor more of Major's conversation with Marianne Williamson, download \"The Takeout\" podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Play, Stitcher, or Spotify.
