Fans from all over the world are attending, and a percentage of them have been rowdy. On TV Tackle, one of Beat Takeshi\u2019s television programs, the issue of poorly behaved foreigner tourists was once again a topic of discussion.\n\nThere has been footage of rugby fans causing chaos, smoking in non-smoking areas, and generally being noisy.\n\nJapanese people like to think of themselves as above doing things like this. For the most part, that\u2019s true. Trains are quiet. There is no singing, let alone human pyramids.\n\nScrolling through comments on blogs and Twitter, people in Japan attribute the bad behaviour to a difference in how people are raised. But don\u2019t believe go wild when Japanese sports teams win championships, too? One of Japan\u2019s most famous sports curses came about after Osaka baseball fans stole a Colonel Sanders statue from KFC and chucked it in the Dotombori River. And it\u2019s not just sports: Halloween in Shibuya last year resulted in Japanese people overturning a small truck and leaving trash all over.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t give visitors the ok to do the same, of course. Good manners aside, considering how the Japanese authorities can hold people in custody for up to 23 days without charging them for a crime, I\u2019d advise visitors to do everything they can not to piss off the police. Rugby fans should celebrate; they should not cause problems and destroy property, whether that\u2019s in Japan or anywhere else.\n\nJapanese TV is once again focusing on the bad behaviour of foreigners. Back in 2002, it did the same for the Japan-co-hosted World Cup, warning locals of an impending invasion of soccer hooligans, hell-bent on fighting and wrecking stuff.\n\nOn TV Tackle, the panel discussed whether or not stores and restaurants should have signs that read \u5916\u56fd\u4eba\u89b3\u5149\u5ba2\u304a\u65ad\u308a or \u201cNo foreign tourists allowed\u201d to help avoid any trouble. I guess that means if you are a foreign resident in Japan, you\u2019ll always need to show your resident visa status to get in?\n\nThis show covered similar ground to one last year (the YouTube video has since gone). In particular, more fascination with drunk foreigners in Golden Gai. https://t.co/VZfvIWw7EM \u2014 Mulboyne (@Mulboyne) October 16, 2019\n\nThe Japanese government started an omotenashi campaign to welcome foreign visitors. \u201cOmotenashi\u201d refers to selfless Japanese hospitality that aims to give the guest an excellent and memorable experience.\n\nForeigners behaving badly: Golden Gai edition pic.twitter.com/RWpf2qYmOv \u2014 Mulboyne (@Mulboyne) October 16, 2019\n\nThese clips show misbehaving foreigners. At the start of the second clip, a bar owner is upset that the foreigners are banging on the table. He\u2019s unable to communicate and seems to give up.\n\nFor reference, here are some of the Golden Gai signs featured on the show. pic.twitter.com/PJVmGIODux \u2014 Mulboyne (@Mulboyne) October 16, 2019\n\nOne panelist discussed whether the Japanese government had actually thought through what would happen if large numbers of tourists started visiting, while another wondered if Japan actually has a culture of omotenashi. After all, this is a country that banned foreigners from entering, save for only specific ports, for well over 200 years.\n\nThere are certainly problems caused by tourism. Just look how geisha and maiko are swarmed in Kyoto as they go to work.\n\nBut there have also been good things about tourism.\n\nForeign fans cheering for the Japanese rugby team.\n\n???????????? #Japan #RWC2019\n\nMorning Japan!\n\nCanada players volunteer to clean up mud on a road in Kamaishi, northeastern Japan, on Oct. 13, following the cancellation of their Rugby World Cup Pool B match against Namibia due to the powerful typhoon #Hagibis.\n\nVCG Pics pic.twitter.com/owo1CWxMl5 \u2014 CCTV Asia Pacific (@CCTVAsiaPacific) October 14, 2019\n\nPeople helping strangers.\n\nA bad day at the Rugby World Cup, but we\u2019ve had such a good experience in Japan. A very excited and emotional Japan fan insisted on giving me this Ireland-themed origami crane outside the stadium after the game.
