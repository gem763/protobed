As in the government\u2019s antitrust action against Microsoft Corp. two decades ago, state attorneys general are likely to provide important contributions to the substance of the investigations, complementing the federal efforts.\n\n\u201cThe states can play a crucial role in augmenting federal antitrust enforcement,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, a senior adviser at Public Knowledge, a consumer group that focuses on tech issues. \u201cCases are so resource intensive that dividing the work could be enormously valuable to cover the entire digital landscape.\u201d\n\nDetails of the Google probe are to be disclosed at a news conference outside the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday. A bipartisan group of perhaps more than 40 attorneys general will join that effort, which is being led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nIn a news release Friday, Mr. Paxton\u2019s office said the news conference will detail \u201ca multistate investigation into whether large tech companies have engaged in anticompetitive behavior that stifled competition, restricted access and harmed consumers.\u201d\n\nFormal civil subpoenas are likely to begin going out from that effort soon, according to the people familiar with the matter. The investigation will examine Google\u2019s impact on digital advertising and information markets, according to one of the people, as well as whether the firm has stifled innovation or harmed consumer choice and privacy.\n\nSeparately, New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, confirmed a Wall Street Journal report Friday that her office is organizing a bipartisan, multistate antitrust probe into whether social-media company Facebook \u201chas stifled competition and put users at risk,\u201d as she said in a statement. \u201cWe will use every investigative tool at our disposal to determine whether Facebook\u2019s actions may have endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers\u2019 choices, or increased the price of advertising.\u201d\n\nJoining in the Facebook investigation so far are attorneys general of Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and the District of Columbia, Ms. James said. The wide-ranging investigation focuses on Facebook\u2019s \u201cdominance in the industry and the potential anticompetitive conduct stemming from that dominance,\u201d her office said.\n\nFacebook recently agreed to shell out $5 billion to settle Federal Trade Commission allegations that it repeatedly used deceptive disclosures and account settings to lure users into sharing personal information, and it remains under federal scrutiny for issues including whether it acquired companies such as Instagram to stave off competition. State attorneys general also are expected to examine those issues, along with Facebook\u2019s use of data and its role in the huge digital advertising market.\n\nThis year, Google\u2019s share of the total U.S. digital ad market will be 37%, and Facebook\u2019s will be 22%, according to eMarketer, a research firm.\n\nBig Tech Probes Here\u2019s a look at the investigations into big technology companies Justice Department : Investigators are conducting a broad review of online platforms and impacts on competition, innovation and consumers.

NY AG Group: A group of state attorney generals led by New York is looking at whether Facebook has stifled competition, endangered consumer data and reduced quality of consumer choices.\n\nFacebook declined to comment.\n\nGoogle, which also is facing a Justice Department antitrust probe, said it is cooperating with the inquiries.\n\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s services help people every day, create more choice for consumers, and support thousands of jobs and small businesses across the country,\u201d said Google spokesman Jose Casta\u00f1eda. \u201cWe continue to work constructively with regulators, including attorneys general, in answering questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector.\u201d\n\nTech firms generally have contended that they operate in highly competitive markets.\n\nThe action by the attorneys general, which has been anticipated for weeks, could be expanded to other companies beyond Google and Facebook soon, some of the people said.\n\nPublic-opinion polls suggest Americans are increasingly growing disenchanted with tech companies, in particular social-media platforms, even as they remain hooked on their services.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton will lead the investigation into Google.

So we need to do something about that.\u201d\n\nGoogle also is drawing particular attention for its outsize role in the digital advertising market.\n\n\u201cPractically everything the [Securities and Exchange Commission] wouldn\u2019t allow on a commodities exchange happens every day in Google\u2019s digital advertising space,\u201d Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry said at the June hearing, held by the FTC. Because of Google\u2019s extensive control of the digital-advertising market, Mr. Landry added, \u201cGoogle gets to pick the winners and losers, because the system is rigged in their favor and ripe with conflicts.\u201d\n\nFor now, it appears unlikely the state and federal investigations will be formally coordinated. But the federal enforcers have been meeting with state attorneys general, and closer cooperation could develop as the probes move forward.\n\n\u201cThe FTC values our cooperative relationship with the AGs and routinely coordinates on tech and antitrust issues,\u201d a spokeswoman for the FTC said.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James is organizing the probe into Facebook.

About 20 attorneys general were involved in the federal government\u2019s antitrust case against Microsoft two decades ago.\n\nMicrosoft eventually agreed to an array of conditions in that case, including making the Windows platform more accessible to third-party software developers.\n\nAt a minimum, the state officials\u2019 involvement this time is sure to add complexity and cost for the companies. For instance, the state attorneys are often able to extract large fines in antitrust cases, in circumstances where federal enforcers can\u2019t.\n\nAt the same time, the state attorneys will face the challenge of coordinating complex investigations among so many offices. Some attorney general offices, particularly in smaller states, also lack the personnel and resources to throw into the demanding job.\n\nWhile the state attorneys\u2019 involvement is important, \u201cthis is a heavy lift,\u201d said Harry First, a New York University law professor who co-wrote a book on the Microsoft case. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have the states in there, they can perform the role they performed in the Microsoft case, which was to really dig into the investigation.\u201d\n\nWrite to John D.
