He was sent to hospital but confirmed dead,\u201d Hiroki Yashiro, a spokesman at Ichihara Fire Department, in Chiba, told AFP.\n\nHours of torrential rain prompted the JMA to issue their top-level emergency warning for heavy rain for parts of Tokyo and surrounding areas, issued only when disasters are expected.\n\nHagibis is forecast to be the first storm rated \u201cvery strong\u201d to hit the main island of Honshu since 1991, when the category system was introduced, a JMA official said.\n\nBy mid-afternoon, 3.25 million people were under non-mandatory evacuation orders, and more than 13,500 people had moved to shelters, including some whose homes were damaged by a powerful typhoon that hit the region last month.\n\n\u201cI evacuated because my roof was ripped off by the other typhoon and rain came in. I\u2019m so worried about my house,\u201d a 93-year-old man told national broadcaster NHK as he sheltered at a centre in Tateyama in Chiba east of Tokyo.\n\nHagibis is an unusually large storm, expected to bring \u201cbrutal winds and violent seas\u201d to large swathes of the country, the weather agency said.\n\n\u2013 Power outages \u2013\n\nWith the centre of the storm still hundreds of kilometres away in the Pacific, torrential rain was falling and tornado-like gusts of wind ripped into several homes in Chiba, destroying one.\n\nFive people including a three-year-old boy were sent to hospital, but none suffered serious injuries, the local fire department told AFP.\n\nIn Gotemba, west of Tokyo, the fire department said it had rescued one man who fell into a swollen canal but was still searching for a second.\n\nThe JMA has forecast half a metre of rain for the Tokyo area in the 24 hours to midday on Sunday, with more for the central Tokai region, but many rivers were close to breaching their banks by Saturday afternoon.\n\nLocal authorities warned they would release water from the Shiroyama dam, southwest of Tokyo, possibly starting at 5pm, warning people living near downstream to be on alert.\n\nThousands of homes in Tokyo and the surrounding areas lost power, though in some cases only briefly, with crews working to reconnect people as quickly as possible.\n\nAutomakers, including Toyota and Honda, have shut down their factories, and many supermarkets and convenience stores in the capital closed, a day after residents shopping for typhoon supplies emptied the shelves.\n\n\u2013 Rugby, F1 disrupted \u2013\n\nThe storm has forced the delay of Japanese Grand Prix qualifiers scheduled for Saturday and the cancellation of two Rugby World Cup matches: England-France and New Zealand-Italy.\n\nIt could also jeopardise a key match-up between Scotland and Japan on Sunday. Officials are not expected to make a final decision on that game until Sunday morning, after they have assessed any damage to the venue and transport links.\n\nScotland face elimination if the match is axed and have warned they could take legal action if the game is cancelled. World Rugby called the threat \u201cdisappointing\u201d.\n\nThe storm is also causing transport chaos over a long weekend in Japan.\n\nBy early afternoon, all departing flights from Tokyo\u2019s Haneda and Narita airports were grounded, with bullet trains and local trains halting some or all services.\n\nEven Tokyo\u2019s Disneyland and DisneySea theme parks shut up shop in their first ever all-day typhoon closure.\n\nJapan is hit by around 20 typhoons a year, though the capital is not usually badly affected.\n\nHagibis is bearing down on the region just weeks after Typhoon Faxai hit the area with similar strength, killing two and causing major damage in Chiba", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Powerful Typhoon Hagibis on Saturday claimed its first victim even before making landfall, as Japanese weather authorities issued a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/bab5ef_typhoon-hagibis-has-forced-cancellation-flights-bullet-trains-local-lines-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
