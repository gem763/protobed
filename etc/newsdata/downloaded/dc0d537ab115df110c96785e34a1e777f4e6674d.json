Horowitz, also said the letter creates \u201cuncertainty\u201d for federal employees about whether to file whistleblower complaints.\n\nThe OLC last month authored a memo saying it disagreed with Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson\u2019s determination that the whistleblower complaint was an \u201curgent concern,\u201d which would require that it be turned over to Congress.\n\nUnder federal statute, an \u201curgent concern\u201d involves \u201cthe funding, administration, or operation of an intelligence activity under the authority of the DNI,\u201d the OLC concluded.\n\nIn a September letter to the Justice Department, Mr. Atkinson defended labeling the report an \u201curgent concern.\u201d He said the OLC\u2019s conclusions were \u201cgravely troubling\u201d and \u201ccontrary\u201d to established precedent.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
