The aircraft had a long postwar career, including a stint as a target in nuclear tests, before a lengthy rebuilding process restored her to flying condition. The bomber did have a close call in 1987, when a landing mishap severely damaged the aircraft.\n\nPhoto credit: PhotoQuest - Getty Images More\n\nThe original Nine-O-Nine was a Boeing B-17G \u201cFlying Fortress\u201d bomber. Nearly 13,000 B-17s were built over the course of World War II, serving in both the Pacific and European theaters. Each four-engine bomber had a crew of ten, a top speed of 287 miles an hour, and could carry a payload of 4,500 bombs on a long distance bombing mission.\n\nThe B-17G was assigned to the 323rd Bomb Squadron, 91st Bomb Group. Nine-O-Nine was part of the legendary Eighth Air Force, or \u201cMighty Eighth,\u201d a bomber force that struck strategic targets across Germany and occupied Europe. The aircraft\u2019s name came from its serial number, the last three digits of which were 909.

By April 1945 she had flown 140 missions without a mission abort, which according to Airplanes of the Past \u201cis believed to be the Eighth Air Force record for most missions.\u201d Nine-O-Nine also never lost a crewman as a casualty. The bomber made eighteen trips to Berlin, flew 1,129 hours, and dropped 2,810 tons of bombs.\n\nBut the the bomber was dismantled after the war, and the second Nine-O-Nine was built at Long Beach, California, by the Douglas Aircraft Company and accepted for U.S. Army Air Force service in April 1945. The plane, serial number #44-83575 , never saw combat but was converted to a SB-17G search and rescue aircraft in 1951 and served in Puerto Rico. The aircraft later served as part of the Military Air Transport Service, the precursor to the Air Force\u2019s Air Mobility Command.\n\nIn 1952, retired from U.S. military service, the aircraft was renamed \u201cMiss Yucca\u201d and parked on a nuclear test range in Nevada. There she was subjected to three different nuclear explosions to test the effects of nuclear weapons on aircraft. After a 13-year \u201ccooling down period\u201d to allow radiation to subside, the bomber was sold as scrap to the Aircraft Specialties Company, which began a lengthy restoration. The bomber then served twenty years as a forest fire water bomber, dropping water and borate on forest fires.", "description": "The bomber involved in Tuesday\u2019s fatal crash in Connecticut never made it to war, but served as a search and rescue plane and water bomber.", "authors": ["Kyle Mizokami"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SL5SQJK7.u3Xst6IIewgiw--~B/aD02MDI7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/popular_mechanics_642/05cc9ea9c5fcc8770ce22d272d90d658", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
