This is all so traumatic for me.\"\n\nA spokesman for Adra said: \"Our priority is always to support and sustain tenancies and we work with partner agencies to try and prevent homelessness.\n\n\"We only take legal action as a last resort. In this case, the court decided that the granting of possession was reasonable and proportionate.\"", "description": "Susan Ralphs is being evicted by housing association Adra from her property in north Wales - but she insists she is \"very hygienic\"", "authors": ["Mari Jones", "Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Daily Post Wales"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20558343.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Susan-Ralphs-from-Pen-y-Gwndwen-Blaenau-Ffestiniog-in-her-home-and-garden-where-she-has-hoarded-ite.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
