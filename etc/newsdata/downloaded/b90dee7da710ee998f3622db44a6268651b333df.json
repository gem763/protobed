If not the UK will leave with no deal,\u201d the source added.\n\nEuropean leaders have reacted tepidly to London\u2019s latest propositions.\n\nBritain has urged the EU to intensify talks over the proposals, as European leaders warned it must revise its plans within days in order to conclude a deal this month.\n\nBrexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said the bloc needed to show \u201ccreativity and flexibility\u201d ahead of October 31 \u2014 when Johnson has vowed to end the country\u2019s 46 years of EU membership with or without an agreement.\n\nWith the EU asking for reworked proposals within days, an Elysee Palace spokesperson said Macron agreed in his call with Johnson that talks between EU top negotiator Michel Barnier\u2019s team and British officials should continue in the coming days \u201cto assess if an agreement is possible\u201d by the end of the week.\n\nBarclay reiterated that the ideas Johnson has formally submitted to Brussels were \u201ca broad landing zone\u201d and \u201cintense negotiations\u201d were now necessary.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve set out very serious proposals including compromise on our side,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\n\u201cWe do need to get into the intensive negotiations on the text to clarify what the deal is.\u201d\n\nBarclay added the government was considering holding a parliamentary vote ahead of the EU summit to show Brussels the plans have MPs\u2019 support.\n\nEuropean leaders had reportedly balked at Britain\u2019s request to keep initial discussions on the proposals going through the weekend, and they will resume on Monday, with time running out ahead of the EU summit.\n\n\u2013 \u2018No more dither\u2019 \u2013\n\nJohnson began phoning European leaders at the weekend to sell his proposals, speaking to Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Saturday.\n\nRutte tweeted he had told Johnson \u201cimportant questions remain about the British proposals\u201d and \u201cthere is a lot of work to be done ahead\u201d of the summit.\n\nBarnier told an event in France Saturday that while an agreement was still possible it \u201cwill be very difficult to reach\u201d.\n\nThe British leader is hoping the threat of a messy no-deal departure in less than three weeks could force the EU to compromise.\n\nBarclay said Sunday that the government would comply with the legislation requiring Johnson to seek another delay if no deal is reached.\n\nBut in identical articles for two Brexit-backing British tabloids, Johnson insisted the country will leave the bloc later this month.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Ready to work\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe British proposals submitted to Brussels Wednesday centre on how to manage the post-Brexit border between British province Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.\n\nJohnson wants Northern Ireland\u2019s devolved assembly \u2014 which has been suspended for almost three years \u2014 to vote every four years on whether to maintain EU rather than British regulations there.\n\nHe has also proposed the province leaves the EU\u2019s customs union along with the rest of the UK, with required checks to rely on untried technology and carried out away from the sensitive border.\n\nBrussels has said the plans \u201cdo not provide a basis for concluding an agreement\u201d.\n\nIt sees the potential for rampant smuggling while Ireland is concerned hardline Northern Irish unionists would have an effective veto.\n\nBarclay, who travelled to Amsterdam Sunday for Brexit talks, suggested Britain could be willing to consider alternative ways of meeting its aims.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready to work on that,\u201d he said.\n\nIreland\u2019s leader Leo Varadkar said Saturday there is \u201cplenty of time\u201d to put forward alternatives and he was trying to arrange a meeting with Johnson next week, Irish broadcaster RTE reported.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned the European Union on Sunday he will not delay Brexit beyond October 31, underlining that", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/07599d_johnson-insists-britain-leave-eu-or-deal-end-month-he-is-required-by-law-seek-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
