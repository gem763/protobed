That Act protects gun manufacturers from lawsuits tied to firearms that were legally manufactured and legally sold.\n\nHe said, \u201cNo other outfit in history has gotten this kind of protection,\u201d and he claimed the suits would result in \u201cchange overnight.\u201d\n\nBiden did not say whether Ford, Chevrolet, Toyota, Ferrari, or others, should be open to lawsuits when one of their legally manufactured and sold products is stolen and used in a crime.\n\nIn addition to suing gun manufacturers, Biden wants to ban the manufacture and sale of AR-15s and require registration of the AR-15s that are already in circulation. Breitbart News reported that Biden also wants to register ammunition magazines.\n\nBiden also argued that gun owners ought to be liable if they do not keep their firearms \u201cunder lock and key.\u201d\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
