So a lot of damage is being done to the system with long term consequences.\u201d\n\nOther experts in the foreign policy field agree with Gardner.\n\nKristen Boon, a law professor at Seton Hall University, argued that the U.S. shift away from multilateralism and international organizations \u2014 established in the aftermath of World War II \u2014 \u201dsignals a shift away from engagement and cooperation that may put us on a path towards future domestic and international unrest.\u201d\n\nTrump has followed an \u201cAmerica first\u201d policy, ditching multilateral treaties and pursued a unilateral strategy against China with the trade war.\n\nDonald Trump, President of the USA, speaks at the closing press conference of the G7 summit on 26 August 2019, in Biarritz, France.
