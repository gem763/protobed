I stopped at Barrels and Barrels the day of the drawing and almost walked out without buying the tickets, but at the last minute, I decided to get four plays,\u201d he said.\n\nThe next day, his wife, Dawn, said her sister told her someone who went to the store had won the Powerball jackpot.\n\n\u201cMy first thought was: \u2018He better have bought some tickets!\u201d his wife recalled.\n\nWhen she told him the news, Chippewa ran out to his truck where he had left the tickets and got a huge surprise.\n\nHe continued:\n\nI ran out to take a look at them and I didn\u2019t have to look past the first line to see I was the winner. Of course, my wife and son thought I was playing a trick, so my son pulled the numbers up on his phone and read them out loud while Dawn and I looked at the ticket together. By the time he was done, we both had tears in our eyes.\n\nChippewa said he wanted to confirm that he was the winner, so he drove back over to the Barrels and Barrels store to have the ticket scanned.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we walked in the clerk asked: \u2018Are you guys the big winners?\u2019 I handed him the ticket and said: \u2018We\u2019re about to find out.\u2019 When the terminal printed a receipt saying to contact the Lottery, we knew our lives had changed.\u201d\n\nHowever, Chippewa said winning the jackpot was not going to change who he and his wife are as a couple.\n\n\u201cMy wife and I have been together for 25 years, we\u2019ve always helped others and we\u2019re both still working,\u201d he commented.\n\n\u201cEvery day when I come to work my boss asks me: \u2018Why are you here?\u2019 I just tell him that I was hired to do a job and I\u2019m not going to abandon anyone just because I won. We\u2019ll both retire in time, but we believe in being good to the community that has been so good to us.\u201d\n\nChippewa will receive his winnings as a one-time lump sum of $55.3 million which comes to about $42 million after taxes. He plans to buy new homes for himself and his children and share the rest of the money with his loved ones.\n\n\u201cWith seven children and 21 grandchildren, I\u2019ve always said that I might not have the most money, but I am rich with family. Now, I have all the money I\u2019ll ever need and can help my family for generations. That means everything to me,\u201d he concluded.", "description": "A man with seven kids and 21 grandkids is now richer than ever after he won $80 million in the Powerball jackpot in September.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/lottery-winner-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
