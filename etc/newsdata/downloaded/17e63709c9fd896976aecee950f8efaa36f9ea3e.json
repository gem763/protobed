Further, we have reason to believe there is an Indiana connection to these remains,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nHill\u2019s statement did not elaborate on what specifically would be investigated. Raoul\u2019s office said it has agreed to assist Hill with contacting authorities in Illinois.\n\nThe Will County Sheriff\u2019s Office in northeastern Illinois announced late Friday that Klopfer\u2019s relatives had discovered 2,246 preserved fetal remains while sorting through his property. The county coroner\u2019s office has taken possession of those remains, and it, the sheriff\u2019s department and local prosecutors were already investigating.\n\nHill\u2019s announcement came after several Indiana lawmakers called for his office to investigate whether the remains were illegally transported across state lines. Lawmakers are also seeking a probe of the shuttered clinics in Allen, Lake and St. Joseph\u2019s counties where Klopfer had performed abortions to make sure no fetal remains are being stored at the former clinics in Fort Wayne, Gary and South Bend.\n\nIndiana state Rep. Ron Bacon, a Chandler Republican, called the discovery at Klopfer\u2019s home \u201cseriously disturbing.\u201d He also expressed concern that \u201cthere may be other remains in the Indiana clinics where he performed abortions.\u201d\n\nSeveral Indiana lawmakers held a news conference Monday outside Klopfer\u2019s former clinic in Fort Wayne, the county seat of northeastern Indiana\u2019s Allen County, calling for multiple state investigations.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of work to do to make sure this never, ever happens again,\u201d said Republican Sen. Liz Brown of Fort Wayne.\n\nRepublican Gov. Eric Holcomb issued a statement saying he was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the discovery of the fetal remains and that he supports \u201ccalls for a federal investigation.\u201d His statement followed Republican U.S. Rep. Jackie Walorski\u2019s request Saturday that state and federal authorities \u201cconduct a full investigation into this case and take any steps necessary to protect Hoosiers, including the unborn, from unsafe practitioners.\u201d\n\nKlopfer was believed to be Indiana\u2019s most prolific abortion doctor, performing thousands of procedures over several decades, the South Bend Tribune reported.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in May upheld a 2016 Indiana law requiring burial or cremation of fetal remains after an abortion. Before that, clinics could turn over fetal remains to processors who handle disposal of human tissues or other medical material by incineration.\n\nHowever, Klopfer\u2019s clinics in Fort Wayne, Gary and South Bend closed years before his death.\n\nThe state revoked the South Bend clinic\u2019s license in 2015. The Indiana State Department of Health had previously issued complaints against the clinic, accusing it of lacking a registry of patients, policies regarding medical abortion, and a governing body to determine policies. The agency also accused the clinic of failing to document that patients get state-mandated education at least 18 hours before an abortion.\n\nKlopfer\u2019s license was suspended by Indiana\u2019s Medical Licensing Board in November 2016 after it found a number of violations, including a failure to ensure that qualified staff was present when patients received or recovered from medications given before and during abortion procedures.\n\nKlopfer was no longer practicing by that time, but he told the panel he had never lost a patient in 43 years of doing abortions.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Indiana's attorney general said Monday that he will work with his Illinois counterpart to investigate what he called the \"grisly discovery\" of more than 2,000 medically preserved fetal remains at the Illinois home of a late doctor who performed abortions in Indiana.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rick Callahan"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/fetal_remains_doctor_95978_c74-0-2000-1123_s1770x1032.jpg?4019589b94b1b4b8f56e50b4f14bcb23193c1bbe", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
