The reason they win so often is that the burden of proof falls on the taxpayer \u2013 and without consistent documentation, this can be a difficult burden to meet.\"\n\nMr Paterson said the crackdown would hit property developers who did not subdivide farmland appropriately before commencing development.\n\n\"Take for example, if you have a five-hectare former primary production site and you commence development before subdividing the land, then you may no longer be eligible for an exemption on the entirety of that site,\" he said.\n\nIn the case of trusts, Mr Paterson said all discretionary trusts, unless worded otherwise, were generally considered to fall under the definition of a foreign person and thus liable for the land tax surcharge of 2 per cent.\n\n\"This may be a surprise to families and small companies, as well as individuals from other jurisdictions who have a different definition of foreign resident for the purposes of land tax,\" he said.\n\nTax expert Matthew Cridland, a partner at law firm K &L Gates, said incorrect claims of the primary production land tax exemption was an area where the firm typically saw taxpayer errors arise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The primary production use must be of a substantial commercial scale and undertaken with a profit-making intention,\" Mr Cridland said.\n\n\"In this scenario, hobby farms or running a few cattle to keep the grass down won\u2019t suffice.\"\n\nRevenue NSW has given taxpayers a three-month amnesty until January 31 to disclose landholdings and avoid penalty interest charges.\n\nMr Paterson advised those potentially liable for land tax to act now given much of the amnesty period covered the busy end of year and Christmas and New Year holidays.", "description": "Property developers who commence development before subdividing their land could be liable for land tax, warns Grant Thornton.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.7685%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d36db273b165c9efcdca3727fadcc0360830a86e", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
