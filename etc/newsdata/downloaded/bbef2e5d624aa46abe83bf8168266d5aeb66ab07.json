Image Kaufland.\n\nAldi has enjoyed its challenger status against Woolies and Coles, but that could change with a new German player coming to town.\n\nKaufland is opening in Australia bringing a \u201cone stop shop model\u201d with it, the Australian Financial Review reported.\n\n\u201cKaufland is a one-stop destination shop,\u201d Kaufland Australia Managing Director Julia Kern told the AFR.\n\n\u201cIt means that we offer the best of both worlds,\u201d she added, referring to it being a supermarket that also offers general merchandise and a private label range.\n\nFrozen food. Image, Kaufland.\n\nAccording to the Sydney Morning Herald, Kaufland is a cross between a supermarket and a Kmart, bringing your favourite grocery items along with other items like bikes and maintenance supplies.\n\nProfessor Gary Mortimer from the Queensland University of Technology Business School summed it up by describing Kaufland as an \u201cAldi on steroids\u201d, in a Nine News report.\n\nImage Kaufland.\n\nKaufland is headquartered in Melbourne, with offices in Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide. Earlier this year it announced plans to build a giant $459 million warehouse in Melbourne, measuring 110,000 square meters, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.\n\nLike Aldi, Kaufland also hails from Germany. It is a subsidiary of Schwarz Group \u2013 the fourth largest retailer in the world.\n\nSince it was founded in 1984, it has grown to operate nearly 1,300 stores and employ around 150,000 workers in seven European countries.\n\nThe company plans to open 30 stores in Australia and has nearly 50 trademarks registered with IP Australia including logos and brand names, according to Nine News.\n\nAnd like Aldi, Kaufland has brand names you\u2019ve likely never heard of.\n\nThe brand names \u201cMidorea\u201d and \u201cBevola\u201d cover products such as pharmaceuticals, hair care and cosmetics, while non-alcoholic beverages are under the brand name \u201cAparacino\u201d, Nine News reported.\n\nKaufland also has other registered names with the letter K, such as K Organic, K Favourites and K Free, Nine reported. It is also set to sell a combination of Australian produce and cheap home brands.\n\nImage Kaufland.\n\nThe biggest difference between Aldi and Kaufland comes down to the sheer size. Kaufland stores are massive, typically measuring up to 20,000 square meters with 300 car spaces, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. That is about 15 times bigger than Aldi and five times bigger than a large Woolies or Coles, news.com.au reported.\n\nNot only are Kaufland stores bigger \u2013 they also have much more stock.\n\nWhile Aldi stocks around 1300 different items \u2013 most which are their own brands \u2013 Kaufland has around 30,000 products including fresh produce, meat, general merchandise, hardware, clothing and homewares, according to the AFR.\n\nAldi opened its first store in 1913 and now has more than 10,000 store locations around the world.\n\nIt opened its first store in Australia back in 2001 and now has more than 500 stores around the country, challenging the dominance of Coles and Woolworths.\n\n\u201cOver the first half of the past five-year period, the rapid expansion of ALDI significantly altered the [supermarket and grocery] industry\u2019s operating landscape, with the popularity of its low-cost private-label products underpinning strong growth,\u201d IBISWorld noted.\n\n\u201cALDI\u2019s rise forced the two established industry giants, Woolworths and Coles, to cut prices and expand their private-label product ranges in response.\u201d\n\nWhile Woolworths has retained its spot as Australia\u2019s top grocery retailer, Roy Morgan research indicated an increase in Aldi\u2019s marketshare. It said that Aldi \u201chad a good year in 2018\u201d, growing its market share by 0.5% to 11.4%.\n\nWith Kaufland\u2019s entry, only time will tell which retailer will reign supreme.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
