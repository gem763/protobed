Meanwhile, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) once again demonstrated its strong support in the east of the country by surging ahead to finish second at 23.4 percent, more than doubling its vote share in the last election of 2014.\n\nThe election dealt a serious blow to establishment, centrist parties including Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and her national coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD). The CDU was knocked into third place at 21.8 percent \u2014 down from first place in 2014 \u2014 while the SPD came far behind in fourth place at about 8 percent.\n\nThe Greens and liberal Free Democrats (FDP) won about 5 percent each, enough to scrape past the necessary threshold of votes for the state legislature.\n\nThe ballot in the state of a little more than 2 million is expected to have limited impact at national level as Thuringia is a rural region of small towns rather than teeming metropolises. However, the result means efforts to build a coalition will be fraught, testing party red lines. The prior coalition made up of Die Linke, the SPD and the Greens now falls short of a majority.\n\nImmediately after the results were announced, the CDU's Secretary-General Paul Ziemiak ruled out forming a coalition with Die Linke or the AfD. An unwieldy four-way coalition of Die Linke, the SPD, the Greens and the FDP would also fall short of a majority.\n\nAll parties have ruled out working with the AfD. Its regional leader, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, is a right-wing firebrand whose controversial statements about the Nazi era have prompted some within the party to try to oust him from its ranks.\n\nThis article has been updated.", "description": "Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives knocked down from first to third place in east German state of Thuringia.", "authors": ["Joshua Posaner", "Rym Momtaz", "Matthew Karnitschnig"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1178457958-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
