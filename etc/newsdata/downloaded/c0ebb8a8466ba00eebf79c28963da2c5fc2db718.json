Previously, it only had a 'connect' button.\n\nAnd now the notification also displays the device name and category when that information is available.\n\nThe Bluetooth pairing notifications currently work with Microsoft products, including the Surface Ergonomic Keyboard, Surface Precision Mouse, Microsoft Modern Mobile Mouse, Surface Mobile Mouse, Microsoft Arc Mouse, Surface Arc Mouse, and Surface Headphones.\n\nThe new notification is rolling out to half of all users on the Windows Insider Fast ring and will roll out to additional users in future.\n\nMicrosoft is also working on improvements for optional updates, such as drivers, feature updates, and monthly non-security quality updates.\n\nAll new updates will be listed in 'View optional updates' in Settings. Microsoft notes that Windows Update will automatically keep drivers up to date, but optional drivers could help solve a problem.\n\nWindows 10 users can test the features by joining the Windows Insider Fast ring. The update otherwise is scheduled for release around April 2020.\n\nThe Windows 10 screenshot tool Snip & Sketch version 10.1907 is now coming to all Insiders in the Release Preview Ring as well as to some users on the mainstream release.\n\nThe update brings a single window mode as the default setting, but users can change that in settings if they like multiple windows. There's also zoom support to help users make notes or sketch on images that are too small.\n\nThere's a host of bug fixes in this update too, including one that resulted in Task Manager showing \"an unexpectedly high temperature for certain GPUs\".\n\nAnother bug that caused the setting for a device to go passwordless by requiring Windows Hello sign-ins was showing for local account users. Now it only shows for Microsoft account users.\n\nMicrosoft has fixed a bug affecting the Reset a PC via cloud download option, which wasn't working when some optional features were installed.\n\nMore on Microsoft's Windows 10 20H1 update", "description": "Microsoft latest Windows 10 preview of the 20H1 update offers more thoughtful notifications for Bluetooth pairing.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/20/ea969b88-d885-4179-b5a2-cc3e4f6212d2/thumbnail/770x578/6b414647d91a5d3aebfe2a52015d2bea/laptopheadphonesistock-950119056.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
