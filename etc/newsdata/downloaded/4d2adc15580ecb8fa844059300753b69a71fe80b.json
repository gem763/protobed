Abdul-Majeed Marouf Ahmed Alani was charged with \"willfully damaging, destroying or disabling an aircraft\" for blocking the ADM with a piece of foam.\n\nThe mechanic, Alani, told authorities he was trying to get some overtime pay by causing a delay, and was not trying to hurt the passengers or the plane.\n\nAlani was apparently disgruntled with American Airlines as a result of a lengthy dispute between the carrier and its two mechanics unions. The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline has previously accused members of the mechanics unions of purposely doing their work slowly to obtain leverage in contract negotiations.\n\nPassengers on the affected flight boarded a new aircraft, and the plane that had been tampered with was taken out of service, American Airlines said. The aircraft was returned to service after maintenance and an inspection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFILE - In this Jan. 25, 2016, file photo, a passenger talks on the phone as American Airlines jets sit parked at their gates at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Va.
