His Washington-based attorney did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\n\"He is seriously considering a campaign,\" said a Republican operative familiar with Sessions's thinking, who stressed that whoever Republicans nominate is set to defeat Senator Doug Jones, Democrat of Alabama, widely considered to be the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent facing re-election next year given the GOP dominance of Alabama and strong support in the state for President Trump.\n\nSessions vacated the seat to become President Trump's first attorney general. Mr. Trump, unhappy with Sessions' recusal from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, ultimately forced him to resign the day after the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nOther people confirmed Sessions is thinking about a campaign.\n\nNews of Sessions's interest in the race was first reported by Politico.\n\nJones is seeking a full term, after winning his seat in late 2017 in a race that drew global attention because of allegations of sexual misconduct and assault against Republican candidate Roy Moore. He admitted to relationships with younger women when he was in his 30s, but denied ever assaulting anyone.\n\nSessions has until November 8 to file paperwork to run. If he joins the fray, he would face five other Republican contenders: Moore, who is trying yet again, plus Representative Bradley Byrne, former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill and State Representative Arnold Mooney.\n\nEleanor Watson contributed to this report.", "description": "He was forced to resign as attorney general after the 2018 midterm elections", "authors": ["Ed O'Keefe"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/29/e0133cca-071a-4684-a5f6-df2e30470c14/thumbnail/1200x630g2/eb97877fcd651c56897d1febb7c698c5/gettyimages-1056083428.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
