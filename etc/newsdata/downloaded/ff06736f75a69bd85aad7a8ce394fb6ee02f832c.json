However, I believe the St. Louis righty has the best combination of matchup, salary, and current form of that group. Flaherty has been dealing lately, allowing just three earned runs over his past seven starts (46 IP). He\u2019ll face a subpar Pittsburgh offense in pitcher-friendly PNC Park, which feeds the DFS rationale even more.\n\nAlso Consider: Max Scherzer, Noah Syndergaard\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nDanny Santana - Texas (at Baltimore)\n\nStory continues\n\nThe first base position is competitive this afternoon, but Santana jumps off the screen as a welcoming mid-range selection. It seems that any hitter with a pulse is in fantasy consideration against this terrible Orioles\u2019 pitching staff, but Santana has proven upside while enjoying a career season with 24 homers supported by a respectable .286 average. The Rangers\u2019 switch-hitter will look to exploit the .389 wOBA split (to LHB) of Baltimore RHP Asher Wojciechowski, and the Orioles\u2019 bullpen should put up much resistance either.\n\nAlso Consider: Jose Abreu, Joey Votto\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nRobinson Cano - NY Mets (vs. Philadelphia)\n\nGood ol\u2019 Robbie Cano is back at it again, posting 13 hits with two homers and four doubles over his last six starts. He\u2019ll take that heater into a favorable draw against Philadelphia RHP Vince Velasquez, who has surrendered 13 earned runs across 15.2 innings over his most recent four appearances. On top of that, the Phillies hurler owns a vulnerable .364 wOBA split to left-handed bats. Cano, Jeff McNeil, Michael Conforto, and other NYM lefties are firmly in consideration as a result.\n\nAlso Consider: Jose Altuve, Rougned Odor\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nEduardo Escobar - Arizona (at Cincinnati)\n\nThird base is usually an embarrassment of riches for any daily fantasy slate of 10 or more games. However, I had trouble finding legitimate options in favorable spots for reasonable salaries this afternoon. Escobar is one of the few lifts who checked those boxes, as he\u2019ll face Reds\u2019 RHP Anthony DeSclafani (.369 wOBA vs. LHB) in hitter-friendly Great American Ballpark.\n\nAlso consider: Yoan Moncada, Abraham Toro\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nTim Anderson - Chicago White Sox (vs. LA Angels)\n\nI\u2019m trying to make Alex Bregman fit into my lineup, but that doesn\u2019t seem likely without sacrificing other positions. Anderson checks in as a comfortable fallback play, and I really like his contact/speed/power upside. The non-imposing salary doesn\u2019t hurt either. Anderson will step in against LA Angels\u2019 RHP Jaime Barria, who currently holds an inflated .369 wOBA split to right-handed bats.\n\nAlso Consider: Alex Bregman, Paul DeJong\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nShohei Ohtani - LA Angels (vs. Chicago White Sox)\n\nOhtani came through in the first two games of this series, racking up five hits with two doubles, one triple, one homer, and five RBIs. He\u2019s in a \u201csmash spot\u201d yet again while facing White Sox RHP Dylan Cease, who carries a .392 wOBA split to left-handed bats. Making matters even better, Ohtani\u2019s salary remains low following a prolonged cold streak before this weekend series at Chicago. He\u2019s certainly snapped out of that, and I\u2019m expecting Ohtani to keep things going in this Sunday afternoon draw.\n\nJosh Reddick - Houston (vs. Seattle)\n\nReddick doesn\u2019t have promising career numbers against Seattle RHP Felix Hernandez, but we can all agree that this isn\u2019t the same Cy Young caliber pitcher of previous seasons. In fact, the Astros represent the highest run-scoring projection of the main slate while facing Hernandez at home. Reddick is a cheap lift within that despite heating up to the tune of five hits and two homers over his last three starts.\n\nAlso consider: Yordan Alvarez, Michael Brantley, Tommy Pham, Willie Calhoun, Michael Conforto, Shin-Soo Choo, Jeff McNeil, Kole Calhoun", "description": "Spencer Limbach runs through the best MLB DFS Plays of the afternoon slate (1:05 ET) on Sunday, September 8.
