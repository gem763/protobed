A recent update for its Google Nest app \u2014 where users can control the company\u2019s recently rebranded line of smart home products \u2014 hints at upcoming festive themes, the first of which appears to be some frightening new ringtones for the Nest Hello Doorbell.\n\nEditor's Note: Whether this feature is also coming to Australian Nest users is currently unconfirmed.\n\nFirst spotted by 9to5 Google, an app update this week lays the groundwork for a \u201cSeasonal themes\u201d section in the Nest Hello Doorbell settings. In that section, it seems users will eventually be able to choose an option to change their device\u2019s default ring for when visitors come-a-knocking to a new \u201cSpooky sounds\u201d theme. Google hasn\u2019t announced when this option will become available to customers, but chances are it\u2019ll be sooner rather than later. I mean, Halloween is less than two weeks away. Hurry up, guys.\n\nAccording to 9to5 Google, it looks like this spooky, scary skeletons theme can also be applied to other Google Assistant-enabled devices you may have lying around the house, like the Nest Hub Max or Nest Mini, provided they have visitor announcements enabled.\n\nThere\u2019s also no word from Google yet concerning what exactly these \u201cSpooky sounds\u201d will be. We\u2019ve reached out to Google to see if they can let us in on the details, but in the meantime, I also have a few suggestions for some truly terrifying tones they may want to consider:\n\nYour morning alarm. The default \u201cding\u201d of a new Slack notification when you\u2019re trying to enjoy your weekend. A recording of your local congressperson just wanting to remind you about the election coming up in your district soon and how you can show your support by \u2014 (I\u2019ve usually hung up by this point, so I\u2019m not actually sure how they wrap up these incessant \u201cget out to vote\u201d pitches). Or better yet, a recording of that annoying robocall voice saying literally anything. That little techno-y jingle from Fortnite\u2019s \u201cDance Moves\u201d emote. On loop. And it only stops when you answer the door.\n\nHonestly, though, I\u2019m not sure why Google\u2019s bothering with a Halloween theme for the Nest Hello at all. Hearing my doorbell ring in the first place is enough to shoot my anxiety through the roof.", "description": "It seems like Google\u2019s getting into the Halloween spirit.
