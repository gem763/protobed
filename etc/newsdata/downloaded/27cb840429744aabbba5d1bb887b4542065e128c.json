Belichick was using the hot tub and got up to exit so Edelman could have some privacy.\n\nThat's when Edelman got an unwelcome surprise: Belichick was completely naked.\n\nIn Belichick's defense, Edelman said this happened late at night when everybody had already gone home. Clearly the legendary head coach thought he had the run of the place.\n\nBut be forewarned.
