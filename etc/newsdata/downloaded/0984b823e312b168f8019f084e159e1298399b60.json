And because Riot Games doesn't have enough things going on, they're making one of their own.\n\nAnnounced during the League of Legends 10th anniversary stream among a literal avalanche of other things, League of Legends Esports Manager is basically exactly what it sounds like. The game, which will go live in China next year before expanding \"to other regional leagues\", will also feed back into the professional League circuit by sharing revenue with the real-life teams featured in-game.\n\n\"League of Legends Esports Manager is a team management game currently in development that will allow fans to assemble a world-class League of Legends esports teams as a team manager, signing players to contracts, and more,\" an official release said.\n\nNo footage of the game was available yet, and the monetisation model isn't known at this stage.
