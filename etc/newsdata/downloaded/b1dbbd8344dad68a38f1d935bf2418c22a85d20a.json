Instead of adding it in for free or making it part of a paid expansion, the developer is now selling a $12.99 monthly subscription it\u2019s calling Fallout 1st, which will grant access to premium features. In particular, the membership \u2014 Bethesda is calling it a membership and not a subscription \u2014 \u201coffers something players have been asking for since before launch: private worlds for you and select friends.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll get some other perks, too. There\u2019s a \u201cscrapbox\u201d storage container for holding unlimited materials, a monthly deposit of in-game Atoms currency for you to spend, exclusive outfits and other cosmetics, and a new fast-travel option called survival tent. Overall, these appear to be a mix of items you might normally spend real money on in any given month in Fallout 76, and the private world feature, which arguably is the only real benefit here.\n\nExcept that you have to buy all of this on a monthly basis, at $12.99 (or $100 for the year), which might be a big ask for a community that has dealt with plenty of bugs and scores of other issues since the game launched a year ago. The dedicated Fallout 76 subreddit is not enthused. Some early, impassioned threads include \u201cI can\u2019t even defend it\u201d and \u201cIs this an out-of-season April Fool\u2019s joke?\u201d and \u201cWow Bethesda just wow.\u201d Just for comparison, Apple Arcade, which has dozens of premium indie games for iOS and Mac, costs just $4.99 a month. Xbox Game Pass, which has brand-new Microsoft-produced titles like Gears 5 and more than 100 other games included, costs just $9.99 a month.\n\nAt the very least, there are some positives here. Bethesda says you\u2019ll be able to keep all cosmetics even if you stop paying for Fallout 1st, although access to your own private world requires you to have the subscription. You\u2019ll also still be able to access the scrapbox if you don\u2019t renew, but won\u2019t be able to put any new items in there. Not sure that\u2019s going to sway players one way or the other, but at least it makes it slightly more palatable to pay more than a subscription to Xbox Live or PSN \u2014 and just $2 less than a full-on World of Warcraft subscription \u2014 for the right to use a single feature in a single video game.", "description": "Bethesda is taking a rather unique approach to adding new in-game content for its multiplayer survival shooter Fallout 76.
