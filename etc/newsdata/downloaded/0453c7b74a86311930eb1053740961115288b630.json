In aviation, the winter season is defined as the five months from late October to late March.\n\nThe analyst Ralph Anker says the impact will be felt most strongly in North Africa: \u201cThomas Cook\u2019s failure has impacted capacity to Tunisia, down 40 per cent, and Egypt, down 30 per cent.\u201d\n\nThe collapse of Flybmi in February 2019 means the loss of 110,000 seats compared with last winter on short-haul links from regional airports.\n\nBut much more significant is the one-seventh reduction in the size of Flybe\u2019s operations, year on year. The airline, which is being rebranded as Virgin Connect, will cut 600,000 seats.\n\nFlybe is closing operations at Doncaster-Sheffield airport, and cutting links to the continent from Birmingham, Manchester and Southampton.\n\nRyanair is cutting 265,000 seats this winter. Last winter, the carrier flew four times a day between Stansted and Edinburgh; for the summer season that dropped to four flights a week; and now the route has been cut completely, leaving easyJet as the only player on the route.\n\nRyanair has blamed uncertainty over Brexit for shrinking its UK operation, which will be 3 per cent smaller this winter than last.\n\nIts main rival, easyJet, is showing a very small increase of 0.7 per cent, adding 84,000 seats.\n\nSome of the gaps within the UK and Europe are being filled with sharp increases in seats provided by three UK airlines: British Airways, Jet2 and Loganair, which are adding 1.2 million seats between them this winter.\n\nBritish Airways will grow by 4.5 per cent, adding 560,000 seats. And Jet2, based at Leeds Bradford airport, is putting on an extra 330,000 \u2013 a rise of 22 per cent.\n\nWay ahead, though, is the Scottish airline, Loganair, which is growing by two-thirds \u2013 adding 280,000 seats.\n\nThere are some fresh Loganair links, such as Edinburgh to Stavanger and Bergen in Norway. But much of the growth comes from picking up routes that larger airlines have dropped, such as Flybe\u2019s former links from East Midlands to Edinburgh and Glasgow.\n\nEastern Europe is a key growth area. Wizz Air, based in Hungary, is increasing its seat capacity to and from the UK by one-sixth, adding 310,000 seats. Routes from Luton to both Moscow and St Petersburg opened this month.\n\nNew airlines in the UK this winter compared with last winter include Albawings of Albania, Flybosnia and Montenegro Airlines.\n\nThe UK airport with the highest growth is Southend, up 42 per cent, while traffic in Aberdeen is expected to grow by 11 per cent.\n\nThe city that is the biggest loser is Belfast \u2013 where the International airport is 14 per cent down, and George Best Belfast City loses 8 per cent.\n\nEast Midlands, which was particularly hit by the collapse of Flybmi, also loses 8 per cent.\n\n\u201cOverall, UK capacity is, amazingly, virtually unchanged, despite the failures,\u201d said Ralph Anker.", "description": "Higher fares and less choice: that is the winter outlook for many travellers following airline collapses and contractions.
