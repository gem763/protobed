All the pieces off the pitch are coming together too, so fingers crossed it just keeps getting better and better.'\n\nSmalling has said that his experience in Italy have already exceeded his expectations\n\nSmalling also drew comparisons between Italian football and the way the game is played and organised in England.\n\n'In terms of the facilities and the schedules it is not too dissimilar [to England]. Like at United, here we are playing every few days so training in the week is more tactical and about recovery, rather than long training sessions.\n\n'But in terms of the games, especially watching more Serie A since I've been here and studying the opposition, I think compared to England you have a lot more teams who are playing with two central forwards, who are causing you a lot more problems.\n\n'In England quite often you have to deal with just one striker, so you've got your other central defender covering you \u2013 whereas often here you can be left two-on-two a lot of the time. There's a lot more runs in behind being made too.\n\nThe England international said that he is beginning to feel more settled and will move home\n\n'So it's definitely new challenges, which I'm enjoying \u2013 because I quite like a tussle and a sprint against the striker. It definitely suits my game.'\n\nSmalling detailed a phone call he had with Paulo Fonseca that convinced him to move away on loan from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side and to embrace a new challenge abroad.\n\n'I find it's been brilliant [with Fonseca]. In terms of our first conversation, I spoke to him on the phone from Manchester and he was just explaining the type of defender he wants, how he saw my attributes and how he wanted me to play within his team.\n\nSmalling detailed a conversation he had with Roma boss Paulo Fonseca before joining\n\n'And that gave me a real sense of things, and as soon as I was off the phone it was a case of, 'Let's make this happen'. And since then it has been great to work with him.'\n\nThe 29-year-old commented on the state of racism in Italian football, with high profile incidents involving former team-mate Romelu Lukaku casting a shadow over the game in Italy.\n\n'Honestly, on the pitch I have not noticed anything \u2013 although I'm still picking up the language! I've not experienced it directly, but obviously you do see what's in the news.\n\nThe Man United loanee shared his thoughts on racism after incidents with Romelu Lukaku\n\n'But I don't think it is just a problem in Italy, I think we are getting more cases in England too. It seems to be very much a generational thing that I think definitely needs to be clamped down on.\n\n'I think we are getting closer to the type of sanctions that there need to be, and they need to be harsh.\n\n'But hopefully they can single out the ones that are unwilling to change, and then hopefully the new generation \u2013 like my boy, and other younger kids \u2013 don't grow up seeing it and thinking it's right.'", "description": "Smalling had a slow start to life with his new club as he attempted to maintain match fitness levels, but has slotted in well to Fonseca's side and won plaudits for his performances.", "authors": ["Ollie Lewis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/23/19610160-0-image-a-25_1570832818161.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
