Technology conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp., already WeWork\u2019s largest investor, could also add more equity under the JP Morgan financing, these people add.\n\nOne major financial player that won\u2019t likely be part of the financing is Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., which along with JPMorgan attempted to bring WeWork public in an ill-fated initial public offering last month that was plagued not only by weak financials, but by tales of lax corporate governance and overspending by former CEO Adam Neumann.\n\nGoldman participated in a previous debt financing, but barring a last-minute change, Goldman is signaling to JP Morgan it will not be part of the lending group. The big investment bank announced it took an $80 million write-down following the IPO disaster, disclosing the information during its earnings call this week.\n\nA Goldman spokeswoman had no comment.\n\nAs of press time Thursday evening, it could not be determined if JPMorgan had come up with the necessary money for the massive bank loan. The big bank may wait until the weekend to make its presentation to WeWork\u2019s board if it believes the additional time will help raise it to raise the necessary funds for the $5 billion loan, and as it sets a coupon-rate for the debt of between 9 percent and 15 percent, the people add. A JP Morgan spokesman declined comment.\n\nThe JPMorgan deal is said to be the one preferred by WeWork management and many investors because it would leave current management in place, and put the company on the road toward selling off non-core assets, while focusing on its main office leasing business and eventually returning to Wall Street with an IPO that would allow those investors to monetize their holdings.\n\nSome market watchers are optimistic JPMorgan will come through. \u201cI would suspect that JPM has a lot of high net worth people in their investment,\u201d Greg Kraut of K Property Group tells FOX Business. \u201cI would bet Jamie Dimon wouldn\u2019t let them go bankrupt and give them very favorable financing terms.\u201d\n\nBut if JPMorgan isn\u2019t successful, WeWork doesn\u2019t have many options other than to accept a financing plan by its largest investor, Masayoshi Son\u2019s SoftBank, in which the Japanese technology conglomerate would take a controlling stake in the company, these people say.\n\nAnd a Softbank investment may be of strategic importance as well. \u201cWhat kind of signal does it give to the market if the largest investor won\u2019t support it anymore?\u201d Harvard Business School Senior Lecturer Nori Gerardo Lietz tells FOX Business. \u201cThat condition is precedent to anyone else writing an equity check.\u201d\n\nSoftbank would prefer a long-term approach to rebuilding WeWork in a way that would delay any IPO for years and enable them to recoup their prior investment though it\u2019s extremely unlikely WeWork will ever return to the $47 billion valuation it was given by Softbank less than a year ago.\n\nToday, WeWork\u2019s estimated value is $10 billion or less. Another option for WeWork is to simply sell off its various parts, including the core leasing business, which some investors prefer because they believe the company\u2019s future is dim, these people say. Despite reports of a possible billion-plus lifeline, WeWork bonds continue to trade at depressed levels\u2014just 79 cents on the dollar\u2014signaling many investors believe the company could slip into bankruptcy restructuring.\n\nA WeWork spokeswoman had no comment.\n\nWeWork was forced to pull its IPO\u2014despite bankers at Goldman pitching valuations as high as $90 billion\u2014after investors began studying its high debt levels, massive losses and that it burned through mountains of cash in its government-mandated IPO document, known as a deal prospectus. Investors balked at the stock sale because they believed these issues were glossed over by the company\u2019s marketing pitches and by Neumann through years of savvy promotion. Many investors were worried that the company faced still undisclosed problems.\n\nSoftbank\u2019s investments in the company that began in 2017 also provided a boost of confidence that papered over these issues and Neumann\u2019s own questionable actions including cashing out roughly $700 million in his WeWork stock before the IPO.\n\nFollowing the botched IPO, Neumann stepped down as CEO to take on the role of non-executive chairman. He was replaced by co-CEOs Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham as JP Morgan began an intensive review of the company\u2019s business operation, and whether these operations were sound enough that investors would put money into the outfit as part of a broader restructuring.\n\nPeople close to Neumann say neither he nor the company is a subject of a regulatory probe over the collapse of the IPO and the company\u2019s financial disclosures. A spokeswoman for Neumann said the former CEO wants \u201cWhat\u2019s best for the company,\u201d but declined further comment.\n\nPeople at JPMorgan are said to believe that WeWork\u2019s core business of office leasing is one that has a future, even if it\u2019s still unclear if other banks share its enthusiasm. JPMorgan had been a regular lender to the company over the years, and its CEO Jamie Dimon developed a close relationship with Neumann.\n\nWeWork was launched in 2010 by Neumann who used splashy marketing campaigns and glib progressive sales pitches to elevate WeWork stature as something more than a company that leases office space to entrepreneurs and other businesses. Its clients were known as \u201cmembers\u201d and Neumann said the experience of working out of a WeWork space would \u201celevate the world\u2019s consciousness\u201d by providing people with community-minded atmosphere in its offices.\n\nWeWork soon became what\u2019s known on Wall Street as a \u201cunicorn,\u201d or a startup that is valued at more than $1 billion and is considered to have unlimited potential. During WeWork\u2019s ascendency, Neumann attracted a high-caliber following. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff called him a \u201cgreat entrepreneur.\u201d Neumann developed friendships with his main banker, Dimon and even celebrity investor Ashton Kutcher, who appeared with the former CEO in January on the business network CNBC to tout the WeWork success story.\n\nBut the company also attracted its share of skeptics, even if they weren\u2019t among the big Wall Street firms looking to make money underwriting its looming IPO. In the pre-IPO market, WeWork shares traded at deep discounts because of a lack of buyers willing to pay for shares that would match the much-touted $47 billion valuation that SoftBank attached to the company, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nEarlier in the year, Softbank raised eyebrows by investing just $2 billion into WeWork when analysts believed the investment would be higher. Some WeWork watchers believed the tech conglomerate was getting nervous about the company\u2019s prospect. A Softbank spokesman didn\u2019t return a call for comment.\n\nAnd while a number of options are still on the table, WeWork doesn\u2019t have much time. \u201cSomething will either happen or it won\u2019t\u2026 but it\u2019ll happen quickly,\u201d Lietz adds.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "WeWork's bankers are shopping a lifeline.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Adam-Neumann1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
