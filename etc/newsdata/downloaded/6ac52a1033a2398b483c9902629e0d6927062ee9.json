New contracts secured by this division year-to-date stood at S$1.9 billion, with close to 60 per cent of the new orders for LNG and renewables-related projects.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nKeppel Corp CEO Loh Chin Hua said the recent settlement agreement reached by Keppel O&M with Sete Brasil \"brings closure\" to the outstanding contracts for the construction of the six rigs.\n\nRevenue from the property division increased by S$205 million to S$385 million due mainly to higher revenue from property trading projects in China, Vietnam and Singapore.\n\nRevenue from the infrastructure business grew by S$68 million to S$742 million as a result of increased sales in the power and gas business and progressive revenue recognition from the Hong Kong Integrated Waste Management Facility project while revenue from investments rose by S$283 million to S$308 million due mainly to the consolidation of M1.\n\nMr Loh pointed out that the group's data centre business has become an important growth area.\n\n\"The injection of Keppel DC Singapore 4 into Keppel DC Reit reflects Keppel's business model and our ability to create value for different stakeholders by hunting as a pack. Over the past five years (2014-2018), the Keppel Group achieved earnings of about S$430 million from the data centre business, not including the approximately S$270 million premium over the carrying value of Keppel's stake in Keppel DC Reit,\" he said.\n\nEarnings per share for the three months to September fell to 8.8 Singapore cents from 12.5 cents. No dividend was recommended for the period, same as the previous corresponding period.\n\nFor the nine-month period, net profit fell 37 per cent to S$515 million on the back of a 26 per cent rise in revenue to S$5.4 billion.\n\nNet profit fell due to lower gains from en bloc sales and divestments. In the previous nine-month period for FY2018, Keppel benefited from the en bloc sales of development projects in China and Vietnam, as well as gains from the divestment of a commercial development in Beijing which amounted to S$544 million, the company said.\n\nKeppel Corp shares fell two Singapore cents or 0.3 per cent to close at S$5.96 on Thursday.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Companies & Markets - KEPPEL Corp's third-quarter net profit fell 30 per cent to S$159 million from a restated S$227 million a year ago, led by the absence of gains from divestment of a commercial development in Beijing and higher net interest expense. .
