Fort Worth woman killed by cop represented 'honor, integrity'", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE The officer who shot the 28-year-old woman was identified by police only as a white male who has been on the force for about 18 months. USA TODAY\n\nThe woman who was fatally shot through a window in her family's Texas home by a Fort Worth police officer was a college graduate, a pharmaceutical equipment sales representative and a loving daughter who had moved back home to help care for her ailing mother, family members say.\n\nAtatiana \"Tay\" Jefferson, 28, was playing video games with her 8-year-old nephew, Zion, when she was killed early Saturday after a neighbor called police because her doors had been open for hours deep into the night.\n\nJefferson family lawyer S. Lee Merritt said Jefferson graduated from Xavier University of Louisiana in 2014 with a degree in biology.\n\n\"Her mom had recently gotten very sick, so she was home taking care of the house and loving her life,\" Merritt said on a GoFundMe page he set up for the family that surpassed its $150,000 goal.\n\nAmber Carr, Jefferson's sister, is Zion's mother. Carr said her sister had been taking care of Zion while Carr was recovering from heart surgery.\n\n\"The relationship she had with my son was incredible,\" Carr told reporters Monday. \"She helped Zion every day get ready for school.\"\n\nBouquets of flowers and stuffed animals pile up Oct. 14, 2019, outside the Fort Worth home where Atatiana Jefferson, 28, was shot to death by a police officer.

The officer, who is white, served on the force for 18 months before resigning Monday. The shooting took place less than two weeks after former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger was convicted of murdering Botham Jean, a black man shot in 2018 as he ate ice cream in his home.\n\nAfter Guyger was sentenced, Jean's brother and the judge both hugged her. Marquis Jefferson said he won't be hugging his daughter's shooter.\n\n\u201cUnlike Botham Jean, I don\u2019t want no hug. That\u2019s my one and only daughter,\u201d Marquis said. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget that.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/14/fort-worth-shooting-who-is-atatiana-jefferson/3973946002/", "description": "Atatiana Jefferson, who was fatally shot in her Texas home,  was a college graduate, a pharmaceutical equipment sales rep and a loving daughter.", "authors": ["John Bacon", "Published P.M.
