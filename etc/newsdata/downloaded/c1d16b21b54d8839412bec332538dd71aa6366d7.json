It\u2019s a disgrace. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nTaylor declined to say why he thinks the prosecution went forward, but Craig\u2019s allies have grumbled for months that he was targeted in an effort to even the scales politically and to push back against perceptions that Mueller\u2019s operation was solely focused on allies of President Donald Trump.\n\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on Taylor\u2019s statements.\n\nTwo jurors who spoke with reporters had a somewhat different take on Craig\u2019s conduct than Taylor. They said the jury acquitted Craig because of what many would view as a technical issue.\n\nBecause of the statute of limitations applicable in the case, the judge told jurors that they could only find Craig guilty if prosecutors showed beyond a reasonable doubt that Craig concealed a material fact about his Ukraine work after Oct. 3, 2013. At least some jurors believed Craig had lied before that date, but they found a lack of proof he did so after that point, the two jurors said.\n\nAbout three hours into deliberations Wednesday, the jury sent out a question asking the judge to explain why the indictment referred to a scheme stretching from June 2013 to January 2014, but they were told only to convict Craig if he took steps to conceal something material after Oct. 3, 2013.\n\nJackson called in the jurors and told them the date was dictated by \u201ca legal issue which is outside the jury\u2019s concern.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on that very narrow thing, there wasn\u2019t anything that warranted a finding of guilt during that period,\u201d said Michael Meyer, 60. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\n\nA key piece of evidence in the case was an Oct. 10, 2013, letter Craig wrote. Prosecutors said it contained at least two flat-out lies, but the defense argued the statements were technically true.\n\nFor instance, Craig said he\u2019d only delivered the report to journalists who requested it. An email shown to the jury Sanger had asked for it, but only after Craig offered it to him.\n\nJurors appear to have seen those statements as successful evasions rather than outright falsehoods.\n\n\u201cIt was done in a very narrow, lawyerly way,\u201d Meyer said of the letter.\n\nAnother juror, Willie Wilson, 28, said the jury began its work with about half the jurors thinking Craig was guilty.\n\n\u201cIt was relatively evenly split in the outset,\u201d Wilson said. He added that jurors reached a consensus after the judge clarified the date issue. \u201cWe had to focus on the dates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of very clever wording, but we just did not see it as enough to find him guilty,\u201d Wilson added.\n\nWilson said he and others did believe Craig lied about his work on the Ukraine project, but it wasn\u2019t clear he did so during the window critical to the case.\n\n\u201cI was not of the opinion Greg Craig was a bad person, but he walked right up to the line and very well could have crossed it,\u201d the juror said. \u201cWe think the evidence proved that he did lie prior to Oct. 3.\u201d\n\nCraig grew red and appeared on the verge of tears moments after the court clerk read the \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict around 3 p.m. Wednesday. As the jurors entered the courtroom, only one seemed to look at Craig, but as the verdict was about to be read, nearly all of them turned to focus on him.\n\nCraig quickly exchanged hugs with several members of his defense team and visibly relieved family members, as well as longtime friend and fellow D.C. power lawyer, David Kendall.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Outside the courthouse, Craig made only a brief statement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to thank the jury for their service and for justice in this case. I\u2019m grateful to them in so many ways,\u201d Craig said, before thanking his friends and supporters as well as his defense team from law firm Zuckerman Spaeder. \u201cI want to thank my lawyers who made it all possible.\u201d\n\nCraig\u2019s handling of the so-called Tymoshenko Report was examined by the Justice Department soon after the review was released 2012, but came under fresh scrutiny by Mueller\u2019s prosecutors two years ago as they explored the overseas ties and work of Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\n\nManafort, a top adviser to Ukraine\u2019s then-president Viktor Yanukovych, played a key role in commissioning, funding and publicizing the report put together by Craig and colleagues at his law firm, Skadden Arps.\n\nCraig was interviewed twice by Mueller\u2019s prosecutors \u2014 once in October 2017 and again in February 2018. The inquiry into Craig and Skadden was then handed off to federal prosecutors in New York, where Skadden is headquartered.\n\nThe investigation was later transferred to prosecutors in Washington, who obtained an indictment of Craig in April on two counts: scheming to conceal facts in a federal investigation and making false statements in a Foreign Agent Registration Act filing.\n\nProsecutors alleged that in trying to convince the Justice Department in 2013 that he and Skadden should not be required to register as foreign agents of Ukraine, he lied to and misled officials about his role in distributing and publicizing the report.\n\nThe prosecution contended Craig was particularly deceptive about his actions to get an embargoed advance copy of the report to New York Times reporter David Sanger in December 2011.\n\nProsecutors stressed to the jury that Craig hand-delivered a copy of the 186-page report to Sanger\u2019s northwest Washington home and kept a public relations specialist for Ukraine informed of the dealings with the prominent New York Times national security correspondent.\n\nIn July, U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson dismissed one of the two charges, ruling that a letter Craig sent to the Justice Department in October 2013 could not have amounted to a false FARA filing since he never actually registered. That left Craig facing trial on a single felony count of using a \u201ctrick, scheme or device\u201d to conceal material facts from the federal government.\n\nCraig faced a maximum potential sentence of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 if convicted on the remaining count. It\u2019s unclear whether he would have actually been sentenced to prison if convicted, but any sentence would almost certainly have been far less than the maximum.\n\nCraig took the stand in his own defense, insisting that he never lied to or sought to mislead the government and that he genuinely did not believe he needed to register as a foreign agent. His argument was based in part on what Craig contended was an acrimonious and distrustful relationship with Manafort and with a firm Ukraine hired to publicize the report, FTI Consulting.\n\nCraig\u2019s defense alleged that the relationship grew so strained that in dealing with Sanger and other journalists, he was trying to counteract or preempt an aggressive spin job Manafort was overseeing to make the report sound like a ringing endorsement of the controversial prosecution of Tymoshenko.\n\nWhile Mueller secured guilty pleas from seven individuals, his office tried only one case in court: Manafort\u2019s trial last summer in Alexandria, Va., on charges of filing false tax returns and hiding foreign bank accounts. A jury convicted him on eight counts. He pleaded guilty to two more charges as part of a plea deal that headed off a planned second trial over foreign-agent registration.\n\nBefore Craig, the only other defendant to go to trial in a Mueller spinoff case was Bijan Rafiekian, an ex-business partner of former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nIn July, a jury in Alexandria convicted Rafiekian of acting as an unregistered foreign agent for Turkey and conspiring to make false statements to Justice\u2019s Foreign Agent Registration Unit in connection with work done through Flynn\u2019s consulting firm. Rafiekian has asked the judge to set aside the verdict.\n\n", "description": "Craig is the only Democratic appointee to be charged in a series of cases stemming from the Mueller probe.", "authors": ["Josh Gerstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/67/07/a120c5504e6aa1e9f890d0bc3c2a/20190904-greg-craig-fresh-gty-773.jpg"}
