(Raj Mehta / USA TODAY Sports )\n\nAndy Reid, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Johnny Paycheck, Tom Cruise, and more\n\nThe year is not yet over \u2014 we still have three more months, and two of them have 31 days \u2014 but I think I have my Comment of the Year. My Comment of 2019. It comes from Andy Reid, the head coach of the Kansas City Chiefs. After his team beat the Detroit Lions in rough fashion, he said, \u201cHey, not all of Mozart\u2019s paintings were perfect. . . . The end result, though: That sucker\u2019s gonna sell for a million dollars!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt reminded me of a line from a Dan Jenkins novel. I mean, if he had heard it, he would have incorporated it, somewhere. He could not have improved on it.\n\nI mentioned this to his daughter, Sally, the prizewinning sports columnist at the Washington Post. She had noticed the comment before I did. We got a huge kick out of it.\n\nSo, hats off to Coach Reid (and damn him for beating my Lions). (Damn the other teams, too.)\n\n\u2022 An article in the Guardian began as follows:\n\nDonald Trump disputed that Russia was behind the attempted murder of a former Russian spy in a tense call with Theresa May, it has emerged. Despite the widespread conclusion that Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime was behind the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia last year, the US president is said to have spent 10 minutes expressing his doubts about Russian involvement. According to the Washington Post, Trump \u201charangued\u201d May about Britain\u2019s contribution to Nato in a phone call with Britain\u2019s then prime minister in the summer of last year, before disputing Russian involvement in the Skripal case. \u201cTrump totally bought into the idea there was credible doubt about the poisoning,\u201d said a figure briefed on the call. \u201cA solid 10 minutes of the conversation is spent with May saying it\u2019s highly likely and him saying he\u2019s not sure.\u201d\n\nFor the complete article, go here. Do you doubt the Post\u2019s account? If so, you and I know different Donald Trumps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Russian embassy in London retweeted the Guardian article, saying, \u201cBest evidence that no evidence of Russian involvement exists.\u201d\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this is a time for choosing, as a future president once said (Ronald Reagan in 1964): Are you with the Kremlin and its various lies and machinations? Or with democratic forces that oppose all this?\n\n\u2022 Talking about the current furor in Washington, Putin said, \u201cThey have already been using any excuse to attack President Trump. Now it\u2019s Ukraine.\u201d Putin and Team Trump sound exactly alike. This does not mean they are wrong, mind you \u2014 but if I were a Trump man, and anti-Putin (which is possible, right?), I might blush a little.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 In 2017, I went to Sweden, to report on a particular development: That country is getting more serious, militarily, in response to a Putinized Russia. For my report, go here.\n\nA week ago, this report caught my eye. It was published in the Guardian, out of Gothenburg:\n\nSweden\u2019s navy HQ is returning to a vast underground cold war fortress designed to withstand a nuclear attack, in what has been seen as a defensive move against a resurgent Russia. After a 25-year absence, the navy will once again be commanded from beneath billions of tonnes of granite as the country strives to build up its defences in response to the perceived threat from Moscow.\n\nI should say.\n\n\u2022 This report in the New York Times was chilling, riveting, barbaric. Read it, if you can stand it:\n\nEvidence that the Paris police department missed warning signs about an employee who slashed four colleagues to death at its headquarters on Thursday is prompting demands for a leadership shake-up. At a news conference on Saturday, France\u2019s antiterrorism prosecutor, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ricard, said the killer, a 45-year-old computer technician who worked in police intelligence, had tried to justify to a colleague the killings in January 2015 at the magazine Charlie Hebdo and had done the same for other radical Islamist killings. The disturbing statements he made after a dozen people were killed in the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris were reported to higher-ranking officers, a police union official said Saturday, but nothing was done. The fact that this and other potential clues \u2014 including a video the killer posted on Facebook that imitated throat-cutting \u2014 were missed by the police administration that surrounded him, at the heart of an organization dedicated to fighting terrorism, has shocked the ranks of the national police.\n\nA true tale of our times \u2014 resembling other tales in other countries, including the United States (think of the Fort Hood massacre in 2009).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 At the White House, there was something dubbed the \u201cYoung Black Leadership Summit.\u201d The president said, \u201cAfrican Americans built this nation. You built this nation. You know, you\u2019re just starting to get real credit for that, okay? I don\u2019t know if you know that. You\u2019re just starting to get \u2014 you built the nation. We all built it. But you were such a massive part of it \u2014 bigger than you were given credit for. Does that make sense? Right?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForgetting the question of who built America, what do you think of the word \u201cyou\u201d? Did the people assembled in the East Room build America? Are people in the past, who had roughly your skin color, \u201cyou\u201d?\n\nThis is a big question in America, and not just in the White House.\n\n\u2022 From a New York Times report:\n\nWhen Ms. Nielsen tried to get him to focus on something other than the border, the president grew impatient. During a briefing on the need for new legal authority to take down drones, Mr. Trump cut her off midsentence. \u201cKirstjen, you didn\u2019t hear me the first time, honey,\u201d Mr. Trump said, according to two people familiar with the conversation. \u201cShoot \u2019em down. Sweetheart, just shoot \u2019em out of the sky, O.K.?\u201d\n\n(Full article here.)\n\nEliana Johnson, formerly of National Review, then of Politico, now the editor-in-chief of The Washington Free Beacon, tweeted, \u201cNot the only female cabinet secretary called \u2018honey\u2019 and \u2018sweetheart,\u2019 either.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI do not stand in judgment of Kirstjen Nielsen, the former secretary of homeland security. We all make choices, for various reasons \u2014 personal, professional, and so on. Perhaps Ms. Nielsen had the interest of the nation in mind. But, assuming the report is true \u2014 and does it comport with the president you have known and loved? \u2014 I don\u2019t know why she didn\u2019t tell Trump to go to hell.\n\nOr, as Johnny Paycheck sang, \u201cTake this job and shove it.\u201d\n\n\u2022 For reasons I could explain, I overheard Charles Percy and William Webster, two old pros, talking in the early days of the Lewinsky scandal. Percy had been a longtime U.S. senator; Webster had been director of the FBI, director of the CIA, etc.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s gotta go,\u201d one said to the other \u2014 the \u201che\u201d being President Clinton. The other said, \u201cYup.\u201d And yet, Clinton brazened it out. Almost certainly, Trump will do the same.\n\nShamelessness can enable truly extraordinary things.\n\n\u2022 This headline should give us pause: \u201cAs Steelmaker Shuts Plant, Governor Points to Tariffs.\u201d The article is from Bloomberg and it begins, \u201cBayou Steel Group filed for bankruptcy Monday, threatening hundreds of jobs after the company ran low on cash and defaulted on its debt.\u201d It continues,\n\nBayou Steel is \u201cparticularly vulnerable\u201d to tariffs because it uses imported scrap metal, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said in a statement following the layoffs. Scrap steel was not included in the broad steel tariffs imposed by the Trump administration last year. But the administration has hiked tariffs on a wide range of scrap metal products from China as part of its trade war.\n\nAmerican steel companies are supposed to be a big beneficiary of protectionism, right? Yet the world is interconnected \u2014 as protectionists tend to forget. The leg bone\u2019s connected to the knee bone; the knee bone\u2019s connected to the thigh bone . . .\n\nYou know the song \u2014 and economics, I\u2019m sure.\n\n\u2022 Several items above, I linked to an unbearable article. Here is another one:\n\nA five-year-old student began wetting himself in class after he was subjected to antisemitic bullying over the course of four months, while a 12-year-old student was forced to kiss the feet of a Muslim child and was physically assaulted. Both Jewish students, who have asked to remain anonymous, had to leave their public schools because their families felt the principals did not provide them adequate support.\n\n(Complete article here.)\n\nWhat is the alternative to eternal vigilance? None, that I can think of.\n\n\u2022 Not long ago, I mentioned Diet Eman, who died last month. Her obit in the New York Times began,\n\nFor 50 years after her fianc\u00e9 was seized by the Gestapo and she became a fugitive, Diet Eman remained largely silent about her role in the Dutch Resistance during World War II. After the war she abandoned Europe for the Americas to escape the memories of friends and families lost, of unspeakable barbarism, of spineless collaboration, of the moments her religious faith was tested to its very limit. \u201cI wanted to forget,\u201d she said \u2014 \u201cto start a new life in a country where there were no memories and never talk about that time again.\u201d\n\nEventually, however, she divulged her memories. \u201cWhat a woman,\u201d I remarked.\n\n\u201c\u2018What a woman!\u2019 is absolutely right!\u201d a reader e-mails me.\n\nAfter reading her account of those years of hiding Jews in Holland (Things We Couldn\u2019t Say), I wrote to her, especially wondering how she ever found the courage to do what she did. Unfortunately, I have lost her return letter, but she basically said God enticed her into her acts of courage; one small step led to another slightly more risky step, which led to another. In other words, God snookered her in!\n\n\u2022 I have written a reminiscence of Jessye Norman, the great soprano, who passed away last week. Just a little note, and personal. To read it, go here.\n\n\u2022 If you care for a music podcast, the latest episode of my Music for a While is here.\n\n\u2022 A Hollywood item? I don\u2019t do those very often. This one is linked to the world news, and it concerns Tom Cruise \u2014 who gave a wonderful answer. An answer I assume is a stock answer, given by him hundreds and hundreds of times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCruise was meeting the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky. When the actor walked into the room, the president exclaimed, \u201cYou\u2019re good-looking!\u201d Cruise laughed and said, \u201cIt pays the bills.\u201d\n\n(For a news story, go here.)\n\n\u2022 Speaking of funniness \u2014 this past weekend, Saturday Night Live touched a racial nerve. Check \u2019em out.\n\n\u2022 I like names, as regular readers know \u2014 and that includes spellings of names. I saw something new \u2014 new to me \u2014 in the Milwaukee airport yesterday. A young man who worked at an eatery wore a name tag that said, \u201cZackery.\u201d\n\nWhy not?\n\nThanks for joining me, Impromptus-ites, and good to see you.
