Warren confronts tough politics of health care", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For Elizabeth Warren, it was supposed to be another big idea in a campaign built around them: a promise that everyone could get government-funded health care, following the lead of her friend and fellow White House hopeful Bernie Sanders. Instead, \u201cMedicare for All\u201d is posing one of the biggest challenges to the Massachusetts senator\u2019s candidacy.\n\nPersistent questions about whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for universal health coverage have dominated her campaign in recent weeks. Warren has refused to answer, arguing that it\u2019s more important to note that overall costs would fall for nearly everyone but large corporations and the wealthy.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t quelled the criticism and, recognizing the push for specifics isn\u2019t going away, Warren is promising to soon unveil details about how she would cover the costs of what would be a massive new federal entitlement. The release will test Warren\u2019s ability to navigate the Democratic primary as she balances the demands of progressives who are open to new taxes against skepticism from moderates who say such levies would doom her in a general election.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s trying to thread the needle between the electorate that wants a simple answer and the facts that she knows and that she has to live with at some point down the road,\u201d said Jim McDermott, a former Democratic congressman from Washington state who spent most of his career trying to move a \u201csingle-payer\u201d plan.\n\nWith the first votes just over three months away, Warren could leave many disappointed.\n\nIf she aligns with Sanders, who acknowledges taxes will have to go up, she could further alarm Democrats worried she\u2019s pushing the party too far to the left. If she doesn\u2019t, that could alienate progressives who may accuse her plan of not going far enough. And any combination of the two might leave virtually everyone else still confused \u2014 wondering how to make the program\u2019s eye-popping math work.\n\nThat Warren is having to address health care questions on such starkly political terms may recall another, early campaign test she flunked: releasing the results of a DNA test last fall. Meant to quiet critics who questioned her past claims to Native American heritage, the move angered tribal leaders and energized critics like President Donald Trump who still gleefully deride Warren as \u201cPocahontas.\u201d\n\nWarren says that, far from having boxed herself in politically, she\u2019s been working on her health care plan for months and still sees it as a winning issue. Her campaign has consulted experts, is reviewing Sanders\u2019 funding options on universal coverage going back to his 2016 presidential run and says it will always stay true to Warren\u2019s promises that health care costs rise for the rich and big firms while falling for \u201chard-working families.\u201d\n\nOne expert Warren\u2019s team has consulted is Robert Pollin, a University of Massachusetts Amherst economist who supports Medicare for All and has called for partially helping to pay for it using a sales tax.\n\n\u201cWe should all pay something,\u201d said Pollin, who is a past donor to both Warren and Sanders but declined to discuss the specifics of his conversations with Warren\u2019s campaign. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get health care with no premiums, no deductibles, no fear of bankruptcy if you have a health emergency.\u201d\n\nWarren has refused to commit to the idea of everyone paying a little. But presenting the payment specifics she\u2019s promised means necessarily grappling with the possibility of higher overall costs for the program, since making health care free for the patient would encourage people to use more services.\n\nSara Collins, vice president for coverage and access with the nonpartisan Commonwealth Club, said the key involves changing how the health care tab is divided up among employers, government and individuals.\n\n\u201cThe overall growth in spending isn\u2019t that great, but it\u2019s the \u2018Who pays for it?\u2019 that really changes,\u201d said Collins, adding that costs would shift to the federal government, meaning \u201ctaxes will likely have to go up.\u201d\n\nMore pitfalls may emerge as the Warren campaign tries to estimate Medicare for All\u2019s cost. Since the final product would have to be approved by Congress, its contents are impossible to predict. A study released last week nonetheless estimated the government would need $2.7 trillion for Medicare for All to be fully implemented next year \u2014 more than half the current federal budget.\n\nSanders\u2019 campaign estimated that the universal health coverage plan he first introduced in 2016 would cost $14 trillion over the next decade. His estimates for the current race are far higher, though he now wants to offer more coverage.\n\nUnlike Warren, Sanders has already released payment options, including higher taxes on wealthy Americans and an employee payroll tax of 7.5%. But he\u2019s also suggested a 4% \u201cpremium\u201d on income that kicks in after the first $29,000 for a family of four \u2014 very much affecting the middle class.\n\nWarren could possibly avoid that by imposing co-pay rules or limiting what\u2019s covered. Her plan may institute payroll taxes to transfer what employers already spend on employee health care through private insurance to government-run Medicare for All. But that would give federal authorities more control over employee health costs than employers, potentially affecting jobs.\n\n\u201cIf your plan for health care involves the perception, even if it\u2019s not reality, that you\u2019re going to take away something that people have worked very hard to maintain \u2014 then it would be very problematic,\u201d said Brandon Dillon, former chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party.\n\nWarren\u2019s predicament is striking since she emerged as a front-runner alongside former Vice President Joe Biden by proudly \u201chaving a plan\u201d for everything but arguably the 2020 race\u2019s top issue. She\u2019s also spent months deftly floating above questions about paying for her other ambitious proposals, including offering universal child care and tuition-free education at public universities while canceling existing student debt, by proposing a wealth tax on the ultra-rich. That proposal effectively became a piggy bank to cover the costs of her other promises.\n\nThe wealth tax won\u2019t be enough to pay for Medicare for All, though. Warren\u2019s avoidance of the middle-class tax question has helped the issue linger as a political liability \u2014 and not just in Washington political circles.\n\nPeter Schweyer, a Democrat in Pennsylvania\u2019s House of Representatives who is undecided in the presidential race, called pointed questions of Warren over Medicare for All during last week\u2019s presidential debate \u201creally good.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll need to figure out how to respond,\u201d Schweyer said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers David Eggert in Lansing, Mich., and Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pa., contributed to this report.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For Elizabeth Warren, it was supposed to be another big idea in a campaign built around them: a promise that everyone could get", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
