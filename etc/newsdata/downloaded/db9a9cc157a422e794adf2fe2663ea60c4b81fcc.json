USA TODAY\n\nOklahoma's defense came up short in Saturday's shocking 48-41 loss at Kansas State, sending the Sooners reeling in the College Football Playoff race and calling into question whether the Big 12 will be represented in December's national semifinals.\n\nThe defeat ends one of the most impressive streaks in college football: Oklahoma hadn't lost a true road game since falling to TCU on Oct. 4, 2014. The 22-game winning streak was the longest in the Bowl Subdivision.\n\nThere was reason for optimism surrounding the Sooners' defense. New coordinator Alex Grinch had a profound impact during the team's unbeaten start, trimming the defense's per-play average by one full yard compared to a year ago \u2014 OU entered Saturday ranked 37th nationally in yards allowed per snap \u2014 and molding together a unit that seemingly meshed with an offense once again ranked among the nation's best.\n\nOklahoma coach Lincoln Riley looks on during the first quarter of his team's game against Kansas State. (Photo: Scott Sewell, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nStranger still, the defense entered Saturday playing its best football of the season: OU gave up just 242 yards across 64 plays in last week's 52-14 win against West Virginia, and had nine sacks in the rivalry win against Texas on Oct. 12.\n\nThen came Kansas State, with a ball-control offense that negated the Sooners' greatest asset \u2014 keeping Jalen Hurts and the offense on the sidelines \u2014 while taking advantage of two OU turnovers. In all, the Wildcats gained 428 yards on 72 plays, 215 coming on the ground across 44 carries, and possessed the ball for more than 37 minutes.\n\nSILVER LINING: The one good thing for Oklahoma in loss to Kansas State\n\nBEAT DOWN: Michigan used five-man sledgehammer to rout Notre Dame\n\nConversely, the Sooners ran only 53 plays and trailed 48-23 two minutes into the fourth quarter before a burst of scoring to draw within a touchdown. While Hurts threw for 395 yards and added another 96 on the ground, the rest of Oklahoma's running game combined for just six yards on seven carries.\n\nSo there's the blueprint for beating the Sooners: Don't let the Oklahoma offense operate. In this case, Kansas State operated the blueprint nearly to perfection while the Sooners' defense was unable to hold up its end of the bargain.\n\nFor the first time this season, one of the gold-standard postseason contenders has stumbled. It had been the status quo since August for teams such as the Sooners, Clemson, Alabama, LSU and Ohio State \u2014 but now the playoff race takes on a different feel heading into November.\n\nOne of the big winners, beyond the Wildcats themselves, might be Oregon. The current Pac-12 Conference favorite had been shipped to the outskirts of the playoff chase after losing in the opener to Auburn. In the weeks since, however, the Ducks have built a case for being included among the best teams in the FBS. Now Oregon finds a potential path for eventually joining the top four, at Oklahoma's expense.\n\nHere are the rest of Saturday's winners and losers:\n\nWinners\n\nKansas State\n\nIf everything ends up according to plan for the Wildcats' new coaching staff \u2014 and there are some major expectations surrounding first-year coach Chris Klieman, formerly of North Dakota State \u2014 Saturday's win will be seen as the turning point. Well, obviously. But Kansas State's style of play, with its more methodical offensive approach and dedicated running game, seems almost an outlier in a conference built around offensive ingenuity along with speed and tempo. After losing two in a row to open Big 12 play, the Wildcats are now 5-2 and a lock for a return to the postseason, with the likelihood of drawing some attention in this week's Amway Coaches Poll.\n\nOhio State\n\nThe Buckeyes continue to impress. Saturday's 38-7 win against Wisconsin was once a close game, believe it or not, with sloppy weather and the Badgers' defense keeping Ohio State off the scoreboard until a field goal more than midway through the second quarter, though the Buckeyes added a touchdown before halftime. Then OSU flexed: Wisconsin scored a touchdown to make it 10-7 a few minutes in the second half and the Buckeyes responded by scoring the game's final 28 points to cruise to 8-0 heading into an off week to open November.\n\nTOO GOOD: Big-time players have Ohio State looking like the No. 1 team\n\nChase Young\n\nA second Ohio State item, in brief: Chase Young is beginning to build some Heisman Trophy momentum from his spot at defensive end, with a particularly disruptive performance against the Badgers' solid offensive line. While it's almost impossible to picture a defender winning the Heisman, Young has at least proved himself more than worthy of being the first overall pick in next year's NFL draft.\n\nOhio State defensive lineman Chase Young sacks Wisconsin quarterback Jack Coan during the second quarter at Ohio Stadium.

Auburn led 13-10 with five minutes left in the third quarter until Joe Burrow and the LSU offense began to wear down Auburn's defense with two scoring drives. While freshman quarterback Bo Nix led Auburn to late touchdown to draw within 23-20, the Auburn offense struggled \u2014 Nix ended his day with 15 completions in 35 attempts for 157 yards and the Tigers gained just 287 yards overall \u2014 while LSU rallied around Burrow, who hit on 32 of his 42 throws for 321 yards and a touchdown. LSU will have a week off before the winner-take-all matchup with Alabama on Nov. 9.\n\nTOUGH WIN: No. 3 LSU gets past Auburn to set up Alabama showdown\n\nIndiana\n\nThe Hoosiers are now 6-2 under coach Tom Allen after a 38-31 win at Nebraska, which has gone from preseason favorites in the Big Ten West to a team that will have to scramble to reach the postseason. While the Hoosiers don't seem to be in the same class as the best teams in the East Division, Allen has Indiana back in bowl play for the first time since 2016 with a shot at nine wins. The program hasn't won nine games since 1967, when the Hoosiers last won a Big Ten championship and reached the Rose Bowl.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas is now 3-5 after an enjoyable 40-37 win again against Texas Tech. The ending was hard to imagine: Texas Tech blocked the Jayhawks' potential game-winning field goal with 13 seconds, only to fumble the blocked attempt back to Kansas, which took over the 15-yard line with two seconds left. The second attempt was good from 32 yards, so add this finish to the consistently updated highlight tape of Les Miles' wackiest moments. The two teams combined for 1,010 yards of offense.\n\nWILD FINISH: Massive gaffe by Texas Tech helps Kansas rare Big 12 win\n\nClemson\n\nClemson only scored one touchdown in the fourth quarter against Boston College. What's wrong with the Tigers? (Clemson led 52-7 after three quarters and finished with 674 yards of offense to the Eagles' 177.)\n\nCentral Florida\n\nUCF scored 63 points, averaged eight yards per carry, ran for 385 yards and gained 614 yards overall in taking a sledgehammer to Temple's normally solid defense, which has cratered across the past two weeks in losses to the Knights and SMU. UCF has been pushed off the New Year's Six picture since suffering its second loss but still has the look of a team worthy of the Top 25.\n\nLosers\n\nBig 12\n\nWhile on the topic of things that don't make sense, the Big 12 saw three perceived front-runners lose on Saturday. The first was Oklahoma. Later, Texas lost 37-27 at TCU after another impressive performance by the Horned Frogs' freshman quarterback, Max Duggan, who looks the part of a multiple-year starter. That gives the Longhorns two losses in three games, sandwiching last week's 50-48 win against Kansas, and three losses overall. Worse yet, Iowa State suffered its second conference loss after falling 34-27 at home to Oklahoma State. That leaves just one team, Baylor, without a Big 12 loss. (As everyone predicted back in August.)\n\nMichigan State\n\nSaturday saw the Spartans trail 21-0 at halftime in a listless, rain-soaked 28-7 loss to surging Penn State. To put this team's offensive ineptitude into perspective: Michigan State ended the month of October with 17 points. That's 17 points, added up, across three games; Stanford scored 24 points in the second quarter of Saturday's 41-31 win against Arizona. The Spartans' offense has become an annual embarrassment and Dantonio can no longer afford keep ducking questions about the continued nosedive on this side of the ball.\n\nACC Coastal\n\nPittsburgh entered Saturday's matchup with reeling Miami (Fla.) with a good chance at drawing even with Virginia atop the division \u2014 though the Cavaliers own the tiebreaker \u2014 and maybe squeezing into the final spot or two of the Amway Coaches Poll. But this is the Coastal, where nothing goes according to plan. After the Hurricanes' 16-12 win and the Cavaliers' 28-21 loss to Louisville, six of the seven Coastal teams are either 3-2, 2-2 or 2-3 in league play. (Georgia Tech is the exception at 1-3 in the ACC.) There's still a shot at every team in the Coastal minus the Yellow Jackets finishing tied atop the conference standings come the end of November.\n\nMissouri\n\nMissouri has lost to Vanderbilt and Kentucky in the past two weeks. Saturday's loss to the Wildcats may have the uglier of the pair, believe it or not. Missouri managed only 289 yards of offense in the 29-7 loss, which drops the Tigers to 5-3 heading into games against Georgia and Florida.\n\nNotre Dame\n\nMichigan's 45-14 win on Saturday night keeps the Wolverines in the thick of things for a New Year's Six bowl while giving Jim Harbaugh's team a reason to be positive amid a season thus far defined by losses to Wisconsin and Penn State. For Notre Dame, on the other hand, the loss means the Fighting Irish may end the regular season without one win against another team in the Top 25, since Virginia has already fallen out of the Coaches Poll. (Though Navy and Stanford might sneak into the Amway Coaches Poll by Nov. 16 or Nov. 30, respectively.)", "description": "There were highs and lows during Week 9 of the college football seasons.
