Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii). Just to be thorough, Clinton leveled the same allegation against 2016 Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein.\n\nWhat the heck? asked Carlson, who bashed all this loose chatter. All three people whom Clinton has accused of coziness \u2014 Gabbard, Stein and President Trump \u2014 are united by their work in opposing Clinton\u2019s political ambitions at one point or another, he said. Just getting warmed up, the host argued that the episode demonstrates Clinton\u2019s ordinariness and her \u201cweakness for bizarre conspiracies.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLater in the discussion, Carlson welcomed Democratic strategist Richard Goodstein to consider the situation. It\u2019s \u201cinexplicable,\u201d said Goodstein, that Gabbard interviewed with the Trump administration for a job and has shown a great facility for Russian talking points.\n\nThe principled Tucker Carlson was having none of that!\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is,\u201d said Carlson in his killer takedown, \u201cYou should \u2014 if you disagree with someone \u2014 address the substance of the argument that person\u2019s making and not accuse that person of betraying his or her country, which is what the Democrats are now doing and it\u2019s sort of the lowest thing I can imagine.\u201d\n\nRight, Tucker Carlson!\n\nAD\n\nIt is way lower, for example, than upbraiding progressive Democrats for their position on immigration enforcement by asking, \"Should people who hate the country be in charge of it?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt is way lower, for example, than hammering Democratic policies by saying, \u201cI think these policies are designed to destroy the country. I think they are being advocated by people who hate the country, and I think the aim is really clear. If you love the country, you would not propose this.\u201d\n\nIt is way lower, for example, than saying, \"The real threats we face today may be from within. Leaders who hate the country they govern so much that they seek to make American citizenship irrelevant.\u201d\n\nWho made those statements? The principled and righteous Tucker Carlson, who focuses on substance and sticks up for his fellow patriots!
