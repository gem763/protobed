I had an operation. I\u2019m a bionic woman and I have a titanium ankle. I was so truly stoned from all the drugs that I had to take to take the pain away. Really, it was mostly the anesthetics.\u201d\n\nThe film, which was directed by Martin Scorsese, is based on the story of Jordan Belfort, a wealthy stockbroker who faces a dramatic fall involving corruption and the federal government. It starred Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie and Matthew McConaughey, among others.\n\nJULIE ANDREWS SAYS THERAPY \u2018SAVED' HER LIFE AFTER HER FIRST MARRIAGE ENDED\n\nJULIE ANDREWS SAYS SHE AVOIDED SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN HOLLYWOOD BECAUSE MEN FEARED HER HUSBAND BLAKE EDWARDS\n\n\u201cI just wasn\u2019t ready and I wanted to be and I would\u2019ve loved to work with Scorsese,\u201d said Andrews.\n\nAccording to the outlet, the \u201cMary Poppins\u201d and \u201cSound of Music\u201d icon would\u2019ve played the role of Aunt Emma, who helps Belfort [DiCaprio] hide some money. That role eventually went to another Brit, \u201cAbsolutely Fabulous\u201d and \u201cPaddington 2\u201d actress Joanna Lumley.\n\nBut these days, Andrews is keeping busy. In fact, she\u2019s poised to star in the third movie of \u201cThe Princess Diaries,\u201d which also stars Anne Hathaway \u2014 whenever the script is completed.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard [there\u2019s a script finished],\u201d explained Andrews to a fan who asked if she had any updates since Hathaway\u2019s announcement of a completed script.\n\nJULIE ANDREWS SAYS SHE \u2018WENT INTO A DEPRESSION\u2019 AFTER LOSING HER SINGING VOICE DURING A 1997 OPERATION\n\nJULIE ANDREWS RECALLS FILMING HER FIRST LOVE SCENE: 'MY LEGS BUCKLED'\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been talk about [a third movie] for quite a while,\u201d Andrews continued. \u201cI think [Hathaway\u2019s] having a second child. She\u2019s busy and I\u2019ve been busy. If it happens, it would be lovely, and if it doesn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t have known about [it] so there you go.\u201d\n\nIn January of this year, Hathaway, 36, announced on an episode of \u201cLive\u201d that a script for the third film was already completed.\n\nThe next installment would follow the original 2001 film, as well as 2004\u2019s \u201cThe Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement.\u201d", "description": "Julie Andrews says she was unable to appear in 2013\u2019s \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d because she was too high on prescription drugs after surgery.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1181508232.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
