It was the day of her 31st birthday.\n\nHer husband, Scott Jenkins, told AM650 CKOM that she was excited to give birth to the couple\u2019s second daughter, Sydney\u2014the couple also have a four-year-old boy and 18-month-old girl\u2014and that everything was normal when they arrived at the hospital.\n\nDuring labour, however, Aly began to feel cold. Her condition deteriorated from there. Jenkins said that although doctors did everything they could to save her and she fought to stay alive, after five hours her heart gave out.\n\n\u201cShe was the rock, she loved everybody,\u201d Jenkins said, adding that it\u2019s unbearable to think of their kids not having memories of their mom. \u201cIt just drives me crazy. They\u2019re just so young, they won\u2019t remember her.\u201d\n\nBaby Sydney remains in critical care in the neonatal intensive care unit but is improving, according to Jenkins\u2019s Facebook page. A Go Fund Me campaign has been set up to help Jenkins and his family move forward.\n\nDoctors determined that amniotic fluid had entered Aly\u2019s blood stream, causing what\u2019s known as amniotic fluid embolism (AFE).\n\nALSO SEE: Canadian curler Aly Jenkins remembered as a \u2018fierce competitor\u2019\n\nThe condition is rare, occurring in approximately up to two of 100,000 pregnancies, according to a 2016 study published in the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.\n\nClinical signs include a rapid deterioration of maternal condition, cardiac arrest or arrhythmia, hypotension (abnormally low blood pressure), respiratory distress, coagulopathy (which is marked by bleeding with signs of shock and cold extremities) and massive hemorrhage.\n\nSome women have \u201cpremonitory\u201d symptoms such as tingling, shortness of breath, agitation, and a sense of \u201cimpending doom\u201d which might precede signs of cardiovascular collapse.\n\n\u201cThe cardiovascular system collapses,\u201d says Dr. Sarka Lisonkova, assistant professor and Michael Smith Scholar in Health Research in the department of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of British Columbia\u2019s Children\u2019s and Women\u2019s Health Centre in Vancouver. \u201cThere\u2019s a sudden collapse that needs really effective cardio pulmonary resuscitation. That\u2019s the first thing. If coagulopathy follows, there needs to be response to that\u2014either platelets or blood transfusion.\u201d\n\nThe cause of AFE isn\u2019t well understood, Lisonkova says. It seems that when amniotic fluid enters the maternal bloodstream, there can be an abnormal reaction that prevents the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs. The condition more closely resembles anaphylaxis or a systemic inflammatory response than a classic embolism, or blood clot, which is marked by shortness of breath and chest pain. It can also mimic myocardial infarction (heart attack), while other diagnoses, like septic shock, must be ruled out.\n\nALSO SEE: British teenager paralyzed after falling from his couch\n\nPrenatal risk factors included advanced maternal age, multiple pregnancies, gestational diabetes, and placenta previa. There are also risk factors associated with obstetric interventions, such as induction of labor, operative vaginal delivery, and caesarean delivery.\n\nThe condition is difficult to research because of its rarity, Lisonkova says. And yet while it\u2019s uncommon, AFE is one the leading causes of direct maternal death in industrialized countries - with respect to direct maternal deaths\n\nSome women who survive AFE have permanent neurological injury.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unpredictable,\u201d Lisonkova says. \u201cBut it\u2019s extremely rare. Women should not be worried about that with their pregnancies. Most of my colleagues would never see it in their career.\n\n\u201cThe way to address it is with multispacer team that\u2019s ready to respond to emergency in tertiary centres,\u201d she adds. \u201cThat\u2019s the way we have to increase the chances of survival.\u201d\n\nLet us know what you think by commenting below and tweeting @YahooStyleCA!
