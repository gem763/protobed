The city\u2019s new mayor, Gavin Newsom, had been in office for less than two months when, in defiance of California state law, he began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Nearly immediately, people from across the United States flocked to the city, waiting in lines that flowed around the block of the grand Beaux-Arts City Hall building, hoping they would get their chance at a license before, inevitably, Newsom\u2019s action was blocked. But for a few weeks, the weddings went on. In the same building where Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk were murdered by another city supervisor in an act of anti-gay violence two decades before, nearly 4,000 couples were illegally wed\u2014several of them, as those watching Friday\u2019s LGBTQ presidential forum in Iowa were told, by then\u2013District Attorney Kamala Harris.\n\nThe forum\u2014sponsored by GLAAD, One Iowa, local Iowa paper The Gazette, and the national magazine The Advocate\u2014gave the ten Democratic primary candidates who appeared a chance to voice their plans for ensuring LGBTQ rights. (Senator Bernie Sanders, former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, and entrepreneur Andrew Yang were absent.) For the most part, the agenda they each laid out was a shared one: Pass the Equality Act to guarantee federal anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people, end Trump\u2019s ban on trans people serving in the military, and outlaw conversion therapy. Many decried the recent transphobic comments made by Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, and some guaranteed they would get rid of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos (which, presumably, they would anyway as a new president building a new administration).\n\nJoe Biden made the most headlines with his condescension to moderator Lyz Lenz of The Gazette. When Lynz pressed him on his support for \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d in 1993 and the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, he responded that in 2012, as vice president, he had stated that he was \u201cabsolutely comfortable\u201d with same-sex marriage. For this, he wanted those at the forum to regard him as a leader on LGBTQ rights. But the more critical moment came when Lenz pushed Harris to explain why the trans community should trust her when, as attorney general in 2015, she denied gender confirmation surgery to a transgender women in a California prison.\n\nWhile several candidates pledged to protect trans women of color from violence\u2014Senator Elizabeth Warren went as far as to recite the names of 19 trans women of color who have been murdered this year\u2014the solutions offered to prospective voters focused on better equipping the police, whether with sensitivity training or access to federal funding, and putting more muscle behind the enforcement of hate crimes law. But the reality is police themselves can be an obstacle to that enforcement: 20 percent of anti-LGBTQ hate violence survivors report that when they sought help, law enforcement were hostile to them, and 55 percent say law enforcement were indifferent. Senator Cory Booker in part acknowledged this when he named police as a source of anti-LGBTQ violence. But no candidate addressed why police are given so much power over certain LGBTQ people, trans people in particular.", "description": "Some candidates seem to believe that their past support for marriage equality is enough to win the community's support.", "authors": ["Melissa Gira Grant"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/e8550250b37c591f7e91425ab6f3b97b0e05bf0a.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
