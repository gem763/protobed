REUTERS/Stringer\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s government has repeatedly said it wants to boost non-oil revenue since oil sales make up 90% of foreign-exchange receipts. Raising more money from taxes has proved difficult in a country where so many small businesses are not registered.\n\nFinance Minister Zainab Ahmed, addressing journalists late on Wednesday after a Cabinet meeting in which the proposal was approved, said the government proposed raising VAT next year to 7.2% - up from 5%. The current level is one of the lowest in the world.\n\n\u201cThis is important because the federal government only retains 15% of the VAT - 85% is actually for the states and local government,\u201d she said. \u201cThe states need additional revenue to be able to meet the obligations of the minimum wage.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s minimum wage was increased in April to 30,000 naira ($98) a month from 18,000.\n\nPrior to the minimum wage rise, the government had argued that many of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states struggled to pay salaries of state employees.\n\nThe planned VAT rise must be approved by parliament before it can become law.\n\nThe committee on finance in parliament\u2019s upper house, the Senate, will invite Ahmed and the chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Service to explain the reasons behind the plan, its chairman said late on Thursday.\n\nEarlier, the main opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) criticised the proposal.\n\n\u201cAn increase in VAT will worsen our decrepit economy and put more pressure on families and business as it will result in (an) increase in costs of goods and services,\u201d said the PDP in a statement.\n\nThe West African country fell into a recession in 2016 as a result of low oil prices. Despite emerging from the recession two years ago, economic growth remains low - at 1.94% in the second quarter.\n\nInflation has remained in double figures for the last three years, above the central bank\u2019s single-digit target, which has pushed up the cost of living in a country where most people live on less than $2 a day.\n\nThe proposed VAT hike is part of a broader drive to increase tax revenue.\n\nLast week Nigeria\u2019s tax chief told Reuters 5.32 trillion naira ($17.39 billion) was collected in taxes in 2018 and his office was targeting 8.9 trillion naira this year.\n\n($1 = 362.48 Nigerian naira)", "description": "Nigeria plans to increase value-added tax on goods, the finance minister said, as Africa's biggest oil exporter seeks to reduce its reliance on crude sales.", "authors": ["Felix Onuah", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429071823&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B13F-OZABS"}
