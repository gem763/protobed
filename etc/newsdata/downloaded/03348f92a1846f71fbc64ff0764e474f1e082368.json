REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgium has received a third arrest warrant request from Spain\u2019s Supreme Court for Catalonia\u2019s former pro-independence leader Carles Puigdemont, a spokeswoman for the Brussels prosecutor said on Wednesday.\n\nBelgium turned down the first two requests, made in 2017 and 2018. Puigdemont went into self-imposed exile in Belgium in autumn 2017 after Catalan separatist leaders organized a referendum that Spanish courts had ruled illegal and made a short-lived declaration of independence.\n\nSpain\u2019s Supreme Court filed its third extradition request days after convicting nine other Catalan leaders of sedition over the independence bid and sentencing them to jail terms ranging from 9-13 years.\n\n\u201cConsidering the complexity of the file and the two European arrest warrants previously sent against Mr. Puigdemont, the case will require a thorough judicial analysis,\u201d The Brussels prosecutor\u2019s spokeswoman said.\n\nIt may take weeks to reach a decision, she said, adding that the key issue for local authorities would be to decide if the convictions for sedition were legally recognized in Belgium.\n\nBelgian courts had used the same criterion in rejecting the first two Spanish requests.\n\nThe latest warrant was submitted in Spanish. The law requires that it be sent in one of Belgium\u2019s three national languages or English so Spain will send a new one next week, the spokeswoman said.", "description": "Belgium has received a third arrest warrant request from Spain's Supreme Court for Catalonia's former pro-independence leader Carles Puigdemont, a spokeswoman for the Brussels prosecutor said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441393138&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0IB", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
