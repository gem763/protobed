Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has revealed the ambitious next steps for his aerospace company at a highly-secretive media event in Washington, D.C. on Thursday. On stage, Bezos took the wraps off a massive model of what will be the firm\u2019s first lunar lander, dubbed Blue Moon\n\n'It's time to go back to the moon, this time to stay,' Bezos said during the event, according to CNN, mirroring a statement made repeatedly over the past few months by NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine.\n\nBlue Origin says its lunar lander will be able to carry all sorts of payloads to the surface and can hold \u2018multiple metric tons.\u2019\n\nThe craft will \u2019enable a sustained human presence on the moon,\u2019 the company said. And, according to the CEO, the company already has about six customers.\n\nThe lander builds upon technology the firm has been testing over the past few years in its New Shepard rocket, including propulsion and precision guidance, as well as the vertical landing system. The firm has quietly been developing Blue Moon for years.\n\nAccording to CNN, Blue Origin is also developing a new rocket engine specifically for its planned moon landings. The system, called BE-7, has been in the works for three years.\n\nBlue Origin says it could conduct the first test fire as soon as this summer.\n\nBezos also delved into his visions for human colonization of the moon and eventually, deep space, touching on the concept of self-sustaining \u2018O\u2019Neill colonies\u2019 exponentially larger than the International Space Station where humans and animals could live.\n\nBlue Origin says its lunar lander will be able to carry all sorts of payloads to the surface and can hold \u2018multiple metric tons.\u2019 According to the CEO, the lander has been in development for the last three years and is on track for a 2024 crewed moon landing \u2013 falling in line with the five-year deadline revealed earlier this year by Vice President Mike Pence\n\nJeff Bezos announces Blue Moon, a lunar landing vehicle for the Moon, during a Blue Origin event in Washington, DC, May 9, 2019\n\nEarth\u2019s resources alone won\u2019t be able to sustain humanity forever even with energy conservation, the mogul noted during the event, according to CNN.\n\nConsidering the possibility of a future that relies on strict rationing, Bezos suggests we must look toward space in order to continue thriving.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s the path that we would be on,' he said,\u2019 according to CNN.\n\n\u2018It would lead for the first time to where your children and grandchildren have worse lives than you. That's a bad path.\n\nThe event was first teased last month in a cryptic tweet from the Blue Origin Twitter account, where it shared an image of explorer Ernest Shackleton's Endurance, a polar exploration ship lost to the ice in in 1915.\n\nAdditionally, in a notice sent to the reporters, the company said it 'will give an update on [Blue Origin's] progress and share our vision of going to space to benefit Earth.'\n\nJeff Bezos, owner of Blue Origin, unveils a rocket engine that will be used on a new lunar landing module called Blue Moon\n\nDuring the event, which kicked off at 4 p.m on Thursday, the billionaire and Blue Origin founder started off by sharing elaborate concept images of self-sustaining space habitats reminiscent of the film Interstellar, with lush greenery and futuristic homes within its walls\n\nBezos also delved into his visions for human colonization of the moon and eventually, deep space, touching on the concept of self-sustaining \u2018O\u2019Neill colonies\u2019 exponentially larger than the International Space Station where humans and animals could live. The moon landing plan could ultimately serve as a stepping stone for colonization of the moon and deeper space targets\n\nWHAT IS THE BLUE MOON LANDER? Blue Origin unveiled its lunar lander during a secretive event in May Jeff Bezos has revealed his space exploration company's new lunar lander, dubbed Blue Moon. The spacecraft is capable of carrying and delivering payloads to the moon's surface. 'This is an incredible vehicle and it's going to the moon,' Bezos said. Blue Origin has long called out a mission to the moon as one of its foremost priorities and spent the past three years working to develop the craft. It harnesses many of the same 'propulsion, precision guidance, vertical landing and landing gear systems' utilized by New Shepard, Blue Origin's rocket meant to ferry humans to the moon. The craft is equipped with fuel cells to provide 'kilowatts of power' that are capable of lasting for long-distance missions. Once Blue Moon arrives at its destination, it uses machine learning algorithms to land with precision on the lunar surface. Blue Moon can deliver several metric tons of payload to the moon, thanks to its top deck and lower bays, the latter of which will allow for 'closer access to the lunar surface and off-loading,' the firm said. With this technology, Blue Origin hopes it will prepare us to be able to send humans back to the moon as soon as 2024. The spacecraft is capable of carrying and delivering payloads to the moon's surface. 'This is an incredible vehicle and it's going to the moon,' Bezos said\n\nBlue Origin also shared a copy of the 'Earthrise' photo taken by NASA astronauts during the Apollo 8 mission, in addition to the image of Endurance it tweeted out.\n\nSeveral Blue Origin fans were quick to point out that the image of Endurance may be an obscure reference to a future lunar mission. As it turns out, they were correct.\n\nA crater located on the south pole of the moon, called Shackleton, was named after the famed explorer, suggesting that Bezos may have some lunar-related announcements up his sleeve.\n\nThe Shackleton crater is located in the expansive South Pole-Aitken Basin, one of the largest known impact craters in the solar system, that spans 1,600 miles and is approximately eight miles deep.\n\nScientists have long had their eye on the Aitken Basin, as they believe it could hold a bounty of life-sustaining resources.\n\nNASA hopes to conduct a mission to the moon's south pole as soon as 2024, while China's Chang'e 6 lander aims to explore the lunar south pole.\n\nMany scientists are eyeing this area of the moon as they believe it could be host to huge sheets of ice that could be mined for drinking water or converted into hydrogen and oxygen for rocket fuel or oxygen to breathe.\n\nMany were quick to point out that Blue Moon is already used by the popular brewing company. Blue Moon Brewing Co quickly jumped into the conversation on Twitter\n\nThe craft will \u2019enable a sustained human presence on the moon,\u2019 the company said. And, according to the CEO, the company already has about six customers\n\nThe event was teased in a cryptic tweet from Blue Origin's Twitter account, where it shared an image of explorer Ernest Shackleton's Endurance, an exploration ship lost to the ice in in 1915\n\nNASA'S PLAN TO PUT HUMANS BACK ON THE MOON NASA could have humans back on the moon within the next five years under the latest orders from the Trump administration. Vice President Mike Pence revealed the new deadline during a speech at the fifth meeting of the National Space Council in Huntsville, Alabama today, where he told an audience that the president wants astronauts to touch down on the lunar south pole by 2024. The VP called on NASA to \u2018reignite the spark of urgency\u2019 for space exploration and make it a priority to set \u2018bold goals\u2019 and stay on schedule. This accelerated timeline, however will undoubtedly be met with many challenges; just weeks ago NASA said it was on schedule to have humans on the moon by 2028 \u2013 a full four years later than the new target.\n\nIn turn, it could help sustain future human colonies on the moon.\n\nBlue Origin has also discussed its plans to build and launch a lunar lander, revealing concept images of the spacecraft in 2018.\n\n'The future will be better for our children - and our children's children - if we use space to benefit life on Earth and enable millions of people to live and work in space,' the company said.\n\n'The next logical step in this path is a return to the Moon. To do this we need reusable access to the lunar surface and its resources.'\n\nAs part of the mission, referred to as Blue Moon, the company hopes to deliver cargo to the moon's surface, as well as scout for sources of water.\n\nBlue Origin is also part of The Moon Race, a non-profit that aims to establish a new competition, enlisting teams to develop ways to produce energy, grow food and establish infrastructure on the moon in exchange for cash prizes.\n\nThe Moon Race has also attracted support from Airbus and the European Space Agency.\n\nToday's announcement could eventually tie into an expected update on Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket.\n\nNew Glenn is the company's orbital rocket that it hopes to launch into space in 2021, though Blue Origin has released few details about the vehicle.\n\nIt's thought that the heavy-lift launch rocket could help Blue Origin complete a mission to the moon.\n\nBlue Origin's New Shepard rocket lands on May 2nd after its 11th successful test flight into space. The rocket has been eyed as a vehicle to deliver humans to the edge of space\n\nThe company has yet to conduct test flights of New Glenn and it has not been seen publicly.\n\nMeanwhile, a smaller rocket named New Shepard is envisioned to deliver humans to the edge of space later this year.\n\nBlue Origin conducted its 11th successful launch and landing of the New Shepard rocket earlier this month.\n\nThe company faces stiff competition from a range of players, including Elon Musk's SpaceX and Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic, which some have coined the 'billionaire space race.'", "description": "On stage, Bezos took the wraps off a massive model of what will be the firm\u2019s first lunar lander, dubbed Blue Moon.
