For one thing, it\u2019s adorably tiny and decently well-designed. (It looks exactly like a little iPhone X.) People take one look and want it to be good, or at least good enough to fulfill its promise.\n\nBut the real reason people don\u2019t want to believe me is that it promises to meet a real need that we all feel more every day: it\u2019s supposed to save you from your actual phone.\n\nThe Palm phone has been available for a few months to Verizon customers and on a few international carriers. The idea behind it is compelling: instead of carrying your attention-sucking phone around, you can carry this tiny thing. It shares your phone number, but it doesn\u2019t share all of the apps and social media angst you have on your main phone.\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to use it off and on since it was released, and I have mostly given up because the Palm phone is just kind of junky as a phone. It\u2019s more promise than product.\n\nOur review of Palm Verge Score 4 out of 10 Good Stuff It\u2019s small and cute Bad Stuff Terrible battery life\n\nOnly supports SMS sync\n\nIt really won\u2019t solve your digital overconsumption Buy for $349.99 from Verizon\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of the Palm phone before, here are the basics: it\u2019s an Android phone with a 3.3-inch screen that\u2019s so small you could almost fit it in the coin pocket of your jeans. It costs $350 and shares your phone number, acting as a second device on your line in the same way a connected smartwatch would. Verizon charges an extra $10 per month to keep it active, just like it does with connected smartwatches. (Also, it has literally nothing to do with the old Palm, Palm OS, or webOS.)\n\nProcessor is a weekly YouTube show that takes a deeper look at how consumer technology is changing and how we should think about our gadgets as people, not just as users. Subscribe here.\n\nBut the Palm phone isn\u2019t a smartwatch. It\u2019s a full Android phone. What you\u2019re supposed to do is use it when you don\u2019t want to be distracted by your main phone. You don\u2019t have to muck about with having a second phone number, and you don\u2019t have to give up having real apps if you need them. Where a traditional feature phone can\u2019t call you a Lyft, the Palm phone can. It theoretically eliminates some of the hassles of getting a second phone.\n\nI say it \u201ctheoretically\u201d eliminates those hassles because, as a practical matter, there\u2019s no way to eliminate all of them without a radical rethinking of how our phone networks operate in the first place. You might be able to receive phone calls, but text messages are a problem. Only SMS and MMS syncs, and only via Verizon\u2019s awful Message+ app. iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal, and even RCS Chat won\u2019t make it to your phone.\n\nRequiring $10 extra per month and not getting text messages are just the infrastructural problems that the Palm phone can\u2019t overcome. I don\u2019t think either is necessarily insurmountable, but even if Palm had managed to do so, the Palm phone would still be a loser on its own merits.\n\nIt\u2019s a bad phone, you see.\n\nHere are some of the problems with the Palm phone: the camera is terrible, the operating system doesn\u2019t have the latest Digital Wellbeing features that are ostensibly the whole point of getting this phone, the face unlock feature is likely insecure, there are no physical volume buttons, its custom software only occasionally helps with its tiny screen, it\u2019s preloaded with a fair bit of bloatware, it\u2019s terrifically slow, and (most of all) the battery life is downright atrocious.\n\nThe reply that a theoretical Palm apologist would give to all of those criticisms is that I\u2019m using traditional phone metrics to judge a thing that is not a traditional phone. I will admit that it could make sense to judge the Palm phone on different metrics than how we normally judge phones. The battery life is bad, yes, but you\u2019re not really supposed to have it on all the time anyway. It\u2019s slow, but really, you shouldn\u2019t be using it to do a ton of work. You should just look at it when you really need it. And so on.\n\nIf there\u2019s one bit of custom software that encapsulates this dichotomy, it\u2019s \u201cLife Mode,\u201d Palm\u2019s cloyingly named feature that\u2019s meant to minimize distractions. When Life Mode is on, the phone goes into an airplane mode when the screen is off. With the cellular and Wi-Fi radios turned off, you won\u2019t receive any notifications.\n\nPalm phone specs 3.3-inch, 445ppi screen\n\nSnapdragon 435 processor\n\n12-megapixel rear camera, 8-megapixel selfie camera\n\n3GB RAM and 32GB storage\n\nUSB-C port, no headphone jack\n\n800mAh battery\n\nAndroid 8.1\n\n50 x 97 x 7.4 mm, 62.5 grams\n\nThat\u2019s good and all, but I can\u2019t help but suspect the real point of Life Mode is to make up for how poor the battery life is. If you use the Palm phone like a regular phone, you\u2019ll be lucky to make it to noon. You\u2019re not supposed to do that, of course, and so it can theoretically last a day if you, you know, don\u2019t use it. But even with Life Mode on, it still drains on standby enough to kill it in a day \u2014 and that\u2019s with the radios off.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that Life Mode actually makes the experience of using the phone more distracting because all of those notifications come rolling in as soon as you turn it on. Sure, you will have fewer of them because you will have installed fewer apps on this phone than you would on your main phone. But now you\u2019ll have two phones that require you to tweak your notifications settings and two phones that will need charging every day.\n\nEven if you grant that the Palm phone was designed to be kind of bad to entice you to use it less, even minimal use will annoy you enough that you\u2019ll end up leaving it in a drawer and just taking your actual phone with you. You know the one: it\u2019s the thing with the really good camera and the big screen and \u2014 yes \u2014 all of your apps.\n\nIt\u2019s those apps that are the real problem, not your phone.\n\nWe have heard for the past couple of years that our phones are bad for us. We\u2019re staring at them instead of at each other, and even when they\u2019re in our pockets, they vibrate and distract us. We\u2019re only half here. Various movements have arisen to convince Apple and Google to do a better job of helping us use them more humanely.\n\nThe science on whether any of this qualifies as an actual \u201caddiction\u201d is inconclusive, as Rachel Becker explained last December. Nevertheless, I think it\u2019s more than safe to say that it\u2019s a problem for a lot of us.\n\nApple and Google have responded with features designed to help us have a better relationship with the apps on our phones. They\u2019ve finally made it easier to trim down on all the notifications we receive. There are also new features that let us set time limits on apps and even gray-out the screen so we\u2019re not tempted by all the pretty colors. For some, they help, but I suspect a lot of people are like me: when they hit the time limit, they just turn it off and keep scrolling.\n\nScreen Time features don\u2019t go far enough yet\n\nI\u2019d like to see more advanced software on our main phones. Software that makes me think twice before I open an app, not after I\u2019ve used it for an hour. Software that is better at understanding why I am using a given app for hours on end on some days and not at all on others. Software that lets me toggle between something like a \u201cFull Use Mode\u201d and a \u201cLite Mode\u201d that\u2019s stricter about what it lets me use.\n\nBut that software is likely a ways off, and setting it up would probably take so much upfront configuration that most people wouldn\u2019t bother with it. Anyway, the truth is that we should not meekly wait for these giant tech companies to protect us from ourselves. We should figure it out on our own. We\u2019ll have to anyway, given the incentives at play for app makers.\n\nMore than anything, the need to figure out this whole complicated situation is why the Palm phone is so compelling to people. It\u2019s why so many people want to believe that it could be good: because it offers a quick, no-fuss promise to fix all of this. Just plop down the $350, and all of your problems will go away.\n\nThe Palm phone is a fad diet for your digital consumption. Just like fad diets, it promises a quick and easy fix for a perniciously complicated problem. Just like fad diets, it offers a framework for understanding your digital health that\u2019s massively oversimplified at best and unhealthy at worst. And just like fad diets, the chances that it will actually help long-term are basically nil.", "description": "There\u2019s a tiny phone that is supposed to help you use your big phone less.
