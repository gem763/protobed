Banning political ads favors incumbents and whoever the media covers.\u201d\n\nAnd he also seemed to brazenly rewrite the site\u2019s beginnings, which were reportedly as a \u201chot or not\u201d game for Harvard students to play, as a platform to share perspectives after the beginning of the Iraq war.\n\n\u201cI remember feeling that if more people had a voice to share their experiences, then maybe it could have gone differently,\u201d he said. \u201cThose early years shaped my belief that giving everyone a voice empowers the powerless and pushes society to be better over time.\u201d\n\nThe CEO addressed Facebook\u2019s attempts to enter the Chinese market, saying the company was unable to overcome China\u2019s strict censorship. And he seemed to take a swipe at competitor platform TikTok, the Chinese video sharing app recently gaining huge popularity.\n\n\u201cI wanted our services in China because I believe in connecting the whole world, and I thought maybe we could help creating a more open society,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\n\u201cI worked hard on this for a long time, but we could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there,\u201d he said. \u201cThey never let us in.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg said the company now has 35,000 people working on platform security and that the company\u2019s security budget is larger than $5bn \u2013 greater than the entire company\u2019s revenue when it went public in 2013.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s address was met with swift, and fierce, criticism.\n\nNot-for-profit organizations pushed back against a number of Facebook policies highlighted on Thursday, including those around hate speech and voter suppression. When discussing discriminatory speech, Zuckerberg repeatedly stressed his commitment to \u201cfree expression\u201d and said he feared \u201cpotentially cracking down too much\u201d.\n\n\u201cMark Zuckerberg made clear today that he is not only doubling down on a business model that corrupts our democracy, but also fundamentally lacks an understanding of how civil rights, voter suppression, and racism actually function in this country,\u201d said Rashad Robinson, the president of digital anti-hate group Color Of Change.\n\n\u201cZuckerberg is co-opting civil rights history to justify Facebook policies that undermine our democracy,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, the president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. \u201cHard to imagine MLK and Frederick Douglass, who he just invoked, supporting FB\u2019s move to protect politicians who rely on misinformation and race-baiting for electoral gain.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s reference to Facebook as the fifth pillar of democracy drew criticism from journalists. The Facebook CEO represents \u201cthe antithesis of free expression\u201d, said John Stanton, the co-founder of the Save Journalism Project, in a statement.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s thrown pennies at programs to \u2018help\u2019 journalists that, in actuality, are little more than PR stunts intended to provide cover as he puts countless journalists out of work, strips the industry to the bone, and reaps billions in ad revenue,\u201d Stanton said.\n\nFacebook\u2019s policies on allowing misinformation in political advertising have been the subject of intense debate in recent weeks, following the platform\u2019s refusal to take down a Donald Trump campaign ad that made misleading statements about the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\nFacebook has increasingly come under scrutiny as the 2020 elections near, with a number of candidates calling for the breakup of the social media giant.\n\nIn an effort to highlight the consequences of the policy, the Democratic senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren published her own misleading advertisement on the social media network.\n\nMany of these issues may be addressed when Zuckerberg testifies next week at a congressional hearing over Libra, Facebook\u2019s new cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cLook, we know we\u2019re doing a very good job of making everyone angry,\u201d Zuckerberg said.", "description": "CEO faces quick backlash over highlighted policies, including on hate speech and voter suppression", "authors": ["Kari Paul"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/056fb1ed7c2b627dfa4eed07998d8742d6093113/0_252_3992_2396/master/3992.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=586d076afe55ee61e41448675e4fb1aa", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
