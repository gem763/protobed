Watching without access to polling data, you might have imagined that this was some sort of wild careening mess of a primary race, when really it\u2019s remarkably consolidated.\n\nThere is a Joe Biden constituency that seems stable at around 30 percent of the primary electorate. There is an Elizabeth Warren constituency that has expanded swiftly enough, especially in early states, to make her arguably the front-runner. There is a Bernie Sanders constituency that is about two-thirds the size of Warren\u2019s and Biden\u2019s peak and seemingly stuck there. And then, way down at around 5 percent and under, there is everybody else.\n\nSo a big question in this debate and in the ones before Iowa arrives and the also-rans begin to be formally run out is whether Democratic voters can be persuaded to reconsider this consolidation. And last night there were only really two candidates who presented themselves as plausible vehicles for that reconsideration: Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar.\n\nAs for the others \u2014 well, Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard are too niche, Beto O\u2019Rourke is too limp, Juli\u00e1n Castro is too forgettable and Tom Steyer is too absurd. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker should be contenders, but Booker manages to be appealing at every debate without quite finding a rationale for his candidacy, while Harris has been on a weird self-destruct mission ever since her brief ascent \u2014 with her strange fight with Warren last night over whether Twitter should ban Donald Trump a particularly peculiar self-charted nose-dive.", "description": "Can Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar fight back against the primary field\u2019s consolidation?", "authors": ["Ross Douthat"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/opinion/16oped1/merlin_162774417_85db668d-5fb5-4450-851b-10d89d55a741-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
