But it turns out the couple was waiting for the perfect moment to share the news of their newborn with the world.\n\nReynolds put an end to the speculation on Wednesday by posting a photo of himself, Lively and the youngest of their three kids sharing a sweet moment in a forest in British Columbia, Canada, where he grew up.\n\nBut in a peak Ryan Reynolds move, the photo shows his new daughter obscured by a hand-drawn pink smiley face, essentially trolling fans who thought we might get a peek at the baby. Reynolds and Lively, of course, are notoriously private, so it\u2019s not unusual that they\u2019d want to keep the newborn out of the public eye.\n\nI love B.C. \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 I want my daughters to experience the same natural playground I grew up in.

I want my daughters to experience the same natural playground I grew up in,\u201d he wrote, seemingly confirming that the couple had welcomed a daughter.\n\nThe Vancouver-born actor continued: \u201cOn Oct. 21, the candidate you vote for will SHAPE CLIMATE POLICY.

Writing on the website, she opened up about the \u201coverwhelming\u201d pressures of being a new mom.\n\n\u201cI understand how overwhelming it is to be a new parent,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t tell you is it never gets less overwhelming, but with each kid I do learn more.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cBefore I had my first, I was lucky to have the parents in my life who I trusted to share their \u2018must haves\u2019 with me. I hope to do the same for you with my baby registry picks. Good luck!
