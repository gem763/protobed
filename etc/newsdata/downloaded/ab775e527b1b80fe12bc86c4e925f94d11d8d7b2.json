Chapman and Laureano each went deep twice. \u2026 A\u2019s managed just one run in 13 1/3 innings against Morton. He pitched seven scoreless at home June 10 and went 6 1/3 innings June 20 in Oakland. \u2026 Fiers went 1-0 with 2.25 ERA in two starts vs. Tampa Bay. He was 9-0 with 2.90 ERA at home. \u2026 Manaea missed most of season recovering from shoulder surgery but has been outstanding since returning in September. \u2026 Oakland was one of three teams Rays had losing record against during season. The other two - Yankees (7-12) and Twins (2-5) - also made playoffs. \u2026 Tampa Bay\u2019s 32-60 record at Oakland Coliseum is second-worst at any road venue where Rays have played minimum of 10 games.\n\n___\n\nBig Picture:\n\nRays: A year after finishing with more wins (90) than any other team that didn\u2019t make postseason, Rays (96-66) are in playoffs for fifth time in franchise history - first since 2013, when they won Game 163 tiebreaker to claim second AL wild card. \u2026 Fifth-year skipper Kevin Cash will be managing his first postseason game. \u2026 Rays made playoffs four times in six-season span from 2008-13 under Joe Maddon, including run to 2008 World Series. \u2026 Since start of 2008, when the Devil Rays changed team colors and rebranded themselves as the Rays, Tampa Bay has won 90 or more games seven times. The Dodgers (8), Yankees (7) and Red Sox (7) are the only other teams to do it that often. \u2026 Won only previous wild-card game 4-0 at Cleveland in 2013. Kiermaier is only player still on team from that game. Bullpen coach Stan Boroski is lone coach remaining. \u2026 Club with baseball\u2019s lowest payroll ($66.4 million) believes it has good shot to make noise in October because pitching staff has been bolstered lately by return of Snell, the 2018 AL Cy Young Award winner, along with Glasnow and Chirinos. \u2026 Meadows was one of hottest hitters in the majors during September. \u2026 Lowe is back from stint on 60-day injured list, and Choi seems to have knack for producing in key situations. \u2026 Rays have 10 players on active roster with previous postseason experience. \u2026 Tampa Bay put 24 players on injured list this year. Morton, Adames and Pham are only ones who spent entire season on active roster. \u2026 Rays won franchise-record 48 road games this year, including two in Oakland.\n\nAthletics: Oakland (97-65) made playoffs as a wild card for second straight season and tied last year\u2019s team for club\u2019s most wins since 2002. \u2026 A\u2019s were 37-36 on June 16 but have gone 60-29 since for best record in majors. \u2026 Oakland is making 10th postseason appearance this century but has advanced past Division Series just once, in 2006. Team is 1-14 during that span with a chance to move on, including losses in wild-card game to Kansas City in 2014 and Yankees last season. \u2026 A\u2019s set franchise record with 257 homers and are one of 11 teams all-time to have at least seven players with 20 or more HRs. \u2026 Oakland went 35-14 in games started by lefties compared to 62-51 vs. right-handers. \u2026 A\u2019s finished 52-29 at home for seventh-best record at Coliseum since moving to Oakland. \u2026 A\u2019s starters are 17-4 with 3.89 ERA in past 37 games and have 68 wins on the season, second-most in majors behind Houston. \u2026 Davis finished on high note after struggling much of the season. He had 4 homers and 13 RBIs in his last 18 games after posting just 3 HRs and 22 RBIs over previous 57. Davis is third in majors with 156 HRs the past four years. \u2026 Semien matched Oakland record for runs (123), tied for third-most total bases (343) and broke Rickey Henderson\u2019s franchise record with 31 homers from leadoff spot. He also is one of the top defensive shortstops in majors.\n\n___\n\nWatch For:\n\n- Fresh Faces. Tampa Bay\u2019s opening day roster included 17 players with two or fewer years of major league experience, including eight of nine relievers. Meadows and Lowe became first-time All-Stars. Others such as Glasnow, Chirinos, Adames, Yarbrough and Poche are eager to make names for themselves, too, on the postseason stage.\n\n- Shaky Bullpen. The A\u2019s rode their relievers to the playoffs last year but haven\u2019t had nearly as much success out of the \u2018pen in 2019. Oakland had a major league-worst 30 blown saves, setting a record for the most by a 90-win team. Hendriks enjoyed a strong season after taking over as closer, with his 122 Ks as a reliever setting an A\u2019s record, but the setup situation was spotty. Oakland is hoping Puk and Luzardo, the organization\u2019s top prospects as starters, can provide a boost as late-season call-ups in the bullpen.\n\n- Bargain Catch. One of the best moves the cost-conscious Rays made all season was purchasing d\u2019Arnaud from the Dodgers for $100,000 on May 10. After beginning the season in a 2-for-24 slump with the Mets and Dodgers, he\u2019s been one of Tampa Bay\u2019s most consistent players. In addition to having the second-most RBIs on the team since late May, he\u2019s been solid defensively at catcher and also done a nice job at first base.\n\n- Home Heartache. The A\u2019s are playing their first home playoff game since 2013, when they were shut out by Justin Verlander and the Tigers in a decisive ALDS Game 5. Verlander also blanked the Athletics in Game 5 of a Division Series the previous year. Oakland is 0-5 in winner-take-all playoff games at home since 2000.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A look at the American League wild-card game between the Tampa Bay Rays and Oakland Athletics:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/rays_blue_jays_baseball_47820_c0-284-3000-2033_s1770x1032.jpg?179ea09338ddd63d360bb6e02aa6ab97ea6cd69b", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
