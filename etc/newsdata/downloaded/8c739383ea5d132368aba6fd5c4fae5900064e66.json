Those troops are supported by Turkish Army artillery and mortar fire, and Turkish Air Force strikes.\n\nAmerican officials say these Turkish-backed militia are less disciplined than regular Turkish soldiers, and deliberately or inadvertently have fired on retreating American troops.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com World Middleeast Turkey-Syria-Kurds-Troops.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
