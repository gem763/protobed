The writer-director apparently pulls no punches doing so.\n\nIn the trailer, Jojo confronts the fanaticism of far too many of his countrymen when he learns his mother, played by Johansson, is hiding a young Jewish girl in their home.\n\nIt seems as if through getting to know the girl, he starts to learn that Jewish people are just people and doesn't understand the dictator's hatred of them.\n\nThe film, featuring performances by Rebel Wilson, Stephen Merchant and Oscar winner Sam Rockwell, will premiere at the Toronto Film Festival before coming to theaters Oct. 18.\n\nNext up for Waititi will be a sequel to his blockbuster movie, \"Thor: Ragnarok,\" titled \"Thor: Love and Thunder,\" which opens in 2021.", "description": "New Zealand-born director Taika Waititi has released the full trailer for his", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/jojo-rabbit-movie-ht-ml-190904_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
