Once confirmed, any changes to operation hours will be automatically updated and reflected on Google Maps and Search.\n\n\"This not only helps people save time during busy holidays, but also ensures that businesses maximise foot traffic at their stores,\" Google Engineering VP Scott Huffman wrote in a blog post.\n\n\n\nHe added that if businesses want to opt-out of receiving calls from Google, the company will honour it.\n\n\n\n\"We're also mindful of including controls for businesses,\" he said.\n\nSee also: Google Duplex: What should businesses expect? (TechRepublic)\n\n\n\nBusinesses are also able to continue to update their hours by calling Google or via settings in Google My Business.\n\nThe features of Google Duplex was extended at this year's Google I/O to allow the virtual assistant to go through time-consuming tasks like filling out forms online to book a car reservation.\n\n\"We want to make this experience better for both users and businesses,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said, during his keynote at the event where he demonstrated the car reservation use case.\n\nWhen a user asks Google Assistant to book a car, Duplex will pull up the reservation page and automatically start filling out the user's personal information. It navigates through the site and taps into tools like Gmail and Calendar for relevant information like travel dates.\n\n\"It's acting on your behalf and helping you save time, but you're always in control,\" Pichai said.\n\nWhen the AI tech was launched at last year's Google I/O, it only allowed users to book restaurant reservations over the phone.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nGoogle expands its Duplex AI technology to more devices\n\nThe voice assistant that helps you book restaurant reservations over the phone should be available on iPhones and more Android devices\n\nGoogle I/O: From 'AI first' to AI working for everyone\n\nTwo years after adopting its \"AI first\" strategy, CEO Sundar Pichai showcased how Google is applying AI across its platforms to make a \"more helpful\" Google.\n\nIn Google we trust: But why?\n\nIn contrast to Facebook, which has seen its trustworthiness plummet, Google has won trust by delivering sherpa-like navigation through digital and physical domains. That's going to pay huge dividends in an AI-driven world.\n\nGoogle brings Assistant's \"continued conversation\" feature to smart displays\n\nThe feature lets users engage in a conversation with the voice-activated assistant without prefacing each statement with \"Hey Google.\"", "description": "Businesses in the pilot group will receive automated calls from Google ahead of New Zealand's Labour Day public holiday.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/07/b1a73f57-34fd-434e-98a6-524fd812bd6b/thumbnail/770x578/6a4156fe2b80f304376b8d08982da837/screen-shot-2019-05-07-at-2-44-17-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
