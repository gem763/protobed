QRVO is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2020 results on Oct 1. Notably, the company\u2019s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 12.6%.\n\nQ1 Performance\n\nIn fiscal first quarter, Qorvo delivered non-GAAP earnings of $1.36 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.15 and rallied 41.7% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure.\n\nRevenues on a non-GAAP basis increased 11.9% year over year to $775.6 million.

Price and EPS Surprise\n\nQorvo, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise More\n\nQorvo, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Qorvo, Inc. Quote\n\nWhat to Expect in Q2\n\nFor fiscal second quarter, Qorvo anticipates revenues between $745 million and 765 million. Earnings are projected to be $1.30 per share at mid-point. Management anticipates quarterly revenues to be impacted by seasonal ramps from the top customer, which will be offset by lower sales to Huawei.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.30 per share, unchanged for the past 30 days. The figure indicates a decline of 25.7% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $754.4 million, which suggests a decline of 14.7% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the factors that are likely to get reflected on the upcoming quarterly results.\n\nFactors at Play\n\nSolid demand for Qorvo\u2019s performance-tier for RF Fusion based solutions is likely to have driven its top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, the quarterly results are expected to show benefits from antenna tuning, discrete components and Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) based multiplexers.\n\nMoreover, robust growth in the company\u2019s wireless connectivity, improvement in base station solutions and robust 5G infrastructure market demand might have made a positive impact on the company\u2019s performance in fiscal second quarter.\n\nFurther, strong demand for the company\u2019s solutions in defense (advanced radars and other electronic warfare products) and connectivity (Wi-Fi and emerging IoT applications) is another positive. Rapid adoption of GaN for high-power applications, radars and other electronic warfare products are expected to have contributed to the to-be-reported quarter\u2019s revenues.\n\nRecently, the company expanded GaN shipments into S-band (2-4 GHz) and C-band (4-8 GHz) applications for defense radar programs. Further, the company was chosen to supply GaN amplifiers for low Earth orbit satellites by Syrlinks to aid OneWeb space-based internet connectivity globally.\n\nQorvo was also selected by Samsung to offer antenna tuning, high-band PAD and Wi-Fi iFEM for mass market Galaxy A series.\n\nFurther, the company increased shipments of 5G massive MIMO infrastructure solutions to various OEMs. It also secured new design wins across all sub-6 GHz 5G frequency bands.\n\nNotably, Qorvo sampled BAW-based 5G antennaplexer solutions to enable customers in utilizing antenna architectures for 5G devices.\n\nAccelerated deployment of 5G bodes well for Qorvo. The company has participated in many 5G field trials and demonstrations.\n\nIn the quarter under review, Qorvo acquired Active-Semi International, Inc to strengthen its portfolio of programmable analog and mixed signal power offerings.\n\nIn fact, the company anticipates the buyout to bolster its addressable markets by approximately $3 billion. Post the acquisition, financials of Active-Semi will be reported under Qorvo\u2019s Infrastructure and Defense Products (IDP) operating segment.\n\nIDP revenues grew double digit year over year to $219 million, which marked the 13th consecutive quarter of growth.\n\nFurther, Mobile Products revenues in the second quarter are expected increase sequentially.\n\nHowever, customer concentration, particularly from Apple AAPL and Huawei, is a significant headwind. Further, management expects IDP revenues to decline year over year and sequentially, primarily due to restriction from supplying products to Huawei and its affiliates.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Qorvo's (QRVO) Q2 results are likely to reflect benefits from robust growth in wireless connectivity and base station solutions as well as expanding portfolio of 5G and GaN solutions.", "authors": ["Zacks Equity Research"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/45jeGiBma7S_3fB1R.4xBA--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MzU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/4f433153f8078d93a99e518e55cf12ce", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
