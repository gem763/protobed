The number of staff paid over \u00a3150,000 rose by a similar proportion over the same period, from 867 to 976.\n\nKieran Neild of the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, said their findings shine a light on the \u201cthousands of university administrators taking home very plush pay packets\u201d.\n\nHe said: \"Taxpayers and students will be left with a degree of uncertainty over whether this is money is being well spent, particularly when left-wing professors are so keen to lecture them about the evils of inequality.\n\n\"Instead of constantly complaining about faculty budget cuts, university bosses need to get their bumper wage bills under control and focus on providing their students with the very best higher education they can.\"\n\nBritish universities employed 429,560 people last year, according to data from the Higher Education Statistical Agency, up 2.3 per cent from the year before.\n\nDavid Palfreyman, director of the Oxford Centre for Higher Education Policy Studies, said that vice-Chancellors now surround themselves with a \u201ccadre\u201d of highly paid managerial staff. \u201cCompared with 25-30 years ago, there are now far more managers at universities,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Palfreyman, who is the Bursar at New College, Oxford, added that there is \u201csome justification\u201d to accusation that the higher education sector has got \u201ccarried away\u201d with \u201cadministrative bloat\u201d.\n\nVice-Chancellors have come under fire for their vast paypackets. Earlier this year it emerged that the average pay for university chiefs rose above \u00a3250,000 for the first time as more than 100 institutions offered pay rises in the last year despite heavy criticism of the salaries.\n\nAccording to the Office for Students, the average basic salary for a university vice chancellor rose ahead of inflation, from \u00a3245,000 a year to \u00a3253,000 a year, with five heads earning more than \u00a3500,000 with benefits and severance payments included.\n\nThe universities watchdog has warned that university chiefs must be prepared to answer \u201ctough questions\u201d and be able to justify their salaries where necessary.\n\nThere has been increased scrutiny on large salaries of university chiefs, especially after student fees rose to \u00a39,250 per year at many institutions.\n\nMinisters have called on universities, which are autonomous and set their own salaries, to show more restraint rather than \u201cratcheting up\u201d salaries at a higher rate than inflation.\n\nA spokesman for Universities UK said: \u201cIt is important for universities to demonstrate that the process for determining pay for senior university staff is rigorous and that decisions are fair, explained and justified.\n\n\u201cWe support the Committee of University Chairs\u2019 Remuneration Code and its principles to create a more transparent system for determining senior staff pay.\u201d", "description": "More than 4,000 university staff are paid more than \u00a3100,000 a year, a new rich list has revealed.", "authors": ["Camilla Turner", "Education Editor", "Janet Daley", "Juliet Samuel", "Michael Deacon", "Sarah Champion"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/education/2017/01/11/117582340money-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWSm3Hskyb1S8n9mpYgoiGz7qDM1k-FXUpc9UWB6g6Ho.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
