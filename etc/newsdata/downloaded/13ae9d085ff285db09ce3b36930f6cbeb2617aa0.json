You can see what this might have looked like in the video below.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoss Bland-Hawthorn, director of the Sydney Institute for Astronomy, University of Sydney, was part of the team which this week revealed that the \u2018supermassive black hole at the heart of our galaxy spat out an enormous flare of radiation 3.5 million years ago that would have been clearly visible from Earth\u2019.\n\n\u2018The discovery changes our view of our galaxy\u2019s central black hole, which has appeared dormant throughout recorded human history,\u2019 he went on to write in an article for The Conversation.\n\n\u2018Astronomers are coming to realise that it has been hugely active, even explosive, in the relatively recent past in galactic terms (measured in millions of years).\n\n\u2018This activity has been flickering on and off for billions of years. We don\u2019t understand why this activity is intermittent, but it has something to do with how material gets dumped onto the black hole. It might be like water droplets on a hot plate that sputter and explode chaotically, depending on their size.\n\n\u2018Our situation on Earth resembles living near a largely dormant volcano like Mount Vesuvius that is known to have been explosively active in the past, with disastrous consequences for Pompeii.\u2019\n\nThis astonishing cosmic fireworks display would have been visible from Earth.\n\n\u2018Some three million years ago, our direct ancestor Australopithecus afarensis walked the Earth,\u2019 Bland-Hawthorn continued.\n\n\u2018They may well have looked up towards Sagittarius and seen cones of light shooting sideways from the Milky Way, brighter than any star in the night sky.\n\n\u2018The lightshow would have appeared as static beams on a human timescale, only flickering on timescales of thousands of years. Today, the only visible remnant of that immensely powerful event is the cooling gas along the distant Magellanic Stream.\u2019\n\nThis graphic shows a black hole surrounded by its accertion disc (Image: Nasa)\n\nHe went on to say that it\u2019s possible a similar spurt of radiation is coming our way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018If the beam was pointing at the Solar System, the jet would have to plough through the Milky Way disc, and it would take about ten million years to reach us,\u2019 he added.\n\n\u2018So it\u2019s possible that a more ancient explosion could have produced a powerful jet that is yet to reach us.\u2019\n\nBlack holes are sometimes surrounded by an \u2018accretion disc\u2019 made up of superhot gas and other material.\n\nIt\u2019s this disc which sends \u2018jets, winds and radiating beams of light\u2019 through the galaxy as it interacts with the black hole.\n\nIf a human was hit by a black hole beam, they would almost certainly die.\n\nBut we\u2019re happy to report that even if Sagittarius A* has sent a dangerous ray towards Earth, humanity would more or less definitely survive the blast.\n\nThe astronomer wrote: \u2018We need not worry \u2013 at its peak, the intensity of the jet when it reaches us is unlikely to exceed the most energetic solar flares.\n\n\u2018These are known to knock out satellites, and pose a threat to space-walking astronauts, but our own atmosphere largely protects us on Earth.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018There\u2019s no need to be alarmed: as far as we can tell, we are safe here in orbit about a cool dwarf star far from the centre of the Milky Way.\u2019", "description": "Monster at our galaxy's core is known to send gigantic gusts of radiation scorching hundreds of thousands of light-years through space.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_88635791_1570543863.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
