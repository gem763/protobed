Tigres went on to win 3-1.\n\nDespite the win, Veracruz remained bottom of the standings with seven points from 15 games.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Troubled Mexican side Veracruz have finally won a league match, ending a winless run of 41 games which saw them employ six different coaches, lasted 14 months and featured an unorthodox protest by the players.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/A-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
