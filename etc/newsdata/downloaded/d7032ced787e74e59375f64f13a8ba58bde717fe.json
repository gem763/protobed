Africa\u2019s youngest leader quickly announced dramatic reforms and \u201cAbiymania\u201d began.\n\nIn a move that caused surprise in the long-turbulent Horn of Africa region, he said Ethiopia would accept a peace agreement with Eritrea, ending one of Africa\u2019s longest-running conflicts.\n\nWithin weeks, Eritrea\u2019s longtime leader, visibly moved, visited Addis Ababa and communications and transport links were restored. For the first time in two decades people could, long-divided families made tearful reunions.\n\nThe improving relations led to the lifting of United Nations sanctions on Eritrea, one of the world\u2019s most reclusive nations. But Ethiopia\u2019s reforms appear not to have inspired any in Eritrea, which has since closed border posts with its neighbor.\n\nAt home, Abiy offered one political surprise after another. He released tens of thousands of prisoners, welcomed home once-banned opposition groups and acknowledged past abuses. People expressed themselves freely on social media, and he announced that Ethiopia would hold free and fair elections in 2020. The country has one of the world\u2019s few \u201cgender-balanced\u201d Cabinets and a female president, a rarity in Africa.\n\nAnd for the first time Ethiopia had no journalists in prison, media groups noted last year.\n\nThe new prime minister also announced the opening-up of Ethiopia\u2019s tightly controlled economy, saying private investment would be welcome in major state-owned sectors \u2014 a process that continues slowly.\n\nBut while Abiy became a global darling, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, troubles arose at home.\n\nA grenade was thrown at him during an appearance in the capital. A large group of soldiers confronted him in his office in what he called an attempt to derail his reforms. In a display of the brio that has won Abiy widespread admiration, the former military officer defused the situation by dropping to the floor and joining the troops in push-ups.\n\nMore troubling these days are Ethiopia\u2019s rising ethnic tensions, as people once stifled by repression now act on long-held grievances. Some 1,200 people have been killed and some 1.2 million displaced in the greatest challenge yet to Abiy\u2019s rule. Some observers warn that the unrest will grow ahead of next year\u2019s election.\n\nAbiy had been among the favorites for this year\u2019s prize in the run-up to Friday\u2019s announcement, though winners are notoriously hard to predict. The Nobel committee doesn\u2019t reveal the names of candidates or nominations for 50 years.\n\nSince 1901, 99 Nobel Peace Prizes have been handed out, to individuals and 24 organizations. While the other prizes are announced in Stockholm, the peace prize is awarded in the Norwegian capital, Oslo.\n\nSo far this week, 11 Nobel laureates have been named. The others received their awards for their achievements in medicine, physics, chemistry and literature.\n\nWith the glory comes a 9-million kronor ($918,000) cash award, a gold medal and a diploma. Even though the peace prize is awarded in Norway, the amount is denominated in Swedish kronor.", "description": "The 2019 Nobel Peace has been awarded to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT122_abiy_a_ZG_20191011052826.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
