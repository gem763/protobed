Wait a minute. We have so much to discuss. I'm gathering thoughts. Where did you get these photos???'\n\nThe series of images, shared by popular Instagram account Every Outfit on SATC, show the petite and eternally stylish actress makeup-free, slipping into ethereal gowns by the likes of Chanel; dresses that would never make it into the fictional Vogue wedding spread in the movie.\n\nUnearthed: Rarely-seen photos unearthed by a fan account show Sarah Jessica Parker and stylist Patricia Field (right) choosing the bridal looks for the 2008 movie\n\nCouture: Parker tries on a Christian Lacroix gown from the designer's Fall 2007 couture collection - one that would eventually find itself in the fictional Vogue spread\n\nGuessing game: Knowledgeable fashion figures weighed in as to what designers were responsible for each gown, although the designer of this particular one is still unknown\n\n'Behold! The rarely-seen photos from Carrie's wedding dress fitting. We would definitely make a case for the more colorful, ornate options, which speak to Ms. Bradshaw's anti-establishment streak,' the caption reads.\n\n'But then again, being jilted at the altar in a white poufy gown is infinitely more humiliating. Sometimes you have to pick the story over the fashion\u2060 - even on Sex and the City.'\n\nThe nine photos were originally published in the Sex and the City book that came out in conjunction with the 2008 movie.\n\nBeaded: Parker tries an embellished Oscar de la Renta gown on for size - another one that would find itself immortalized in the film\n\nFan: Even SJP herself was shocked to see the 12-year-old photos from 2007 reappear on her feed\n\nVolume: The 5'3 star is virtually drowned in a cascade of ruffles; unsurprisingly this wedding dress didn't make the cut\n\nEmbroidered: A layered and embroidered gown, designer unknown, is trialed by Parker and a whole crew of wardrobe assistants\n\nIn response to Sarah, designer Chelsea Fairless and writer-director Lauren Garroni, who run the account which has 611,000 followers, told the style star that they would happily 'archive' anymore Polaroids she finds lying around.\n\nLongtime stylist Patricia Field can be seen in the photos, and eagle-eyed commentors also noticed her collaborator, stylist and costume designer Danny Santiago in the pictures.\n\nThe account called for fans to weigh in if they knew what designers had created the dresses pictured. It's believed that at least three of the gowns were by French couturier Christian Lacroix and one is tagged Chanel.\n\nTwo of the dresses pictured at the behind-the-scenes fittings were actually worn by Carrie in the movie - albeit with styling updates.\n\nOoh la la: An assistant helps Parker into a beaded and feathered bridal gown, designed by the late Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel\n\n'Anti establishment': As Carrie was known for her quirky and offbeat style choices, fans suggested this 'regal' look was 'on brand'\n\nThink pink: Her character Carrie was fond of a bubble hem dress, but perhaps not for the big day\n\nOne woman commented to say that one of the dresses was by Oscar de la Renta; something she was sure of as she had worn it for the own big day.\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of people chimed in about their favorite looks.\n\n'Difficult to choose, Carrie Bradshaw looks great in everything, even the ones that aren't my favorite,' said one follower.\n\n'Can you imagine being SJP and literally anything you put on looks like it was personally designed and made for you? What a queen,' said another.\n\n'Carrie's fashion was everything,' echoed a similar sentiment.\n\nIn the movie, Carrie wore seven high fashion bridal looks from Vera Wang, Caroline Herrera, Christian Lacroix, Lanvin, Dior, Oscar de la Renta and Vivienne Westwood for a Patrick Demarchelier shoot that would appear in Vogue.\n\nVogue material: Carrie modeled a frothy Vera Wang number for her Vogue shoot\n\n'The last single girl': As the fictional character was finally due to wed, Vogue enlisted her to try on the most notable bridal looks of 2007 (Carolina Herrera on the left and Lanvin on the right)\n\nDrama! Carrie spins around in Vivienne Westwood, left, and poses in Dior by John Galliano, right, for photographer Patrick Demarchelier in the memorable montage\n\nThe ones that made it: The Oscar de la Renta dress, left, and the Christian Lacroix gown, right, as seen in the behind-the-scenes photos actually did appear in the final cut\n\n'The dress upped the ante': Carrie stepped out in the memorable Vivienne Westwood gown (and a turquoise bird hair piece) for her supposed wedding\n\nAnd of course, it was the $15,000 taffeta and silk gown by Westwood that would make its way to Carrie's apartment in time for her ill-fated nuptials with Mr Big.\n\nThat same dress, a part of movie fashion history by now, was actually on display in New York last year at the label's flagship store in honor of the 10th anniversary of the film.\n\nUltimately, Carrie said her vows in a 'dress by no one' (a term immortalized by wedding planner Anthony Marantino - aka, a vintage silk skirt suit which she teamed with her signature Manolo Blahniks. (Likely helping to put the footwear brand's $1,000 crystal Hangisi style on the map in the process!)\n\nKeeping it simple: For her actual ceremony, Carrie wore a fitted ivory blazer and knee length skirt that she had found in a vintage store\n\nVintage: Wedding planner Anthony Marantino was horrified at the idea of Carrie wearing 'a dress by no one'\n\nIt's not unusual for Parker (or Kristin Davis or Cynthia Nixon) to interact with posts on the Every Outfit on Sex & The City page, which was established by Los Angeles-based duo Fairless and Garroni in June 2016.\n\nWatch this space: Parker steps out in mismatched stilettos and a Zac Posen gown for the Annual New York City Ballet Fall Fashion Gala hinting at a 'mismatched' footwear release\n\nParker is often on hand to debunk myths or settle speculation about certain outfits.\n\nIn June, she revealed the reason for the infamous mismatched shoes when Carrie visits LA.\n\nParker clarified, 'We had two pairs of what I believe are @louboutinworld scrappy sandals. Pat [Field] and I chose to do one of each. Perhaps because both were so delicious in color and seemed in harmony with the dress but also because we simply loved doing one of each.'\n\nWeeks later, it was revealed that Parker and the Instagram account creators are actually working on a collaboration involving mismatched shoes for Parker's SJP Collection footwear brand.\n\n'The Rogue sandal is coming this Spring and a portion of the proceeds will be donated to a very good cause. We're thrilled to be partnering with our faves at SJP Collection for this, stay tuned Carries....' the page teased.", "description": "In the 2008 Sex and the City movie, Carrie Bradshaw models couture bridal looks for a spread in Vogue.
