A mother was inserted with the wrong donor sperm resulting in a pregnancy in one case.\n\nThe error took place at the Simply Fertility clinic in Great Baddow, Chelmsford, during the mother's third cycle of IVF in October 2018.\n\nShe originally underwent fertility treatment in 2016 at the clinic using sperm from one donor but this was unsuccessful.\n\nA mother was inserted with the wrong donor sperm resulting in a pregnancy at the Simply Fertility clinic (pictured) in Great Baddow, Chelmsford, in October 2018\n\nIt was revealed in a report which also found the number of women being hit by a nasty condition linked to IVF is on the rise (stock)\n\nA second cycle using a different sperm donor worked and resulted in the birth of a child.\n\nThe couple then went back to the clinic in 2018 and asked to use the sperm again from the donor in the second cycle in order to give their child a full genetic sibling.\n\nBut because of a mix up with paperwork, sperm from the first unsuccessful treatment was used. The mistake was only realised after the embryo had been transferred to the woman.\n\nThe HFEA report that the couple were invited to the centre where the error was explained, and an apology provided alongside the offer of further support.\n\nThe couple reported a positive pregnancy test and said they intended to continue with the pregnancy.\n\nThe other major error saw an incorrect gas cylinder hooked up to chamber filled with several embryos from multiple patients, resulting in their death or damage.\n\nThe HFEA said it was looking into arranging the gas storage facilities so that mixed gases are stored in separate areas and clearly labelled.\n\nIt said it would also include a two person check before attaching cylinders to the incubators.\n\nSally Cheshire CBE, chair of the HFEA - a branch of the Department of Health and Social Care, said that 'any incident is one too many'.\n\nThe report, by fertility regulator the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, also found the number of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, or OHSS, cases were on the rise.\n\nThere were 156 cases of the painful and potentially fatal condition linked to IVF in 2018-19, compared to 135 the year before.\n\nOf these, 104 cases were severe and the woman had to go to hospital. In the remaining 52 the condition was treated with painkillers at home.\n\nThought to affect a third of women who have IVF, it triggers the woman's ovaries to swell to a dangerous size and become painful.\n\nThe statistics raise concern that clinics are giving women high doses of drugs to boost their ovaries so they produce more than the normal one egg a month.\n\nOHSS is caused by powerful IVF drugs which stimulate the ovaries to produce extra eggs.\n\nIn severe cases, OHSS can lead to rapid weight gain, abdominal pain, vomiting and leave victims struggling to breathe.\n\nThe condition can also kill, although there have been no deaths from OHSS reported by clinics across the UK.\n\nMs Cheshire said: 'We have done a lot of work with clinics to raise awareness of OHSS and improve the reporting of it.\n\nWHAT IS OVARIAN HYPERSTIMULATION SYNDROME? Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) can affect women undergoing IVF or other fertility procedures. It occurs when they take injectable hormones to stimulate the development of eggs in the ovaries. Too much hormone medication can cause the ovaries to become swollen and painful. In severe cases it can lead to rapid weight gain, abdominal pain, vomiting and shortness of breath. In rare cases, OHSS occurs after taking oral fertility treatments or even just spontaneously. Symptoms typically begin within ten days of taking injectable medications. In mild cases they can include: Moderate abdominal pain\n\nBloating or an increased waist size\n\nNausea and vomiting\n\nDiarrhoea\n\nSudden weight gain of more than 6.6lbs (3kg) These symptoms often ease within a week without treatment. In severe cases, symptoms include: Rapid weight gain of 33-44lbs (15-20kg) within five-ten days\n\nSevere abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting\n\nBlood clots in the legs\n\nReduced urination\n\nShortness of breath\n\nTight or enlarged abdomen In around 1-2 per cent of cases, OHSS can be life-threatening and lead to: Fluid in the abdomen or chest\n\nBlood clots\n\nKidney failure\n\nOvary twisting\n\nRupture of an ovarian cyst, leading to bleeding\n\nBreathing problems\n\nMiscarriage\n\nDeath Severe sufferers may require IV fluids in hospital and drugs to suppress their ovarian activity. Surgery may be necessary if an ovarian cyst bursts, as well as anticoagulants if clots have occurred. OHSS' exact cause is unknown but is thought to be due a hormone called HCG, which triggers the release of an egg. Ovarian blood vessels react abnormally to HCG and begin to leak fluid, which causes swelling that can move into the abdomen.

We have taken steps to improve the way that clinics advise patients of the risks of OHSS and what a patient should do if they feel unwell.\n\n'We also require clinics to work with local hospitals to ensure that any woman suffering from suspected OHSS is treated appropriately.'\n\nMs Chehire said: 'The number of incidents reported remains low at less than one per cent of all treatment cycles.\n\n'Incidents fall into three categories, with this year's report showing an increasing proportion of grade B incidents.\n\n'These resulted largely from greater awareness among clinics of the need to report these.'\n\nShe added: 'To make the sector even better and safer for patients there is more work to do.\n\n'It's good news that clinics have reduced the number of minor incidents, but we're concerned that any incident is one too many.\n\n'We will continue to ensure that the whole sector learns from any clinic incident, however minor, to understand what went wrong and, crucially, that steps are taken to ensure it does not happen again.'\n\nOn top of the 294 serious blunders, there were 266 'minor errors', which involved eggs being rendered unusable in the laboratory.\n\nThe HFEA found there were also 44 'near misses', where errors which had the potential 'to cause injury or ill health' were narrowly avoided.\n\nThe latest report also found that multiple births - the single biggest health risk from IVF - also reached an all-time low of 10 per cent.\n\nWhile having more than one baby is not inherently bad, it significantly increases the risk of complications for the mother and babies.\n\nProblems associated with multiple births include miscarriages, pregnancy-related high blood pressure and gestational diabetes.\n\nThe overall number of non-compliances per inspection has decreased each year since 2015/16 and over half of clinics had fewer areas of concern compared with their previous inspection.\n\nOverall, there were 351 non-compliances in 2018-19, down from 457 in 2015-16. However, the HFEA said there was some room for improvement, with more non-compliances relating to medicines management being classed as major and critical.\n\nThere were 37 non-compliances in this area in 2018-19, of which six were critical and 24 were major, up from a total of 25 the year before.\n\nOn infection control, there were 25 in 2018/19, up from 15, and there were 11 non-compliances for legal parenthood, up from six.\n\nLegal parenthood consent is essential to enable the patient's partner to become the legal parent of any children.\n\nDr Raj Mathur, secretary of the British Fertility Society said: 'We are pleased to see that the year-on-year increase in incident reporting continues; the fuller the picture we have, the better.\n\n'Signs such as the reduction in multiple births tell us that standards are improving alongside an increase in patient numbers.\n\n'We will continue to work, as a community, to make improvements in the areas highlighted by the report.\n\n'This report reinforces the fact that the culture of the sector is as important as the details of its successes and shortcomings; we are proud to be part of making that culture one of openness and excellence.'", "description": "The error took place at the Simply Fertility clinic in Great Baddow, Chelmsford, during the mother-to-be's third cycle of IVF in October 2018.
