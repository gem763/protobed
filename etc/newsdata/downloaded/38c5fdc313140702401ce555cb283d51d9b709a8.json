Benching Adrian Peterson didn\u2019t help.", "language": "en", "text": "Sports columnist\n\nThis is a test, and it is a test that matters for the Washington Redskins and their coach, Jay Gruden.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s yesterday\u2019s news,\u201d right tackle Morgan Moses said of the benching of Adrian Peterson, when someone asked him, \u201cIs that yesterday\u2019s news?\u201d Take the easy off-ramp, Morgan. It\u2019s right there for you.\n\nThis is touchy. It was touchy Sunday, when Gruden and his staff decided not to dress Peterson and blamed it on a numbers game, a numbers game that didn\u2019t add up to veterans in the locker room. And it\u2019s touchy still, even though the running back Gruden wanted to build his game plan around, second-year man Derrius Guice, is not expected to play in Sunday\u2019s home opener against Dallas because of a knee injury.\n\nHey, Donald Penn. You\u2019re the left tackle who\u2019s blocking for these guys. Is this team over that controversy?\n\n\u201cMan, I just got here,\u201d Penn said. \u201cMan, I\u2019m going to stay out of that. I\u2019m going to leave it at that.\u201d\n\nIf this was something other than a nuclear question, then why treat it as if you couldn\u2019t answer it without wearing a hazmat suit?\n\nAs controversies surrounding the Washington football team go, Guice-over-Peterson is nothing really special. It falls under the \u201cIt\u2019s always something with these guys\u201d category, because it\u2019s always something with these guys. The success of this season didn\u2019t hinge on whether Peterson was active in Sunday\u2019s loss at Philadelphia, and it won\u2019t hinge on whether Guice can play against Dallas. Philadelphia is better than Washington, regardless of who plays running back. Dallas is better than Washington, regardless of who plays running back.\n\nBut this team can\u2019t help but feed the made-for-talk-radio beast, so we have this. (Aside: it\u2019s kind of remarkable that it has overtaken Trent Williams\u2019s continued absence as the buzziest topic in Ashburn.)\n\nWhat\u2019s important, though, is how Gruden handles it, now and going forward. Guice\u2019s injury \u2014 suffered at some point in a 10-carry, 18-yard effort against the Eagles \u2014 likely solves the problem for the coach this week. Peterson will play. Guice will sit. But that\u2019s this week only.\n\n[With Peterson, Redskins have two options: Play him or release him]\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all in the past,\u201d Gruden said Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ll worry about when they\u2019re both healthy again, if that decision ever has to come again.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s coming, Jay. It\u2019s coming.\n\nPut aside whether you think Peterson, a Hall of Famer-to-be, or Guice, who missed all of his rookie season with a torn ACL , is the better choice to be Washington\u2019s top back. What this whole situation highlights is the predicament Gruden is in, trying to save his job with a roster that looks more like it\u2019s building for the future.\n\nThat not dressing Peterson would be jarring to the locker room shouldn\u2019t have been surprising \u2014 to anyone.\n\n\u201cKnowing what kind of player he is, and knowing how much he inspired not just me but all the players in here, to not have him up, it was kind of disappointing,\u201d said Wendell Smallwood.\n\nWho\u2019s Wendell Smallwood, you ask? Well, it\u2019s a good question. He\u2019s the fourth-year running back Washington picked up the week before the season opener after he had been cut by the Eagles. Smallwood was given a jersey Sunday, as was linebacker Tanner Vallejo, because they can play special teams and Peterson can\u2019t. Gruden was thrilled by how they performed in punt coverage.\n\nYet here was Smallwood, sitting in his still-new locker room Wednesday, mulling over the strange reality: The coaches wanted him to play and Adrian Peterson to sit.\n\n\u201cWhether it was me that was up instead, or whoever, I think we were all kind of disappointed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s the nature of the business. I know what he can do. The team knows what he can do. We know what kind of guy we got in our room.\u201d\n\nGruden may say this is in the past, but it\u2019s clearly delicate in the present. That\u2019s in part because the coach is at the beginning of his sixth season with exactly zero job security. Imagine a first-year coach, granted the keys to the franchise and responsible for articulating a vision for the future, saying Peterson wouldn\u2019t play. The locker room might not like it, but there would be an element of fear, too, because veterans would know that the coach was empowered to put his plan in place, and they could be gone before he was.\n\nConversely, imagine an entrenched coach \u2014 not just Bill Belichick, but Mike Tomlin or Andy Reid or Pete Carroll or even Sean McVay \u2014 doing the same. The players would have to acknowledge that the coach controls their futures. His decisions matter, and are final.\n\nGruden doesn\u2019t belong in either camp. Moses, the sixth-year tackle, expressed his surprise at Peterson\u2019s benching after Sunday\u2019s game, then doubled down on an appearance Monday morning on \u201cThe Junkies\u201d on 106.7 The Fan, calling the move a \u201cslap in the face\u201d and saying, as a veteran, he would have to express his opinion. He declined Wednesday to advance the conversation, but the entire exchange is indicative of what Gruden is trying to handle. He has to relay a message about why he did what he did, and understand that \u201cWell, we needed this guy on special teams\u201d wasn\u2019t going to mollify those who felt a proud veteran had been unnecessarily embarrassed.\n\n\u201cI have relayed it, and it is important for sure,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cThis line loves blocking for Adrian Peterson. He\u2019s a big guy. The line likes to block for Derrius Guice. But we only have one ball.\u201d\n\nI understand why Gruden prefers Guice over Peterson. If Gruden is going to be part of the future here \u2014 a big if, of course \u2014 Guice is going to be part of the reason. Peterson was signed off the street only because of Guice\u2019s injury last summer, and his 1,042-yard season was a statistical outlier. In the previous half century, only three backs age 33 or older \u2014 Frank Gore, Franco Harris and John Riggins (twice) \u2014 rushed for 1,000 yards.\n\nKudos to Peterson for being the fourth. But it also creates a dual reality: Peterson is a back that teammates would look at as unassailable, deserving of the opportunity to go out on his own terms. But he\u2019s also a figure coaches could reasonably say they had milked everything out of.\n\nHere, then, is Gruden, entering Week 2 of his sixth season, dealing with the controversy du jour. He said he has talked to Peterson, who is in \u201ca good place.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel very good if his number is called this week he\u2019ll be ready to go and play very hard,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be Adrian Peterson.\u201d\n\nThis is a test. It is only a test. But it\u2019s a test of how a coach whose future is on shifting sands can unify a locker room that knows just that, even as that locker room clearly has an allegiance to a teammate. Jay Gruden\u2019s authority is under examination here, both by his players and the people who will determine whether he remains the coach.", "description": "In his sixth year, the Redskins\u2019 coach may have finally found the trick to getting his players on the same page \u2014 keeping a respected veteran on the sideline for the opener.", "authors": ["Barry Svrluga", "Sports Columnist With Beat Writing Experience On Baseball", "Golf", "The Nfl", "College Basketball", "College Football", "Sports Columnist", "September At Am", "Barry Svrluga Became A Sports Columnist For The Washington Post In December He Arrived At The Post In To Cover Football", "Basketball At The University Of Maryland"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hP5TVyF-c308YF3gapVnqSLINJA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I6ZFKXGTHMI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
