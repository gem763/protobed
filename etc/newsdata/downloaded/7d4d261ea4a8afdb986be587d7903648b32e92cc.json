Bombers are powerful, mobile and visible \u2014 perfect for signalling strength and intent.\n\nOn the other hand, the U.S. Navy\u2019s submarine-launched cruise missiles are less effective \u2014 even counterproductive \u2014 for crisis stability \u2026 because they\u2019re invisible most of the time.\n\n\u201cSLCMs could contribute to the instability,\u201d Morgan wrote. \u201c[T]he opponent\u2019s anxieties might be magnified by the ability of SSGNs [cruise missile subs] to posture in stealth nearby.\u201d\n\nBut Morgan pointed out one instance when the Navy\u2019s Ohio-class SSGNs actually did help stabilize a crisis back in 2010 \u2014 a feat mostly lost to history.\n\n\u201cIn July 2010, three SSGNs surfaced nearly simultaneously in Western Pacific and Indian Ocean waters, allegedly to signal U.S. displeasure over Chinese missile tests in the East China Sea.\u201d\n\nMajor missile tests are potentially provocative and destabilizing. America\u2019s intent in the aftermath of the Chinese tests was to signal U.S. strength with just the right amount and kind of potential force.\n\nSubmarines seemed to fit the bill, as if Washington were saying to Beijing, \u201cSure, you might surprise us with your missiles. But we remember we have plenty of missiles of our own \u2014 and they\u2019re not far from you.\u201d\n\nGreg Torode reported on the incident for the South China Morning Post:\n\nThe appearance of the USS Michigan in Pusan, South Korea, the USS Ohio in Subic Bay, in The Philippines and the USS Florida in the strategic Indian Ocean outpost of Diego Garcia not only reflects the trend of escalating submarine activity in East Asia, but carries another threat as well. \u2026\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Submarines are useful for signaling intent.", "authors": ["David Axe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vJvAChH.6Mni0IeXdI3gyg--~B/aD05NjE7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/620ee53abf5b313054593547e77ad5f0", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
