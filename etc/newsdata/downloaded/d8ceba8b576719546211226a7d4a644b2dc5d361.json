One veteran journalists had never seen anything like it before.\n\n\"In 15 years at #TIFF I have never seen a standing ovation like the one for Renee Zellweger at JUDY. I started this about a minute into it and it only stopped because she made us,\" one critic wrote.\n\nIn the clip, you see the humbled actress fight back tears, then tell the audience to stop so she doesn't mess up her makeup.\n\nIn 15 years at #TIFF I have never seen a standing ovation like the one for Renee Zellweger at JUDY.

Vary (@adambvary) September 11, 2019\n\nAll the posts are pretty much the same, in awe of her new film and the performance.\n\nIn the film, we see Garland 30 years after she shot to stardom in \"The Wizard of Oz,\" as she prepares for a sold-out run of concerts in London in 1968.\n\nHer voice isn\u2019t what it once was, and she\u2019s battling an addiction to pills, but through it all she tries to be a good mother to her children, Joey Luft, Lorna Luft and Liza Minnelli, and even manages to find love again with her soon-to-be fifth husband Mickey Deans, played by Finn Wittrock. Sadly, she would be gone just a year later.\n\n\"Judy\" hits theaters on Sept. 27.", "description": "In what's billed as her comeback, Renee Zellweger got an epic ovation Tuesday night in Toronto for her role in", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/garland-1-ht-er-190708_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
