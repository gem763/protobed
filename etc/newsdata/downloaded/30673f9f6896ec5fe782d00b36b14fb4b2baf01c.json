It is a dream as a referee,\u201d said Garces, who also took charge of the blockbuster South Africa v New Zealand pool match on the opening weekend.\n\nAt Japan 2019, he has also refereed Ireland v Russia and Wales v Fiji at the pool stage, as well as the quarter-final between England and Australia and the semi-final where South Africa narrowly beat Wales.\n\n\u2013 Golden goodbye \u2013\n\nGarces has enjoyed a glittering final year of his career after he refereed the European Champions Cup final between Leinster and Saracens in May, as well as the French Top 14 final between Toulouse and Clermont in June.\n\nDuring the World Cup, he has brandished a total of six yellow cards \u2014 two against Russia when they were playing Ireland, and two to each team in the physical Wales v Fiji pool match.\n\nDespite a number of red cards at this World Cup, mostly for high tackles, he has not sent anyone off.\n\nIn both of the Springbok games he has refereed, he has penalised the South Africans nine times. He blew up against England eight times in their match against Australia.\n\nSome Springbok fans will not cheer his appointment. A group of South Africa supporters set up an online petition to stop Garces officiating their semi-final, attracting more than 13,000 signatures.\n\nEnglishman Wayne Barnes, ineligible for the final after England qualified, will take charge of the third-place play-off in Tokyo on Friday between Wales and New Zealand \u2014 as he did in 2011.\n\nPeyper wasn\u2019t selected for the semis after a viral photo showed him posing with Wales fans holding out his right elbow \u2014 after sending off France\u2019s Sebastien Vahaamahina for elbowing Welsh flanker Aaron Wainwright in the quarter-finals.\n\nPeyper released an apologetic statement in which he admitted the picture was \u201cinappropriate\u201d. But he appears to have earned a reprieve after his selection as a touch judge for Friday\u2019s play-off.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 French referee Jerome Garces will take charge of Saturday\u2019s Rugby World Cup final between England and South Africa, the first", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/84694d_referee-jerome-garces-charge-final-dream-farewell-as-frenchman-garces-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
