Hiring fell well short of the 170,000 MarketWatch forecast.\n\nThe gain in new jobs was even weaker if hiring tied to the upcoming U.S. Census is stripped out. The private sector added fewer than 100,000 new jobs last month, the government said Friday.\n\nThe unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.7%.\n\nU.S. stocks rose in Friday trades in anticipation of a reduction in interest rates.\n\nRead: Jobs report called \u2018meh\u2019 as hiring slows\n\nA few big caveats: The government\u2019s initial estimate of new jobs created in August has missed Wall Street\u2019s forecast by an average of 43,000 in seven of the past 10 years.\n\nWith so many people on vacation, the number of respondents to the government\u2019s monthly questionnaire is often the lowest of the year. As more responses are returned, the government usually ends up revising job growth higher.\n\nEmployment gains also appeared to be more robust in August based on a broader if more volatile survey of households, though the start of school usually has something to do with it.\n\nSome 571,000 people entered the labor force in August and nearly 590,000 found work \u2014 the biggest advance in 18 months.\n\nWhat happened: Professional and business services led the way again in hiring by adding 37,000 new jobs. Health-care providers boosted employment by 24,000 and financial companies created 15,000 new positions.\n\nLast month the federal government increased payrolls by 28,000, mostly temporary workers needed to help prepare the Census that takes place every 10 years.\n\nRetailers and energy companies cut jobs. Under siege from online competitors, traditional brick-and-mortar retailers have reduced employment for seven months in a row. And oil drillers are coping with lower petroleum prices.\n\nEmployment gains for July and June, meanwhile, were revised down by a combined 20,000.\n\nA slowdown in hiring, however, is not leading to slower wage growth.\n\nThe amount of money the average worker earns shot up 11 cents to $28.11 an hour, keeping the increase over the past year at a healthy 3.2%. Wage gains look even stronger over the past three months, suggesting that inflation could creep higher in the months ahead if that keeps up.\n\nBig picture: The economy is not growing as fast and the softening labor market offers clear proof.\n\nThe U.S. had added an average of 150,000 new jobs a month in the past six months, down from 232,000 at the beginning of the year. The dropoff is evident even if hiring in August turns out to be stronger than initially reported.\n\nYet rising wages, steady hiring and the lowest unemployment rate in half a century are giving consumers enough confidence to keep spending at levels likely to help the U.S. avert recession even as the rest of the world struggles to grow.\n\nThe Fed hopes to give the economy an extra shot in the arm \u2014 an inoculation of sorts \u2014 by reducing interest rates.\n\nRead: Service-oriented firms grow faster in August, cushion economy from China trade war\n\nAlso: U.S. manufacturing index falls below key 50 mark that sometimes signals recession\n\nWhat they are saying? \u201cWhen the numbers soften like this the economy is slowing,\u201d said chief U.S. economist Steven Blitz of TS Lombard.\n\n\u201cThe labor market remains strong and represents a solid recession buffer, although job growth is slowing as we approach full employment,\u201d said Curt Long, chief economist at the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions.\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.26% and S&P 500 index SPX, +0.09% have been rising on renewed hopes that the U.S. and China will strike a trade deal or at least tamp down elevated tensions.\n\nRead: The U.S. economy just entered a record-shattering 11th year of expansion\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.05% was little changed at 1.56%.", "description": "The economy added just 130,000 new jobs in August, marking the smallest increase in three months and offering more evidence that hiring has slowed amid a...", "authors": ["Jeffry Bartash"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ814_payrol_ZG_20190906085617.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
