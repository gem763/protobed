That means they might keep two or three super schemes with $300,000 cover in each scheme,\" he says.\n\n\u201cThe inactive fund rule means those policies could be cancelled. They should be contacting their funds urgently to maintain the cover.\u201d\n\nStreamlining the system\n\nThe federal government began rolling out a program called Protecting Your Superannuation (PYS) on July 1 as part of a range of budget measures intended to streamline the nation's $2.9 trillion super system, help savers lower costs and build capital to boost retirement returns.\n\nThe ATO was enlisted to streamline online payroll systems to help super members use their existing accounts rather than automatically switching into default funds provided by employers.\n\nInactive accounts with balances of below $6000 will be sent to the ATO, which will use sophisticated data-matching processes to transfer the cash to savers' active accounts.\n\nPYS will cap fees at 3 per cent for account balances below $6000. In addition, exit fees will be banned when switching accounts and scheme members will have to opt in to life insurance cover for inactive accounts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA typical fund\u2019s expenses cover administration, investments, switching, buy/sell spread fees, insurance and exit costs. Before the changes, fees and other costs continued to be deducted from small accounts until all the contributions were spent.\n\nSome not-for-profit funds have increased administration costs by between 50 per cent and 100 per cent during the past 12 months, according to industry specialists.\n\nPeople too often put consolidating or reviewing their super in the too-hard basket. \u2014 Finder.com spokesman\n\nFinder.com, which monitors financial products, says hundreds of thousands of super savers, such as Hungerford-Moran, sign on to their employers\u2019 schemes without considering alternatives.\n\nTheir accounts, as in the case of Hungerford-Moran, will appear to be inactive to the ATO because they have not made any additional contributions for the past 16 months and have shown little, or no, interest in performance, such as changing investment options, insurance cover or amending a binding beneficiary nomination.\n\n\u201cThey too often put consolidating or reviewing their super in the too-hard basket, which can lead to duplication of costs if they change jobs,\u201d a Finder spokesman says.\n\nAccording to the Productivity Commission, about one in three of all super accounts are \u201cunintended multiples\u201d opened when employees change jobs but fail to close previous accounts.\n\nThe commission warns that there are 6 million member accounts in high-performing funds \u2013 many of them the big industry funds \u2013 but another 1.7 million are in funds \"experiencing serial underperformance\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom April 1, the second phase of the changes \u2013 Putting Members' Interests First \u2013 will require members under 25 and those with balances under $6000 to opt in for life insurance.\n\nThe exception is for members in hazardous occupations, such as mining, who will continue to get the insurance.\n\nFor young super savers such as Hungerford-Moran, who is working part-time during his environmental science studies, it means tens of thousands of dollars will be directed into investments rather than unneeded insurance premiums and unwanted administrative fees over the coming decades.\n\nOlder super savers with multiple schemes also need to eliminate duplication and channel more of their savings into high performing funds with relatively low fees to increase long-term returns, says Moran.\n\nHurting returns\n\nHe says multiple insurance policies can have a big impact on the investment returns of small balances.\n\nFor example, a super saver with $12,000 spread across three funds and three insurance policies could pay a total of $600 a year in insurance premiums. That means returns of 5 per cent \u2013 or $600 \u2013 will be used to pay for life cover rather than building capital and investment returns.\n\nMost big funds have improved their procedures for merging or switching funds, industry specialists say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoran says those who have multiple schemes for the automatic, or default, insurance, should urgently review their cover.\n\nThe insurance is offered without the need for a fund member to provide any medical history or financial details.\n\nMembers simply start paying a premium for a default level of insurance on joining their fund. Many scheme members maintain a minimum balance to keep the cover.\n\nIt is possible to check low-balance and defunct super accounts by registering with the ATO\u2019s online service myGov, which also enables seamless switching between super funds.\n\nIt allows members to view details of all super accounts, including those lost or forgotten.\n\nThey can also find super held on their behalf by the ATO when their super fund, employer or the government has not been able to find an account into which to deposit the funds.", "description": "Government changes mean young savers won't be paying unnecessary premiums, but older members will need to act before April to keep their policies in low-balance funds.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5904%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_948%2C$y_402/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d21208741c01c2cc0322831cff0217c8c52ce2f5", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
