But he is old enough at 24 to remember when racism wasn\u2019t a regular part of the round-ball game, when rivalries came without the vilification of players and fans for the colour of their skin.\n\n\u201cIt sends a poor message about the game of football,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame because it\u2019s such a beautiful game and it\u2019s being tarred by people with racist thoughts and racist minds. It\u2019s terrible that they have to experience that when they just want to go out and play the game they love. I\u2019m very happy that for the most part in rugby there\u2019s a different climate and that kind of stuff doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nItoje added: \u201cI\u2019m sure, a couple of years ago, when this sort of thing wasn\u2019t as rife in football, they assumed that it was all ok. I remember a period when I didn\u2019t really hear much about racism in football, but then over the last two years there have been several incidents; with Raheem Sterling, with Dele Alli and with a whole number of black players who play for England or in the Premier League.\n\n\u201cI think it is important to never just assume that these things are all hunky-dory \u2013 it is something that we have to keep on top of.\u201d\n\nThe thing is, as Itoje says, rugby isn\u2019t safe against discrimination either. Those outside of the sport easily fall into the trap of feeling it is immune from the horrors of what happened in Bulgaria, yet Itoje is well aware that it isn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI know people in rugby who have experienced it in the professional game and grass roots,\u201d he alarmingly said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important never to just assume that this is a free zone from any form of discrimination. I think rugby is probably \u2013 from the sports that I\u2019ve seen \u2013 right up there in terms of integrity, in terms of respect and in terms of how they treat people. But I think it is important to never just assume that it\u2019s always going to be that way.\u201d\n\nItoje has long been an advocate of equality within a game that hasn\u2019t always shown it \u2013 and that is getting to terms with a new face within the professionalism era that sees the number of public school graduates at the top of the game on the rise \u2013 white or black.\n\nHowever, what really catches Itoje\u2019s attention is whether the football team was right or wrong to decide against walking off the pitch, despite threatening to do exactly that in the event of such racial abuse.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all for player empowerment,\u201d agrees Itoje. \u201cI\u2019m all for players speaking up when they feel there are injustices done to them, so that in itself is good. It is important for players who are subject to this kind of abuse and discrimination that they speak up and highlight the wrongs and the issues.\n\n\u201cBut I also think that the associations and teams need to take a tougher stand. They need to make it crystal clear ... I\u2019m not even sure what the punishment is. It needs to be more severe, because it is obviously not acting as a deterrent, especially when they go abroad to places like Bulgaria.\n\n\u201cI was reading something the other day about a Bulgarian reporter arguing with Gareth Southgate about whether it was racist or not. He walked out in a huff about it. That just shows how bad the issue is if you have press in that country arguing against what we would consider blatant discrimination. That probably highlights the magnitude of the problem we face.\u201d\n\nAs Itoje has previously said to The Independent, that issue spreads beyond sport to today\u2019s society but it is one that he can\u2019t fight alone, and one that he can\u2019t fight now. Itoje has a World Cup quarter-final game to play in two days\u2019 time, in a tournament that could well define him as a great of the game, yet even now the issue of colour, race and belief continues to tarnish sport, and sadly it seems it will not go away any time soon.", "description": "Maro Itoje has told rugby union not to make the same mistakes football has made over racism.
