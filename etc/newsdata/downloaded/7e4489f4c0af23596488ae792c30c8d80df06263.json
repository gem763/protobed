U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was dealt a serious defeat Tuesday after Britain's Supreme Court ruled his decision to suspend Parliament weeks ahead of Brexit was unlawful.\n\nJohnson disagreed with the verdict and said he would take the U.K. out of the EU by an Oct. 31 deadline. He has faced increased calls from lawmakers to resign following the ruling. MPs reconvened in parliament on Wednesday, with opposition lawmakers buoyed by the decision but split on the best approach to Brexit from here.\n\nIn corporate news, Deutsche Bank's Frankfurt offices were visited by German authorities on Wednesday seeking information in relation to Danske Bank, prosecutors said. The German lender's stock ended the session 0.5% higher.", "description": "Market focus was largely attuned to news of a bid from Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives to impeach President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Elliot Smith Ryan Browne", "Elliot Smith", "Ryan Browne"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103738929-GettyImages-542416748.jpg?v=1532564088"}
