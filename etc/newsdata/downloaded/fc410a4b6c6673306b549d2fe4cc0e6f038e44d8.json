I never thought I could feel sympathy for a Trump, but the president\u2019s fourth child has had a dreadful few days. On Thursday, President Trump\u2019s personal assistant, Madeleine Westerhout, was abruptly ousted from her position amid allegations that she had told reporters the president didn\u2019t like being photographed next to Tiffany because he thought she was fat. Westerhout also allegedly joked that Trump couldn\u2019t pick Tiffany out of a crowd.\n\nThose are pretty hurtful rumours \u2013 but, according to Trump, water under the bridge. On Saturday he tweeted that he forgave Westerhout, adding: \u201cI love Tiffany, doing great!\u201d\n\nThe 25-year-old, for her part, appears to have responded to the drama in the most millennial way possible \u2013 posting a quote from Rumi, the ancient Persian poet, to her Instagram story on Saturday. \u201cStudy me as much as you like, you will never know me,\u201d it read. \u201cFor I differ a hundred ways from what you see me to be \u2026 I have chosen to dwell in a place you can\u2019t see.\u201d\n\nTiffany, by the way, normally dwells at Georgetown University law school. While we may never fully know her, we know she has dabbled in all the usual famous-child activities such as modelling and singing. In 2011, she released a single, Like a Bird, which is surprisingly catchy. Sample lyrics include: \u201cFeel like I spot a bug crawlin\u2019 through the liquid love / You kill and you tweeted me, baby you go beep-beep-beep\u201d and \u201cI just want serenity / While living it up.\u201d\n\nAnd that, I think, is all we need to know about Tiffany. I hope whoever leaked Westerhout\u2019s alleged comments is having a belated crisis of conscience. It\u2019s true that Tiffany campaigned for her dad in 2016, so she isn\u2019t a wholly sympathetic figure. However, she hasn\u2019t courted the spotlight like her adult siblings and is not expected to join the 2020 campaign. If any of the Trumps deserve some serenity, it\u2019s Tiffany.\n\n\u2022 Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist", "description": "It\u2019s hard to feel sorry for a Trump \u2013 but I\u2019ll make an exception for Donald\u2019s fourth child, writes Arwa Mahdawi", "authors": ["Arwa Mahdawi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a7125aabf9e5b4fb3e3bac14f63cf0ae1671535/0_222_5798_3480/master/5798.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=f96f1fc64b9fe16f78092c4f209ba1d9"}
