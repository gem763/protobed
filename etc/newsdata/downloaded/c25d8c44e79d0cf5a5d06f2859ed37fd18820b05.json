Read more\n\nMerkel was said by an unnamed UK source to have told Johnson that Northern Ireland had to stay in the EU\u2019s customs union. The official claimed that as a consequence a deal looked \u201cessentially impossible, not just now but ever\u201d.\n\nTusk, the European council president, gave an insight into the frustration at the anonymous briefings over the Merkel call, the alleged content of which described by senior politicians in Berlin as \u201cimprobable\u201d. The chancellor\u2019s spokesman declined to comment on \u201cconfidential conversations\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game,\u201d Tusk wrote in a tweet directed at the prime minister. \u201cAt stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people. You don\u2019t want a deal, you don\u2019t want an extension, you don\u2019t want to revoke. Quo vadis? [Where are you going?]\u201d\n\nThe European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said: \u201cI do not accept this \u2018blame game\u2019 of pinning the eventual failure of the negotiations on the EU.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the case the explanation is actually in the British camp because the original sin is on the islands and not on the continent.\n\n\u201cNobody would come out a winner in this scenario. A no-deal Brexit would lead to a decline of the UK and a clear weakening of the roots of growth on the continent.\u201d\n\nJuncker said that Johnson\u2019s Brexit proposals would leave the UK with a relationship with the EU that was \u201cless intimate than with Canada\u201d.\n\nIn Berlin Detlef Seif, the point person on Brexit for Merkel\u2019s party, the CDU, rejected the account given by Downing Street of the call between the two leaders.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn my mind it is completely improbable that the phone call between Merkel and Johnson took place in the way it has been reported in the British media.\n\n\u201cIt would run counter to all the principles the German government has followed for the last three years, namely that the negotiations are led by the European commission.\n\n\u201cFor the German chancellor to insist on Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union would completely breach these guidelines.\u201d\n\nGermany has been one of the most outspoken advocates for allowing the UK as much flexibility as possible to avoid a no-deal scenario on 31 October or at a later date.\n\nThe unnamed Downing Street briefings have been widely attributed to Dominic Cummings, the former Vote Leave supremo who is now the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser.\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot of scepticism about Johnson\u2019s proposal in Berlin, but Merkel\u2019s attitude has always been a positive one, to find out if there is room for a compromise,\u201d Sief said.\n\n\u201cThe only explanation I can see for these reports is that Johnson is trying to build a story where he blames Germany for a no-deal Brexit. To brief out a confidential phone call in such a manner is utterly unprofessional and infuriating to anyone who has been working on a deal\u201d.\n\nOn Tuesday, Johnson spoke to the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, in a 40 minute call and agreed to meet later this week in what will be seen as a last-ditch chance to find a deal.\n\nThe briefings attributed to Cummings had suggested that Varadkar had gone back on his word by attacking Johnson\u2019s proposals for the Irish border, which involve a customs border on the island of Ireland and Northern Ireland staying in the single market for goods.\n\nIn Brussels, thinking is moving to how to react to what is seen as an inevitable request for an extension of the UK\u2019s EU membership.\n\nA debate among EU27 states over the end date for any extension is yet to take place.\n\nFollowing a meeting with Johnson in No 10 on Tuesday, the European parliament\u2019s president, David Sassoli, said there had been \u201cno progress\u201d in talks but MEPs were open to a Brexit extension.\n\nJohnson has repeatedly said that he will not comply with the Benn act, which would instruct him to request an extension by 19 October if a deal is not secured with the EU. He has also insisted that the UK will leave on 31 October with or without a deal.\n\nThe unnamed source had suggested to the Spectator magazine on Monday night that the UK would be a truculent member, blocking the EU\u2019s plans.\n\nBut the only key issue on which the UK could wield its veto would be the EU\u2019s seven-year budget which is unlikely to come to a vote until June, or September at the latest. \u201cWe could extend to September without any problem, but what would you achieve over the summer? So June seems more likely,\u201d said an EU diplomat.\n\n\u201cBeyond the UK being able to veto a budget, an end date by then is important because we don\u2019t want the UK to be in and net recipients to be able to argue that there is no reason for a cut to the budget.\u201d\n\nThe Benn act suggests an extension until the end of January 2020 but there will be some concern in EU capitals that this will not provide sufficient time for any fallout from a general election to play out.", "description": "Leaders summit to consider \u2018range of dates\u2019 next week, with current talks all but dead", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey", "Philip Oltermann"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50b0cd81c942c710be2da2e196140c0b4bdc7308/38_0_3426_2055/master/3426.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d64e2b3c3f08040f6318f1bdb6ace6c0", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
