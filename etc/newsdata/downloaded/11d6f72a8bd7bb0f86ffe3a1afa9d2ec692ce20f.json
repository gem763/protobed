Brinkley played a blonde bombshell driving a red Ferrari who kept running into Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) during a family road trip.\n\nEntertainment Weekly previously reported that like the original character, Brinkley plays with her tousled tresses and blows a flirty kiss while driving. However, Beverly Goldberg (Wendy McLendon-Covey) makes it clear her husband can\u2019t be lured like Griswold.\n\nBrinkley told the outlet that over the years she\u2019s been asked to reprise the role. However, she\u2019s only done it a few times: for the 1997 \u201cVacation\u201d sequel titled \u201cVegas Vacation,\u201d as well as the \u201cVacation\u201d-inspired DirecTV and Infiniti commercials.\n\nCHRISTIE BRINKLEY'S DAUGHTER DEFENDS HER FROM WENDY WILLIAMS' 'DWTS' SHADE\n\n\u201cI think this is a really good reprisal right here, and I think it fits because both families have that same dynamic,\u201d Brinkley explained. \u201cIn fact, when they wanted me to do the [2015 remake], they said, \u2018They\u2019ll open the door and it\u2019ll be you and Chevy together,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Oh, no! No, no, no, you guys would ruin everything because what we loved about the first movie was the fact that they can argue, they can carry on, but at the bottom of everything they stick together and they\u2019re a family. You can\u2019t break up that family.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I think that there are so many similarities in that family \u2014 they\u2019re overcoming obstacles and they don\u2019t want to admit how much they love each other so much,\u201d added Brinkley.\n\nEntertainment Weekly shared that for the first time in the 35-plus year history of the character, the \u201cgirl in the red Ferrari\u201d has a name \u2014 Aleah Welsh.\n\nThe scene was also filmed before Brinkley suffered a broken arm earlier this month while gearing up to appear on \u201cDancing with the Stars.\u201d Her daughter, fellow model Sailor Brinkley-Cook, has since taken her place in the televised competition.\n\n'ROOM 222' STAR KAREN VALENTINE RECALLS 'AWFUL' ENCOUNTER AFTER 'THE DATING GAME'\n\n\"My part was really easy,\u201d reflected Brinkley on bringing her iconic role to life again. \u201cAnd here we are with all these really great people. It\u2019s paying tribute to a film that\u2019s thirtysomething years old now and\u2026 the whole thing is just a bowl full of wonderful.\u201d\n\nCHRISTIE BRINKLEY OUT OF 'DANCING WITH THE STARS' AFTER SUFFERING SERIOUS INJURY, DAUGHTER SAILOR TO FILL IN\n\nBack in February of this year, Brinkley told Fox News she was happily embracing turning the big 6-5.\n\n\u201cI think that the number really doesn\u2019t represent the modern woman today,\u201d Brinkley explained at the time. \u201cIn the olden days, the numbers came with so many rules and so much weight on a woman. There were so many restrictions associated with certain numbers. Like after 30 you can\u2019t wear your skirt above your knee. After 40 you shouldn\u2019t wear your hair below your shoulders.\u201d\n\n\u201cNowadays, women are totally reshaping the numbers and giving those numbers a new image,\u201d she continued. \u201cTo me, to be turning 65, it really could be any number. The only thing is that once you pass 50, every birthday is an opportunity to take stock and say, \u2018What else do I want to do?\u2019 And then go for it!\n\nBrinkley also revealed how proud she was of her daughter, 21, launching a modeling career of her own.\n\nCHRISTIE BRINKLEY RECALLS BONDING WITH BILLY JOEL OVER MUSIC AFTER THEIR DIVORCE\n\n\u201cYou know, I feel some people might say, \u2018It must be so much easier with Christie Brinkley holding the door for her,\u2019\u201d said Brinkley. \u201cYes, but she has to still be able to keep that door open. She has to deal with the criticism and people claiming nepotism.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re alone in this career. You walk into a room full of strangers every single day that you go into modeling. There is no routine. Every day is different. Every day you need to stand there under a light while people whisper about you while you\u2019re being photographed. And yet you still need the confidence to project the look that they\u2019re wanting, get along with everybody and converse with everybody.\"\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t really know the amount of work it takes to be a model,\" Brinkley added. \"And nobody is holding her hand as she does this profession. \u2026 I\u2019m proud of her for being able to ignore the bullying or haters. In fact, she has empathy and compassion for them because they must be very unhappy to go out of their way to make a point to visit her personal page and write mean things.\u201d", "description": "Christie Brinkley is back behind the wheel as \u201cthe girl in the red Ferrari.\u201d", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-181319826.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
