Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) is hitting back at Hillary Clinton\u2019s suggestion that her presidential run is being boosted by Russia, lashing out against the former secretary of state as the \u201cpersonification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\u201d\n\nThe dust-up was spurred by a \u201cCampaign HQ\u201d podcast interview released Friday in which Clinton, without providing evidence, asserted that Russians have \u201ctheir eye on somebody who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate.\u201d\n\nThough Clinton did not name Gabbard, at the fourth Democratic debate in Ohio earlier this week, the congresswoman claimed on stage that The New York Times had called her a Russian asset when, in fact, it had recently reported that she is often discussed by Russia\u2019s state-run media.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the favorite of the Russians,\u201d said Clinton, who was the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee. \u201cThey have a bunch of sites and bots and ways of supporting her so far. And that\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she\u2019s also a Russian asset.\u201d\n\nStein later slammed Clinton\u2019s remarks on Twitter, writing that she was \u201cpeddling conspiracy theories to justify her failure instead of reflecting on real reasons Dems lost in 2016.\u201d\n\nIn a response of her own, Gabbard unleashed a torrent of criticism against Clinton, describing her as \u201cthe queen of warmongers\u201d and the \u201cembodiment of corruption,\u201d two attacks that have also been launched by President Donald Trump.\n\nGreat! Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain. From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a ... \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\n... powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly. \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\nGabbard, who is polling at 1% and has repeatedly claimed to be the victim of an unfair political system, alleged that \u201cthere has been a concerted campaign to destroy my reputation\u201d by Clinton and others \u201cafraid of the threat I pose.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me,\u201d Gabbard added. \u201cDon\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly.\u201d\n\nClinton has yet to publicly respond to those remarks.", "description": "She hit back at Clinton's suggestion that the Hawaii congresswoman is a Russian asset.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daa23f2210000371334a69b.jpeg?cache=vnrkvo7tqo&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
