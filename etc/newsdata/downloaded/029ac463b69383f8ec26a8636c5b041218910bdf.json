The ISIS news agency Amaq took little notice of al-Baghdadi\u2019s demise, while \u201cchatter\u201d in jihadi social media networks is reportedly subdued.\n\nReuters on Wednesday quoted analysts who argued the shock of losing Baghdadi was far worse for ISIS than the shock of losing Osama bin Laden was for al-Qaeda in 2011:\n\n\u201cThere is probably right now chaos inside what is left of the leadership. Key aides have been killed and documents destroyed,\u201d said Hisham al-Hashimi, an Iraqi expert on militant groups. \u201cThey will want to agree on a successor before announcing the death,\u201d he said, adding that a split of the group could delay this. The group might also need to rebrand itself since using Baghdadi\u2019s declared Islamic caliphate was no longer appropriate having lost the swathes of Iraq, Syria and Libya its fighters used to control until 2017, analysts said.\n\nOn the other hand, Reuters noted al-Qaeda needed a few days to acknowledge bin Laden\u2019s death and a few weeks to name a clear successor, so ISIS might be following a similar trajectory. The next issue of the ISIS weekly newsletter is due on Thursday, which might provide the terrorist organization with an opportunity to crown Baghdadi\u2019s successor.\n\nThe relatively subdued tone on jihadi social media is an interesting difference from bin Laden\u2019s death. A few ISIS supporters have tried denying Baghdadi is dead, or even dismissing his entire existence as a propaganda creation of sinister Western powers, but most settled for muttering that the fight will go on without him. One Reuters analysts suggested there are elements of the Islamic State that think Baghdadi did a poor job as leader and ISIS is better off without him.\n\nThe Islamic State\u2019s rivals in al-Qaeda, by contrast, seem openly delighted by Baghdadi\u2019s demise and have spent the past few days showering the ISIS splinter group with I-told-you-so messages and efforts to recruit them back into the al-Qaeda fold.\n\n\u201cHow much blood has been shed in the name of his imaginary caliphate?\u201d sneered one former official linked to al-Qaeda, his sick burn somewhat undermined by al-Qaeda\u2019s general comfort level with shedding blood.\n\nAl-Qaeda media reportedly put together a recruiting video urging ISIS devotees to accept Baghdadi\u2019s death as a \u201cglorious night in Muslim history\u201d and urging them to join the \u201ctrue jihad\u201d offered by al-Qaeda.\n\nImportant: #AlQaeda is capitalizing on #Baghdadi's death AQ wires are circulating new video by jihad ideologue #Muhaysini. Plan is to translate it into 10 languages. Calls Baghdadi's death \"a glorious night in Muslim history\".

Qardash is seen by analysts as a likely candidate for the post, but he had not been confirmed in that position as of Wednesday.\n\nThe Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) found some unofficial pro-ISIS media outlets urging followers not to believe reports of Baghdadi\u2019s death and await confirmation from official Islamic State media. Others informed ISIS true believers that \u201cmartyrdom\u201d is the highest goal of the jihadi, so if Baghdadi is dead, it only means he succeeded at his life\u2019s ambition.\n\n\u201cThe jihad will not stop when a certain person dies, even if he was the caliph himself,\u201d one leading ISIS media operative declared.\n\n\u201cWhat the impure Crusaders do not understand with regard to the Muslims\u2019 creed, especially that of the jihad fighters, is that jihad in its entirety is not founded on men, but on creed. The creed does not die with the death or killing of men,\u201d said a similar message in a pro-ISIS channel on the encrypted messaging service Telegram.\n\n\u201cIf Abu Bakr did attain martyrdom in the path of Allah, then he has achieved what he hoped for. Good for him! What a fine commander, worshiper, jihad fighter, pronouncer of monotheism he is!\u201d declared another Telegram message, anticipating that Allah the \u201cMerciful One\u201d will quickly appoint a new \u201ccommander like him for the Islamic State.\u201d", "description": "Official ISIS media have not yet acknowledged the death of \"caliph\" Abu Bakr al-Bagdadi, and chatter in jihadi social media is subdued.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1178435973-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
