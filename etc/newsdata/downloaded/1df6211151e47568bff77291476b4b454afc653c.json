Now, some analysts are growing bearish on the solar sector heading into year-end and into 2020.\n\nAs Benzinga reported Tuesday, GLJ Research's Gordon Johnson recently waxed bearish on the solar sector, Chinese stocks in particular.\n\nSee Also: Analyst: Dim Outlook For Solar Sector In 2020\n\nWhy It's Important\n\n\u201cIn short, based on our checks this morning in China, we believe weaker-than-expected module shipments are likely the reason for Longi's (large) 3Q19 earnings miss,\u201d Johnson said in a note out last week.\n\nWeakness in Chinese solar names is relevant to TAN, which tracks the MAC Global Solar Energy Index, because the $433 million ETF allocates nearly a quarter of its weight to Chinese stocks. That's the fund's second-largest geographic exposure behind the 47.30% devoted to American solar companies.\n\nMuch of the forecast weakness in Chinese solar stocks is focused on small-cap names, but that's still pertinent to TAN because the ETF's 22 holdings have an average market capitalization of $2.39 billion and nearly 23% of those names are classified as small-cap growth stocks. Another 35.70% are small-cap blend or value names.\n\nWhat's Next\n\nGLJ's Johnson said Chinese solar demand could disappoint next year, which is rough outlook because the country, desperate to reduce its pollution footprint, accounts for nearly half of global solar demand.\n\nWhile many American solar firms are not heavily reliant on China, erosion in the solar industry there could put some burden on U.S. solar names to pick up the slack. It's possible that could happen by way of ongoing corporate adoption of green energy solutions, but that may not be enough to stem a tide of 2020 sluggishness in Chinese solar equities.\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
