Trudeau needs support from other parties to govern, most likely the left-leaning New Democrats, who want aggressive cuts in carbon emissions cuts and greater urgency in fighting climate change.\n\n\u201cWith this being our first strike post election, we need numbers to show our government that we are unstoppable and a better world is possible!\u201d organisers Sustainabiliteens Vancouver wrote on their Facebook page.\n\nThe NDP are also opposed to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project, which would nearly triple the flow of crude from Alberta\u2019s oil sands to the Port of Vancouver for export to refineries abroad.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s government bought the pipeline in 2018 for C$4.5 billion to help it get built but the project in fiercely opposed by environmental and indigenous activists and has been delayed by repeated court challenges.\n\n\u201cClimate leaders do not build or invest in pipelines that not only stand to have devastating environmental repercussions but undermine Indigenous title and rights, Trudeau has taken a contrary path,\u201d said Kukpi7 Judy Wilson, Secretary-Treasurer of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs, which will be marching alongside Thunberg.\n\nProtestors will assemble in downtown Vancouver in the morning for a hour-long march through the city center followed by a rally. The protest will kick off with a news conference announcing legal action by fifteen young Canadians who are suing the federal government for violating their rights by knowingly contributing to climate change.\n\nLast week Thunberg addressed a rally in Edmonton, Alberta, the heart of Canada\u2019s energy industry, where she was met by a smaller counter-protest of oil and gas workers.\n\nCanada is the world\u2019s fourth largest oil and gas producer and Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government is trying to find a balance between taking steps to cut carbon emissions while also growing the country\u2019s energy industry, which contributes 11% of national gross domestic product.", "description": "Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg will address a rally in Vancouver, British Columbia, on Friday in the latest leg of her global campaign to spark action to tackle rising carbon emissions.", "authors": ["Jim Morris", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444942330&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O1K7", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
