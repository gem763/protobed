Those screenshots did not censor Yermak\u2019s phone number, essentially doxxing the Ukrainian official to Giuliani\u2019s followers.\n\nAt roughly 3:40PM ET, Giuliani told Fox News reporter John Roberts that his account had been locked, although he resumed tweeting shortly afterward. In accordance with Twitter policy, Giuliani\u2019s account would have remained locked until the offending tweet was removed.\n\nAn adviser to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, Yermak has found himself at the center of a growing scandal concerning Giuliani\u2019s efforts to dig up scandals on former Vice President Joe Biden. Last month, a whistleblower filed a complaint over concerns that Trump used his office\u2019s power to encourage Zelensky to investigate potential foreign dealings between Ukraine and 2020 Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden\u2019s family. The whistleblower\u2019s complaint repeatedly mentions both Attorney General Bill Barr and Giuliani. Ever since its disclosure, Giuliani has been filling his Twitter feed with text message screenshots with Ukrainian officials and himself in an attempt to deny any criminal actions.\n\nThe scandal has tested the limits of Twitter\u2019s rules on a number of occasions. Several Democratic presidential candidates have called on Twitter to ban President Trump in response to apparent calls for retaliation against the whistleblower. Thus far, Twitter has declined to take any action on the requests. More recently, the president ran afoul of the platform\u2019s intellectual property system, when one of Trump\u2019s tweets casting doubts on Biden\u2019s activities in Ukraine was removed for using an unlicensed Nickelback song.", "description": "A Twitter spokesperson told The Verge that Giuliani\u2019s tweets, which included screenshots of texts with Andriy Yermak, violated platform rules on posting private information", "authors": ["Makena Kelly", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v_jKvhRJzh5qtjtHYYM82HUyjsQ=/0x0:3500x1832/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19257508/1056815892.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
