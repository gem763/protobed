When we started to walk inside the jungle, we were a bit tense.\u201d\n\nIn true Tarzan style, Luiz was searching for gorillas. He was in Rwanda with his mother and his fianc\u00e9e, learning about a part of the world he knew little about, and the opportunity to see a family of wild silverbacks was one he embraced with typical gusto.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d he says, leaning back in his chair. \u201cWe found the family and there were more than 10 of them. Of course, for the first five minutes you are scared. But after that you see they are lovely, how they accept us. There was a baby who was just three days old.\u201d\n\nIt is, one assumes, safe to say that Luiz was the only Premier League footballer who could be found wading through an African jungle and cooing over a baby gorilla during the international break. But then the Brazilian has never been the conformist type, in his appearance or in his football, and his approach to the trip was as wholehearted as you would expect of a man who rarely does things by halves.\n\nInvited as part of Arsenal\u2019s partnership with Rwanda, Luiz chose to do it properly. He brought his family, serving as his mother\u2019s translator, and was far more involved in learning about the country\u2019s history \u2014 the genocide of 1994, and the rapid reconstruction of society since then \u2014 than anyone could have hoped of an elite footballer fulfilling his contractual obligations.", "description": "David Luiz, being David Luiz, does not hold back in his description of his recent adventure in a Rwandan rainforest.", "authors": ["Sam Dean", "Keith Hackett"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/20/arsenal-star-david-luiz-visits-mountain-gorillas-in-rwanda_48890232016_o-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq8JWdQZ1J_PyHeSO_SJ-VAqmM7PGrmz_msLjgavdLCgA.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
