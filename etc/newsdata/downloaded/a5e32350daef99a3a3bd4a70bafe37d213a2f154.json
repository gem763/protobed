They\u2019ve also bought the rights to the UK\u2019s premier soccer league, which is the biggest soccer league in the entire world. ... Live broadcast is the real big thing here. Having live Yankees games, live NFL, live soccer \u2014 they\u2019re really going in hard on this. It\u2019s a play on Disney as well since they own ESPN.\u201d\n\nGardner also thinks it\u2019s a win-win for the Yankees. \u201cThe people that own the highest stake [in YES] is the Yankees. They got a better deal out of this than Amazon. They own 26% of this now \u2014 of their own brand.\u201d\n\nSinclair will own 20%, Amazon 15%, with the right to purchase more, and the rest split among the deal's other investors, which includes RedBird Capital, The Blackstone Group and Mubadala Capital.\n\nAll Markets Summit 2019 More\n\nNick Monte is a producer at Yahoo Finance.\n\nMore from Nick:\n\nElon Musk should be like Bill Gates \u2013 but not in a good way\n\nGoogle, Microsoft could disrupt the entire video game industry\n\nApple\u2019s major headache is trying to find a substitute for China\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Amazon is stepping up to the plate to stream more sports content.
