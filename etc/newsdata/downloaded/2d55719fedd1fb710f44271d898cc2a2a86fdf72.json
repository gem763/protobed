(This story has since been debunked as baseless, though that has not prevented Trump, Giuliani, and other surrogates in conservative media from repeatedly pushing the story.)\u2026\n\nTrump\u2019s dangling of pardons to Manafort and others who might provide damaging testimony against the president to law enforcement agents, such as his former personal attorney Michael Cohen, have been widely reported, both by news media outlets and in the Mueller Report. According to the participant in the joint defense agreement discussions, Manafort was distressed at the uncertainty about whether President Trump would pardon him. There was no formal understanding that Trump would do so, because this would instantly have raised the specter of whether such a pardon might constitute an obstruction of justice.\n\nInstead, Manafort and those around him took the very public efforts by Giuliani to press Ukraine to investigate Manafort\u2019s accusers as a favorable signal that the president might still pardon him after the 2020 presidential election. Trump is famously transactional, and Manafort feared that the president might be leading him on, according to the person who was party to the joint defense agreement communications. Giuliani\u2019s constant touting of the Ukraine issue proved \u201creassuring\u201d to Manafort, albeit to \u201ca limited degree,\u201d according to this person.", "description": "", "authors": ["Murray Waas", "Nybooks.Com Daily Trump-Giuliani-And-Manafort-The-Ukraine-Scheme"], "top_image": ""}
