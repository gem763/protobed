He continued:\n\n\u201cA core element of national sovereignty is currency issuance; we would not leave that to private businesses.\u201d\n\nFrosty Libra welcome continues\n\nScholz\u2019s comments came at the same time as Apple CEO Steve Cook revealed his distaste for Libra, likewise claiming that governments and central banks should be in charge of money.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with the idea that a private entity can create a modern currency,\u201d he said in an interview with French publication Les Echos. He added that Apple would not attempt to replicate Facebook\u2019s currency experiment.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, Libra\u2019s latest roadmap suggests that its developers still have full faith in the project and intend to continue progress toward launching a mainnet.\n\nA rough release timeframe of Q2 2020 was circulating for several months before Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg conversely said that the company had no deadline for a launch.\n\nOn Oct. 4, payments network PayPal officially pulled out of the Libra Association.", "description": "Germany\u2019s finance minister Olaf Scholz said in an interview that he intends to keep money issuance under the state\u2019s control", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvYzc3NWFiYWExMjcyZDI0YzkzZmY5YWNjMGI1N2JlNjIuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
