I don\u2019t know what the kid could have done. It\u2019s excessive,\u201d Edwards said in a previous press conference also released on Facebook.\n\nAuthorities, however, are grateful for the speed with which the public reacted to the online video as they searched for Slocum.\n\n\u201cThe fact that so many people called in so rapidly, it was incredible,\u201d said Edwards. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have asked for a quicker response.\u201d", "description": "An Ohio man has been arrested after he was caught on surveillance footage whipping his 3-year-old son dozens of times with an extension cord.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/slocum1-ht-ml-191003_hpMain_v12x5_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
