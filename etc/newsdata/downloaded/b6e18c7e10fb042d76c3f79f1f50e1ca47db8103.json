Well, it\u2019s still an Android tablet. The Galaxy Tab S4 is the new flagship 10.5-inch tablet that Samsung is aiming toward people who want a device that\u2019s lighter than an ultrabook but still has a keyboard and pen.\n\nSamsung has done everything it can to transform the Galaxy Tab S4 into a \u201creal\u201d computer, even though it still runs Android 8.1. That strategy revolves around giving the Tab S4 a desktop-style environment with individual windows and improved multitasking called Samsung DeX.\n\nThe Tab S4\u2019s execution is layered\n\nBut turning an Android tablet into a hybrid doesn\u2019t come cheap \u2014 at least not by usual Android tablet standards. Pricing for the Wi-Fi version of the Tab S4 starts at $649, which includes the S Pen. However, the keyboard is an additional $149. That makes a complete setup $800, which is $10 less than a 10.5-inch iPad Pro with Apple\u2019s Smart Keyboard (minus the Apple Pencil).\n\nYou can also link a Bluetooth mouse if you already have one to complete the DeX experience. (And, as you\u2019ll see, you kind of need to.)\n\nOur review of Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 Verge Score 6.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Gorgeous screen\n\nExcellent battery life\n\nDeX is great for multitasking Bad Stuff Android apps for tablets are still mediocre\n\nRequires you to buy keyboard / mouse for Dex to be useful\n\nFace / iris scanning is hit or miss Buy for $649.00 from Samsung Buy for $649.00 from Amazon\n\nAesthetically, the Galaxy Tab S4 is a good example of straightforward industrial design for a tablet. It measures 7.1mm thin and weighs 482 grams (1.06 pounds) so it definitely passes as lightweight. It has a glass back and front, comes in white or black, and is well-balanced, no matter how you pick it up.\n\nSince it\u2019s mostly glass, the Tab S4 is a fingerprint magnet of the highest order. Once I wiped it off a few times, I realized Samsung still deserves credit: it\u2019s a unique and good-looking tablet without excessive branding.\n\nIf you take a look around the Tab S4, you\u2019ll notice the gold contacts on the edge of the long side (meant for the keyboard), a volume rocker, power button, microSD card slot, 3.5mm audio jack, and a USB-C fast charging port.\n\nThe one major takeaway I have from using the Galaxy Tab S4 hardware is how beautiful the screen is. It\u2019s a 10.5-inch, 2560 x 1600 sAMOLED display. (Yes, Samsung rebrands the tech its displays use.) Brightness can be cranked up to the max, and it still produces an image with tons of contrast and saturation without blacks looking washed out. The crisp image the Tab S4 produces means that it\u2019s highly suitable for photo retouching, drawing doodles, or watching the new season of Luke Cage.\n\nIf you\u2019re into heavy saturation and contrast on screens, this is it\n\nThe Tab S4 definitely has one of the best-looking tablet displays of the year, and it\u2019s not just because of Samsung\u2019s use of display tech and color balancing. The bezels on the sides have shrunk compared to last year\u2019s Galaxy Tab, so it\u2019s more visually striking and immersive to look at. However, if you appreciate more color-accurate screens, there\u2019s a chance you might not like the Tab S4\u2019s oversaturated color profile.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S4 specs 10.5-inch 2560 x 1600 sAMOLED display\n\nSnapdragon 835 octa-core chipset\n\n4GB RAM / 64GB storage / microSD up to 400GB\n\n7,300mAh battery\n\nAndroid 8.1 with Samsung Dex\n\nQuad speakers \u201ctuned by AKG\u201d\n\n13-megapixel main camera with flash / 8-megapixel front-facing camera\n\nS Pen\n\nOn its own, the Tab S4 is a powerful media-consumption device. But Samsung\u2019s real goal for this tablet is to make it a productivity device. The $149 keyboard doubles as a stand and case for the Tab S4, but you can\u2019t adjust the angle, so it only really works in one position.\n\nOn the left side of the keyboard, there\u2019s a removable S Pen holder, but it feels chintzy. It sometimes can accidentally snap off before you have to snap it back on again, and it\u2019s an odd place to cut corners.\n\nAnother oddity: there\u2019s no trackpad. So if you really want to take advantage of the DeX desktop mode, you\u2019ll need your own Bluetooth mouse, or you can use the S Pen as a mouse replacement, which is awkward.\n\nEverything but a trackpad\n\nIf there\u2019s a bright side, it\u2019s that typing feels decent. It doesn\u2019t have a lot of travel, but it isn\u2019t as shallow as the MacBook Pro\u2019s butterfly keyboard. However, the keys are incredibly small, and despite having young, nimble fingers, I often struggled to hit the backspace key quickly or get used to the even smaller number row. If you want to send dozens of emails with the Tab S4 keyboard every day, you should practice a lot to commit the layout to your muscle memory. Also, the keys aren\u2019t backlit, so using the Tab S4 keyboard at night is a crapshoot.\n\nTechnically, you have an emoji button\n\nOne pleasant surprise was Samsung\u2019s decision to include an on-screen keyboard button, which brings up a small version of the native full-screen Android keyboard when you\u2019re in DeX mode. It\u2019s helpful if you want to add emoji, type using your voice, and add GIFs or stickers.\n\nThe only included accessory, other than a charger, is the S Pen. This year, it\u2019s been redesigned for the Tab S4. Design-wise, it reminds me of a faux Montblanc pen, but Samsung prefers calling it \u201crefined.\u201d And it is! It\u2019s lightweight, balances in your fingertips like a real pen, and has a soft tip. It tracks very well and reminds me less of the Galaxy Note\u2019s S Pen and more like the Surface Pen, which is often used by artists for professional design work.\n\nOur resident talented artist and Circuit Breaker reporter Dami Lee drew a quick doodle and said it \u201cfelt better and more natural than an Apple Pencil.\u201d While you can\u2019t flip the pen over to use it as a digital eraser, it does support Samsung\u2019s Air Command features. You can annotate screenshots, write out notes, draw, sign documents, and do pretty much anything else a digital pen is meant for.\n\nThe new S Pen is great for artists\n\nDeX is Samsung\u2019s specialized software for giving Android a desktop interface, with windows, browser tabs, and a taskbar. On the Tab S4, it\u2019s available as just another mode, whereas on Samsung phones, you have to plug into a weird dock to enable it.\n\nSamsung DeX is going to be one of the Tab S4\u2019s biggest selling points and for good reason. It\u2019s amazing what Samsung has accomplished with Android here.\n\nYou can have a dozen Android apps open at a time in an environment where you can resize them as windows, move them around, go full-screen with just one, or have the option of projecting the whole thing on an external TV / monitor.\n\nIt\u2019s snappy, and that\u2019s good\n\nThere\u2019s still a downside: Android apps optimized for tablets are few and far between, and those that do exist definitely haven\u2019t been designed or optimized to run on the Tab S4 in DeX mode.\n\nPerformance-wise, I had some concerns about Samsung using an older Snapdragon 835 chipset with only 4GB of RAM, but I haven\u2019t come across crashes or lag at all. Overall performance doesn\u2019t become an issue until you hit a dozen apps running at the same time. At that point, I noticed resizing windows wasn\u2019t as snappy, but the Tab S4 still persisted and didn\u2019t crash.\n\nOf course, there are some holes in Samsung\u2019s execution of DeX. For example, you have to reopen all the apps you were working from when you switch between the Android and DeX interface, unless you enable the \u201cDeX Labs\u201d feature, which carries them over (but not always).\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that some Android apps, like Netflix or Pok\u00e9mon Go, don\u2019t seem to work with DeX. It can\u2019t run them full-screen even if you enable a DeX Labs feature that forces non-supported apps to resize. Still, most Android apps should play nice \u2014 hopefully.\n\nSamsung Dex doesn\u2019t play well with every app\n\nThe most unusual peripheral for an Android tablet is probably a Bluetooth mouse. DeX makes good use of a mouse because you can right click on apps in the taskbar to close them or otherwise access options that would usually be hidden with a long press. What\u2019s unusual is that a mouse is really necessary to make the most of DeX, which makes the whole thing feel a little less portable.\n\nIs using the Tab S4 in default Android tablet mode worth it? Only if you can\u2019t use the app in DeX mode or if you don\u2019t have a keyboard. Otherwise, there\u2019s really no reason to use it like you would most Android tablets. Screen real estate isn\u2019t utilized as efficiently, so DeX is the only point where the Tab S4\u2019s software really shines.\n\nFor those of you wondering about Bixby, Samsung\u2019s often-delayed virtual assistant: it\u2019s delayed. Samsung says Bixby should launch for the Tab S4 next year.\n\nThe Tab S4 has great cameras on the front and back. (I\u2019ll save what I think about taking pictures on a tablet for another time.) The main 13-megapixel camera can shoot 4K up to 30 fps, while the front-facing supports up to 1080p HD.\n\nOn the front, the Tab S4 also houses the sensors for its iris and face scanner unlocking feature. These are hit or miss because the Tab S4 doesn\u2019t always \u201csee\u201d my face if I\u2019m using it with the keyboard and the desk I\u2019m at is too low. However, it does sometimes work in pitch black darkness, so that\u2019s kind of nice.\n\nFace unlocking is hit or miss\n\nMost of the Tab S4\u2019s weight comes from the massive 7,300mAh battery. Samsung advertises 16 hours of battery life using the Tab S4 for video and productivity. That\u2019s not far off: I got around 15 hours of use before hitting critical battery levels by binge-watching on Netflix and writing out the occasional Slack message or email with the keyboard. If you use the Tab S4 conservatively (no GPS, Bluetooth, and 50 percent brightness) it shouldn\u2019t be difficult to hit the 16-hour mark.\n\nIt\u2019s missing things that you have to buy\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 is a great effort to make the ideal Android tablet. Samsung DeX makes the Tab S4 truly special, but the lack of optimized apps for Android and DeX modes means your software choices are quite limited. Samsung did a remarkable job of making the Tab S4 seem like it\u2019s more than the sum of its parts. I just wish the parts were better.\n\nPhotography by Stefan Etienne / The Verge", "description": "The flagship Galaxy Tab S4 is Samsung\u2019s attempt at making a tablet that tries to be a laptop.
