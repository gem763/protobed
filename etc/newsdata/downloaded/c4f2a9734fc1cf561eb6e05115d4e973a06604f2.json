I didn't see it coming. I remember not understanding. What the hell does streaming mean? They're like, it's there all the time,' she said.\n\nThe change in plot called for a change in showrunner, ultimately ousting writer and first-time showrunner Jay Carson.\n\nInstead the show hired on Kerry Ehrin of Bates Motel in April 2018.\n\nAs well as serving as the leading characters in the show, Jennifer and Reese also produced the forthcoming Apple drama (pictured together on set in NYC in May)\n\nThe Morning Show follows journalists Karen, Mitch (Steve) and Bradley's (Reese) struggle to stay relevant in the changing landscape of media\n\nAniston plays Alex Levy, the anchor of a morning news show who fights to retain her job while locked in a rivalry with Witherspoon's character Bradley Jackson\n\nApple is offering their plan for nine original shows for $5-a-month, which is far less than its competitors.\n\nWedbush estimates that Apple could attract 100 million TV+ subscribers by 2023 and generate between $7 billion and $10 billion in revenue from the product, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nAniston said in an interview: 'It wasn't until the last couple of years when these streaming services were just sort of exploding with this amount of quality that I actually started to think, wow, that's better than what I just did.\n\n'And then you're seeing what's available out there and it's just diminishing and diminishing in terms of, it's big Marvel movies. Or things that I'm not just asked to do or really that interested in living in a green screen.'\n\nAniston, 50, also told how she could relate to the 'vulnerable' character she plays in her new series and sometimes has days where she doesn't want to 'go out of the house'.\n\nThe series - set for release November 1 - secured a straight-to-series, two-season order as Apple makes an entry into the scripted series arena\n\nSpeaking to The Telegraph about her latest role, Aniston said: 'I wanted to feel vulnerable. I wanted to show the raw, the messy, the unflattering. This is a woman holding it together.\n\n'One of the challenges for [my] character is the trauma and turmoil going on in her private life, and the toll that that takes on her emotionally, physically, mentally, versus the character that she is when she has to get up, put on a face and smile to America.'\n\nShe said: 'I can relate to that. Of course there are times when you don\u2019t want anyone to see you, or you don\u2019t want to be photographed or even go out of the house.'\n\nThe series also stars Steve Carell who plays Mitch Kessler, Alex's co-host who is fired from his job amidst a sexual misconduct scandal.\n\nThe first three episodes of The Morning Show will be available on Apple TV+ from November 1.", "description": "The show itself costs $15million an episode totally $300million for both seasons, mostly due to the big paycheck Witherspoon and Aniston negotiated.", "authors": ["Kayla Brantley For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/18/19753076-0-image-a-41_1571161179999.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
