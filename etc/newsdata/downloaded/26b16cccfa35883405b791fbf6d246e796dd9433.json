Premium Bonds started in 1957, with numbers drawn at random by National Saving & Investments Ernie machine.\n\nThe winner from Essex is something of a rarity in that his winning Bond was an old one.\n\nEarlier this year, This is Money worked out that between March and June just 5 per cent of winning numbers awarded prizes of at least \u00a310,000 were bought before the turn of the century, with 79 per cent bought between 2010 and 2019.\n\nThis is because more than three quarters of all 80.6 billion Premium Bonds have been bought since 2010, while just 4.3 per cent are older than 2000.\n\nThe two winners would have been handed the good news by Agent Million yesterday, as today is the first working day of October.\n\nThis means the two October millionaires would have been told of their success while it was still September, because of the way NS&I works.\n\nPremium Bonds Winners Prize Area Value of bond \u00a31,000,000 Dorset \u00a335,000 \u00a31,000,000 Essex \u00a32,000 \u00a3100,000 Cambridgeshire \u00a325 \u00a3100,000 Overseas \u00a335,000 \u00a3100,000 East Sussex \u00a320,000 \u00a3100,000 Inner London \u00a36,285 \u00a3100,000 Outer London \u00a35,000 \u00a3100,000 Lincolnshire \u00a35,000 More October 2019 winners View list of October 2019 winners\n\nIn total, more than 22million savers have money in Premium Bonds, making them Britain's best-loved savings product.\n\nAside from the two jackpot winners, almost 3.3million prizes were handed out in October worth \u00a396.9million. Of them, 99 savers won prizes of \u00a310,000 or more, with one saver from Cambridgeshire winning \u00a3100,000 on a \u00a325 Bond bought last March.\n\nOne person from Bridgend meanwhile won \u00a350,000 on a \u00a3100 Bond, and a holding of just \u00a3865 in total. This represents a return of just over 57 per cent, with the average interest rate on NS&I's savings products being 1.4 per cent.\n\nYou can check to see if your number's up with This is Money's Premium Bond prize checker, use NS&I's app or, if you own one you can even now ask Amazon's Alexa smart speaker.", "description": "The man, who bought \u00a34,000 in Premium Bonds in 1999, was one of the two people receiving a visit from Agent Million to tell them they had won October's top prize.", "authors": ["George Nixon For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
