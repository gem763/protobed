REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon\n\nSentiment of non-manufacturers also deteriorated with some retailers voicing concern over the potential impact of a sales tax hike kicking off on Oct. 1, the Bank of Japan\u2019s closely watched \u201ctankan\u201d survey showed on Tuesday.\n\nThe weak readings will keep the central bank under pressure to extend more monetary support for a fragile economy when its board meets for a rate review on Oct. 30-31.\n\nBut some analysts said business sentiment did not worsen as much as expected and capital expenditure was holding up, which may give the BOJ some breathing space in tapping its dwindling policy tool-kit.\n\n\u201cThe outcome wasn\u2019t as weak as feared,\u201d said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. \u201cThe economy is showing signs of slowdown but not falling off a cliff.\u201d\n\n\u201cCapital expenditure is also firm. I don\u2019t think today\u2019s data is gloomy enough to further heighten market expectations of near-term monetary easing.\u201d\n\nThe headline index for big manufacturers\u2019 sentiment stood at plus 5 in September, worsening 2 points from three months earlier but beating market forecasts for plus 2.\n\nIt marked the third straight quarter of decline and hit the lowest reading since June 2013 - two months after BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda deployed his \u201cbazooka\u201d monetary stimulus.\n\nThe big non-manufacturers\u2019 sentiment index stood at plus 21, worsening from plus 23 in June and roughly matching a median market forecast for plus 20.\n\nWORRY ON CONSUMPTION\n\nBoth big manufacturers and non-manufacturers expect sentiment to worsen in October-December, as overseas growth shows little sign of pick-up and the domestic sales tax hike seen hurting household spending.\n\nRetailers, restaurants and other service-sector firms saw sentiment deteriorate as they are more sensitive to any downturn in consumption from the higher levy, a BOJ official told reporters at a briefing on the tankan.\n\nThe survey also showed big firms plan to raise their capital expenditure by 6.6% in the financial year that ends March 2020, versus economists\u2019 median estimate of a 5.5% increase.\n\nCapital expenditure has been among the few bright spots in Japan\u2019s economy as non-manufacturers continue to invest heavily on automation to cope with a tight labor market, offsetting the weakness in manufacturers\u2019 spending.\n\n\u201cCapital expenditure is holding relatively firm, backed by non-manufacturers\u2019 spending. But an expected delay in the global recovery and the tax hike pain may prod firms to delay spending plans,\u201d said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s results will be neutral to the BOJ\u2019s policy stance. I still think there\u2019s a 50-50 chance for the BOJ to ease further at the next policy review this month, depending on yen\u2019s move,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the BOJ kept policy steady in September, it signaled the chance of expanding stimulus as early as this month by issuing a stronger warning against overseas risks.\n\nThe tankan\u2019s sentiment indexes are derived by subtracting the number of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good.
