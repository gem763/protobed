That prompted a confession from De Niro to his co-star:\n\nI said, \u201cThis is a great reaction, but it would be nice if they were here for a movie that we really feel proud about. Next time we\u2019ll do one we like.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 2019. Their next collaboration, director Martin Scorsese\u2019s long-awaited gangster epic \u201cThe Irishman,\u201d is receiving very good early reviews.\n\nSo we figure that their new Netflix film, to open in November, combined with \u201cHeat\u201d (1995) and \u201cThe Godfather: Part II\u201d (1974) gives them a .750 batting average.\n\nThat\u2019s worthy of the Hall of Fame.\n\nRobert De Niro Regrets 1 Movie He Made With 'Irishman' Co-star Al Pacino More\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nTheatergoer Holds Up 'Trump 2020' Flag At Robert De Niro's 'Bronx Tale'\n\nRobert De Niro Joins Former Prosecutors For Scathing Mueller Report Explainer\n\nRobert De Niro Doubles Down On 'F**k Trump' Speech, Hits Back At Critics\n\nLove HuffPost?
