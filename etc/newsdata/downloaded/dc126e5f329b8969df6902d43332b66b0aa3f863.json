It's still early days but they are talking and fans may be in for a treat in 2020. It all makes perfect sense for a reunion celebrating 20 years of S Club 7.\"\n\nThe band, famous for hits Reach and Never Had A Dream Come True, were formed by Simon Fuller in 1998.\n\nThe music manager once said he came up with the concept for the band the day after he was fired by the Spice Girls in 1997.\n\nThey first rose to fame with their children's TV show Miami 7 and went on to top the charts in the UK.\n\n(Image: Press Association)\n\nPaul quit the band in 2002, saying it was time for him to \"move on\", and the band split a year later.\n\nSince then, some members have continued to perform together as S Club 3 or S Club Party.\n\nBut now, they could all reunite on stage for the first time in years.\n\nRachel has hinted at a reunion before.\n\n(Image: Wenn)\n\nSpeaking on This Morning earlier this year, she said: \"You never know. There\u2019s seven of us all in different stages of our lives but it does bubble up every now and then.\n\n\"I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been 20 years, it\u2019s crazy. We were all over the place. TV shows, albums, touring.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
