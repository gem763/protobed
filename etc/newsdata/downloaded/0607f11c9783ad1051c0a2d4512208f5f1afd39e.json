I also feel like after you've told a story for two years, 18 months, it would be remiss to gallop through the end, actually.\n\n\"I think we're a bit immune to the realities [of death] and a bit scared of looking at it.\"\n\nSinead manages to forgive Daniel after discovering he kissed Bethany and hugs him tight in bed as they consider their lost future, telling him that she would have liked to have had four boys with him and live in a thatched cottage.\n\nVicar Billy visits her and she hands him a note with all of her funeral plans written on it and the pair become involved in a discussion about the afterlife, and whether there is one at all.\n\nSinead's family later visit her while she is gravely ill, with her mum in tears as she apologises for being a \"bad mother\".\n\nRealising that she is in her last hours, Sinead asks her family to leave and return in the morning - knowing that she won't see them again.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nAlone with Daniel again, she makes him promise not to go off the rails for Bertie's sake. She then begins telling him to bathe Bertie properly and not using a flannel, which Daniel admits he is scared about getting wrong.\n\nHowever he agrees and when Daniel reads Bertie a bedtime story, Sinead dies quietly.\n\nThe final powerful scene of the episodes show Daniel returning home after taking a walk with his son, following his wife's death, and standing in their apartment alone.\n\nHe manages to pull himself together and takes his son for a bath.\n\nSpeaking about whether Daniel would change in the aftermath of Sinead's death, actor Rob said: \"He's got the baby to focus on, but in terms of himself there won't be any, because that's the next stage of the story.\n\n\"She's told him all these things and that he needs to forgive himself and all of that but it's all been caught up in the death.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"He has to now unpick all of that and take all the meaning and the messages from what she was saying to him and actually apply them.\n\n\"But the trauma and the shock of it, you kind of get away from that as quickly as possible. So there will be, but it will take a bit of time to implement it.\"\n\nAfter watching the episodes for the first time, actress Katie said that it was like seeing a loved one die.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"It is sad because we've developed the character for six and a half years and I feel like I know her and she's gone now,\" she said. \"So watching her final days - it doesn't feel like I'm watching myself, it feels like I'm watching her.\n\n\"It's really sad, I feel like someone's died.\"\n\n*Sinead's final scenes air on Coronation Street for half an hour on Thursday 24 October and Friday 25 October for an hour", "description": "Katie McGlynn's character will die next week in upsetting realistic scenes", "authors": ["Rose Hill", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20579398.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EMB-25_10_coro_sinead_bed_1st_ep.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
