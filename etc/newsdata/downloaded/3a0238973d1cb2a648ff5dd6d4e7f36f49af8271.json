RIP Deborah.\"\n\nComedian and writer Shappi Khorsandi noted how there were \"so many beautiful tributes to Deborah Orr\" on her Twitter timeline on Monday, calling it \"a huge loss to journalism, to writing\".\n\n\"I read so much of her work over the years... Her always fiercely intelligent point of view,\" she added.\n\nOrr went on to work for Independent in 1999, before returning to The Guardian as a columnist for almost a decade.\n\nShe also agreed a deal to publish her first book - a memoir, which is due out next year. Writer John Niven was given an early copy and predicted it will be \"a huge hit\".\n\nSkip Twitter post by @estellecostanza Deborah Orr was kind enough to send me a copy of her memoir a few weeks back. Heartbreaking tonight to look at this photo of her as a wee girl. Even more heartbreaking that she didn\u2019t live to see it become the huge hit it will be in January. pic.twitter.com/nrEGiYBvCK \u2014 John Niven HQ (@estellecostanza) October 20, 2019 Report\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.
