Parents were frantic, with everyone seeming to know a family with a sick child.\n\nIn April, the disease was pinned down and the diagnosis was devastating: The city was the epicenter of an HIV outbreak that overwhelmingly affected children. Health officials initially blamed the outbreak on a single pediatrician, saying he was reusing syringes.\n\nSince then, about 1,100 citizens have tested positive for the virus, or one in every 200 residents. Almost 900 are younger than 12. Health officials believe the real numbers are probably much higher, as only a fraction of the population has been tested so far.\n\nGulbahar Shaikh, the local journalist who broke the news of the epidemic to residents of his city and the nation in April, watched as his neighbors and relatives rushed to clinics to line up and test for the virus.\n\nWhen officials descended on Ratodero to investigate, they discovered that many of the infected children had gone to the same pediatrician, Muzaffar Ghanghro, who served the city\u2019s poorest families and appeared to be at the center of the outbreak.\n\nShaikh panicked \u2014 that was his children\u2019s pediatrician. He rushed his family to be tested, and his 2-year-old daughter was confirmed to have the virus, which is the cause of AIDS.\n\n\u201cIt was devastating,\u201d said Shaikh, a 44-year-old television journalist in Ratodero, a city of 200,000 whose residents are some of Pakistan\u2019s poorest, with high illiteracy rates.\n\nGhanghro was the cheapest option in this city, charging 20 cents a visit for the many parents here who earn less than $60 a month.\n\nThe pediatrician treated all six of Imtiaz Jalbani\u2019s children, four of whom contracted HIV. His two youngest, 14-month-old Rida and 3-year-old Sameena, have died.\n\nA pediatrician works with patients in Ratodero, Pakistan, Oct. 23, 2019. (Mustafa Hussain/The New York Times) More\n\nJalbani, a laborer, said he first grew alarmed when he saw Ghanghro rummage through the trash for a syringe to use on Ali, his 6-year-old son, who is also infected. When Jalbani protested, he said, Ghanghro snapped at him and told him he was using an old syringe because Jalbani was too poor to pay for a new one.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018If you don\u2019t want my treatment, go to another doctor,\u2019\u201d Jalbani said. \u201cMy wife and I had to starve ourselves to pay for the medicine.\u201d\n\nGhanghro was arrested and charged by the police with negligence, manslaughter and causing unintentional harm. But he has not yet been convicted, and in an interview with The New York Times, he insisted he is innocent and has never reused syringes.\n\nThe doctor recently renewed his medical certificate and now works as a general practitioner at a government hospital on the outskirts of Ratodero, despite laws that make the reuse of syringes an offense that is not eligible for bail.\n\nHealth officials now say that Ghanghro is unlikely to be the sole cause of the outbreak. Visiting health workers saw many cases of doctors reusing syringes and IV needles. Barbers take the same razor to the faces of multiple customers, they said, and roadside dentists crack away at patients\u2019 teeth on sidewalks with unsterilized tools.\n\nSuch unhygienic practices are prevalent across Pakistan and probably the leading cause of the country\u2019s surging rates of HIV infection, according to health officials. But Ratodero is so poor that such practices are likely to be much more common, as residents struggle to make ends meet and scrimp wherever they can.", "description": "RATODERO, Pakistan -- Nearly 900 children in the small Pakistani city of Ratodero were bedridden early this year with raging fevers that resisted treatment.
