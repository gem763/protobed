Shares\n\nThe people have the right to abolish tyrannies When I was chairman of the terrorism subcommittee, I wanted to have Madame Rajavi testify [by satellite]. All the bureaucrats were jumping out the windows. They said it couldn't be done, but she made the case for freedom, the case for the MEK, the case for delisting the MEK. And let me say this about Madame Rajavi. When she testified and made the case for freedom for Iran, I was impressed and others were impressed. Shares\n\nTo the oppressors: 'Your days are numbered' ... And Madame (Rajavi), thank you, God bless you, God bless this movement. This movement will make it a better world....

We've seen since last year the people of Iran defying the regime's crackdown to rise up against the theocracy across Iran as a first step towards freedom. Your Iranian opposition, you, the MEK, are clearly behind these ongoing protests that continue to grow... Shares\n\nMaryam Rajavi: 'We will take back Iran' My fellow compatriots, honorable guests and distinguished dignitaries, Ashraf 3 welcomes you all. Shares\n\nBeautiful Ashraf 3 showcases Iran's future Nestled between the turquoise water of the Adriatic Sea and the Albanian Alps are pristine green spaces and valleys.

It was hardly part of my brief that there was such a thing as Ashraf. Shares\n\n'We stand with the people of MEK in Albania' for their freedom The international community must recognize the rights of Iranian people and resistance to establish freedom and democracy in their homeland, Iran. Ashraf 3 is a symbol for freedom and future. Shares\n\n'Ashraf 3 will forever be a historic city' Madame Rajavi and friends from Ashraf, a dream has come true. We are very honored to be here and to see this miracle, this overwhelming experience coming into a historic city that looks like Rome or Athens, which took thousands of years to build.

Massoud Rajavi has rightly called Ashraf the capital of the MEK, and I want to use this opportunity to express my warmest greetings to him, the historical leader of the MEK, and to wish him well because a free Iran will need him very much. Shares\n\n'You are part of living history' You're really organized.
