For them to tell me to race without my hijab, it\u2019s them telling me not to race at all\u2019 Abukaram told Huffington Post.\n\n\u2018And I\u2019m sure that applies for a lot of other people that feel strongly about their religion\u2019, she added.\n\nNoor Alexandria Abukaram has never been penalised for wearing a hijab before (Picture: HuffPost)\n\nAbukaram was told she needed to have a waiver signed by the Ohio High School Athletic Association in order to race wirth her hijab on, the HuffPost reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOhio\u2019s High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) state in their rule book that head coverings, such as hats and caps, were banned, but it does not address hijabs specifically.\n\nAbukaram claims another girl in her team was told to change before the race because she was wearing the wrong shorts, but no one has ever mentioned her needing a waiver for a hijab in all the years she has been competing.\n\nShe said: \u2018Anybody who wears hijab \u2014 or anyone who has to wear something for their religion \u2014 shouldn\u2019t have to get a waiver to race or not race at all.\n\n\u2018Why wouldn\u2019t they tell me about my uniform violation just like they told the girl on my team? Why wouldn\u2019t they give me that same respect that they gave her?\n\n\u2018I felt disrespected. I felt humiliated.\u2019\n\nShe was left feeling humiliated after the disqualification (Picture: HuffPost)\n\nAn OHSAA representative told HuffPost that cross-country runners are allowed to participate in competitions wearing religious headgear as long as they have \u2018obtained a waiver from the OHSAA and submitted it to the head office before the race since it is a change to the OHSAA uniform regulations.\u2019\n\nThey said Saturday\u2019s officials were simply enforcing this rule but said they would look at modifying it in the future.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
