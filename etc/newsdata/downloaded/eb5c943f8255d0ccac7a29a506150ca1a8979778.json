Bishops now have latitude to focus on the more inclusive parts of the church\u2019s catechism on homosexuals, such as the call to accept them with \u201crespect, compassion and sensitivity.\u201d They can follow the principle of accompaniment, meaning they can meet people where they are spiritually and build relationships that help them deepen their faith.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of a dialogue,\u201d said Francis DeBernardo, the executive director of New Ways Ministry, a group that ministers to and is an advocate for gay Catholics. \u201cThe church leadership, for the past 40 years, has just been so silent, and unwilling to dialogue, and unwilling to pray with L.G.B.T. Catholics that, even though this isn\u2019t the ultimate step, it\u2019s a first step,\u201d he said of Cardinal Tobin\u2019s welcome.\n\nSome church conservatives were wary, however. The problem, they said, was not the idea of welcoming \u2014 after all, Jesus welcomed all \u2014 but that the public embrace of such a group could be interpreted as the church\u2019s acceptance of a homosexual lifestyle, which church teaching bans.\n\n\u201cEveryone is welcome in the church, but no one is accepted as they are,\u201d said the Rev. Robert Gahl, a professor of ethics at Opus Dei\u2019s Pontifical University of the Holy Cross in Rome. \u201cWhile I am delighted that they went to Mass in the cathedral, I hope that Cardinal Tobin challenged them, as all good shepherds should, to live according to the teachings of Jesus.\u201d\n\nBut Cardinal Tobin said in an interview last week that to combine his welcome with a criticism would not have been a full welcome at all.\n\n\u201cThat sounds a little backhanded to me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was appropriate to welcome people to come and pray and call them who they were. And later on, we can talk.\u201d\n\nShowing just how sensitive the simple act of welcome could be, he said that after the Mass he had received a fair amount of visceral hate mail from fellow Catholics. Someone was even organizing a letter-writing campaign to call on other bishops to correct him.", "description": "Cardinal Joseph W.
