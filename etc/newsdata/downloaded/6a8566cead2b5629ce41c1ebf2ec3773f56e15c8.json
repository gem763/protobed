Magers had sued the Alabama clinic where he believed his ex-girlfriend obtained the abortion pill, on behalf of himself and the estate of the aborted embryo.\n\nThe Alabama case, which attempted to vest the embryo with legal rights, drew national attention in March after a probate judge allowed Magers to open a legal estate for the aborted embryo called \u201cBaby Roe\u201d in court filings. In seeking to open the estate, Magers pointed to a newly approved state constitutional amendment that says Alabama recognizes the \u201crights of unborn children.\u201d The probate judge\u2019s decision allowed Magers to represent the estate of the aborted embryo in the litigation.\n\nIn the brief order, Comer wrote that Magers didn\u2019t assert the defendants were engaged in unlawful conduct and the wrongful death claims are \u201cprecluded by existing state and federal laws pertaining to the conduct in question.\u201d\n\nThe ruling says that although Magers placed \u201cgreat significance to the probate court\u2019s\u201d decision, Judge Comer found the probate court\u2019s process \u201cto be ministerial in nature.\u201d The phrase means it follows a prescribed procedure.\n\nJ. Brent Helms, an attorney representing Magers, said they had anticipated the decision.\n\n\u201cWe expected it would be dismissed at the trial court level. We knew we had to get to the appellate court level before we\u2019d get traction,\u201d Helms wrote in an email. He said Magers is weighing whether to appeal.\n\nMagers and his then-girlfriend were both teenagers when she got pregnant in 2017, according to the lawsuit. Magers said the young woman had an abortion when she was about six weeks pregnant.\n\nThe clinic had asked for the case to be dismissed. A lawyer for the clinic told the judge during a July hearing that there was no wrongful death because abortion is legal.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to say the judge ruled Friday, not Monday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An Alabama judge has dismissed a wrongful death lawsuit filed on behalf on an aborted embryo by a man who was upset that his ex-girlfriend ended her pregnancy.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kim Chandler"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2018/12/04/124_2018_beltway-gavel8201_c0-22-1000-605_s1770x1032.jpg?6baa7fc9753974cea7d7b61357d3b811ea91649d"}
