On Friday, at least 70 people were killed when a mosque in Nangarhar province was bombed.\n\n\u2013 Delayed election results \u2013\n\nWhen asked how the EU, which has only a limited footprint in Afghanistan, could leverage a truce, Kobia suggested that the Taliban might return to power in \u201cone form or another\u201d within months and so would entertain a truce to help normalise future relations with the European bloc.\n\n\u201cA ceasefire would be a token, a guarantee of goodwill and good preparation for the normalisation of these relationships,\u201d Kobia said.\n\nThe Taliban have steadfastly ruled out an immediate ceasefire, but last year downed weapons for a three-day truce.\n\nAfghanistan is currently in an uneasy waiting period following the first round of presidential elections on September 28.\n\nResults were supposed to be released Saturday but have been indefinitely delayed due to \u201ctechnical issues\u201d, the Independent Election Commission said.\n\nPierre Mayaudon, head of the EU delegation in Afghanistan, said a delay of a few days to finalise results was legitimate to ensure votes were fairly counted.\n\n\u201cBut not many more days that again will go into weeks and will possibly raise the perception that something is happening,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u2013 Surprise US visits \u2013\n\nUS Defense Secretary Mark Esper meanwhile arrived in Kabul on Sunday on an unannounced visit to meet with US troops and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking\u2026 to get a really good feel for what\u2019s happening on the ground in Afghanistan, and to talk what the way ahead may look like as well,\u201d Esper told reporters accompanying him, according to a Pentagon transcript.\n\n\u201cWe think a political agreement is always the best way forward with regard to next steps in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the United States has around 14,000 troops in Afghanistan.\n\nEsper said that footprint could shrink to about 8,600 with no impact on counterterrorism operations against groups such as the Afghan affiliate of the Islamic State group.\n\nTop US Democrat Nancy Pelosi, who is leading an impeachment probe into Trump, also made an unannounced visit to Afghanistan on Sunday as part of a bipartisan congressional delegation.\n\nPelosi, who has been bitterly critical of Trump\u2019s foreign policy, met with Ghani as well as US troops and diplomats.\n\nSince Trump ended talks with the Taliban, Zalmay Khalilzad, the US special envoy leading the negotiations, has spoken informally with insurgents in Pakistan, raising the possibility that Washington is seeking to resume discussions.", "description": "Kabul (AFP) \u2013 European Union officials called Sunday for a ceasefire in Afghanistan, saying the breakdown in US-Taliban talks presented an", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/ccb469_eu-has-called-ceasefire-in-afghanistan-as-violence-in-country-continues-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
