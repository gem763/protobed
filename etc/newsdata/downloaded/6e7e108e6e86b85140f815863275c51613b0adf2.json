Edwina Pickles\n\nEarlier this year, National Australia Bank's executive in charge of technology and cloud infrastructure Steve Day told The Australian Financial Review Innovation Summit that it is now more comfortable storing its banking applications inside data centres managed by Google, Microsoft and Amazon than using its own facilities.\n\n\"We engaged APRA around 2015, which was when we started our digital platforms migration to AWS,\" Mr Mills said. \"And then since then we've kept in regular contact and given them updates.\"\n\nSecurity fears assuaged\n\nAmong the services NIB has added since it started using AWS is its Nibby customer service chatbot, which was built using AWS's Lex machine learning interface. It has been credited with relieving pressure on frontline employees by performing tasks like sorting calls and responding with information, while also assisting with sales enquiries.\n\nPaul Migliorini, AWS' Australia and New Zealand managing director, said its ability to convince the Australian Cyber Security Centre to certify its facilities to a \"protected\" level late last year meant that government and corporate clients were increasingly able to demonstrate that they were meeting compliance requirements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The fact that APRA are comfortable with NIB moving a system of record says that they are confident in the security ... security is job zero for us,\" he said.\n\n\"We see customers the world over looking to move faster and innovate in more compelling ways, and we think NIB is one of the really leading examples in Australia and New Zealand of progressive companies in this regard.\"\n\nNIB engages Australian technology services company CMD solutions to assist in its cloud transition. Its chief technology officer Adam Durbin said he had been working with APRA for over four years to discuss the operations of three different clients.\n\nHe said the regulator has become increasingly comfortable with cloud use as organisations have become more mature in the way they look at adopting it.\n\n\"It's about how they use automation, security and cloud-native services to enhance their environment,\" Mr Durbin said.", "description": "The private health insurer has moved one of its divisions on to Amazon Web Services, and is going all-in in the hunt for efficiency and smarter systems.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/85831240f80b499586da170a94fd18a8da70b2a0", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
