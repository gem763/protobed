Instagram made her a star.", "language": "en", "text": "And it\u2019s no longer in the background.\n\n\n\nTouring as a backup dancer for an artist like Jackson or Justin Bieber used to be a commercial dancer\u2019s dream. Now, that kind of work is a steppingstone to an even bigger prize: a robust social media account.\n\nDancers who break through on Instagram, YouTube and TikTok, the relatively new app for short videos, can reap personal, artistic and financial rewards far beyond the paychecks for executing someone else\u2019s moves and pounding the stage behind a pop star. Internet popularity can be a dancer\u2019s entree to choreographing and starring in her own viral videos, traveling the world as a guest artist and teacher, and inking lucrative brand deals and endorsements.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt used to be that your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was a sheet of paper that you would hand in at auditions,\u201d says Hatala, who specializes in hip-hop and is known as @tayd_dance on Instagram. \u201cNow it\u2019s our social media. My Instagram is my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and my Twitter is my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. . . . People say, \u2018We saw your Instagram and this is why we wanted you.\u2019 \u201d\n\nUnlike many dance influencers, who live in this sunny mecca of production studios and agents, Hatala\u2019s home is Edmonton, Alberta, in Western Canada, with her parents and younger sister, Reese, a dancer who also has a growing social media following. Of course, an Instagrammer needs little more than the camera on her phone and some clear floor space to record her videos, so location doesn\u2019t matter much. Still, Hatala comes home from school a couple of times a month to hear her mom announce that they\u2019re off to Los Angeles, right away, for a job.\n\n\n\nShe was here recently to shoot a promo for the Netflix movie \u201cTall Girl.\u201d Hatala and her mother, Teresa, stopped in at a North Hollywood dance studio early one morning for an interview and a hip-hop-animation demo before heading to the airport. Tall and willowy, Hatala is a powerful dancer with a refined quality, every move beautifully clear, whether it\u2019s a sharp pop or the flutter of an arm like a breath of wind.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen she speaks, she\u2019s disarmingly open. There isn\u2019t much about her world that she hasn\u2019t analyzed.\n\nHer life is \u201cchaotic,\u201d she says, and she loves it. But like most dancers, Hatala is a perfectionist. This puts her in a bind with the ethos of her era.\n\n\u201cSometimes I stress out about it because in our generation, if something doesn\u2019t interest you in the first two seconds, you scroll past it,\u201d she says. \u201cI have a constant battle with it, because everything I put out I want to be perfect. I want to be proud of it.\n\n\u201cBut at the same time, personally, I appreciate dancers who are raw over their social media. And it\u2019s important to me to still show my fans that I am human. I\u2019m not fake. I make mistakes and I mess up as a dancer.\u201d\n\nThere you have the key issues for these young performers to juggle: How to hook their fans. How to keep luring new ones. How to post top-notch, original work five or more days a week. How to balance awesomeness and relatability, the chief currency to a digital audience. That\u2019s especially true at the younger end of the millennial spectrum, those 18- to 25-year-olds \u2014 so coveted by marketers, so difficult to reach \u2014 who want to see themselves in their heroes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEveryone in this industry is trying to figure out what goes viral,\u201d Hatala says with a sigh. \u201cMost of the time the videos that I put the hardest work into only get so many views. And a lot of the videos that have gone viral have just been, literally, me dancing and having so much fun in the studio, not expecting anything out of it. Or just with my dad and his phone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to stay on top of it,\u201d she adds. \u201cYou have to be looking at your insights, and just see what your followers like.\u201d\n\nStaying on top in the digital landscape is more art than science, even though science can help. Analytics show what demographic they\u2019re reaching, where their fans are, what posts keep their attention.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the first generation of dancers that combine the pixie dust and the data,\u201d says Larry Shapiro, chief executive of Ensemble Digital Studios, an artist management company. Among his clients is Kaycee Rice, a 17-year-old hip-hop dancer with fierce energy and extraordinary flexibility. She has more than 2 million Instagram followers and two YouTube channels, where, she says, she gains 200 to 500 subscribers a day.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe difference between Paula Abdul at her start and Kaycee Rice is that Kaycee analyzes the data behind her videos, like engagement and retention rate,\u201d Shapiro says.\n\nThis means that Rice can get the brands that sponsor her \u2014 Nike, Under Armour and others \u2014 before more eyeballs.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou have an entire generation around the world who identifies with her,\u201d Shapiro says. \u201cKaycee is reaching 13- to 18-year-old kids and shaping what kind of entertainment they like. So when she grows up and produces bigger projects, she\u2019ll have fans whose values she\u2019s shaped.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of power in these dancers\u2019 hands. Industry experts see them changing the music industry, too, as the public appetite for dance grows across social media. Once upon a time, record labels insisted that dancers take down videos they had created without getting permission to use the music. That impulse has evolved, says John Shahidi, who runs Shots Studios, an Internet talent management company.\n\nAD\n\nOne of his clients is Delaney Glazer, 23, a dancer who toured with Bieber and now posts short dance videos for her 1.4 million followers on Instagram (who know her as @deeglazer) and makes longer, high-quality ones for her YouTube channel, often with a narrative arc and shot on locations around Los Angeles.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEvery week we get one or two songs from a label saying, \u2018What can Delaney do with this?\u2019 \u201d Shahidi says. \u201cThey\u2019re looking at social media creators as a platform. Instead of asking us to take it down, they\u2019re embracing us.\u201d\n\nInfluencers in general tend to have a bad reputation \u2014 all flash and no substance. \u201cThe word \u2018influencer\u2019 confuses people,\u201d says Glazer, who likes to think of herself as \u201cusing dance to bring life and happiness and energy, instead of just products.\u201d\n\nIndeed, social media\u2019s dance stars defy the judgment of shallowness. To start with, their skills look superhuman. Their talent is obvious and easy to appreciate.\n\nAD\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a connoisseur to admire, for instance, KidatheGrea t\u2019s effortless popping moves in the videos he makes with his buddies. He shoots them in his kitchen. His Instagram posts are like little dance parties, where the cool kids are hanging out between the stove and the sink. Their relaxed vibe is irresistible. (Fair warning: The song lyrics aren\u2019t always G rated.)\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe kitchen, it\u2019s perfect for dance,\u201d says Kida, 17, whose full name is Leon Burns. \u201cAnd my gut told me just do it. Just stay in the kitchen.\u201d\n\nHe whips up the choreography in about 15 minutes.\n\n\u201cI ask my friends, \u2018What song are you guys feeling right now?\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cI come up with the song literally minutes before they get to my house, and then we make the magic.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Kida was the Season 13 winner of the Fox show \u201cSo You Think You Can Dance.\u201d He also has toured with Usher, performed in Chris Brown\u2019s \u201cParty\u201d video and traveled the world teaching master classes. But strange as it may seem, dancing in his kitchen is how he supports his family.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSince his SYTYCD win, Kida has amassed nearly 4 million followers on Instagram. Experts say that number can translate into five and six figures per product deal.\n\nIt\u2019s about time, says the dance community, which has been historically undervalued everywhere, even in the glamour world of Hollywood and television.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the millions of dollars that many of these dance influencers can earn,\u201d says Aris Golemi, a ballet-dancer-turned-agent and founder of Xcel Talent Agency and Dance Influencers, a global platform. \u201cI represented one dancer who made $9,000 just posting a selfie with a watch.\u201d\n\nGolemi had a breakthrough eight years ago when his client Marquese Scott \u2014 soon to be one of the biggest dancers on social media \u2014 created an iconic solo video, where his body seemed to melt and reform with every measure, to the song \u201cPumped Up Kicks.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe ended up traveling the world, making all this money with Google and YouTube,\u201d Golemi says. \u201cI could have 10 dancers working with Taylor Swift for a week and we wouldn\u2019t make that kind of money. I never thought that would be possible with just dancing. But social media changed everything.\u201d\n\nThe independent, inspiring spirit of these dancers is a big part of their appeal. What they offer their audience is individual creativity, sometimes loud and raw, or goofy and sweet, sexy and strong, with a heavy beat.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to wait for an artist to hire me. I want to be my own artist,\u201d says James Derrick, known as @Bdash_2. A former competitor on NBC\u2019s \u201cWorld of Dance,\u201d he has a unique, exquisitely smooth style that blends krumping, popping and animation. At 30, he\u2019s an outlier among the younger set of influencers and doesn\u2019t have as many followers \u2014 his hover around 300,000 on Instagram, more on TikTok. Still, he\u2019s making money on a few product deals. More important, Bdash is a prime example of the layered creativity that\u2019s possible for dancers in the digital realm. He creates his own music, and aspires to build his following as a musical artist/dancer.\n\n\u201cWith these platforms, at the end of the day you don\u2019t need a label, all you need is fans,\u201d Bdash says. \u201cThat\u2019s why social media is golden for people like us, because you can become an artist without anyone holding us back and telling us what to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cDancers get done wrong,\u201d he says, recalling the time he was called to shoot a TV commercial and ended up waiting around for six hours, only to be told he wasn\u2019t needed after all.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how they look at us. I wanna change that, \u2019cause it\u2019s not cool. So you\u2019ve got to have people like me and the others say, \u2018We\u2019re stars, too.\u2019", "description": "How teenagers Taylor Hatala, Kidathegreat, Kaycee Rice and others are changing how we see and think about dance in the digital age.", "authors": ["Sarah L.
