It was really sad times. It was really sad and devastating for the whole family and when there is children involved, it\u2019s something that takes a long time to get over.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about her time on Strictly Come Dancing which was rumoured to have sparked the split initially, Louise said: \u2018I think it reminded me, and this was no one else\u2019s fault and definitely not Jamie\u2019s, things that go on in a marriage are far deeper than a TV programme.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s different emotions and feelings which go on for years. I think what the programme really did for me it just reminded me of how much I really loved performing and music and singing.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018I get asked about it all the time and I never try and shut it down because I think it\u2019s happened and it was very public. But when there\u2019s a whole family involved, it\u2019s massive in everybody\u2019s life.\u2019\n\nJamie Redknapp and Louise Redknapp (Picture: David M. Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images)\n\nSpeaking about Jamie\u2019s influence on her new album, Louise said: \u2018I never went into making the album about that because you don\u2019t, but naturally when you\u2019re writing and you\u2019re in the studio and it\u2019s your safe haven, you naturally pour your heart out. That\u2019s your safe place.\n\n\u2018So I\u2019d definitely say there\u2019s songs on the album that are never bashing, it\u2019s not about being overly personal, it\u2019s how I felt just as a woman, as a mum, as a wife.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nViewers however were flabbergasted by Richard\u2019s questioning.\n\nRichard asks the questions no one else dare.
