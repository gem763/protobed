Once again, the debate stage showcased a lackluster group of extremist politicians pandering to their far-left base of support with harmful policy proposals that are way outside the mainstream.\n\nThe three septuagenarian candidates currently making up the top tier of the Democratic field include a confused and corrupt former Vice President Joe Biden some 20 years past his prime; unelectable socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who recently suffered a heart attack; and hopelessly out-of-touch former Harvard professor and current Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who wants to throw 180 million Americans off their private health insurance plans, including union workers.\n\nStuck with a field marred with enormous electability questions, no one is paying closer attention to the weakest field of presidential candidates in recent memory than 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\nWARREN COMES UNDER ATTACK FROM ALL SIDES AT DEM DEBATE, AS BIDEN DEFENDS SON'S BUSINESS PRACTICES\n\nThese two nationally recognized liberals are likely thinking the same thing as everyone else: none of the 12 mediocre candidates on the stage in Ohio Tuesday night has what it takes to defeat President Trump in November 2020.\n\nAfter watching the three-hour snooze fest, here are some of the takeaways that Clinton and Bloomberg may be thinking about as they consider jumping into the presidential race.\n\nThe Democratic candidates are desperately lurching farther and farther to the left. This strategy of embracing extremism is clearly designed to capture the hearts and minds of the Democratic primary electorate by repackaging the tired Big Government policies of the past. Capitalism and liberty have become dirty words with this crowd. Look no further than new reports Tuesday night that Green New Deal author and socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York \u2013 along with radical Reps. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota \u2013 plan to endorse Sanders for president. Throughout history, socialism has failed at every turn and will fail once again as the Democrat\u2019s party platform in the 2020 general election.\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s son Hunter and his shady foreign business dealings were glossed over and badly mischaracterized. This should have been the big issue of the night. Serious allegations against the Bidens are being whitewashed by a biased mainstream media that has gone headfirst into the dishonesty tank during the Trump administration.\n\nThe impeachment witch hunt led the discussion because the Democratic Party has no positive agenda. All the candidates reminded viewers about the partisan nature of the baseless impeachment inquiry against President Trump by rushing to judgment before getting the facts. It\u2019s become clear that impeachment is being pushed because desperate Democrats can\u2019t defeat Trump at the ballot box in less than 13 months.\n\nDemocrats are offering the American people big tax increases, job-killing over-regulation, and lawless open borders. These failed and harmful ideas aren\u2019t polling well with voters. But the far-left Democrats are so committed to Big Government that they ignore the fact that their plans would wreck the vibrant Trump economy and punish American families and businesses.\n\n\u201cMedicare-for-all,\u201d championed by Sanders, is so extreme that even some of the Democratic presidential candidates oppose it. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., pointed out that the disastrous proposal would result in a \u201cmultitrillion-dollar hole\u201d in the federal budget. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota called the irresponsible plan a \u201cpipedream.\u201d They\u2019re both right.\n\nThe debate will not change the trajectory of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Nothing happened to suggest someone had a breakout moment and will show real upward movement in the polls. The top tier will remain Warren, Biden and Sanders.\n\nDespite the best efforts of Democrats, President Trump\u2019s amazing accomplishments to improve the lives of the American people simply cannot be explained away. The national unemployment rate of 3.5 percent is at a 50-year low and the unemployment rates for women, African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans are at historic lows. Over 6 million jobs have been created on President Trump\u2019s watch \u2013 including 500,000 manufacturing jobs \u2013 and a record number of Americans are currently employed. To paraphrase former President Bill Clinton, elections are about the strong economy \u2013 and continued prosperity.\n\nIn a debate that featured barely a spark \u2013 much less fireworks \u2013 there\u2019s ample reason for Democratic power brokers around the country to be concerned about where the current overcrowded field is headed. So they might be looking for other options before the Iowa caucuses kick off voting for the presidential candidates in February.\n\nHere\u2019s the reality:\n\nJob creators, entrepreneurs and investors alike know that President Trump at his core thinks like a pro-growth businessman, and that gives them confidence to make decisions that expand their businesses.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nOn trade, President Trump\u2019s vision and leadership have changed opinions on how we approach China, Mexico, Canada, and the European Union. The president knows there is a difference between free trade and fair trade when it comes to prioritizing American workers.\n\nIn Tuesday night\u2019s debate in the critical Rust Belt state of Ohio \u2013 as the Democrats highlighted their failed vision of tax increases, overregulation, and giving away the store to China \u2013 the contrast with the positive Trump record couldn\u2019t be starker.\n\nWell-known liberal egotists Clinton and Bloomberg certainly think a lot of themselves and despite their baggage could probably fare better against President Trump than the current slate of boring Democrat wannabes.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd if the Democrats really want to recreate the 2008 Obama coalition, there\u2019s another candidate who could immediately become the party\u2019s frontrunner due to nostalgia alone. Her name is Michelle Obama. But the problem with nostalgia is that we tend to remember what we liked and forget what we didn\u2019t like.\n\nThe clear reality emerging at the end of the long debate was that these are desperate times for a Democratic Party suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DAVID BOSSIE", "description": "A dozen Democratic presidential candidates continued their race to become the left\u2019s most favored socialist when they debated Tuesday night.
