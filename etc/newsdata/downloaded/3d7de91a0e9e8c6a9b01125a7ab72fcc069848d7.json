It\u2019s a highly significant move that takes no-deal off the table and consigns Johnson\u2019s October 31 Brexit date to the dustbin.\n\nAlso on rt.com Johnson says he\u2019d rather be \u2018dead in a ditch\u2019 than ask EU for Brexit delay\n\nJohnson has been relentless since the summer that no government that he leads would still be stuck in the EU post October 31. As early as June, during his Tory leadership campaign, he was resolute in his determination to deliver Brexit on time.\n\nWe are getting ready to come out on October 31. Come what may. Do or die.\n\nIn a public address outside 10 Downing street in September, he was adamant that he would not ask Brussels for any further delays, insisting that the UK would be leaving the bloc on time, \u201cno ifs or buts.\u201d A few days later, in a speech during a visit to a police training center in West Yorkshire, the UK prime minister claimed that he would rather \u201cbe dead in a ditch\u201d than ask for a delay.\n\nEyebrow-raising rhetoric, indeed, and it that has ostensibly rebounded in the form of brutal mockery on social media, including from high-profile figures such as Guy Verhofstadt , the EU\u2019s Brexit Coordinator.\n\nVerhofstadt took to Twitter shortly after Tusk\u2019s announcement on a renewed Brexit delay to take a pop at Johnson\u2019s past comments, tweeting: \u201cRelieved that, finally, no one died in a ditch.\u201d Others also made fun of Johnson\u2019s somewhat overly dramatic rhetoric, saying: \u201cLife\u2019s a ditch and then you die in it.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also been a deluge of GIFs focusing on the prime minister\u2019s equally far-fetched \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge over what he\u2019d seen as a repulsive option of another extension.\n\nLive footage of Boris Johnson's 'do or die' Brexit pledge pic.twitter.com/ATj8jrxTVF \u2014 Jack Maidment (@jrmaidment) October 28, 2019\n\n\u201cAnd then he said \u2018Brexit on 31st October, do or die!\u2019\u201d pic.twitter.com/KAnciP5VTS \u2014 Ben Stanley (@BDStanley) October 28, 2019\n\nResponding to the EU\u2019s three-month Brexit \u2018flextension\u2019, Johnson\u2019s spokesman insisted that the prime minister\u2019s \u201cview has not changed, Parliament should not have put the UK in this position and we should be leaving on October 31.\u201d\n\nThe so-called \u2018flextension\u2019 would mean that Britain could leave the bloc before the renewed deadline day if, in the meantime, a deal is ratified by the UK parliament. The measure comes as UK lawmakers prepare to vote later on Monday on PM Boris Johnson\u2019s proposals for a snap general election on December 12.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
