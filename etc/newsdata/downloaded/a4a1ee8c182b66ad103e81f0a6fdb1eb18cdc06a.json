Apple will let you trade in your iPhone XR in good working condition for up to $370 if you want the iPhone 11, bringing the iPhone 11's price tag down to $330. You'll have to gauge whether its extra features are worth $330 on top of what you paid for the iPhone XR in 2018.\n\nHere are the most important things to consider when choosing between the iPhone XR and the iPhone 11:", "description": "For $100 more, the iPhone 11 offers a few things you might want to consider before buying the iPhone XR.", "authors": ["Antonio Villas-Boas"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7937132e22af0ddd488ac8-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
