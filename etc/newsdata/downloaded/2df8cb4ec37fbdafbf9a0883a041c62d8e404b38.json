He was a sick and depraved man and now he\u2019s gone.\u2019\n\nIt was earlier reported that al-Baghdadi\u2019s two wives were also killed during the ensuing firefight.\n\nAfter the airstrike last night, Trump tweeted: \u2018Something very big has just happened!\u2019.\n\nFootage of a raid emerged this morning, claiming to show the moment the terrorist died in a huge explosion.\n\nAl-Baghdadi encouraged jihadists to engage in smaller-scale acts of terrorism across the world (Picture: AFP)\n\nA picture showing Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi giving a speech in an unknown location, released in 2019 (Picture: AP)\n\nThe clip, released by Syrian activists, captures a series of deafening bangs followed by an eerie silence.\n\nAl-Baghdadi was one of the most wanted figures in the world since 2014 when he issued a sinister call to arms declaring an Islamic \u2018caliphate\u2019.\n\nUnder his rule he encouraged jihadists to engage in smaller-scale acts of terrorism which would be much harder for law enforcement to prepare against.\n\nThese instructions resulted in numerous attacks across the UK and Europe, including the Manchester Arena bombing which claimed the lives of 23 people.\n\nCNN reports al-Baghdadi\u2019s messages encouraged more than 140 terrorist attacks in 29 countries, excluding Iraq and Syria, killing at least 2,043 people.\n\nSyrians ride a motorcycle past a burnt vehicle near the site where a helicopter gunfire reportedly killed nine people near the northwestern Syrian village of Barisha in the Idlib province (picture AFP)\n\nIn recent years the leader has been far less visible due to a \u00a319.5 million bounty on his head.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever last month he released an audio recording calling on his followers to do all they could to free Isis detainees and women from the terrorist group being held in jails.\n\nThe Isis leader has been wrongly reported to be dead on previous occasions.\n\nIf his death is confirmed, it will be seen as a win for Mr Trump in his upcoming election campaign but an Islamic group expert has questioned how much of an impact the killing will have long-term.\n\nMarwan Shihadah, specialist and researcher of Islamic groups, told Reuters: \u2018Following the nature of these groups, they do not very much get affected by the loss of any first level leader.\n\n\u2018There is no doubt it will affect some of the segments of this group. It is also considered a victory for the U.S president Trump in terms of the coming elections.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018It seems that its (the operation\u2019s) timing came after the end of the fountain of peace operation. It seems also according to some media outlets that regional countries or one regional country participated in the intelligence work for this operation.\n\n\u2018(This country) has not been named to avoid negative repercussions or revenge operations that the group (IS) might carry out. I think that Turkey has a role in the intelligence work.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
