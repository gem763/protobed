I don\u2019t see myself as one of the first names on the teamsheet. If you become complacent, that\u2019s when someone pushes you out of the way.\n\n\u201cPeople like Browney did fantastically in the game against Bulgaria and he\u2019ll be pushing me for my place, so I know I need to be on top of my game to be on the teamsheet come Saturday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be working this week like I\u2019m fighting for my place, like it\u2019s one of my first caps, and hopefully be selected for the weekend.\u201d\n\nHourihane\u2019s caution is founded on his experiences during a career to date which has seen him released as a teenager by Sunderland and then Ipswich a year later before rebooting in League Two with Plymouth.\n\nJust to reflect on how well @ConorHourihane actually did in our last meeting with Georgia. He was on \ud83d\udd25\n\n\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 days to #GEOIRL \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddea pic.twitter.com/jJiuop6Fuv \u2014 FAIreland \u26bd\ufe0f\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddea (@FAIreland) October 8, 2019\n\nA two-and-a-half-year spell at Barnsley won him his move to Villa, for whom he scored in a 5-1 Premier League win at Norwich on Saturday to confirm his return.\n\nIt has been a long and arduous road and for that reason, even his key role in McCarthy\u2019s qualification blueprint will not deflect him from his mission to keep his feet firmly on the ground.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen I dropped down to League Two, I always had that self-confidence and self-belief that I would come back up.\n\n\u201cI worked so hard, even on my days off, working hard, sacrificing everything to make it happen.\n\nANOTHER goal AND an assist on Saturday.\n\n\n\nWhat GIF are you choosing to sum up this man's performance?#PL #AVFC pic.twitter.com/xMVtO2CGxS \u2014 Aston Villa (@AVFCOfficial) October 7, 2019\n\n\u201cYes, it was great at the weekend and it shows hard work does pay off with those kinds of moments, but it is one I won\u2019t be resting on. I\u2019m never satisfied with my game, I\u2019m always my worst critic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m working on my game this week again to try to improve. Maybe later on in my career, or when I\u2019m finished, I\u2019ll look back on it with great pride, but now is not the time to look back on it, it\u2019s time to kick on again.\u201d\n\nHourihane\u2019s goal at Carrow Road means he has now scored in all of England\u2019s top four divisions, but that too is something he intends to improve upon, particularly at international level, where his winner against Georgia at the Aviva Stadium in March represents his total haul.\n\nLeague 2 \u2705\u26bd\ufe0f.

Denmark are a very good side, so if Georgia held them at 0-0, it shows what a good side they are.\u201d", "description": "The midfielder had to drop down to League Two to rebuild his career.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/12/wire-19440948-1570535615-845_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
