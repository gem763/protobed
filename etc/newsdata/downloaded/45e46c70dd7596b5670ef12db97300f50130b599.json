Thunberg fell back in the crowd. \u201cWe love you, Greta,\u201d fans yelled.\n\nTrump, who has repeatedly denied climate science, is gutting every major US effort to stem the greenhouse gases from fossil fuels that are heating the globe, as well as rolling back or attempting to dilute other environmental protections related to air and water quality and wildlife protection.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Youth activists take art in a climate protest outside the White House in Washington DC, on 13 September.
