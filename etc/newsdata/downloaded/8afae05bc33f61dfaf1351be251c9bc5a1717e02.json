As Trysta Krick details, they do have one saving grace. USA TODAY\n\nSam Darnold returned from his bout with mononucleosis to lead the New York Jets to the upset of the season so far. The Dallas Cowboys, meanwhile, are left looking for answers following a third consecutive defeat.\n\nWhile the Cowboys look like pretenders, the San Francisco 49ers look like legit contenders. They improved to 5-0 with a decisive win over the defending NFC champion Los Angeles Rams. The 49ers and New England Patriots are the lone remaining unbeaten teams.\n\nIt was a rough Sunday for the top two selections in the 2015 NFL draft. After Jameis Winston threw five interceptions in a loss to the Carolina Panthers in London, Marcus Mariota was benched in a loss to the Denver Broncos. One has to wonder if both franchises will move on at the quarterback position after this season.\n\nSam Darnold returned after missing three games to deliver the Jets' first win of the season.

Chargers TE Hunter Henry returned to action for the first time since suffering a knee injury in Week 1 and looked like he never missed a beat. Henry had eight catches for 100 yards and two touchdowns. He\u2019s a TE1 going forward. Also, Redskins running back Adrian Peterson registered season highs in carries (23) and rushing yards (118) in Week 6. Facing the winless Dolphins might have been a factor, but new coach Bill Callahan\u2019s run-first philosophy will put the ball in Peterson\u2019s hands much more often. They may not be available in all leagues, but if anxious owners in yours cut Henry or Peterson due to their lack of production, now\u2019s the time to pounce.\n\nreturned to action for the first time since suffering a knee injury in Week 1 and looked like he never missed a beat.

The loss of TE Will Dissly to an Achilles injury could result in more targets for Brown going forward.\n\n, who scored on two of his three receptions for 29 yards. The loss of TE to an Achilles injury could result in more targets for Brown going forward.
