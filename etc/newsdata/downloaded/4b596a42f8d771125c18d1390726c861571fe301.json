REUTERS/Peter Andrews\n\nFunds remain heavily short, betting that copper demand is set to worsen amid what is looking like a synchronised downturn in the global manufacturing sector.\n\nThe copper price is starting to buckle under the weight of speculative selling pressure but it\u2019s not yet ready to collapse.\n\nLondon Metal Exchange three-month copper could easily have imploded on last Tuesday\u2019s lurch lower but instead clawed its way back to close the week at $5,833.\n\nMarket sentiment was helped by the prospect of renewed trade talks between the United States and China but also by copper\u2019s still robust internal supply-demand dynamics, not least China\u2019s continued appetite for imported metal.\n\nThe copper market, not for the first time, is finely balanced between the forces of macro negativity and micro positivity.\n\nSTORM CLOUDS\n\nThe economic storm clouds darkened again last week.\n\nU.S. manufacturing activity contracted for the first time in three years in August, the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (ISM) index falling to 49.1 last month from 51.2 in July.\n\nIt was the fifth straight monthly decline in the index with new orders tumbling sharply to 47.2, the lowest level since June 2012.\n\nThe United States had been an increasingly isolated bright spot in the broader manufacturing gloom, lending extra significance to last month\u2019s weak snapshot.\n\nIn the euro zone, manufacturing activity has been contracting for seven straight months with German copper products maker Wieland reducing working hours this month in the face of disappointing demand.\n\nActivity remains soft in Asian manufacturing hubs such as Japan, South Korea and, critically for industrial metals, China.\n\nChina\u2019s official purchasing managers index remained in contractionary territory for the fourth straight month in August, although the private-sector Caixin index generated a slightly more positive reading above the 50 growth-contraction threshold. Even it, though, showed continued weakness in new orders, both domestic and export.\n\nTHE BIG SHORT\n\nGiven such flashing warning signals about the health of global manufacturing, it should be no big surprise that funds continue to hold a big collective short position on the CME copper contract.\n\nThe latest Commitments of Traders Report showed funds holding outright short positions of 117,898 contracts as of last Tuesday, within touching distance of the all-time record of 118,448 contracts seen in the middle of last month.\n\nCopper\u2019s late-week recovery will have likely caused some trimming of that position but the overwhelming weight of money on the U.S. exchange is still betting against Doctor Copper.\n\nFunds active in the London market appear to be more ambivalent, LME broker Marex Spectron assessing the net speculative short at a relatively modest 6.4% of open interest as of last Wednesday.\n\nChinese speculative players remain sidelined, judging by the low volume and open interest levels on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) copper contract.\n\nThat in itself is probably a key factor in copper\u2019s ability to withstand the selling heat on the U.S. market.\n\nCHINESE IMPORTS STILL ROBUST\n\nChina is also a key positive factor in copper\u2019s supply-demand dynamics right now.\n\nPreliminary figures for August showed imports of unwrought copper, aggregating refined metal, anode, alloy and semi-fabricated products, falling by 3.8% to 404,000 tonnes in August with year-to-date imports tracking 10.8% lower than last year.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth remembering that last year\u2019s refined copper imports were an all-time record at 3.8 million tonnes, putting the headline declines into context.\n\nGiven the undoubted weakness in Chinese manufacturing activity recently, current import volumes are surprisingly robust.\n\nParticularly since China is still actively building out its own copper refining capacity to reduce its call on metal from the international marketplace.\n\nThe country\u2019s smelters continue to hoover up raw materials with imports of mined concentrates booming. Last year\u2019s imports came in at a record 19.7 million tonnes (bulk weight) and imports in the first eight months of this year were up another 11% at 14.4 million.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that declining scrap imports are boosting import demand for both raw materials and refined metal.\n\nScrap flows have been falling since the start of last year due to tightening purity thresholds for Chinese imports and, more recently, tariffs on U.S. copper scrap.\n\nChina imported 32% less copper scrap last year and the slide has extended into 2019 with January-July imports down a further 27%, although rising purity levels mitigate some of the headline drop in bulk tonnage.\n\nTotal imports of copper in all forms suggest no dramatic collapse in demand from the world\u2019s biggest buyer.\n\nIndeed, China\u2019s continued import strength has kept a lid on visible exchange inventory. Combined stocks registered with the LME, the CME and the ShFE totalled 519,500 tonnes at the end of August, up 169,000 tonnes since the start of the year but down by 54,000 tonnes on August 2018.\n\nBAD NEWS IS GOOD NEWS?\n\nThe copper price is still in dangerous chart territory with the threat that another slide could trigger the sort of follow-through selling activity that was conspicuous by its absence last week.\n\nHopes for a breakthrough in the stalled U.S.-China trade talks provided an important lifeline for copper over the back end of last week.\n\nBut we\u2019ve also entered a period of the economic cycle when bad news is taken by the markets as good news.\n\nThe faster economic indices deteriorate, the greater the expectations for a stimulus reaction whether it be in the form of U.S. Fed interest rate cuts, more quantitative easing from the European Central Bank or more infrastructure spend from China.\n\nThe latter may be one reason why Chinese speculators don\u2019t much fancy going short copper, even if it\u2019s clear they\u2019re not enthused about going long either.\n\nCoordinated policy action by other central banks may cause bear funds to blink, if they believe it will stabilise global factory activity.\n\nCopper\u2019s own fundamentals, however solid they might be right now, are serving only to hold the price at these low levels.\n\nThe next big move will be determined by the money men.\n\nThe opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.", "description": "Copper last week hit a year-to-date low of $5,518 per tonne in the London market as the macroeconomic picture becomes ever gloomier.", "authors": ["Andy Home", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427953687&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8816G", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
