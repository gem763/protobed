It calls for the government to negotiate the prices of the 250 costliest medicine \u2014 including insulin. The amounts would be pegged to the lower costs that prevail in developed countries overseas, including much of Europe. The Trump administration has also embraced the concept, known as an international price index, in a huge break with GOP orthodoxy.\n\nTop Democrats insist the plan is not a political maneuver and that leadership is focused solely on writing the most ambitious bill possible. But by including Trump\u2019s proposal on foreign pricing, the Pelosi draft offers a more expansive vision than the White House-backed legislation currently stalled in the Senate. In many ways, it captures the spirit of Trump\u2019s populist rhetoric about greedy drug companies getting away with murder.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason in the world why everyday Americans pay more for lifesaving prescription drugs than any other country in the world,\u201d New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who chairs the House Democratic caucus, said Tuesday, echoing some of the president\u2019s most reliable applause lines. \u201cBig pharma and its anti-competitive practices are totally out of control. We need to put an end to it.\u201d\n\nPelosi is also aiming for a sweet spot between moderate pragmatists and her party\u2019s fiery progressive wing.\n\n\u201cThe whole goal has been to make sure this is something that could actually get signed into law,\u201d said Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), who co-chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus that has made drug pricing a signature focus.\n\nPrescription Pulse A weekly briefing on pharmaceutical policy news \u2014 in your inbox.

It's far tougher on drug interests than had been expected, discarding a proposal reviled by liberals to use a third-party arbiter, instead of the government, to decide the cost of drugs. It also would apply the negotiated drug prices to the private insurance market. Progressives and consumer groups privately cheered the draft, despite officials' warnings that details could still change.\n\nHouse Democratic leaders are likely to circulate a more fleshed out version of the plan as early as Wednesday, Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), a member of Pelosi's whip team, told reporters.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s got some major elements that are quite good,\u201d Schakowsky said. \u201cIt has to be one of our major pieces of legislation.\u201d\n\nThe official unveiling \u2014 which will likely come initially in the form of a discussion draft rather than official legislation \u2014 will kick off a push to finalize the bill and advance it through the House\u2019s top health committees as soon as the end of the month.\n\nFrom there, Democrats have emphasized the need to pass the bill before the year\u2019s end \u2014 regardless whether Trump supports it.\n\n\u201cThe reliability of what the president says he\u2019s on board with has a very short shelf life, so it\u2019s hard to know,\u201d Schakowsky said. \u201cWe have to move ahead anyway.\u201d\n\nSeveral potential hurdles remain, though. House progressives long skeptical of leadership\u2019s drug pricing work want assurances a final bill will go far enough \u2014 even after the draft moved significantly left on several points.\n\nThe liberal bloc is pushing for more drugs to be subject to price negotiations and tough sanctions on drug companies that refuse to enter into talks with the government. Pelosi's plan would impose an excise tax equal to 75 percent of the gross sales of the drug in question from the previous year.\n\nMost important, Congressional Progressive Caucus leaders said Tuesday, is that leadership be transparent about what the legislation looks like.\n\n\u201cHaving our input considered is important, and so that\u2019s certainly there and that\u2019s encouraging\u201d Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) said of the draft. \u201cBut we just don\u2019t know where we are in the process.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are also keeping an eye on moderates, many of whom could face tough reelection fights in 2020. That group has taken a far more muted stance on drug pricing, signaling they\u2019re focused largely on legislation that can make it into law \u2014 even if it means reining in the party\u2019s biggest ambitions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some common ground that could be had here to try to move something in this session,\u201d said Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.). \u201cThe question is, how far does leadership want to take their non-negotiating position with Republicans and the White House?\u201d\n\nStill, for the first time in their nine months in power, House Democrats now have some clear direction on their top health policy priority \u2014 and are spoiling for a showdown.\n\n\"I look forward to it. It's a big one,\" said Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.), a close Pelosi ally. \"It'll be a fight.\"\n\n", "description": "The six-page proposal that surfaced Monday is more progressive than many expected.", "authors": ["Sarah Karlin-Smith", "Adam Cancryn"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/db/11/17b5f290400abf540c0dd8727faf/190910-nancy-pelosi-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
