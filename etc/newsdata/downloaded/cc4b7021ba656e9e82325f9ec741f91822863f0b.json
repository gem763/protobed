To make sure that the women availing the rides are safe, each bus will have a \u201cbus marshal\u201d, a cop whose duty is to make sure that the women are not harassed during their commute. This move was announced on Tuesday, in what Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal dubbed a Bhai Dooj gift to the women of Delhi.\n\nIn a message posted to both the CM\u2019s and AAP\u2019s social media pages, Kejriwal said that this was a step to close the socio-economic gap between men and women, and also a way to aid the underprivileged sections of the city.\n\nAs of now, the scheme has been implemented on 3,700 DTC buses and 1,800 buses under the cluster scheme of the Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS).\n\nA Timeline Of Kejriwal\u2019s Free Travel For Women Scheme\n\nThe Delhi CM had announced the scheme to make public transport free for women during his Independence Day speech earlier this year. He had said that both Delhi Metro Rail Corporation trains as well as DTC and cluster buses will be made free for women.\n\nIn August, he followed it up with an announcement that Delhi government would set aside Rs 290 crore for implementing the plan to make public transport (Delhi Metro and buses) free for women. However, the Supreme Court in September put a dampener on the Aam Aadmi Party's plans by warning that the move will economically cripple the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation.\n\nGiven Delhi\u2019s partial statehood status, the scheme was also caught between AAP in Delhi, and the BJP at the Centre. While the plans to subsidise Metro travel seem to be on hold, Kejriwal has partly delivered on his promise.\n\nIs it unfair?\n\nThe biggest criticism of the move is that it is gender-specific, instead of being targeted to the underprivileged residents of the capital.\n\n\n\nBut given that the gender wage-gap is alive and thriving in India, perhaps this will become an equaliser in the lives of the women who need the boost the most.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Women in Delhi can now travel for free on the state-run DTC buses.
