The treasurer for Joe Biden\u2019s super PAC is a registered foreign agent (via The Federalist):\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has a brand new Super PAC in his corner, and it\u2019s being run by a registered foreign agent for the government of Azerbaijan. Larry Rasky, a lobbyist who previously worked as a top campaign operative for Biden, is listed as the treasurer of the PAC, according to records filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC). \u201cA former Joe Biden aide has filed paperwork to form a super PAC, called Unite the Country, that is set to boost the former vice president with millions of dollars in spending in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary,\u201d Politico reported on Tuesday. Records filed with the Department of Justice show that Rasky is also a registered foreign agent lobbying on behalf of the government of Azerbaijan. The records, which were filed pursuant to the Foreign Agent Registration Act, show that Rasky was hired by the Azerbaijani government on April 23, 2019. Federal documents signed by Rasky show that he reports directly to Elin Suleymanov, Azerbaijan\u2019s ambassador to the United States.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s not get too excited. I\u2019m just noting the double-standards here. If Trump had some registered foreign agent running his super PAC, CNN and MSNBC would be in full forth. This isn\u2019t Manchurian Candidate stuff, but the media would certainly twist it into that if Trump or any Republican had made this staff hire, think Red Dawn 2: Endgame nonsense from the Left. Trump-Russia collusion is a myth, but Joe Biden has yet to answer fully and decisively about his family\u2019s ties to Ukraine. His son, Hunter, was on the board of an energy company making $50,000/month despite having zero experience in this line of work. The allegation, which has yet to be dispelled, is that he was there selling access while daddy was vice president. Foreign agents are running the super PAC of a candidate who could be the 2020 Democratic nominee. Based on the rules established by the liberal media pundit-sphere, this is problematic. This is treason a and Biden should be canceled.", "description": ".10/29/2019 19:55:53PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/301/39194dd5-b51e-491f-8d46-6b7840a18b62.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
