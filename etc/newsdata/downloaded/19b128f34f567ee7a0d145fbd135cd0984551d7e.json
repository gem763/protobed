They've just said no. It's sexism pure and simple. It's absolutely ridiculous to say women are more hardworking or polite. I was born female anyway.\n\n\"They're sticking by their comments too. They've put it on their own Facebook page [since deleted].\n\n(Image: Google Maps/Kennedy News)\n\n\"They said 'in my opinion women are better on phone by taking takeaway orders of customers. They're patient, they are hard working'.\"\n\nJorge added: \"My confidence hasn't been knocked because I've had some nice comments, but I've been looking for work now for the last few months. I'd clean toilets if I had to - I'm one of those people.\"\n\nA man who identified himself as the acting manager of Anchor Fish and Chips, in Nottingham, admitted that it was he who wrote that they wanted to hire a woman.\n\nThe manager said: \"Nothing was about discrimination - it was just a misunderstanding.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"I wrote this. Basically, we have had a few guys working here answering the phone but they weren't doing the job properly.\n\n\"We have a girl who has been working with us for more than a year. So I thought it was right to have a female answer the phone talking to people. I did not know it was illegal. I did not mean to discriminate against people.\n\n\"I couldn't post the advert just for a female. In my opinion, females do this job [order taking] better than male staff. I just said 'in my opinion'. I didn't say it was a fact.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\n\nThe owner of The Anchor Fish and Chips said: \"We don't only hire female staff - we've got lots of male staff.\n\n\"I'll definitely do something about this. That's not the case. It's not my opinion. I'll change my password [to our social media page]. He is not supposed to post stuff like that.\n\n\"I would be happy to hire a male or female member of staff for this job.\"", "description": "Jobseeker Jorge Gorman, 33, claims the Nottingham takeaway shunned him because he isn't female", "authors": ["Sophie Norris", "Sam Elliott", "Image", "Kennedy News", "Media", "Ian Cooper North Wales Live", "Google Maps Kennedy News", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20671311.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-Kennedy-News-and-Mediajpga.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
