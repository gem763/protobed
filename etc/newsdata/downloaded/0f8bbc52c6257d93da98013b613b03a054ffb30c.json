This is a final, I\u2019m really privileged to be here in the first place, so keep fighting.\u201d\n\nOsaka was in control now and broke Barty \u2014 who five years ago took a rest from tennis and played cricket \u2014 in the first game of the deciding set on the way to victory.\n\nThis was a third title of 2019 for Osaka and fifth in her short career.", "description": "Beijing (AFP) \u2013 Naomi Osaka won a second tournament on the spin as she fought back from a set down to defeat world number one Ashleigh Barty in the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/aca50d_naomi-osaka-japanon-her-way-victory-ashleigh-barty-australia-china-open-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
