The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -1.64% retreated 5.21 points, or 0.1% to 8,112.46.\n\nNeed to Know: The S&P 500\u2019s \u2018weakest week of the year\u2019 is here, but this is why one strategist isn\u2019t worried\n\nStocks remain within striking distance of all-time highs, with the S&P 500 1.1% below its all-time closing high of 3,025.86 set on July 26. After Monday\u2019s close, the Dow was off 1.5% from its record close of 27,359.16 set on July 15, while the Nasdaq remained 2.7% away from its all-time settlement high at 8,330.21 from July 26.\n\nWhat drove the market?\n\nThe market\u2019s modest advance Monday was led by real estate and consumer-staples stocks, defensive sectors that tend to outperform during periods of weaker growth. Consumer staples stocks were the best performing in the S&P 500, rising 0.4%, followed by real estate, up 0.2%.\n\nHelping fuel concerns of an economic slowdown were data that indicated manufacturing activity in the eurozone contracted more sharply in September, posting its worst reading in nearly seven years. The flash eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) fell to an 83-month low of 45.6 in September, down from 47 in August. Economists polled by FactSet had forecast a 47.3 reading \u2014 a figure of less than 50 indicates activity declined.\n\nIn particular, Germany\u2019s manufacturing PMI gauge fell to 41.4 in September, its worst reading in a decade. The biggest economy in the eurozone has been vulnerable to the deterioration of global conditions, drawing concerns that the export powerhouse will record its second consecutive quarter of negative growth from the June to September period, which would qualify as a technical recession.\n\n\u201cEuropean data is a concern, but investors are more focused on the U.S.,\u201d Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab told MarketWatch. \u201cThe market\u2019s been quiet because we\u2019re in sort of a middle ground where second quarter earnings are done and third quarter earnings haven\u2019t started yet . . . investors are left waiting for more clarification on China.\u201d\n\nRead: How the Fed\u2019s funding struggles highlight the fragility of Wall Street confidence\n\nThe cancellation of the visits to farms in Montana and Nebraska rattled stocks on Friday, along with remarks by President Donald Trump, who said he wanted a fully fledged deal with China rather than a limited agreement that addresses particular grievances. But officials said talks would continue, as planned, in October, helping to soothe worries, analysts said.\n\nBloomberg News reported that Chinese officials had canceled the farm visit at the request of the U.S., and not because of a stalling of trade negotiations.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the last week, trade talks were mostly positive with one major exception, the Chinese abrupt cancellation to visit a farm in Montana. While the news pretty much derailed the last attempt for U.S. stocks to hit fresh record highs, we should not see agricultural purchases be a key hurdle for the Chinese,\u201d wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA.\n\nInvestors also were interpreting Markit\u2019s take on U.S. activity, with its manufacturing index rising to a five-month high of 51, while the services sector hit a two-month high of 50.9.\n\nThe Chicago Fed\u2019s national activity index recorded a positive reading of 0.1 in August, up from negative 0.41 in the previous month.\n\nWhich stocks were in focus?\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Corp.

FDX, -0.89% fell 2.1%, putting the stock on pace to close at its lowest level since 2016.\n\nShares of Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -1.36% retreated 0.5% after Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak cut his price target on the firm by 4% to $2,200 \u2014 even as the new target is 24% above current levels.\n\nCaesars Entertainment Corp. CZR, -0.72% said it reached an agreement to sell the Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino to a company controlled by a principal of Imperial Companies for $516.3 million. Shares of Caesars declined 0.4%.\n\nCalifornia utility PG&E Corp. PCG, -7.98% shares lost 0.6% after the firm said it reached an agreement to resolve claims with entities representing 85% of the insurance claims from the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp Fire.\n\nInteractive Brokers Group Inc. IBKR, -3.08% fell 0.7% following an announcement by stock-market exchange IEX Group Inc. that it will exit the listings business.
