With thousands wounded and the deaths mounting - mostly from bullet wounds - the United Nations on Saturday urged an end to the deepening violence.\n\nSunday's decree also ordered the construction of 100,000 new housing units, following September's launch of demolitions of houses in informal settlements, which are home to three million Iraqis nationwide.\n\nIn response to staggering youth unemployment, which has reached around 25 per cent according to the World Bank, the government said it would create new jobs and boost benefits for those without work.\n\nOn Sunday, at least eight people were killed and 25 wounded in clashes as Iraqi forces used live rounds and tear gas to disperse hundreds of protesters in the streets around Sadr City, a Shia district in the south of Baghdad.", "description": "The Iraqi government on Sunday unveiled a series of social reforms in a bid to quell widespread unrest that has left more than 100 protesters dead in less than a week.", "authors": ["Our Foreign Staff", "Nick Timothy", "Sara Khan", "Tim Stanley"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/06/TELEMMGLPICT000212232419-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq-pfgFGBz9L_4V5dRQnfCxXSCcE_6DFR4bo0Gkhevkug.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
