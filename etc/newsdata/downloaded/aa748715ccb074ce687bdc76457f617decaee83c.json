In eight battleground ridings, Leadnow, a Vancouver non-profit with roots in the United States, was busy helping to try to defeat Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives. According to emails sent to anyone who subscribes, Leadnow made 150,000 phone calls, and in Greater Toronto, it ran radio ads against the Conservatives.\n\nI was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President. He's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term. \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) October 16, 2019\n\nLeadnow is one of the lead organizations in a Rockefeller-funded international effort called The Tar Sands Campaign that aims to land-lock oil and natural gas from Western provinces, keeping Canada out of the global oil market. Leadnow has organized protests against all of the pipeline projects that have been scrapped or stalled: Northern Gateway, Keystone XL, Energy East and Trans Mountain as well as Woodfibre LNG and the Coastal Gaslink project in northern B.C.\n\nLeadnow has portrayed itself as a thoroughly Canadian youth movement, but that is not the whole story\n\nIn eight ridings, Leadnow did door-knocking and helped to get out the vote for specific candidates. For the NDP: Taylor Bachrach, Skeena-Bulkley Valley; Matthew Green, Hamilton Centre; Daniel Blaikie, Elmwood Transcona; and Paul Taylor, Parkdale-High Park. For the Green party: Anna Keenan in Malpeque and Darcie Lanthier in Charlottetown. And for the Liberals: Lenore Zann in Cumberland-Colchester. Leadnow also did door-knocking and helped get the vote out for independent candidate Jody Wilson-Raybould.\n\nDuring the 2015 federal election, Leadnow was also active with a strategic voting campaign to defeat Conservatives in 29 swing ridings. All but five were defeated.\n\nOnline and in the media, Leadnow has portrayed itself as a thoroughly Canadian youth movement, the brainchild of two university students, Adam Shedletzky and Jamie Biggar. But that is not the whole story.\n\nLeadnow was created as part of the Strategic Incubation program of the Citizen Engagement Laboratory (CEL), a charitable foundation in Oakland, Calif. The CEL created and funded a project called the Online Progressive Engagement Network (OPEN).\n\nIn its 2015 annual report, OPEN\u2019s executive director, Ben Brandzel, bragged that OPEN ran \u201ca Canadian campaign that moved the needle during the 2015 national election, contributing greatly to the ousting of the Conservative Harper government.\u201d On the basis of that and other evidence, I (and others) made detailed submissions about Leadnow to Elections Canada. After a 17-month investigation during 2017 and 2018, nothing illegal was found.\n\nBy scaring investors away from Canada, activism is diverting billions of investment dollars into the U.S. where the oil industry is booming\n\nIn 2011, Brandzel came to Canada and helped launch Leadnow. For years, his Facebook profile said, perhaps jokingly, \u201cI can see the Golden Gate from one house and the Washington Monument from the other. And I spend a lot of time interloping in the affairs of foreign nations.\u201d Shortly after Elections Canada opened its investigation, that sentence was removed.\n\nU.S. tax returns show that during its early years, OPEN received US$257,000 from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the same Rockefeller charity that provided the seed funding and continues to fund the co-ordination of The Tar Sands Campaign against Canadian oil.\n\nIronically, the effect of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund\u2019s activism is not to reduce overall world oil production but to shift more of that production to the American monopoly that has Canada over a barrel. By scaring investors away from Canada, activism is diverting billions of investment dollars into the U.S. where the oil industry is booming.\n\nWho funds Leadnow? That\u2019s a mystery since Leadnow has not made public any of its financial statements since 2016. Financial statements for 2013-2015 show that Leadnow had total revenue of $3.7 million over three years.\n\nLeadnow has said that it is funded by at least 2,000 Canadian donors. But how did Leadnow get those donors? Stratcom, a company with close ties to the San Francisco-based Tides Foundation, says it generated Leadnow\u2019s initial cohort of 1,800 donors. The Tides Foundation is the hub of The Tar Sands Campaign, and has made more than 400 payments to at least 100 organizations involved in the U.S., Canada and in Europe.\n\nWho is OPEN, the U.S. organization that is behind Leadnow?\n\nOPEN calls itself a \u201cbusiness to business\u201d (\u201cB2B\u201d) organization. According to Brandzel, OPEN intentionally keeps a \u201cvery low public profile\u201d because, as he puts it, \u201cthe political implications of an international association can be sensitive in some of the countries in which we work.\u201d No kidding. What OPEN does should be illegal during elections.\n\nOPEN\u2019s member groups \u201cconnect virtually through thousands of messages every month and live web seminars.\u201d \u201cWe gather physically at regular global and regional summits and through international staff exchanges. Over 120 such visits have occurred since 2014,\u201d OPEN says.\n\nPhotos show that in 2012, Leadnow went to a strategic planning retreat with the Rockefeller Brothers Fund in New York. In January of 2016, Leadnow\u2019s Amara Possian attended an OPEN summit in Australia where Leadnow won an award for its 2015 campaign to help defeat the Conservatives. Logan McIntosh, Leadnow\u2019s executive director, went to Australia during its 2016 election and worked with Get-Up, another member of OPEN.\n\nAccording to OPEN\u2019s website, Leadnow is still a member and yet in all Leadnow\u2019s tweets and Facebook posts, there is not one single mention of OPEN.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: there\u2019s nothing wrong with Leadnow being part of an international network of progressive organizations. But, no pun intended, this needs to be out in the open.\n\nTwitter.com/FairQuestions\n\nVivian Krause is a Vancouver-based researcher and writer.
