Case closed.", "language": "en", "text": "He told her he\u2019d fudged a few things at his travel office for the stranger \u2014 buying him an extra ticket and changing his return dates on an existing one. And he was nervous it could cost him his job.\n\nElaine Dorsey shook her head and let it go. He was always doing something nice for others. And she didn\u2019t think he\u2019d get fired for it.\n\nAD\n\nJimmy Dorsey didn\u2019t get fired, but he did change the course of an entire family\u2019s life \u2014 and maybe even an entire field of science \u2014 thanks to his generosity that day.\n\nAD\n\nThe stranger was Mahmoud Ghannoum, a renowned scientist who is now known as the world\u2019s leading microbiome researcher. (Whenever you read about gut bacteria or probiotics? That\u2019s Ghannoum\u2019s work.)\n\nGhannoum was in Washington for a scientific conference in 1990, and he was in trouble.\n\nHis country, Kuwait, had just been invaded by Saddam Hussein. His city was in scorched-earth ruin, and his young family was squatting in a dorm room in England while he tried to find work and a way to get them all to the United States.\n\nAD\n\nBut the people who could help him find work wouldn\u2019t be in the District until the next weekend. He had neither the money to stay there, nor the means to change his plane ticket.\n\nSo he ducked into a travel agency and told his story.\n\nThe travel agent in charge that day listened to this story from this Muslim man with a mustache, a thick accent and a brown suit.\n\nAD\n\nAnd he didn\u2019t turn him away.\n\nHe found a way for Ghannoum to be in D.C. the following weekend, with some keyboard clicks and a new plane ticket. And then he opened his wallet and gave him $80 cash. \u201cSo you have some spending money,\u201d he told him.\n\nGhannoum interviewed like a boss and got two job offers.\n\nAD\n\nHe told the story about America\u2019s open arms for 30 years as he wrote papers, made discoveries and became a force in American science.\n\nBut he also never got to thank the man. The travel agency began laying off employees and closed for good not long after Ghannoum settled in America, during the 1991 recession.\n\nSo last month, Ghannoum and his son posted something on Facebook, hoping to find their mystery man with little to go on: an African American travel agent in downtown D.C.\n\nI wrote a story about the search.\n\nAD\n\nTips came in and I made lots of calls, checking in with Ghannoum and striking out each time.\n\nThen I heard from Christine Lehnhoff.\n\n\u201cMs Dvorak, I worked as a travel agent in D.C. during that time. My boss, Jimmy Dorsey, was a black man, and our office was near Farragut Square,\u201d she wrote, after reading the story. She remembered he was a firefighter.\n\nAD\n\nSo I found a James Dorsey who worked at the Leesburg Volunteer Fire Company and was a veteran of the Vietnam War.\n\nI sent Ghannoum the photo of 2019 Dorsey. But he wasn\u2019t so sure it was his angel. Squinting, he said \u201cmaybe 30 years ago. But I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d\n\nAnd I worried we would never know.\n\nDorsey died in February at 69, just seven months before Ghannoum, who is also 69, began his search.\n\nI left a message for his widow, Elaine. And so did Ghannoum\u2019s son, Afif Ghannoum.\n\nAD\n\nShe remembered that night her husband came home short of cash with some crazy story about a guy who needed help.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t out of the norm for him to do something like this,\u201d she told me, after she connected all the dots, talked with Afif and was convinced her husband was Ghannoum\u2019s good Samaritan.\n\nAD\n\nBut there was still the matter of the photos. Ghannoum didn\u2019t recognize the salt-and-pepper-bearded Dorsey of 2019, the man who had been fighting liver and lung cancer for a decade. They were both 39 on that travel agency day.\n\nSo Elaine sent the family older pictures of Dorsey, young and fit in Vietnam, with his postwar Afro and white suit in the 1970s, with his close-cropped hair and coach clothes in the 1990s.\n\n\u201cOh my God, it\u2019s him,\u201d Ghannoum said. \u201cIt\u2019s him, 100 percent. I\u2019ll never forget him.\u201d\n\nThe Dorseys and the Ghannoums have been on the phone all week, planning to meet next month. They each told me they have a surprise for the other. (I\u2019ll stay mum on that for now, but we\u2019ll be back with details when they meet.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYes, it\u2019s bittersweet that the men will never get to shake hands or hug, that a man-to-man thank you will never happen.\n\nBut Elaine said she\u2019s satisfied that the story will live on, that her sweet husband\u2019s impulsive act of kindness produced good in the world.\n\nAnd that it may inspire others to be kind.\n\nWe all thank you, Jimmy Dorsey.\n\nRead more Petula Dvorak:\n\nAD", "description": "A Muslim refugee needed help.
