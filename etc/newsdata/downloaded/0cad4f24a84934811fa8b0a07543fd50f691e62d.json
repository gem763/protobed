All but three Democrats voted to support the measure, meaning the bill could have passed the House without any GOP \"yea\" votes.\n\nKAVANAUGH IMPEACHMENT CALLS MARK LATEST STRIKE ON 'JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE,' REPUBLICANS SAY\n\nThe Senate is expected to approve the package next week, meaning fights over funding for President Trump's border wall and possible restrictions on appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security restrictions over the treatment of migrants.\n\nIf the bill is enacted, lawmakers would have until Nov. 21 to negotiate and approve $1.4 trillion for federal agencies. Those bills would fill in the details of this summer's budget and debt agreement between Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n\nDEMS LAUNCH LONGSHOT BID FOR DC STATEHOOD AT RARE HEARING, AS REPUBLICANS HAMMER LOCAL CORRUPTION\n\nThe House-passed measure also extends some expiring federal programs and replenishes Trump's bailout of farmers who've been hurt by the U.S. trade dispute with China.
