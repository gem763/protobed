But video footage of the incident taken by a witness shows Slager shooting Scott in the back as he sprinted away from the officer.\n\nSlager was then criticised for trying to stage a scene to back up his claim of self-defence, by placing his stun gun beside Scott.\n\nHe was arrested three days after the video surfaced, a rare case of quick action in cases of police killings.\n\nThe incident sparked angry demonstrations.\n\n\"Officers who violate anyone's rights also violate their oaths of honour, and they tarnish the names of the vast majority of officers, who do incredible work,\" Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement.\n\n\"Those who enforce our laws must also abide by them - and this Department of Justice will hold accountable anyone who violates the civil rights of our fellow Americans.\"\n\nThe executive director of the South Carolina chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, Shaundra Scott, said her organisation and others were working with police in the wake of the Scott case to ensure officer accountability.\n\nForgiveness and anger\n\nRelatives of the victim said on Thursday they forgave Slager, despite their grief.\n\n\"Forgiveness came easy for (others). It came very hard for me,\" said Scott's older brother, Anthony.\n\n\"At the end of the day, there's another judge he has to face.\"\n\nStill, some family members insisted Slager pay a heavy price for the shooting.\n\n\"He will never see me play high school football, never see me graduate,\" Scott's son Miles said in court on Wednesday. \"My heart is destroyed because the way my father went was wrong.\"\n\nBefore the end of Thursday's sentencing hearing, Slager addressed the court, saying he was grateful for the Scott family's forgiveness.\n\n\"I wish this never would have happened,\" said Slager.\n\n\"I wish I could go back in time to change the events. I can't.\"\n\n", "description": "A white former US cop has been sentenced to 20 years in prison over the fatal shooting of an unarmed black motorist - a case that sparked mass protests and anger over excessive use of force by police.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1726/584cdb32b0544dc7b063aaa6bfd30b24.jpg", "published_at": "2017-12-08"}
