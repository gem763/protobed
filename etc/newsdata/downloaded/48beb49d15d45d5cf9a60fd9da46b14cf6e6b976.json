Now, that possibility has gone from being a laughable impossibility to a just barely conceivable long shot.\n\nIt\u2019s a plausible if still unlikely path, because so many Republican senators have either been silent or responded to recent events with word salads that provide Trump with little comfort. It\u2019s also plausible because a sizable minority of the Republican rank and file are abandoning the president. A Post-Schar School poll last week found 28 percent of Republicans supporting the House impeachment inquiry, while an astonishing 18 percent said they favored removing Trump from office. Mr. I-Only-Care-About-the-Base must be petrified that a chunk of that base doesn\u2019t care about him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump has never been in as weak a position as he finds himself in now. This helps explain the scorched-earth letter from White House counsel Pat Cipollone on Tuesday effectively telling one popularly elected house of Congress to go stuff it. In what New York magazine\u2019s Jonathan Chait described as a \u201cderanged, quasi-legal rant,\u201d Cipollone ludicrously said the House inquiry \u201clacks any legitimate constitutional foundation.\u201d\n\nThe president is aware that if he loses too many Republicans, he loses everything. He thus moved Wednesday morning to cast the fight entirely in partisan terms. \u201cThe Do Nothing Democrats are Con Artists, only looking to hurt the Republican Party and President,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cTheir total focus is 2020, nothing more, and nothing less. The good news is that WE WILL WIN!!!!\u201d Presumably he hopes those capital letters and four exclamation points will inspire his one-time allies to put their blinders back on.\n\nHe also wants to remind Republican senators, especially those from states where he is strong, that he can cause them a lot of pain. Assuming the House votes for impeachment, Trump needs 34 senators to block his removal from office. And exactly 34 senators come from states where he secured 56 percent of the vote or more in 2016. Three of them are Democrats, which would bring him down to 31 if only Republicans support him. But then add in the four Republicans from South Carolina and Texas, and the number is at 35.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s hardly a comfortable margin, but it\u2019s enough. Those 35 are Trump\u2019s front line, and it\u2019s why nasty, angry hyperpartisanship will be at the heart of everything he does from now on.\n\nThis number must also be on the minds of House Democrats. It defines how steep the climb toward Trump\u2019s removal will be. This means they have to keep a steady eye on the impact of everything they do on November 2020 and the judgments that people far from the nation\u2019s capital will be making.\n\nNo matter how much Trump baits them, congressional Democrats have to combine toughness with sobriety. Given Trump\u2019s patent abuses, the facts are their friends. The nation, judging from the polls, is moving in their direction. This is not the result of any flights of rhetorical genius or brilliant political strategy. It\u2019s happening because the more voters (including Republicans) know about what Trump actually did, the more they realize how unfit he is to be president. The higher the ratio of facts to rhetoric, the worse it is for Trump.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe surely knows this, which is why he is trying to starve the inquiry of further information. He wants a fight over process to obscure his actions. He hopes to cast himself as defender of the voters\u2019 \u2014 or, more precisely, the electoral college\u2019s \u2014 2016 will.\n\nOf course House Democrats must fight Trump\u2019s obstruction. But they cannot let him entangle them in abstruse debates over procedures. Their legitimate anger over the corrupt absurdity of the president\u2019s claims should not move them toward theatrical excesses that will only give Trump more openings for deflection and evasion.\n\nAnd they must bear in mind that the final jury in The People v. Trump is still more likely to be an informed electorate than a supine and fearful U.S. Senate.\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "For congressional Democrats, facts are their friends.", "authors": ["E.J.
