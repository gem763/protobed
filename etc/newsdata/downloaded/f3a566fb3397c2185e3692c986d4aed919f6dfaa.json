Now It\u2019s Tearing Them Apart.", "language": "en", "text": "Jacqueline Sackler was fed up. HBO\u2019s John Oliver would soon use his TV show to pillory her family, the clan that owns Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin. In a nearly 15-minute Sunday-night segment, he joined a long line of people who blamed the Sacklers in part for the nation\u2019s opioid crisis.\n\nBefore the show aired, Ms. Sackler, who is married to a son of a company co-founder, emailed her in-laws, lawyers and advisers. \u201cThis situation is destroying our work, our friendships, our reputation and our ability to function in society,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cAnd worse, it dooms my children. How is my son supposed to apply to high school in September?\u201d\n\nThe Sackler family, with its competing branches, has long been fractious. The arrival of nearly 2,000 lawsuits accusing its company of helping to spark a public-health crisis in America has forced the family to a crossroads as it weighs the future of a company that helped make its members wealthy.\n\nFor years the Sacklers avoided being publicly linked to the opioid crisis and OxyContin, a prescription painkiller containing a morphine derivative called oxycodone. They cultivated an image as global philanthropists, donating millions to New York\u2019s Metropolitan Museum of Art, Columbia University and scores of other institutions both in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe Sackler Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nThe host of lawsuits, some of which name as defendants many individual Sacklers who served on Purdue\u2019s board, has unraveled the family\u2019s standing in philanthropic, academic and financial circles. Family members have been leaving the boards of nonprofits. Prestigious museums and universities are rejecting their donations. Some investment funds are returning their money.\n\nThe backlash has intensified infighting among family members, whose disagreements have threatened efforts to resolve the litigation, according to emails reviewed by The Wall Street Journal and to interviews with dozens of current and former Purdue employees and people who have spoken with the Sacklers.\n\nFor years, family members argued over matters large and small, from corporate strategy to board-meeting agendas. Often the conflicts were between the two sides of the family that equally control the closely held Stamford, Conn., company\u2014co-founding brothers Mortimer Sackler and Raymond Sackler and their heirs.\n\nIn the current legal melee, family members disagreed on the strategy for settling a lawsuit with the state of Oklahoma and on how to respond to media requests. Members of the Mortimer side wanted a member of the other side to express remorse over derogatory comments that person once made about addicts.\n\nFor some family members, dealing with the mounting litigation and its fallout is consuming most of their time, said people who speak with them. Several Sacklers have retreated from public life.\n\nIn the New York philanthropic and arts circles in which some Sacklers moved, \u201cit\u2019s a topic of some gossip around town that there are ruptures in the family and that they are people struggling to deal with this wave of bad news and throngs of litigation,\u201d said Euan Rellie, an investment banker who knows some of the Sacklers socially.\n\nSackler family members contacted for this article referred questions to spokespeople. The two family branches said in a joint statement they support efforts to work together, along with Purdue and other stakeholders, to find solutions to the opioid crisis.\n\nAsked about various matters by the Journal, they said: \u201cThis story paints a very misleading and inaccurate picture of our families, our views and approach to this litigation.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuits by cities, states and Native American tribes allege Purdue misled the public and physicians about the addictive nature of OxyContin, which Purdue began selling in 1996. The company and eight family members who are named in some of the suits have denied the allegations. In previous written statements and legal filings, they have noted that OxyContin was approved by regulators and said its prescriptions have made up a small percentage of all opioids and the company\u2019s marketing was appropriate.\n\nOxyContin pills Photo: Toby Talbot/Associated Press\n\nThey have said they are united in wanting to resolve all of the opioid litigation. Meanwhile, Purdue Pharma is struggling with weakening sales and restructuring challenges.\n\nPurdue Pharma LP\u2019s roots trace to 1952, when three Sackler brothers, all psychiatrists, acquired a small predecessor company in New York for $50,000. Raymond and Mortimer bought out the share of the oldest brother, Arthur, after his death in 1987, and Arthur\u2019s heirs weren\u2019t involved in Purdue after that.\n\nPurdue initially made simple products such as laxatives, earwax removers and antiseptics. In 1995 it won U.S. marketing approval for a breakthrough product, OxyContin, an extended-release opioid designed to last 12 hours, to treat moderate-to-severe pain.\n\nThe Sacklers of Purdue The family that owns Purdue Pharma LP has two branches, descended from brothers who founded the company. Some members who served on the board are defendants in some of the lawsuits accusing Purdue of helping spark the opioid crisis. They have denied the allegations. Below are the family\u2019s first and second generations plus one third-generation member who is a defendant.

For OxyContin, it recruited doctors as paid speakers at resort gatherings, helped fund nonprofits focused on pain patients, and blanketed physicians with promotional items such as plush toys shaped like a pill. Decades earlier, Arthur Sackler pioneered methods of drug-industry marketing and, posthumously, was inducted into the Medical Advertising Hall of Fame, which said he \u201chelped shape pharmaceutical promotion as we know it today.\u201d\n\nRaymond and Mortimer, who lived into the 2000s, split control and ownership of the business equally, a structure that made it difficult to resolve disagreements. Other family members were active in the company, and up to 10 of them at a time were on the board of directors. The two sides selected their own nonfamily directors and set their pay under separate guidelines.\n\nBoard meetings were raucous, casual affairs attended by dozens of people, like a \u201cfamily picnic with PowerPoint presentations,\u201d said one former employee. The meetings, held monthly for many years, could go on for days. The longtime corporate counsel usually ran them.\n\nMortimer\u2019s side of the family was known by staff and advisers as the \u201cA Side,\u201d for the share type they owned, and Raymond\u2019s as the \u201cB Side.\u201d Relations between the brothers were strained for years. The brothers sat on opposite sides at board meetings and communicated through intermediaries, said people who attended.\n\nAt one meeting years ago, according to a person who was present, Mortimer tried to punch Raymond but, missing him, hit a company attorney in between.\n\nFormer Purdue Pharma President Richard Sackler Photo: no credit\n\nReasons for the strain are murky, although some people close to the family said Mortimer opposed tapping Raymond\u2019s son Richard Sackler to be president in 1999, a post he held until 2003. Clashes between Richard and two of Mortimer\u2019s children\u2014 Kathe Sackler and Mortimer D.A. Sackler \u2014accounted for much of the sparring at board meetings, according to several people who attended.\n\nOne source of tension was when to take profits from the company. Mortimer\u2019s heirs, who are more numerous, wanted to do so more frequently, while the Raymond side was more inclined to let Purdue reinvest in its business, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\nPurdue has sold more than $35 billion of OxyContin since its introduction. Just since 2007, Purdue has distributed more than $4 billion in profits to its owners, civil complaints have said.\n\nAt times, the family considered selling Purdue. Raymond\u2019s side usually opposed a sale, said people close to the company.\n\nThe Sacklers also often couldn\u2019t agree on the types of assets to buy. The risk-averse board reviewed dozens of potential acquisitions over the years.\n\nOnce, at a meeting held in Europe in 2016, Kathe Sackler commented that the board should assert more authority and wasn\u2019t just a \u201csecretariat.\u201d Cousin Jonathan Sackler, from the Raymond side, cracked an expletive-laden joke about whether she meant the Triple Crown-winning racehorse, said people who were there. Kathe demanded an apology, they said.\n\nFrom the beginning of OxyContin sales, Purdue deployed hundreds of sales representatives to call on physicians and try to persuade them to write more OxyContin prescriptions. It had a bonus system that was considered the most lucrative in the industry, according to former sales reps and a 2003 U.S. General Accounting Office report.\n\nThe GAO report was subtitled \u201cOxyContin Abuse and Diversion and Efforts to Address the Problem.\u201d It quoted a revised label, approved in 2001, that said OxyContin had been reported as being abused \u201cby crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product.\u201d Food and Drug Administration officials said they didn\u2019t anticipate that abuse would become widespread, the report said.\n\nShare Your Thoughts How much responsibility, if any, do you think the makers of prescription opioid pharmaceuticals bear for the addiction crisis? Join the conversation below.\n\nIn 2007, Purdue and three executives who weren\u2019t family members pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges of misleading the public about OxyContin\u2019s addictiveness between 1995 and 2001. They agreed to $634.5 million in penalties, and Purdue signed a five-year corporate-integrity agreement with the U.S. government. In 2013, the U.S. said Purdue had met the agreement\u2019s requirements.\n\nAt least one in-house Purdue lawyer saw the 2007 pleas as a way to protect former president Richard Sackler from legal exposure, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nIn a written statement to the Journal, Purdue said it pleaded guilty to resolve the probe and accept responsibility for \u201cmisconduct committed by certain of Purdue\u2019s supervisors and employees,\u201d and that it is \u201cwrong to assert that the purpose of the guilty plea was to protect Richard Sackler\u201d or anyone else.\n\nRaymond\u2019s heirs, in a separate written statement, called suggestions that the 2007 agreement was meant to protect any family member \u201clies.\u201d\n\nAfter the pleas, the company and family regarded their OxyContin legal problems as behind them. But about a decade later, municipalities affected by opioid addiction, which has taken roughly 218,000 lives in the U.S. over two decades, began filing lawsuits accusing Purdue and several other drugmakers and distributors of creating a health crisis.\n\nMost of the suits have been consolidated in federal court in Ohio, where companies and the plaintiffs have been working for more than a year on reaching a settlement.\n\nSince 2010, Purdue has sold OxyContin in a form designed to be harder to abuse. Early last year, Purdue stopped promoting the drug and cut remaining members of its sales force. The last family member on the Purdue board left this year.\n\nThe Sacklers continue to own the company through family trusts and will need to agree on its future, including whether this should include a bankruptcy filing, an idea the company has considered for several months.\n\nOpioids by the Numbers OxyContin is a time-release version of prescription pain treatment oxycodone, an opioid that has existed for decades. In 2010, Purdue launched a version of OxyContin that is designed to be harder to abuse. OxyContin\u2019s share of total U.S. oxycodone prescriptions has been in decline since 2010. OxyContin Other brands 25 million 20 15 10 5 0 2006 \u201908 \u201910 \u201912 \u201914 \u201916 \u201918 However, OxyContin makes up more than 70% of oxycodone sales in the U.S. OxyContin Other brands $4 billion 3 2 1 0 2006 \u201908 \u201910 \u201912 \u201914 \u201916 \u201918 U.S. prescription-opioid-overdose deaths 17,500 15,000 2017: 17,029 12,500 10,000 7,500 5,000 2,500 0 2006 \u201908 \u201910 \u201912 \u201914 \u201916\n\nThe Sacklers are addressing these questions the same way they control Purdue: on separate tracks. Each side of the family has its own law firm and its own public-relations firm, as does the company. While both sides have said they want to reach a deal that would give them finality in the litigation, until recently Raymond\u2019s side was more interested in fighting the allegations, according to several people familiar with the matter.\n\nOne disagreement came in late March, shortly before Purdue said it would settle with Oklahoma for $270 million. Attorney David Bernick, representing Raymond\u2019s heirs, was concerned that settling might encourage other plaintiffs to seek similar amounts and wanted Purdue to file for bankruptcy reorganization instead, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe family ultimately agreed that settling would let Purdue avoid an approaching trial date and have time to possibly settle more cases and do a restructuring through a bankruptcy filing. Mr. Bernick declined to discuss a client matter.\n\nFamily members disagreed on how to respond to media inquiries about emails Richard Sackler sent as president, made public in lawsuits this year. In one 2001 email, he wrote: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you something that will totally revise your belief that addicts don\u2019t want to be addicted. It is factually untrue. They get themselves addicted over and over again.\u201d\n\nMortimer\u2019s son Mortimer D.A. Sackler and his wife, Jacqueline Sackler, found such notes embarrassing and were horrified when they became public, according to people who spoke with the couple. They were among family members who wanted Richard, the former Purdue president, to go beyond calling the emails insensitive and to express remorse for them.\n\nRichard\u2019s son, David, supported doing this for one media inquiry but didn\u2019t believe that John Oliver\u2019s HBO show in April was an appropriate forum for such a statement, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nRichard recently said in a deposition and through a spokesman that he has learned more about addiction and has compassion for addicts.\n\nJacqueline Sackler and Mortimer D.A. Sackler Photo: Nicholas Hunt / PatrickMcMullan.com\n\nSome Sacklers who aren\u2019t involved with Purdue have singled out Richard for blame. Arthur Sackler Jr. , son of the brother who died before OxyContin\u2019s introduction, got into a heated argument with Richard late last year in a conference room at company headquarters, accusing him of tarnishing the family name, according to two people familiar with the exchange.\n\nThere is one thing on which the family appears united: a belief they aren\u2019t responsible for fueling the addiction crisis, according to internal emails and interviews with people who have spoken with the Sacklers.\n\nRaymond\u2019s heirs generally believe the company may have made some mistakes nearly two decades ago, and blame former executives, but think family members shouldn\u2019t be held responsible years later, according to people who have spoken with them. They regret they weren\u2019t more proactive in stating the family\u2019s belief they aren\u2019t responsible for the opioid crisis.\n\nFor Ilene Sackler Lefcourt, a daughter of Mortimer, the litigation and scrutiny are a distraction from her work running a child-parent mental-health nonprofit, according to a friend, Patricia Nachman. \u201cShe says, \u2018It\u2019s not that we did everything right, but it\u2019s not at the magnitude that it seems to be in the press,\u2019 \u201d said Dr. Nachman.\n\nJacqueline Sackler, in the email she sent before the John Oliver show in April, wrote that \u201cI have yet to see anything illegal or even immoral that this company has done. I\u2019ve seen distasteful and disrespectful.\u201d\n\nMs. Sackler criticized the family\u2019s communications strategy and said she was through serving as the nation\u2019s punching bag. She expressed concern about how the criticism of the Sacklers was affecting her family. \u201cLives of children are being destroyed,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u2014Jim Oberman and Elisa Cho contributed to this article.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nJacqueline Sackler\u2019s email was sent before John Oliver\u2019s HBO show aired. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated it was sent afterward. In addition, investment banker Euan Rellie\u2019s surname was misspelled as Reille in an earlier version of this article.
