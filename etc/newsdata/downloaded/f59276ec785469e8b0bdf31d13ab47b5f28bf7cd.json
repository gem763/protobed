It\u2019s a cute little camera that clicks into your iPhone\u2019s Lightning port and takes 360-degree photos and videos. The camera itself is very compact and can easily be held in the palm of your hand or slipped into your pocket.\n\nI\u2019m fairly new to 360 cameras. I generally shoot using my Canon 7D DSLR or Fujifilm X-T10, and this is an entirely new experience altogether. Instead of concentrating on framing a particular shot, you can just click the shutter button and worry about framing later, so it\u2019s good if you\u2019re on the go and don\u2019t want to think too much. The most engaging experience the camera offers is that it places you in the center of your environment: it captures where you are and what a particular place looked like at a particular moment in time.\n\nLooking back at the photos I took, what really stands out are the pieces that perhaps you didn\u2019t notice or intend to capture. There are many small details that stand out \u2014 from the mundane receipts on the table to ground coffee beans and the patterns on wooden panels at the markets. It\u2019s special in its own way, because memories fog up over time, and having something like this while you\u2019re on holiday could literally bring you back to that moment when you were, for example, feeding pigeons in Piazza San Marco. The camera also does a decent job of capturing your whole body, though it does have a fish-eye like distortion.\n\nThe camera is simple to use \u2014 you just click it in and open the Insta360 Nano S app, which takes a couple of seconds to load. The app opens to the camera screen, where you can use your finger to move the viewfinder around in any direction to see what the 360 capture will look like.\n\nFor me personally, this camera would be great for traveling and in particular places that have lots of details I\u2019d want to remember, like theme parks or something like the Harry Potter Studio tour here in London. Daytime shots came out fine, though the camera does struggle in low light conditions, especially when I took it out for a jaunt at night.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only other qualm I have is that the photos, when cropped to a particular part of the 360 capture, aren\u2019t as high in quality as I had expected and can be a little pixelated at times. It is fine though, if you\u2019re just posting to the web or social media. (The Nano S shoots 20MP photos and 4K video).\n\nThe camera comes equipped with Instagram-like filters that are applied in real time, and a beauty mode that smooths out complexions and allows you to control how strongly it\u2019s applied. Other customization options include stickers, and choosing different angles and layout when sharing your photos to social media. One odd thing, though, is the camera automatically erases your phone from the photo so it looks like you\u2019re holding nothing.\n\nThere\u2019s also a 360 call feature available in beta, but when I tested it out, it worked fine. When you select the option, the app generates a link for you to send to the person you want to call. Once they click on it, the call starts. It\u2019s essentially the same as a regular video call except you have the option of sliding your finger around the screen to see what part of the surroundings you want the other person to see. There\u2019s also a MultiView option that divides the screen into different configurations and you can choose different angles to display simultaneously.\n\nThat said, the camera really seems to be built for social media because it\u2019s super easy to use, plus editing and sharing can be done directly from your phone. That\u2019s an advantage over something like a GoPro, where you might need to upload the photos onto a computer (or deal with a wireless pairing process) before posting online. It\u2019s up to your preference and what kind of photos you want, but the Nano S just captures it all and is good for landscape shots or showing off where you are without hassle. It\u2019s a camera I\u2019d most likely use while I\u2019m traveling. But if you\u2019re into selfies and outfit photos, it could also serve as a handy workaround instead of, say, asking your insta-boyfriend.\n\nThe Nano S is available now for $239.", "description": "The Nano S is a neat 360 camera for traveling that slides into your iPhone\u2019s lightning port", "authors": ["Thuy Ong", "Feb"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NGNiH-U6gS2XCSLm53hn_ZDgJq0=/0x82:2040x1150/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10226133/tong_180214_2305_0003.jpg", "published_at": "2018-02-17"}
