(Steven Senne/AP)\n\nThe woman accusing Antonio Brown of rape and sexual assault is scheduled to meet Monday with NFL representatives, according to a person close to the situation.\n\nThe league\u2019s interview with Britney Taylor will be a key part of its investigation of the allegations, made by Taylor in a lawsuit in Florida. Brown has denied the allegations through his attorney.\n\nNFL investigators also are seeking to interview other potential witnesses and are gathering other information, people familiar with the case have said. League officials hope to be in position soon to make a determination about whether to place Brown on paid leave via the commissioner\u2019s exempt list. The NFL opted last week not to make a decision on that issue before this weekend\u2019s games.\n\nThat left the wide receiver eligible to play for his new team, the New England Patriots, Sunday at Miami.\n\n[Antonio Brown eligible to play Sunday for Patriots]\n\nAn attorney for Taylor declined to comment on the scheduling of the meeting.\n\nMultiple people familiar with the case have said it remains possible that the NFL will place Brown on the exempt list, which would make him ineligible to play for and practice with the Patriots, and that the league hopes to make its decision soon. It\u2019s not clear, however, whether the decision will be made this coming week.\n\nBrown has not been charged with a crime. However, the NFL\u2019s personal conduct policy empowers Commissioner Roger Goodell to place Brown on the exempt list if he believes after an investigation that the policy may have been violated.\n\nThe league-owned NFL Network first reported that the meeting with Taylor had been scheduled for Monday.\n\nRead more:\n\nSaints-Rams, Eagles-Falcons and Antonio Brown\u2019s Patriots debut highlight Week 2 NFL schedule\n\nShorthanded Redskins look for first win against Cowboys in home opener\n\nHow the Saints-Rams no-call changed the NFL\n\nThe Raiders, believe it or not, are starting to look like a competent NFL team\n\nTorrey Smith retires from NFL, thanking football \u2018for being my way out\u2019", "description": "League officials hope to be in position soon to make a determination about whether to place Brown on paid leave via the commissioner\u2019s exempt list.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl", "September At Am", "Mark Maske Covers The Nfl For The Washington Post.
