(Mark Lennihan/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nBloomberg reports: \u201cHunter Biden is stepping down from the board of a Chinese-backed private equity company and promising to forgo all foreign work if his father, former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, is elected president in 2020.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden and his father are the victims of a smear campaign by the most corrupt president in history, who falsely alleges that Joe Biden intervened in Ukraine to protect his son who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma. (\u201cTrump has alleged that Vice President Biden in 2016 threatened to withhold billions of dollars in loan guarantees unless Ukraine fired the country\u2019s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, as a way to quash the probe and help his son. But U.S. and Ukrainian officials said the investigation at the time was dormant and that Shokin was fired for the opposite reason: failing to fight corruption.\u201d)\n\nHunter Biden is taking a step that no other prospective presidential adult child in recent memory has undertaken. Moreover \u2014 and here is the most grossly underreported story of the Trump years \u2014 the Trump clan, even those working in the administration, continue to make a mint trading on their father\u2019s name.\n\nBloomberg notes:\n\nBiden\u2019s pledge to avoid foreign work if his father wins the White House sets him apart from Trump\u2019s children, who have continued working with foreign business partners from Dubai to Indonesia and India while his father sits in the White House. After Trump won the presidency in 2016, he handed the running of the Trump Organization to his sons, Don Jr. and Eric, and said they wouldn\u2019t do any new overseas deals.\n\nThey still make money overseas, as the New York Times recently reported: \u201cBoth sons have operated and promoted the Trump family business overseas during their father\u2019s presidency, even as he retains ownership.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner work in the White House without divesting themselves of business holdings or forgoing foreign transactions, thereby raising the possibility in the minds of foreign leaders that the two can be manipulated. The Post reported in February 2018: \u201cOfficials in at least four countries have privately discussed ways they can manipulate Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, by taking advantage of his complex business arrangements, financial difficulties and lack of foreign policy experience.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump unconstitutionally receives the benefits of foreign deals and refuses to release his tax returns that would reveal sources of income. And we\u2019re supposed to be concerned that Hunter Biden, whose father is no longer in office, is serving on a Chinese company\u2019s board? Something is terribly wrong with this picture.\n\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has been among the most vocal defenders of the Bidens (Democratic candidates who prefer to lie low and reap the benefit of Trump\u2019s attacks against their primary opponents behave shamefully), made the point with exceptional clarity on CNN\u2019s State of the Union:\n\n.@PeteButtigieg: \"Even though there's been no accusation of wrongdoing, [Hunter Biden's] doing something just to make sure there's not even the appearance of a conflict of interest, while in the White House the president of the United States is a walking conflict of interest.\" pic.twitter.com/38OyWhZWkK \u2014 Andrew Bates \ud83e\udd41 (@AndrewBatesNC) October 13, 2019\n\nThe media need to press Trump and his children \u2014 and Congress should be investigating and subpoenaing records \u2014 to reveal all foreign sources of income for Ivanka and Jared and all foreign business activity by Eric and Donald Trump Jr. Perhaps the House should pass legislation specifically barring adult children of the president from engaging in any foreign business dealings. Ivanka and Jared need to divest from their business holdings or leave the White House. Period.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign has yet to call for the Trump children to take the same pledge as Hunter Biden, but it really should consider going on offense. Ivanka, Jared, Eric and Donald Trump Jr. are the poster children for familial corruption. We do not know whether actions Trump takes (e.g., abandoning the Kurds at the behest of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan) are taken to further the family finances. (They sure don\u2019t benefit U.S. national security.) We don\u2019t know how much money they all reap from foreign businesses and whether they engage in foreign business dealings as they travel on the taxpayer\u2019s dime.\n\nTuesday\u2019s debate is the perfect forum for Democrats to end the double standard that serves to shelter the Trump clan from scrutiny for continuing to perpetrate massive conflicts and self-dealing while targeting Joe Biden and his son, who have done the right thing in promising to raise the bar on ethics if Biden wins. It would be a good idea for all the Democratic candidates to promise that their own adult children will follow Hunter Biden\u2019s example. Most important, it is time to shame the media and Congress into investigating the corruption going on as we speak. Ivanka, Jared, Eric and Donald Trump Jr. have been given the kid glove treatment by the media and Congress (the latter for fear of generating sympathy for the Trump offspring!). That needs to end.\n\nRead more:\n\nJoe Biden: Trump won\u2019t destroy me, and he won\u2019t destroy my family\n\nHelaine Olen: Democrats must keep talking about Jared Kushner\u2019s incompetence\n\nJennifer Rubin: Nepotism rules exist for a reason.
