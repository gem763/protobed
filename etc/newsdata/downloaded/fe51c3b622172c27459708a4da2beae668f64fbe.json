Mayfield grew frustrated when Grossi questioned what he believed was a lack of urgency from the offense:\n\nThe full exchange begins at the 7:18 mark:\n\nMayfield addressed the situation on Twitter:\n\nDown 17-7, the Browns got the ball to their own 39-yard line with 32 seconds left before Mayfield was sacked on 1st-and-10 for a loss of 10 yards. Then a false-start penalty moved them back five more yards, ending any hope of scoring before halftime.\n\nOnce Mayfield was sacked, it's hard to argue Cleveland had any option other than to run down the clock. The Patriots defense had already intercepted Mayfield once and returned a fumble for a touchdown.\n\nBut Mayfield's reaction to the question will likely lead some to wonder whether the Browns are starting to feel the pressure from their disappointing 2-5 start.", "description": "Cleveland Browns  quarterback  Baker Mayfield  had a somewhat testy exchange with a reporter Wednesday that resulted in Mayfield walking away altogether...", "authors": ["Joseph Zucker"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/835/752/hi-res-55bcac122df966dd54b56906135dd127_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
