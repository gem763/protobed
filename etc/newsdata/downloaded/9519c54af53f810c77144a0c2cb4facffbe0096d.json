Now, the performer's daughter, Willow, is following in her mom's footsteps.\n\nPink's husband, Carey Hart, posted a photo on Instagram of Willow getting a one-side-shaved hairdo, similar to one her mom has sported in the past.\n\n\"Loving my punk rock daughter. Remember everyone, fly your own flag,\" he captioned the picture. \"There is no box to be put in. It's better to be your own self. Own it, and love it. And if anyone has a problem with it, tell them (politely) to move on.\"\n\nHe added, \"Can't wait to see the woman you grow up to be. I have a feeling you are gonna be strong, fierce, compassionate, and caring. I\u2019m so proud of you, willow.\"\n\nHart, 44, and Pink, whose given name is Alecia Moore, 40, have been criticized online for posting photos of Willow, 8, and son, Jameson, 2, engaged in activities that the so-called \"parent police\" have deemed unacceptable.\n\nLast month, Pink posted a photo of Willow getting her hair dyed blue, after Jessica Simpson was mommy-shamed for letting her daughter Maxwell get the ends of her hair dyed purple. She added the hashtag \"#ParentPoliceareActuallyJustLonelySadPeople.\" She later disabled her Instagram comments.\n\nPink turned the big 4-0 on Sunday, but now she has something else to celebrate: Her single, \"Walk Me Home,\" just hit No. 1 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart. It's the fifth time she's reached the top of that chart, following \"Try,\" \"Just Give Me a Reason,\" \"Just Like Fire\" and \"What About Us.\"", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
