A new 8-minute Uber helicopter shuttle between Manhattan and John F. Kennedy Airport is expected to cost $200 when it launches next month.\n\nIn the wake of a helicopter crash this week on the roof of a building in Manhattan, some lawmakers want to see a ban on such flights.\n\nAnd some argue it overshadows existing transit reform efforts.\n\nThe bottom line: The market for air taxis is expected to grow from $3.4 billion in 2025 to $17.7 billion by 2040, according to Deloitte, and for newly public Uber, which lost $1 billion in the first quarter of 2019, that opportunity is hard to pass up.\n\n\"We think it\u2019s time to lean forward,\" Khosrowshahi says. \"The business is well positioned to profit. But the next 2, 3, 4 years are going to be about growth.\"\n\nGo deeper:\n\nEditor's note: This piece has been updated to clarify the timing of Uber\u2019s $1 billion loss.", "description": "Uber CEO: \"We really want to move from being a ride-hailing app to essentially being your transportation partner.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/VmWK8qao3tY8fY4cD3o0C0mh2K0=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/06/12/1560343919351.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-12"}
