Open an app, point your phone at a wall, and blank brick or cement becomes a canvas. Create art with digital spraypaint and stencils, and an augmented reality system will permanently store its location and placement, creating the illusion of real street art. If friends or social media followers have the app, they can find your painting on a map and come see it. You might scrawl an in-joke across the door of a friend\u2019s apartment, or paint a gorgeous mural on the side of a local store.\n\nNow imagine a darker world. Members of hate groups gleefully swap pictures of racist tags on civil rights monuments. Students bully each other by spreading vicious rumors on the walls of a target\u2019s house. Small businesses get mobbed beyond capacity when a big influencer posts a sticker on their window. The developers of Mark AR, an app that\u2019s described as \u201cthe world\u2019s first augmented reality social platform,\u201d are trying to create the good version of this system. They\u2019re still figuring out how to avoid the bad one.\n\nMark AR is one of the first projects built on Google\u2019s Persistent Cloud Anchors. The app, created by mobile publisher iDreamSky and Subway Surfers developer Sybo, debuted at last week\u2019s New York Comic-Con, where visitors could borrow a phone and walk through a Mark AR pop-up installation, either viewing professional artwork or creating their own. Talented artists might use a virtual spraycan to paint freehand. Everyone else (including me) could pick from a set of comics-themed stencils. In the future, users could make their own stencils or even design images in Photoshop and import them directly.\n\nMark AR\u2019s first big test will be a single-city launch\n\nMark AR\u2019s creators are planning more pop-up exhibits, and after these small trial runs, they plan to test the app in a single city. \u201cA city launch will be where we\u2019re testing: can we handle the moderation? Can we make sure people are playing safe?\u201d says iDreamSky president Jeff Lyndon. \u201cOnce we can handle a city, we know exactly how we can scale our business to a national launch.\u201d But if existing social networks have taught us anything, it\u2019s that these are massive, complicated \u2014 sometimes even impossible \u2014 questions to answer.\n\nAt launch, Mark AR is supposed to work a bit like Facebook. Users will log in with real names, probably through Facebook itself. When they create art, they can share the location with a single person, a list of friends and followers, or the members of a group. Google\u2019s ARCore platform stores the location using GPS and computer vision, capturing details in the environment to use them as anchor points. When somebody shares art with you, a thumbnail will appear on a map; if you visit that location and point your phone at the place shown in the thumbnail, you\u2019ll see whatever image they\u2019ve created.\n\nThere are lots of potential technical issues, since Cloud Anchors are still very new. But social topics \u2014 like sharing, privacy, and abuse \u2014 are more interesting. Pok\u00e9mon Go, the first successful AR game, raised its share of unexpected questions. Should people be able to catch pok\u00e9mon in the Holocaust Museum? (No.) Could it be illegal to place a digital marker on a person\u2019s real house without permission? (Unclear.) Should app makers worry about their users falling into ponds? (Apparently.)\n\nMark AR faces these issues plus the complications of running a creative platform where anybody can upload content. They\u2019re also one of the first players trying to launch this kind of network as a mainstream product \u2014 although Microsoft will face similar issues with its AR game Minecraft Earth, something the company readily acknowledges.\n\nIt\u2019s taking some lessons from \u2018Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019\n\nMark AR\u2019s creators are taking some cues from Pok\u00e9mon Go \u2014 they\u2019re going to geofence physical spaces like memorials to be off-limits, for instance. And they hope a real-name policy and the friend-based model will limit people making offensive or harassing images. \u201cBecause there\u2019s no anonymity, that helps govern what people are doing,\u201d says Sybo CEO Mathias Gredal Norvig. (It\u2019s unclear how true that is \u2014 Facebook has faced repeated problems with closed groups devoted to swapping non-consensual pornography or degrading women or immigrants.)\n\nLyndon adds that Mark AR will devote resources to addressing abuse. \u201cWe are working on hiring a human moderation team, and we are also working with a few tech companies to provide image recognition \u2014 to provide kind of a moderated machine learning, to just go through some of the images very quickly.\u201d That\u2019s similar to the approach that bigger, purely online social networks have taken. It\u2019s been difficult to scale, though. AI can\u2019t make sophisticated moderation decisions, and human teams are often overworked and sometimes traumatized by constantly viewing awful content. And while iDreamSky and Sybo are both well-established companies, they don\u2019t have the kind of resources that, say, Facebook could throw at the problem.\n\nJust to be clear: Mark AR isn\u2019t equivalent to somebody tagging a building with real graffiti. Users can\u2019t deface or cover up each other\u2019s work. People will have to seek out the digital art. The company can remove paintings at any time. And Mark AR might not end up being much of a public platform. Its creators tout options like letting people decorate private rooms or create scavenger hunts for friends and family. If that happens, moderation might not be a huge issue, assuming the app catches on at all \u2014 which is far from a sure thing.\n\nBut Mark AR\u2019s whole purpose is imitating a public art form. So its most interesting uses involve, well, people making public art. It\u2019s a natural fit for events like comic-cons and music festivals, where visitors come together in a physical space for creative purposes. And the idea of wandering around a city, finding the random tags people have left behind, is fascinating. Can Mark AR build a new augmented reality without falling into the same traps as our current digital worlds? That\u2019s a fascinating question, too.", "description": "Mark AR, a platform for sharing digital art overlaid on the real world, is one of the first applications of Google\u2019s Cloud Anchor technology.
