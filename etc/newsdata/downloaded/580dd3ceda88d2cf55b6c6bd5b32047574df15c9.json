Mueller detailed a series of contacts between Trump's campaign and Russia.\n\nTrump, who is running for re-election next year, has called the Russia investigation a \"witch hunt\" and has repeatedly sought to discredit it. Russia has denied interfering in the election.\n\nBarr, a Trump appointee who is the top U.S. law enforcement official, is personally involved in investigating Trump's complaints that he and his 2016 campaign were improperly targeted by U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n(reporting by Gavin Jones; additional reporting by Domenico Lusi; editing by Jonathan Oatis)", "description": "Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is not concerned about reports that U.S. Attorney General William Barr held secret meetings with Italian intelligence agencies, Conte's office said on Thursday.
