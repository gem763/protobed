Biden and 2016 election interference.\n\nWilliam Taylor, who appeared before lawmakers under a subpoena, said he discovered an \u201cirregular\u201d back channel headed by Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, that pursued a different objective than official foreign policy.\n\n\u201cThe push to make President Zelensky publicly committed to investigations of Burisma and alleged interference in the 2016 election showed how the official foreign policy of the United States was undercut by irregular efforts led by Mr. Giuliani,\u201d he said, referring to the Ukrainian energy company where Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter was on the board of directors.\n\nMr. Taylor became one of Congress\u2019 most anticipated witnesses after text messages between him and former Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker showed him to be concerned about quid pro quo by Mr. Trump.\n\nRep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz of Florida, who was in the room for Mr. Taylor\u2019s opening remarks, and several other Democratic lawmakers said his testimony was one of the most disturbing days in office for them.\n\nCalifornia Democrat Rep. Harley Rouda said his opening statement drew \u201ca lot of sighs and gasps\u201d from the room.\n\nMs. Wasserman-Schultz described his testimony as filling in a giant puzzle with a detailed, comprehensive timeline of events.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like if you had a big 1,000-piece puzzle on the table and these subsequent depositions have really started to fill in pieces where at the beginning it\u2019s not clear how everything is connected,\u201d she said. \u201cThis filled in a lot of pieces of the puzzle.\u201d\n\nMr. Taylor told lawmakers that by mid-July, he was aware that a meeting between the two presidents \u2014 which both Americans and Ukrainians were pushing for \u2014 would not happen unless the Ukrainians cooperated with the investigations. Around the same time, the Office of Management and Budget announced that military aid would be delayed to Ukraine. According to Mr. Taylor, that decision came through Mr. Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney.\n\nBy early September, Mr. Taylor learned from Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, that military aid was also contingent on cooperation with the investigations and that the president wanted Mr. Zelensky to \u201cclear things up\u201d in a CNN interview.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland told me that President Trump told him that he wants President Zelensky to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election,\u201d Mr. Taylor said. \u201cHe said that President Trump wanted President Zelensky \u2018in a public box\u2019 by making a public statement about wording such investigations.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 11, the diplomat learned that military aid had been released to Ukraine, and he spent the following two days trying to confirm with Ukrainian officials that the CNN interview would not happen.\n\nThe White House remained defiant Tuesday and maintained the president did nothing wrong.\n\n\u201cThis is a coordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution. There was no quid pro quo. Today was just more triple hearsay and selective leaks from the Democrats\u2019 politically motivated, closed door, secretive hearings,\u201d press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.\n\nMr. Taylor\u2019s detailed testimony clarified the roles many key players had in the Ukraine incident, particularly then-National Security Adviser John R. Bolton and Mr. Sondland. The ambassador testified before lawmakers last week, reportedly saying that he was directed by the president to work with Mr. Giuliani on Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI walk away with the impression Mr. Sondland is going to have some explaining to do,\u201d said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, Illinois Democrat.\n\nRep. Gerry Connolly, Virginia Democrat, said the need for Mr. Bolton\u2019s testimony becomes \u201cmore compelling\u201d every day.\n\nAn aide to Mr. Bolton testified to Congress that the national security adviser was so alarmed about the effort to pressure Ukraine that he told her to alert White House lawyers.\n\nWhile Democrats were struck by Mr. Taylor\u2019s testimony, Republicans remained in the president\u2019s corner.\n\nOhio Rep. Jim Jordan, one of the president\u2019s top defenders in Congress, did not say if there was any information in Mr. Taylor\u2019s testimony that could exonerate the president but did believe it would legitimize the issues involving Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s information that came out, particularly in this second hour, that underscores the concerns that the president had about Ukraine in general,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile at least one Democrat said Mr. Taylor\u2019s testimony could be game changing for the impeachment inquiry, others were a bit more cautious.\n\n\u201cNone of us want to get ahead of ourselves. There\u2019s a lot more to learn,\u201d Ms. Wasserman-Schultz said.\n\nMr. Taylor was the first witness to come to Capitol Hill this week. Lawmakers are set to hear from the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia and Ukraine Laura Cooper, as well as Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs Philip Reeker.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
