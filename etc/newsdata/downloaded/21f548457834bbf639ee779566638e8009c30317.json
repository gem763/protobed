You should have called me the first time this happened.\"\n\nHowever, a spokesman for Rooney stated it was \"irrefutable\", declaring the leaks came from \"one account, and one account only\".\n\nVardy is reportedly set to hire a forensic expert to prove her innocence.", "description": "Coleen Rooney caused an online sensation on Wednesday as she stated Rebekah Vardy's Instagram account was the source of leaked stories about her", "authors": ["Alex Richards", "Image", "Afp Getty Images", "Pa", "Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20083192.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Jamie-Vardy-and-Rebekah-Vardy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
