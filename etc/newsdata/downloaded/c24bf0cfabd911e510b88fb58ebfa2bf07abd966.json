Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem!\" Mr. Trump wrote.\n\nAnother Fake News story out there - It never ends! Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 19, 2019\n\n\"Knowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \"heavily populated\" call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!\" Mr. Trump continued in a second tweet.\n\nThe report has caused a rift between Congress and the intelligence community. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff issued a subpoena to obtain the whistleblower's complaint \u2013 but Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire is refusing to hand it over.\n\nMaguire said he determined the allegations did not merit \"urgent concern,\" and since they relate to a person outside the intelligence community, he is not required to pass them along to Capitol Hill.\n\nSchiff pointed out that this is the first time a Director of National Intelligence has overruled a determination from the inspector general, and raised concerns that the refusal may be a sign of a cover-up to protect the president.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday after the inspector general appeared before the committee, Schiff said that his committee still does not have access to the report. He said that it was unclear whether \"the White House is directly involved\" in keeping the report private.\n\n\"We do know that they are making some claim that a privilege may apply,\" Schiff said about the White House. \"There are other institutions involved that are preventing us from getting the complaint.\"\n\nSchiff said Sunday on \"Face the Nation\" that it's fair to assume the report involves \"the president, or people around him, or both.\"\n\n", "description": "The Acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, is refusing to hand over the report", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/18/6ae1b962-6589-4519-ad9a-0188f8befe1b/thumbnail/1200x630g2/7e37a40aa8cc318ef8b493455e78d9f7/gettyimages-1169220236.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
