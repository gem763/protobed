The S&P closed at a record, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.49% and Nasdaq COMP, +1.01% also finished higher for the day.\n\nRead: S&P 500 carves out record intraday as third-quarter earnings roll out.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Trump characterized the negotiations as moving faster than expected.\n\n\u201cWe are looking probably to be ahead of schedule to sign a very big portion of the China deal, and we\u2019ll call it phase one but it\u2019s a very big portion,\u201d the president said. \u201cThat would take care of the farmers. It would take care of some of the other things. It will also take care of a lot of the banking needs,\u201d he added. Trump is scheduled to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Chile next month.\n\nIMPEACHMENT AND AL-BAGHDADI\n\nAfter the Sunday announcement that the leader of Islamic State died in a U.S.-led raid in Syria, Trump included in his tweet, \u201cEven killed long sought ISIS murderer, al-Baghdadi. We are stronger than ever before, with GREAT upward potential. Enjoy!\u201d\n\nIn his comments to reporters, Trump suggested House Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe contributed to his decision to withhold notice to congressional leaders before Saturday\u2019s raid on Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Trump told reporters Monday he didn\u2019t inform the so-called \u201cGang of Eight\u201d because \u201cAdam Schiff is the biggest leaker in Washington.\u201d\n\nThe group includes the top Democrat and Republican in both chambers and the chairs and ranking members of the intelligence committees. Schiff, the Democratic chairing the House intelligence committee, is playing a central role in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nEXECUTIVE ORDER AND SLAP AT CHICAGO\n\nAfter speaking in Chicago at the International Association of Chiefs of Police annual conference, Trump signed an executive order setting up a new commission on law enforcement that will study issues including homelessness and substance abuse.\n\nThe president also blasted the city, and Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who skipped the event. \u201cAll over the world they\u2019re talking about Chicago,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAfghanistan is a safe place by comparison.\u201d Trump has often criticized Chicago for its status as a sanctuary city, meaning it refuses to work with federal authorities to round up people living in the U.S. illegally.\n\nJohnson said his boycott was a personal decision. \u201cWith some of our communities under siege, it just doesn\u2019t line up with our city\u2019s core values along with my personal values,\u201d he said Saturday.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this article.\n\nSign up for Trump Today and more MarketWatch newsletters.", "description": "President Donald Trump on Monday celebrated a record high for the S&P 500 index, as he said U.S.-China trade negotiations were ahead of schedule.", "authors": ["Robert Schroeder", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS600_trump__ZG_20191003124826.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
