That appeared to set the tone for the Kings' early focus of attack on the way to winning the battle of points in the paint, 40-32.\n\nWare scored only 10 points, but was ably supported by Brad Newley (18), Kevin Lisch (nine points and six assists), Daniel Kickert (16) and Jae'Sean Tate (16), who bullied his way inside for close-range buckets and rebounds in traffic.\n\nAndrew Bogut played just 13 minutes and finished with eight points and four rebounds.\n\nFor the 36ers, Randle finished with 16 points, while Daniel Johnson scored a game-high 26.\n\nThe Kings set up a 22-point lead early in the second quarter with strong defence and never looked back. They were relentless, but the 36ers also looked disjointed on both ends.\n\nThe Kings also finished with a decisive rebounding edge, 46-36.\n\nThe Kings next play the New Zealand Breakers on Friday night in Sydney. The 36ers must regroup before hosting Brisbane next week.", "description": "Jerome Randle returned to Sydney to face his old team, but there was no sweet homecoming as the Kings secured a 102-80 win against Adelaide in their home...", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
