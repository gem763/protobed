But the question is how to do that. We need to have conversations with partners, conversations with leaders and communities to make sure we\u2019re getting that compensation right,\u201d Trudeau told reporters on Friday \u2013 adding that such talks could not take place during the current election campaign.\n\nThe ruling could impact more than 50,000 Indigenous children.\n\nThe tribunal decision has sharply divided candidates vying for a chance to lead the country on 21 October.\n\nBoth Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic party, and the Green party\u2019s Elizabeth May pledged to honour the ruling \u2013 and compensation \u2013 if elected. But the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer, tied with Trudeau in recent polling, told reporters he would appeal the tribunal\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cThis is a far-reaching decision that has major impacts on multiple levels of government,\u201d said. \u201dIt would be appropriate to have a judicial review.\u201d\n\nTrudeau\u2019s move, which comes only days before the deadline to file an appeal, was met with sharp criticism from child welfare advocates.\n\nCanada has spent $110,000 to avoid paying $6,000 for indigenous teen's orthodontics Read more\n\n\u201cIt is the federal government\u2019s discriminatory conduct that needs review and reform \u2013 not the legal decision that flagged the problem and ordered the discrimination to stop,\u201d Cindy Blackstock, executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society, told the CBC. For years, Blackstock has been fiercely critical of the government\u2019s previous refusals to implement decisions from the tribunal.\n\n\u201cEvery party leader must commit to honouring this ruling made by Canada\u2019s own Human Rights Tribunal,\u201d tweeted Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations. \u201cThis is about supporting First Nations children and families, and respecting human rights. It is unconscionable that anyone would oppose this.\u201d\n\nThe outgoing parliamentarian Romeo Saganash, who previously said that Trudeau \u201cdoesn\u2019t give a fuck\u201d about Indigenous rights in the House of Commons, tweeted his frustration.\n\n\u201cI never want to hear one single Liberal pronounce the word Reconciliation, ever again!\u201d", "description": "Government to appeal ruling that found youth were \u2018wilfully and recklessly harmed\u2019 under welfare system", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf1631962c8fded0f58ef0af96dbee918dc4b821/0_0_3200_1921/master/3200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=48cc648c108dec79c7488d74df8f9010", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
