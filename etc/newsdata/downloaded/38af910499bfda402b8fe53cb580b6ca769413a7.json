The outcome will decide the fate of Brexit and potentially his own future.\n\nUnlike his predecessor, Theresa May, the prime minister wants Britain to have far looser ties with the European Union after leaving, which means withdrawing in full from the bloc\u2019s customs union. That decision may have helped him to pacify the Tory right, which torpedoed May\u2019s proposals three times, but it leaves him facing opposition on multiple fronts. The opposition Labour party, for starters, wants to remain in the EU customs union.\n\nWith the voting in Parliament on whether to back his deal too close to call, here are some of the key issues that Johnson has to navigate.\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party has refused to back his deal because it would see Northern Ireland being treated differently for customs purposes to the rest of the U.K. The grouping is also unhappy that it won\u2019t be able to exercise a veto on the arrangements, after Johnson diluted it in an effort to secure the EU\u2019s backing for his plans.\n\nThe DUP\u2019s view matters because the opposition of the party\u2019s 10 MPs contributed to Johnson losing a key Brexit vote on Saturday. Can he win them over? Unlikely, as my colleague Dara Doyle has explained here.\n\nJohnson Has a Big Brexit Problem: His Northern Irish Friends\n\nScotland\n\nIf they can have it, why can\u2019t we? Voters in Scotland, who overwhelming wanted to remain in the EU, are unlikely to relish the idea that Johnson\u2019s deal will give Northern Ireland special treatment. The province will be closely aligned with the EU\u2019s customs rules, potentially giving companies in the region an advantage over their Scottish peers.\n\nThe Scottish National Party will almost certainly ramp up pressure for a second independence referendum after Brexit. Will Johnson be able to avoid the breakup of the U.K.?\n\n2020 Cliff Edge\n\nAs the U.K. has frittered away a year of its two-year transition period already, the Withdrawal Agreement Bill creates a new cliff edge: If a free trade agreement hasn\u2019t been reached with the EU by the end of 2020, then we are back to leaving without a deal. When Conservative MP John Baron pointed this out in a BBC interview, waverers took it to mean that Johnson isn\u2019t serious about leaving with a divorce agreement.\n\nThe Not-So-Level Playing Field\n\nThe prime minister moved the U.K.\u2019s commitments to abide by EU standards on tax, labor protections and environmental standards from the Withdrawal Agreement into the Political Declaration -- which, crucially, isn\u2019t legally binding.\n\nJohnson has pledged to protect labor rights, but opposition Labour politicians are deeply skeptical he really means it. He will need to convince at least a few to believe him if he is to get his deal through Parliament.\n\nSecond Referendum?\n\nLabour is backing an amendment to put Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal to hold another referendum -- something the government has so far resisted.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Edward Evans in London at eevans3@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, Stuart Biggs\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Boris Johnson is giving members of Parliament only a few days to debate the most important change to Britain\u2019s constitution in almost 50 years.
