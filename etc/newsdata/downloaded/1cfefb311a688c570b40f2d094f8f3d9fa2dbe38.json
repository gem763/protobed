However, the decision did also provide some degree of latitude, arguing that there are cases where some restrictions may be warranted and permissible.\n\nSince that time, though, we\u2019ve been in a non-stop battle to determine just what those limits can and should be. Both sides have their own opinions on the matter and the debates can be somewhat brutal.\n\nHowever, a city in California is proposing a couple of measures that would essentially ban guns within the community.\n\nA near outright gun ban is what Mayor Albert Robles wants for the City of Carson. On Tuesday, he\u2019s presenting a resolution for a radical plan to limit gun sales and gun possession. \u201cTechnically, legally, (you) can\u2019t ban gun dealers in the city, but we can regulate where they cannot be and we\u2019re saying, we don\u2019t want them in Carson,\u201d Robles said. Robles\u2019 plan involves the city\u2019s land use powers. Gun sales and gun possession would not be allowed within a one-mile radius of a school, park, church, or day care, making it impossible for anyone to be in the city limits with a gun. The only exception is having a gun inside your home. \u201cIf the true purpose of owning your gun is to protect your home and your family, then that is where your gun belongs, is in your home,\u201d Robles said. Even with that exception, Loyola Law Professor Jessica Levinson says it\u2019s not likely to hold up in court. \u201cThis strikes me as a resolution that is just too broad,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if you want to use land use, you still have to contend with the fact that the Second Amendment is an individual right. The right to bear arms is something that the Supreme Court has said every individual has.\u201d\n\nPrecisely the problem.\n\nI took a quick look on Google Maps. Carson, California isn\u2019t particularly large. You\u2019re looking at a total of seven miles across from the most distant points I could find. If you create a one-mile radius from every school, park, church or day care, then there\u2019s nowhere to go with your gun. The problem is, the right to keep and bear arms is the right to keep and bear arms.\n\nRobles is trying to make it so that you\u2019re pretty much relegated to keeping a gun in your home and never taking it out of there.\n\nEver.\n\nHe claims that if you want to protect your home and family, your gun needs to be in your home, but plenty of bad things happen outside of the home. If someone has a carry permit, why shouldn\u2019t they be permitted to carry a firearm to protect their family outside of that home? If Gilroy and Thousand Oaks didn\u2019t perfectly illustrate that danger isn\u2019t confined to the home, I don\u2019t know what will.\n\nThen again, Robles doesn\u2019t care about that. He\u2019s guzzled so much anti-gun Kool-Aid that he thinks something like this is a good idea. It\u2019s not, and if Carson continues this nonsense, they\u2019re going to find themselves in the middle of a court case that even the Ninth Circus isn\u2019t going to let them slide out of.", "description": "The measure would make it illegal to have a gun anywhere except inside your home.
