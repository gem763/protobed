It also marked Moscow's deepening influence in the region two weeks after the United States started to pull out forces from Syria.\n\nThe balance of power in Syria's years-long civil war has shifted significantly since Trump announced the withdrawal of US troops on October 6, allowing Turkish-backed forces to sweep in to attack Washington's former Kurdish-led allies, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).\n\nTurkey paused its offensive last week under a US-brokered deal that called for the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), which form the backbone of the SDF, to withdraw. Ankara then secured Russian support this week for a wider deal requiring the YPG's removal from the whole northeast border.\n\nAnkara considers the YPG a \"terrorist\" group linked to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a Kurdish separatist group inside Turkey. The PKK is designated as a \"terrorist group\" by the United States and the European Union.\n\nRussia and the Kurds\n\nA complete pullout of the YPG would mark a victory for Erdogan who has said he is seeking to create a \"safe zone\" for the return of millions of Syrian refugees.\n\nNext Tuesday, Russian and Turkish forces will jointly start to patrol a 10km (6 mile) strip of land in northeast Syria where US troops had long been deployed along with their former Kurdish allies.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the SDF withdrawal could be enforced.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned Kurdish forces if they did not retreat, Syrian border guards and Russian military police would have to fall back.\n\n\"And remaining Kurdish formations would then fall under the weight of the Turkish army,\" he said.\n\nThe Kurdish-led SDF was Washington's main allies in the fight to dismantle ISIL's self-declared \"caliphate\" in Syria.\n\n'Thank you'\n\nSDF commander Mazloum Abdi held a phone call with Russia's Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu, Interfax news agency reported, and said he backed the actions of Russian military police and Syrian military.\n\n\"Currently, units of the Russian military police and regular Syrian troops are being deployed into many locations. We are providing them with all kind of help and assistance,\" Russian news network RT quoted Abdi as saying.\n\nAbdi thanked Russia \"for ensuring safety of the Kurdish people\" while discussing with Shoigu thei mplementation of the deal.\n\nFollowing Turkey's announcement that its offensive against the Kurdish forces was over, US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday the ceasefire it brokered last week was now permanent and he was lifting all sanctions imposed on Ankara.\n\nTurkey's military operation was widely condemned by its NATO and European Union allies, who said it was causing a new humanitarian crisis in Syria's eight-year conflict and could allow ISIL prisoners being held by the YPG to escape and regroup.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Russian, Syrian security forces aim to push Kurdish fighters back from the border as part of deal reached with Turkey.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/24/7bcd2c55aba44fdfaf4e1186ef66afe8_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
