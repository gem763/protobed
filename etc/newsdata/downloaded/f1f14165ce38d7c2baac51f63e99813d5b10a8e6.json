And all the other media houses there said: 'Oh my God, this guy is really naive, he is telling us everything'.\"\n\nSurve said there was no use in having secrets.\n\n\"If you believe that the future of our country and business is in working together with small business, big business, medium business, government and the private sector, and you genuinely believe that, you must be transparent and walk the talk,\" he said.\n\n\"As South Africans we like to complain, we like to gossip and like to do all these things because they keep us busy at the braai. But at the end of the day we must be very careful we don't throw the baby out with the bath water.\"\n\n\n\n", "description": "Sekunjalo Group chairperson Iqbal Surve has urged business competitors, including those in the media to work together instead of destroying each other.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2900/7bf6aa0d03364a46bfe8cdb3754d8c01.jpg", "published_at": "2014-10-23"}
