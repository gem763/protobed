Or something like that. He was a novelty, the next iteration of Herman Cain, an entertaining sideshow in an otherwise solemn field of Democratic contenders.\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nToday, it\u2019s no longer possible to dismiss Yang so easily. In the six months since Marchand came onboard, Yang has outpolled senators and House members in the race, raised substantial funds, and cultivated a fanatical online following that calls itself the Yang Gang. Nowadays, Marchand says, his biggest headache in running Yang\u2019s New Hampshire operation is finding enough qualified people fast enough to build an operation that can compete with Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. When he and I spoke last month, Marchand told me his team numbered in the single digits. It had doubled by the following week. He now tells Rolling Stone that the campaign is expecting to surpass 75 full-time staff in New Hampshire by the end of the month.\n\nOn Wednesday, his campaign announced it had raised $10 million in the previous three months. For perspective, Yang\u2019s third-quarter haul is $4 million more than Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), $8 million more than Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), and only $1.6 million shy of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.). Still, Yang is polling well behind Warren, Sanders, and Joe Biden. If not a miracle, he needs a dramatic realignment inside the Democratic Party to win the nomination.\n\nIn order to do so, Yang and his team must translate his viral support into a real campaign \u2014 without losing what makes Yang Yang. That means on-the-ground organizing in early primary and caucus states, a strategy for the crucial but unglamorous work of winning delegates in as many states as possible, and a plan for turning Yang into a household name. All while preserving the candidate\u2019s unscripted and refreshingly unpolitical style.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he\u2019s so different resonates,\u201d says Rebecca Katz, a progressive political consultant who worked for Sen. Harry Reid and advised Bill de Blasio\u2019s 2013 New York mayoral run. \u201cThe candidates doing the best are the ones who are authentic. There is a case to be made that Andrew Yang could be one of the last people standing out of a field of 25 candidates.\u201d\n\nOver the past month, half a dozen of Yang\u2019s senior staffers told Rolling Stone about their plan to build what is essentially Yang 2.0 and not wind up as the next Ron Paul or Dennis Kucinich: fringe candidates with small but loyal followings who could never break into the mainstream. \u201cIn my office, there\u2019s one poster on the wall: It\u2019s the primary and caucus calendar, and then all the way into November of 2020,\u201d says Nick Ryan, Yang\u2019s campaign chief. \u201cThis is a candidate and campaign that are built to last.\u201d\n\nFor much of its brief existence, Yang 2020 has been an online phenomenon. As Yang told Rolling Stone earlier this year, \u201cI came from the internet.\u201d When I interviewed him back in June, his entire campaign had just over 30 full-time staffers. (For context, Sanders, at the time, had more staff than that just in New Hampshire.) Yang\u2019s top aides were political newcomers: Ryan, the campaign chief, was a former Army platoon leader who joined the campaign after going to business school at NYU, and Zach Graumann, Yang\u2019s campaign manager and unflappable sidekick, had worked on Wall Street and run a small nonprofit. Employees filled multiple roles, and the whole thing had a make-it-up-as-you-go vibe. \u201cThe vaguer the title, the more accurate it is,\u201d Carly Reilly, Yang\u2019s deputy chief of staff, told me back then.\n\nYang\u2019s first inflection point was his appearance on Joe Rogan\u2019s wildly popular podcast in February. The next inflection point was the second Democratic debate, in July. After a dismal showing at the first debate, Yang gave a strong (and unorthodox) performance in Detroit. Afterward, there was a boost in interest in Yang and his universal basic income proposal \u2014 a surge that has never receded. \u201cThat was really the moment,\u201d Marchand says.", "description": "The dark-horse Democrat just raised $10 million.
