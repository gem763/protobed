I was scared every day and I just \u2014\u201d the woman said before bursting into tears.\n\n\u201cSo here\u2019s the thing,\u201d Ms. Harris responded. \u201cYou\u2019re right to feel that way but you also have to remember that we\u2019re all in this together, OK? You always have to know that you\u2019re not alone, do you hear me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t want to die,\u201d the woman replied.\n\n\u201cNo, baby, you\u2019re not going to die,\u201d Ms. Harris said. \u201cYou\u2019re not and we\u2019re going to be smart and we are going to win.
