Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed Senate Bill 27 into law in July.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Morrison England Jr. seemed consistently skeptical of California\u2019s arguments in favor of the law. He acknowledged the ruling will almost certainly be appealed.\n\nEngland was appointed to the court in 2002 by President George W. Bush.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged that the federal court tentatively concluded that a preliminary injunction should be granted,\" said Jay Sekulow, counsel to Trump. \"We look forward to the court\u2019s written order.\u201d\n\n\"It remains our position that the law is unconstitutional because states are not permitted to add additional requirements for candidates for president, and that the law violates the Constitution,\" he added.\n\nAttorneys for California acknowledged that the law\u2019s impetus was Trump\u2019s refusal to release tax records that could illuminate the workings of his business empire.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has started a new custom among presidential candidates, and that\u2019s what the Legislature wanted to avoid,\u201d said attorney Peter Chang. But he maintained that, while the motive may have had partisan roots, the civic justification applies evenly.\n\n\u201cIndividuals don\u2019t have the right to run for office. When they choose to run for office, they insert themselves into the public discourse,\u201d Chang argued, and the burden of releasing returns is \u201coutweighed by the state\u2019s compelling interest in informing voters.\u201d\n\nBut attorneys seeking to block the law argued otherwise, saying candidates have a right to certain measures of confidentiality.\n\n\u201cThere is a preference among conservative voters for that viewpoint of keeping your tax returns private,\u201d said Harmeet Dhillon, who is representing the California Republican Party, calling it \u201can electoral value to retain their privacy\u201d for many Republicans.\n\nDhillon raised additional concerns, speaking to reporters outside the courtroom. She said losing Trump from the primary would be a \"huge burden\" for California Republicans and that eliminating \"the most popular Republican in the country from the ballot is going to have a huge downballot effect.\u201d\n\nMuch of the courtroom debate turned on the balance between states\u2019 autonomy and the federal government\u2019s supremacy in determining who is eligible for the ballot, with lawyers for the plaintiffs saying federal law is intended to prohibit a state-by-state patchwork.\n\nBeyond that technical argument, opponents warned that the law could disenfranchise millions of voters and, more insidiously, encourage other states to enact additional ballot hurdles \u2014 a point Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown made in vetoing a similar bill in 2017. Attorneys mused about states requiring health records, genetic test results and school transcripts.\n\nIf Republican-led states had demanded Barack Obama\u2019s transcripts when the fringe birther movement was ascendant, \u201cthat would have been met with an uproar, and rightfully so,\u201d said Paul Rossi, an attorney for perennial California candidate Roque de La Fuente.\n\nThe California law would send the country down a \u201cdark path,\u201d Rossi warned, that would \u201cfundamentally change the nature of elections in this country.\u201d\n\nDarren Samuelsohn contributed to this report.", "description": "Gov.
