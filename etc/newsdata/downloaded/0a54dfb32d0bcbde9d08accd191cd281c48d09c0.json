Only in IRELAND \u2618\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f.'\n\nLinda has been keeping a relatively low profile of late and was last pictured attending an event with her granddaughter back in May.\n\nThat was the first time she had been seen since police were reportedly 'called to her home twice in two weeks over her erratic behaviour' back in January.\n\nScreening: Linda Robson was last pictured out with her granddaughter in May at a Paw Patrol event - it was the first public event since police were reportedly 'called to her home twice in two weeks over her erratic behaviour' in January\n\nAccording to reports, the Loose Women star had not been sleeping well over the festive period and it 'all got a bit too much'.\n\nLinda, who has recently lost more than two and a half stone in weight after ditching alcohol and sugar, is reportedly now on the road to recovery.\n\nLinda is reportedly now on the road to recovery but a source previously told The Sun: 'It all got a bit too much for Linda and the family, and that\u2019s why they called in police and experts.\n\n'The family reached breaking point as Linda\u2019s behaviour was becoming a bit erratic. They were worried she might hurt herself.'\n\nAt the time, MailOnline has contacted the Metropolitan Police and Linda's representative for comment.\n\nLinda has lost more than two and a half stone in weight after ditching alcohol and sugar, after admitting to drinking a bottle of wine a night.\n\nDuring a candid Loose Women discussion, the actress claimed she didn't have a problem with alcohol, but feared her nightly tipple could have led to a serious health issue.\n\nShe said: 'I used to drink a bottle of wine a night. I didn\u2019t have a problem but now I think about it, it could have easily turned into one.\n\n'That is a lot to be drinking. I didn\u2019t think it was an issue as I didn\u2019t need it when I woke up.'\n\nIt wasn't until Linda entered the Australian outback in 2012 for I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here that she was forced to give up alcohol for a time, and it subsequently led to the start of her weight loss.", "description": "Linda Robson took to Instagram on Monday to share a picture of herself becoming godmother to two children she had never met before.", "authors": ["Rebecca Davison For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/09/19434100-0-image-a-73_1570525175430.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
