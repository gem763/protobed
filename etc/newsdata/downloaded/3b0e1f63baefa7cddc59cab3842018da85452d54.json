Bernie Sanders, one of the leading 2020 candidates, has been off the trail for a week since he suffered a heart attack on Oct. 1. In his absence, his campaign has been on autopilot.\n\nThey\u2019ve dispatched surrogates to early states on his behalf. They\u2019ve rescheduled an ad buy in Iowa that was postponed in the wake of the medical emergency. They\u2019ve announced a new policy plan to get money out of politics. They\u2019ve sent supporters to a climate strike with Greta Thunberg. They pushed out the news that Sanders plans to participate in the upcoming Democratic primary debate was out.\n\n\u201c[The strategy] is to show that this campaign continues to have momentum and energy and enthusiasm,\u201d says Rep. Ro Khanna, a national co-chair to the Sanders campaign. Sen. Sanders built the campaign, Khanna says, \u201cExplicitly on a premise that this is not about him, that it\u2019s about all of us.\u201d The plan now is for him to rest while the \u201cmovement\u201d carries it forward.\n\nBut that plan is also a test. Sanders\u2019 aides are declining to say when he will be back on the trail full time, and with his return date uncertain, and his poll numbers sagging, a question hangs over the campaign: how long can the 78-year-old\u2019s movement maintain momentum without him.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nSanders told reporters Tuesday outside his home in Burlington that whenever he does return, he will have to change the \u201cnature\u201d of his campaign. \u201cProbably not doing four rallies a day,\u201d Sanders answered when a reporter asked him what he meant.\n\nHis allies are trying to put the best face on the situation. Khanna, who was a surrogate for Sanders in Iowa over the weekend, says that the events he attended there had high turnout. \u201cPartly I think people were coming out to show their support in light of what happened with Sen. Sanders.\u201d\n\nPolitical watchers are turning their attention to next week\u2019s primary debate, where the expectations for Sanders are high.\n\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t show up at the debate next week and perform very well, there\u2019s going to be a rising crescendo of people telling him to step down if only for health reasons,\u201d said a longtime Democratic strategist. \u201cThis is going to be nagging him.\u201d\n\nSanders, who is resting at home in Burlington, VT, on Tuesday morning told reporters outside of his home that in the past couple of months, he\u2019d started feeling fatigued more than usual.\n\n\u201cI must confess that I was dumb,\u201d Sanders said in a video by CNN. \u201cI should have listened to those symptoms. I should have listened to those symptoms. So if there\u2019s any message that I hope we can get out there, it\u2019s that I want people to pay attention to their symptoms.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear when Sanders will return to the trail outside of the campaign\u2019s commitment that he\u2019ll participate in the Oct. 15 debate. Asked if any decisions had been made on timing of his return or what other events Sanders would participate in, a campaign aide did not answer the question.\n\nBut Sanders has some leeway. By all measures, he has established himself as a top-tier candidate who is in the race for the long haul. Not only was he himself campaigning at a relentless pace prior to the heart attack, but he consistently comes in the top three in polls, raised the most money in the third fundraising quarter, and has qualified for both the October and November primary debates.\n\nDespite being the oldest Democratic candidate running, Sanders is often spotted playing sports while out on the trail, or walking briskly around Capitol Hill. People close to him have noted his personality does not mesh well with being sidelined.\n\n\u201cThis is everything he hates all at the same time,\u201d a former aide to Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign said, noting that Sanders\u2019 personality likely has him wishing more attention would be paid to the policy rollout his campaign made Monday morning rather than to his health and age.\n\nOf how this will affect voters\u2019 perceptions of Sanders, the former aide, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, said, \u201cMy sense is most people don\u2019t really care, because even if you\u2019re drawn to Bernie, you\u2019re not drawn to him because he gets on a skateboard. \u2026 My sense is it won\u2019t really bother his supporters.\u201d\n\nThe initial instinct in the campaign was to relay little information after they announced Sanders had experienced chest discomfort and needed two stents inserted to address a blocked artery. The campaign would not confirm details about the Senator\u2019s well being while he was still in the hospital, and did not say whether he\u2019d had a heart attack until after he\u2019d been dispatched days later.\n\nBut since his release, Sanders has been spotted multiple times out in public. Sanders tweeted a video of himself standing alongside his wife and close adviser, Jane Sanders, in Las Vegas after he\u2019d been released from the hospital on Friday, thanking well wishers. Reporters saw the couple taking a walk around their Burlington neighborhood on Monday. In a video by CNN of the exchange he had with reporters, Sanders said he\u2019d be back on the trail \u201csoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think over the next week or two, people are going to be a little skittish about his health,\u201d says Patrick Bourgeacq Pinz\u00f3n, a staff member at Drake University who endorsed Sanders in August. \u201cBut as soon as they realize that he\u2019s just as or more energetic than he was before, I\u2019m sure people will realize that this was nothing.\u201d\n\nWrite to Lissandra Villa at lissandra.villa@time.com.", "description": "Sanders has been off the trail for a week since he suffered a heart attack in las Vegas.
