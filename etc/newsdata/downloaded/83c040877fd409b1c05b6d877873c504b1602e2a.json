Several men and women perched on the hood of a Holden Kingswood show the fashion of the 90s presented a more comfortable feel compared to current styles but an item such as An Adidas tracksuit would not be out of place in the party scenes of today\n\nTeens dance an spot their way across the gratified cooktop benches of the former meat works with bum-bags and denim on denim proudly on display\n\nA snapshot into the life of budding photographer Simon Burstall as the then 17-year-old become immersed into the cult like rave culture of the time. He tells of parties stretching out from 10pm into the morning as the delirious teens finally surrendered to the sunlight and headed home\n\nThe unruly industrial space was loved by teens and those in their early 20's who used the space as a make-shift community centre for indigenous and non-indigenous groups alike\n\nNovelty rings and striped tops were well on display as the rebellious attitude was given a space to let out before people headed back into their everyday lives\n\nNoise complaints were a regular occurrence with community front runner Tony Spanos clashing with police who would argue that youth needed a place to vent their frustrations and a place to feel a sense of community\n\nThe space offered an explosion of creativity for bands, graffiti artists to be given a place to practice their art without restriction or, in the case of the former, trouble with the law\n\nPhotographer Simon Burstall told of raves being advertised through flyers that would usually attach a number for party goers to ring up and receive secret clues to the location\n\nMates would pile into whatever car they had at their disposal and head to parties after footy training or perhaps just to smell a bit better for the ladies they hoped to impress", "description": "Historic photos of a once thriving Sydney night life show the stark contrast to today's scene hindered by the 2014 lock out laws.
