And one thing is clear: while those sitting in jail for weed may be black, when cannabis legalisation eventually hits our shores, it will be dominated by white men in suits.\n\nIt is not surprising that big money follows marijuana. Even with cannabis stocks currently taking a pummeling in the financial markets, estimates suggest the global legal industry will grow to $66.3bn by 2023.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Our choice will absolutely make an impact seven generations into the future, and further,\u201d she explained.\n\nAs Canadian further education roll out courses on the cannabis economy, from production to applied science, and US universities allow students to enroll in classes from marijuana law and policy to journalism, the industry represents a ripe opportunity for our youth.\n\nBut for people of colour, in the UK and beyond, the potential impact extends beyond money. It\u2019s a chance to shape the future industry in a way that repairs the disproportionate harm that the war on drugs has caused to our communities.\n\nA 2019 report by Vienna-based think tank has even gone so far as to explore the extent to which the industry could be structured to meet the aims of the sustainable development goals of the United Nations.\n\nThe report authors found that the potential of cannabis, in appropriately regulated settings, is transformative for our societies, \u201cso long as ethical practices and sustainable approaches are kept central\u201d.\n\nThe reality is that, at present, big money is shaping the debate on the future of cannabis in the UK. Black folk\u2019s hesitancy to enter the space surrounding what is still a controlled substance is not surprising given the decades of racist propaganda churned out as part of the war on drugs.\n\nYet if we want proper answers to tough questions such as the potential correlation between psychosis and cannabis use, or how to successfully move people from the illicit to the regulated side of the trade, it will be down to us and the generations that follow to ensure that Bame youths are not just on the agenda but a core part of future policy and practice.\n\nIt is about time we, as a community, reconceptualise the way we think about this plant. Because as cannabis becomes commoditised, the price of the crop will inevitably fall.\n\nWe need to stop thinking of our youth as slinging bags of weed on street corners. Forward-thinking countries, particularly in the Caribbean, are creating industries that add value to this plant through ancillary industries including intellectual property, real estate, technology and tourism.\n\nAs Martin Drewry, CEO of Health Poverty Action, said in an interview earlier this year: \u201cThere's an opportunity here \u2013 we have the chance to create an entirely new legitimate sector from the ground up.\u201d\n\nThe decision is ours as to whether this opportunity is one we seize or squander.\n\nZoe Smith is a fellow of the School for Social Entrepreneurs and the founder of Caribis, a platform concerned with the Caribbean\u2019s legal cannabis sector", "description": "Just why is Sir Simon Woolley, founder of Operation Black Vote, calling for people of colour to get involved in the UK\u2019s burgeoning medical cannabis space?
