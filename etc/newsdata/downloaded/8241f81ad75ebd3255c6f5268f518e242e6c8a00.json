That\u2019s why creating and funding Education Savings Accounts for military families is a critical step in supporting our fighting forces\u2014and it\u2019s the right thing to do for those who are already sacrificing so much for the rest of us.\n\n\u201cHow children are educated is probably one of the most important decisions that parents can make. Providing an opportunity for school choice is especially important for military families. Troops have refused promotions or considered leaving the military because of dissatisfaction with the education their children are receiving. In the past several years, we\u2019ve seen the Air Force experience pilot shortages and the Army miss its recruitment goals. How can we expect military moms and dads to fight for their country when they\u2019re worried about fighting for their own children\u2019s education?\n\n\u201cThe security of every American depends on the ability of our armed forces to meet their recruitment numbers and retain the troops they have, and that depends on us doing our part to support their families while they\u2019re fighting for ours. The Education Savings Accounts for Military Families Act does this by providing parents with educational options for their children.\n\n\u201cI want to thank Rep. Jim Banks and Senators Ben Sasse, Tim Scott, and Tom Cotton for introducing this bill that not only supports our military families but enhances military readiness by providing an attractive resource to both recruit and retain service members.\u201d", "description": "WASHINGTON\u2014Heritage Foundation President Kay Coles James released the following statement about expanding Education Savings Accounts for military families.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png"}
