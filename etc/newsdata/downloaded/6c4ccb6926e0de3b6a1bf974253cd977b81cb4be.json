This hiring criteria would favor white men from privileged backgrounds and wouldn't necessarily pick the best-performing candidate, David Wilcox, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute, told The New York Times.\n\nSo the Fed made a change: it began prioritizing soft skills like collaboration and teamwork; it considered work experience and extracurricular activities; and it standardized interview questions for each applicant.\n\nRead more: A Twitter cofounder says a more diverse team would have addressed abuse earlier. Science says he's probably right.\n\nThe aim was to consider a more diverse range of applicants, without explicitly selecting based on race or gender.\n\nThe new hiring process resulted in 5% more women and 6% more men in research assistant positions between 2014 and 2017, according to Brookings.\n\nWhat other companies can learn from the Fed\n\nMany hiring experts have adopted similar strategies as the Fed to increase their diversity numbers.\n\nJoanna Coles, chief content officer of Hearst Magazines, broadened her applicant pool by tapping into new, diverse professional networks. Google encourages the use of standardized, quantitative measurements to hire candidates, rather than it just \"feeling right.\"\n\nPatty McCord of Netflix said her best hires had been people that gave awful interviews but had great technical understanding, or had a creative interest that demonstrates they could \"toggle between their left and right brains.\"\n\n\"Making great hires is about recognizing great matches\u2014and often they're not what you'd expect,\" McCord wrote in the Harvard Business Review.\n\nIn the long run, having a diverse team only helps an organization: research suggests diverse teams come up with more ideas, and make fewer errors.\n\n\"Beyond fairness, the lack of diversity harms the field because it wastes talent,\" former Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen said at a recent Brookings Institution, according to The New York Times. \"It also skews the field's viewpoint and diminishes its breadth.\"", "description": "Instead of prioritizing resumes from Ivy League grads, recruiters began taking work experience and soft skills into greater consideration.", "authors": ["Allana Akhtar"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d950bec62f8d812961a9d5c?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
