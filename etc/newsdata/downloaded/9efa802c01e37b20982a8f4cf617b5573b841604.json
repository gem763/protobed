But already, anguished American military and national security officials are sounding alarms that clearing the way for Turkey to bomb the Kurds could have long-term repercussions, just as the desertion of allies did then.\n\n\u201cIn the course of American history, when we have stuck with our allies in troubling circumstances, from the U.K. and Australia under attack in WWII to South Korea in the Korean War, things tend to work out to our benefit,\u201d said James G. Stavridis, a retired admiral and former supreme allied commander for Europe. \u201cWhen we walk away from loyal allies, as we did in Vietnam and are now threatening to do in Afghanistan and Syria, the wheels come off.\u201d", "description": "Officials are sounding alarms that clearing the way for Turkey to bomb the Kurds could have long-term repercussions, just as the desertion of allies did three decades ago.", "authors": ["Helene Cooper"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/10/us/politics/10dc-military-1/10dc-military-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
