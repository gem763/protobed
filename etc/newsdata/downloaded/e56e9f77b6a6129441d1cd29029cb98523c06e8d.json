But they have voted for an amendment that effectively now forces him to seek a delay to Brexit until 31 January.\n\nThe prime minister has said he will not \"negotiate\" a delay with the EU but it is unclear what will happen next.\n\nA law passed in September - the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act 2019, also known as the Benn Act - compels Mr Johnson to write a letter asking for an extension if a deal has not been agreed in the House of Commons by the end of 19 October.\n\nDelaying the UK's exit date requires an extension to Article 50, the part of the Lisbon Treaty which sets out what happens when a country decides that it wants to leave the EU.\n\nIt allows an initial two-year period for negotiations on a divorce - finalising a withdrawal agreement and drawing up the broad outlines of a future relationship.\n\nArticle 50 was triggered by then Prime Minister Theresa May on 29 March 2017, giving an exit date of 29 March 2019.\n\nThis date was extended twice, first to 12 April and then until 31 October, after Mrs May's deal was rejected in successive votes in the House of Commons.\n\nSo how does the extension process work?\n\nThe UK makes a request\n\nThe UK cannot make a decision about extending Article 50 on its own - it needs the agreement of all 27 other EU countries (EU27).\n\nThat's what happened when the original 29 March deadline was extended.\n\nOn that occasion, the request was made in a letter from Theresa May to the European Council, on 20 March.\n\nThe EU's decision\n\nAssuming that the prime minister does at least send a letter asking for an extension, the EU is not obliged to say yes to the UK - although it has repeatedly stressed its desire to avoid a no-deal Brexit.\n\nIf the EU were to reject the extension request, that would give MPs a stark choice between Mr Johnson's deal and no deal.\n\nRevoking Article 50\n\nIt's worth pointing out that Article 50 can also be withdrawn or revoked.\n\nThe UK can in theory do that without consulting anyone else. That would mean that Brexit would not happen and the UK would remain in the EU on the same terms it has now.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats are the only party to say that would they would revoke Article 50 without a referendum if they won a majority in a general election.\n\nThe European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled that a revocation should be \"unequivocal and unconditional\", suggesting that the ECJ would take a dim view of any attempt to withdraw an Article 50 notification and then resubmit it again a short time later.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "description": "The law states if no deal has been agreed by 19 October, Boris Johnson must ask for an extension from the EU.", "authors": ["Rachel Schraer", "Bbc Reality Check"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7F92/production/_109285623_gettyimages-1176491869.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
