However, in a interview with ITV to coincide with the network\u2019s new documentary, Harry & Meghan: An African Journey, our duchess was asked about her physical and mental health with her transition into the royal family, and, in a rare moment of candor, admitted she wasn\u2019t doing so well at times. \u201cAny woman, especially when they\u2019re pregnant, you\u2019re really vulnerable, and so that was made really challenging,\u201d Markle explained, holding back tears. \u201cAnd then when you have a newborn, you know. And especially as a woman, it\u2019s a lot. So, you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or trying to be a newlywed.\u201d\n\n\"Not many people have asked if I\u2019m ok ... it\u2019s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.\"\n\n\n\nMeghan reveals to ITV's @tombradby the intense media spotlight has left her struggling to cope while becoming a mum #HarryAndMeghan https://t.co/Uy21iE6ozJ pic.twitter.com/kZqhZV66OL \u2014 ITV News (@itvnews) October 18, 2019\n\n\u201cThank you for asking,\u201d she also told the reporter. \u201cNot many people have asked if I\u2019m okay, but it\u2019s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.\u201d Markle\u2019s candid interview comes shortly after she and her husband, Prince Harry, confirmed via an open letter that they\u2019ll be suing The Daily Mail for \u201cthe misuse of private information\u201d and \u201cinfringement of copyright.\u201d The British tabloid previously published a private and emotionally charged letter written by Markle to her estranged father, Thomas, which was penned after he missed the couple\u2019s wedding back in 2018.
