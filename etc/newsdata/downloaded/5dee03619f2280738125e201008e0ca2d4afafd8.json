And one industry expert believes that taxes and a still thriving black market for marijuana, are partly to blame.\n\n\u201cThe legal market is struggling with the set of regulatory rules and tax rates that are pretty onerous and make it fairly uncompetitive versus a thriving black market that\u2019s had the whole industry for 60 years now,\u201d Tom Adams, BDS Analytics managing director, told Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi PM in an interview this week.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s marijuana excise tax produced $74.2 million in revenue for the second quarter of this year, according to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s marijuana excise tax produced $74.2M in revenue for Q2 2019. More\n\nYet back in January, Governor Gavin Newsom's proposed budget predicted the state would generate $355 million in excise tax revenues for the fiscal year. That projection was later revised down again to $288 million back in May.\n\nThe shortfall is reminiscent of Michigan, where a nascent medical marijuana market has resulted in lower than expected revenue.\n\nAdams contended the legal market faces additional expenses like the cost of testing, that the illegal market does not.\n\n\u201cI think the one thing that could be done about it easily would be for local regulators who really hold the keys to allowing stores to open, is to get over the idea that they\u2019re preventing cannabis consumption by not allowing legal cannabis consumption,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not of course -- there\u2019s been illicit cannabis consumption all over California for decades,\u201d he added.\n\nYahoo Finance's All Markets Summit, Oct. 10 More\n\n-\n\nMcKenzie Stratigopoulos is a producer at Yahoo Finance.
