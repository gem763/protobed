Analysts have questioned\n\nEuropean competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager launched a preliminary look at Amazon's practice of using its data to build its private-label business last year, although a spokesperson said in an email that the EU has not yet begun a formal probe.\n\nGermany's antitrust regulator is probing how Amazon treats third-party merchants who use its marketplace. It says its investigation differs from the EU inquiry, but that the two \"proceedings supplement one another.\"\n\nIn Washington, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 who's running for the White House \u2014 has expressed concerns about Amazon\u2019s growing role as a seller on its own platform.\n\n\u201cYou got to pick one business or the other, baby,\u201d Warren said in September. \u201cYou want to be a competitor, be a competitor, that\u2019s great. You want to be the platform provider, that is a different function.\u201d\n\nYes, but: It could be hard for regulators to crack down on Amazon\u2019s in-house product efforts in the United States, where most anticompetitive practices are ruled illegal only when consumers are hurt \u2014 often by a price increase.\n\nProgressive lawmakers could use legislation to make antitrust law more applicable to major tech platforms, including Amazon.\n\n\"Would you speak to how the commission determines whether conduct has anti-competitive effects in non-price competition and how you make those determinations?\" Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), the new chair of the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, asked Federal Trade Commission chairman Joe Simons at a recent hearing.\n\nThe other side: Amazon told Axios that selling private-label products is a standard practice in retail that broadens selection for customers. It said third-party sellers continue to do well on its platform.\n\n\"Retail is fiercely competitive and it\u2019s common for companies to offer customers private label products \u2014 consumers see it every day when they walk into a store,\" said an Amazon spokesperson in a statement, which noted the company represented only a small percentage of global retail, although its share of online retail is large.\n\n\u201cAmazon\u2019s private label products are less than 1% of our total sales. This is far less than other retailers, many of whom have private label products that represent 25% or more of their sales,\" the spokesperson said in an additional statement after this story was published. The company added that private-label products accounted for a greater percentage of sales at retailers like Costco, Walmart and Kroger, as well as major European brands, than they do at Amazon. (The \"less than 1%\" figure does not include sales at the Amazon-owned Whole Foods grocery chain.)\n\nWhat\u2019s next? Amazon watchers say the company has accelerated its efforts to sell its own products or products it markets exclusively.\n\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey analysts Youssef Squali and Naved Khan estimated in June that private-label product sales would generate $7.5 billion for Amazon in 2018, a significant increase from their estimate for 2017.\n\n\u201cThe company remains very early in building a sizable private-label business, and as such, we expect growth in this segment to continue to outstrip overall e-commerce\u2019s growth at Amazon,\u201d they said.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated with additional comment from Amazon.", "description": "Generic products have existed for years, but critics say Amazon has an unfair advantage.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/DOPQbCQLry4YmOmx3Dp6Wwko_hk=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/01/06/1546803876592.png", "published_at": "2019-01-10"}
