By pulling troops out unilaterally, they argue, Mr. Trump has emboldened America\u2019s enemies and distressed its allies. Friends like Israel, they note, worry about American staying power. Foes like North Korea and the Taliban learn that they can achieve their goals without having to pay a price.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to divine any real strategic logic to the president\u2019s moves,\u201d said John P. Hannah, a senior counselor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a former national security adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney. \u201cThe only real connective tissue I see is the almost preternatural isolationist impulse that he invariably seems to revert to when left to his own devices internationally \u2014 even to the point that it overrides his supposed deal making instincts.\u201d\u2026\n\n\u201cWhen he canceled the South Korea military exercises, the only person he consulted was Kim Jong-un,\u201d Mr. Brigety said. \u201cThe decision to abandon the Kurds came after a brief phone call with Erdogan.

They were taken after he took the counsel of strongmen over that of his own advisers.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Trump-Troop-Withdrawal.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
