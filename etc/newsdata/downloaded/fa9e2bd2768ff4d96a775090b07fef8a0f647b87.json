Here, the age-old prank seems terrifying and completely reckless.\n\nFor the past week, a mysterious group of people dressed in ninja outfits have been ringing residents\u2019 doorbells around the town. At first, residents thought it was a simple prank, until it was observed that the perpetrators were wearing ninja costumes\u2014and were adults. These factors reminded everyone of a horrific case of mass hysteria in which residents believed ninja sorcerers were targeting members of Nahdlatul Ulama, a traditionalist Sunni Muslim movement between February and August of 1998. The ensuing witch hunt cost the lives of between 115 and 150 people.\n\nMany theories surrounded the door-knockers. Some believed the whole thing was a politically-motivated clandestine military operation meant to destabilise Nahdlatul Ulama leading to the regime\u2019s fall. Indeed, a rumor arose claiming the ninjas were highly-trained military personal, with witnesses claiming they saw people in ninja costume using walkie-talkies.\n\nMore than 20 years later, the case remains unsolved and utterly bizarre. But the lynchings are still fresh in locals\u2019 minds.\n\n\u201cMy nephew saw four of these men come up to his door,\u201d claimed one resident named Nehrawi, who like many Indonesians goes by a single name. The mysterious figures knocked on Nehrawi\u2019s door last Wednesday. The next evening, his they visited his nephew\u2019s home, who saw them scurrying away into the night.\n\nAmidst these latest door-knockings comes a fresh wave of paranoia. Many residents have been arming themselves with homemade weapons fashioned from sticks, hoes, and stingray tails. Others have also been consulting witch doctors and fortune tellers, which is considered a normal course of action in hyper-superstitious Banyuwangi society.\n\nOne such resident met with a mystic who claimed that the masked perpetrators were on a quest to achieve the power of invisibility. Apparently they have 40 days to complete a number of tasks, one of which apparently requires knocking on strangers\u2019 doors and scaring them senseless.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that even though this theory may sound implausible to the average VICE reader, it\u2019s wouldn't be considered unreasonable in Banyuwangi, which remains deeply superstitious.\n\nIn his book The Banyuwangi Witch Doctor Killings: A Study of Collective Violence from a Constructivist Perspective, sociologist Hasan Ali wrote, \u201cRegarding all important things related to daily life, most Using people (Banyuwangi natives) will consult a paranormal.\u201d\n\nSutrisno, another local, is positive that the recent spate of ding-dong ditchings have nothing to do with those in 1998, but remains wary. \u201cNo one\u2019s been killed, but the whole situation is making us all worry,\u201d he told local media.\n\nIndonesian site Detik News has detailed some of the ways in which people are venting their fears. A local named Busairi has even taken to the streets with a loudspeaker demanding the perpetrators \u201cstop disturbing us.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the perpetrators, please don't bother us anymore. The poor people don't know anything,\u201d Busairi has been preaching. Then, more alarmingly, he\u2019s been counseling residents to \u201cbreak the legs and break the hands\u201d of anyone found ringing doorbells. \u201cThis is an order,\u201d he adds.\n\nThis article originally appeared on VICE ID.", "description": "People in Banyuwangi have reported seeing people dressed in ninja costume, prompting fears of a repeat mass panic.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d3e939724bfa200093a9c16/lede/1564473151459-2001-03-15T120000Z_399383764_RP2DRIIFFRAA_RTRMADP_3_INDONESIA-WAHID.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.7429xh;0xw,0.1014xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-07-30"}
