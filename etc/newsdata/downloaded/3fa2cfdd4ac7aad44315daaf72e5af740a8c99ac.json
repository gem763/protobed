(Bill Kostroun/AP)\n\nEli Manning\u2019s run as the starting quarterback for the New York Giants came to an end this week after almost 15 years when Coach Pat Shurmur announced that rookie Daniel Jones was taking over under center beginning Sunday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nOn the surface, Manning did everything a team could ask of its franchise quarterback. He made a franchise record 232 starts since he replaced Kurt Warner in late 2004, including 210 in a row, still the second-longest streak for an NFL quarterback. He twice defeated the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl, ending New England\u2019s bid for an undefeated season after the 2007 season. Manning ranks sixth in completions (4,860), seventh in passing yards (56,537) and eighth in passing touchdowns (362) in league history. Then there are his four Pro Bowl bids and two Super Bowl MVP awards.\n\nIt\u2019s a solid r\u00e9sum\u00e9, with that last item nearly guaranteeing that Manning will be enshrined in Canton once he is eligible. But make no mistake: His induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame will lower the bar for every quarterback who comes after him.\n\nJust look at the numbers. Manning\u2019s career completion rate (60.3 percent) is below the league average (63 percent) over the course of his career, ranking 46th among 73 passers with at least 1,000 attempts since 2004. His average yards per pass (7.0) are also below average, ranking 39th in that span. Same for his touchdown-to-interception ratio (1.5, 37th).\n\nThose are also key ingredients in a player\u2019s passer rating. And Manning\u2019s 84.1 rating is below the league average of 89.2 during his career; he ranks 42nd among passers with at least 1,000 attempts, behind quarterbacks such as Jay Cutler, Sam Bradford and Trent Green. Even Manning\u2019s regular season won-loss record, a team stat that is an admittedly terrible barometer of individual performance, is a decidedly average 116-116. In fact, the only stats in which Manning ranks in the upper half of the league are the raw counting stats such as passing yards and touchdowns, byproducts of a virtually uninterrupted 15-year career.\n\n[Eli Manning being benched for Daniel Jones was inevitable. The only surprise is the timing.]\n\nTo put this mediocrity in context, there are only two Hall of Fame quarterbacks who finished their careers with a below-average passer rating after adjusting for the era in which they played: Charley Trippi and Jim Finks.\n\nTrippi, who played from 1947 to 1955, was a quintuple threat, finishing his career with 3,506 rushing yards, 2,547 passing yards, 1,321 receiving yards and 7,907 punting yards, plus four interceptions and 13 fumble recoveries as a defensive back. Finks spent time at quarterback and defensive back from 1949 to 1955 and was the architect of the \u201cPurple People Eaters,\u201d the dynamic defensive line of the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nThe Hall of Fame quarterbacks who played after the NFL-AFL merger in 1970 all have been above average in passer rating. That includes those with and without Super Bowl rings. Enshrining Manning would thus be unprecedented.\n\nUnder Pro-Football-Reference\u2019s era-adjusted passer rating, 100 is considered the league average, with higher numbers indicating better performances.\n\nWarren Moon has the lowest era-adjusted passer rating index among modern Hall of Fame quarterbacks without a Super Bowl win. His 80.9 career rating, produced from 1984 to 2000, earned an era-adjusted passer rating index of 106. Jim Kelly, also a non-Super Bowl winner despite four straight championship appearances from the 1990 to 1993 seasons, was the next lowest in this group at 111.\n\nThere are seven quarterbacks in the Hall of Fame who played all or part of their careers after 1970 and won one Super Bowl: Joe Namath, Ken Stabler, Brett Favre, Johnny Unitas, Kurt Warner, Len Dawson and Steve Young. All have an above-average passer rating after taking into account the era in which they played. The worst of the group is Namath, whose 65.5 career passer rating produced an era-adjusted passer rating index of 102 during his 13-year career (1965 to 1977).\n\nAmong the seven modern Hall of Fame quarterbacks with two Super Bowl wins or more \u2014 a group that includes John Elway, Bob Griese, Bart Starr, Roger Staubach, Troy Aikman, Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana \u2014 the era-adjusted passer rating indexes range from 105 (Elway and Bradshaw) to 123 (Montana).\n\nManning could finish his career with an era-adjusted passer rating index of 98, which is below average for his era.\n\n[Terry Bradshaw would \u2018pack my bags\u2019 and \u2018go home\u2019 if he were Eli Manning]\n\nManning isn\u2019t even the best quarterback from his draft class. Ben Roethlisberger and Philip Rivers have accumulated more Approximate Value (Doug Drinen\u2019s method of putting a single numerical value on any player\u2019s season, at any position, from any year) than Manning. If all quarterbacking production is included since 2004, Manning\u2019s rookie year, he falls to No. 8, behind two other passers, Aaron Rodgers and Matt Ryan, who were drafted after him. (Three players who preceded Manning \u2014 Drew Brees, Tom Brady and Peyton Manning \u2014 also rank ahead of him in Approximate Value since 2004.)\n\nPerhaps Manning is a true outlier, the unique quarterback whose postseason exploits outweigh his regular season performance to Hall of Fame voters. For some, the two Super Bowl victories at the expense of Brady and Bill Belichick, two titans who will define Manning\u2019s era, were r\u00e9sum\u00e9 enough. But at some point, it must be considered that those were team victories. And when the focus is solely on Manning\u2019s individual performance, his enshrinement could end up diminishing the Hall of Fame\u2019s standards.\n\nRead more:\n\nBest bets for NFL Week 3: Bears, 49ers and Chiefs roll on\n\nFantasy football cheat sheet: Week 3 sleepers and injury updates\n\nHow to replace Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger in your fantasy football lineups\n\nThe NFL\u2019s great quarterback transition is happening, and the most flexible teams will thrive\n\nDrew Brees is out, but Sean Payton isn\u2019t saying who will replace him as Saints\u2019 starter\n\nNo matter what the NFL does, its officiating headaches just won\u2019t go away\n\nBen Roethlisberger out for the season, will have elbow surgery\n\nLamar Jackson will let you choose how he beats you\n\nThe Cowboys look like legitimate Super Bowl contenders\n\nSaints fans cry foul after yet another bad call: \u2018We just want answers\u2019", "description": "Manning fares well on counting stats like touchdowns and passing yards, but his overall performance was below average for his era.", "authors": ["Neil Greenberg", "Reporter Analyzing Advanced Sports Statistics For The Washington Post", "September At Am", "Neil Greenberg Is A Staff Writer With The Washington Post Whose Beat Is Sports Analytics.
