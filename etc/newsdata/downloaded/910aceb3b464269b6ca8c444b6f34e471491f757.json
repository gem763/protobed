(Clayton County Police Department /AP)\n\nKenneth Bowen III aspired to be a police officer. The 24-year-old joined the Clayton County Police Academy in Georgia in June 2018 and spent three months with the department before he was ousted, officials say.\n\nNow, nearly one year later, police say Bowen\u2019s unceremonious stint as a recruit helped investigators identify him as the prime suspect in a string of rapes that have tormented the northern Georgia community since 2015.\n\n\u201cHad he not attempted to join the ranks of the Clayton County Police Department, it\u2019s questionable as to when we would have apprehended him,\u201d Kevin Roberts, the department\u2019s chief, said at an Aug. 28 news conference.\n\nBowen was arrested Aug. 27 on seven counts of rape and one count of sexual battery, according to jail records. Police obtained a search warrant when Bowen\u2019s DNA was found to be a forensic match in all eight cases, many of which took place within a two-mile radius of his home. Police had worked for more than three years to identify a suspect and finally made headway when investigators reviewed 911 calls related to suspicious people near the areas where the assaults occurred.\n\n[Officer who punched teen in face said he was resisting. But video \u2018raises concerns,\u2019 chief says.]\n\nA call from 2016 revealed Bowen\u2019s name and birthday, and investigators observed similarities between photos of him and a police sketch made from victims\u2019 descriptions. Lt. Thomas Reimers, a criminal investigator in Clayton County, told reporters that further digging led to more clues, including witness accounts, that all traced back to Bowen.\n\nHis social media profiles revealed a relative who once worked with Clayton County police, Reimers said. Investigators soon realized that Bowen had his own ties to the department.\n\nRoberts emphasized that Bowen never became a certified police officer. He was removed from the academy last year \u2014 a few months after joining \u2014 after he showed up hours late to training one morning in September. When confronted, Bowen reportedly gave conflicting, mendacious statements that Roberts determined were \u201creason to remove him from my academy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring an internal investigation, he was untruthful, which caused me to separate him from this agency, and we\u2019re better for it in this agency and better for it in this county,\u201d the chief added.\n\nNone of the assaults Bowen is charged with took place during his stint with the academy, Roberts said. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that five of the rapes took place between July 2015 and May 2017, and the most recent assault linked to Bowen took place in March of this year.\n\nPolice previously said the man targeted black women between the ages of 19 and 39, the newspaper reported. Officials said last week that the arrest would not have been possible without the aid of the victims, who bravely came forward and provided details that helped form the composite sketch.\n\n[Officers who led a black suspect through the streets won\u2019t be criminally investigated, state says]\n\nReimers said Bowen\u2019s alleged victims were \u201cecstatic\u201d upon learning of his arrest last Tuesday at the hands of U.S. marshals. Speaking to the Clayton News-Daily, one of the women said what she found \u201cmost disturbing\u201d was that Bowen \u201clived in walking distance to some victims.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust think if he stayed with the police department,\u201d the unnamed woman told the outlet. \u201cHe could\u2019ve had more access to victims and more power to hurt or even kill someone.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post does not generally name victims of sexual assault.\n\nIt was not clear whether Bowen had retained an attorney, and police say he declined to speak with investigators. He remained in custody at the Clayton County Jail on Tuesday and will return to court Sept. 24, according to the News-Daily.\n\nOpening last week\u2019s news conference, Roberts likened the spate of sexual assaults in the community to a dark cloud that had enveloped Clayton County.\n\n\u201cToday, it\u2019s my pleasure to remove that cloud,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nTeen goes \u2018blind\u2019 from 7-year diet of french fries, white bread and ham slices, doctors say\n\nA 14-year-old confessed to fatally shooting five of his family members, authorities say\n\nA man pulled a gun to demand Popeyes chicken sandwiches after they sold out", "description": "Kenneth Bowen III was ousted after three months with the Clayton County Police Academy last year for lying to officials, police say.
