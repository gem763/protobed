I haven't spoken to Rudy,\u201d Trump said, when asked about it.\n\nPresident Trump was asked if Rudy Giuliani was still his lawyer after two Giuliani associates were indicted in federal court on alleged campaign finance violations\n\n'I spoke to him yesterday briefly. He's a very good attorney, and he has been my attorney\u2014yeah, sure,' Trump responded.\n\nOn Thursday, it was revealed that Trump's team is bringing on former GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy as part of his impeachment defense, but Trump said Gowdy would not be able to start immediately due to revolving door rules.\n\nGiuliani promoted Ukrainian investigations of the Bidens that President Trump brought up with the president of Ukraine\n\nLev Parnas and Igor Fruman were arrested and charged with campaign finance crimes in an indictment unsealed Thursday. Both are Giuliani associates\n\nLev Parnas pictured with Rudy Giuliani\n\nFILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has coffee with Ukrainian-American businessman Lev Parnas at the Trump International Hotel in Washington\n\nGiuliani told New York magazine he has 'no reason to believe' he's not Trump's attorney. 'I am still his lawyer until he tells me I'm not,' he said.\n\nThe legal drama comes on a day when the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine whom Giuliani disparaged, Marie Yovanovitch, testified before the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nThe matter is part of what has become a House impeachment investigation. Giuliani has also spent months probing Hunter Biden's board position on a Ukrainian gas company. Trump in his infamous call with the Ukrainian president asked for a 'favor' and brought up an investigation of former Vice President Biden and his son.\n\nIn one astonishing development, Giuliani was revealed to have dined with the two indicted men, Viktor Parnas and Igor Fruman, hours before they were arrested at Dulles airport with one-way tickets to Europe.\n\nA series of explosive revelations have followed since then, leading Giuliani to go out in repeated cable TV appearances to defend his president and tie his opponents to overseas intrigue.", "description": "President Donald Trump said 'I don't know' Friday when asked if he was still being represented by Rudy Giuliani a day after to associates of the former New York mayor were indicted.", "authors": ["Geoff Earle", "Deputy U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/00/19611274-0-image-a-29_1570835399968.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
