That sort of performance, to Guardiola's mind, puts undue pressure on the back four and is one that would make them vulnerable in Europe.\n\n'Little margins are the difference in the Champions League,' he said. 'I really believe these situations is about the mentality. We are working on it.\n\n'When we talk about boxes it's always (focused on) the defence but it is in front too. That is where we have to improve. It was always like this. We've got to think, to know when things are dangerous.\n\n'Teams don't give you 20 chances in Europe. The players know this. We've spoken many times about it. After creating chances you have to be solid, you cannot give away the goals we've given this season. We've made a number of mistakes that we shouldn't make at this level.\n\n'If you're two on one, or around the six-yard box, you have to score a goal. If not it becomes more difficult in this competition against these top teams.'\n\nRegardless, a victory over Atalanta on Tuesday night would put them within a win of qualifying from Group C. While eyes are not yet on the knockout stages after New Year, Guardiola is aware his team need to take the initiative in big matches.\n\nThe Catalan, who did not watch Liverpool's draw at Manchester United on Sunday, also insisted they do not need to alter their style against the best \u2013 as long as his squad follow the basics.\n\nIt was a galling exit last season for City after they saw a late goal disallowed by VAR\n\nGuardiola leads wild celebrations on the touchline before Raheem Sterling's goal was ruled out\n\nMan City fixtures Premier League unless stated Tuesday Atalanta (H) Champions League group stage October 26 Aston Villa (H) October 29 Southampton (H) EFL Cup fourth round November 2 Southampton (H) November 6 Atalanta (A) Champions League group stage November 10 Liverpool (A)\n\n'I don't like to change something for one specific game,' he added. 'But sometimes you have injuries or problems, you have a smell from the team and you have to do it.\n\n'It's to do with the fact that two times in the Champions League we went out on goal difference and in both games we conceded a lot of goals.\n\n'When we conceded three goals against Tottenham, it was with Vincent (Kompany) and Aymeric (Laporte), who were incredible last season.\n\n'It's not about specific players. It's about making a fluid game in the build-up. We concede fewer goals then.'\n\nIntriguingly, Guardiola blamed himself for the shock defeat by Wolves before the international break and used that display as a case study for how not to play.\n\n'We were nervous, our build-up was not in our mind. We didn't do it in training, it was my mistake, we didn't prepare well on how you make a build-up against a different set-up.\n\n'When that happens we concede a lot. It's all related. In this competition, you play against incredible players and if you give them one moment, a metre, they will score. We have to know that.'", "description": "Pep Guardiola believes mentality is the main barrier to Manchester City securing Champions League glory.
