She did not remember being shot.\n\nWhat she did remember, Gordon told Atlanta Police Department investigators, was an argument with her ex-boyfriend, Jerrontae Cain, in May 2017, the same month her mysterious symptoms began.\n\nMurder with Impunity: How domestic violence leads to murder\n\nGordon told authorities at the hospital that she had been in her vehicle during their fight when the driver\u2019s side window broke and crashed on her face, knocking her unconscious.\n\nAD\n\nWhen she briefly awoke soon after, she said, she realized she was no longer in her vehicle but Cain\u2019s.\n\nAD\n\nCain took her to his mother\u2019s home, Gordon told police, where they treated her for the wound on her head that she believed came from broken glass. They did not take her to a hospital or seek professional medical care, authorities said.\n\nIt would take more than two years, an FBI search for Cain and a standoff between the man and police before a jury would hear investigators\u2019 theory about what really happened the night Cain and Gordon fought.\n\nIn January 2019, a year and a half after Gordon was taken to the hospital, authorities arrested Cain. Gordon had not been injured by glass, police said, but by a bullet from a gun that Cain fired.\n\nAD\n\nThis week, a jury in Fulton County Superior Court found Cain, now 39, guilty of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, aggravated battery, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony crime and possession of a firearm by a felon, according to a statement from the Fulton County District Attorney\u2019s Office. Cain had a lengthy criminal record and had been convicted of sexual battery in 2010.\n\nAD\n\nHe was sentenced to 25 years in prison on the assault charges, followed by five years of probation once he is released.\n\nAfter Gordon, now 42, was taken to the hospital in 2017, authorities questioned Cain about the alleged altercation, according to the district attorney\u2019s office. Cain told police he was with Gordon the night she was injured but said the head trauma was caused by a vehicle accident. Her car had crashed into a tree, Cain told authorities, which caused the driver\u2019s side window to shatter.\n\nAD\n\nBut when authorities investigated the alleged incident, which took place outside Gordon\u2019s home, their findings \u201cproved to be inconsistent with Cain\u2019s explanation,\u201d according to the district attorney\u2019s office. And Gordon\u2019s injuries, doctors determined, were \u201cconsistent with being shot in the head.\"\n\nAD\n\nA warrant was issued for Cain\u2019s arrest in 2017, but he fled.\n\nIn February 2018, the FBI\u2019s Atlanta field office requested the public\u2019s help in locating Cain. A tip to Crime Stoppers Atlanta was conveyed to authorities, according to Patch.com, and in January 2019 the FBI-led Atlanta Metro Major Offender (AMMO) task force found Cain at an address in the Atlanta suburb of College Park.\n\nAD\n\nCain hid in the attic of the house and engaged in a two-hour standoff with the FBI Atlanta SWAT team. He eventually surrendered, Patch reported, and was taken into custody.\n\nDuring his trial, Gordon\u2019s friends testified that Cain had a history of abusing her. On several occasions, they said, Gordon had bruises on her body and multiple black eyes.\n\nThe bullet remains in Gordon\u2019s head, officials said, because doctors determined that any attempt to surgically remove it could be deadly.\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAn airman was picking up an award for heroism.
