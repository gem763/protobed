And he previewed how he might go about doing that on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert Thursday night.\n\nAs Colbert laid it out during their interview, there is now a solid top tier of three\u2014Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders\u2014while Buttigieg, along with Kamala Harris, is on a second tier below them. \u201cSome are saying it\u2019s Tier 1B, just for the record,\u201d Buttigieg joked.\n\n\u201cHow do you cut into it?\u201d Colbert asked him. \u201cIn what ways do you think you can make an impression in a debate? What\u2019s your strategy?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that it\u2019s starting to winnow down, people are starting to look for the contrasts,\u201d Buttigieg replied. \u201cAnd it will be important for me to convey how I\u2019m different than the others. I like the others, I appreciate the others but I\u2019m not like the others.\u201d He said it\u2019s \u201cnot just a matter of style,\u201d but a \u201cmatter of approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s why I'm not making some of the promises that some of the candidates to my left are,\u201d the South Bend mayor said, pointedly. \u201cI share the goals and believe that we can do it in a way that will bring Americans together.\u201d\n\nAs an example, Buttigieg pointed to his \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It\u201d plan, which does not go as far as the plans that Warren and Sanders have put forward. \u201cI agree we should have universal health care and I agree that we should have a public alternative and that the public alternative will be better,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it's important to have Americans to choose that and vote with their feet instead of ordering a hundred million Americans to switch and hoping it works out.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo these are some of the contrasts that I think will be important to surface in the debate,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Fox & Friends\u2019 Worries Pete Buttigieg Might Be the Next Obama\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
