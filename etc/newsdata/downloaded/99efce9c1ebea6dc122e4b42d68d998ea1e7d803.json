Adam Schiff (D-Calif.),hold a press conference on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. (Sarah Silbiger/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe intelligence officer whose allegations of presidential wrongdoing have sparked a full-blown impeachment inquiry sought guidance from a Democratic-led congressional committee days before filing his complaint with an inspector general, according to panel aides.\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s interaction with an aide for Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, reflects the officer\u2019s sense of urgency in surfacing the allegations that President Trump had pressed the president of Ukraine to intervene in the 2020 election in a way that would harm a potential political rival. It is also fairly routine for the committee to receive an informal inquiry from a whistleblower before a formal complaint is made, according to current and former committee staffers.\n\n[Whistleblower claimed that Trump abused his office and that White House officials tried to cover it up]\n\nThe revelation, first reported Wednesday by the New York Times, prompted an immediate jab by the president, who suggested without evidence that Schiff may have helped compose the whistleblower complaint.\n\n\u201cHe knew long before, and he helped write it, too,\u201d Trump said at a news conference alongside Finnish President Sauli Niinisto. \u201cThe whole thing is a scam.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for the whistleblower, whose identity has not been made public, rebutted Trump\u2019s claim.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d attorney Mark Zaid said.\n\nAndrew Clark, a Trump reelection campaign spokesman, questioned whether the whistleblower\u2019s legal team coordinated with Schiff or his staff. Zaid said there was no contact between the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers and Congress until weeks after the complaint was filed with the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general.\n\nA spokesman for the House Intelligence Committee, Patrick Boland, said, \u201cLike other whistleblowers have done before and since under Republican- and Democratic-controlled committees, the whistleblower contacted the committee for guidance on how to report possible wrongdoing within the jurisdiction of the intelligence community.\u201d\n\nAt no point, Boland said, \u201cdid the committee review or receive the complaint in advance.\u201d\n\nThe committee staffer who interacted with the intelligence officer was given only \u201cthe very bare contours\u201d of the allegations, said a committee aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the aide was not authorized to speak for the record. As is common when such calls are received at the committee, the staffer advised the individual to seek legal counsel and file a complaint with the inspector general \u2014 either at the officer\u2019s home agency or with the intelligence community inspector general.\n\nThe officer \u2014 whose identity, aides said, is not known to Schiff \u2014 did just that, lodging a formal complaint with Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson on Aug. 12.\n\nWithin two weeks, Atkinson determined the complaint was credible and met the whistleblower law\u2019s definition of an \u201curgent concern,\u201d triggering a seven-day deadline by which the director of national intelligence was required by law to transmit the complaint to the House and Senate intelligence committees.\n\nHowever, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, after consulting the White House and the Justice Department, declined to promptly submit the complaint to Congress. Instead, acting director Joseph Maguire told lawmakers last week that the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) had concluded the complaint was not an \u201curgent concern,\u201d saying the OLC determined that the activities at issue did not constitute an \u201cintelligence activity within the responsibility and authority\u201d of the ODNI.\n\nThe complaint described a July 25 call in which Trump pressed Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the activities of former vice president Joe Biden and his son and subsequent efforts to restrict access to records of the call. It also alleged that Trump asked Zelensky to look into unproven allegations that Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election originated in Ukraine.\n\nBy consulting Congress before filing a formal complaint, a whistleblower could be considered in violation of the law and might expose himself or herself to reprisal by his or her home agency, experts said. But, whistleblower attorney Bradley Moss said, retaliation for a security infraction of this sort \u2014 seeking informal guidance from Congress \u2014 is unlikely.\n\n\u201cIt would look ridiculously petty,\u201d said Moss, who is a partner in Zaid\u2019s law firm, though he is not personally representing the whistleblower.\n\nThe intelligence committee aide said the panel receives two to three whistleblower inquiries a month, or 20 to 30 a year, but only a small fraction end up meeting the \u201curgent concern\u201d definition.\n\nThe complaint against the president is, however, unprecedented in potential impact. \u201cThere has never been anything close to this complaint when it comes to the political implications and constitutional implications that we have here,\u201d Moss said.\n\nMost whistleblower complaints are about budgetary concerns or intelligence-gathering issues involving mid-level management, he said. \u201cThis one strikes at the heart of concerns about presidential abuse of authority.\u201d\n\nFelicia Sonmez contributed to this report.", "description": "Contrary to President Trump\u2019s claim, the House Intelligence chair had no role in drafting the complaint, the whistleblower\u2019s attorney says.", "authors": ["Ellen Nakashima", "National Security Reporter", "October At Pm", "Ellen Nakashima Is A National Security Reporter For The Washington Post.
