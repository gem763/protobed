He initially turned his anger on Choudhury, but later raised a wider question about protection for technical players like Salah.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAnd he believes football\u2019s lawmakers must now act to outlaw challenges like the one which kicked his brilliant forward out of the game.\n\n\u201cThis kind of challenge to me - I don\u2019t want to speak anymore about the player - but this has to be a red card. It is just too dangerous,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere are more dangerous challenges, it is possible, but do you see more dangerous challenges than that? It is really rare.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cIt not that I want to see players sent off. The best players are quick technicians and it should not be possible if you take them down this way you get a second chance.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it. It is more a general thing than this. It looked to me in the moment completely on purpose - he is away, stop the situation.\u201d\n\nThe whole of Anfield offered a collective intake of breath when Salah went off, and afterwards, he suggested he has an ankle problem. When asked about it, he admitted he didn\u2019t yet know how serious it was.\n\nKlopp also said he \u201cwasn\u2019t sure\u201d about the injury, but that it was clearly serious enough to force him off. Medics though, checked the player out instantly, and even though he had swelling and pain, fears of a serious injury to keep him out for months were eased.\n\nInstead, club doctors are hopeful he will be treated during the international break, and should be able to return when the Premier League gets back underway in two weeks.", "description": "Klopp provided an injury update on the Egyptian after he was forced off during the win over Leicester", "authors": ["David Maddock", "Image", "Pa", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20525604.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-v-Leicester-City-Premier-League-Anfield.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
