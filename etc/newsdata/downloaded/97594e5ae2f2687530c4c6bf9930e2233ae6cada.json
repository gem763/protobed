UCLA (0-1) leads 21-0-1. Even more impressive, the Bruins have outscored the Aztecs a whopping 695-241.\n\nCoach Rocky Long downplays the lopsided series, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s history. I don\u2019t care about history.\u201d\n\nFair enough, since the last game between the schools was two seasons before Long took over at SDSU, with UCLA winning 33-14 at the Rose Bowl in 2009.\n\nBut don\u2019t tell that to Aztecs fans, who have enjoyed four victories against Pac-12 teams since 2016, including in consecutive seasons against Arizona State, and would love to be able to boast about a victory over UCLA.\n\nLong likes to schedule at least one Pac-12 team per season, and sometimes two.\n\nHe said beating UCLA would be \u201cNo bigger than beating Arizona State or Stanford.\u201d\n\nThe Aztecs did that on consecutive weekends in 2017, winning at ASU and then beating Stanford in San Diego. SDSU beat the Sun Devils again last season in San Diego, two weeks after losing the season opener at Stanford.\n\n\u201cI just want to play Pac-12 guys,\u201d said Long, who was UCLA\u2019s defensive coordinator in 1996-97 prior to becoming head coach at New Mexico in 1998. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who they are. I like to play against the Pac-12, since we\u2019re basically in the same recruiting region. I don\u2019t have a vendetta against the Pac-12. We recruit against the Pac-12 more than we do against any other Power 5 league. And if we can get home-and-home, we get good crowds at home.\u201d\n\nThe Bruins will visit San Diego next season and again in 2023, with the Aztecs playing them at the Rose Bowl in 2026.\n\nUCLA has seven players from San Diego-area high schools. Among them is left guard Michael Alves, who missed the season-opening 24-14 loss at Cincinnati with a back injury. Alves\u2019 younger brother, Andrew, is a redshirt freshman fullback for the Aztecs.\n\nThat\u2019s the main reason Long downplays the lopsided nature of the series.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s history. It has nothing to do with this game,\u201d he said.\n\nLong said he thinks UCLA outplayed Cincinnati, which benefited from four turnovers by Bruins sophomore quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson, who threw two touchdown passes.\n\n\u201cThey outplayed them on offense and defense, every way they could, except they turned the ball over four times, or they could have won the game,\u201d Long said. \u201cLosing a football game because of turnovers does mean that you did not play well. Obviously the turnovers are a huge deal because they prevented you from winning. But they moved the ball well on offense and they probably would have scored two more touchdowns if they don\u2019t turn it over. They outplayed Cincinnati and they lost because they turned the ball over.\u201d\n\nThe Bruins are looking for their first win in their second season under Chip Kelly. They were 3-9 last year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard things about people worried about them, too,\u201d Long said. \u201cUCLA is a very good football team.\u201d\n\nSDSU won its opener 6-0 against FCS Weber State, getting only two field goals from its new spread offense.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t play very well,\u201d Long said. \u201cI\u2019d like to score a touchdown. Or two or three or four.\u201d\n\nThe last close game in the SDSU-UCLA series was in 1989, when UCLA won 28-25 in San Diego. The tie was in 1924 in San Diego, 13-13.\n\n___\n\nFollow Bernie Wilson on Twitter at https://twitter.com/berniewilson\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "San Diego State is still looking for that elusive first victory against UCLA nearly a century after the Aztecs first played the Bruins.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bernie Wilson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/08/29/ucla_cincinnati_football_32081_c0-171-3499-2211_s1770x1032.jpg?4b6c04db542538a7f660be6d274912fed7225713"}
