It's also home to the largest jazz festival in the world, the Festival International de Jazz de Montr\u00e9al, which just celebrated its 40th anniversary.\n\nFor this episode of Jazz Night in America, we'll pay a visit to the festival with its co-founder and legendary artistic director, Andr\u00e9 M\u00e9nard. Since the beginning, M\u00e9nard wanted an international festival that presents jazz as a constantly evolving artform, with many branches and styles. A place where he could present not only the best of jazz but also, say, Argentinian tango master Astor Piazzolla, and American blues giants like Muddy Waters.\n\nJoin us as M\u00e9nard shares some of his favorite festival memories from the last four decades, including guitarist Pat Metheny's performance for an outdoor crowd of 100,000, Diana Krall's springboard to jazz-vocal stardom and unforgettable concerts by legends like Ella Fitzgerald, Dave Brubeck and Oscar Peterson.\n\nSet List\n\nElla Fitzgerald, \"They Can't Take That Away From Me\"\n\nOscar Peterson, \"Cakewalk\"\n\nOscar Peterson, \"Bach's Blues\"\n\nPat Metheny, \"Are You Going With Me\"\n\nDave Brubeck, \"Tritonis\"\n\nDee Dee Bridgewater, \"Lonely Woman\"\n\nDiana Krall, \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\"\n\nChristian McBride Quartet, \"McThing\"\n\nCredits\n\nProducer: Sarah Geledi; Senior Producer: Katie Simon; Executive Producers: Amy Niles, Gabrielle Armand, Anya Grundmann; Senior Director of NPR Music: Lauren Onkey; Production Assistant: Sarah Kerson; Project Manager: Suraya Mohamed.
