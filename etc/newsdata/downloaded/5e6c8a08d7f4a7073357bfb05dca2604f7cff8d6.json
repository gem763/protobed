And it said the delays are not down to the safety or efficacy of the sprays.\n\nDr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at PHE, said it was working with Astra Zeneca and the NHS to 'ensure all eligible children get their flu vaccine as soon as possible'.\n\nShe added: 'Children who have underlying medical conditions that make them more vulnerable to flu will be prioritised by GPs first.\n\n'Vaccinations for other toddlers can also start, but some children may need to wait until later in November. The vaccine is the best defence we have against an unpredictable virus.'\n\nIt is unclear if private supplies of the nasal spray at pharmacists have also been affected by the testing delay at Astra Zeneca.\n\nIn total more than 25million people - around half the population - will be offered the free vaccine this year\n\nFEARS FLU VACCINE MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE This year's flu vaccine may not be effective, a top expert at the University of British Columbia warned last week ahead of the winter outbreak. Dr Danuta Skowronski told Stat News that this year's jab for the Northern Hemisphere - including the US, UK and Canada - is likely to be a 'mismatch'. Flu shots have to be newly developed ahead of each season based on predictions of which strains will be most active in the coming months. World Health Organization (WHO) officials choose the strains in February, and chose those for the Southern Hemisphere last week. For the Southern Hemisphere, officials chose influenza A/H3N2 and B/Victoria - different ones from the strains picked for the North. Dr Skowronski said that it suggests that the prior prediction was wrong and the Northern shots may be ineffective.\n\nChildren with long-term conditions, such as diabetes and kidney or liver disease, are at higher risk from flu, the NHS warns.\n\nThe NHS says: 'They're more likely to get severely ill if they catch flu and it could make their existing condition worse.'\n\nPulse reports the Welsh government is aware of the 'possible disruption' and chiefs in Scotland are 'exploring how to best use the available stock'.\n\nSchool vaccination programmes in England, Wales and Scotland will continue as normal, it added.\n\nAstra Zeneca said it needs to repeat some routine tests before some of the nasal sprays can be released for use in the UK. It said Brexit was not to blame.\n\nIn total more than 25million people - around half the population - will be offered the free vaccine this year. This includes all over-65s, pregnant women and people who work in the NHS.\n\nHealth leaders have repeatedly raised fears that the NHS faces a difficult flu season due to an unprecedented outbreak that has rocked Australia.\n\nPublic Health England chiefs did not say the roll-out to children aged 10 and 11 was prompted over concerns of a similar situation in the UK this winter.\n\nInstead, it warned schoolchildren act as 'super spreaders' of flu and said uptake of the vaccine among youngsters is well below the target of 65 per cent.\n\nThe vaccination programme will be under way by October 31 \u2013 despite delays to the adult flu vaccination programme.\n\nAround a third of the UK supplies that are manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur will not make it to the country until November 18, it is feared.\n\nThe company is one of three suppliers of the stock used to vaccinate people under 65 who are in the at-risk categories.", "description": "Public Health England has told GPs to prioritise vulnerable youngsters with underlying conditions, ensuring they are the first to get the nasal spray, because of the delay.", "authors": ["Stephen Matthews Health Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/11/20127754-0-image-a-40_1571914672228.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
