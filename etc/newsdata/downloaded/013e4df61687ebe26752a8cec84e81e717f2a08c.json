That\u2019s why this issue wasn\u2019t called, say, \u201cspecial issue\u201d, but a \u201cproject\u201d. It\u2019s as much activism as journalism. And that\u2019s the reason I\u2019m dwelling on this a few weeks later. I\u2019m constantly told that critical race theory is secluded on college campuses, and has no impact outside of them \u2026 and yet the newspaper of record, in a dizzyingly short space of time, is now captive to it. Its magazine covers the legacy of slavery not with a variety of scholars, or a diversity of views, but with critical race theory, espoused almost exclusively by black writers, as its sole interpretative mechanism.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I think that view deserves to be heard. The idea that the core truth of human society is that it is composed of invisible systems of oppression based on race (sex, gender, etc.), and that liberal democracy is merely a mask to conceal this core truth, and that a liberal society must therefore be dismantled in order to secure racial/social justice is a legitimate worldview. (That view that \u201csystems\u201d determine human history and that the individual is a mere cog in those systems is what makes it neo-Marxist and anti-liberal.) But I sure don\u2019t think it deserves to be incarnated as the only way to understand our collective history, let alone be presented as the authoritative truth, in a newspaper people rely on for some gesture toward objectivity.\n\nThis is therefore, in its over-reach, ideology masquerading as neutral scholarship.", "description": "", "authors": ["Andrew Sullivan", "Nymag.Com Intelligencer Andrew-Sullivan-Ny-Times-Abandons-Liberalism-For-Activism.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
