Joe Cunningham\u2019s house should be pretty interesting tonight, thanks to his wife\u2019s candor:\n\nNew video: Dem congressman Joe Cunningham's wife is outraged her taxpayer-subsidized Obamacare plan doesn't pay for her therapy, their marriage counselinghttps://t.co/HQLyf1g4Iy pic.twitter.com/3NXD4qD98c \u2014 Brent Scher (@BrentScher) September 9, 2019\n\nOh man.\n\nMore from the Washington Free Beacon:\n\nDemocratic congressman Joe Cunningham\u2019s wife is furious that their taxpayer-subsidized healthcare plan declined to pay for therapy sessions, according to a rant on an insurance bill she posted on Instagram. The South Carolina Democrat is currently serving his first term in Congress, where members are given access to Obamacare \u201cgold\u201d plans from Blue Cross Blue Shield and are responsible for paying about a quarter of the premiums. The plan is apparently not good enough for his wife, Amanda Cunningham, who told her Instagram followers she would be urging her husband to do something about it. \u2026 Cunningham\u2019s office did not respond to an inquiry into whether he agrees with his wife\u2019s assessment of the plan, but he wouldn\u2019t be the first freshman member dissatisfied with the Obamacare plan they\u2019re given.\n\nWell, maybe he doesn\u2019t want to discuss that sort of thing in public, you know?\n\nSounds like the congressman needs to have a chat with his wife about privacy. And maybe some other stuff.\n\nLet's see, she is ranting about their marriage counseling cost in public and telling her husband to do something about it in public. No problems here. \u2014 MTB (@nsewanswers) September 9, 2019\n\nJoe: get the hell out of there. \u2014 BravoKilo (@BravoKiloActual) September 9, 2019\n\nNow i can see why they\u2019re in marriage counseling \u2014 Alex Mascitti (@alexmascitti) September 9, 2019\n\ngood luck with that marriage \u2014 Zman (@daytrader133) September 9, 2019\n\nOh and I predict their marriage is toast from her oversharing their personal business. \u2014 commonsense (@commonsense258) September 9, 2019\n\nI think this video should take care of any marital problems\u2026 \u2014 B.T.
