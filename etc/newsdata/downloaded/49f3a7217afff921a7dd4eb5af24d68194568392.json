He had been scheduled to retire on November 8.\n\nAlbayalde rose to power as Duterte\u2019s enforcer in the brutal war on drugs the Philippines\u2019 president has waged since he took office in 2016.\n\nBut in recent weeks, Senate hearings have revealed accusations of a \u201cgrand cover-up\u201d by Albayalde when he was Pampanga police chief in 2013.\n\nAlbayalde was accused by a former police chief of intervening to prevent the dismissal of officers under his command after they seized 200kg of methamphetamine from a drug suspect, who they then allowed to escape after receiving a $1 million bribe.\n\nThe officers were also accused of only declaring 38kg of the total haul of drugs and retaining the rest for use in other operations, or selling it on.\n\nREAD: Duterte promises cash prize for capturing felons. But he's also fine if you kill them.\n\nBenjamin Magalong, the retired head of the criminal investigation and detection group, made the allegation accidentally during a Senate hearing on a different topic. A second police general came forward to back up the allegation and said Albayalde told him he \u201cgot a little\u201d of the bribe.\n\nDespite the mounting evidence against Albayalde, Duterte has refused to fire him, saying no criminal charges have been laid against the police chief, and insisting he needed \u201cclear proof\u201d before firing him.\n\n\u201cI can only speculate that maybe [Albayalde] had enough of the \u2014 according to him \u2014 false, unfair accusations and innuendos, especially because his family is suffering. Maybe the guy gave in,\" Duterte\u2019s spokesman, Salvador Panelo, told reporters Monday.\n\nREAD: Duterte said \u201cyou must be stupid\u201d if you think he\u2019ll stand trial at the Hague for his drug war\n\nDuterte\u2019s brutal crackdown on drug users and dealers has resulted in thousands of deaths. While the Philippines\u2019 police put the figure at 6,600 in a June report, human rights groups claim over 25,000 people may have been killed.\n\nCover: In this Oct. 3, 2019, file photo, Philippine National Police chief Gen.
