However, regulators will have to keep a very close eye at the global level, and believe me, we will do it,\u201d Villeroy said.\n\nFacebook has said it will apply for a license as a payments services operator in Switzerland, but this may not be comprehensive enough to satisfy regulators.\n\n\u201cIf issuers of stable coins also want to offer banking services such as deposits, financial investments and loans, then they will have to obtain a banking license in all countries where they operate. Otherwise these activities would be illegal,\u201d Villeroy said.", "description": "European Central Bank board member Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on Tuesday that \"stablecoins\" like Facebook\u2019s Libra highlight gaps in rules and the media giant's project faced a tough regulatory approach.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430801781&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0Q6-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
