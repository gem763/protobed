bracing for an onslaught, after 2.1 million people said they would rush the base on foot at an event organised on Facebook called \u201cStorm Area 51, They Can\u2019t Stop All of Us.\u201d\n\nThe event creator later said the whole thing had been a joke, but online masses committed to launch anyway.\n\nResidents worried that even a tiny fraction of that many out-of-towners could lead to chaos, choking the two-lane roads, scarring the desert with trash and camper trailers, and even draining the water table.\n\n\u201cPeople in Rachel moved out here to be away from all the crap,\u201d Mr Day, 61, said Friday morning. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what to expect.\u201d\n\nBut by Saturday, it appeared the invaders had come in peace. Law enforcement officials said they had made just a handful of arrests, including one man charged with indecent exposure after relieving himself at Area 51\u2019s security gate.\n\nMost people were heeding warnings from county sheriffs, state police and the Air Force not to assault the gates of a heavily guarded military base.\n\nAt 3am Friday, about 150 people made the 9-mile drive up a dusty road and surged towards the back gate, but mostly just laughed and pantomimed an invasion.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Sort of. A few visitors in alien goggles said they accepted the reality that Area 51, part of the Nevada Test and Training Range, had been used to develop spy planes, not hide alien spacecraft.\n\nBut like the X Files poster said, they wanted to believe. \u201cWe just wanted to see people like us,\u201d said Mike Main, who drove with his mother from Tampa, Florida.\n\nWhile some local residents spent the weekend pounding No Trespassing signs into the ground and stringing plastic webbing around their trailer homes, Don Williams said he had been won over by the visitors, who had arrived from as far as Massachusetts and even Australia.\n\n\u201cI love it,\u201d Mr Williams, 54, said as he and his brothers built a green concession stand \u2014 Outpost 51, obviously \u2014 on their property.\n\nFor days, interlopers have been streaming into town in camper vans and RVs, motorcycles and in some cases cramped two-door sedans that barely made the drive from Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nSince there are nearly no hotels for 50 miles, they set up tents in the dirt, bargained with residents for a bedroom in a trailer and rented $80-a-night (\u00a364) camper spaces. Some just pulled onto a patch of empty land and slept under the stars.\n\nRetirees who roam the country said they had detoured to Rachel and the nearby Hiko, Nevada, home to the Alien Research Centre, where another weekend event featured music and speakers steeped in the search for intelligent life and the history and lore of the military base.\n\nSome organisers were discovering that online fandom didn\u2019t necessarily mean people would burn a weekend driving into the Nevada desert.\n\nThe music at the Hiko site was called off for Saturday after so few people showed up, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported, though organisers said in a Facebook message that there would still be food stalls and alien discussions.\n\nTwenty-somethings who had driven from Los Angeles said they were sick of hypercommercial concerts and festivals, and liked being able to pull into a dirt lot where music was blasting from stage and people were lining up for pancakes outside one of the few businesses in town, the Little Al\u2019E\u2019Inn.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a Woodstock,\u201d said Seth Carlson, 32. \u201cI can\u2019t tell my kids I didn\u2019t make it to Area 51. This is history.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "The alien invasion was underway, and David Day wanted no part of it.", "authors": ["Jack Healy"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/21/13/Storm-Area-51-23.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
