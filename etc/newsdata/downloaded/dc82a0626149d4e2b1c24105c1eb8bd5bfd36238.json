Nadler has said repeatedly that he\u2019s been in an impeachment probe, and the Judiciary Committee declared it was engaged in a formal \u201cimpeachment investigation\u201d in legal filings in its oversight battles with the Trump administration.\n\nSo what\u2019s actually different now?\n\nNothing and everything. The process of investigating Trump isn\u2019t changing, but it now has the immense power of the speaker behind it. Pelosi has long been an impeachment skeptic, fearful that it might undermine Democrats\u2019 chances in 2020. Now that she\u2019s firmly behind the inquiry, it is far more likely to advance.\n\nIs Trump going to be impeached?\n\nWe can\u2019t predict the future, but it sure seems likely. We now count more than 200 Democrats and one independent (Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan) in support of an impeachment inquiry, and those numbers are likely to grow. It\u2019s hard to imagine that those same lawmakers wouldn\u2019t also back articles of impeachment if they reach the floor. A majority of the House, or 218 votes, are required to impeach the president and the math shows where the momentum is.\n\nINTERACTIVE: See where House lawmakers stand on impeachment\n\nWill Trump be removed from office?\n\nIf the House does impeach Trump, a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate is required to convict and remove him. At the moment, it seems highly unlikely that roughly 20 Republicans would join all Democrats to do so. But there may be bipartisan concern with Trump\u2019s effort to pressure the Ukrainian president into investigating a potential 2020 rival. And we\u2019re loath to guess the future any more.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/28/4a/24902a4940cc9718133ba6d65d8f/190925-donald-trump-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
