It\u2019s not a question of whether students of different races can go to school with one another, but whether they ever will. \u201cWhat\u2019s stunning about today\u2019s methods of avoiding integration is that they are, by and large, legal, but they nevertheless leave black students stuck in schools that are separate and unequal,\u201d Semuels wrote. The students south of I-630 are still left with less.\n\nThen, in 2014, Little Rock elected a majority-black school board for the first time. It made sense; at the time, two out of every three students in the Little Rock School District were black, according to a University of Arkansas database. And the two newly elected school-board members had focused their campaigns on addressing the district\u2019s inequality. But before they had a chance to do so, the local board\u2019s power was taken away. A few months after the election, on January 28, 2015, the Arkansas State Board of Education voted to take control of the Little Rock School District.\n\n\u201cThey believed that the state could offer some more stability and bring some more healing to the Little Rock School District,\u201d Anika Whitfield, one of the co-chairs of the education advocacy organization Grassroots Arkansas, told me. With the takeover, the argument for local control of public schools had been turned on its head. Typically, conservatives argue that more local control is better\u2014but here, a conservative-led state board was advocating for top-down intervention.\n\nBut stability did not follow. \u201cWithin the first year of the takeover, we had four superintendents,\u201d Whitfield said. When the state took over the district, six schools were failing its assessment; the state\u2019s 2019 data show that eight now are. After nearly five years, the state had not accomplished the fundamental goals of the takeover. Some residents of Little Rock were frustrated, but there was little they could do. When a locally elected school board is failing, members of the community can vote them out, Ali Noland, a parent in the district, told me. But when the school board consists of state-appointed officials, the same oversight is not possible. The relative feeling of powerlessness unified the community, Noland and other parents, elected officials, and advocates I spoke with told me. Black, brown, and white parents\u2014wealthy and low-income families\u2014all coalesced around the idea that they should have local control of their public schools.\n\nThen at a special board meeting in September of this year, as the five-year deadline to relinquish control of the schools from the state\u2019s hands was approaching, the state board released its plan to return some control to the district. The plan created a tiered system. Schools that were rated as failing would operate under \u201cdifferent leadership\u201d from the rest of the schools in the district, though it was unclear what exactly that meant. Only the top-rated schools in the district would be led by an elected school board. Each of the \u2018F\u2019-rated schools, save for one, was south of I-630.", "description": "A battle over local control in a city that was the face of integration shows the extent of the new segregation problem in the U.S.", "authors": ["Adam Harris"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTX1AIVC/facebook.jpg?1571691432", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
