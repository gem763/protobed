SingPost was rated \"BBB+\" in July 2018.\n\nS&P gave SingPost a stable outlook, reflecting its expectation that SingPost would consolidate its operations in the logistics and express delivery markets in the Asia-Pacific in the next 12 months. It also foresees that the mail and logistics firm would manage its costs and logistics capacity to support earnings growth and control its profitability decline.\n\n\"We also expect SingPost to rein in large acquisitions, given the absence of meaningful rating headroom,\" it added.\n\nIf SingPost fails to keep its debt-to-Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) ratio below 2.5 times on a sustained basis, the rating could fall further.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nMeanwhile, an upgrade \"looks unlikely\" for SingPost over the next two years, given its exposure to declining mail volumes and strong competitive pressures in the logistics and express delivery business, S&P\u2019s report noted.\n\n\"We may raise the rating if the company establishes a record of consistent governance and successful strategy execution,\" the agency said.\n\nS&P downgraded its rating for SingPost in November 2016 to \"BBB+\" from \"A-\" previously due to the postal service provider\u2019s tolerance for a higher \u2013 albeit sustainable \u2013 leverage, with a stable outlook.\n\nThe stable outlook reflects S&P\u2019s expectation at the time that the firm\u2019s debt-to-Ebitda ratio would stabilise below 2.5 times by end March 2018.\n\nIn February 2016, S&P cut SingPost\u2019s long-term credit rating from \"A\" to \"A-\", with a stable outlook amid increased earnings volatility. It also trimmed its rating for the company on the long-term Asean regional scale, as well as its various outstanding debt.\n\nThe downgrade followed a Nov 6, 2015 S&P decision to place SingPost on credit watch with negative implications.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Companies & Markets - CREDIT ratings firm Standard and Poor's (S&P) has maintained its \"BBB+\" rating of\u00a0Singapore Post (SingPost), according to a Thursday announcement.\u00a0SingPost\u00a0was rated\u00a0\"BBB+\" in July 2018. .
