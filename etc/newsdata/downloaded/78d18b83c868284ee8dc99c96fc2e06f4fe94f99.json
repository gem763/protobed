Daytona Beach International Airport, which followed Orlando's lead and announced plans to close late Sunday, also now plans to remain open. Read the earlier story below.\n\nAs Hurricane Dorian approaches, Daytona Beach International Airport and Orlando International Airport have announced they will be shutting down in the early morning hours of Labor Day.\n\n. \"Daytona Beach International Airport\u2019s terminal will close after the last flight departs Sunday night,\" announced an airport press release on Friday. \"When weather conditions worsen, the airfield will be open only for emergencies. There will be no flights beginning Monday until further notice.\"\n\nNews of Daytona Beach International Airport's upcoming closure follows a similar announcement from its sister airport in Orlando.\n\nKeep up with Dorian this weekend: Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox\n\n\"Orlando International Airport plans to cease commercial flight operations on Monday, September 2, 2019 at 2 a.m.,\" the airport tweeted on Friday afternoon. \"The latest update will always be pinned to top of our page. Travelers: Check with their airline for flight updates.\"\n\nIn an additional statement posted along with the tweet, the airport wrote that it made the decision \"out of an abundance of caution\" following a meeting with the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority executive leadership and emergency management leaders, airline officials, the FAA, TSA Air Traffic Control Tower representatives and more.\n\nHurricane Dorian headed toward the United States and strengthened to a 115-mph, Category 3 \"major\" hurricane Friday ahead of its expected landfall Monday into Tuesday along Florida's east coast, forecasters say.\n\nThe storm was slowly turning west on Friday as it makes it way back toward land and is expected to strengthen in the coming days, the National Hurricane Center said. Dorian is then forecast to slam the southeastern United States as a possible Category 4 storm.\n\nForecasters say Dorian will likely slow down considerably as it approaches Florida, allowing for heavy rainfall, dangerous winds and life-threatening storm surge to linger.\n\nMajor airlines are capping prices on fares out of Florida and adding additional capacity to flight routes as Hurricane Dorian approaches the U.S. Several airlines, which had already waived change fees for Caribbean flights, have added multiple Florida airports to their Hurricane Dorian alerts.\n\nHurricane Dorian: What's the forecast for Florida vacation spots?\n\nHurricane Dorian travel guide: What to know if you're flying or cruising Labor Day weekend\n\nContributing: Ryan W.
