That question was answered with a resounding \u201cyes\u201d as the United States stood up against and defeated, first fascism, and then communism. But in the 21st century, we face an entirely different kind of challenge. The challenge we face is precisely what the Founding Fathers foresaw would be our supreme test as a free society. They never thought the main danger to the republic came from external foes. The central question was whether, over the long haul, we could handle freedom. The question was whether the citizens in such a free society could maintain the moral discipline and virtue necessary for the survival of free institutions.\n\nBarr explained \u201cthe classical Christian tradition\u201d served as the inspiration for the Founding generation. The Framers knew humankind was capable of both great good and great evil.\n\nHe said they also knew that, if they were to create a system of powerful and coercive central government, the result would be \u201ctyranny.\u201d In contrast, without any restraint, \u201cyou end up with something equally dangerous \u2013 licentiousness \u2013 the unbridled pursuit of personal appetites at the expense of the common good.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is just another form of tyranny \u2013 where the individual is enslaved by his appetites, and the possibility of any healthy community life crumbles,\u201d he said.\n\nBarr said the Founders essentially took \u201ca gamble\u201d:\n\nThey called it a great experiment. They would leave \u201cthe People\u201d broad liberty, limit the coercive power of the government, and place their trust in self-discipline and the virtue of the American people. In the words of Madison, \u201cWe have staked our future on the ability of each of us to govern ourselves\u2026\u201d This is really what was meant by \u201cself-government.\u201d It did not mean primarily the mechanics by which we select a representative legislative body. It referred to the capacity of each individual to restrain and govern themselves.\n\nBarr explained the source of the internal control in a free republic such as America must be within the people themselves, \u201cfreely obeying the dictates of inwardly-possessed and commonly-shared moral values.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd to control willful human beings, with and infinite capacity to rationalize, those moral values must rest on authority independent of men\u2019s will \u2013 they must flow from a transcendent Supreme Being,\u201d the attorney general said:\n\nIn short, in the Framers\u2019 view, free government was only suitable and sustainable for a religious people \u2013 a people who recognized that there was a transcendent moral order antecedent to both the state and man-made law and who had the discipline to control themselves according to those enduring principles. As John Adams put it, \u201cWe have no government armed with the power which is capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion. Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate for the government of any other.\u201d\n\nBarr said religion supports free government by providing a guidebook of rules to live by, \u201cGod\u2019s instruction manual for the best running of man and human society\u201d:\n\nThe Founding generation were Christians. They believed that the Judeo-Christian moral system corresponds to the true nature of man. Those moral precepts start with the two great commandments \u2013 to Love God with your whole heart, soul, and mind; and to Love Thy Neighbor as Thyself. But they also include the guidance of natural law \u2013 a real, transcendent moral order which flows from God\u2019s eternal law \u2013 the divine wisdom by which the whole of creation is ordered. The eternal law is impressed upon, and reflected in, all created things. From the nature of things we can, through reason, experience, discern standards of right and wrong that exist independent of human will.\n\nReligion, Barr said, provides us with moral laws, the violation of which \u201chave bad, real-world consequences for man and society.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe may not pay the price immediately, but over time the harm is real,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other words, religion helps frame moral culture within society that instills and reinforces moral discipline.\u201d\n\nBarr said religious liberty holds a place of priority in the Donald Trump administration and the Department of Justice.\n\nHe noted especially that his department looks for \u201ccases or events around the country where states are misapplying the Establishment Clause in a way that discriminates against people of faith, or cases where states adopt laws that impinge upon the free exercise of religion.\u201d\n\nThe attorney general explained that, today, \u201cmodern secularists\u201d are rejecting the morality instilled by faith as \u201cother-worldly superstition imposed by a kill-joy clergy.\u201d\n\nHe observed the destruction of American society and culture that has occurred at the same time religious freedom has come under attack by militant secularists:\n\nIn 1965, the illegitimacy rate was eight percent. In 1992, when I was last Attorney General, it was 25 percent. Today it is over 40 percent. In many of our large urban areas, it is around 70 percent. Along with the wreckage of the family, we are seeing record levels of depression and mental illness, dispirited young people, soaring suicide rates, increasing numbers of angry and alienated young males, an increase in senseless violence, and a deadly drug epidemic. As you all know, over 70,000 people die a year from drug overdoses. That is more casualties in a year than we experienced during the entire Vietnam War.\n\nBarr said \u201cthe campaign to destroy the traditional moral order has brought with it immense suffering, wreckage, and misery. And yet, the forces of secularism, ignoring these tragic results, press on with even greater militancy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmong these militant secularists are many so-called \u2018progressives,\u2019\u201d he observed. \u201cBut where is the progress?\u201d\n\nNothing from progressives has provided a replacement to fill the spiritual void of Americans, Barr observed, noting the ferocity of the assault on religion is not a sign of \u201cdecay,\u201d but, instead, \u201corganized destruction.\u201d\n\nHe warned against the complacent view that, after a while, the \u201cpendulum\u201d will simply \u201cswing back.\u201d\n\n\u201c[T]oday we face something different that may mean that we cannot count on the pendulum swinging back,\u201d Barr said, noting that secularists and progressives are engaged in an all-out assault on religion and traditional values through \u201cmass communications, popular culture, the entertainment industry, and academia.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese instruments are used not only to affirmatively promote secular orthodoxy, but also drown out and silence opposing voices, and to attack viciously and hold up to ridicule any dissenters,\u201d he explained, pointing out several areas in education where secularists are attacking. In particular, he noted:\n\nNew Jersey recently passed a law requiring public schools to adopt an LGBT curriculum that many feel is inconsistent with traditional Christian teaching. Similar laws have been passed in California and Illinois. And the Orange County Board of Education in California issued an opinion that \u201cparents who disagree with the instructional materials related to gender, gender identity, gender expression and sexual orientation may not excuse their children from this instruction.\u201d Indeed, in some cases, the schools may not even warn parents about lessons they plan to teach on controversial subjects relating to sexual behavior and relationships.\n\nBarr observed that as American culture has grown increasingly pathological, progressives and secularists have called on \u201cthe State\u201d to alleviate the problems associated with personal irresponsibility:\n\nSo, the reaction to growing illegitimacy is not sexual responsibility, but abortion. The reaction to drug addiction is safe injection sites. The solution to the breakdown of the family is for the State to set itself up as the ersatz husband for single mothers and the ersatz father to their children. The call comes for more and more social programs to deal with the wreckage. While we think we are solving problems, we are underwriting them. We start with an untrammeled freedom and we end up as dependents of a coercive state on which we depend.\n\nBarr said the progressive dream of \u201cthe State\u201d becoming the solver of all ills is in sharp contrast to what Christianity teaches \u2013 that \u201cwe transform the world by focusing on our own personal morality and transformation.\u201d\n\nThe attorney general urged Americans to ignore the temptation to sit back and wait for the \u201cpendulum\u201d of the nation\u2019s culture to swing back.\n\nBarr said by ensuring we instill our own faith principles in our daily actions and by educating our children in sound moral principles, we can \u201ctransform the world beyond ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot have a moral renaissance unless we succeed in passing to the next generation our faith and values in full vigor,\u201d he asserted.", "description": "Attorney General Barr observed America\u2019s Framers believed religious freedom is \u201cindispensable to sustaining a free system of government.\u201d", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AG-William-bill-Barr-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
