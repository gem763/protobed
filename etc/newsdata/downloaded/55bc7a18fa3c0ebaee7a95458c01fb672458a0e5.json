He\u2019s had it on the market since March, but wants to sell it to someone who won\u2019t convert the back yard into a car space, who wants to maintain the Saturday morning house tours that have attracted some 30,000 eco-curious visitors, and who will appreciate the home\u2019s unique perks: two resident Australorp chooks named Pesky and Blanche d\u2019Alpuget; less than $300 a year in water and energy bills for a family of four and a leafy street blooming with edible verge gardens.\n\nThe house also has a water, sewerage and electricity system completely disconnected from the mains: it is powered by solar panels and a battery storage system; clean drinking water falls on the roof and is then filtered for storage in an underground tank; and an aerated waste treatment system recycles all grey and blackwater, ensuring no raw sewage has left the premises in 23 years.\n\nWe are talking about 'drought-proofing' again \u2013 they are simplistic solutions that will destroy Australia | John Williams Read more\n\nMobbs is in no massive hurry to sell \u2013 he\u2019s yet to acquire that crucial plot of coastal land for his bolthole-to-be. However he does have a new abode in the works that is due for completion in December \u2013 a prefabricated, bushfire-proof, fully sustainable home constructed with recycled materials that he\u2019s creating in partnership with Melbourne-based modular housing specialists Fairweather Homes and Lismore-based renewables company 24 Hour Solar Power. Mobbs\u2019 new home will be the prototype the trio use to take on the mainstream building market, showing that sustainable can be both \u201cbeautiful and elegant\u201d and \u201ccheaper than business as usual\u201d.\n\n\u201cResilience and future proofing will be built in through an off-grid water and energy supply and robust materials suitable for extreme weather conditions,\u201d explains architect and Fairweather Homes director Paul Adam. \u201cWith the climate emergency in full swing we need to create solutions that are affordable and accessible and also make a positive contribution to preventing climate change.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a project that for Mobbs is part retirement nest egg, part departing gift to a decaying planet.\n\nMobbs has narrowed the location for his new home to two sites in Australia: south-west Western Australia and Bermagui on the New South Wales south coast, both chosen because, to put it simply, \u201cwherever there are trees, there is rainfall\u201d. There are, of course, other strategic considerations (but more on that later).\n\nFirst Mobbs has to do something he\u2019s been deferring for a while: go \u201cpublic\u201d. Coming out as a survivalist who is abandoning the urban world is no easy step for a man who has authored two bestselling books on sustainable city living, spent two decades as a consultant to the public and private sector, lectured at universities, and has a model of his eco-friendly terrace home exhibited at Sydney\u2019s Powerhouse Museum. Even his two adult children, who he says remain frustratingly indifferent to the apocalypse, aren\u2019t fully across his intentions. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to crabwalk into this conversation with my children,\u201d he says, sighing. \u201cThe idea that life won\u2019t go on for them in the same way it has gone on for me is incomprehensible.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Mobbs in the back garden of his 19th century Sydney home. The house, which is for sale, comes with or without the two chickens. Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian\n\nMobbs has chosen the night before September\u2019s global climate strike to speak his truth at a \u201ctalk and feast\u201d event organised by the community group Transition Bondi. They have invited Mobbs to speak as part of a four-person panel on the topic, \u201cWhat is your response to climate change?\u201d\n\nAs soup is served, a real-life emergency is unfolding in the kitchen. An overheated kettle has triggered the fire alarm, forcing everyone to file out of the Margaret Whitlam Recreation Centre at Waverley Oval to the repetitive strains of \u201cEmergency, emergency! Evacuate now!\u201d\n\nWhen the kettle has finally been pacified, Mobbs and the panel take their positions. Mobbs is no stranger to public speaking \u2013 quick with a quip and with a lawyer\u2019s gift for the gab \u2013 but tonight he\u2019s nervous, clutching printed notes which he reads from slowly.\n\n\u201cMy guess is water, energy, food, the seasons and economies will collapse in the next three to five years,\u201d he says. \u201cAm I certain of these things? No. But like someone diagnosed with a cancer expected to kill me in the next five years, I am now preparing for my personal circumstances over the next few years. The star I steer by is an article by Catherine Ingram, Facing Extinction.\u201d\n\nPeople seem to believe that if they have superannuation, climate change won\u2019t apply to them Michael Mobbs\n\nThe audience \u2013 who were hoping for a side of hope with their vegan meal \u2013 appear stunned. Mobbs, on the other hand, looks relieved.\n\nSpeaking to Guardian Australia in the days leading up to and following his big reveal, Mobbs admits he sometimes has moments of doubt, where he wonders if he\u2019s just catastrophising. But he reserves most of his incredulity for people who refuse to believe it could happen here.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t debate it any more \u2013 it\u2019s just a waste of time. What they\u2019re saying is: \u2018I find this too hard to talk about. I don\u2019t want to listen to your point of view,\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nIt reminds him of the resistance he encountered when he took his inner-city home off grid \u2013 the naysayers, the builders, the hydraulic engineers, the local government officials who said it could never be done.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A model of Mobb\u2019s sustainable terrace home is part of the permanent exhibition at Sydney\u2019s Powerhouse Museum.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting near the fireplace in Mobbs\u2019 Myrtle Street terrace looking out through large glass doors to the landscaped back garden with its small beehive, kumquat trees and homes for micro bats. Mobbs is talking about \u201ccollapse\u201d, which he fears, when it strikes, could unfold very quickly.\n\n\u201cI want to get away from the major cities because I think they\u2019ll become unsafe. You look at what happens in places that get cyclones or tornadoes; when the food runs out and it\u2019s hard to get power and water, civil unrest happens in about two or three days,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cPeople die without food and water in a week, and if there are a lot of people dying or at risk of dying, their behaviour will become uncontrollable.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A hive of activity in Michael Mobbs\u2019 back yard. Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian\n\nThe nation-state, he believes, won\u2019t come to the rescue. \u201cThey will look after themselves and their own. They will appropriate resources to protect their own entitlements. They won\u2019t look after the people who voted for them.\u201d\n\nEven this Sydney house won\u2019t withstand the coming crisis, Mobbs says \u2013 a point, I suggest, he probably shouldn\u2019t stress to a prospective buyer.\n\nHe throws his head back and laughs. \u201cI suppose I could put up a warning note: \u2018Staying here is life-threatening.\u2019\u201d\n\nStill, he believes those in the city who are more self-sufficient, including the future occupants of this house, will have an advantage. \u201c[But desperate people] will come here for the water and the energy,\u201d he says, adding drily: \u201cMaybe I should sell it with guns.\u201d\n\nWhen, or if, such a situation arises, Mobbs wants to be well off the radar. Does he see himself as a doomsday prepper?\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m looking after me \u2013 I want to survive. I doubt that I will because it\u2019s hard to say where the water will or won\u2019t fall.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to find somewhere, where even if the great conveyor belt does break down while I\u2019m alive, there are enough trees to out-arm wrestle the ocean and retain the rainfall.\u201d\n\nHow the climate crisis will affect you \u2013 interactive map Read more\n\nEnter Bermagui, the frontrunner for his haven from climate disaster. The town of 1,500 people flanked by ocean and forest and midway between Sydney and Melbourne first came to his attention during a chance encounter with chef turned urban farmer Paul West, who hosts the Foxtel series River Cottage Australia.\n\n\u201cWe did this gig together for Whitehorse City Council [in Melbourne]. Within 10 minutes we were talking like you and I were talking. He said \u2018I\u2019m moving out of my Melbourne house and back to Bermagui.\u2019 He said \u2018Come to Bermagui. It\u2019s got two wooden bridges which could be burned down should the town need defending.\u2019 I thought, \u2018This is my man!\u2019\u201d\n\nMobbs\u2019 annihilation anxiety can be traced back to his childhood. He grew up on a farm downstream from Forbes in the NSW central west. When he was six the Lachlan River flooded, cutting him and his family off from the world for four months, leaving them reliant on food drops from a Gypsy Moth biplane. It was young Mobbs\u2019 first \u201cexperience of the power of water\u201d, giving him an enduring \u201crespect for the unpredictability of the weather\u201d.\n\nA number of factors coalesced in the last year to rekindle Mobb\u2019s unease. With his children flown the coop and his marriage long over, he decided to rent out his Chippendale home for a year and relocate to Bondi Beach so he could swim in the ocean at dawn and \u201csee who I was when I wasn\u2019t that guy in that house\u201d.\n\nThree months after the move the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its dire report warning the world only had 12 years to avert a climate catastrophe.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to work out how to live in the face of impending collapse. Michael Mobbs\n\nStanding at sunrise on the golden strip of sand that lures millions of people each year, Mobbs saw a culture that \u201csimply can\u2019t be sustained\u201d.\n\n\u201cBondi is a kind of Andy Warhol picture writ large of good figures and narcissism at every second step,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I found [my sustainable house] was put in perspective, I saw myself as quite an aberration \u2013 just alone with millions of people who have no concept of what the realities are and think that they have time ... They seem to believe that if they have superannuation, climate change won\u2019t apply to them.\u201d\n\nDuring that year Mobbs also took a 4,352km train trip from Perth to Sydney, a journey he describes as \u201cjust four days of dying countryside\u201d. \u201cI travelled through Western Australia across the Nullarbor, through South Australia, down through Broken Hill \u2013 the whole of the country is abandoned and dying,\u201d he says.\n\nThat the mighty, flood-prone Lachlan River of his youth has now been projected by WaterNSW to run dry by March 2020 given no significant rain or government intervention, fills Mobbs with a grave fear.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Mobbs with his home\u2019s inverter, which manages inputs from the solar panels and batteries. Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian\n\nWhen NSW premier Bob Carr opened Mobbs\u2019 sustainable house on 9 December 1996, he declared Sydney\u2019s first self-sufficient home \u201ca vision of the future\u201d.\n\nIndeed, at last count, more than 20% of Australian homes were fitted with solar panels; this year\u2019s national Sustainable House Day saw 252 homes open their doors to the public; and NSW now has a building sustainability index (Basix) that regulates the energy and water efficiency of new dwellings.\n\n'I don't know how we come back from this': Australia's big dry sucks life from once-proud towns Read more\n\nIn those two decades Mobbs has had significant wins against the state, including Sydney Water, which for years after he\u2019d disconnected his home from the sewage and water mains continued to send him bills (when he didn\u2019t pay up, he says, they threatened to disconnect him). \u201c[Eventually] they came round and did a smoke test. And their faces fell,\u201d he says, grinning.\n\nBut Mobbs is still locked in an ideological battle with Sydney Water, which he sees as prioritising desalination plants over home rainwater tanks and wastewater recycling systems. The dwindling H2O levels in his own underground storage system is a daily reminder of the city\u2019s water insecurity \u2013 in recent years he\u2019s had to increasingly rely on his neighbour\u2019s garden hose to top up his tank. The latest worst-case scenario projection from WaterNSW is that Warragamba Dam \u2013 Sydney\u2019s primary water supply \u2013 will stop flowing by January 2022.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done my best here and it hasn\u2019t been enough,\u201d Mobbs says of his Sydney ecohome. \u201cI see what I\u2019ve done as a failure. Not a tragic failure \u2013 I mean it\u2019s changed things such as building regulations \u2026 This house has brought more change than political argument has. I\u2019ve given up political strategising. The political process is just too slow for the problems we face. I\u2019m hoping if we can do a good job with this [prefabricated sustainable home] project, we can achieve change.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018This house has brought more change than political argument has\u2019: Mobbs in his kitchen. Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian\n\nNext week Mobbs will jump on a bus (he doesn\u2019t own a car) at Central Station and travel eight hours south of Sydney to Bermagui to look for land to buy and establish contacts in a patch of NSW he foresees will be his next home.\n\n\u201cIs Bermagui somewhere I want to go?\u201d he says. \u201cSort of yes, sort of no. Somebody gave the analogy of the Jews in Germany [before the Holocaust]. They said there were three types of Jews: those who said \u2018We can\u2019t trust [Hitler], we\u2019re leaving.\u2019 There were people who said \u2018I think we can manage him and bring him round.\u2019 There were others who said \u2018It\u2019ll never happen to us, we\u2019ll be right.\u2019 And the same forms of denial and acceptance are in the conversations I\u2019m having now.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to work out how to live in the face of impending collapse and my solution \u2013 aside from whisky and wine and gardening \u2013 is to do things that have meaning for others and to show faith that it\u2019s possible to do this stuff.\u201d\n\n***\n\nOne September evening, Sydney\u2019s long dry spell breaks. Days of downpours follow, during which Mobbs monitors with a childlike joy as his 10,000 litre back yard inner-city rainwater tank fills to 96% capacity.\n\nOne morning that week I receive an email. \u201cBeautiful sound of rain on my tin roof as I write this. More than ever the sound is so gratifying,\u201d he says.\n\nHe signs off the email with a simple message, but on that saturated morning it rings like a prayer for a parched country.\n\n\u201cMay the raindrops be with you.\u201d", "description": "The man who wrote the book on living off-grid in the city plans to retreat to a rural bolthole, saying eco-friendly progress has not kept pace with the speed of climate collapse", "authors": ["Janine Israel"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc2b6ae55118d65e5ed3a70fda5009881aa39224/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dce40841deb365198f734347ac805276", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
