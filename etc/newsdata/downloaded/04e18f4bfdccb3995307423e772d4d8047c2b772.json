The trailer shows Robbie\u2019s character joining up with female DC favorites like the Huntress, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Black Canary, played by Jurnee Smollett-Bell.\n\nAs you can see from the video above, Quinn not only chops off her hair but reveals she has cut her boyfriend/master the Joker out of her life.\n\n\u201cThe Joker and I broke up. I wanted a fresh start,\u201d she says in the voice-over. \u201cBut it turns out, I wasn\u2019t the only dame in Gotham looking for emancipation.\u201d\n\nAlthough Jared Leto \u2015 who played the Joker in the first \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d film \u2015 isn\u2019t listed as a cast member, CinemaBlend.com speculates there will be an Easter egg suggesting Batman\u2019s biggest foe is still part of the franchise.\n\n\u201cBirds of Prey\u201d is scheduled to open in theaters Feb. 7.", "description": "In the trailer, Harley Quinn not only chops off her hair but reveals she has cut her boyfriend the Joker out of her life.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d93959c2100002d00f91aef.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
