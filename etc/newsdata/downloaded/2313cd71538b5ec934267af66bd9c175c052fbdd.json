Marco Rubio at the 75th General Assembly of the Inter American Press Association (IAPA), in Coral Gables, Fla., Sunday. (Cristobal Herrera/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nRepublican Sen. Marco Rubio on Wednesday asked the U.S. government to open an investigation into TikTok, the wildly popular, Chinese-owned social media app, out of concern that the company is \u201ccensoring content\u201d around the world to satisfy Beijing\u2019s leaders.\n\nRubio (Fla.) requested a broad investigation into the company from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, which oversees foreign acquisitions for national security concerns. In 2017, TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, purchased Musical.ly, which had a presence and user base in the United States, and later merged it with its own offering, creating the social media behemoth that has been installed by more than 1 billion people globally.\n\nIn his letter Wednesday to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Rubio requested a full review of the national security implications of TikTok\u2019s acquisition. \u201cThe Chinese government\u2019s nefarious efforts to censor information inside free societies around the world cannot be accepted and pose serious long-term challenges to the U.S. and our allies,\u201d he wrote.\n\nToday I will be asking CFIUS to review #TikTok\u2019s acquisition of https://t.co/0wGGsvV96T.\n\n\n\nAmple & growing evidence exists that TikTok\u2019s platform for western markets, including the U.S., are censoring content in line with #China\u2019s communist government directives. \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 9, 2019\n\nIn a series of tweets, Rubio added that he has asked the Trump administration to \u201cfully enforce anti-boycott laws\u201d that prohibit any person or \u201cU.S. subsidiaries of Chinese companies\u201d from \u201ccomplying with foreign boycotts seeking to coerce U.S. companies to conform with #China\u2019s government views.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s call follows a firestorm of recent criticism aimed at both Chinese censors and U.S. companies that have penalized people for voicing support for protests in Hong Kong, in hopes of avoiding the wrath of the government of the world\u2019s second-largest economy. China sanctioned the National Basketball Association this week after a team leader posted a message supporting the protests, and the California-based video-game giant Blizzard Entertainment suspended a professional esports player for shouting \u201cLiberate Hong Kong\u201d during an interview.\n\n[China lashes out at Western businesses as it tries to cut support for Hong Kong protests]\n\nTikTok\u2019s lack of content related to the Hong Kong protests, which Chinese leaders have pushed to undermine, has raised fears that the platform is censoring ideas the government wants to suppress. In response, TikTok\u2019s Beijing-based parent company told The Washington Post last month that the app\u2019s U.S. platform was not influenced by the Chinese government, and that the lack of protest footage could be related to users\u2019 view of the app as a place for entertainment, not politics. It declined to share any additional details about its content-moderation practices.\n\nA spokesperson for TikTok did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. The Treasury Department also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRubio\u2019s quest for a CFIUS probe could resonate with the White House in the midst of its trade war with China, which has started to strain both countries\u2019 economies. Last month, the Trump administration proposed new rules that would enhance the powers of CFIUS, particularly with an eye on scrutinizing Chinese investment in areas including technology.\n\n[TikTok\u2019s Beijing roots fuel censorship suspicion as it builds a huge U.S. audience]\n\nTikTok content-moderation guidelines, revealed last month by the Guardian, showed that the app banned criticism of the Chinese government and discussion of historic events such as the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, during which the Chinese military killed thousands of people amid pro-democracy protests.\n\nA TikTok spokesperson said the rules were no longer in use and reflected the app\u2019s early days, when the company \u201ctook a blunt approach to minimizing conflict on the platform.\u201d The spokesperson said the company understood \u201cthe need to be more transparent\u201d in communicating its policies but has declined repeatedly to share its current guidelines for deciding which content is permitted or suppressed.\n\nSome business and technology analysts share Rubio\u2019s views, worrying that an encroachment of Chinese government control could threaten traditionally Western values supporting creative expression and freedom of speech. Technology analyst Ben Thompson said Tuesday that CFIUS should revisit TikTok\u2019s Musical.ly acquisition and that \u201cthe current skepticism around all Chinese investment in the United States should be continued if not increased.\u201d\n\n\u201cAttempts by China to leverage market access into self-censorship by U.S. companies should also be treated as trade violations that are subject to retaliation,\u201d he wrote in his blog Stratechery. \u201cMake no mistake, what happened to the NBA this weekend is nothing new: similar pressure has befallen multiple U.S. companies, often about content that is outside of China\u2019s borders.\u201d", "description": "Republican Sen.
