Because a strong surplus was needed to guard against economic shocks.\n\n\"The whiff of a surplus, not reaching at least 1 per cent of GDP until 2026-27, does not adequately protect Australia against the potential roiling seas of international uncertainty,'' Bowen said in an earlier speech.\n\nAs it happened, the day before Bowen released his costings, which was just over a week from polling day, Scott Morrison called the election result.\n\n\"We are going to win this election,'' Morrison told a seniors forum in NSW, adding that millions of \"quiet Australians\" did not want the upheaval Labor was offering.\n\nHe was right then, and right now those millions of quiet Australians are looking to the government for salvation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn just five months, the economic reality has forced a meeting of minds between the major parties on how to manage the economy. Everyone agrees on the need for stimulus and surpluses. The big difference is when to do what. and by how much.\n\nWhen the International Monetary Fund downgraded Australian and global growth forecasts this week, we went through what has now become a familiar refrain when bad economic news surfaces: Labor and business groups call for extra measures to stimulate the economy while the government digs in behind its plans to return to surplus and insists current policy settings - including the first round of tax cuts rolled out on July 1, and the infrastructure spending - are adequate for now.\n\nWe really don't want to do anything this side of the budget. \u2014 Government source\n\nThe government's strong inclination is to do nothing extra before the budget in May next year.\n\n\"We really don't want to do anything this side of the budget,'' said one source familiar with internal deliberations.\n\nLabor believes the government is being too cautious and its gamble to hold out will backfire.\n\nThe government believes Labor is overstating the situation. After all, this is not a crisis per se like the global financial crisis in which the economy needed CPR.\n\nThe government's leadership group met this week to discuss the situation and provide mutual reassurance that everyone was holding their nerve against the growing clamour for action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe unemployment figures released Thursday gave the government further confidence it did not need to jump early. But does that mean contingencies are not being considered.\n\nWith each IMF report or interest rate cut, the pressure builds for measures to be included in the mid-year budget update, or MYEFO.\n\nTo its credit, the Coalition, since coming to office in 2013, has released MYEFO in the week before Christmas.\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg flagged recently that the May budget would include an investment allowance, a sort of turbocharged instant write-off scheme to boost the business investment for which the Treasurer has been calling. Alex Ellinghausen\n\nThis discipline, a trademark of Mathias Cormann, who became Australia's longest serving Finance Minister this month, means the update is as close to the middle of the financial year as possible and comes after the release in early December of the growth figures for the September quarter.\n\nLabor when last in government was never so disciplined. It once brought MYEFO forward to early October so it would not have to include figures which showed its mining tax was raising no revenue.\n\nThe government is banking on its July 1 tax cuts and the June and July rate cuts stimulating the September quarter so it does not have to bring forward any stimulus measures from the May budget to MYEFO and threaten the surplus.\n\nThat said, views inside government are not overly optimistic, with expectations the September number will not be much better than the annual 1.4 per cent growth rate that was recorded for the June quarter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomewhere between 1.4 per cent and 1.8 per cent is the current expectation inside government for the September quarter. We will get an indication when the Reserve Bank issues its own forecasts early next month.\n\nIn recent weeks, both Scott Morrison and Cormann, while adamant the tax and rate cuts will ward off the need for any action before May, have both left open the option of doing something in MYEFO, just in case.\n\nGiven there is only about two weeks between the release of the September quarter figures and MYEFO, any government worth its salt would be doing the policy work now in case a contingency was needed.\n\nIn the post-election spirit of ripping off each other's ideas on the economy, Josh Frydenberg flagged recently that the May budget would include an investment allowance, a sort of turbocharged instant write-off scheme to boost the business investment for which the Treasurer has been calling.\n\nSuch a scheme was another of Bowen's ideas. He pitched it as an alternative to cutting the company tax rate and because he was among those inside Labor who was cognisant of the need for a growth agenda.\n\nFrydenberg was coy this week when asked whether that policy, which will differ in substance but not style to that proposed by Labor, would be ready by MYEFO just in case.\n\nIt's hard to believe they won't have something up their sleeve just in case. It would be irresponsible to do otherwise.", "description": "The government is determined to wait until the May 2020 budget before announcing any economic stimulus.
