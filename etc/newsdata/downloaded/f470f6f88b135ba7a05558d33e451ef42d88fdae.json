The menu item, which is available for limited runs at select stores and has a cult-like fanbase ready and ravenous for the meat sandwich, was last seen on the menu in November. It rolled out to more than 9,000 of the country\u2019s 14,000 McDonald\u2019s locations in 2018, but will top out at 10,000 this year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always listening to our customers and we know the McRib has some of the most loyal fans,\" Chad Schafer, senior director of culinary innovation for McDonald\u2019s USA, said in a statement.\n\nAnd the strategy is already working as social media users are definitely excited about the McRib\u2019s comeback:\n\nCan\u2019t wait for Monday!!

However, the McRib is back.\n\n\n\nAll is well in the world today. \u2014 Tony Deppen (@Tony_Deppen) October 4, 2019\n\nSo what makes the sandwich so popular? The McRib is a boneless pork chop \u201cslathered in tangy barbecue sauce and topped with slivered onions and tart pickles, all on a hoagie style bun\u201d and altogether contains about 45 ingredients, according to the nutritional information, and contains 480 calories, 22 grams of fat, 45 grams of carbohydrates, 24 grams of protein, 890 milligrams of sodium and 12 grams of sugar.\n\n\u201c...there are a lot of preservatives and highly processed ingredients present,\u201d registered dietitian Beth Warren told Yahoo Lifestyle, partly explaining the taste. \u201cAlso, there is added sugar in the bread and the grains are refined. Overall, this points to the sandwich being pro-inflammatory, especially if eaten in excess and over time.\u201d\n\nMcDonald\u2019s also announced the return of their McCafe Donut Sticks, which will be accompanied by a new chocolate dipping sauce, with the sweet treats becoming available in November. Additionally, McDonald\u2019s will introduce its first seasonal drink, the McCaf\u00e9 Cinnamon Cookie Latte, which will be available in both hot and cold. The drink will arrive just in time for the holiday season and be around for a short run starting Nov. 6.\n\nMarking experts explained that the seasonal item is an important tool in the food industry as it provides incentive to consumers. \"When you have these exclusive products, which exist for a short period of time, it gives people a reason to come to the store,\" Alexander Chernev a professor of marketing at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management explained to CNN Business.\n\nCheck out this tracker to find a McRib near you!\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "McDonald's announced Thursday that their popular sandwich will return Oct. 7 and be available at more locations than ever before.", "authors": ["Megan Sims"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cdJPfznke1PzTq0GhlWjMA--~B/aD0yNDE3O3c9MzU2NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/c3d046d0-e6fa-11e9-b5b4-5929d709f494", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
