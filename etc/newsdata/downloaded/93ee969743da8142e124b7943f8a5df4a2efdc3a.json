Colonel Vindman told investigators that at the point of the transcript where the third set of ellipses appears, Mr. Trump said there were tapes of Mr. Biden.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s mention of tapes is an apparent reference to Mr. Biden\u2019s comments at a January 2018 event about his effort to get Ukraine to force out its prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin. Supporters of Mr. Biden have said Mr. Shokin was widely criticized for his lax anti-corruption efforts. Republicans charge, without evidence, that Mr. Biden was trying to stop an investigation into his son.\n\nColonel Vindman told House investigators Tuesday that he twice registered internal objections about how Mr. Trump and his inner circle were pressuring Ukraine to undertake inquiries beneficial to the president, including of Mr. Biden. After the July 25 call, the colonel reported what happened to a superior, explaining that \u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\u201d according to his opening remarks. He added, \u201cThis would all undermine U.S. national security.\u201d\n\nHe also described confronting Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, after the envoy pressed Ukrainian officials to help the Trump administration by investigating the Biden family. The colonel said he acted out of a \u201csense of duty,\u201d and emphasized his military service in his remarks. \u201cI am a patriot,\u201d he said, \u201cand it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend our country irrespective of party or politics.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke, House leaders were preparing for what was expected to be significant new private testimony from current and former White House officials in the coming days. On Wednesday, they will hear from two Ukraine experts who advised Kurt D. Volker, the former United States special envoy to the country. On Thursday, Timothy Morrison, the National Security Council\u2019s Russia and Europe director, is scheduled to testify. And on Friday, investigators have called Robert Blair, a top national security adviser to Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff.", "description": "Lt. Col. Alexander S.
