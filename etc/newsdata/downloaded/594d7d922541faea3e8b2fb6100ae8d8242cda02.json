Let's hope that Friday's protests are handled properly \u2014 are handled in a way that will retain peace and stability in the country. I don't want to destabilize this situation any further, my friend.\u201d\n\nWhen pushed, he finally said, \u201cI do expect him to stay.\u201d\n\nMahdi noted that Friday\u2019s protest would be \"quite a key test for the government and for the country\" and that \"there are measures to make sure that what happened the last time will not be repeated again.\"", "description": "Iraq has been reeling from anti-government protests, including one on Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/9stjifHG7I1kztKwroNJwIT561I=/0x0:738x415/1920x1080/2019/10/27/1572210769099.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
