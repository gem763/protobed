But after several chaotic weeks the attempted coalition-building collapsed into recriminations.\n\nOn the surface was a dispute over Israel's secular versus its religious character, says the BBC's Tom Bateman in Jerusalem.\n\nBut ultimately, our correspondent adds, Mr Netanyahu's problems stemmed from a narrowing range of options to build a governing bloc, weakened as he is by the charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust he faces in three corruption cases, pending a final hearing. He has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nWhat is Netanyahu's pitch to voters this time?\n\nThroughout the campaign he has made ever more strident appeals to the right wing.\n\nLast week, Mr Netanyahu declared he would \"apply Israeli sovereignty\" in the Jordan Valley if he won a record fifth term in office. The announcement amounted to a promise to effectively annex 30% of the occupied West Bank, which Palestinians want to be part of a future state.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Is Palestinian-Israel peace plan out of reach?\n\nAmid international condemnation, the Palestinian leadership called the move a war crime which would bury any prospects for peace.\n\nMr Netanyahu also reiterated a pledge from the last election to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.\n\n\"We find ourselves at the high point of an historic change in the history of the Jewish people and the State of Israel,\" Mr Netanyahu wrote in the Maariv newspaper on Monday.\n\n\"I am asking now for your confidence in order to complete the historic task and fortify the State of Israel's borders and security forever.\"\n\nUS President Donald Trump's long-awaited plan for a peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians is expected to be published soon after the election.\n\nWhat has Benny Gantz promised?\n\nMr Netanyahu faces an emergent centrist alliance studded with retired generals, who say they will end Israel's increasing divisions. Blue and White was founded in February by Mr Gantz and Yair Lapid, a former finance minister and leader of the Yesh Atid party.\n\nWriting in the Hebrew-language daily newspaper Maariv, Mr Gantz said a victory for Blue and White would \"change the direction of the ship of state of Israeli democracy\".\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption There are more than 6 million eligible voters in Israel\n\n\"No more instigating rifts in an attempt to divide and conquer, but rather quick action to form a unity government,\" he wrote. \"No looking out for the interests of pressure groups, but rather a government that looks out for the majority of Israeli citizens.\"\n\nIt is not clear where Mr Gantz stands on Mr Netanyahu's plan to annex Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley. He has not said whether or not he accepts the idea of a Palestinian state, although he rejects withdrawing from all of the West Bank.\n\nWhy could smaller parties be key?\n\nThe final polls suggested no clear route to government for either Mr Netanyahu or Mr Gantz.\n\nAvigdor Lieberman, an ally-turned-rival of the prime minister and leader of the right-wing secular Yisrael Beiteinu party, could end up holding the balance of power.\n\nHe prevented Mr Netanyahu from forming a coalition after the last election because he refused to back down in a longstanding dispute with religious parties over a bill governing exemptions from military service for ultra-Orthodox young men.\n\nMr Lieberman has said the only way he will help return Mr Netanyahu to office after Tuesday's vote is if Likud agrees to a secular unity government and shares power with Blue and White - something the prime minister has ruled out.", "description": "A former military chief is seeking to unseat Israel's prime minister in a race too close to call.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/CBAE/production/_108824125_mediaitem108824121.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
