Duncan Hunter for a Southern California seat.\n\nIssa says on his website that he formed an exploratory committee to replace fellow Republican Hunter, who is scheduled to be tried in January for allegedly siphoning campaign money for personal use. The committee allows Issa to raise money.\n\nIssa would bring strong name recognition, deep pockets and a reputation as President Barack Obama\u2019s chief antagonist in Congress to what has been a safe Republican seat largely in San Diego County.\n\nIssa announced his retirement before the 2018 election. The seat he held in northern San Diego County was won by Democrat Mike Levin.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Former California Congressman Darrell Issa has taken a step toward challenging indicted U.S. Rep.
