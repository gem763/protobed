A gauge of oil-market volatility hit its highest level since December of last year, and trading activity showed investors expect higher prices in coming months.\n\nBrent crude, the international benchmark, settled at $69.02 a barrel, rising $8.80, or 14.6%, its biggest one-day percentage gain since at least 1988. Brent futures saw more than 2 million contracts traded, an all-time daily volume record, Intercontinental Exchange spokeswoman Rebecca Mitchell said.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures ended at $62.90 a barrel, soaring $8.05, or 14.7% - the biggest one-day percentage gain since December 2008.\n\n\u201cThe attack on Saudi oil infrastructure came as a shock and a surprise,\u201d said Tony Headrick, an energy market analyst at St. Paul, Minnesota, commodity brokerage CHS Hedging LLC. \u201cI think the tables abruptly shifted in the way of the supply outlook and caught many who were short off-guard.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia is the world\u2019s biggest oil exporter and, with its comparatively large spare capacity, has been the supplier of last resort for decades.\n\nThe weekend attack on state-owned producer Saudi Aramco\u2019s crude-processing facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais cut output by 5.7 million barrels per day and threw into question its ability to maintain oil exports. The company has not given a specific timeline for the resumption of full output.\n\nTwo sources briefed on Aramco\u2019s operations said a full return to normal production \u201cmay take months.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there really is enough to offset what is going to be offline here for a period of time, and you don\u2019t even know the quantity of time,\u201d said Joe McMonigle, energy analyst at Hedgeye Research.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials said Monday that evidence pointed to Iran being behind the attack, raising the specter of a response that could further unsettle world markets and global supply.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he was in \u201cno rush\u201d to respond, however, as he awaited more details. That marked a shift in tone from a tweet sent by Trump on Sunday, when he said the United States was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d and ready to respond..\n\nThe Chicago Board Options Exchange\u2019s Crude Oil Volatility Index, a gauge of options premiums based on moves in the U.S. oil exchange traded fund, rose to 77.17, its highest level since December last year.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Global oil prices spike over 10% after attacks on Saudi Arabia oil facilities - tmsnrt.rs/31CeWsA)\n\nThe attacks and subsequent hit to supply are likely to keep prices elevated for some time. Crude cargo booking activity and freight rates for shipments from the U.S. Gulf Coast rose over the weekend and on Monday, a ship broker said, and regional Gulf crude prices traded over-the-counter were higher in anticipation of bids for more U.S. shipments.\n\nThe United States exports about 3 million barrels of oil a day and could boost those shipments further.\n\nMajor importers of Saudi crude, such as India, China, Japan and South Korea, will be the most vulnerable to any supply disruption. South Korea has already said it would consider releasing oil from its strategic reserves.\n\nTrump approved the release of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which holds more than 640 million barrels of crude oil.\n\nSaudi oil exports will continue as normal this week as the kingdom taps into stocks from its large storage facilities, an industry source briefed on the developments told Reuters. Still, the attack has raised concerns about how long the kingdom will be able to maintain oil shipments and launched a scramble by refiners in leading Asian consumer countries to find alternatives.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Oil pump jacks work at sunset near Midland, Texas, U.S., August 21, 2019.
