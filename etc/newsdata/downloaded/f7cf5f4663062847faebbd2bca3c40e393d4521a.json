Meanwhile, the impact of a potential White House win for Sen. Elizabeth Warren -- now in focus among investors -- would likely be \u201cneutral for Wex,\u201d Smith said on Wednesday, adding \u201cwe\u2019re not a bank.\u201d\n\nPortland, Maine-based Wex, with a market cap of about $9 billion, offers payment services for private and government fleets, and for travel and insurance companies. It also provides management services for healthcare benefits.\n\nConsumer confidence may be hurting businesses, Smith said. She noted that the small fleet owner sector has had difficulty, with a glut of vehicle inventory. There\u2019s also been a little softness in travel, she said.\n\nAny changes in the health insurance industry after the 2020 election may not influence WEX\u2019s position, she said, as \u201ceven progressive Democrats offer accounts\u201d as part of their plans.\n\nWex\u2019s shares have rallied 50% this year, versus a 58% jump for FleetCor Technologies Inc., which also operates in the fleet payments arena, and a 16% gain for the S&P Midcap 400 index.\n\nWex has neither joined nor abandoned other payments companies in Facebook Inc.\u2019s digital currency effort Libra, Smith said. Wex works on blockchain, but has steered clear of cryptocurrencies as the \u201cregulatory environment seems like it needs to be ironed out,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd Wex has been active in making acquisitions and continues to seek deals, particularly to boost scale, technology and geographic diversity, Smith added. Wex said last week that it entered the Middle Eastern payments market to issue virtual cards in the United Arab Emirates, in partnership with Mastercard Inc. In July, Wex completed the acquisition of the Go Fuel Card business headquartered in Breda, Netherlands. Wex management said the brand has about 200,000 cars in circulation.\n\nIn August, Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s David Ritter said WEX\u2019s Travel and Corporate Payments segment should continue to bolster revenue growth this year after double-digit expansion in 2018, as the company may gain market share in high-growth areas of B2B payments. He saw gains in the fuel-card business persisting in 2019, partly due to new products and large new partnerships with Shell and Chevron. He also noted double-digit gains in U.S. healthcare revenue.\n\nAnd, as a public company, Wex is itself \u201cfor sale every day,\u201d Smith said.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Felice Maranz in New York at fmaranz@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Will Daley, Jennifer Bissell-Linsk\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Business-to-business payments company Wex Inc. is \u201cbracing for volatility\u201d in 2020, ahead of the U.S. election and as business volume is \u201cjust a hair soft,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Melissa Smith said in an interview.While market sentiment was \u201cgangbusters\u201d last year, Smith said she has", "authors": ["Felice Maranz"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
