(Daniel Mihailescu/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\n\nBREAKING NEWS: The State Department has directed Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, not to appear before House committees seeking information about his activities, according to a statement by his attorney.\n\nSondland was scheduled to be deposed about his activities as President Trump urged Ukraine to investigate his political opponents.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nGordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, who has emerged as a central figure in the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, will be deposed by lawmakers Tuesday about his activities as President Trump urged Ukraine to investigate his political opponents.\n\nText messages made public last week show that Sondland, whose portfolio does not include U.S.-Ukraine relations, inserted himself into the effort to obtain a commitment from Ukraine to launch the investigations. At the time, the government in Kiev was eagerly awaiting the release of nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid and the arrangement of a face-to-face meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nIn one text message, Sondland wrote that Trump \u201creally wants the deliverable,\u201d referring to a clear demonstration from Ukraine that it would undertake the investigations.\n\n[Officials\u2019 texts reveal belief that Trump wanted probes as condition of Ukraine meeting]\n\nSondland worked closely with Kurt Volker, the U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, to shape U.S. foreign policy around Trump\u2019s desire to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, as well as an unsubstantiated theory that Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 presidential election to undermine Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\nLawmakers heard last week from Volker after he resigned his position and turned over his communications to Congress. Sondland remains in his post and has turned over the documents that lawmakers want to the State Department instead, setting up a fight between the legislative and executive branches over access to the information.\n\n[Holding Ukraine hostage: How the president and his allies, chasing 2020 ammunition, fanned a political storm]\n\nSondland, 61, appears never to have held a position in government before being named the ambassador to the E.U. in June 2018. He built his fortune acquiring and managing luxury hotels in the Pacific Northwest and gave $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund via shell companies that obscured his involvement.\n\nThe text messages released last week show what appear to be Sondland\u2019s effort to minimize political fallout from the administration\u2019s dealings with the Ukrainians.\n\nOn Sept. 9, William B. \u201cBill\u201d Taylor, the senior U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, texted Sondland: \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nHours later, Sondland, who had been aggressively pursuing a public agreement for Ukraine to launch the investigations, replied, \u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d", "description": "Text messages show that Sondland, the ambassador to the E.U., was shaping U.S. foreign policy in Ukraine as Trump pressed for investigations of his political opponents.", "authors": ["Shane Harris", "Intelligence", "National Security Reporter", "October At Am", "Shane Harris Covers Intelligence", "National Security For The Post.
