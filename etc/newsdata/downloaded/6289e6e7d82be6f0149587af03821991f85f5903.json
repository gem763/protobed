We should be able to keep the plans we like and the doctors we trust. Government-run health care does the exact opposite.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith this legislation, the Left acknowledges that Obamacare failed but now demands a government takeover of our health care system.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe national anxiety created by Obamacare\u2014which resulted in massive premium increases, higher health care costs, and fewer coverage options\u2014will not be solved by doubling down on government control.\n\n\n\n\u201cOther countries with government-run health care have experienced frustrating wait times for basic medical care and sometimes dangerous delays in critical treatments and surgeries. We also know that government control over health care would require crushing individual tax increases, only to be trapped in an inferior system with no option to escape.\n\n\n\n\u201cInstead of putting government bureaucrats in charge of our health care, we should empower the people.
