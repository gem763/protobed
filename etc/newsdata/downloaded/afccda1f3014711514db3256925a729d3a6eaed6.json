He announced he had begun another round of chemotherapy in September.\n\nMr. Trebek said he regrets making his battle with cancer so public because others in similar situations have turned to him for help and inspiration.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m strong enough or intelligent enough to help alleviate some of that despair, so it\u2019s tough on me,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite this, Mr. Trebek said he isn\u2019t afraid of dying.\n\n\u201cThe thought of the pancreatic cancer does not frighten me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m 79 years old. So, hey, I\u2019ve lived a good life, a full life, and I\u2019m nearing the end of that life. I know that.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
