(AP) \u2014 Visiting a black church bombed by the Ku Klux Klan during the civil rights era, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Sunday framed current racial tensions as part of an enduring struggle that is older than the nation.\n\n\u201cIn a centuries-long campaign of violence, fear, trauma, brought upon black people in this country, the domestic terrorism of white supremacy has been the antagonist of our highest ideals since before the founding of this country,\u201d Biden told the 16th Street Baptist Church congregation in downtown Birmingham as they commemorated the 56th anniversary of the bombing that killed four black girls in 1963.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the wake of these before-and-after moments,\u201d Biden added, \u201cwhen the choice between good and evil is starkest.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s appearance comes at an inflection point for Democrats\u2019 2020 leader in the polls. He is trying to capitalize on his strength among older black voters while navigating criticism from some African American and other nonwhite leaders, particularly younger ones, who take a skeptical view of the 76-year-old white man\u2019s willingness and ability to address systemic racism.\n\nDuring his 20 minutes at the pulpit, Biden condemned institutional racism as the direct legacy of slavery and lamented that the nation has \u201cnever lived up to\u201d the ideals of equality written into its founding documents. But then he added a more personal note \u2014 perhaps the closest he would come to addressing his detractors. \u201cThose who are white try,\u201d Biden said, \u201cbut we can never fully understand.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president called out the names of the bombing victims \u2014 Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson and Cynthia Wesley \u2014 and he drew nods of affirmation as he warned that \u201cthe same poisonous ideology that lit the fuse on 16th Street\u201d has yielded more recent tragedies, including in 2015 at a black church in South Carolina, in 2018 at a Jewish synagogue in Pittsburgh and in August at an El Paso, Texas, Wal-Mart frequented by Latino immigrants.\n\nThe Birmingham church, Biden said, offers an example to those communities and a nation he said must recommit itself to \u201cgiving hate no safe harbor \u2014 demonizing no one, not the poor, the powerless, the immigrant or the \u2018other.\u2019 \u201c\n\nFrom his long time in government, first as a senator and then vice president to Barack Obama, the first black president, Biden has deep ties in the black community. Though Biden didn\u2019t mention President Donald Trump in his remarks, he has made withering critiques of the president\u2019s rhetoric and policies on race and immigration a central feature of his candidacy.\n\nYet Biden sometimes draws searing appraisals from younger nonwhite activists who point to complexities in his record. That includes his references to working productively alongside segregationist senators in the 1970s to distrust over his lead role in a 1994 crime law that critics frame as partially responsible for mass incarceration, especially black men.\n\nThe dynamics flared up again Thursday after Biden, during a Democratic debate, offered a sometimes incoherent answer when asked how the nation should confront the legacy of slavery. At one point, Biden suggested nonwhite parents use a play a record player to help their children with verbal and cognitive development. That led to a social media firestorm and commentary that Biden takes a paternalistic view of black and brown America even as he hammers Trump for emboldening more obvious forms of racism.\n\nAuthor Anand Giridharadas called Biden\u2019s answer \u201cappalling \u2014 and disqualifying\u201d for \u201cimplying that black parents don\u2019t know how to raise their own children.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s audience Sunday seemed more to reflect his relative popularity with black voters.\n\nParishioners wielded their cellphones when he arrived with Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, a white politician beloved in the church for his role as the lead prosecutor who secured convictions decades after the bombing occurred. The congregation gave Biden a standing ovation when he completed his remarks.\n\nAlvin Lewis, a 67-year-old usher at 16th Street Baptist, said the welcome doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to votes. But as Lewis and other congregants offered their assessment of race relations in the United States under Trump, they tracked almost flawlessly the arguments Biden has used to anchor his campaign.\n\n\u201cRacism has reared its head in a way that\u2019s frightening for those of us who lived through it before,\u201d Lewis said, recalling that he was at home, about \u201c20 blocks from here\u201d when the Klan bomb went off at 10:22 a.m. on Sept. 15, 1963. \u201cNo matter what anyone says, what comes out of the president of the United States\u2019 mouth means more than anything,\u201d Lewis added, saying Trump \u201chas brought out some nastier times in this country\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nAntoinette Plump, a 60-year-old who took in the service alongside lifelong member Doris Coke, 92, said racism \u201cwas on the back burner\u201d until Trump \u201cbrought out all the people who are so angry.\u201d\n\nCoke, who was at the church on that Sunday in 1963, said, \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way.\u201d But she nodded her head as Plump denounced Trump.\n\nNearby sat Fay Gaines, a Birmingham resident who was in elementary school in 1963 \u2014 just a few years younger than the girls who died.\n\nGaines said she\u2019s heard and read criticisms about Biden. Asked whether she\u2019d seen his \u201crecord players\u201d answer in the debate, she laughed and said she did. But he remains on her \u201cshort list\u201d of preferred candidates.\n\n\u201cI think there may just be a generational divide,\u201d she said of the reaction. \u201cPeople who lived through all these struggles maybe can understand how to deal with the current situation a little better.\u201d\n\nThat means, she said, recognizing a politician\u2019s core values.\n\n\u201cI trust Joe Biden,\u201d she said. \u201cHistory matters. His history matters.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Visiting a black church bombed by the Ku Klux Klan during the civil rights era, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Sunday framed current racial tensions as part of an enduring struggle that is older than the nation.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bill Barrow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/Election_2020_Biden_15434.jpg-7bedb_c0-0-5075-2958_s1770x1032.jpg?44f56a859a27bd9eadb3ceff0562f37fb1d248e8", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
