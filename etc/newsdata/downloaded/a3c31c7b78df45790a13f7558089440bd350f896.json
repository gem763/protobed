We're working hard every single day.\"\n\nOn the final few days before Monday's vote, volunteers at McCaffrey's campaign office, on the first floor of a high-tech office building in north Kanata, were organizing party literature and calling supporters.\n\nAccording to Johnson, McCaffrey, a bridal gown designer, and her volunteers have knocked on more than 100,000 doors in the riding.\n\n\"We really hear people saying that they're getting by, but they're not getting ahead,\" said Johnson. \"The tax credits for transit ... it's really resonating with people in this area both in Kanata and in the rural parts of the riding.\"\n\nMark Johnson is the campaign manager for Justina McCaffrey, the Conservative candidate in Kanata\u2013Carleton. (Julie Ireton/CBC)\n\nTech workers, farmers, cottagers\n\nThis will only be the second election for this newly formed riding. As Kanata and the surrounding area has developed, the riding has changed boundaries and names.\n\nBefore McCrimmon won the riding for the Liberals in 2015, it was primarily known as Carleton\u2013Mississippi Mills and was represented by former Conservative cabinet minister Gordon O'Connor.\n\nIt now includes the city's tech hub, sprawling suburbs, farmland and cottage communities along the Ottawa River. The distinct needs of these diverse communities means Monday's outcome isn't a foregone conclusion.\n\nThat's why, at McCrimmon's office on Hazeldean Road, volunteers were busy Friday preparing for a full weekend of canvassing.\n\n\"I like helping out and I really believe in what Karen stands for,\" said volunteer Naomi Nakamura between phone calls. \"Just seeing her with her mud boots on, helping at the flood areas and representing us, I think she's the best candidate out there.\"\n\nNaomi Nakamura is a volunteer for the Liberal campaign in Kanata-Carleton. (Julie Ireton/CBC)\n\nGreens, NDP also out campaigning\n\nLast time around, the former Canadian Forces member's opponents were all men. Now, they're almost all women.\n\nLike McCrimmon, the Green Party candidate, Dr. Jennifer Purdy, is retired from the Canadian military. Purdy now runs a small medical practice in Kanata.\n\nAmong the big issues her volunteers have heard at the door are environmental concerns and the protection of pension plans.\n\nThe NDP candidate, Melissa Coenraad, works in a microbiology lab and her team counts affordability, climate change and pharmacare as the primary issues in Kanata\u2013Carleton.\n\nScott Miller, the People's Party candidate, will also be on the ballot.", "description": "On the last weekend before the federal election, hundreds of volunteers around the rural-suburban riding will be knocking on doors, handing out literature and repeating party promises in an attempt to get out the vote Monday.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter", "Julie Ireton Is A Senior Reporter Who Works On Investigations", "Enterprise News Features At Cbc Ottawa.
