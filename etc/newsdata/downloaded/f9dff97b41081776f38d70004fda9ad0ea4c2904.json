The research crunched the numbers of businesses over the course of 2013 to 2018.\n\nDespite all the hurdles that small businesses face, over two-thirds were actually profitable, the data found. However, roughly a third of small businesses were unprofitable and 47% had two weeks or less of cash liquidity.\n\nChris Wheat, the study\u2019s author and the institute\u2019s director of research, told Yahoo Finance that it was surprising that so many small businesses had managed to achieve profitability \u2014 especially with \u201crelatively small\u201d cash buffers. What\u2019s more, he said, liquidity figures are \u201cconsistently low.\u201d\n\n\u201cHolding low levels of cash or having uncertain cash flows can be correlated with exit or low revenue growth,\u201d Wheat explained.\n\nPeople are shown inside the West Harlem Deli, Sunday, Oct. 28, 2018, in New York.

In contrast, only 35% of white communities had establishments with such limited cash.\n\nWheat said the reasons why aren\u2019t clear. However, he underscored minority business owners have the same \u201cexit\u201d rates as those in white neighborhoods, meaning they close at the same frequency as small businesses with fewer financial challenges.\n\nThe analyst pointed out that female-owned small businesses also have similar struggles with cash and growth, \u201cbut their exit rates were similar with men. We don\u2019t have a full explanation to how they\u2019re doing it.\u201d\n\nThe issue is important, given the growing fears of a slowdown, and recent figures that suggest small business optimism is waning. Given the importance of independent businesses for the local economy, the struggles of minority establishments could have far-reaching effects.\n\n\u201cA lot of small businesses hire locally,\u201d Wheat explained. And small businesses also spend locally, which contributes to local economies. But how to improve the financial health of small businesses that might be struggling?\n\nWheat told Yahoo Finance that there are a few initiatives and policies that could be helpful, such as financial literacy education and targeted programs that aim to provide capital to businesses located in majority black and Hispanic communities.\n\nDespite the lower profitability of these small businesses, they have made gains alongside an economy that has been expanding for just over a decade.\n\n\u201cLooking across the time period, we saw profit margin tick up and cash buffers also tick up,\u201d Wheat said. This was applicable across the board, though Wheat said there was consistency among the communities.\n\n\u201cThe communities that had relatively low profits stayed relatively low, and the communities that had relatively high profits stayed relatively high,\u201d he added.\n\nKristin Myers is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
