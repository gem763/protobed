It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.\n\nThe tech sector endured some pretty tough times last year. Even Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) struggled.\n\nBut if we put these troubles aside for a moment and focus on the longer-term outlook, a different picture emerges. Stretching out to 2025, some of these big-name tech stocks begin to look very attractive indeed \u2014 especially at their current price levels.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn order to pinpoint which tech stocks will be leading the way seven years from now, I turned to a recent report from RBC Capital. Its \u201cImagine 2025\u201d portfolio selects the tech stocks the firm believes will be winning on a long-term basis. \u201cWe believe the following names are best positioned to outperform over a seven-year time horizon through 2025,\u201d writes the firm.\n\nWhat does this mean for now? It means longer-term investors should think twice before selling the stocks listed below, while other investors may want to keep a close eye on the following stocks as potential buy on the dip opportunities.\n\nHere are the top tech stocks primed to outperform over the next few years:\n\n\n\n\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)\n\n10 Tech Stocks to Buy Now for 2025 More\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAs I said above, Alphabet has not been immune to the market\u2019s choppiness but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s still not one of the top stocks to buy.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is still a killer stock pick with a \u201cstrong buy\u201d analyst consensus on TipRanks. This is with a $1,346 average analyst price target.\n\n\u201cAMZN and GOOGL, in particular, appear to have invested the most in AI competencies and have the Big Data access and Compute Power infrastructure to benefit most from AI and ML developments,\u201d writes RBC Capital.\n\nAnd Google has an extra string on its bow: its self-driving car unit Waymo. Alphabet disclosed that Waymo reached the 10 million miles of autonomous vehicle driving milestone.\n\n\u201cGOOGL appears particularly well situated to lead autonomous vehicle innovations, given its substantial investments in Waymo autonomous vehicle technology,\u201d it said.\n\nLuckily for Alphabet, RBC believes autonomous vehicles will be arguably one of the biggest applications of AI.\n\nInterested in GOOGL stock?

He tells investors to \u201cbuy the confession.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile there are no guarantees of a winner in the AI race, we think Nvidia is well ahead of its peers and is continuing to gain traction due primarily to the value of Cuda software,\u201d says RBC Capital. It estimates over one million engineers working with Cuda and calls it \u201cthe secret sauce that underlies the entire ecosystem.\u201d Get the NVDA Stock Research Report.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\n10 Tech Stocks to Buy Now for 2025 More", "description": "Editor's note: \"10 Tech Stocks to Buy Now for 2025\" was previously published in September 2019.
