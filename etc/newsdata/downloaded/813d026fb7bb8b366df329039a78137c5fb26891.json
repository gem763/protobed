At least four of these students reportedly resorted to living out of the school's locker room and one said he ended up homeless.\n\nThose allegations and the school's ensuing investigation into the coach were first reported by the Roundup, which publicized student complaints levied against the school. Roundup reporters spoke to Pierce football players who described a scene of bunk beds stacked to the ceilings and cots jammed into any leftover space available. Each of the 30 players in the room paid Woods between $300 and $400 in rent, they said.\n\nThose living conditions were a far cry from what players had been promised. Jose Cordova, a former Pierce football player who left the school following the incidents, told the Roundup that Woods had recruited him from out of state and told him there would be \"four to five\" players sharing a three-bedroom apartment.\n\nWhen he arrived, he said the actual number of roommates was five times that. Cordova described the living quarters as resembling a \"camp\" or \"jail.\"\n\n\"A lot of us were out-of-state kids, stressing every day if the water or power was going to get cut off or if our items would be outside the house because of the eviction,\" Cordova told the Roundup. \"The most stressful time I ever had.\"\n\nNeither Pierce College nor Woods immediately responded to Insider's request for comment about the allegations.\n\nStudent-athletes say they were evicted from the apartment and forced to fend for themselves\n\nThough Woods was reeling in payments from students, that money wasn't going towards paying the apartment, players told the Roundup. Players said they saw notices warning of eviction pile up at the apartment entrance.\n\nUnsure of whether basic bills would be paid, some of the students left. Those who remained were eventually evicted and left to fend for themselves, the students said.\n\nRead more: A 4-year-old was so upset at Florida State's football coach that he decided to sell lemonade for $20 a cup so he could buy out the rest of his contract\n\nWoods gave four of those students permission to live in the school's locker room, according to the Roundup. Several players, including Cordova, complained to the administration and triggered the investigation, Genice Sarcedo-Magruder, the acting athletic director, told the Roundup.\n\n\"He truly crossed the line when I was figuring out housing, living in my car and couldn't show up to the first mandatory practices \u2026 and was kicked off the team,\" Cordova told the Roundup.\n\nPierce College launches an investigation and places coach on temporary leave\n\nPiece College announced its internal investigation into the matter on Thursday, following the Roundup's report.\n\n\"The health and safety of our students is a primary concern of the College, our Chancellor and the Board of Trustees,\" the school's president, Alexis Montevirgen, told the Roundup \"Any allegations concerning employee misconduct or issues involving student safety are taken very seriously and will be thoroughly reviewed.\"\n\nSeveral hours later, the school announced it had placed Woods on temporary administrative leave.\n\nThis is not the first time Woods has run into trouble with a coaching position. In 2017, he was fired from an assistant coaching position at Gavilan College after an investigation found that he and another assistant coach violated recruiting rules, according to San Benito magazine.", "description": "The student-athletes say they were evicted after Woods allegedly failed to pay off the apartment where they were staying and paying him rent.", "authors": ["Mack Degeurin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da0f13fe94e86483429bbca?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
