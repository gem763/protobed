Take our quiz and see if you can recognise some of the biggest stories of 2017.\n\nDuring the first 10 days of the challenge, from December 22 to December 31, 2017, AJ Labs received more than 10,000 completed survey responses.\n\nIn 2018, AJLabs built upon responses from the previous year to create an updated quiz in which thousands of Al Jazeera readers also participated.\n\nMohammed Haddad, head of AJLabs, and Alaa Batayneh, senior strategist of audience development, created the interactives as a 360-video experience that rewards viewers with stamps in a virtual passport for their knowledge of the big news stories of the year.\n\nIn order to receive their final tally of stamps for correct answers, participants were then asked to complete a short emoji-themed news quiz reflecting Al Jazeera readers' news preferences and usage patterns.\n\n\"The resulting audience data helps us prioritise our audience needs and paints a better picture of who we\u2019re writing for when commissioning and producing our stories,\" Haddad said.\n\n\"By leveraging gamification and incorporating social media share ability, this strategy is a way of engaging our loyal readers while helping us understand how to grow new audiences,\" he added.\n\nThe Digiday Publishing Awards recognise companies that are modernising digital media. This year's entrants \"reflect a changing industry \u2026 intent on navigating a path forward,\" wrote the awards' organisers.\n\nCarlos van Meek, Al Jazeera's director of digital innovation and programming, underscored the growing importance of data in online reporting and audience engagement.\n\n\"We\u2019re very proud of the work that Mohammed Haddad and his team are producing. AJLabs is now emerging as one of the most innovative units in the data journalism space,\" he said.\n\n\"Strong editorial combined with the clever use of data helps us better understand our audiences, and vice versa. This award is further proof of data journalism's growing and vital role in newsgathering and story-telling.\"\n\nOver the years, the awards have honoured leading work from brands, agencies, publishers and tech providers such as The Players' Tribune, Dotdash, NBC News and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nOther winners in this year\u2019s competition included CNN, Vox and National Geographic.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://network.aljazeera.com/sites/aj_corporate/files/digiday.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
