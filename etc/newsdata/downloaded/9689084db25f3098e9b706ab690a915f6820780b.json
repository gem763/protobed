Don\u2019t apply minimum wages and all the other red tape measures that now apply.\n\nWithout the red tape hanging over them, we could talk to employers and agree between ourselves about the pay, conditions and other matters.\n\nThat way we will find jobs.\n\nThe labour laws create minimum benefits and make employers give their workers all sorts of benefits that small employers cannot afford.\n\nThe policies are supposed to make employed people more secure in their jobs.\n\nWhat they actually do is make many people less secure and cause small employers, and households especially, to avoid employing people.\n\nThe new [Cyril] Ramaphosa administration has announced that the labour department is to be known as the \u201cdepartment of labour and employment\u201d. No mention is made of unemployment!\n\nIs there any chance that one of its responsibilities will be to change the labour environment to make space for the unemployed?\n\nSadly, the Langeberg Unemployed Forum knows that the answer to that question is \u201cno\u201d.\n\nThe department will continue to see its duty to be to improve conditions for those who already have jobs.\n\nThe unemployed will remain the forgotten people of South Africa until we, the unemployed, demand that our constitutional rights are respected.\n\nOur Constitution is often described as one of the best in the world. So why do the government and state organisations ignore it? Read the Constitution (Section 184) and note that the South African Human Rights Commission has a duty to \u201cpromote respect for human rights and a culture of human rights\u201d and to \u201cinvestigate and to report on the observance of human rights\u201d and \u201cto take steps to secure appropriate redress where human rights have been violated\u201d.\n\nAccording to the latest figures from Statistics South Africa, 9.994 million people were unemployed by the end of March, including 15 000 domestic workers who became unemployed during the first three months of the year.\n\nWe believe many of the extra people who have lost their jobs were retrenched because of the national minimum wage.\n\nYou can\u2019t expect someone who runs a small shop in Robertson to increase wages, perhaps by 50% or even more, and stay open.\n\nPeople who employ workers are their friends, not their enemies. Legislation such as the minimum wage turns them against each other.\n\nOur organisation has realised that if we do nothing the rights of the unemployed will continue to be disrespected.\n\nThe logical organisation that should assist the unemployed is the human rights commission.\n\nWe think that, according to the Constitution, the commission should already have researched the question of the huge unemployment problem in the country.\n\nBut we don\u2019t see any sign of such an investigation.\n\nBecause of our concerns, on March 26 the Langeberg Unemployed Forum held a press conference in Cape Town to tell the media that the 40 members of the forum would proceed to the offices of the human rights commission to lodge a complaint that the labour laws and regulations adopted by Parliament are responsible for a large share of the country\u2019s mass unemployment.\n\nWe are still waiting for a response.\n\nWe call for better treatment of the unemployed. Our goal is to make it easier for the millions of unemployed people to access jobs.\n\nThe high unemployment rate in South Africa is caused by government policies.\n\nThe government might not mean to stop 10 million people from getting jobs, but that is what has happened.\n\nThe legislation and regulations are barriers between employers and people looking for jobs.\n\nThe government and the human rights commission, if they give us a hearing, will ask what we want them to do about the problem.\n\nThe answer is simple \u2013 take away the red tape burden on the people who want to give us jobs and let us make agreements with each other about conditions we both find acceptable.\n\nThe usual story is that if the government does not protect us, we will be treated badly, paid badly, or made to work long hours.\n\nBut is this worse than having no job? No money? Getting no work experience?\n\nAnd having the members of our community and our families look down on us because we are unemployed?\n\nOur members will say to you that we are not children; we are not stupid.\n\nWe want our freedom to choose for ourselves who to work for, at what pay and everything else to do with an employment contract.\n\nLeave us alone and we will look after ourselves. That is our constitutional right.\n\nXolile Mpini, Vuyo Mruba and Denki Selani are members of the Langeberg Unemployed Forum.\n\nFor more information contact Xolile on 073 279 8189", "description": "Dear government, give us back the rights that labour laws have taken away from us.
