Your unprecedented actions have left the President with no choice,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cIn order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his Administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe letter is addressed to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) and House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.). Those three committees are in charge of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe White House\u2019s refusal is almost sure to wind up in court.\n\n\u201cThe White House says there is nothing wrong with pressuring a foreign government to intervene in a US election,\u201d Schiff tweeted in response to the letter, which also attacked the congressman\u2019s character. \u201cThey say: they will not cooperate with an impeachment inquiry unless it\u2019s on their terms. They mean: the President is above the law. The Constitution says otherwise.\u201d\n\nThe White House says there is nothing wrong with pressuring a foreign government to intervene in a US election.\n\n\n\nThey say: they will not cooperate with an impeachment inquiry unless it\u2019s on their terms.\n\n\n\nThey mean: the President is above the law.\n\n\n\nThe Constitution says otherwise. https://t.co/fstH1bGT4Y \u2014 Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) October 8, 2019\n\nThe letter is the latest uptick in the political battle over Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A reconstruction of the call released by the White House shows Trump repeatedly pressuring his counterpart to investigate one of his main political rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden. The call took place shortly after Trump ordered his aides to block military funding to the country, as detailed in a complaint filed by a whistleblower from the intelligence community.\n\nThe call prompted Pelosi to finally launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s behavior, although the president has vehemently denied any wrongdoing and moved to delegitimize the effort.\n\nJust after the White House released the letter Tuesday, the House announced that it had subpoenaed Gordon Sondland, the U.S. European Union ambassador, for both documents and a deposition. Trump blocked Sondland earlier that day from testifying to lawmakers about the president\u2019s communications with Ukraine.\n\nLast Thursday, the chairs of three committees released text messages they obtained from Kurt Volker, who was until last month the U.S. State Department\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine. The missives appear to show clear instances of the Trump administration pressuring Ukraine for political favors.\n\nAxios reported that the White House wants congressional Democrats, particularly those holding vulnerable seats, to go on the record in support of impeachment. Republicans will reportedly also have more sway over the inquiry once it is formalized.\n\nPelosi\u2019s office has so far resisted those calls. On Oct. 3, she wrote a letter to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) reiterating that House committees had the \u201cfull authority to conduct investigations for all matters under their jurisdiction, including impeachment investigations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no requirement under the Constitution, under House Rules, or House precedent that the whole House vote before proceeding with an impeachment inquiry,\u201d Pelosi wrote. \u201cWe hope you and other Republicans share our commitment to following the facts, upholding the Constitution, protecting our national security, and defending the integrity of our elections at such a serious moment in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have thus far stood by Trump and moved to minimize the fallout from the call. GOP lawmakers who have fallen out of lockstep have been immediately castigated by their party.\n\nRead the letter below:\n\nThis article has been updated with a response from Rep. Adam Schiff and the House subpoena being sent to a former ambassador.", "description": "An eight-page letter to House leaders, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said that the White House will not cooperate with the inquiry into President Trump...", "authors": ["Reporter", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9d008e2000003a064fa8df.jpeg?cache=3jpsv6d9lg&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
