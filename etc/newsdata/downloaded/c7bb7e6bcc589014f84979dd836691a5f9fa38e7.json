When firefighters arrived, they found more than a dozen horses dead inside.\n\nThe owner of the stable, Blake Carney, was out of town at a horse show at the time, he told WAGA-TV . But a caretaker who was in an apartment inside the barn made it out with a dog and one pony, Bartow County Battalion Chief Darrell Abernathy told news outlets.\n\nCarney called the fire \"every horse person's worst nightmare.\" He said he buried the horses Monday. Carney also said he lost many of his own belongings in the fire.\n\nInvestigators think the fire started near chips used for the horses' bedding, a Bartow County Fire Battalion Chief said. Fire Marshall Gary Garland said he believes the fire was accidental.\n\nWind that night caused the fire to spread rapidly through the wood structure, Garland added. Losses could be up to $3 million for the animals and 10,000-square-foot (929-square-meter) barn, Sandy Turner, another Battalion Chief, told a local outlet .", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
