But economically, the oil-producing province contributes 17% to the country's GDP.\n\nThen there are the equalisation payments, the money that \"have not\" provinces receive from the federal government. Alberta contributes billions a year to the federal tax pool because of its strong economy, but has not received a payment since 1965.\n\nThat remained true even when Alberta was hit with its worst financial crisis in decades.\n\nBetween 2014-16, an overabundance of supply caused the worldwide price of oil to plummet, which led to the loss of more than 100,000 jobs in the province and a full-on recession.\n\nAlberta's economic recession GDP growth in Alberta vs Canada\n\nSince then, the economic recovery has been fragile, especially as several pipeline projects hang in limbo.\n\nThat has left many Albertans feeling anxious and ignored, says Peter Downing, a right-wing political muckraker.\n\n\"We've always been okay to help other parts of the country when they've been in need,\" he says.\n\n\"But when we've been in need, we've been nothing but kicked all the way around.\"\n\nEnter Wexit\n\nMr Downing is hoping to spin this feeling of economic betrayal into a viable political movement, with the creation of Wexit Alberta.\n\nThe group is campaigning for the western province to separate from Canada and form its own nation (possibly alongside another western province). It's an old idea that has gained momentum as relations between Alberta and the rest of the country have deteriorated.\n\nSeparatist candidates have run in Albertan elections since the 1930s, but have never won power, unlike separatist politicians in Quebec.\n\nIn the 2019 provincial election, the Alberta Independence Party received about 13,400 votes, or less than 1% of the popular vote. While those results may not signify an impending political reckoning, there are signs it is growing, according to a recent Environics Institute survey.\n\nIn Alberta, 56% of respondents agreed with the statement, \"Western Canada gets so few benefits from being part of Canada that they might as well go it on their own,\" up 28 points from 2010.\n\nAlthough separatists can be from any end of the political spectrum, in libertarian Alberta, they tend to be on the right.\n\nThis partly stems from the movement's revival in the 1980s, when Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau implemented the deeply unpopular National Energy Programme, which centralised control of Albertan oil with the federal government.\n\nGetty What Albertans think of Trudeau 12% think Justin Trudeau should be the next prime minister\n\n83%want his Liberal Party out of government Ipsos poll, 01/10/2019\n\nNow, this antipathy has shifted towards his son, current PM Justin Trudeau, who is up for re-election on 21 October.\n\nThe Liberal leader is deeply unpopular in the province, in part because of his father, but also because of his environmentalism.\n\nThe Conservative Party, led by Andrew Scheer, is expected to sweep the province.\n\nEarth v economy\n\nClimate change is one of the top concerns across the country this election, and Mr Trudeau - who once said he'd like to \"phase out\" Alberta's oil sands - has promised to bring Canada to zero emissions by 2050.\n\nAnd that has put a bullseye on Alberta's oil sands, which contribute about 11% of Canada's total greenhouse-gas emissions.\n\nTwo provinces - British Columbia and Quebec - have already gone to court to stop industry from building pipelines through their territory.\n\nIn the mouths of climate activists, the oil sands sound like a \"dirty word\", says Martha Hall Findlay, CEO of the Canada West Foundation, a non-partisan think tank.\n\nBut in Alberta, she says, they are the lifeline of the economy, and responsible for much of the country's prosperity as a whole.\n\n\"It's not as though people here are less passionate about climate change, but there's so much misinformation about the energy industry that it's become really polarised,\" she says.\n\nGetty Alberta's oil industry By the numbers 2.91 million barrels per day\n\n82 kg greenhouse gas emissions per barrell\n\n$38.84per barrell of West Canadian Crude (03/10/19) Source: Natural Resources Canada\n\nThese legal battles with other provinces have caused significant project delays, which helped deflate the price of oil just as it was recovering from its slump in late 2018.\n\nThat decline had ripple effects throughout Alberta's economy, says University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombs.\n\n\"The recovery, while it was robust in 2017, simply stalled completely in 2018 and we've kind of been flat for the last year and a half,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright The Washington Post via Getty Images Image caption Alberta's Sycrude oils fields\n\nMany Albertans blame Mr Trudeau's policies for this turn of events, and Mr Cooper, the Albertan political scientist who is also a separatist, says he is certain that if Mr Trudeau is re-elected, Albertan separation will soon follow.\n\n\"I think it's inevitable,\" he says.\n\nThese feelings have gone so far mainstream that Conservative Premier Jason Kenney even admitted to sympathising with separatists, although he said he'd \"rather focus on separating him from the Prime Minister's office\".\n\nBut Mr Trudeau has also angered climate activists when he bought the Trans Mountain Pipeline in 2018 to the tune of C$4.5bn ($3.4bn, \u00a32.7bn). The project had been indefinitely suspended by Kinder Morgan due to legal battles, and Mr Trudeau said buying it was the only way to ensure it would be built, and that Alberta and Canada's economy would stay on track.\n\nWhile that may seem like a win for Alberta, Ms Findlay says it is a symbol of the current government's failure to protect Alberta's interests.\n\n\"No one wanted the federal government to buy a pipeline,\" she says.\n\n\"We would much rather have an environment where the private sector could actually get a project like that built.\"", "description": "As talk about climate change in Canada heats up, so has Alberta's separatist movement.", "authors": ["Robin Levinson-King", "Bbc News", "Calgary"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/139F1/production/_109096308_gettyimages-1125875707.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
