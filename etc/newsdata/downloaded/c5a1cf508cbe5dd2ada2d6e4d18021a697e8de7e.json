About Two-Thirds of the Way, Americans Say", "language": "en", "text": "Protesters prepare for the civil war. Photo: Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images\n\nA majority of Americans, no matter where they live, or the party they typically vote for, think the country is growing apart. On political, racial, and class lines, Americans think divisions are widening, according to a new Georgetown University poll.\n\nThat division is leading to a dark place, respondents said. Asked how close the country is to the \u201cedge of a civil war\u201d \u2014 with 0 being not close at all and 100 being time to get the \u201cgo\u201d bag \u2014 Americans say we\u2019re at 67.23. So, two-thirds of the way to internecine bloodshed. Could be better. Could be worse.\n\nThe poll also shows how people think we got here. On one side are Republicans who say Democratic political leaders and the media are responsible for the division. On the other side are Democrats who say Trump, his Republican allies, and \u201cwealthy special interests\u201d are to blame. The only thing the two sides can agree on is that we\u2019re screwed.\n\nAdd political leaders and prominent pundits invoking civil war to that environment, and you get a country that feels like it\u2019s nearing collapse. Those invocations are coming more and more from the right, Charlie Wetzel wrote in the New York Times last month. Here\u2019s why:\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that we\u2019re not on the brink of a civil war; the threat as outlined by right-wing media is intended to inspire fear in liberals and conservatives alike. For conservatives, it\u2019s the notion that Democrats will stop at nothing to get rid of Mr. Trump and will marshal the forces of the \u201cdeep state\u201d to right the wrongs of the 2016 election. For liberals, it is a warning: Don\u2019t push churchgoing, gun-loving conservatives too far, or there\u2019ll be dangerous consequences.\n\nIt\u2019s not just pro-Trump forces either. It\u2019s Trump himself. In late September, Trump tweeted a quote from a pastor warning that if he\u2019s removed from office it will cause \u201ca Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.\u201d\n\nOften, civil-war warnings from right wingers come during discussions over guns. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s pledge to \u201ctake\u201d guns at last month\u2019s Democratic debate accelerated the threats, whipping up passion among guns-rights advocates such as Rob Drake, a Major League Baseball umpire. This week, Drake tweeted a message that could have come out of any right-wing fever swamp: \u201cI will be buying an AR-15 tomorrow, because if you impeach MY PRESIDENT this way, YOU WILL HAVE ANOTHER CIVAL WAR!!! #MAGA2020.\u201d The tweet was eventually deleted, and not because of the typo.", "description": "A poll from Georgetown shows that Americans think the country is 67 percent of the way to a new civil war.", "authors": ["Adam K.
