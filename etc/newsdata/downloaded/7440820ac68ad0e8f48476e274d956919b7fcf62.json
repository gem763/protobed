But I just keep moving on, keep trundling on, keep swimming upstream.\u2019\n\nShirley was \u2018insecure\u2019 next to Darcey Bussell (Picture: WireImage)\n\nShirley previously underwent breast enlargement surgery back in 2002, in a bid to save her marriage to ex-husband Corky Ballas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe had her breast size increased from a 32B to a 34DD when she realised he had been unfaithful, as she felt she needed to make herself \u2018more attractive\u2019.\n\n\u2018He said the affairs were just about sex,\u2019 she added to the publication. \u2018\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with you. I love you,\u201d he told me. But I never got a grip around that. That\u2019s when I got these [implants].\n\n\u2018I thought I\u2019d have this fantastic bust and everyone would look at me and think I was amazing.\n\nShirley underwent a breast enlargement in 2002 (Picture: PA)\n\nHowever, the dancer became more appreciative of her more natural, smaller bust since she started dating actor Danny Taylor, and became \u2018at peace\u2019 with herself.\n\nShirley is set to get the implants removed at the end of the month, after a doctor revealed it may not be possible to check for cancer behind them.\n\nAnd she has no plans to get new implants put it.\n\n\u2018There are rumours that scar tissues cause chronic fatigue which I have suffered with even over the last year,\u2019 she previously said to The Sun.\n\n\u2018But if they take out the scar tissue it would involve bigger surgery and perhaps a reconstruction. But I don\u2019t want any implants in. I don\u2019t want any foreign bodies in my body.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStrictly Come Dancing continues on Sunday, at 7.15pm, on BBC.\n\nNeed support?
