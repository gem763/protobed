The incident escalated quickly, and the receiver was held back by teammates.\n\nA suspension could've led to the end of his time in Oakland as the team would've been able to void his $30.125 million worth of guarantees, per Schefter. However, it appears all sides are willing to move past the situation and return to football.\n\nIt's the latest of numerous off-field problems for Brown since he joined the Raiders. He missed time with a foot injury caused by misuse of a cryotherapy machine, while an extended grievance against the NFL regarding a helmet issue led to more missed practices.\n\nIt appears his talent has given him a lot of leeway. He's earned seven Pro Bowl nominations and four first-team All-Pro selections over the last eight years.", "description": "Oakland Raiders  head coach  Jon Gruden  announced Friday receiver  Antonio Brown  is back with the team and the \"plan\" is for him to play Monday night against the  Denver Broncos ...", "authors": ["Rob Goldberg"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/826/886/hi-res-9cc30d6fd5cb349c4a975ae4b9ff4596_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
