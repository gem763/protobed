And what am I doing? Biggest hypocrite in the world.\n\n\"I smacked him - not hard, didn't leave a mark - but the fear in his eyes and the relationship changed and there was an effect... he started hitting more.\"\n\nHowever Clare said: \"I think there's a very fine line between the state interfering with parental responsibility.\"\n\nShe added that she felt as though it was \"big brother honing in\".\n\nUnsurprisingly, this sparked a huge debate online with opposing viewpoints.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nOne tweeted: \"Once again we are becoming more of a nanny state. 99% + are responsible parents who risk being prosecuted for discipling their children. You feeling guilty is not a reason to stop the rest of us parenting the way we feel is proportionate #nannystate #ThisMorning.\"\n\nAnother agreed, commenting: \"#ThisMorning @ITV I'm 20 year old and our parents lightly smacked us if we were misbehaving but it hasn't made me hostile or disrespectful to adults. Also out family is really close.\"\n\nHowever a third remarked: \"We can discipline a child without smacking them. How can anyone advocate resorting to violence to communicate with a child?! 'It never did me any harm'?!? People have no idea how experiencing smacking as a child, unconsciously affects them as an adult #thismorning.\"\n\nAnother wrote: \"#thismorning I agree no smacking is best but not sure how this law will be enforced. Surely they\u2019re not expecting social workers to go out to every smacked child? If so they\u2019ll need to pull in more resources as priority will be children at significant risk of harm.\"\n\nWhile one fumed: \"#ThisMorning Ban smacking, what\u2019s next? Being punished onto a \u201c naughty step, taking toys away or not going to a fun event\u201d will be mental abuse...\"\n\n*This Morning airs weekdays at 10.30am on ITV", "description": "Broadcaster Rebecca Wilcox appeared on This Morning to debate new Scottish legislation banning smoking", "authors": ["Rose Hill", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20410973.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EH_CHP_041019TM_1326JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
