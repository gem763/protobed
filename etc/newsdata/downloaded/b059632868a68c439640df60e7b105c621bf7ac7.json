(AP) - Jim Harbaugh insists Michigan is hitting its stride on offense, apparently seeing what observers outside the program are missing.\n\nThe Wolverines were held scoreless for the final three quarters of a 10-3 win over then-No. 14 Iowa and appeared to affirm doubts they can have success with the ball against quality opponents.\n\nNo. 16 Michigan (4-1, 2-1) may be able to put together an encouraging performance at Illinois (2-3, 0-1) on Saturday as it did in a 52-0 win over Rutgers last week, but ranked teams are awaiting on the second half of the regular season schedule to provided tougher tests.\n\nThe Wolverines have games coming up at No. 10 Penn State, against No. 9 Notre Dame and No. 3 Ohio State along with matchups against rival Michigan State and at Maryland.\n\nTo reach their goal of winning the Big Ten title for the first time in 15 years, the margin of error is small and that adds a sense of urgency to improve with the ball under first-year offensive coordinator Josh Gattis.\n\nHarbaugh hailed the hiring of Gattis and raved about the no-huddle, spread offense the former Alabama assistant was going to be in charge of without interference. Gattis began calling plays, for the first time, from the press box before moving to the field for the last two games.\n\nWith the coordinator up high and down low, the results have been uneven at best.\n\nBig plays have been few and far between.\n\nShea Patterson threw a 51-yard pass to Nico Collins on the first play of Michigan\u2019s second drive against Iowa. For the rest of the afternoon, a play wasn\u2019t called to throw deep again or Patterson didn\u2019t have time to go long.\n\n\u201cWe just stayed patient and took what they gave us,\u201d Patterson said after the game.\n\nThe running game also was not very effective with freshman Zach Charbonnet leading the way with just 42 yards rushing, barely averaging more than 3 yards per carry.\n\n\u201cThere are still some things we gotta clean up, but they weren\u2019t detrimental,\u201d center Cesar Ruiz said Saturday.\n\nEven though Michigan\u2019s defense forced four turnovers, its offense was able to score just three points on ensuing possessions.\n\n\u201cWe left a lot out there,\u201d Patterson acknowledged.\n\nProblems passing and running have added up to lackluster results.\n\nThe Wolverines rank among the bottom half of teams in the Big Ten in scoring, rushing, passing, sacks allowed, third-down conversions, red zone offense and turnovers.\n\nPatterson had the third-lowest quarterback rating of his career against the Hawkeyes and three of his worst games, statistically, have happened this season. Michigan hasn\u2019t had a running back reach the 50-yard rushing mark in three games. It went into the season touting three receivers - Collins, Donovan Peoples-Jones and Tarik Black - but none of them have consistently clicked with Patterson in an offense that hasn\u2019t lived up to its speed-in-space billing.\n\nThe offensive line has not become a position group to count on even though it has four returning starters, all of whom earned some level of All-Big Ten recognition last season.\n\nHarbaugh has said, repeatedly, it\u2019s all good when his team has the ball.\n\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019re very close offensively and very close to hitting our stride, hitting on all cylinders,\u201d he said. \u201cReally good evidence to back that up and also what I see.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jim Harbaugh insists Michigan is hitting its stride on offense, apparently seeing what observers outside the program are missing.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Larry Lage"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/iowa_michigan_football_93542_c0-165-3938-2461_s1770x1032.jpg?ef9d8574ac8ee38fca3f6353906639493ada4c92", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
