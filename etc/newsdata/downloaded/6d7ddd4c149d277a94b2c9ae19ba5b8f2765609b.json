We\u2019ll continue to improve, innovate, invite more of you in, add more content, and do it with the community in an open and transparent way,' wrote Choudhry.\n\n'We can\u2019t wait to hear your stories and share more at X019!'", "description": "Gamers in the US, UK, and Korea have all been invited by Microsoft to join a beta for xCloud, the company's upcoming streaming platform that will allow users to stream console games anywhere.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/23/19713198-0-image-a-72_1571090901192.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
