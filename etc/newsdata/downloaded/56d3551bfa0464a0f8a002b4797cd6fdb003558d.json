It carries so many important parts of their life around \u2013 from laptops to lunch and therefore needs to be up to the challenge.\n\nYounger children might not have stacks of homework but having their own bag is so important in terms of their development. It encourages them to start taking responsibility for their things and this make them feel grown up, which in turn promotes confidence.\n\nNo matter what the age or stage of a child, the main thing we were looking for in their school bag was comfort. Did the bag feel good to wear? Did the strap/s feel sufficiently strong and sturdy? When filled, was the weight of the bag evenly spread about?\n\nThen of course there were other considerations. Size, for one. What could it fit inside easily without a battle against zips and clips every day? Was it easy to access? Did all the fastenings work cleanly?\n\nWe also took into account helpful things like hidden compartments for pens, water bottle holders and so on.\n\nFinally, we thought hard about how each bag might fare being used every single day. Was it built to last? From reception class newbies to teenagers with packed timetables, here\u2019s our selection.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

We defy anyone to travel in a major city on any given day and not see at least one. But, unlike so many fashionable flights of fancy, the Kanken\u2019s is a steady, assured popularity, which has roots not in its aesthetic (which is non-the-less pleasing) but because it is so comfortable. It was, as the inside label will tell you, launched in 1978 to prevent Swedish schoolchildren from developing back problems. The rear pocket contains a seat pad which stops the contents of the bag digging into the wearer\u2019s back.\n\nSmaller children could opt for the miniature version but we found that our eight-year-old tester was better off with the adult size. We managed to fit a laptop, three hardback books, a pair of trainers and a Tupperware sandwich box inside. It\u2019s beautifully made, robust and cheering. The perfect school bag.\n\nBuy now\n\nFrugi adventurers backpack: \u00a325, Frugi\n\nWith a capacity of 14l and measuring 28 x 34 x 11cm \u2013 this is a roomy bag, capable of holding A4 pads and folders as well as all the other accessories typical of a primary schooler.\n\nYou can also get matching lunch bag, pencil case and water bottles \u2013 the latter can be stored snugly in one of the two stretchy side pockets. We especially liked the reflective patches on the front pockets and along the straps for extra safety on darker evenings when the nights draw in.\n\nOur little tester, who was six, enjoyed exploring the different compartments of the backpack and working out where to store all her stuff and reported that it was a \u201cgrown-ups bag\u201d \u2013 which is high praise indeed. The straps were easily adjustable and with enough padding for comfort.\n\nMade from 100 per cent recycled polyester, this bag is eco-friendly and can be personalised to boot.\n\nBuy now\n\nRex London dolly llama mini backpack: \u00a312.95, Rex London\n\nLlamas are rivalling the unicorn for motif of choice on the clothes and accessories of little ones across the land. Diminutive at 21 x 28 x 10 cm, this backpack is a simple design \u2013 a large primary compartment with a small zip pocket on the front. It is feather-light and boasts a carrying handle and adjustable shoulder straps.\n\nAs predicted, the pattern wowed our four-year-old tester, who made a beeline for the bag. It was easy for her to wear, the straps were wide, if not plump which made any weight accumulated inside the bag easily distributed.\n\nBuy now\n\nPersonalised koala print backpack: \u00a327, My 1st Years\n\nWhile personalising is always special, it\u2019s actually extremely practical when it comes to something like a schoolbag. There is much less scope for misplacement or confusion and your offspring\u2019s teachers will be grateful. This koala print backpack can be personalised with embroidered letters across the front up for names up to nine letters long.\n\nNot only is it really cute to look at, this backpack is brilliantly designed. There are three zipped compartments, including a coin pocket and pencil slots. There are two large sleeves on either side for bottles. It\u2019s pretty big \u2013 43 x 30 x 13cm \u2013 which means it will also work nicely as a weekend away bag or as hand luggage on holidays, and yet it\u2019s still really light.\n\nThis was a hit with two different testers \u2013 one who was six and the other who was eight. The pattern was a major draw, as were all the \u201csecret pockets\u201d.\n\nBuy now\n\nZatchels leather city backpack: \u00a358, Zatchels\n\nHandmade using beautiful leather, this is such a gorgeous bag. It\u2019s so pretty and smart, befitting a grown-up student who wants to dress for success.\n\nThis backpack comes in two sizes, but we recommend the city plus, as it\u2019s the perfect size to easily accommodate laptops and files. The leather straps are detachable, should you just want to carry it like a briefcase or as a shoulder bag. And if baby blue isn\u2019t your most favourite colour, there are plenty of others to choose from.\n\nOur tester, aged 14, loved the grown up look of this bag, but noted that the straps felt hard \u2013 something that goes with the territory when it comes to new leather, but time will soften them into comfort. Plus, it\u2019s in the sale so this is a proper bargain.\n\nBuy now\n\nJojo Maman Bebe fox backpack: \u00a316, Jojo Maman Bebe\n\nAt 26 x 21 x 9cm this small backpack with a friendly fox face \u2013 complete with ears and a tail \u2013 on the front is the perfect first bag for any child. There is room enough for snacks, a fresh set of clothes and even a favoured toy. The straps are not padded, but they are adjustable and strong.\n\nThis was adored by our tester, who is just about to turn four \u2013 the \u201csecret face pocket\u201d was perhaps the standout feature for him, while we noted that the fit was snug and comfortable.\n\nBuy now\n\nHunter original kids backpack: \u00a340, Hunter\n\nA mini version of the adult backpack, this retains all of the benefits and qualities. It is water resistant with strong, substantial zips with big teeth, in the traditional Hunter colours. Measuring 32cm x 10.5cm x 24.5cm and with a capacity of just over 10 litres, this bag can easily accommodate fresh clothes, a pencil case and a few seasonal accoutrements from wellies, gloves and hats to sunscreen and shades.\n\nOur six-year-old tester looked so smart with this on his back. The straps were easy to adjust and abundantly padded so that there was no digging or pressure even when worn over a thin t-shirt. The texture was lovely too \u2013 almost silky to the touch.\n\nThere are other colours to choose from including pink, red, black and even multi-coloured featuring Peppa Pig thanks to a collaboration with everyone\u2019s favourite happy little hog.\n\nBuy now\n\nHerschel retreat backpack: \u00a380, Herschel Supply Co\n\nThis is big (43 x 30.5 x 15cm) and extremely practical for athletic secondary schoolers who need to tote their sports kit about, as well as the usual stack of books and other paraphernalia required by teenagers.\n\nOur 14-year-old tester gave this two massive thumbs up for a number of reasons. Firstly, for the padded laptop sleeve that is integral to the inside of the backpack which can hold a device measuring up to 15 inches.\n\nThe drawstring closure underneath the main cover flap is a really important and appreciated feature mainly in terms of security as children travelling on public transport can be especially vulnerable to pickpockets. On the flipside the hidden magnet fastening allows for easy access while retaining the traditional buckled look. The best part of this big bag is how light it is.\n\nBuy now\n\nNext animal face rucksack: \u00a316, Next\n\nWe were totally charmed by the awesome animal faces print on this backpack, which has a glossy PVC coating \u2013 always handy when it comes to cleaning or protection from light rain.\n\nThis is a simple piece of kit \u2013 no hidden compartment except for a smaller front pocket. Our testers, a handful of girls and boys aged between three and 10 all loved this bag. Measuring 33 x 23 x 13 cm \u2013 there is plenty of space in here for a pencil case, snacks and of course, homework!\n\nBuy now\n\nCambridge Satchel Company classic leather batchel: \u00a3175, Cambridge Satchel Company\n\nThis batchel (a satchel with a handle) the most traditional of scholarly accessories. It might seem silly to describe school bags for children as investment pieces, but this \u2013 which is by far the priciest of our round up \u2013 will last all through secondary school and beyond. The leather is luxurious quality, the craftsmanship beautiful and, if there\u2019s a formal uniform policy you could never get into hot water with this on your shoulder.\n\nWe plumped for the 15-inch version because it could hold a small laptop. It comes in its own cloth bag which is a grown up, sophisticated touch.\n\nOur 13-year-old tester was especially enamoured with the idea that this could be engraved with one\u2019s initials\u2026 This suits smart, organised pupils \u2013 and will last a lifetime if well looked after.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: School bags\n\nThe Kanken by Fjallraven has everything you could possibly ask for in a schoolbag \u2013 and it\u2019s good for growing backs. For younger children the Rex London dolly llama backpack is light, simple, fun \u2013 and inexpensive.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
