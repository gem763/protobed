You fill your stomach up four or five times a day - some do it more - and it gives you a feeling of comfort.\n\n\"It's like having a pair of arms around you, but it's temporarily, temporary. Then you're disgusted at the bloatedness of your stomach, and then you bring it all up again.\n\n\"And it's a repetitive pattern which is very destructive to yourself.\"\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nJust as Meghan spoke about adjusting to life in the spotlight, Diana was asked if she was aware of the \"significance\" of becoming the Princess of Wales.\n\nShe said: \" I wasn't daunted, and am not daunted by the responsibilities that that role creates. It was a challenge, it is a challenge.\n\n\"As for becoming Queen, it's, it was never at the forefront of my mind when I married my husband: it was a long way off that thought.\n\n\"The most daunting aspect was the media attention, because my husband and I, we were told when we got engaged that the media would go quietly, and it didn't; and then when we were married they said it would go quietly and it didn't; and then it started to focus very much on me, and I seemed to be on the front of a newspaper every single day, which is an isolating experience, and the higher the media put you, place you, is the bigger the drop.\n\n\"And I was very aware of that.\n\n\"It took a long time to understand why people were so interested in me, but I assumed it was because my husband had done a lot of wonderful work leading up to our marriage and our relationship.\n\n\"But then I, during the years you see yourself as a good product that sits on a shelf and sells well, and people make a lot of money out of you.\"\n\nShe also spoke about becoming a mum for the first time, admitting she struggled from post-natal depression in the months after welcoming Prince William.\n\n(Image: Tim Graham/Getty Images)\n\nShe said: \"Well, everybody was thrilled to bits. It had been quite a difficult pregnancy - I hadn't been very well throughout it - so by the time William arrived it was a great relief because it was all peaceful again, and I was well for a time.\n\n\"Then I was unwell with post-natal depression, which no one ever discusses, post-natal depression, you have to read about it afterwards, and that in itself was a bit of a difficult time. You'd wake up in the morning feeling you didn't want to get out of bed, you felt misunderstood, and just very, very low in yourself.\n\n\"I never had had a depression in my life.\n\nBut then when I analysed it I could see that the changes I'd made in the last year had all caught up with me, and my body had said: `We want a rest.'\n\n\"I received a great deal of treatment, but I knew in myself that actually what I needed was space and time to adapt to all the different roles that had come my way. I knew I could do it, but I needed people to be patient and give me the space to do it.\"", "description": "Princess Diana gave one of her most famous ever interviews after her seperation from Prince Charles, and she spoke about many of the issues Meghan Markle did in the Harry and Meghan: An African Adventure documentary", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Pa", "Bbc", "Tim Graham Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12949069.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Britains-80-years-of-TV.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
