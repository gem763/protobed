Many of the migrants are still not accounted for, including a number of children.\n\n\u201cThe boat was in no condition to make the crossing,\u201d said Italian magistrate Salvatore Vella, who is investigating the disaster. \u201cIt is strange they put to sea in such bad weather.\u201d\n\nVella said most of the passengers came from Tunisia or sub-Saharan Africa. None of them had life jackets.\n\nThe boat appeared to have started its voyage in Libya and stopped in neighbouring Tunisia, he added, before heading north towards Lampedusa, an Italian island which sits below Sicily and is a magnet for migrants seeking a new life in Europe.\n\n\u201cMost of the survivors ... are only alive thanks to the courage of the men of the coastguard and the police,\u201d he said.\n\nA coastguard and a police boat spotted the listing migrant boat just after midnight about 6 nautical miles from the coast of Lampedusa, having picked up a call for help late on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIn order to proceed with the transfer operation, the naval units approached the small boat, but the adverse weather conditions and the sudden movement of migrants caused the vessel to overturn,\u201d the coastguard said in a statement.\n\nRescue personnel carry a stretcher off a rescue vessel, after a ship carrying some 50 migrants began taking on water off the coast of Lampedusa, Italy October 7, 2019.

Malta has said it will let this group disembark on Tuesday.\n\nThe Italian interior ministry says 7,939 migrants have reached Italy by boat so far this year, down 63% on the same period in 2018 and 93% on 2017 levels.\n\nItaly has introduced tough laws over the past year to dissuade charity rescue ships from operating in the Mediterranean in an effort to cut back on the number of possible asylum-seekers reaching the country.\n\nThe government has also urged both Tunisia and Libya to do more to prevent migrant boats from setting sail.\n\nRescue personnel carry a stretcher off a rescue vessel, after a ship carrying some 50 migrants began taking on water off the coast of Lampedusa, Italy October 7, 2019.

The next largest group, by nationality, were Pakistanis with 997 making the crossing, followed by migrants from the Ivory Coast, who totalled 867.", "description": "Italian coastguards recovered the bodies of 13 women who died after a crowded migrant boat capsized in bad weather as rescue craft approached it off the coast of Lampedusa, local authorities said on Monday.", "authors": ["Wladimiro Pantaleone", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438136455&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960ZC", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
