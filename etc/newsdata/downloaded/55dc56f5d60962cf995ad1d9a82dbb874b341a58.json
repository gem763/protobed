Obviously it\u2019s disappointing [to see people wanting to climb] but compared to the school holidays this [crowd] isn\u2019t too much.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tjiangu Thomas at the base of Uluru.

Uluru\u2019s origins in formation go back half a billion years.\n\nThe first non-Aboriginal person to see the rock was the explorer William Gosse in 1873, who, after traversing \u201cwretched country\u201d saw \u201cone immense rock rising abruptly from the plain\u201d. The rock is higher than the Eiffel Tower and extends several kilometres below the ground.\n\nGosse named it Ayers Rock after Sir Henry Ayers, the chief secretary of South Australia at the time. In 1993 the rock was formally given its traditional name, Uluru.\n\nClimbing of the rock began in the 1930s, taking a spiritually significant route up the steep slope that traced the steps taken by the ancestral Mala men who arrived at Uluru. A chain link handrail was installed in 1966 without consulting traditional owners.\n\nThe number of visitors climbing Uluru has been steadily dropping, from about three-quarters of visitors to the site in the 1990s to just 16.5% in 2015.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The last day of climbing at Uluru.

At least 36 people have died during the climb, and between 2002-09 rangers rescued 74 people, many struck with heat exhaustion and dehydration.\n\nIn 2016, the government resisted persistent pressure to close the climb, but a year ago, a management board meeting of the national park voted unanimously to ban the practice.\n\nThomas said: \u201cIt\u2019s rather emotional, having elders who picked up this long journey before I was born to close the climb. They\u2019re no longer here, but we\u2019re carrying their legacy to close the climb. So there\u2019s a bit of sadness there, but also happiness knowing that the climb will be closed and respect is going to be given to Anangu\u2019s wishes.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of our resources to manage the climb and it does take away from the cultural value of this place.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, there were cheers among the tourists when rangers opened the climb after a morning closure due to high winds. Some boos also accompanied the first climbers.\n\nOn Wednesday and Thursday the climb had been closed intermittently as temperatures went above 36C (96.8F), the threshold for rangers to close the climb.\n\nAt the front of the queue a couple from the South Australian city of Adelaide, who did not want to be named, said the climb was \u201cimportant to them as Australians, because the rock is a symbol for all of us\u201d.\n\nHikaru Ide, from Nagano, Japan, who is on a working holiday in Australia, said he had come to Uluru to pay his respects by not climbing. Ide said Uluru was sacred, and to walk around the base was enough.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hikaru Ide (R) and Masahiro Suda pay their respects to the rock.
