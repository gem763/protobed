After Trump said that he would appeal any impeachment attempt to the Supreme Court, Dershowitz claimed that it was \u201ccertainly possible\u201d that the court would stop the Senate from holding a trial. Former Justice David Souter had, he explained, once written an opinion saying the court might have to step in. What Dershowitz skipped over is that even in this solo concurrence, Souter was talking about such hypotheticals as a Senate conviction based on a coin toss.\n\nDershowitz\u2019s new Wall Street Journal op-ed article is less outlandish. It even gets some key points right. He rebukes those who say that the House can impeach the president on any ground it chooses. A member of the House, he notes, should vote to impeach a federal officer only after concluding that the officer has committed \u201chigh crimes or misdemeanors.\u201d The drafters of the Constitution considered letting Congress remove a president for \u201cmaladministration\u201d but rejected the idea. That decision should strengthen the presumption that the phrase high crimes and misdemeanors should be treated as a meaningful constraint. As Dershowitz concludes, members of Congress should be \u201creasonable and conscientious\u201d in applying the words.\n\nBut he goes badly wrong when he tries to interpret the phrase in a way that immunizes Trump. \u201cAs for the allegations against President Trump, obstruction of justice is plainly a high crime, but a president cannot commit it by exercising his constitutional authority to fire or pardon, regardless of his motive.\u201d Dershowitz may be referring to the firing of James Comey or to reports that Trump has promised pardons for aides if they break laws while following his orders. Or he may merely be establishing the principle that Trump can\u2019t have committed an impeachable act of obstruction while exercising his constitutional powers.\n\nBut that can\u2019t be right. James Madison said during the Virginia ratifying convention that the Constitution provided \u201cone security\u201d against a president who urged a crime and then pardoned it: impeachment and removal.\n\nDershowitz\u2019s error about this specific example establishes his error on the general point, which is that Congress may impeach and remove a president for exercising a constitutional power in a corrupt or abusive manner.\n\nHe proceeds to issue another grant of immunity, which also falls apart under scrutiny. \u201cNeither is it a crime to conduct foreign policy for partisan or personal advantage,\u201d he writes, \u201ca common political sin with no limiting principle capable of being applied in a neutral manner.\u201d (While he never gives specifics, Dershowitz is clearly saying Trump should not be impeached for pushing Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.)\n\nIf Dershowitz means \u201ccrime\u201d to mean \u201cviolation of a statute,\u201d then his point is irrelevant. Impeachment is not limited to such violations, which is why the abuse of the pardon power can trigger it.\n\nPerhaps he instead means that it is not a \u201ccrime\u201d in the sense that it is not the kind of grave misconduct that justifies impeachment and removal. Whether that is true is of course a judgment that the Constitution leaves to Congress. Members of the House and Senate will have to decide whether pressuring a foreign government to supply dirt on a political rival is just as acceptable as pressuring a foreign country to supply a trade concession that is helpful in a swing state.\n\nThe question Dershowitz raises, then, is whether our reasonable and conscientious member of Congress should hesitate to vote against a president for conducting foreign policy for personal advantage because it requires making a judgment \u2013 because it necessitates acting on a standard that cannot be articulated in the mechanical way we would ideally want a legal rule to be.\n\nOne danger of impeaching a president for such a violation is that it will set a precedent that can be abused: Maybe some future Congress will act against a president who was merely seeking a trade concession. But the Constitution limits that danger by requiring a majority of the House and two-thirds of the Senate to remove a president. It\u2019s a safeguard that ought to reassure the statesmanlike legislator Dershowitz has in mind.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Once again, Alan Dershowitz, the former Harvard Law School professor, is mounting a defense of President Donald Trump against the threat of impeachment.In the past, Dershowitz has been willing to get creative in his legal arguments.
