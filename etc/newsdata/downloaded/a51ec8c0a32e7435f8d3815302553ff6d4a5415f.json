Now that there are more than 300 over-the-top video options available in the United States, \"subscription fatigue\" is a real thing, and new services from HBO (HBO Max), Apple (Apple TV+), and NBC (Peacock) are all set to join the already crowded field. Another big player on the horizon is Disney's forthcoming Disney+ site, which arrives on November 12. It promises to be the exclusive home for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Pixar films, the entire Star Wars franchise, and even The Simpsons. But as its full library announcement this week proved, Disney+ will also have a lot of other things... like weird, long-forgotten movies from the Disney archives.\n\nSurely, fans of Disney classics like Cinderella and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs will remember the 1978 film The Shaggy D.A., which is about a lawyer who \"keeps turning into a large, talking sheepdog at the worst possible moments.\" What about 1971's Million Dollar Duck, which was a feature-length exploration of what happens when a goose (or in this case, a duck) literally lays golden eggs? All these films and dozens just as bizarre are arriving to Disney+ on November 12. But because these movies are under-viewed and mostly lost to history, film titles like Bedknobs and Broomsticks end up sounding more like bands signed to Exploding In Sound than [checks notes] films about a jaunty, flying bed that helps children fight Nazis.\n\nTo make all of this even more confusing, we've made a quiz to test your knowledge: Is this phrase the name of an indie band, or a weird Disney movie?\n\nTry it out below.
