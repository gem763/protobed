The overall fall compared with a Reuters consensus forecast for a drop of 0.3 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe German economy is in the midst of a recession. Today\u2019s data make that clear again,\u201d said Thomas Gitzel, economist at VP Bank Group.\n\nThe economy shrank by 0.1 per cent in the second quarter, and recent data have pointed to continued weakness in manufacturing in the third quarter. Most economists define a recession as two straight quarters of contraction.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\n\u201cThe German government will probably come under growing pressure to give up its strict budget policy,\u201d added Gitzel.\n\nThe government has so far stuck to its balanced-budget policy, despite pressure from economists and other governments to spend more to boost flagging demand.\n\nFinance Minister Olaf Scholz said last week that Germany would be able to cope with an economic crisis but added that he did not expect a downturn to be as bad as it was in 2008/2009.\n\n\u201cThe weakness in demand in industry continues,\u201d the Economy Ministry said in a statement accompanying Monday\u2019s data. \u201cThe industrial sector remains subdued for the time being.\u201d\n\nGermany\u2019s export-reliant manufacturers are suffering from a slowing world economy and business uncertainty linked to a trade dispute between the United States and China as well as Britain\u2019s planned but delayed exit from the European Union.\n\nMonday\u2019s weaker-than-expected data added to the sense of gloom around the German manufacturing sector.\n\nA survey released last Tuesday showed the manufacturing recession deepened in September, with factories recording their weakest performance since the world financial crisis a decade ago.\n\nLast Wednesday, leading economic institutes slashed their growth forecasts for the economy for this year and next, blaming weaker global demand for manufacturing goods and increased business uncertainty linked to trade disputes.\n\nThe institutes also called on Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition government to ditch its budget policy of incurring no new debt if the growth outlook deteriorates. It has so far refused to do so.\n\nMerkel\u2019s government has managed to raise public spending without incurring new debt since 2014, thanks to an unusually long growth cycle, record-high employment, buoyant tax revenues and the European Central Bank\u2019s bond-buying plan.\n\nBut with the economy slowing and tax revenues waning, the fiscal room to counter a recession is getting smaller. At the same time, Germany\u2019s borrowing costs have turned into premiums, which means investors are actually willing to pay the state a bonus for being able to lend it billions of euros.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [BERLIN] German industrial orders fell more than expected in August on weaker domestic demand, data showed on Monday, adding to signs that a manufacturing slump is pushing Europe\u2019s largest economy into recession. .
