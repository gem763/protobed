It will also stream on MSNBC.com and the Post's website, as well as across mobile devices via NBC News and the Post's mobile apps and Urban One's digital platforms.\n\nThe city, venue and format will be announced at a later date, according to MSNBC.\n\nTo qualify for the stage, candidates have to meet fundraising and polling criteria laid out by the Democratic National Committee by one week before the debate.\n\nThose benchmarks include hitting at least 3 percent in four qualifying state or national polls or 5 percent in two qualifying state polls. The fundraising threshold requires candidates to have received contributions from 165,000 unique donors, including 600 unique donors in 20 states.\n\nThe eight candidates who appear to have qualified to date are former Vice President Joe Biden, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, billionaire Tom Steyer, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.\n\nFour other candidates appear to have reached the fundraising threshold, but are still short in the polling criteria. Minnesota Sen.
