You better kill him or take him out\u2026 He\u2019s big trouble,\u2019\" Mr Trump said on Sunday.\n\n\u201cNobody had ever heard of Osama bin Laden until the World Trade Centre,\u201d he added, incorrectly.\n\nHowever, Mr Trump\u2019s claim is inaccurate on several fronts.\n\nAlthough Bin Laden was mentioned in The America We Deserve, his appearance is fleeting at best and does not come in the form of a prediction about his threat.\n\nThe former al-Qaeda leader is referred to once in the book, in a passage about various security threats facing the US.\n\nIn a paragraph where Mr Trump and his co-author Dave Shiflett list potential dangers, he said: \u201cOne day we\u2019re told that a shadowy figure with no fixed address named Osama bin Laden is public enemy number one, and US jetfighters lay waste to his camp in Afghanistan. He escapes back under some rock, and a few news cycles later it\u2019s on to a new enemy and new crisis.\u201d\n\nMr Trump did predict a major terror attack would soon occur in the US and warned of an atrocity that would \u201cmake the [1993] bombing of the Trade Centre look like kids playing with firecrackers.\u201d\n\nHe did not, however, mention Bin Laden or al-Qaeda as potential perpetrators of such an attack.\n\nEven if the president's book had predicted Bin Laden was a significant threat, he would not have been the first person to make that observation.\n\nUS intelligence agencies were well aware of Bin Laden by 2000, as were many members of the general public following the 1998 United States embassy bombings which brought al-Qaeda to international attention.\n\nIn December 1998, then president Bill Clinton was informed by intelligence officials that al-Qaeda was making plans for attacks in the US, including training personnel to hijack an aircraft.\n\nBy 2000, Bin Laden was already on the FBI's lists of the \u201cten most wanted fugitives\u201d and \u201cmost wanted terrorists\u201d.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump announces Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi killed US raid", "description": "Donald Trump has falsely claimed he predicted the threat posed by Osama bin Laden before anyone else.In a press conference announcing the death of Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Mr Trump went on a bizarre tangent about his self-proclaimed foresight, claiming nobody listened to him when he said Bin", "authors": ["Conrad Duncan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/e4AaV8bXT.EgNCweRG1F6g--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/980dd22726ab0ae8aed3e00e304f29c7", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
