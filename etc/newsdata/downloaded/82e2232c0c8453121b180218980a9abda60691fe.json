This can turn an already chaotic mailbox into an unmanageable mess.\n\nA fix for this is to kill the Mail app from the multitasking tray and then reboot the iPhone. This should fix the issue, at least temporarily, and should buy you time until the next update lands.\n\nAnother interesting bug is that the notifications badge on the Mail icon is erratic and unreliable. There's no workaround for this, so it's a case of grinning and bearing it until Apple gets around to fixing it.\n\nAnother reported issue is the Mail app not retrieving email. Some users report that deleting the mail accounts and recreating them fixes these, but I've also seen reports of some people saying this hasn't helped, so it might be worth waiting for an update.\n\nHopefully iOS 13.2, which is scheduled to land September 24, will fix these issues.\n\nSee also:", "description": "The iOS Mail app has been a bit of a mess throughout the iOS 13 beta process, and it seems that some of these bugs have made it through to the final release.", "authors": ["Adrian Kingsley-Hughes"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/21/ff9cb588-6c07-400d-b6dc-2ae0c5995817/thumbnail/770x578/c3d0c7c4cb54f14375ac457f0daedb89/img-2588.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
