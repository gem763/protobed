You look for repeat buyers, growing sales and social media buzz. But how can financial advisers tell if their clients are satisfied?\n\nNew research from Vanguard sheds light on the inexact science of measuring the value of financial advice to investors. The mutual-fund giant has identified three types of metrics for advisers to assess their performance in working with clients: portfolio; financial, and emotional.\n\nPortfolio outcomes loom as the most obvious and longstanding focus of the financial planning business. By helping investors manage risk, diversify their holdings, and consistently produce returns that meet or exceed established benchmarks, advisers prove their value. The numbers tell the story.\n\nFinancial outcomes relate to the extent to which clients attain their goals. Advisers who help clients set long-term financial goals \u2014 from saving for their kids\u2019 college to seeking a secure retirement \u2014 elevate their role as coaches who blaze a path for individuals to save, spend and invest wisely based on a comprehensive financial plan.\n\nEmotional outcomes encompass the less objective but more critical human component of the adviser-client relationship. By building trust and forging a strong personal connection with a client, an adviser brings a sense peace of mind and security that goes beyond asset allocation and portfolio diversification.\n\n\u201cAll three elements of the framework are important,\u201d said Steve Utkus, global head of investor research for Vanguard Investment Strategy Group. \u201cAnd every adviser thinks of these three elements. But emotion is more important than you might imagine.\u201d\n\nFor Utkus, the framework presents a unified approach for advisers to evaluate the value of what they do. By measuring all three dimensions in an ongoing, rigorous manner, an adviser can solidify a bond with clients and increase the likelihood that they appreciate the effort and expertise.\n\nMeasuring portfolio and financial outcomes is fairly straightforward. Quantifying how a client\u2019s portfolio performs against benchmarks and assessing goal success rates involves data collection and analysis.\n\nThe tougher test is determining the emotional value of financial advice. It\u2019s hard for an adviser to grade an investor\u2019s trust level or whether they sleep soundly knowing that they\u2019re getting solid advice.\n\n\u201cThe big challenge in measuring emotional satisfaction is making sure it\u2019s not based on current market performance,\u201d Utkus said. \u201cOver the last five years, the numbers look great so you have to be skeptical of any measure you get.\u201d\n\nIdeally, advisers track emotional outcomes in different market environments by surveying clients in person, by phone, a personal letter, or email. Utkus suggests posing questions such as, \u201cDo you feel you can achieve financial success?\u201d and \u201cHow do you feel about your ability to withstand adverse events in your financial life?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should measure what the client feels psychologically about their financial situation,\u201d he said. \u201cOne way to do this is to come up with five questions to ask during your client reviews to assess their financial well-being.\u201d\n\nFinding answers about an investor\u2019s emotions can require some detective work. At investment adviser Carson Wealth, for example, surveys ask clients to rate a series of measures \u2014 from investment performance to the firm\u2019s communication \u2014 on a 1-to-10 scale. In a follow-up question, the firm asks, \u201cHow important is this to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone can rate us really high [in one area] but it\u2019s not that important to them,\u201d said Paul West, managing partner at Carson Wealth in Omaha, Neb. \u201cBuilding out their financial plan might be more important to them than their short-term investment performance. So we want to find out how we\u2019re doing and the relevance factor\u201d that a client assigns to each particular aspect of service.\n\n\u201cHands down, the emotional value is the biggest value you get from working with an adviser,\u201d West added. \u201cYou want to feel good.\u201d\n\nRead: Why the best person to give you money advice may NOT be an accountant or financial adviser", "description": "To measure their worth, many advisers see value in uncovering clients\u2019 emotions.", "authors": ["Morey Stettner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS405_beachm_ZG_20191001114239.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
