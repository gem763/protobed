Thanks for the support.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t like it, I\u2019m pretty sure there is a sprinter out there someone is going to gravitate to.\n\n\u201cI think I have the personality.\n\n\u201cI do enjoy it, I\u2019m not afraid to have fun and be a showman on the track.\u201d\n\nSILVER STREAK\n\nA born entertainer, Lyles will paint his hair silver for his races.\n\nHaving run the fastest 200m this season (19.50) and the fourth fastest of all time, Lyles is expected to top the podium in Doha but it will take more than silver hair and a gold medal to make people forget about Bolt.\n\nBefore Bolt\u2019s playful winning poses were mimicked around world, the Jamaican exploded into the spotlight smashing both the 100m and 200m world records which he still owns.\n\nLyles will compete in his first worlds looking to do something similar by taking down Bolt\u2019s 200m mark of 19.19 seconds.\n\n\u201cI still think 18 seconds is possible and if I obtain that I don\u2019t plan to stop there,\u201d said Lyles. \u201cI\u2019m going to push the boundaries as far as I can so who is ever next after me has a long way to go.\n\n\u201cIf it happens, it happens. I\u2019ll be excited. If it doesn\u2019t, I am going to enjoy the journey.\u201d\n\nWhile Lyles has many diverse interests, he has had to focus intensely on the task at hand.\n\nThat has meant two long gruelling months in Europe away from home.\n\n\u201cThe last two weeks it just got really hard I was homesick,\u201d he said. \u201cI was by myself, just going to bed, eating, training, recovery, repeat.\n\n\u201cThey were long days.\n\n\u201cI was like as long as I can make it out of this it will all be worth it.\n\n\u201cI just felt like I was being tested how strong my mental will to want this was and stay focused.\n\n\u201cKnowing that I got out of that part and I am finally here I feel like something great is on the other side.\u201d", "description": "The first world athletics championships in 16 years without Usain Bolt in the starting blocks get underway on Friday with the sport searching for someone to step into the starring role left vacant by the charismatic Jamaican sprinter.", "authors": ["Steve Keating", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434459559&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0IM-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
