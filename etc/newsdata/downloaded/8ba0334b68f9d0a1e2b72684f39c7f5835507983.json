(was) saying he couldn\u2019t lift the barrier without a ticket.\u201d\n\nThe mum phoned her husband who offered to pay by card but claimed staff refused to give her a number to make payment, reports Birmingham Live.\n\nMaria, who runs a children\u2019s catering business, said: \u201cI got in the Gracechurch Centre car park about 11.50am on Thursday.\n\n\u201cI usually have my ticket in my coat pocket or in my gym bag but I mislaid it. I don\u2019t take my purse.\n\n\u201cI was there just under an hour. I hadn\u2019t validated the ticket at the gym because I\u2019d lost it before I\u2019d left. I\u2019d looked in the gym locker and my bag. I looked everywhere for it.\n\n\u201cIt has happened once before. Probably about a year ago. I pressed the buzzer and a woman checked my registration number. You\u2019re only allowed two hours parking when you go to the gym. And I was let out.\n\n\u201cI thought I will just do the same as before. I pressed the help button. They said \u2018you are going to have to come in and pay\u2019. I said I didn\u2019t have any money on me and they told me I would have to pay some way.\u201d\n\nMaria spoke to a \u2018young guy\u2019 in the office and another staff member who she says refused to tell her who was in charge or give her any numbers to call to make a payment.\n\nThe tearful mum was increasingly desperate and called the police who said it was a civil matter.\n\nAt 1.10pm Maria called the nursery, in tears, to say she was going to be late - before her husband ended the crisis.\n\nShe said: \u201cMy husband managed to the number of his boss in London. His boss then called the man in the car park and all of a sudden he said \u2018just this once, I will take your details and let you go.\n\n\u201cI said to him \u2018You made me go through all of this. Getting me all worked up and leaving my daughter stranded.'\"\n\nMaria left the car park at around 1.45pm \u2013 around an hour after she was meant to and headed to Little Explorers Nursery in Streetly. The nursery waived any additional fee.\n\nShe has been a member at The Gym Group in Sutton for three years and said: \u201cI just can\u2019t believe there\u2019s people out there who have got no heart.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go back.\u201d\n\nAngela Henderson, centre manager at the Gracechurch Centre said: \u201cWe value all of our customers at The Gracechurch Centre and as part of this always seek to ensure the smooth running of the car park with clear signage about tariffs and our lost ticket policy \u2013 which we introduced following a spate of lost tickets last year.\n\n\u201cWe are sorry to hear of Ms Bensley\u2019s experience. We take the issues raised seriously and are fully investigating the matter.\n\n\"We are also liaising with our whole team, as we do regularly, to reiterate our customer service led approach.\u201d", "description": "Maria Bensley, 33, was left in tears after claiming staff at the car park in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, held her there for an hour while she was desperate to collect her daughter from nursery", "authors": ["Nick Horner"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20670391.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BLPP_CHP_PMI_16433JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
