Students at a Virginia high school find out.", "language": "en", "text": "He moved briskly through the hate he said he encountered: the man who tossed a noose at Bridges in his debut as a cheerleader, the classmate who pressed his forearm against Bridges\u2019s throat in a bathroom and threatened to kill him if he did not move.\n\nBridges is far removed from the experiences, having moved to Northern Virginia and enrolled at McLean High School, where he gave a presentation in the combating intolerance class. The elective has been offered in some iteration at other Fairfax County Public Schools for years, but this is the first time it has been taught at McLean.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are no textbooks or tests, no prescribed curriculum for teacher Julia Braxton to follow. The topics are provocative, primed for disagreement and discomfort. Over the course of a school year, students will be pushed to confront, interrogate and, in some instances, revise their understanding of racism, immigration, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, genocide and ableism.\n\nThey are the types of lessons that can be fraught. Last month, a white teacher in Virginia Beach sued a school system after she was fired over an exercise designed to teach about racial and other stereotypes. She argued in court papers that photos of the assignment were taken out of context online.\n\nBut the teenagers at McLean High are coming of age amid growing social awareness and accountability, illustrated by the student-led protests demanding action on climate change and by the #MeToo movement, which has compelled men to answer for wrongdoings dating back decades.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSeveral students said they feel a responsibility to talk openly about bias discrimination, viewing the conversations as necessary to understanding the world and how animus drives conflict.\n\n\u201cIt just seems like people now are looking back at America\u2019s past, at the world\u2019s past, and seeing these horrible injustices and seeing them in this light,\u201d Rachel Kulp, 17, said. \u201cThere has been some change but there hasn\u2019t been enough, and we need to take it upon ourselves.\u201d\n\nIn the first weeks of school, Braxton had students trace the history of a stereotype. Then they challenged it, dismantling the trope or explaining the nuances and harm it may cause.\n\nBridges talked about how characteristics traditionally associated with masculinity \u2014 strong, aggressive, straight \u2014 hurt men who do not exhibit those qualities. Asian American students shared how they were damaged by expectations that accompany the model minority stereotype. A student who is Mormon spoke about ignorant comments directed at his religious community.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey have also started to learn more about one another. Easton Freeman, the student whose project focused on Mormon stereotypes, said he was stunned to learn about the homophobia Bridges experienced.\n\n\u201cGrowing up in a white, conservative home, there was a lot of things that were never brought to my attention because my environment did not bring it up,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cI thought that, truly, everybody was past it and it was just something that people over exaggerated.\u201d\n\nAnother student, Rebecca Blacksten, chose the stereotype of the overbearing Jewish mother for her class project. It compelled her to re-examine the ways she has talked about her Jewish heritage.\n\nAD\n\nLast school year, the 17-year-old performed a stand-up comedy routine that relied on Jewish stereotypes. The audience laughed and she viewed the performance as a success \u2014 until she watched the video again for the combating intolerance class.\n\nAD\n\nAs she plunged into the class, she became embarrassed for \u201cplaying into stereotypes that Nazis perpetuated.\u201d She thought about her great-grandparents, who survived the Holocaust and who were disparaged for their religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cMy great-grandmother was, her entire life, running away from things because of stereotypes that I\u2019m now using to make people laugh,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just made me really upset.\u201d\n\nShe said she views learning about intolerance in class as a way to prevent persecution, to keep atrocities from happening in the future.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere are men who don\u2019t think they have to go to the Women\u2019s March because they\u2019re not women, and there are straight people who feel like they don\u2019t have to support the LGBTQ community because they\u2019re not LGBTQ,\u201d she said. \u201cThis class has been so important in everybody realizing that if they stand up and say something, it can make a difference.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe students are aware that McLean is, in some respects, a bubble: The community\u2019s median household income exceeds $193,000 a year, and the student body espouses mostly liberal political views, they said. Students said they feel the school is generally accepting.\n\nBut some teenagers were drawn to the course to \u201cpop that bubble,\u201d said Braxton, a social science teacher. Many of the 11th- and 12th-graders in the class come from privilege, the teacher said, but are empathetic and compassionate toward those who face intolerance and inequality.\n\nAD\n\nShe agreed to teach the class, which meets every other day during first period, because she said she did not feel there was enough time to adequately discuss social issues and intolerance that inevitably arise during lessons in the AP government courses she teaches.\n\nAD\n\nHer goals for the class vary, depending on the student. For some, it\u2019s a matter of getting them to \u201cacknowledge their privilege.\u201d For others, it is about developing the skills to advocate for change.\n\n\u201cObviously, we can\u2019t solve racism in this class, but we can take baby steps,\u201d Braxton said. \u201cWhere else are they going to be able to talk about this? Where else are my students of color going to have an outlet to be able to be respected and share their experiences, within this building?\u201d\n\nFor one of their first assignments, students were assigned an activity that made them responsible for \u201chiring\u201d people based on a few pieces of information, including photos and names.\n\nAD\n\nStudents chose not to hire a pregnant woman because she would eventually go on maternity leave. They decided against another woman because she appeared \u201caggressive.\u201d A man who students believed was Muslim was dismissed because some feared he would be \u201ctoxic.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHannah Tsai, an Asian American student who has described the harmfulness of the \u201ctiger mom\u201d stereotype to her classmates, said she strives to be open-minded but the assignment unearthed biases she was unaware she had. \u201cIt really shocked me what kinds of underlying prejudices I already had ingrained in me,\u201d Tsai said.\n\nHaving grown up in McLean, Camille Blakemore, 16, said it was \u201ckind of hard for me to comprehend\u201d examples of hate and discrimination shared by classmates who have lived elsewhere.\n\nAD\n\nClass discussions also made the teenager realize she harbors an unconscious bias toward Republicans. She appreciates that the class pushes students to listen to one another and \u201csee past the initial things that might turn you off from somebody\u2019s opinion.\u201d\n\nOthers at the school assume that the students enrolled in the class share similar social and political views, said Lauren Thompson, a 17-year-old who chose the stereotype that \u201cblack people are poor\u201d to explain systemic racism and how federal policies have created wealth disparities.\n\nAD\n\nThey assume that \u201ceven though we\u2019re so into diversity, that our thought processes are so homogeneous,\u201d Thompson said. But she said that isn\u2019t true \u2014 there is disagreement and discussion.\n\nThe teenager said she has always felt a responsibility to understand \u201cwhy things are the way things are in America and the world.\u201d And she has been exposed to problems and perspectives she had not previously thought much about, such as the challenges faced by people with disabilities.", "description": "The teenagers are coming of age at a time of growing social awareness and accountability.", "authors": ["Debbie Truong", "Reporter Covering Virginia Schools"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4SAc8qdTd11XBWRUita6bjbyyhI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QIDL44HBLUI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
