Even with a weakened team, there\u2019s no doubt that it\u2019d take something special from Namibia to topple the two-time world champions. Do they have it in their locker? No, probably not. A thumping win for South Africa.", "description": "South Africa\u00a0will be looking to bounce back from their Rugby World Cup defeat against New Zealand when they take on Namibia.
