We don\u2019t see the wide array of targeting.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign, she said, \u201cis like a supercar racing a little Volkswagen Bug.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats would be the Volkswagen. The are largely running what other experts and political operatives compared to brand-loyalty campaigns, trying to sway moderates and offend as few people as possible, despite mounting research that suggests persuasion ads have little to no impact on voters in a general election.\n\nThe candidates, to be sure, are collectively spending more on Facebook and Google than on television and are trying to target their ads \u2014 Mr. Biden\u2019s tend to be seen by those born before 1975, for instance, while Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s are aimed at those born later. But without the same level of message testing and data collection, the Democrats\u2019 efforts are not nearly as robust as Mr. Trump\u2019s.\n\n[Read more on how Democrats are using Facebook to reach specific voters.]\n\nDemocratic digital operatives say the problem is a party dominated by an aging professional political class that is too timid in the face of a fiercely partisan Republican machine. The Biden campaign\u2019s decision to tack from digital to television, they say, is only the most glaring example of a party hung up on the kind of broad-based advertising that played well in the television age but fares poorly on social media.\n\nThe digital director of a prominent Democratic presidential campaign recounted how he was shut down by an older consultant when pressing for shorter, pithier ads that could drive clicks. \u201cWe don\u2019t need any of your cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 clickbait,\u201d the consultant snapped, according to the digital director, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid risking his job.\n\nOther digital consultants and campaign officials told similar stories, and complained that the Democratic establishment was too focused on winning over imagined moderates, instead of doing what the Trump campaign has done: firing up its base.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that anodyne messaging doesn\u2019t turn anyone off. But it doesn\u2019t turn them on either,\u201d said Elizabeth Spiers, who runs the Insurrection, a progressive digital strategy and polling firm.", "description": "That campaigns are now being fought largely online campaign is hardly a revelation, yet only one political party seems to have gotten the message.", "authors": ["Matthew Rosenberg", "Kevin Roose"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/20/us/20digitalcampaign-web/20digitalcampaign-web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
