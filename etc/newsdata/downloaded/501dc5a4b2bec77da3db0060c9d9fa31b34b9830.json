Chile is home to several of the world\u00b4s largest miners, including BHP Group Ltd, Anglo American Plc, Teck Resources Ltd and Antofagasta Plc.\n\n\u201cThere have been no attacks (at the mines). On the contrary, they are operating normally,\u201d Prokurica said.\n\nProkurica added that the companies had taken measures to ensure shift workers could enter the mines despite countrywide transportation blockages.\n\nMajor streets and highways around Santiago were shut down over the weekend, and flights in and out of the city were suspended or canceled as crew members and airport staff were unable to get to work.\n\nMost of Chile\u00b4s major mines are located in the northern third of the country, far from population centers.", "description": "Chile\u00b4s mining industry was running as normal despite the violent protests that have rocked the capital, Santiago, and other cities across the world\u00b4s top copper producer, Mining Minister Baldo Prokurica said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Fabian Cambero", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
