But now, after announcing her split from estranged husband, Channing Tatum, back in April 2018, and finding new love with actor Steve Kazee, the 38-year-old has also become an author.\n\nIn her new book, Gracefully You: Finding Beauty and Balance in the Everyday, Dewan shares the journey that she\u2019s gone through in the past year and a half with the biggest of life changes. Most notably has been how she\u2019s prepared herself to become a new mom again \u2014 something that her daughter was pulling for.\n\n\u201c\u2018The whole class has brothers and sisters but me,\u2019\u201d Dewan recalled her daughter telling her and partner Kazee while speaking with Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nIn September, Dewan and Kazee announced that they are expecting their first child together, which Dewan explains made Everly very happy. \u201cShe just looked at me and was like, \u2018Wait, for reals?\u2019\u201d\n\nAlthough Everly was enthusiastic about the news, Dewan explained that being pregnant has also left her beyond excited. She\u2019s actually felt inspired to create and even find balance during this second pregnancy, which she credits to her \u201cdeeper earth mama sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love being pregnant,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m much more aware of things, my dreams are crazy. I like to do all kinds of things like meditations and prenatal yoga, and I do a lot of things that kind of help you connect to yourself and to the life that you\u2019re creating.\u201d\n\nDewan went onto explain that she does a lot of her meditation with crystals, which she talks about in the book. The collection of poems, stories and lifestyle tips was inspired by these practices that have encouraged her to \u201clet go and let the flow\u201d in all areas of her life.\n\n\u201cSurrendering and letting go and trusting has been a really, really big thing for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m full L.A. hippie now.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Jenna Dewan opens up about her second pregnancy while having a 6-year-old daughter at home.", "authors": ["Kerry Justich"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2AaQH0Nxx1xM3dgjbHvPDw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/0ccc5380-f9cd-11e9-bbee-f6dcf9624224", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
