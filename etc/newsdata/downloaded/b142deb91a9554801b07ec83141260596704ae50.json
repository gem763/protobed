It's the first time live rounds have been reported.\n\nTuesday is China's National Day, and the 70th anniversary of China's Communist Party. It is a major national celebration.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe Hong Kong protests escalated Tuesday as a protester was shot with a live round for the first time in 17 weeks of demonstrations, while police reported being doused in acid.\n\nThe protests - timed to coincide with China's National Day, and the 70th anniversary of the ruling Communist Party - took on a dark character at multiple clashes around the city.\n\nA male protester was shot in the chest by police using live rounds on Hoi Pa Street, in the city's Tsuen Wan district, on Tuesday, The Associated Press reported, citing police officials.\n\nIt marks the first time live rounds have been used by police during the 17 weeks of protest.\n\nA video posted to Facebook shows a masked protester lying in pain on the ground, purportedly the victim of the gunfire, calling out: \"My chest is in pain, take me to the hospital.\"\n\nIn a separate confrontation, protesters used an acid-like substance on police officers. The Hong Kong Police posted images of their officer's burns on Twitter.\n\nThe account wrote: \"Rioters have used corrosive fluid in Tuen Mun area, injuring multiple Police officers and reporters.\"\n\n\"The Police strongly condemn the violent acts and appeal to members of the public to mind their personal safety.\"\n\nThe Times also reported that \"seven masked men used a Molotov cocktail to burn posters of Xi Jinping outside a Chinese Army barracks\" on Tuesday.\n\nThe escalation comes at a symbolic time in China.\n\nTuesday marks 70 years since the Chinese communist party, led by founder Mao Zedong, seized control of the country during a bloody civil war.\n\nThe milestone was commemorated by a huge parade in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, featuring a show of military might from The People's Liberation Army.\n\nMinistry of Defense spokesman major general Cai Zhijun said last week the parade would be comprised of 15,000 troops, 580 tanks, and 160 fighter aircraft.\n\nAt the parade, after weeks of speculation, China finally unveiled the Dongfeng-41 (DF-41, CSS-X-10) missile. It's believed to be the world's longest intercontinental weapon, which can strike targets 9,320 miles away.\n\nIn a post on Facebook on Saturday, the Hong Kong edition of Chinese state newspaper China Daily warned that Hong Kong \"anti-government fanatics\" were \"baying for blood\" ahead of the celebrations.\n\nOn Tuesday, protesters in Hong Kong marched 2.5 miles from Causeway Bay to Central, Bloomberg reported. Figo Chan, a leader in the Civil Human Rights Front, said that more than 100,000 protesters marched.\n\nHong Kong Police on Monday warned that planned protests in the city were expected to be \"very, very dangerous\" and claimed that hardliners had called on people to murder police and set fire to gas stations.\n\nAs Business Insider's Rosie Perper previously reported, chief superintendent John Tse Chun-Chung gave no evidence to substantiate the claims.\n\nRead more: Protesters in Hong Kong may have almost won this battle - but the fight for freedom and identity is far from over", "description": "Protests entered a 17th week in Hong Kong on Tuesday, which is China's National Day and the 70th anniversary of the ruling Communist Party.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9419/aff1d4e850d14e9ab908e67b87de6867.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
