Starring: Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Joel Edgerton, Sean Harris, Lily-Rose Depp, Robert Pattinson, and Ben Mendelsohn. 15 cert, 140 mins\n\nRobert Pattinson\u2019s impression of a Frenchman in Netflix\u2019s The King is a minor act of war. There\u2019s no other possible interpretation. His post-Twilight career has been fascinating precisely because he\u2019s never been careless in his choices. And, as Good Time and The Lighthouse proved, he\u2019s also very skilled at accents. Which makes his appearance as the Dauphin in David Mich\u00f4d\u2019s revisionist take on Shakespeare\u2019s Henriad plays either a feat of performance art or deliberate trolling, thanks to its Pep\u00e9 Le Pew tones and \u201cer\u2026 how do you say?\u201d laboured hesitancy. \u201cI enjoy to speak English. It is simple and ugly,\u201d he splutters at one point.\n\nAnd yet, as a welcome moment of chaos in an otherwise exhaustingly solemn affair, his work is the undeniable highlight of The King. There is, admittedly, a slice of genius in the film\u2019s concept: Mich\u00f4d and co-writer Joel Edgerton have sought to rip the history out of Shakespeare\u2019s pages, trading in lengthy soliloquies for the mud, blood, and rage of the medieval battlefield. Not only does the film jettison the playwright\u2019s language, but the film\u2019s plot toys with the source material \u2013 Henry IV, Parts 1 & 2 and Henry V \u2013 with little concern for faithfulness.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe King\u2019s interest is in Henry V (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet), still a boy in many respects, who\u2019s ascendancy to the throne is sudden and uneasy. He is not his father\u2019s (Ben Mendelsohn) favoured child, but the death of his brother (Dean-Charles Chapman) has given the kingdom no choice. As distrust in the former bad boy philanderer grows, Henry must face the weight of his own legacy. He despises the bloodshed his father revelled in, but what else is he to do when France (and the Dauphin) are goading him into war?\n\nYet, for all its reinventions (including a very different fate for Falstaff), the film goes the same way as most Shakespeare big-screen adaptations go, mistaking laboured reverence for dramatic intensity. Outside of Pattinson\u2019s subversive contributions, The King is afraid of levity to the point that it mangles the story. We constantly hear characters talk about Henry as the \u201cwhoring fool\u201d but, onscreen, he\u2019s guilty of nothing more than sleeping in late and having tussled, boy band hair. It\u2019s strange to see Chalamet\u2019s theatre-dork-meets-cool-kid charisma so dramatically reined in here. The script gives him little to play with other than the opportunity to look pensive, as he delivers all his lines in a tortured whisper. Edgerton gets more room to run and breathe \u2013 his Falstaff is world-weary and caustic, having seen too much death to get caught up in the bickering of the royal court.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Hidden gems: The best Netflix originals you might have missed 1/20 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017\u2013) Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix\u2019s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don\u2019t let that, or the show\u2019s bland English-language title, put you off \u2013 creator \u00c1lex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off \u20ac2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show\u2019s 15 episodes than there are hostages. Netflix 2/20 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u20132018) Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It\u2019s been cancelled now, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email. Netflix 3/20 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u2013) In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV \u2013 the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh \u2013 One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn\u2019t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran / nurse / single mother \u2013 who suffers from PTSD and depression \u2013 would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process. Netflix 4/20 Private Life (Film, 2018) Based on writer / director Tamara Jenkins\u2019s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie\u2019s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It\u2019s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised. Netflix 5/20 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u2013) Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep dive into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show\u2019s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly \u2013 and seemingly disastrously \u2013 changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones; Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig\u2019s wonderful turn as a talking vagina. Netflix 6/20 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016\u2013) Joe Swanberg\u2019s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn\u2019t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you\u2019ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams \u2013 who you might remember from Todd Solondz\u2019s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness \u2013 is the show\u2019s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul. Netflix 7/20 Love (TV series, three seasons, 2016\u20132018) Community\u2019s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely \u2013 and arguably deeply unwise \u2013 relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus\u2019s pathological need to be the nice guy, we\u2019re never quite sure who or what we\u2019re rooting for \u2013 which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing. Netflix 8/20 Patton Oswalt: Annihilation (stand-up special, 2017) In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt\u2019s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn\u2019t exactly scream \u201cstand-up special\u201d, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone. Netflix 9/20 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u2013) Granted, this horror-comedy \u2013 which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh \u2013 is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it\u2019s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila\u2019s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair\u2019s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn\u2019t quite like anything else on TV right now. Netflix 10/20 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018\u2013) New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is \u2013 in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he\u2019s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier\u2019s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world\u2019s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier\u2019s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims. Netflix 11/20 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018\u2013) Based on Vikram Chandra\u2019s epic 2006 novel, Netflix\u2019s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games \u2013 which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster \u2013 only covered one quarter of Chandra\u2019s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, \u201cthe worst is yet to come\u201d. Netflix 12/20 Dumplin\u2019 (Film, 2018) When the trailer for Dumplin\u2019 first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin\u2019 such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described \u201cfat girl\u201d who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin\u2019 is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist \u2013 and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot. Netflix 13/20 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017\u2013) This sci-fi thriller \u2013 which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties \u2013 has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things. Netflix 14/20 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017) Though it\u2019s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015\u2019s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992. Netflix 15/20 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018\u2013) This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 \u2013 meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward\u2019s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life. John O Flexor/Netflix 16/20 Set It Up (Film, 2018) Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term \u201cover-dicking\u201d (it\u2019s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre. Netflix 17/20 Cargo (Film, 2017) Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable spanners in the works. Netflix 18/20 3% (TV series, two season, 2016\u2013) Like a cross between The Hunger Games and CW series The 100, this Brazilian dystopian thriller, set in an unspecified future, revolves largely around an impoverished community known as the Inland. Every year, each 20-year-old takes part in a series of tests; the highest scoring 3% will be chosen to live in paradise in the Offshore. It is an intriguing and addictive commentary on class and privilege. Netflix 19/20 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017\u2013) With shades of John Ford's The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it's about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws\u2019 pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O\u2019Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O\u2019Connell, are on brilliant form. Netflix 20/20 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u2013) This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness \u2013 as too many shows tend to do \u2013 it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season. Netflix 1/20 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017\u2013) Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix\u2019s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don\u2019t let that, or the show\u2019s bland English-language title, put you off \u2013 creator \u00c1lex Pina has made something special.

Netflix\n\nBut the screenplay\u2019s stiff approach to characterisation is the result of how much it\u2019s trying to cram into one film.
