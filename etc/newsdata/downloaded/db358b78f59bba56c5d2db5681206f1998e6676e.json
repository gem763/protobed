Tens of thousands of people attended Nusrat Jahan Rafi\u2019s funeral prayers in her hometown, and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina pledged that her family would get quick justice.\n\nAll of the defendants, including a local ruling party member and some students at the school, were in the court in handcuffs during the reading of the verdict. The principal, who had smiled as he was brought into the court, cried after the verdict was announced, local media reported. The defendants began shouting and screaming as they were taken away in a police van.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

When she refused, she said her hands were tied and she was doused in kerosene and set on fire. She told the story to her brother in an ambulance as she was taken to a hospital and he recorded it on his mobile phone.\n\nShe died four days later with burns covering 80% of her body.\n\nThe violence shook Bangladesh, triggering protests and raising concerns over the plight of women and girls in the conservative Muslim-majority nation of 160 million people, where sexual harassment and violence are often unreported, victims are intimidated and the legal process is lengthy. Many avoid reporting to police because of social stigma.\n\nPolice also often show an unwillingness to investigate such cases and are accused of being influenced by local politics or bribes, according to human rights groups.\n\nDays before Rafi was set on fire, she filed a complaint with police that the principal of her madrasa had called her into his office and repeatedly touched her inappropriately. Her family agreed to help her to file the complaint, which prompted police to arrest the principal, infuriating him and his supporters. Influential local politicians backed the principal.\n\nPolice told the court that the suspects told them during interrogations that the attack on Rafi was planned and ordered by the principal from prison when his supporters visited him. They said it was timed for daytime so it would look like a suicide attempt.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "19-year-old Nusrat Jahan Rafi was murdered after making a sexual harassment complaint against the principal of her Islamic school", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/nusrat-rafi-16-sentenced-death-bangladesh.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
