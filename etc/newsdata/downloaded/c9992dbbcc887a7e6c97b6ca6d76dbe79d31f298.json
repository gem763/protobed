Sometimes I think I had a decent game, but apparently there's something wrong after all. But those are only opinions. It's important to know what I do well and what went wrong - and I know that well.\n\nManager Maurizio Sarri was rumoured to have told the Dutchman to go on a low-carb diet\n\n'Every new player should get the time to adapt to the team. Juventus had two great defenders already with Chiellini and Bonucci.\n\n'The plan was to let me enter the team slowly, but it worked out differently.\n\n'Obviously it's great that I get to play already, but you get thrown in at the deep end right away. That's a great challenge for me.'\n\nDe Ligt says he has learnt a handful of valuable lessons since joining the Serie A side, admitting he was too conscious about making errors when he first arrived - and now believes he has found the answer to consistency.\n\nDe Ligt makes a crunching tackle on Inter Milan striker Lautaro Martinez in the Derby d'Italia\n\n'The most important lesson I have learned so far at Juventus is that you need self-confidence,' he added. 'In the beginning, I noticed I was way too concerned about not making mistakes and that's exactly what you shouldn't do.\n\n'After that game against Atletico Madrid I called myself to order, in a way. I wanted to play with confidence again. Maybe still some things will go wrong, but at least I know for sure things are better than before. Since then I have an upward trend.'\n\nThe centre-back played the full 90 minutes as Juventus overcame Serie A title rivals Inter Milan 2-1 in the Derby d'Italia.\n\nDe Ligt's handball had allowed Lautaro Martinez to convert a penalty to cancel out Paulo Dybala's opener - although Gonzalo Higuain netted a late winner.", "description": "The Dutchman signed for the Italian giants for\u00a0\u20ac75million (\u00a367.8m) in the summer after captaining Ajax to the Champions League semi-finals with a series of colossal displays.", "authors": ["Oli Gamp For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/23/19417230-0-image-a-26_1570488046521.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
