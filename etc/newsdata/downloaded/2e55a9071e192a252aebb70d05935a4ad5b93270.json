It is one of his first opinions; Alston was sworn in as a federal judge in August.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very pleased, of course,\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 attorney Victor Glasberg said. \u201cThe only unfortunate part is that it took a United States district judge to strike a Jim Crow provision that the state of Virginia insisted on defending in court.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThree couples challenged the racial requirement last month, saying they had tried and failed to obtain marriage licenses without identifying by race. Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring quickly issued new guidance and a new marriage application form to clerks across the state, saying they should allow anyone to decline to answer the race question. At a court hearing last week, a lawyer for Herring\u2019s office argued that the issue was now resolved until at least 2022, when a new attorney general will take his place.\n\n\u201cHad they brought this concern to officials, it could have been resolved without a lawsuit,\u201d Virginia Solicitor General Toby J. Heytens said in court.\n\nAD\n\nBut the couples argued, and Alston agreed, that their concerns remained valid because the law requiring a racial designation was still on the books.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHerring provided a construction of the statute that is expressly at odds with its plain meaning,\u201d Alston wrote.\n\nHe also disputed the contention that there is no \u201cstraight line\u201d between a 1924 state law prohibiting interracial marriage and the requirement to choose a race when getting married. On the contrary, in his order he agreed with Glasberg that the law reflected a racist and segregationist past embodied in the first state registrar of vital statistics, a white supremacist named Walter Plecker.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen asked by this Court at oral argument whether there was any state interest in this racial data, Defendants conceded there was not,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe statutory scheme is a vestige of the nation\u2019s and of Virginia\u2019s history of codified racialization.\u201d\n\nMichael K. Kelly, a spokesman for the Virginia Office of the Attorney General, said in a statement the ruling was \u201cconsistent with AG Herring\u2019s recent memo to the State Registrar noting that \u2018any statute requiring a governmental official to deny a marriage license to an applicant who declines to provide information about his or her race would raise serious constitutional questions.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD", "description": "He agreed with couples who argued the law was a vestige of segregation.", "authors": ["Rachel Weiner", "Local Reporter Covering Federal Court In Alexandria", "Va.", "Local Court In Arlington"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/JLT-EUpIYfsdLz29_07CreS-UTw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CYSQDSDKSII6RHRYETTJHM4GG4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
