But a quick booster burst of electricity using the service station network of chargers should supply you with enough power while you're supping on a coffee and stretching your legs.\n\nThe manufacturer claims drivers can boost the battery to 80 per cent capacity in just 54 minutes when it's plugged into the most powerful (100kW) super-fast charger, or 1 hour and 15 minutes with a 50kW version.\n\nA full-charge with a 7.2kW charger will take 9 hours 50 minutes. While using a simple domestic plug will treble that to 29 hours.\n\nRegenerative braking also helps boost electric charge on the move by reclaiming energy that would otherwise be lost.\n\nThe Kia e-Niro is the sibling of the Hyundai Kona Electric and share many of the same underpinnings\n\nKia claims drivers can boost the battery to 80% capacity in just 54 minutes when it's plugged into the most powerful (100kW) super-fast charger, or 1 hour and 15 minutes with a 50kW version\n\nOn a full charge, the Kia Niro has an impressive driving range of 282 miles\n\nThe e-Niro will teach you to be a better electric-car driver\n\nThe car will even coach the driver on how to improve range by recommending when to coast and when to brake- allowing the battery to regenerate with more power while still in motion.\n\nKia said: \u2019The Coasting Guide Control alerts drivers as to the best time to lift off the accelerator and coast towards a junction, allowing the battery to regenerate under engine deceleration.\u2019\n\nPaddles behind the steering wheel \u2013 used like gears despite there being a single continuous automatic transmission \u2013 allow drivers to choose between three levels of energy recuperation by the regenerative brakes.\n\nThe car will even coach the driver on how to improve range by recommending when to coast and when to brake- allowing the battery to regenerate with more power while still in motion\n\nThe heavy batteries are located between the two axles, meaning the centre of gravity is low to improve stability\n\nThe e-Niro's relatively low price - compared to rival electric models - could make it a viable option for Britons when it arrives next year\n\nAnd you can track your remaining charge using the eight-inch touchscreen on the dashboard.\n\nNot only does it update you on the range that's left in the battery pack but also highlights the nearest public charging points and even allowing owners to measure their lifetime CO2 emissions \u2013 and how much less this would be than a conventional petrol car of similar size.\n\nAnother seven-inch screen in the instrument cluster shows power flows to and from the battery, and can score the driver according to how economically they are driving.\n\nThe lack of a conventional petrol or diesel engine means it is very quiet \u2013 and almost silent \u2013 to the extent that people can\u2019t hear you coming, especially at low speed in areas with lots of pedestrians. So you do have to be extra careful.\n\nFortunately, the car is nimble enough to perform evasive manoeuvres.\n\nThis is partly thanks to the batteries being located between the two axles, meaning the centre of gravity is low to improve stability.\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a You can track your remaining charge using the 8-inch touchscreen on the dashboard. It even tells you how much further you could travel if you turned the air conditioning off\n\nAnother seven-inch screen in the instrument cluster shows power flows to and from the battery, and can score the driver according to how economically they are driving\n\nLaunch models come with full leather and are fully loaded with kit and safety features\n\nIt should be practical, safe and is covered by a 7-year warranty\n\nThe Kia e-Niro is available in five paint colours, including a shade called Pluto Brown that is unique to the model. However, if you want \u2018premium\u2019 paint you have to pay \u00a3565 extra.\n\nIn terms of practicality, there are 451 litres of space in the boot \u2013 with a compartment beneath the floor to store the charging cable \u2013 and flexible seating allows the rear seats to fold down to liberate even more space for load-lugging journeys.\n\nIt should be safe too, thanks to a host of safety systems including electronic stability and traction control, a driver awareness warning, and adaptive smart cruise control which matches the car\u2019s speed to the flow of traffic and brakes automatically if a car cuts in front.\n\nFor peace of mind, Kia\u2019s industry-leading seven-year/100.000 mile warranty also covers the e-Niro\u2019s battery pack and the electric motor, and is fully transferable if the car is sold within the time or mileage limits.\n\nThere's plenty of rear legroom for passengers. And because it's electric it means there's no high transmission tunnel for the person sat in the middle seat\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a There are 451 litres of space in the boot with the seat-backs up. Flexible seating allows the rear seats to fold down to liberate even more space for load-lugging journeys\n\nThere's a small storage compartment under the boot floor to carry the charging cables", "description": "Ray Massey has travelled all the way to the de-militarised zone - or DMZ - separating South from North Korea to try Kia's answer to the Jaguar I-Pace and Tesla Model X, the all-new e-Niro SUV.", "authors": ["Ray Massey For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
