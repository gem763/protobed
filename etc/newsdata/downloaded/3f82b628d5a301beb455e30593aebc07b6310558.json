Bears are second in league, with six points allowed. \u2026 RB Dalvin Cook leads NFL with 375 rushing yards. He\u2019s one of only five players in league history to start season with at least 110 yards and one TD in each of first three games, joining Pro Football Hall of Fame members Jim Brown, O.J. Simpson, Emmitt Smith and Curtis Martin. \u2026 Vikings brought back WR Laquon Treadwell, native of Chicago suburb Crete, after cutting 2016 first-round draft pick at end of training camp. \u2026 Vikings also brought back CB/PR Marcus Sherels this week, after placing WR/PR Chad Beebe on injured reserve.
