Barrick has taken the lead in the negotiations.\n\nBut the government is yet to lift a ban on the export of gold concentrates that has crippled Acacia\u2019s revenue and two Acacia employees and a former employee are still in jail in Tanzania.\n\nThe original takeover bid from Barrick, which already owned 63.9% of Acacia, had drawn accusations from minority shareholders that Barrick was taking advantage of the company\u2019s woes in Tanzania to buy it on the cheap.\n\nBut an improved bid in July was received positively by the shareholders, and Tanzania-focused Acacia shares have gained over one-fourth in value since.\n\nBarrick offered 0.168 of its shares for one Acacia share, up from the initial offer of 0.153. The sweetened offer valued Acacia at about 232 pence per share, or 951 million pounds ($1.2 billion).\n\nThe deal ends Acacia\u2019s near-decade presence on the London Stock Exchange. Acacia shares, which have lost more than half of their value since a 2010 market debut, will be delisted with effect from Sept. 18, Acacia said.\n\n(Graphic: Acacia vs FTSE 250 , here)", "description": "Canadian miner Barrick Gold has won approval from a British court for its $1.2 billion takeover of Acacia Mining , the African gold miner said on Friday, removing the last hurdle to the conclusion of the deal.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
