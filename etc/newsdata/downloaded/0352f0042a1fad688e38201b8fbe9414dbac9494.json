Even if the bloc had reopened talks it had declared closed at the end of last year, \u201cin reality it was London that made the biggest gesture, by agreeing to customs checks between the UK and Northern Ireland\u201d.\n\nBoris Johnson plays numbers game after securing Brexit deal Read more\n\nThis, the paper said, was \u201csupremely symbolic\u201d. The EU27 had adopted the deal \u201cbut without many illusions about how long it might last, such were the doubts over whether they would ever actually accept it\u201d. And at the moment, \u201ceverything indicates MPs will not back it: the arithmetic is merciless.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s gamble is high-risk, the paper said. \u201cBut the British prime minister knows it, and for him the most important thing is not that parliament approves the deal. What really matters to Johnson is to be able to present something concrete to parliament \u2013 and, above all, to future voters.\u201d\n\nGermany\u2019s Die Welt agreed the prime minister was the big winner \u2013 even if he loses Saturday\u2019s vote. \u201cAt first glance, the outlook for Johnson is not good,\u201d it said. \u201cHe lacks votes on both sides of the house. But if MPs are faced with a choice between Johnson\u2019s deal and no deal, they may well vote for an orderly exit.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd even if he loses,\u201d it added, \u201cthe EU will give him an extension long enough to organise elections. He can say he has a deal. The opposition can offer only unknowns, and an even longer Brexit drama \u2013 and the Brits are exhausted. Brexit may not come on 31 October. But it is coming, and most likely under a prime minister Johnson.\u201d\n\n'Outrageous': European newspapers react to No 10's Brexit strategy Read more\n\nThe Irish Times said in an editorial that the concessions on the EU side had been \u201cless substantial than those made by London\u201d. Yes, the backstop was gone, the paper said. \u201cBut the price Johnson has paid is his acceptance of the very thing \u2013 Northern Ireland in the EU customs union \u2013 that the backstop would, if activated, have produced.\u201d\n\nLast year, it observed, \u201cJohnson said no British prime minister could ever accept a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea. He just has.\u201d As it stood, the deal was \u201cgood for Dublin, in that it ensures no border infrastructure in Ireland. For the EU, the integrity of the single market is maintained.\u201d\n\nBut it was also good news for the British prime minister, who \u201ceven if he loses Saturday\u2019s vote he can go to the people arguing that he did what he said he would do, only to be stymied by parliament.\u201d\n\nFirst, though, would come Saturday, the Netherlands\u2019 De Volkskrant argued, reminding its readers of Lyndon B Johnson\u2019s first rule of politics: \u201cIts practitioners need to be able to count.\u201d That, the paper said, was most certainly going to apply to the late American president\u2019s British namesake over the coming few days.\n\n\u201cAlthough the DUP instantly rejected the deal on Thursday morning, Johnson says he is still confident of a parliamentary majority. He is betting that MPs scared of a no deal will prefer certainty to uncertainty. The biggest challenge will be in winning over enough Labour deputies. Johnson may hope that he is heading towards his finest hour. But the bookies reckon he\u2019s going to end up seven votes short.\u201d\n\nSpain\u2019s El Pais said the deal represented \u201cthe least bad exit for the immediate future\u201d. The UK would, as Angela Merkel said, \u201cbecome a rival \u2013 but not an enemy, as would have happened in case of a no-deal Brexit. Now, disagreements are going to be agreed \u2013 as long as MPs back the deal, which is not a given.\u201d\n\nThe EU, the paper said, \u201chas given nothing away with this modification of the withdrawal agreement. It had already offered these terms before; the other party rejected them.\u201d And at the very least, \u201ca no-deal, chaotic, economically disastrous and civically damaging outcome has been avoided for the EU citizens who reside on that unfortunate island.
