(MOEKETSI MAMANE)\n\nA waste picker was killed when he was run over by a compactor truck at the New England Road landfill on Monday.\n\nJames Stuward died on the scene after he slipped and fell when he and other waste pickers jumped on to the compactor.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, after he fell, Stuward tried to get up, however, the compactor driver who did not see him, reversed and accidentally ran him over.\n\nThe compactor truck belongs to a waste management company based in Mkondeni.\n\nWhen The Witness arrived at the dump, Stuward\u2019s body lay among the waste, under the hot sun. The body was covered and placed under a makeshift plastic tent while his relatives waited for a mortuary van to collect it.\n\nWhile some waste pickers gathered around the body, for others it was business as usual as they continued to scavenge through the rubbish for plastic, cardboard and other recyclables.\n\nStuward (29) hailed from Malawi. He had been working as a waste picker on the landfill site since his arrival in South Africa last June.\n\nHe lived at Cinderella Park with his child and girlfriend.\n\nHis cousin Jafere Maduka, also a waste picker, said he was at the bottom of the landfill site when he was informed that Stuward had been injured.\n\n\u201cWe walked together to work. We collected cardboard\u201a bottles and plastic containers\u201a\u201d said Maduka.\n\n\u201cEvery month we would go and sell to companies in town. It was not much but we paid rent and bought food. We were able to make R1 000\u201a depending on how much waste we collected. We sold our items once a month.\n\n\u201cMy heart is sore. I don\u2019t even know how I\u2019m going to break the news to his mother back home in Malawi. I came to South Africa 10 months ago through him; now that he\u2019s gone \u2026 I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to survive alone.\u201d\n\nMaduka described Stuward as a \u201cresponsible\u201d man who did not drink and smoke. \u201cThe only reason he was here was to be able to put food on the table for his family and also send money back home. He is also cautious around the compactor, I don\u2019t know what happened today. Some waste pickers would jump on to the compactor. He never did that. I don\u2019t understand how he was killed by this thing\u201a\u201d said Maduka.\n\nOne waste collector, who asked not to be identified, told The Witness that it was a harrowing sight.\n\n\u201cWe tried screaming for the driver to stop but it was already too late. I saw his body lying among the rubbish, but I was too scared to get close,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe always tell people not to jump on to vehicles because it\u2019s dangerous, but they never listen. Being here is dangerous but what can we do because we need the money.\u201d\n\nAn employee at the site said accidents due to negligence by some waste collectors at the site had become a daily occurrence.\n\n\u201cLast week when the mayor was here, we raised this concern. We need to have security guards patrolling here to make sure that people don\u2019t jump on to moving vehicles.\u201d\n\nPietermaritzburg police spokesperson Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese said a case of culpable homicide was opened at Alexandra Road police station.", "description": "A waste picker was killed when he was run over by a compactor truck at the New England Road landfill on Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9112/a86c09433e0a4ad9bbe3ce0057c262c4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-16"}
