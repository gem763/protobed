But when he\u2019s been healthy and free from off-course distractions, he\u2019s always found ways to win. And now, he\u2019s won as much as anybody on the PGA Tour.\n\nWoods completed a wire-to-wire victory at the Zozo Championship on Monday, equaling Sam Snead\u2019s PGA Tour record of 82 victories.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big number,\u201d Woods said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of consistency and doing it for a long period of time, Sam did it into his 50s and I\u2019m in my early to mid-40s, so it\u2019s about being consistent and doing it for a very long period of time. I\u2019ve been very fortunate to have the career I\u2019ve had so far.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

He\u2019s also had four back surgeries, including a spinal fusion, and looked at times as if his career was over, but he returned to win the Tour Championship in 2018 before his triumph at the Masters in April for his 15th major.\n\nThe Japan event was Woods\u2019 first start of his 23rd season on the PGA Tour.\n\n\u201cI can still manage my way around the golf course,\u201d Woods said. \u201cI know how to play. I was able to do that this week.\u201d\n\nThe fourth round was suspended because of darkness Sunday with Woods holding a three-stroke lead over Matsuyama in the first official PGA Tour event in Japan.\n\nHe bogeyed his first hole of the day, the par-4 12th, but was solid the rest of the way with birdies on Nos. 14 and 18 to finish at 19-under 261. Matsuyama also closed with a 67.\n\nWoods opened with consecutive 64s, with a day off in between because of rain. He had a 66 on Sunday in the third round.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long week,\u201d Woods said. \u201cFive days at the top of the leaderboard is a long time.\u201d\n\nAs the U.S. Presidents Cup captain, Woods was asked about picking himself for the team.\n\n\u201cI think the player got the captain\u2019s attention,\u201d Woods said.\n\nWoods\u2019 approach shot on the 12th found a greenside bunker. He blasted out and left himself a long par putt that he missed for bogey, cutting the lead to two strokes.\n\nBut that was the only time he would falter.\n\nMatsuyama missed a short birdie putt on the par-5 14th with a chance to cut the lead to a stroke. Woods, playing in the group behind Matsuyama, made birdie to restore the three-stroke lead.\n\nMatsuyama cut the lead to two with a birdie on par-3 16th. On the par-5 18th, he drove into a fairway bunker, and hit his approach into a greenside bunker before saving par.\n\nWoods\u2019 second shot on 18 also found a greenside bunker. He blasted to 10 feet and made the putt.\n\nWoods last played in an official tournament in Japan in 2006 at the Dunlop Phoenix, where he lost in a playoff to Padraig Harrington. He won the Dunlop Phoenix the two previous years.\n\nIt was a wild debut for the PGA in Japan. Torrential rain washed out play Friday, forcing the second round to be moved to Saturday. To make up for the lost day, the players started the fourth round immediately after finishing the third to get in as many holes as possible.\n\nThe course took on over 8 inches of rain Friday and was in remarkably good shape when play resumed on Saturday for the second round.\n\nWoods got in 11 holes and played 29 holes Sunday before having to come back for a 7:30 a.m. start.\n\n\u201cThis was certainly demanding,\u201d Woods said \u201cBeing in the lead for the better part of five days puts a stress on the mind. It\u2019s not easy to do. \u2026 It\u2019s stressful, it wears one out, but somehow I was able to finish out on top and made key putts this week.\u201d\n\nRory McIlroy, the highest-ranked player in the field, completed his round with two birdies for a 67 to tie for third at 13 under with Sungjae Im, who shot 65.\n\nAnd at the end of a long week of golf, Woods was still talking about consistency when asked if he could envision winning in his 50s like Snead did.\n\n\u201cAs far as playing until 52, I hope that\u2019s the case,\u201d Woods said. \u201cIf you would have asked me a few years ago, I would have given you a different answer, but certainly the future looks brighter than it has and hopefully I can be as consistent as he was well into my 40s and early 50s.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Woods completed a wire-to-wire victory at the Zozo Championship on Monday, equaling Sam Snead's PGA Tour record of 82 victories.", "authors": ["Jim Armstrong"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ap19301067710377.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
