First a woman played by Cecily Strong wearing a T-shirt reading \u201cKeem Amarica Greab Agrain,\u201d which she tells him \u201cwas taken verbatim from one of your tweets,\u201d and then a conspiracy theorist played by Aidy Bryant showed up, shouting, \u201cThe earth is coming for us! Beyonc\u00e9 is white!\u201d\n\nPete Davidson showed up as what seemed to be a young Trump supporter, later revealed to be a freed member of ISIS. \u201cI want to thank you for bringing jobs back... to ISIS,\u201d he says to Trump. \u201cI promise to make ISIS great again.\u201d\n\nKate McKinnon\u2019s Lindsey Graham was there, as was Alex Moffat\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg. \u201cHe got his ass owned by AOC, which means he\u2019s one of us now,\u201d Baldwin\u2019s Trump says, telling Zuck, \u201cI want to thank Facebook for running our Russian campaign for us.\u201d\n\nThe highlight for the studio audience, gauging by the applause of the crowd, was Darrell Hammond\u2019s return as Bill Clinton, itself a needed master class in how to keep a presidential impression fresh after many years, given who he was standing next to.\n\nWhen Baldwin\u2019s Trump tells Hammond\u2019s Clinton that he\u2019s getting impeached, Clinton\u2019s eyes deviously narrow. \u201cYou dirty dog\u2026\u201d he teases, before Trump interrupts: \u201cIt\u2019s not for that. They don\u2019t mind when I do that. Trust me.\u201d\n\nThe final guest was Fred Armisen surprising as Turkey\u2019s President Erdogan, who reassured Trump that \u201cwe\u2019re treating the Kurds really well.\u201d When Trump informs him that some generals\u2014\u201cor vagernals, as I call them, are mad that we pulled out of Syria\u201d\u2014Erdogan quips, \u201cUsually people are mad when you don\u2019t pull out!\u201d\n\nWith that, live from New York, it was Saturday Night.\n\n(Meanwhile, earlier this week on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK, of all series, possibly one of the best Trump impressions on any comedy show yet aired. It was as part of the \u201cSnatch Game\u201d episode, in which the show\u2019s drag queen contestants do celebrity impressions in a spoof of the classic game show, Match Game, performed by British drag performer The Vivienne. There\u2019s only a brief clip of it online, but trust that it was brilliant\u2014and certainly superior to this.)", "description": "The Trump rally cold open sketch also featured Pete Davidson as a member of ISIS and Fred Armisen\u2019s debut as the Turkish president, and digs at Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook.", "authors": ["Kevin Fallon", "Senior Entertainment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_768,w_1366,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572153101/Screenshot_742_oeiuay", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
