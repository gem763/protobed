Analysts were unusually upbeat, with JP Morgan declaring \u2018this changes everything\u2019 following the Prime Minister\u2019s promising talks with Irish premier Leo Varadkar.\n\nStock Watch - GYG Shares in superyacht painting and maintenance firm GYG surged after a big investor increased its stake. The company\u2019s share price rose by 8.3 per cent, or 4p, to 52.5p yesterday after Lombard Odier ramped up its holding to 22.6 per cent. In a stroke, it made the Swiss-based private bank GYG\u2019s biggest shareholder. Lombard\u2019s move came two weeks after GYG sailed into the black in its latest first-half results, recording a slight profit of around \u00a390,000.\n\nAnd with reports that British and EU negotiators will now enter \u2018the tunnel\u2019 \u2013 intense talks to hammer out an accord \u2013 Morgan Stanley went so far as to say the chances of a deal are more than 50 per cent.\n\nThe cheer swept through the stock market, lifting shares in retailers, housebuilders and other firms that have fortunes tied largely to the highs and lows of the economy.\n\nIt sent the international-focused FTSE 100 up 0.8 per cent, or 60.72 points to 7247.08, but the FTSE 250 index of mid-sized companies proved to be the star, surging 4.2 per cent, or 805.99 points, to 20,041.71, its highest level in three weeks.\n\nUnfortunately for some, however, it wasn\u2019t just the UK heading for the exit. Fund managers Jupiter Fund Management and Man Group revealed investors pulled more than \u00a32billion out in the three months to September, sending shares in the firms tumbling.\n\nJupiter fell 5.4 per cent, or 17.2p, to 335.2p after reporting net outflows of \u00a31.3billion.\n\nThe exodus came after one of its star stock pickers, Alexander Darwall, announced he was leaving to set up his own outfit.\n\nAnd Man Group also admitted investors had pulled about \u00a3870million, with shares falling 2.6 per cent, or 4.2p, to 157.95p after its trading update.\n\nGloom also struck advertising giant WPP. Shares in the firm, which is in the middle of a turnaround, were dragged down after French rival Publicis issued its second profit warning, triggering fears about the wider industry.\n\nAnalysts suggested some of the problems were actually specific to Publicis but the warning still triggered a sell-off of WPP\u2019s shares, causing them to fall 3.4 per cent, or 32.8p, to 931p.\n\nInvestors seemed less miffed by an update from Peppa Pig owner Entertainment One, however, despite the media company admitting its first quarter losses had widened from \u00a36.8million to \u00a343.9million.\n\nIn an update on the three months to June, the firm blamed rising debts, its takeover of Audio Network and lower sales in its film, television and music division.\n\nThe embarrassing performance comes less than a week before game maker Hasbro puts its \u00a33.3billion takeover of the company to a shareholder vote. Shares remained static at 562.5p.\n\nHaving endured a brutal month after it pulled a \u00a3394.8million bond sale in September, potash miner Sirius Minerals\u2019 shares rallied 5.8 per cent, or 0.2p to 3.63p after it sealed a supply and distribution deal with state-owned Qatari firm, Muntajat.", "description": "Jet2 owner Dart Group reported 'encouraging levels' of late-season bookings, prompting it to predict its profits would be higher than expected.
