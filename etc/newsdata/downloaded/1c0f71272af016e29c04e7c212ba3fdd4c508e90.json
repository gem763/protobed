The Fed said purchases of Treasury bills will extend \u201cat least into the second quarter of next year,\u201d leaving open the possibility of a change in the pace and duration of purchases.\n\nA recent and unexpected scarcity of lenders in overnight funding markets caused yields to spike sharply in mid-September, briefly pushing the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate outside its target range. Since then, the Fed has been injecting liquidity into overnight markets on an ad hoc basis. The central bank said Friday that these would continue at least through January.\n\nThe Fed said the aim of the bill purchases would be to maintain bank reserves in the system \u201cat or above the level that prevailed in early September 2019.\u201d\n\n\u2018Certainly Help\u2019\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if this is going to be enough, but this will certainly help,\u201d said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis. \u201cIt will paper over some of the remaining technical issues that still need to be fixed.\u201d\n\nThe central bank said Friday that policy makers held a videoconference on Oct. 4 to discuss the moves.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee is next scheduled to meet on Oct. 29-30 to discuss monetary policy amid expectations it could cut interest rates for the third time this year to further protect the economy from global weakness and trade uncertainty.\n\n\u201cFrom a monetary policy standpoint, I\u2019d say that at the margin it means they can focus on whether to cut or not cut at the next meeting, and not be bothered with the discussion about the plumbing,\u201d said Thomas Costerg, senior economist at Pictet Wealth Management.\n\nBy purchasing securities, the Fed will add a cushion to the supply of excess bank reserves, a pool of money that helps provide liquidity to the overnight market.\n\nOvernight money markets -- where banks, investment funds, companies and other institutions borrow and lend cash -- help set the baseline costs for longer-term lending. The Fed seeks to control overnight rates as a tool for influencing the broader economy.\n\nThe Fed said it will also continue to inject liquidity into the markets through overnight and term repurchase agreements. Term repo operations \u201cwill generally be conducted twice per week, initially in an offering amount of at least $35 billion per operation,\u201d the Fed said. \u201cOvernight repo operations will be conducted daily, initially in an offering amount of at least $75 billion per operation.\u201d\n\nUntil recently, the Fed was reducing the size of its balance sheet, unwinding some of the crises-era bond purchases in a process that lowered the supply of excess reserves. Fed officials had readily admitted they didn\u2019t know how far that process could go before it might cause a shortage of reserves and disrupt money markets, but they anticipated that threshold would be lower than they now believe.\n\n\u201cIt very much looked like we were still a bit perhaps above that\u201d threshold, Powell said in Denver. \u201cUntil September, when we found we probably weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFor the week through Sept. 4, bank reserves deposited at the Fed totaled $1.49 trillion, according to data from the central bank. That fell to $1.39 trillion on Sept. 18 before bouncing back to $1.51 trillion in data reported Oct. 10.\n\n(Updates with economist\u2019s comment in seventh paragraph, additional details.)\n\n--With assistance from Vivien Lou Chen and Sophie Caronello.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Rich Miller in Washington at rmiller28@bloomberg.net;Christopher Condon in Washington at ccondon4@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alister Bull at abull7@bloomberg.net, Scott Lanman\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Explore what\u2019s moving the global economy in the new season of the Stephanomics podcast.
