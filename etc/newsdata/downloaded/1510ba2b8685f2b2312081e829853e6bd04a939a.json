ACCC explains that consumers would have assumed simply switching the Location History setting off would have assumed Google was no longer collecting their location information.\n\nFor that to happen during that time between 2017 and 2018, however, Web & App Activity would have also needed to be switched off.\n\nImage: ACCC\n\nImage: ACCC\n\nA Google spokesperson told Gizmodo Australia it plans to defend the ACCC's allegations.\n\n\"We are currently reviewing the details of these allegations. We continue to engage with the ACCC and intend to defend this matter,\" the spokesperson told us.\n\nThe Shadow Minister for Communication, Michelle Rowland, said in response to the ACCC's allegations that it's in everyone's interest to make informed choices about how their data is collected and used.\n\n\"The average person would be astounded at the level and range of data digital platforms like Google have about them,\" MP Rowland said in a media release.\n\n\"It's up to the ACCC to use the laws at its disposal to ensure consumers are protected, particularly in this day and age when we carry the internet around with us on our mobile phones and smart watches. Mobile towers, Wi-Fi hotspots and apps like Google Maps bring great convenience to our lives. Let\u2019s not kid ourselves, they also track our location and interactions, and this data is being monetised.\"\n\nThe ACCC is hoping to seek penalties, declarations and orders requiring the publication of corrective notices and the establishment of a compliance program from Google if successful in trial.", "description": "The ACCC has began proceedings against Google alleging it had misled Australian customers over the data Google collects, keeps and uses....", "authors": ["Sarah Basford", "Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/g/2019/10/googlegsign.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
