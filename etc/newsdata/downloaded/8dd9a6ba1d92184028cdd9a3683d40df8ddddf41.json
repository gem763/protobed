Senate Democrats invited the mayor of Dayton, Ohio, Nan Whaley, to address their own lunch to discuss the Aug. 4 shooting in her city that left nine with fatal wounds in less than a minute. Outside the Capitol, Whaley and other leaders of cities touched by recent mass shootings \u2014 such as Pittsburgh and Annapolis, Md. \u2014 rallied with gun-control advocates for congressional action.\n\n[Democrats press Trump, GOP to tighten gun controls after Odessa mass shooting]\n\nThe party\u2019s congressional leaders told their Republican counterparts that it was not acceptable to wait for Trump, who has constantly shifted his position on remedying gun violence, to decide what he wants.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say there\u2019s one word that describes Mitch McConnell\u2019s attitude on this vital issue of life and death, and that is: Duck,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). \u201cHe\u2019s afraid of this issue, but that\u2019s not what a leader should be doing.\u201d\n\nIn the Democratic-majority House, a committee prepared to advance a trio of gun-control bills Tuesday, setting up floor votes on measures that go beyond the expansion of federal gun-buyer background checks that Democrats have focused on for years. The move reflects growing impatience in the party as they wait for Republicans to move forward on expanding background checks.\n\nOne measure would encourage states to set up \u201cred flag\u201d laws that would allow law enforcement agencies to ask a judge to remove weapons from people found to be a danger to themselves or others, while another, sponsored by Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.), would institute a federal ban on ammunition magazines of more than 10 rounds. A third, from Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.), would add misdemeanor hate crimes to the list of offenses making an individual ineligible to buy a gun.\n\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said the bills were intended to \u201crespond to the daily toll of gun violence in our communities, whether they are mass shootings or not, and whether or not they make national headlines.\u201d\n\nBut Rep. Douglas A. Collins (R-Ga.), the top Republican on the panel, said the bills would undermine gun owners\u2019 Second Amendment rights, and he pointed to \u201cserious due process problems\u201d with the red-flag bill.\n\n\u201cI stand ready to work with you on sensible solutions that actually could prevent these atrocities,\u201d he told Nadler. \u201cWhat I am not willing to do is support legislation that will not do anything to make us safer and simultaneously infringes on the rights and liberties guaranteed by our Constitution.\u201d\n\n[Back in Washington, Democrats press Trump, McConnell for action on guns]\n\nAsked about gun legislation Monday, Trump declined to say when he might roll out a proposal. \u201cWe are talking about a lot of different things,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, we have to protect our Second Amendment very strongly, and we will always do that.\u201d\n\nA Republican aide said Trump could be presented with options on guns as soon as Wednesday but said there was no firm timeline for formally presenting a package to Congress. House Republicans are heading to Baltimore for their annual policy retreat Thursday, where they will hear directly from Trump. A House GOP aide said it is unknown whether Trump will use the speech to discuss his preferred response to the shootings.\n\nRep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.), a co-chairman of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, said Trump would be well served to \u201cfocus on the \u2018who\u2019 solutions, not the \u2018what\u2019 solutions\u201d \u2014 meaning laws that focus on who can get guns, not what type of guns they can get.\n\nReed said he was as eager as everyone else on Capitol Hill to hear what Trump might propose: \u201cI don\u2019t want to engage in politics and theater. I want to get something done, and so what will actually get signed into law is something we\u2019re very interested in knowing.\u201d\n\nSen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.), who has previously worked with Democrats on gun legislation, told reporters he had spoken to Trump a half-dozen times about possible responses to the string of mass shootings with a focus on background checks.\n\nToomey crafted a background-check expansion proposal in 2013 with Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) in the months after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn., that ultimately failed to get the 60 votes needed to pass the Senate. That legislation did not go as far as the pending House-passed bill in covering a wider variety of gun transactions, and it is unclear if Trump will support something that goes as far as the 2013 language did.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been asking thoughtful, reasonable questions all along the way and exhibiting to me a real interest in accomplishing something, but I don\u2019t think it was ever well-defined in terms of a policy prescription,\u201d Toomey said. \u201cI think that\u2019s where he\u2019s trying to get to.\u201d\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who spent much of Monday traveling with Trump to and from a North Carolina rally, said that he still sees \u201ca pretty good chance\u201d of combining legislation that would encourage states to adopt \u201cred flag\u201d laws with a background-checks bill that he described as a \u201cmodified\u201d version of the Manchin-Toomey bill.\n\nToomey said some Republican senators are \u201crethinking\u201d their prior votes against his legislation. \u201cSupport from the president is going to be essential,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with that support, I really think we could get to the 60 votes we need.\u201d\n\nSeung Min Kim contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "White House aides briefed Republican senators on potential legislative options but gave no indication of what the president is willing to sign into law.", "authors": ["Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives", "Paul Kane", "Senior Congressional Correspondent", "September At Pm", "Mike Debonis Covers Congress", "With A Focus On The House", "For The Washington Post.
