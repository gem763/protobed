Wednesday's decision may require fine-tuning of that list.\n\nThe dispute over aerospace subsidies has expanded into other products and the WTO ruling opens the door to tariffs on French wine. (Balint Porneczi/Bloomberg)\n\nSuch tariffs can take effect no earlier than mid-October because a key WTO panel needs to formally sign off on them first. But they will likely have an impact on key agricultural and other sectors of the European economy, at a time when other tariff battles have dented global trade growth.\n\nThe EU's top trade official responded to the announcement by saying the bloc would prefer to reach a settlement with the United States to avoid a tariff war \u2014 but it will respond if President Donald Trump imposes new duties on EU products.\n\nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said a tariff war \"would only inflict damage on businesses and citizens on both sides of the Atlantic, and harm global trade and the broader aviation industry at a sensitive time.\"\n\n\"If the U.S. decides to impose WTO authorized countermeasures, it will be pushing the EU into a situation where we will have no other option than to do the same,\" she said.\n\nThe arbitration award is the largest among about two dozen at the WTO since it was created nearly 25 years ago. The previous record award of $4 billion was in 2002, when the WTO ruled against the U.S. over the Foreign Sales Corporation law that allowed for illegal subsidies to some U.S. businesses.\n\n'If the U.S. decides to impose WTO authorized countermeasures, it will be pushing the EU into a situation where we will have no other option than to do the same,' Cecilia Malmstrom said. (Eric Vidal/Reuters)\n\nUnlike the Trump administration's unilateral tariffs on billions of dollars-worth of steel, aluminum and other goods from China, the EU and elsewhere, the retaliatory tariffs authorized in the Airbus case enjoy a stamp of approval from the WTO \u2014 an organization that Trump has repeatedly criticized.\n\nA May 2018 WTO ruling found that EU \"launch aid\" for Airbus had resulted in lost sales for Boeing in the twin-aisle and very-large-aircraft markets. The ruling centred on two aircraft: Airbus's 350XWB \u2014 a rival of Boeing's 787 \u2014 and the double-decker A380, which surpassed the Boeing 747 as the world's largest commercial passenger plane.\n\nDispute goes back to 2004\n\nThe case itself dates to 2004, a testament to the plodding and thorough rhythm of the Geneva-based trade body.\n\nThe Trump administration has been demanding reform of the WTO, and has been blocking new appointments to its crucial Appellate Body \u2014 which could be rendered inactive in December unless the U.S. gets its way.\n\nThe WTO is already examining a dozen cases involving U.S. tariffs and countermeasures brought by its trading partners over the administration's steel and aluminum tariffs. Trump has insisted the move is needed to protect U.S. national security interests, but the Europeans claim it is simply protectionism and breaks global trade rules.\n\nThe EU introduced \"rebalancing\" tariffs on about $3 billion US worth of steel, agricultural and other products. Trump has also threatened to slap duties on European automakers.", "description": "A World Trade Association decision Wednesday gives the United States the all clear to slap tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of products such as wine, cheese and olives in retaliation for subsidies that various EU nations give to plane maker Airbus.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5305679.1570026470!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/france-wine.jpg"}
