We totally condemn such conduct, and those who engage in such conduct don\u2019t deserve to be called teachers.\u201d\n\nRAMAPHOSA WARNS TEACHERS AGAINST HAVING SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH LEARNERS\n\nWhile addressing the national congress of Sadtu in September, President Cyril Ramaphosa urged teachers to stop initiating romantic and sexual relationships with pupils.\n\nThe South African schooling system is facing a massive challenge of teenage pregnancy, with experts saying adults, including teachers, are to blame for the problem.\n\nRamaphosa said Sadtu, which is the majority union in the education sector, should work with other stakeholders to put a stop to this.\n\n\u201cThis abhorrent behaviour must be decisively addressed, and it must be stopped. As educators, your job is that of a parent to the children who come to the school, you\u2019re not supposed to be lovers of those children.\u201d\n\nIn South Africa the age of sexual consent is 16 years and sexual activity below that is considered as statutory rape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post Those Having Sexual Relations With Learners Don\u2019t Deserve To Be Teachers appeared first on iAfrica.com.", "description": "Those Having Sexual Relations With Learners Don\u2019t Deserve To Be Teachers", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/World_News_10_800x533_L_1420026292.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
