Families were to be moved later.\n\nNorthern France has long been a magnet for people seeking to smuggle themselves to Britain in the tens of thousands of trucks and cars that travel daily between the countries on ferries and trains.\n\nThe area around Grande-Synthe has traditionally drawn Iraqi Kurds and has been repeatedly cleared in recent years.\n\nA court in the regional city of Lille ordered the gymnasium shut on 4 September after complaints from local authorities and residents about violence, rubbish and the presence of people-smugglers among the migrants.\n\nFrench authorities have had a policy of trying to prevent migrants forming camps since 2016 when they razed an illegal camp nicknamed the \u201cJungle\u201d near the port of Calais, which was home to 10,000 people at its height.\n\nBut rights groups have criticised police tactics, and migrants have begun taking even greater risks to try to reach Britain, including trying to cross the Channel, the world\u2019s busiest shipping lane, in small boats.\n\nIn December, the French human rights ombudsman denounced the \u201cextreme destitution\u201d suffered by people camping out or sleeping under bridges in the Calais area.\n\nThe ombudsman, Jacques Toubon, accused the authorities of trying to make migrants \u201cinvisible\u201d by regularly tearing down their camps without providing them with viable alternatives.\n\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, has pledged to speed up the asylum claims process for people deemed to be bona fide refugees, while vowing to accelerate the deportation of so-called economic migrants.\n\nOn Monday, he told his ministers that the government needed to tackle the issue of immigration head-on, warning: \u201cBy claiming to be humanist, sometimes we are too laxist.\u201d", "description": "About 1,000 people removed from site near Dunkirk after court orders its closure", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse In Grande-Synthe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98fc6c9d8b911f3cafd8a5a265ecaa7834c9d809/0_47_2693_1616/master/2693.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1f2962e108eef815d059a7d4e1bf0ab0", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
