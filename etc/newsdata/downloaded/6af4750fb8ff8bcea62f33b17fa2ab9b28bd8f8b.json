President Wallace D. Loh, dated Sept. 26, said U.S. officials are \u201cconcerned\u201d that what the university has reported \u201cmay not fully capture\u201d all the gifts and contracts that bring revenue from foreign sources to the public flagship school and affiliated institutions in College Park.\n\nAD\n\nThe letter requested that U-Md. provide records on foreign gifts and contracts from recent years, highlighting gifts or contracts connected to China, Qatar, Russia and certain business and education entities from those countries.\n\nAD\n\nThe letter resembles others the department sent over the summer to Texas A&M, Cornell, Rutgers and Georgetown universities, a sign the Trump administration is stepping up scrutiny of foreign ties to prominent schools.\n\nThe Education Department did not immediately reply Wednesday to a request for comment about the letter to U-Md.\n\nThe university\u2019s senior vice president and provost, Mary Ann Rankin, notified senior U-Md. officials Tuesday about the federal inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nU-Md. spokeswoman Katie Lawson said the university is seeking to answer federal questions.\n\n\u201cOnce the university learned that we were not reporting this information, we worked quickly to come into compliance,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cWe join other universities in addressing this issue. We have been in compliance since January 2019, which was the next reporting deadline after we discovered we were not in compliance. We plan to work with federal officials in a transparent and timely manner to fully resolve these issues.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLawson said no further information about foreign revenue to U-Md. was immediately available.\n\nThe American Council on Education, which represents college and university presidents, said some schools have voiced confusion about the federal queries. \u201cThere just hasn\u2019t been clarity on what should be reported and how it should be reported,\u201d said Sarah Spreitzer, the council\u2019s director of government and public affairs.\n\nAD\n\nGeorgetown said Wednesday that it worked with the department after receiving the inquiry.\n\n\u201cGeorgetown University is a globally oriented institution that has many internationally focused academic programs and engagements,\u201d the university said in a statement. \u201cGeorgetown takes seriously its reporting obligations and regularly provides all information as required by the Department of Education.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA federal website shows that Georgetown received $415 million from foreign sources from 2012 through 2018, most of it connected to its campus in Qatar and related activities in the country.\n\nThe website did not show any foreign funding for U-Md.\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news\n\nAD", "description": "Education Department asks university for records, citing disclosure requirement.", "authors": ["Nick Anderson", "Reporter Covering Higher Education", "National Education Policy", "The Global Education Market"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zdbUl-cbWotjL9CdEWRdXIgWtEk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KWGZK3W3UQI6PISBBBEDCVSC2A.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
