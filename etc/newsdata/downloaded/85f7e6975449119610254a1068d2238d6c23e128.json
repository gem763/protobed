The trip came as a hastily brokered five-day cease-fire in Syria was struggling to take hold entering its third day.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPelosi had earlier called the cease-fire deal \u201ca sham\u201d that gave a pass to Turkey\u2019s offensive at the expense of the Kurds, a key ally in the recent fight against the Islamic State in Syria. Coverage of Pelosi\u2019s \u201cmiddle of the night\u201d meetings in the Jordanian press focused largely on concerns that Turkey\u2019s assault will result in the release of thousands of Islamic State fighters, many of them from Jordan, from Syrian prisons.\n\n\u201cThis visit comes at a crucial time of threats to stability in the region and the control of Isis,\u201d said the daily paper Al Ghad.\n\nPelosi has been harshly critical of Trump\u2019s move in Syria, which was greeted with dismay by governments throughout the region. Israeli security experts called it a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of the Kurds, and many saw Pelosi\u2019s sudden appearance in Amman as a globe-hopping slap at the president.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it matters what they talked about, what matters is that she came here to draw a line under his abandonment of the Kurds and the outrage it has caused,\u201d said a former Israeli general, who asked not to be named because of his ties to the military.\n\nCongressional visits, especially to conflict zones, are often kept secret for security reasons. The trips by congressional delegations, known in Washington as codels, have been known to create political waves.\n\nPelosi has made other international stops that underscored her differences with Trump, including a visit to the Irish border to decry possible damage to the country from Brexit, which the president has supported enthusiastically. In January, during the government shutdown, Trump revoked the speaker\u2019s access to a military plane just as her delegation was preparing to depart for Afghanistan.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Jordan, the state-run Petra news said Abdullah thanked the speaker for making the trip and for Congress\u2019s long-standing support of his country. He \u201curged a political solution that safeguards Syria\u2019s territorial integrity and the unity of its people, while guaranteeing the safe and voluntary return of refugees.\u201d\n\nTrump has faced a rare bipartisan backlash for his Syria move, and one Republican lawmaker, Mac Thornberry, traveled with Pelosi to Jordan. Thornberry (Tex.), a member of the House Armed Services Committee, announced in September that he would retire at the end of his term.\n\nThe other members of the nine-person delegation included Rep. Susan A. Davis (D-Calif.), a member of the Armed Services Committee; Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.); and Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the head of the Intelligence Committee who is leading the impeachment inquiry against the president.\n\nCongress is expected to vote on proposed sanctions against Turkey in coming days.\n\nThis article has been corrected to convey that Rep. Susan A. Davis (D-Calif.) is a member, not the chairwoman, of the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nAD", "description": "The House speaker met with Jordan\u2019s leaders to discuss refugees and \u2018regional stability.\u2019", "authors": ["Steve Hendrix", "Jerusalem Bureau Chief Steve Hendrix Has Written For Foreign", "National", "Local", "Most Other Sections Of The Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xu3BoA_GVo8zYQzv6Ex_pw2dXTY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6SG4WMXQ6MI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
