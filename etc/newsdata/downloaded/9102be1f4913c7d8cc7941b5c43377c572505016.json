My advice on modern masculinity would be to look at all those traits you believe are feminine and interrogate why you are so obsessed with being the opposite. Because this idea that to be a man you have to be the furthest away from being a woman that you possibly can is really weird.\n\nWhy is everyone so scared of not being masculine? If you consider many of those in power, those who claim to be \u201cleading\u201d the world at the moment, you've got a lot of hypermasculine man-babies, with terrible hair and no ability to compromise. These are the cool guys who are taking us all to hell in a handbasket they didn't pay for.\n\nSo here's a thought experiment: What if you, the men, looked to traditional feminine traits and tried incorporating them into your masculinity?\n\nWomen are always being encouraged to stir masculine traits into their feminine recipe. We are told to \u201cbe bolder!\u201d \u201cSpeak up in meetings.\u201d \u201cExaggerate your skills.\u201d All that Lean In sort of crap. So perhaps it's time for you, the men, to be more ladylike. How about you scale back on your confidence? How about you try not to act in every situation? What if you tried to refrain from sharing your opinions or co-opting other people's ideas? How about yielding to people walking in the opposite direction? Or even just attempting to see them?\n\nHow about you try pretending that you're the least powerful person in any room, and that no matter how hard you work you'll never be the most powerful. Walk around like that for a couple weeks. And then call your mother.\n\nThis is the first time that straight white cis men have been forced to think of themselves as anything other than human neutral. And that must be a difficult thing. And I don't say that to be sarcastic. I can see how it is a tough spot. It is not your fault. You didn't build this mess. You were born into it, like the rest of us. What I am saying is, I have empathy for you. And empathy, by the way, is one of the traits that women are most famous for. You might know it by its other name: \u201cweakness.\u201d But don't be fooled\u2014empathy is a superpower, and it's the only one that any human has to offer.\u2014As told to Nora Caplan-Bricker\n\nAmy Sussman/Getty Images\n\nEJ Johnson on\u2026The Joys of the Male Beauty Movement\n\nEJ Johnson is a television personality who, by embracing traditionally feminine clothing and cosmetics, is helping broaden mainstream ideas about style.\n\nGQ: Your father, Magic Johnson, represents a kind of traditional masculinity. How did you navigate your own ideas while having him as a dad?\n\nEJ Johnson: I always knew that I was never going to be that type of man in that hypermasculine type of world. That was never going to be the tea for me. My dad is an incredible man, though, and the fact that he put all the comments and judgments aside to be like, I'm going to let this kid be free because I love him\u2014that's the greatest gift he ever gave me.\n\nWhat's the biggest change in the way we talk about male beauty today?\n\nWhen I started experimenting, in 2010, it wasn't talked about. It's cool to see it become less stigmatized. I've always had an affinity for expressing myself in feminine ways. When I was growing up, it was something I was told to hide. Now I'm a much happier person, and more successful, when I'm expressing myself with my feminine energy.", "description": "Jaboukie Young-White, Hannah Gadsby, Asia Kate Dillon, and more explore how masculinity is morphing and modernizing, in their own words.", "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Nora Caplan-Bricke", "Nora Caplan-Bricker"], "top_image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5da4cccf9ea117000848d19d/16:9/w_2560,c_limit/new-masculinity-gq-november-2019-lede-16x9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
