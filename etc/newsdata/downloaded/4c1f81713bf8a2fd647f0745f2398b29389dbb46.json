FIFA can then enforce such bans at a worldwide level.\u201d\n\nEngland fans show their support in the stands during the UEFA Euro 2020 Qualifying match at the Vasil Levski National Stadium (Nick Potts/PA)\n\nFollowing UEFA\u2019s anti-racism protocols, an announcement was made in the 28th minute of the match warning fans that any further incidents of racist abuse could result in it being abandoned, while another pause before half-time only added to the nasty spectacle.\n\nA three-step protocol from the governing body would have allowed the officials to take the teams off for a break in play as a second measure before ultimately taking the final step of abandoning the game.\n\nInfantino, who during his time at UEFA introduced that protocol, added: \u201cWhen we proposed the three-step procedure in 2009 when I was at UEFA, and then made the regulations even tougher a few years later, we could not have imagined that so shortly thereafter we would again be having to think of how to combat this obnoxious disease that seems to be getting even worse in some parts of the world.\u201d\n\nUEFA President Aleksander \u010ceferin underlines the commitment of European football\u2019s governing body to tackle racism... \u2014 UEFA (@UEFA) October 15, 2019\n\nThe cases against the BFU and FA will be dealt with by UEFA\u2019s control, ethics and disciplinary body, with the date of the meeting yet to be confirmed. FIFA said it would extend any sanctions worldwide.\n\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate felt his players and staff made a \u201cbigger statement than any team ever has done within international football\u201d with their actions in Sofia.\n\nThe group decided to finish the match during a half-time discussion, but 10 minutes before the break he spoke to assistant Steve Holland about the likelihood of the match being called off given the racist abuse inside the Vasil Levski National Stadium.\n\nAsked about what should be done in terms of punishment, Southgate said: \u201cI really think other people have got to deal with that.\n\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate, third right, hailed the way his players dealt with the racist abuse (Nick Potts/PA)\n\n\u201cWith respect, the amount I\u2019ve had to deal with is remarkable. And other people are in positions to be able to affect that.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t give you what would be the right answer for that. So, I think clearly it has got to be dealt with differently.\n\n\u201cThe sad reality is that we weren\u2019t able to stop incidents happening, and so now something clearly within the investigation has got to take that next step with regard to that, because it\u2019s remarkable to have such a spotlight on a game and for that all to happen.\n\n\u201cBut sadly, from a societal perspective, that seems to be what we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d\n\nUEFA president Aleksander Ceferin urged the \u201cfootball family\u201d to \u201cwage war on the racists\u201d.\n\nUEFA president Aleksander Ceferin called for a tough stance on racism in the game (Niall Carson/PA)\n\nCeferin blamed a \u201crise in nationalism\u201d across Europe for fuelling racism at matches and said football had become \u201ccomplacent\u201d in tackling the problem.\n\nThe Slovenian added that UEFA has some of the toughest sanctions in sport in dealing with racist supporters and feels criticism of the governing body\u2019s handling of the issue is unfair.\n\n\u201cAs a governing body, I know we are not going to win any popularity contests. But some of the views expressed about UEFA\u2019s approach to fighting racism have been a long way off the mark,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cUEFA\u2019s sanctions are among the toughest in sport for clubs and associations whose supporters are racist at our matches.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that UEFA was the only football body to ban a player for 10 matches for racist behaviour, the most severe punishment in the game.", "description": "England\u00b4s Euro 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria in Sofia was stopped twice as Bulgarian fans made Nazi salutes and racially abused players.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/04/wire-19770866-1571197131-286_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
