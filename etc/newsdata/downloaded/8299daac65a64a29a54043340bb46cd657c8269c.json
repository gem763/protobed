I know a lot of Winnipeggers haven't either,\" he added.\n\nBowman added all city-run recreation centres and libraries are closed and will re-open again on Sunday. Garbage and yard waste collection was delayed in some cases due to downed trees.\n\nBlowing snow took down this big tree on Balmoral Street overnight Thursday in Winnipeg\u2019s West Broadway neighbourhood. (Bryce Hoye/CBC)\n\nThe city said the Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service responded to 870 calls for problems related to hydro lines, including three structure fires.\n\nA near miss happened in Crescentwood when a transformer exploded earlier Saturday morning.\n\n'It was like fireworks'\n\nRussell Enns woke up to some strange sounds.\n\n\"All of a sudden there were sparks. It was like fireworks, to be quite honest with you,\" he told CBC News.\n\n\"It sounded just like it was New Years Eve or Canada Day celebrations.\"\n\nRussell Enns woke up to hear a transformer explode in the lane behind his Wellington Crescent home. (Austin Grabish/CBC)\n\nManitoba Hydro says it's working around the clock to restore power to homes throughout the province.\n\nBruce Owen, a spokesperson for Manitoba Hydro, speaking to CBC's Nadia Kidwai on Weekend Morning on Saturday, said more than 48,000 households province-wide are experiencing power outages as of 7 a.m. By 11 a.m., just under 53,000 households were affected.\n\n\"This storm system has lingered a number of days and it has caused ongoing problems,\" he said. \"As soon as we fix one thing, boom, two to three things more break because this storm just won't let up.\"\n\nThe storm system moved on from Winnipeg overnight, and so did crews. But Owen said utility crews had to be pulled off the roads in the Portage la Prairie and Neepawa areas because of near-blizzard conditions.\n\nHydro crews need roads cleared\n\nOwen said the majority of residents in Portage la Prairie are still left in the dark. He expects the crews to be back up and running as soon as they're able to drive where they need to go.\n\nMayor of Portage la Prairie Irvine Ferris told CBC News the entire city is without power after the storm.\n\n\"A couple of our towers are down and there are a lot of other issues,\" he said.\n\nCrews have been working through the night to remove trees from priority routes and to keep roads open for emergency vehicles and essential services. We encourage people to stay home and stay off the roads today. We will continue to update through the day. \u2014@CityofPortage\n\nManitoba Hydro said in a release on Saturday afternoon that crews are facing issues diagnosing the problems.\n\n\"We are having trouble even accessing those lines to locate the problems. Consequently, without power feeding those substations, we have large blocks of customers without electricity,\" said Scott Powell, a spokesperson.\n\nOn Friday, Manitoba Hydro tweeted it wouldn't be able to provide estimated times for power restoration. That was still the case on Saturday.\n\nOwen said timing depends on each scenario, including whether there's damage to a power line, whether a tree is involved, and on weather and road conditions.\n\nHe said Manitoba Hydro and the contracted crews prioritize certain areas first.\n\nTrees weighed down by wet, heavy snow have fallen in the city, including in Winnipeg's Wildwood neighbourhood. (Jeff Stapleton/CBC)\n\n\"We try to restore the greatest number of people first,\" he said. \"People in more isolated areas, smaller outages, we will get to them next.\"\n\nAt the height in Winnipeg, 27,000 households were without power. Owen said that number is now down to about 7,000.\n\nThe storm arrived so early this fall that most trees are still loaded with leaves, which are now supporting the snow and causing the branches to bear more weight than normal.\n\n\"And they are coming down on our [power] lines,\" said Owen, urging the public to be careful.\n\nLane Gibson sent this photo to CBC of an oak tree that fell onto his home on Winnipeg's Kingston Crescent. (Submitted by Lane Gibson)\n\nHeavy damage to trees\n\nMatt Vinet, a manager at Green Drop, one of the yard maintenance companies contracted to do the work, called the situation \"a tree apocalypse\" on Friday.\n\n\"I don't mean to be so alarmist, but it looks pretty grim at this point,\" he said. \"We're going to see a lot of damage to a lot of trees.\"\n\nThe city said in a release Saturday it received nearly 2,000 calls about fallen trees and branches. About 50 crews are working to clear and remove them across the city.\n\nBowman said crews are doing their best to clean up the city.\n\n\"I know all of us would like to have all of the power restored immediately; we'd like to have the streets clear, we'd like to have the trees removed immediately, but we do need to be patient with crews that are out there, he said.\n\nWatch: Manitoba's early snowstorm brings down trees with leaves still attached\n\nResidents reeling after wet dump of snow takes down power lines, snaps trees like twigs. 1:47\n\nA number of highways in the southwest are still closed due to weather conditions.\n\nHighway closures\n\nDozens of highways and roads throughout southern Manitoba to the U.S. border and the Saskatchewan border are closed to traffic due to poor winter driving conditions.\n\nIt's not known when they will reopen.\n\nSome highways have been closed for over 24 hours.\n\nHighway 75 from the U.S. border to Winnipeg is closed due to road conditions. (Walther Bernal/CBC)\n\nThe Manitoba government said it continues to monitor the severe weather and supply of electricity, as well as rivers, lakes and streams in the region as water levels continue to rise.\n\nAs residents and neighbours chip away at the damage and clear debris, hundreds of provincial, municipal and utilities workers are working to fix issues.\n\nSome grocery retailers had bare fridge and store shelves on Saturday due to shipments that have yet to arrive at their Manitoba destinations.\n\nRoad closures prevented grocery stores from receiving shipments of milk, produce and some other items at Winnipeg supermarkets such as Superstore. (CBC)\n\nAs highway and road closures are getting lifted across the province, Manitoba Hydro said that non-essential road traffic continues to hinder their efforts.\n\n\"So if you don't have to travel, if you don't have to go anywhere, please stay put,\" Owen said.", "description": "Manitoba Hydro says it's working around the clock to restore power after a snowstorm walloped the southern\u00a0half of the province over the last two days.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5319500.1570901295!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/snow-storm-winnipeg.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
