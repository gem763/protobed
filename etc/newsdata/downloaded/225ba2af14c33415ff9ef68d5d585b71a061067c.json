That challenge could also be reviewed further, though Wilson did appear to initially make contact with Hooley\u2019s leg and the American\u2019s foot did seem to be on the turf at the time of the impact.\n\nStory continues\n\nA third incident in a controversial match saw USA flanker John Quill shown a red card for a disgraceful challenge on Owen Farrell. The England replacement knocked the ball on when trying to break from their own 22 after a quick penalty when Quill levelled him out of frustration, leading with the shoulder in Farrell\u2019s face and not making any attempt to wrap the arm. To make matters worse, Berry had already blown his whistle to bring play back for the knock-on, and it left the England captain with a nasty cut to his nose.\n\n\u201cI think someone is going to BBQ part of his nose,\u201d laughed Jones afterwards. \u201cHe\u2019s missing part of his nose, which is unfortunate. But he\u2019s married, he\u2019s got a child and he\u2019s not looking for any young lass in Kobe tonight so he\u2019ll be ok.\u201d\n\nUSA boss Gary Gold was much angrier with the challenge though, and tore into his team for their poor showing as well as Quill for his needless challenge on Farrell in what was their opening game of the World Cup.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure they could make it any clearer: You are not allowed to make contact with the head and you have to use your arms and he did not do that,\u201d Gold said of Quill\u2019s red card.\u201d \u201cIt is what it is. Unfortunately we have to suffer the consequences.\n\n\u201cI am proud that the guys did not roll over. It is just a fantastic group of guys who want to work very hard, but we lost every single aspect of the game, we lost the collisions, we lost the set piece, we lost defensively and most importantly we lost the kicking game.\n\n\u201cIt is pretty sombre. We\u2019re disappointed, we feel we let ourselves down badly today.\u201d\n\nOwen Farrell needed treatment to a cut on his nose after the tackle (Getty)\n\nOverall, England sit pretty at the top of Pool C and will do regardless of what France do against the Eagles on Wednesday, given that England do not play again until their meeting with Argentina a week on Saturday. With 10 points from a possible 10 and what looks like a fully fit squad to select from next week ahead of the returns of Mako Vunipola and Jack Nowell \u2013 though Francis\u2019s availability pends any further action \u2013 Jones\u2019s team look in great shape for the rest of the pool games.\n\n\u201cWe're pleased with where we are,\u201d he added. \u201cAfter two games we have 10 points and have conceded one try. We've had two fantastic experiences in Sapporo and Kobe. We're in a good position. Can we play better? Yes, we know we can, and we'll be ready to play our next game.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nCokanaisga the star attraction as England rout the USA", "description": "Eddie Jones will accept any punishment that comes England\u2019s way, with centre Piers Francis sweating over a potential citing for a dangerous tackle in the very first play of the 45-7 victory over the United States.Francis committed a technically woeful challenge on US full-back Will Hooley from the kick-off", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Rbak8LzFLoK3qJLqBa6T_g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEwNTI7aD03OTA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1.qLrjpB_s6cun5ydYwy6Q--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/073440f3e8ba8aca307d6536b7f76b09", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
