USA TODAY\n\nNEW YORK - A forecast of all-day rain could lead to an early postponement of Wednesday's Game 4 and wipe out the Friday travel date in the AL Championship Series.\n\nThe call is in the hands of Major League Baseball, and it could be made well before the scheduled 8:08 p.m. start at Yankee Stadium.\n\n\"We're watching the forecast, we're mindful of two things,'' commissioner Rob Manfred said before Tuesday's Game 3 between the Astros and Yankees.\n\n\"We dont want to affect the competitive complexion of the series and we want to be mindful of our fans,'' Manfred said. \"We don't want to bring them here if we know we're not going to be able to play.\n\n\"It's just too early to tell what's going to happen.''\n\nIf a rainout occurred on Wednesday, Game 4 would be pushed to Thursday (8:08 p.m.) and Game 5 would be on Friday at Yankee Stadium (TBD) with a possible Games 6 and 7 at Houston as scheduled on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nAnd if a postponement occurred, the Yankees would be able to start Masahiro Tanaka in Game 4 on normal rest on Thursday. The Astros would be able to do the same with Zack Greinke, creating a rematch of the ALCS opener, won by the Yankees, 7-0.", "description": "The Yankees' ALCS Game 4 against the Astros on Wednesday could have major implications for the rest of the series schedule.", "authors": ["Pete Caldera", "Published P.M.
