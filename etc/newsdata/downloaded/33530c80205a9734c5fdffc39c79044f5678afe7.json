There are also features to join strokes that don't meet up, trim the strokes, and straighten them. These are all activated with the aid of a lasso tool.\n\nThe app was developed by Arcadio Garcia, a software engineer who works on the Windows 10 Shell, who teased the release of the app with a quote from last week's Surface event.\n\nMicrosoft last week launched the Surface Laptop 3, Surface Pro 7, Surface X, and unveiled the dual-screen Windows 10X Surface Neo tablet and the dual-screen Android Duo phone.\n\n\"I can't think of a better way to tease it than with this (relevant, I swear) quote from the last Surface event,\" he wrote, referencing what appears to be a slide for forthcoming Surface Neo, which is compatible with a stylus.\n\nStay tuned for an announcement tomorrow: A small side project that has been on the works for a while now.\n\n\n\nI can't think of a a better way to tease it than with this (relevant, I swear) quote from the last Surface event.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd8a\ud83c\udfa8\ud83c\udf0c pic.twitter.com/nzSWACnODA \u2014 Arcadio \"HalloWin32\" Garc\u00eda \ud83c\udf83 (@arcadio_g_s) October 9, 2019\n\nSo now Windows users have the classic Paint app, which now has a bunch of new accessibility features, the newer 3D Paint app, and the SketchPal app, which is designed with Surface devices in mind.\n\nBut the Microsoft Garage incubator has also released a bunch of Android apps, so it can't be ruled out that it could release the SketchPal app at some point for the Android Surface Duo.\n\nThe new SketchPal app is available on the Microsoft Store and is for Windows 10 PCs, the Xbox, and HoloLens.", "description": "Microsoft releases a sketching app that could be useful on its new dual-screen Windows 10X-based Surface Neo.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/10/3baedd49-61ef-416c-a7be-e549aff66e09/thumbnail/770x578/19ecfed699cfe1e229bdcb27b6155883/apps-29286-13856688507974549-72ce5cd5-a1de-4a85-8b7e-b462b1db1d89-9a08eda2-b96f-4a03-811e-180d32e077aa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
