When Hendry County Sheriff\u2019s deputies doused the flames, they found a woman\u2019s body inside so badly burned she couldn\u2019t be identified for days.\n\nNow police say that Bee Love Slater, a black, transgender 23-year-old from South Florida, was murdered. Investigators have not announced any suspects or leads, and the sheriff\u2019s office told reporters they could not say whether the grisly homicide was a hate crime.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say it\u2019s a hate crime yet because we don\u2019t know what the motive was,\u201d Hendry County Sheriff\u2019s Office Capt. Susan Harrelle told ABC 7.\n\nBut advocates say Slater was the latest victim in an alarming trend, as transgender murders are spiking across the U.S. \u2014 particularly in Florida, where the hate crime statute does not apply to people attacked for their gender identity.\n\n\u201cOur society needs to work to ensure transpeople can live without fear,\u201d the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida said in a statement about Slater\u2019s death.\n\n\n\nPolice discovered Bee Love Slater's body badly burned inside her car in the early morning Sept. 4. (Screencap via ABC7/Screencap via ABC7)\n\nSlater\u2019s body was found at the edge of Harlem, Florida, a small community about 65 miles west of West Palm. Slater lived about 32 miles away around the southern bend of Lake Okeechobee in Pahokee, Florida, an economically depressed town best known for producing NFL talent. Her friends say Slater, who transitioned her gender earlier this year, wanted to save money to move to Atlanta, where she believed people would be more accepting of her transgender identity.\n\n\u201cShe always had a smile on her face,\u201d her friend Desmond Vereen, who called himself her \u201cgay mother,\u201d told the Miami Herald. \u201cShe always gave hugs and kisses, always told you that she loved you.\u201d\n\nBut more recently, Slater began posting on Facebook that she\u2019d gotten harassing messages that scared her, a friend told Out Magazine. She reportedly texted a friend that she wanted to leave town the night she died.\n\n\u201cShe posted messages saying she felt as if people were after her to attack and hurt her and she had a conversation with one of her best friends the day she was murdered saying she wanted to leave [the city],\u201d her friend Antorris Williams told Out. \u201cShe was willing to sleep in her car until she found a job and things of that nature.\u201d\n\nSo far, the sheriff\u2019s office says there is \u201cno evidence\u201d about the cause of her death \u2060 \u2014 in part because her car was scorched to its metal frame. Meanwhile, her friends and transgender rights advocates are demanding justice.\n\n\u201cHow could someone go to that extreme to get rid of her?\u201d her friend Kenard Wade told WINK news. \u201cI just want justice for her.\u201d\n\nAt least 18 transgender people have been murdered in the U.S. this year, according to Human Rights Campaign advocates who track the homicides. Last year, advocates counted 26 murders, including five in Florida, the highest number in any state.\n\nWhile Florida\u2019s hate crime statute allows prosecutors to seek stiffer penalties when a crime is motivated by malice toward someone\u2019s \u201crace, religion, ethnicity, color, ancestry, sexual orientation, or national origin,\u201d gender identity, including transgender identity, is not protected under the state law. Advocates say that limitation can leave transgender people more vulnerable to violence.\n\n\u201cThese victims are not numbers \u2014 they were people with hopes and plans, dreams for the future, loved ones and communities who will miss them every day,\u201d writes Matilda Young for the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ rights advocacy group. \u201cAnti-transgender stigma is exacerbated by callous or disrespectful treatment too often seen from media, law enforcement and our highest elected officials.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 6, the day Slater was identified by the medical examiner, friends and supporters dressed in pink gathered on the grounds of an apartment complex in Pahokee They lit candles arranged to spell out \u201cBee Love.\u201d They sang together and held dozens of pink balloons shaped like hearts and stars. People took turns telling stories about Slater and remembering her life. The crowd cheered for Slater as they let go of the balloons, which floated away into the night sky.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here and I\u2019m going to speak and do whatever I have to do,\u201d Vereen said. \u201cHer name is going to live on.\u201d", "description": "Bee Love Slater is the 18th transgender person murdered in the U.S. this year, advocates say.", "authors": ["Katie Shepherd", "Morning Mix Reporter", "September At Am", "Katie Shepherd Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
