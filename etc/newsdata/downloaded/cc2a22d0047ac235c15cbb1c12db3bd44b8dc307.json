And all that followed several companies in China, including some of the NBA\u2019s major business partners there, lashing out over Morey\u2019s original tweet.\n\n1/ I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China. I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives. \u2014 Daryl Morey (@dmorey) October 7, 2019\n\nMorey tweeted an image that read \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d referring to the four-month-old protests in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. That led to Houston owner Tilman Fertitta turning to Twitter to say that Morey does not speak for the Rockets, and sparking an outcry that included the Chinese Basketball Association \u2014 whose president is Yao Ming, the former Rockets star center \u2014 saying it was suspending its relationship with the team.\n\nOther criticism came from Tencent TCEHY, -0.94% , a major media partner of the NBA in China with a streaming deal that is worth $1.5 billion over the next five years, and Chinese state television \u2014 both of which said they would not be showing Rockets games. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if Morey\u2019s new tweets or the NBA\u2019s statement that followed would be enough to salvage those relationships. Chinese athletic apparel maker Li-Ning released a statement saying it was upset with Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\n\u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,\u201d Morey tweeted early Monday from Japan, where Houston is playing this week. \u201cI was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.\n\n\u201cI have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention. My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA.\u201d\n\nNBA Chief Communications Officer Mike Bass said the league recognizes that Morey\u2019s tweet \u201cdeeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\u201d Bass added that the league supports individuals \u201csharing their views on matters important to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together,\u201d Bass said.\n\nEarlier, Fertitta attempted to distance the team from Morey\u2019s tweet with a Twitter post of his own: \u201cListen.@darylmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization.\u201d\n\nListen....@dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization. @espn https://t.co/yNyQFtwTTi \u2014 Tilman Fertitta (@TilmanJFertitta) October 5, 2019\n\nThe timing of this is particularly awkward for the NBA, whose players have often been outspoken on social issues in the United States.\n\nChina has teams in the U.S. playing preseason games this week, the Rockets are about to play two games in Japan and the Los Angeles Lakers \u2014 with one of the biggest global sports stars in LeBron James \u2014 and Brooklyn Nets set to play Thursday in Shanghai and Saturday in Shenzhen, China.\n\nSpeaking at a practice in Tokyo on Monday, Rockets\u2019 star James Harden was contrite as he spoke standing with teammate Russell Westbrook.\n\n\u201cWe apologize. You know, we love China, we love playing there. For both of us individually, we go there once or twice a year. They show us the most important love. We appreciate them as a fan base. We love everything there about them and we appreciate the support that they give us individually and as organization.\u201d\n\nNets owner Joe Tsai is a co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, and posted an open letter on his Facebook page late Sunday night saying Morey stepped on what he described as \u201ca third-rail issue\u201d when it comes to China and Hong Kong.\n\nMy open letter to all fans https://t.co/W9N609g074 \u2014 Joe Tsai (@joetsai1999) October 7, 2019\n\n\u201cBy now I hope you can begin to understand why the Daryl Morey tweet is so damaging to the relationship with our fans in China,\u201d Tsai wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t know Daryl personally. I am sure he\u2019s a fine NBA general manager, and I will take at face value his subsequent apology that he was not as well informed as he should have been. But the hurt that this incident has caused will take a long time to repair.\u201d\n\nThe statements from Morey and the NBA caught the eyes of lawmakers, including no fewer than three U.S. Senators \u2014 Ted Cruz of Texas, Rick Scott of Florida (who criticized NBA Commissioner Adam Silver for the league\u2019s statement, apparently unaware it was made by Bass, an NBA spokesman), and Brian Schatz of Hawaii.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re better than this; human rights shouldn\u2019t be for sale & the NBA shouldn\u2019t be assisting Chinese communist censorship,\u201d tweeted Cruz, who said he is a lifelong Rockets fan.\n\nWe\u2019re better than this; human rights shouldn\u2019t be for sale & the NBA shouldn\u2019t be assisting Chinese communist censorship. \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) October 7, 2019\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Julian Castro, a former U.S. Housing Secretary from Texas, tweeted \u201cChina is using its economic power to silence critics \u2014 even those in the U.S.\u201d\n\nChina is using its economic power to silence critics\u2014even those in the U.S.\n\n\n\nThe United States must lead with our values and speak out for pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong, and not allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government. https://t.co/87U4jgsAAp \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) October 7, 2019\n\nFostering strong relationships with China has been a priority of the NBA for at least three decades.\n\nThe NBA has a China office, just announced plans to add a gaming team in Shanghai to the NBA 2K League, and officials in both countries say as many as 500 million Chinese watched at least one NBA game last season. Several NBA players \u2014 including major current and former stars like Stephen Curry and Kobe Bryant \u2014 go to China annually to promote their individual brands, and the World Cup held in China this summer saw countless fans attending in NBA jerseys.\n\nThe Rockets, largely because of Yao, have an enormous Chinese following. But after Morey\u2019s tweet, even the Chinese government\u2019s consulate office in Houston issued a statement saying it \u201cexpressed strong dissatisfaction\u201d with the team.\n\n\u201cWe have lodged representations and expressed strong dissatisfaction with the Houston Rockets, and urged the latter to correct the error and take immediate concrete measures to eliminate the adverse impact,\u201d the consulate general\u2019s office said in a statement Sunday.\n\nThe Chinese league said Sunday on its official Twitter-like Weibo account that Morey had made \u201cimproper remarks regarding Hong Kong\u201d to which it expressed its \u201cstrong opposition.\u201d\n\nThat underscores Beijing\u2019s extreme sensitivity about foreign attitudes toward the ongoing protests and increasing violence. China accuses foreign parties in the U.S. and elsewhere of encouraging the demonstrations.\n\nThe protests that started in June over a now-shelved extradition bill have since snowballed into an anti-China campaign amid anger over what many view as Beijing\u2019s interference in Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy that was granted when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nProtests continued raging this weekend after the shooting of a 14-year-old boy Friday night \u2014 the second protest victim of police gunfire \u2014 stoked fears of more bloody confrontations. An 18-year-old protester was shot at close range by a riot officer last week. He was charged with rioting and assaulting police, while the younger teen was arrested.\n\nThe Communist Party\u2019s official newspaper, People\u2019s Daily, said in a commentary that Morey touched China\u2019s bottom line: \u201cMorey\u2019s position is hurtful to Chinese basketball fans and is also an affront to the Chinese people.\u201d People\u2019s Daily also noted multinational corporations who likewise tested the line on Hong Kong have \u201cpaid a heavy price.\u201d", "description": "Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey tweeted about \u201cstanding with Hong Kong,\u201d and China, where the NBA is very popular, wasn\u2019t happy", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS759_ap_dar_ZG_20191007092046.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
