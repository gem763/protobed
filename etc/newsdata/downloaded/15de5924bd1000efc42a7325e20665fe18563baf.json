Bush \u2015 and his take is a little different from some of the others in Hollywood.\n\n\u201cWhen I say be kind to one another, I don\u2019t mean only the people that think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone,\u201d DeGeneres said.\n\nRuffalo tweeted Wednesday to offer his two cents on the matter, saying that \u201cwe can\u2019t even begin to talk about kindness\u201d until Bush is \u201cbrought to justice for the crimes of the Iraq War.\u201d\n\nSorry, until George W. Bush is brought to justice for the crimes of the Iraq War, (including American-lead torture, Iraqi deaths & displacement, and the deep scars\u2014emotional & otherwise\u2014inflicted on our military that served his folly), we can\u2019t even begin to talk about kindness. https://t.co/dpMwfck6su \u2014 Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) October 9, 2019\n\nThe actor, perhaps best known as the Incredible Hulk in the \u201cAvengers\u201d movies, also linked to a Vanity Fair article that broke down some of the reasoning behind the outrage directed at DeGeneres for her friendly relationship with the former president.\n\nDeGeneres has been a longtime advocate for LGBTQ rights and is considered an icon within the queer community. She\u2019s known for espousing a mantra of living with compassion and kindness.\n\nBush publicly opposed same-sex marriage during his presidency, oversaw a \u201cWar on Terror\u201d that killed thousands of civilians and troops, and lobbied for the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh even after Kavanaugh was publicly accused of sexual misconduct. Bush\u2019s own top counterterrorism official accused him of authorizing war crimes during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nRuffalo also specifically called out the torture of detainees that took place under Bush\u2019s administration.\n\nMany people were impressed that the A-list actor had spoken out, given how many of DeGeneres\u2019 Hollywood peers had supported her.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of the dialogue on Twitter:\n\nPeople think kindness is niceness. The problem is, injustice should always make us angry. pic.twitter.com/I3y2jQUCX6 \u2014 Jos\u00e9 Vilson (@TheJLV) October 9, 2019\n\nit\u2019s official the only brain cell in hollywood is in mark ruffalo\u2019s possession https://t.co/DTtniO9SsR \u2014 fernanda (@pinoemorgan) October 9, 2019\n\nThis is so misguided.\n\n\n\nRegardless with whether or not you like them, agree with them, or even believe them to be a good person, show them kindness. It's the little things that change the world. If only the world had more people willing to do good for goodness' sake.#MarkRuffalo https://t.co/tm4RHvIfFR \u2014 A.C. Dumnich (@antoniocdumnich) October 9, 2019\n\nThank you Mark for being better than most of your colleagues in Hollywood.\n\n\n\nMore people need to understand that George Bush was a detriment to mankind, even if not as outlandish as Trump. \u2014 Frederick Joseph (@FredTJoseph) October 9, 2019\n\nI think @TheEllenShow should have @MarkRuffalo on her show for an extensive discussion about his belief that kindness is inappropriate at this time. \u2014 Waiting for #12 (@deckacards) October 9, 2019\n\nUnpopular opinion, but I disagree with @MarkRuffalo\u2019s comments about @TheEllenShow.\n\nCalling someone a friend does not automatically mean we condone all of their choices. Being photographed next to someone when you\u2019re a celeb does not furnish guilt by association. #JustSaying \u2014 Angie \ud83e\udd8bJane (@srching4angief) October 9, 2019\n\nHulk out, Mark Ruffalo. Hulk out. I'm just glad someone with power and influence is reminding the younger generation about the disastrous legacy of the Bush years. https://t.co/eld3qmfP7c \u2014 Wajahat Ali (@WajahatAli) October 9, 2019\n\nHe's championed indigenous people and their causes for many years, so he already had my support, but Mark Ruffalo is a real one https://t.co/ehvzk8Cg3V \u2014 \ud83e\udd85\ud83e\udd5efrybread power\ud83e\udd5e\ud83e\udd85 (@RandiFoorDalton) October 9, 2019\n\nI'm glad to see at least one actor (Marc Ruffalo) understanding the issue with Ellen bffing with George W. I was starting to wonder if they all had fallen into the Bad Place or what. \u2014 Mariah McCourt (@TiredFairy) October 9, 2019", "description": "The actor took a strong stance in the fray over Ellen DeGeneres' friendship with George W.
