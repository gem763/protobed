Scherzer received a cortisone shot on Sunday and the team hopes he\u2019s available to pitch in a potential Game 7. pic.twitter.com/0BjTUQK5SW \u2014 Sam Fortier (@Sam4TR) October 29, 2019\n\nThe 35-year-old right-hander, his Manager Dave Martinez said, is available to pitch a potential Game 7 of the World Series on Wednesday \u2014 if the Nationals get there. It\u2019s a surprising turnaround for Scherzer, a competitive bulldog, because he was in visible pain the last time he made a public appearance. He spoke to reporters on Sunday after the Nationals sidelined him because spasms in his neck and right trapezius muscle, the area behind his shoulder, prevented him from moving that morning. His wife helped dress him and later, in the news conference, he rotated his entire upper body to listen to questions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m as disappointed as I possibly can be to not be able to pitch tonight,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s Game 5 of the World Series. I\u2019ve pitched through so much crap in my career that would be easy to pitch through at this point. It\u2019s literally impossible to do anything with.\u201d\n\nThe injury was not related to the back injuries that landed him on the injured list twice this summer, Scherzer said. He called it \u201ca little thing that turned into a big thing that turned into a giant thing.\u201d\n\nThe pain had started a few days earlier, but he hadn\u2019t paid attention to it because he\u2019s had \u201clittle neck spasms\u201d before and pitched through it. But when he got treatment Friday, the neck didn\u2019t feel right, and batting practice, which usually loosened him up, didn\u2019t help. He woke up Sunday \u201ccompletely locked up,\u201d fell out of bed and could use only his left arm. Doctors later assuaged concerns that this might be a serious injury and told him, as long as there was no numbness, he couldn\u2019t do any \u201cserious, long-term damage.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe team and the pitcher then decided he should receive a cortisone shot Sunday morning. It should alleviate the pain but would take at least 48 hours to become effective. It apparently kicked in by Tuesday morning, which sets him up to start a winner-take-all Game 7.\n\nIn one way, it makes sense Scherzer would bounce back so quickly. He has a reputation for playing through pain, including earlier this season, when he broke his nose on a bunt attempt during batting practice and threw seven scoreless innings the next night anyway. He later tried to push through rehabilitation for his back injury and challenged his manager to rein him in. He pushed at less than 100 percent, hurt himself further and landed back on the IL. Teammates, opponents and his manager acknowledged how much pain he must have felt to miss Game 5, a 7-1 Nationals loss.\n\nAstros starting pitcher Justin Verlander, who played with Scherzer in Detroit, captured the sentiment: \u201cIt\u2019s got to be pretty bad,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nScherzer is healthy enough that he could pitch again in this series. It crushed him to miss Game 5, but if the Nationals can get to a Game 7, it might offer him some redemption.\n\nRead more\n\nAD", "description": "The Nationals ace is available if the team can force a Game 7, Manager Dave Martinez said.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4ENKptH2MGYTq82l4kpw3dZxHkk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WDO4CGXZYQI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
