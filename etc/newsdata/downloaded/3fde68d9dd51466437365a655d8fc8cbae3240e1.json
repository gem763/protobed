Probably the fact that he didn\u2019t even get the name of the online store right, referring to it as \u201cChangi I Shop.\u201d\n\nSkeptical, Gienelyn, who hadn\u2019t even purchased anything on the site, placed the caller on loudspeaker, hit record, then preceded to mercilessly mock the scammer until he hung up in a rage.\n\n\u201cThe scary part is, before I recorded the phone conversation video, I asked what my mobile number is and he called out the correct one,\u201d she wrote in the caption. \u201cI wonder where they got my number from or how? They called my number also days ago, so this is their second time.\u201d\n\nSingapore\u2019s seen a surge of such scam calls recently, according to an alert posted on the Changi Airport Facebook account yesterday.\n\n\u201cUnsolicited calls have been made to some individuals asking for bank account numbers to claim a prize in the \u2018Be A Changi Millionaire\u2019 promotion,\u201d the Facebook post said, citing the airport\u2019s well-known lucky draw contest.\n\n\u201cChangi Airport Group is committed to protecting our customers\u2019 information. We will not ask for confidential information like bank account or credit card numbers,\u201d it added.\n\nGranted, pretty much no legit company (or organization, or individual) will ask for those things over the phone, but we\u2019ll give Gienelyn\u2019s scammer credit for at least mixing things up by claiming to be calling for iShopChangi rather than the lucky draw. Not that it worked.\n\nIn the two-minute video, the scammer can be heard saying: \u201cNow ma\u2019am, I send this money S$50,000, I send it in your account. Which bank do you have account in Singapore ma\u2019am? DBS? OCBC? POSB? Standard Chartered? Which one you have?\u201d\n\nGienelyn then asked: \u201cCan you tell me when I went to the airport? What did I buy in the airport?\u201d\n\nHe responded: \u201cYou don\u2019t buy anything ma\u2019am, you take that prize, S$50,000, that\u2019s free ma\u2019am. No pay any one single dollar ma\u2019am. That is your prize \u2026 Changi International Airport \u2026 this money is coming to your account ma\u2019am. Which bank do you have account? Please answer me.\u201d\n\nAt this point, Gienelyn took control of the conversation and began asking the man for his personal details, including his name and where he was from. The man initially went along with it, saying his name was \u201cDavid Jones\u201d and that he was from Thailand. After that, he gave up.\n\n\u201cOh my god, why you need this one?!\u201d the scammer finally screamed when she repeatedly asked him how to properly pronounce the name of his hometown.\n\n\u201cI just want to know you, I just want to get to know you,\u201d Gienelyn said just before the scammer hung up.\n\n(Editor\u2019s Note: We have updated this story to remove the photo of Kate Gienelyn and denote her nationality.)\n\nMore news from the Little Red Dot at Coconuts.co/Singapore.\n\nThis article, \u2018Changi iShop\u2019 scammer caught red-handed by Singapore woman in hilarious phone call, originally appeared on Coconuts, Asia's leading alternative media company.
