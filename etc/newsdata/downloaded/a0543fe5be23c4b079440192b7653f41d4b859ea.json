Last Inflation Numbers Ahead of Fed\n\nMarket participants look ahead to the release of consumer inflation data due Thursday at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).\n\nEconomists forecast that measured by the consumer price index (CPI) in August slowed to 0.1% from 0.3% the prior month, while the core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy price, slowed to 0.2% from 0.3% a month earlier.\n\nThat would bring year-over-year CPI growth to an unchanged 1.8% and core CPI growth a notch higher at 2.3%.\n\nThe consumer inflation report is due a day after the core producer price index topped economists\u2019 forecasts.\n\nThe slow pace of inflation was one of the underlying concerns highlighted in the Fed\u2019s July meeting, when the central bank cut its benchmark rate. At its next meeting Sept. 17-18, the Fed is widely expected to cut rates again.\n\nThe weekly report on initial jobless claims is also due at 8:30 AM ET.\n\nThe forecast of economists polled by Investing.com is for a downtick to the prior week.\n\n2. OPEC and Allies Gather in Abu Dhabi\n\nOPEC and its allies meet on Thursday in Abu Dhabi to review the cartel's oil production strategy.\n\nThe UAE\u2019s Energy Minister recently vowed to get all members to commit to curbs, but said there is no recommendation to make deeper cuts despite concerns about oil-demand growth in the face of weakening global economic growth.\n\nBut the action from OPEC to boost prices looks limited, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\n\"With crude oil well below Saudi Arabia\u2019s target of ($80 per barrel), we feel they have no choice but to continue the current production cut agreement to help support current prices,\" Goldman said in a recent note. \"The ability for OPEC to push prices higher looks limited.\"\n\nCrude oil pared some early-week gains over the past two days as traders fear the Trump administration may be looking to meet with Iran, with a view to a potential deal that could lessen sanctions on the Islamic Republic. That could lead to an uptick in global crude supply.\n\nAsked if he would consider easing sanctions on Iran, Trump on Wednesday replied: \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nOil prices started the week on the front foot, buoyed by expectations that Saudi Arabia may adopt more aggressive cuts following the appointment of new oil minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman. The prince said, however, that there would not be a radical change in the country's oil policy.\n\nfell nearly 3% to $55.75 a barrel Wednesday in the U.S. crude fell $1.57, or 2.5%, to $60.81 a barrel. Brent is the global benchmark crude.\n\n3. It\u2019s ECB Day!\n\nThe European Central Bank is set to decide on Thursday at 07:45 AM ET (11:45 GMT), with the central bank expected to reveal easing measures to tackle economic troubles brewing in the eurozone.\n\nExpectations for aggressive monetary policy easing measures, however, have cooled in recent weeks. But ECB President Mario Draghi - in what will be his penultimate outing before Christine Lagarde takes the helm - is likely to unveil a fresh stimulus package after laying the groundwork at his last press conference.\n\nWith little improvement on the pace of eurozone economic growth and inflation and the option of a no-deal Brexit on the table, Draghi will have to follow up with some sort of action, Action Economics said in a recent note.\n\nThe ECB economy grew 0.2% in the second quarter and the region\u2019s largest economies, Germany and France, saw a 0.1% decline and a 0.2% rise for the quarter respectively.\n\n\u201cMost are expecting a 10 bp cut in the deposit rate, which would leave it at -0.50%. The repo zrate, currently at 0.00%, is likely to be kept on hold for now,\u201d Action Economics added.", "description": "Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED110VV_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
