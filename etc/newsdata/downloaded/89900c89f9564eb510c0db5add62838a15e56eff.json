(Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post)\n\nWashington Capitals center Evgeny Kuznetsov has been suspended three regular season games without pay for \u201cinappropriate conduct,\u201d the NHL announced Saturday. Kuznetsov will not appeal the suspension.\n\nKuznetsov tested positive for cocaine while representing the Russian national team at the world championships in May, earning a four-year ban from international play from the International Ice Hockey Federation.\n\n\u201cI agreed to the suspension,\u201d Kuznetsov said Saturday, the first time he\u2019s addressed the incident with reporters. \u201cI want to say thanks to this organization, to the [NHL Players\u2019 Association], to the NHL for their support and to the fans. There\u2019s a lot of people who are supporting me, and I\u2019m going to appreciate it, and as a hockey player, the only chance to say thanks to them is to prove on the ice. Growing as a person, I want to get better and I\u2019m going to learn from this, for sure.\u201d\n\nThe IIHF considers cocaine a prohibited drug. The NHL does not, so typically a first positive test does not lead to a suspension, and though the league didn\u2019t initially announce any discipline for Kuznetsov, it left open the possibility pending a meeting with Commissioner Gary Bettman to review his conduct. That meeting took place Monday and likely centered on how Kuznetsov apparently misled league officials in late May, when a video of Kuznetsov sitting beside two lines of a white, powdery substance during a team trip to Las Vegas last season circulated on social media.\n\nAt the time, he issued a statement denying that he ever used drugs, and the Capitals and NHL also issued separate statements deeming the matter closed after conducting their own investigations and accepting his explanation. Kuznetsov maintains that he did not take drugs the night the video was taken, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.\n\nAsked if he regrets putting out a statement in May saying he never used drugs, Kuznetsov said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I cannot add anything more. I want to move forward, and the one thing I can do best is play hockey. I feel bad for my friends, for my teammates, for the organization, for the fans that they have to deal with this news. But I will pay back more than people give me right now.\u201d\n\nNHL players who test positive for cocaine or marijuana may be contacted by the league\u2019s Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health Program and recommended to a treatment program, but it\u2019s not required. After the IIHF announced Kuznetsov\u2019s positive test last month, NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly released a statement saying Kuznetsov voluntarily sought help through an education and counseling program and agreed to a regular testing protocol as part of that program.\n\nKuznetsov called this a \u201cpretty hard summer\u201d and said he \u201clearned how to be father of two children\u201d in the process. He and his wife welcomed a baby boy, Fedor, in early June. He decided to stay off social media and focus on his family.\n\n\u201cHe and I have had a number of conversations,\u201d Capitals Coach Todd Reirden said. \u201cThis is a really \u2014 I think it\u2019s a career-defining time in his life. So I think he\u2019s probably a little bit relieved to just be able to move past it and realized that the league has made the decision that they want to make and now we can get totally moving forward. But in our conversations, him and my relationship is one that it\u2019s important that I am there for him, but I also make sure that he\u2019s accountable for what\u2019s happened and realizing that how he reacts to this adversity is what\u2019s important to me.\u201d\n\nKuznetsov was the Capitals\u2019 leading scorer in their run to the 2018 Stanley Cup, tallying 12 goals and 20 assists in 24 games, and Washington is hopeful he can return to that form after what General Manager Brian MacLellan has previously referred to as a \u201cfrustrating\u201d last season. His overall play was inconsistent, with 21 goals and 51 assists in 76 games.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the best players in the league, in my mind,\u201d MacLellan said. \u201cHe\u2019s a big part of our organization, a big part of our team, and he was a big part of our Stanley Cup win. He\u2019s an important member for us and we have expectations that he\u2019ll get back to that level and maybe even better going forward.\u201d\n\nThe Capitals will get some salary-cap relief while Kuznetsov is suspended because his $7.8 million cap hit will be off the books until he returns to the lineup Oct. 8, against the Dallas Stars. With a projected 23-man roster, the team is currently more than $1.3 million over the NHL salary-cap ceiling of $81.5 million, according to CapFriendly.com, so Kuznetsov\u2019s suspension will buy them an additional week to become compliant. With Kuznetsov not available to start the season, Washington will likely have to carry at least one extra forward in addition to him. The Capitals open the season on Oct. 2 in St. Louis against the defending Stanley Cup champion Blues.\n\n\u201cThere is some people who look for motivation in their life and there is always challenges in your life, and for me this opportunity is pretty clear,\u201d Kuznetsov said. \u201cI can prove to a lot of people that I\u2019m still a pretty good player.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Capitals:\n\nMartin Fehervary is the prospects the Caps can\u2019t stop talking about\n\nA long summer might be just what Alex Ovechkin and the veteran Caps needed\n\nFor Caps Coach Todd Reirden, second season is first chance at a fresh start\n\nD.C.
