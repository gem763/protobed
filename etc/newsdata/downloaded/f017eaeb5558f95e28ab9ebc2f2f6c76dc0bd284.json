Photo: Paras Griffin/WireImage\n\nBen: In a column today, the New York Times\u2019 David Leonhardt writes that Democrats \u201cshould be casting Trump as a plutocrat in populist\u2019s clothes, who has used the presidency to enrich himself and other wealthy insiders at the expense of hard-working middle-class families. It\u2019s a caricature that has the benefit of truth.\u201d We used to hear a lot about how Democrats\u2019 central message \u2014 or at least one of them \u2014 should be Trump corruption. But it seems like that\u2019s been superseded by health care and other matters, even as the president\u2019s amorality and lack of ethics spread throughout government. Are Democrats doing enough on this score, or is Trump already enough of a villain that it doesn\u2019t really matter?\n\nEd: Well, this is the primary season, not the general election. I think a Democratic audience might find it a bit tedious if all their candidates refused to talk about their own policies and just ranted about Trump. I mean, even Democrats deserve a bit of attention, right?\n\nJon: No, I think Democrats are focusing way too much on other stuff, including ideas of their own that (as Leonhardt points out) are often unpopular.\n\nEd: The lack of popularity of some of their ideas is actually a separate point. One you have made much earlier, and better, Jon, with all due respect to Leonhardt.\n\nJon: The out-party\u2019s primary contest is often a chance to attract media attention to messages, and a lot of the attention is going to questions like \u201cShould we ban private insurance?\u201d rather than \u201cWhat kind of scumbag is Donald Trump?\u201d\n\nEd: So how do you respond to those who believe HRC fatally erred in 2016 by talking too much about Trump\u2019s character, as opposed to explaining what she\u2019d do as president?\n\nJon: In previous years, presidents have even expressed concern that the opposing party primary is giving a megaphone to lots of hostile messaging about the incumbent \u2014 I remember both Obama 2012 and Bush 2004 having this concern. Trump has no such fear.\n\nI don\u2019t think character is the vulnerability as much as policy and what that says about his character. \u201cCorruption\u201d is a frame that blends both: He\u2019s out to get himself rich, not help you\n\nEd: I\u2019d say the response of about 80 percent of 2016 Trump voters to that argument would be \u201cthey\u2019re all crooks,\u201d rather than \u201cwe thought he\u2019d be different.\u201d True, the other 20 percent are a pretty ripe target.\n\nJon: Yes! even Hoover kept 80 percent of his supporters in 1932. You don\u2019t even need to get 20 percent of Trump\u2019s supporters. Like, 1 or 2 percent might be enough.\n\nEd: There are plenty of ways to skin that cat, which don\u2019t require settling on a monomaniacal Democratic message this far out .Before everyone begins grinding out \u201cCorrupt! Corrupt!\u201d like cicadas, there are a few things I\u2019d personally like to know about what the Democratic candidates actually propose to do if they win. You know, like how they intend to get anything done if they win. So far, I\u2019ve only heard two candidates \u2014 Warren and Klobuchar \u2014 give a credible answer to that question.\n\nEd: I think the argument Leonhardt is making is that the entire Democratic field needs to be focused on general election messaging right now, perhaps exclusively. I don\u2019t buy that.\n\nJon: I don\u2019t think exclusively \u2014 he\u2019s saying their race to differentiate each other has driven them to embrace some unpopular positions.\n\nEd: He \u2014 and you \u2014 are right about that. But he\u2019s also arguing that they need to stop talking so much about themselves, and I think that\u2019s a disservice to those Democrats who don\u2019t just want to take polls every ten minutes and choose a nominee based on perceived electability. Besides, it\u2019s not like Trump hasn\u2019t embraced some equally unpopular policies \u2026 a lot of them.\n\nJon: He certainly has! But Democrats should keep that advantage, not give it right back.\n\nEd: Agreed.\n\nBen: There\u2019s also a difference between suddenly going all in on Medicare for All, like some candidates, and having it be a core part of your identity, like Bernie Sanders. Even if the policy isn\u2019t that popular, people (at least sometimes) respect consistency and authentic passion for an issue.\n\nEd: Well, I guess we should also entertain the possibility that, say, Joe Biden (just to pull a random name out of the hat) might win the nomination, and make it a badge of honor that he rejected all of that crazy lefty stuff Leonhardt is worried about. I seem to remember a term for that \u2026 triangulation!\n\nJon: Ben, you might argue that a candidate seen as half-hearted can more easily walk away from an unpopular stance. That\u2019s how Romney Etch-a-Sketched his way out of some of his unpopular positions from the 2012 primary. I\u2019m not sure coming across as a true believer in an idea most people don\u2019t want to happen is an asset\n\nEd: Particularly if you claim it will magically be enacted via a \u201cpolitical revolution,\u201d whatever that means.\n\nBen: I\u2019m just saying it may be preferable to CONVERTING to an idea most people don\u2019t want. And, as Ed said, Trump campaigned on many ideas that aren\u2019t popular, but his personal qualities and characteristics outweighed any of that. Simply picking and choosing the most poll-friendly platforms and campaigning on them is not going to get you far if it all seems calculated.\n\nJon: I disagree. I think he campaigned on popular ideas and was weighed down by his personality: health care for everybody, regulate Wall Street, middle-class tax cuts \u2026\n\nhe made a bunch of popular promises and hasn\u2019t fulfilled them. That is the vulnerability. People disliked him, but they also disliked Clinton, so that\u2019s how he won.\n\nEd: He needs a second term, Jon. The swamp is full of alligators.\n\nBen: The wall \u2014 his central campaign promise \u2014 was never popular.\n\nEd: Seriously, I think (and I would imagine we\u2019d agree on this) there\u2019s no 2020 silver bullet. It\u2019s about the mix of messages, not which message one monomaniacally deploys. The scary kernel of truth in what Jon\u2019s saying is that, to some extent, Americans want to be lied to about what\u2019s possible in politics. Trump has an endless supply of lies.\n\nWe can have tax cuts, a big fat safety net, the largest military in the history of humanity, walls, infrastructure, lower health-care premiums and drug prices, you name it!\n\nMaybe the Democratic message for 2020 should be: \u201cHow many lies can Americans accept?\u201d But then again, we might not like the answer to that question.\n\nBen: To go back to a previous point you made: To what extent should the Democratic nominees even be focusing on their general election message right now? A lot? A little?\n\nJon: A lot! Voters care about electability.\n\nEd: There is a POV under which advancing the most progressive policy agenda is about electability. The Sanders camp argues that every other minute. I don\u2019t agree with it, but you can\u2019t really say to Team Bernie: \u201cHey, what about electability?\u201d A lot of this does become circular. But sure, absolutely, candidates need to try pretty hard not to say things in the nomination contest that will damage them in the general election. Getting agreement on what those damaging things are isn\u2019t easy, though.", "description": "Intelligencer staffers discuss whether the Democratic Party is focusing on the right strategy to beat President Trump in 2020.", "authors": ["Jonathan Chait", "Benjamin Hart", "Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/08/26/26-sanders-warren.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
