No change would take place until the Corporation\u2019s charter comes up for renewal again in 2027.\n\nDuring a hearing of the Commons culture select committee, Mrs Morgan was questioned about rumours that the next Conservative election manifesto could include the BBC moving to a subscription service.\n\nTory MP Julian Knight asked: \u2018What is your view? Will you man the barricades to maintain the licence fee?\u2019\n\nMrs Morgan replied: \u2018What I haven\u2019t seen is any evidence either way [about] what a subscription-based system would do in terms of revenue.\n\n\u2018The licence fee last year raised \u00a33.7billion for the BBC. They have other sources of income as well. So I would need to understand what, if you were going to change, that would do to their income. Overall I think the BBC is a very important institution for this country. I think it\u2019s an enormous part of our soft power around the world. But undoubtedly the broadcasting sector is changing.\n\n\u2018I think we all know from streaming services and everything else, and the way the younger generation consumes services, it is going to change.\u2019\n\nPressed on her view on a subscription service, Mrs Morgan said: \u2018I\u2019m open-minded and I will have discussions and listen to evidence on all sides.\u2019\n\nMr Knight, the MP for Solihull, said: \u2018This is the furthest I have seen a Culture Secretary go on this \u2013 her predecessor was a real fan of the licence fee. The way people consume media is different now and people are conditioned to the idea of subscription because of services like Netflix.\n\n\u2018A BBC subscription service is an idea that\u2019s gathering pace and I hope we will see some radical thinking about this.\u2019\n\nLast night a spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said the Government has committed to maintain the licence fee funding model for the Corporation until 2027.\n\nA BBC spokesman said: \u2018The licence fee ensures a universal BBC which serves everyone, is the most popular funding system among the public and is agreed as the method of funding the BBC for another eight years, so any debate about future funding is a long way off.\u2019\n\nThis year the BBC faced even more criticism about the licence fee than usual when it announced that it would no longer fund free licences for all over-75s.\n\nThe free licences were funded by the Government, but as part of the 2015 charter renewal negotiations, the responsibility was passed to the Corporation.\n\nThe BBC announced that from next June it would only fund licences for the 900,000 households on pension credit \u2013 meaning 3.7million would have to pay.\n\nYesterday an analysis found that 1.7million pensioners face a cut in their living standards next year when the change comes in.\n\nState pensions are to rise by 3.9 per cent next year in line with the increase in average earnings. But calculations by insurers Royal London reveal that for many pensioners over the age of 75, much of this rise will be wiped out by the \u00a3154.50 a year they will have to spend on their TV licence.\n\nRoyal London says that while most single people on a basic state pension will see their payment go up by \u00a35.05 per week to \u00a3134.25, those having to pay their licence for the first time will lose \u00a32.97 a week of the increase.\n\nIt means that 1.7million single pensioners over 75 will only see a real increase in their pensions of 1.6 per cent next year \u2013 lower than the 1.7 per cent rate of inflation. As a result, they will face a squeeze in their standard of living.\n\nComment \u2013 Page 16", "description": "The Culture Secretary said the 'broadcasting sector is changing' - especially 'the way the younger generation consumes services' in the UK.", "authors": ["Daniel Martin Policy Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/22/19807682-0-image-a-11_1571259818206.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
