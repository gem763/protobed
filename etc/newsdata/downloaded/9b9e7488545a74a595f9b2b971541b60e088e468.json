Photo: Mathieu Bitton/Netflix\n\nDave\u2019s back, y\u2019all. Dave Chappelle \u2014 whom you may know as the Half Baked dude or the \u201cRick James\u201d bitch or the creator of some of the best comedy on the planet \u2014 is back, and he\u2019s still poking at anthills with his edgy \u2026 joke \u2026 stick? My point is, Chappelle has a new special, Sticks & Stones, and the reviews have been a resounding \u201cmeh.\u201d In it, he trods familiar, edgy territory, but he\u2019s more defiant about it this time. He\u2019s proud of his trans jokes, dismissive of cancel culture, and defensive of celebrity status. Overall, he comes off as a very rich old man yelling at today\u2019s kids to get off his expansive lawn.\n\nWhy does Chappelle seem so out of touch? Yes, he\u2019s wealthy enough to not have to mix it up with the hoi polloi, though I\u2019m sure he\u2019s appreciative of the dollars we fling at him for live performances. He\u2019s not even that old \u2014 he just turned 46 on August 24. His chest hair is probably only now starting to gray.\n\nMy friend recently mentioned on Twitter her surprise at Chappelle\u2019s age. I tweeted back my theory that Chappelle is probably dealing with an unexpected aspect of middle age: the hardening of your worldview, for better or worse. This highly scientific theory is based on me \u2014 my favorite test subject. I\u2019m no Chappelle, but I am a comedian in my late 40s, and lately I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time muttering to myself, \u201cNow, that\u2019s a messed-up thought, girl.\u201d\n\nThis is not a defense or endorsement of Chappelle. He\u2019s going to say what he wants to say, and I\u2019m a comic, so my metric is usually \u201cBut was it funny?\u201d It\u2019s just \u2026 man, the 40s are such a forgotten age, y\u2019know? There\u2019s a great deal of hoopla about making it to 40, and then once you\u2019re there, it\u2019s like you don\u2019t exist. Nobody wants to answer your questions; they just keep telling you to \u201cdo your Googles.\u201d Next thing you know, you\u2019re at a gathering and you say something like, \u201cIf you\u2019re not a gender, how will you know what to wear to your office job?\u201d and everyone will think, Whoa, has this clueless old man been here the whole time?\n\nA mid-life crisis isn\u2019t just buying a ridiculous vehicle, pulling a muscle at the gym, or leaving your wife. (It also doesn\u2019t only happen to men, Hollywood, but we ain\u2019t got time for that.) It\u2019s realizing that after 30 years of my being the Go-To Voice (and ten years of diminishing returns), the world has stopped listening. So when you speak confidently about, say, music or sports or dating based on the way it\u2019s always been and a young person informs you of the way it is now, it can knock you back on your heels. A decision must be made: Am I in the mood to reflect and adjust, or am I going to dig in my heels because it\u2019s what I\u2019ve always known?\n\nThis was especially a shock to me because I\u2019ve always (perhaps foolishly) thought of myself on the leading edge of progress. I\u2019m not closed-minded! I\u2019m hip! Look at the pro-choice bumper stickers on my Honda Prelude! Look at my \u201cSTR8 BUT NOT NARROW\u201d T-shirt! But suddenly you hit 44 and you\u2019re told, \u201cActually, it\u2019s LGBTQIA,\u201d and without thinking, you find yourself rolling your eyes and muttering, \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the letters? What happened to just \u2018gay\u2019?\u201d (Weirdly, the pushback tends to start with the change of verbiage \u2014 oh, how we cling to our labels!)\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s why it\u2019s surprising to hear Chappelle today. We\u2019re used to Dave deftly walking us through minefields, with heart and humor. The defensiveness makes him seem crotchety. And maybe he is. But I also understand where it\u2019s coming from. I\u2019m out here trying to be funny around a lot of young people, and sometimes I get annoyed by their newness, too. I turn those ornery moments into m\ufeffaterial.\n\nFull disclosure: I honestly thought the office-clothing thing. Not for a joke \u2014 that was a real thought. Fuller disclosure: I am currently working on (or stuck on, depending on how full your half-empty glass is) a joke where I say some of these nutso thoughts as examples of my brain turning on me. I\u2019m stuck because I\u2019m trying to find that triad of laughter, connection, and compassion. I want you to crack up and nod your head and murmur, \u201cYes!\u201d even if you\u2019ve never been through what I\u2019m describing. I am often mindful of how I perform in front of various generations, and although I rarely let that stop me from telling a joke, it does influence the framing of my material. I\u2019m saying to Gen Z, \u201cHey, here is why your parents are making awkward jokes about your friends. The world\u2019s moving too fast for them, and their elbow hurts for some reason.\u201d I\u2019m saying to elder millennials, \u201cYes, you\u2019re setting the tone now, but inevitably you will be pushed aside, and you may not be ready for it.\u201d And I\u2019m saying to Gen Xers, \u201cHey, I know it gets drafty, but don\u2019t close up your mind just yet. There\u2019s more to learn. Stay fluid. The kids say I\u2019m using that word correctly.\u201d\n\nLuckily, I\u2019m going through my 40s transformation away from most of the public. But there will come a day where I\u2019m going to get tired of being so careful, and I\u2019m just going to say what I want to say, feelings be damned. And there will be people who\u2019ll agree with me, and they\u2019ll laugh loudly because they, too, are tired of being careful. And I\u2019ll start releasing albums with titles like Well, That\u2019s Not How It Used to Be or Why Y\u2019all Keep Changing Shit? I look forward to that freedom, and I can only hope that my old, unfiltered self is truly as cool as my younger self worked feverishly to be.\n\nShalewa Sharpe is a Brooklyn-based comedian.
