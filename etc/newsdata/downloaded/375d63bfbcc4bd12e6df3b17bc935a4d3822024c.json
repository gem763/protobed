And how hard would it be to impeach the president and actually remove him from office?\n\nThe average American understandably isn\u2019t an expert on impeachment. Only two presidents have been impeached by the House \u2013 Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1999. But neither man lost his job.\n\nPELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP\n\nImpeachment is complicated and takes time. Parliamentary democracies can quickly remove a prime minister when a majority of lawmakers cast a vote of no-confidence in the leader. But in the U.S., the impeachment process is a much tougher task to accomplish.\n\nHere\u2019s a Q&A on how impeachment would work.\n\nWhat is impeachment?\n\nImpeachment has nothing to do with the criminal prosecutions carried out by the U.S. Justice Department for violations of federal law, although such criminal violations may form a basis for impeachment.\n\nInstead, as outlined in The Heritage Foundation\u2019s \u201cGuide to the Constitution,\u201d impeachment is the process set out in Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution for Congress to remove from office the president, vice president and \u201call civil Officers of the United States\u201d for \u201cTreason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nThere is also a second process that applies only to the president. The 25th Amendment provides for the temporary transfer of the powers of the presidency to the vice president if a president is unable to discharge the duties of his office, such as due to a physical or other disability.\n\nUnder Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution, the House of Representatives has the \u201csole Power of Impeachment.\u201d\n\nIn other words, only the House can pass a resolution of impeachment alleging that a president has committed \u201chigh Crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d Such a resolution, which requires only a simple majority vote, is similar to a criminal indictment by a grand jury \u2013 it is an unproven list of charges that a president has engaged in actions that warrant his impeachment.\n\nIf the House passes such an impeachment resolution, then the process moves to the Senate. Under Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution, the Senate has the \u201csole Power to try all impeachments.\u201d\n\nThe Senate, in essence, becomes a trial court with all of the senators sitting as the judge and jury. Based on historic practice, members of the House can act as prosecutors.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that it is entirely up to the Senate to decide whether to hold a trial. There is no obligation under the Constitution to do so.\n\nThis means that even if the Democratic majority in the House votes to impeach President Trump, the Republican majority in the Senate could decide to not even consider removing him from office. House Democrats opposed to impeaching Trump say there is no point in passing an impeachment resolution because it would most likely be dead on arrival in the Senate.\n\nHow does an impeachment trial work?\n\nIf the Senate decides to hold an impeachment trial, the Constitution says the chief justice of the Supreme Court shall preside over the proceeding. It takes a vote of \u201ctwo-thirds of the Members present\u201d in the Senate to convict any federal officer subject to an impeachment charge, including the president.\n\nThe two-thirds vote to convict means that 67 votes are needed in the 100-member Senate to remove the president and other federal officers from office. That is a very high hurdle that\u2019s probably impossible to leap over in the case of President Trump.\n\nDemocrats and independents allied with them hold only 47 seats in the Senate \u2013 meaning that even if they all voted to convict Trump they would also need the votes of 20 Republican senators. Not a single GOP senator has called for Trump to be impeached so far, and the chances of 20 jumping on board the impeachment bandwagon are slim.\n\nIf a federal officer is convicted by the Senate, it is not a criminal conviction. The Constitution states that impeachment \u201cshall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.\u201d\n\nIn other words, a federal official can be removed from office. He or she can also be banned from holding any other federal office in the future.\n\nWhat happens when a president or other official is removed?\n\nOn the other hand, conviction does not bar the removed official from being \u201cliable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.\u201d\n\nSo a federal official who is impeached, convicted, and removed from office \u2013 such as a federal judge or the president of the United States \u2013 can then be criminally prosecuted if he has violated a federal law, such as accepting bribes or engaging in treason.\n\nHow is impeachment different from a trial in court?\n\nThe most important point to understand about impeachment is that it is not a legal proceeding like a federal criminal prosecution. And none of the formal procedural or evidentiary rules that apply to both criminal and civil trials in the federal courts are applicable in an impeachment trial.\n\nOther than the constitutional division of labor between the House and Senate, the directive that the chief justice presides when it is the president being impeached, and the requirement of a two-thirds vote to convict, it is entirely up to the House and Senate to set the rules for how to proceed with impeachment.\n\nIt is also entirely up to Congress to determine what it considers \u201cTreason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors\u201d that constitute grounds for impeachment.\n\nThe Supreme Court \u2013 in a 1993 case called Nixon v. United States (a case involving a federal judge named Nixon, not former President Richard Nixon) \u2013 held that the impeachment process is a political question. It is not an issue that is reviewable by, or within the jurisdiction of, the federal courts.\n\nHow has impeachment been used in the past?\n\nDuring the course of our history, the House of Representatives has impeached 19 federal officials: 15 judges (including Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Samuel Chase), one Cabinet member, one U.S. senator, and Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, according to a 2015 report by the Congressional Research Service.\n\nMany people mistakenly believe that President Nixon was impeached. In fact, Nixon resigned in 1974 after the House Judiciary Committee recommended impeachment, but before a resolution of impeachment could be voted on by the House.\n\nBoth President Andrew Johnson and President Clinton were acquitted in their impeachment trials held in the Senate.\n\nOf the 14 other impeachment trials held, only eight resulted in convictions (all of federal judges). The last such trial (which I attended in a Senate hearing room) was of former federal Judge G. Thomas Porteous Jr.\n\nPorteous was convicted in 2010 by the Senate on four articles of impeachment, including receiving cash and favors from lawyers who were practicing before him and lying to the FBI and the Senate during his nomination process.\n\nWhat is an impeachable offense?\n\nImpeachment is probably not limited to criminal acts.\n\nTreason and bribery are clearly criminal violations, but the Constitution does not define \u201chigh Crimes and Misdemeanors.\u201d Alexander Hamilton argued in Federalist 65 that impeachable offenses would include \u201cthe misconduct of public men\u201d or the \u201cabuse or violation of some public trust.\u201d\n\nAccording to the 2015 Congressional Research Service report, both houses of Congress have in the past \u201cgiven the phrase \u2018high Crimes and Misdemeanors\u2019 a broad reading, \u2018finding that impeachable offenses need not be limited to criminal conduct.\u2019\u201d\n\nIs impeachment really about the law or about politics?\n\nImpeachment is primarily a political process.\n\nIf a majority of Americans do not believe that the impeachment of a president is warranted because no actual wrongdoing has occurred (or the public believes that the alleged wrongdoing is not sufficiently serious to warrant removal from office), there seems little doubt that members of Congress pushing impeachment will be unsuccessful and may suffer damaging political consequences at the ballot box.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAfter Republicans tried and failed to remove President Clinton through the impeachment process, they lost seats in Congress in the next election. Democratic opponents of impeaching President Trump fear this could happen to them if they impeach him.\n\nThe impeachment process was not placed in the Constitution so it could be used for crass, partisan gamesmanship, but was instead created to remedy serious misbehavior by federal officials.\n\nIf members of the House and Senate start voting to impeach a president because they simply oppose his policies, we could see a lot more attempts to impeach presidents in the future.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMembers of Congress should be wary of abusing the impeachment authority in such a manner, because it could imperil the stability of our constitutional structure by removing a duly elected president.\n\nWhether you are a Republican or Democrat, and whether you support or oppose President Trump, you should oppose making impeachment a frequently used move against presidents of the United States. Someday, a president you think is doing a great job could be targeted.\n\nCLICK TO READ MORE BY HANS VON SPAKOVSKY", "description": "If the House votes to impeach Trump, it would take 67 votes in the Senate to convict him.
