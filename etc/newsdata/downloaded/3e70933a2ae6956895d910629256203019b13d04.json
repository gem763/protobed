Its proponents hail the method as a way to engage and empower more voters in a highly polarized political environment, while cutting costs in states and municipalities that currently hold runoff elections to ensure that winners secure a majority of the vote. The format played a big role in San Francisco\u2019s high-profile mayoral race last year, and voters in New York City will decide in a ballot referendum this November whether to implement ranked-choice voting in future citywide elections.\n\nRead: Rival candidates try an unusual election message: Vote for both of us\n\nDemocratic primary voters will also get a taste of the format in at least three states and possibly more next year. Kansas, Alaska, and Hawaii all plan to use ranked-choice voting in their primaries or caucuses, and Wyoming Democrats are considering it as well, says Rob Richie, the president and co-founder of FairVote, an advocacy group that has pushed for ranked-choice voting across the country.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually thrilled,\u201d Richie told me. He believes that by 2024, ranked-choice voting will be \u201cnormalized\u201d as a reform in far more primary states. \u201cThere\u2019s sort of that sense that we\u2019re a cycle away from this,\u201d he said.\n\nThe early states of Iowa and Nevada had also planned to incorporate ranked-choice voting into phone-in balloting aimed at increasing access for Democratic voters, but those plans are in doubt after the Democratic National Committee nixed the \u201cvirtual caucuses\u201d because of cybersecurity concerns.\n\nMaine used the system in its statewide primary elections last year and for its two congressional races during the November midterms. It proved determinative in one of those elections, as Democrats gained a U.S. House seat when the ranked-choice system helped Jared Golden defeat the incumbent, GOP Representative Bruce Poliquin. The Republican had been narrowly leading Golden in first-place ballots on Election Night, but the tabulation of second- and third-choice preferences from supporters of two independent candidates put the Democrat over the top. Poliquin sued to challenge the results, but federal courts upheld them.\n\nThe state\u2019s Democratic-controlled legislature passed a bill to adopt ranked-choice voting for both the primary elections in March and the general election, and newly elected Governor Janet Mills, a Democrat, decided to allow the measure to become law without either signing or vetoing it. That move delayed the law\u2019s implementation until the middle of next year, meaning that ranked-choice voting likely won\u2019t be in place for the Democratic primary. In a statement, Mills said that she supported ranked-choice voting as a reform but that there were \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the logistics and cost of implementation, particularly since the legislature did not appropriate any money to pay for it. Adding to the challenge is the fact that Maine is moving to a primary for the first time, after using caucuses to pick presidential nominees in the past.", "description": "Maine\u2019s adoption of ranked-choice voting for the 2020 general election could upend a close race for the White House.", "authors": ["Russell Berman"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_594745352_2/facebook.jpg?1568933953", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
