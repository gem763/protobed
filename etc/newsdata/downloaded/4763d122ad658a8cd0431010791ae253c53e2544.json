I don\u2019t like him, but I have no choice? Well, let\u2019s go down the list: Bernie Sanders says we should let the Boston Marathon bomber vote. Why? Is there a great clamoring to give deranged serial killers more of a voice in civil society? \u2026 Now, I\u2019m sure you can make an argument for this, but we\u2019re trying to win an election here, and this just feeds into what Trump is selling.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cElizabeth Warren has not come out in favor of imprisoned serial killers voting, but she does want taxpayers to cover their sex-change operations in prison. Which brings up the question, if you tried, could you come up with a policy with more third rail buzzwords in it? \u2026 And again, where are the votes in this?\u201d\n\nMaher added, \u201cSo, let\u2019s imagine a slightly different scenario, you\u2019re a progressive voter who likes Elizabeth Warren. You drive a Prius, hate guns, and buy kale in bulk, but you find out that Warren does not support taxpayer-funded gender reassignment surgery for convicts. So, that\u2019s it? Dealbreaker? You\u2019re voting for Trump now? Of course not. This is the binary thing Democrats don\u2019t get \u2026 They\u2019ve got nowhere else to go. So, you can stop wearing your most divisive issues on your sleeve.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "description": "On Friday's broadcast of HBO's \"Real Time,\" host Bill Maher urged 2020 Democratic presidential candidates to understand that elections are binary choices | Clips", "authors": ["Ian Hanchett"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Maher912-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
