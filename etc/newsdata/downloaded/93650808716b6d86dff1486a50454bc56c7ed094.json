My children can\u2019t even go to school, they are being home-schooled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I get called a slag and scum whenever I walk down the street. I can\u2019t go anywhere in my neighbourhood.\n\n\u2018I have received death threats on Instagram. People say I don\u2019t deserve to have kids and they wish I would die in a car crash.\u2019\n\nUndeterred Ms Bellucci is looking for more free surgery \u2013 although she thinks it may be a push to get the NHS to pay for her \u2018Brazillan bum lift\u2019.\n\nIncensed at having to stump up for the vanity work herself she has launched a crowdfunding page but could not help taking a swipe at the NHS.\n\nShe told the Star: \u2018I have to have a bum lift and I am out of work and I can\u2019t pay for it myself and I so need a new bum.\n\nCarla and her daughter Tanisha (Picture: Instagram/officialcarlabellucci)\n\n\u2018I need it for my mental health, for my self-esteem and it is just something that I need doing so bad and I know I can\u2019t pay for it.\n\n\u2018The NHS definitely won\u2019t pay for it this time. (I) don\u2019t know why, transgenders get operations left, right and centre but they will not pay for my bum lift.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
