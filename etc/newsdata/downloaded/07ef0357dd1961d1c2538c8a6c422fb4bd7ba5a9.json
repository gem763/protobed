The central bank also signaled that this rate cut might be the last in a while, barring a sharp downturn in the economy.\n\nThe cut of 0.25 percentage points, which was widely expected, brings the Fed's target rate to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%. Less clear is where central bankers go from here amid signs the economy is slowing down.\n\nAddressing reporters Wednesday afternoon, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell implied the economy had stabilized and that the U.S. is potentially at a turning point in its trade wars.\n\n\"We now have a phase one trade agreement with China, which, if signed, could go toward reducing trade tensions, and would bode well for business confidence over time,\" he said. In addition, \"It appears that the risk of a no-deal Brexit seems to have materially declined,\" he noted.\n\nThe Fed's statement also dropped a reference to sustaining the economic expansion and instead said it would \"continue to monitor the implications of incoming information\" as it determines \"the appropriate path\" for interest rates.\n\nThe shift is \"a clear sign that the Fed thinks it has done enough for now to achieve the mid-cycle adjustment in interest rates they believe is necessary to limit risks to the U.S. expansion from global developments,\" Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings, said.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, government data showed that the economy grew at a 1.9% annual rate in the July-to-September quarter. That is down from 3.1% in the first quarter and 2.9% for the year-ago period.\n\nCBS News poll: Americans split on the future of the economy\n\nThe Fed has now nearly completely reversed the four rate hikes it made last year in response to a strengthening economy. While some investors are hoping for a fourth rate cut this year, others say that is premature.\n\n\"As long as economic readings stabilize and inflation continues to edge higher, we do not think that the Fed will ease again in December,\" Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide, said in a note.\n\nAyers added that financial markets are predicting less than a 1-in-4 chance of another rate cut before 2020. \"There is higher degree of uncertainty than usual, however, and a negative turn in growth readings or geopolitics could prompt further stimulus from the Fed to sustain the expansion,\" he said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed reporting.\n\n", "description": "U.S. central bank lowers borrowing costs for a third time this year, but signals it's the last cut for some time", "authors": ["Irina Ivanova"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/07/10/d79c237c-8cb2-4ea5-8c32-3d50d517631e/thumbnail/1200x630/1c6648ca0d5c6513d20d76b41a7a2d29/powell-gettyimages-1154919489.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
