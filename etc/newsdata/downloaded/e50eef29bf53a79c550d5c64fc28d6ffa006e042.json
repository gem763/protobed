When don\u2019t knows were removed, the margin was a clear 55-45.\n\nProrogation was viewed as acceptable by 72 per cent of Tory voters and 80 per cent of those backing the Brexit Party, but as unacceptable by 69 per cent of Labour voters, 69 per cent of SNP supporters and 78 per cent of Liberal Democrats.\n\nThe shutdown of parliament until 14 October means Mr Johnson avoids having to face MPs at prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday, as well as dodging a grilling from senior MPs on the Commons Liaison Committee later that day, when he had been expected to face interrogation on Cummings\u2019 role, the decision to slash the size of his Brexit negotiation team and his own defiance of the legal requirement to extend Brexit talks.\n\nMPs will be denied the opportunity to scrutinise ministers\u2019 conduct of talks with the EU during the critical weeks leading up to a crunch Brussels summit on 17 October, at which Mr Johnson says he is hoping to secure a deal to allow the UK to leave by the Halloween deadline.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It all but guarantees an election in late November, as opposition parties indicated they will move against the PM once the Brexit date has been put back.\n\nSpeaking in the Commons ahead of losing his bid for a general election, Mr Johnson insisted that he will not request an extension of the Article 50 negotiation. \u201cI say to the opposition benches, if you really want a delay, then vote for an election and let the people decide if we delay again or not,\u201d Mr Johnson told MPs.\n\n\u201cIf you refuse to do this, then I will go to Brussels on 17 October and negotiate our departure on 31 October \u2013 hopefully with a deal but without one if necessary.\n\n\u201cI will not ask for another delay. The public have have had enough of the delectable disputations in this house and I must warn honourable members that their conduct has gravely undermined respect for this house and country.\u201d\n\nMr Corbyn said that if the PM resigned, the opposition would take over as a minority administration to extend Brexit talks to the end of January and then call a general election.\n\nMr Johnson struck a defiant note during a visit to Dublin, saying: \u201cI am absolutely undaunted by whatever may take place in parliament, because I think what the British people want us to do is to deliver a deal and to get on and take us out on 31 October.\u201d\n\nHe admitted that a no-deal outcome would be \u201ca failure of statecraft\u201d and said he would \u201coverwhelmingly prefer\u201d a deal.\n\nBut in a strained press conference, Irish premier Leo Varadkar said the PM had so far failed to provide any alternatives to the controversial backstop arrangements to keep the border with Northern Ireland open.\n\n\u201cWe are open to alternatives, but they must be realistic ones, legally binding and workable, and we haven\u2019t received such proposals to date,\u201d said Mr Varadkar.\n\nThe Taoiseach said he believed the EU27 would be ready to consider an extension to Brexit talks \u201cif there is a good reason\u201d, but added: \u201cI think we would all prefer to have this resolved in October.\u201d\n\nBMG Research questioned 1,504 British adults between 3 and 6 September.", "description": "Voters have branded Boris Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament \u201cunacceptable\u201d\u00a0as the prime minister locked\u00a0MPs out of the House of Commons in the midst of the Brexit crisis.", "authors": ["Andrew Woodcock", "Ashley Cowburn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/09/20/parliament-house-of-commons-brexit-european-union-flag.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
