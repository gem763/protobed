The fleet arrived in August and were created to provide a more comfortable ride for patients by allowing family members to sit with them and medics to work around them\n\nThe fleet contain automatic self-loading stretchers so staff loading patients do not need to push them up a ramp and camera and intercom system which enables the clinician to communicate with their colleague looking after a patient in the back.\n\nAnd are claimed to be 'more efficient' and release far lower CO2 emissions, fuel costs and maintenance costs, according to the NHS.\n\nThe East of England Ambulance Service Trust hopes to eventually bring in 226 of the vehicles by April at \u00a321m, saving it an estimated \u00a33.3m every year.\n\nBut now the 38 Fiat ambulances will be pulled for safety checks by the government agency.\n\nEurope's largest specialist medical vehicle manufacturers Wietmarscher Ambuluanz- und Sonderfahrzeug GmbH have developed the new ambulances which cost nearly \u00a310k each (pictured, warehouse)\n\nSeven other ambulances have been modified before being allowed back on the road.\n\nFiat insists the issue is the fault of the company which converted the standard Fiat Ducato vans and will learn from the incident.\n\nA spokesman said the ambulance 'was not on an emergency call or had a patient on board, no staff injuries were reported' and the rectified ambulances were back on the road within 18 hours.\n\nThe identity of the individual involved in the car accident remains unknown.\n\nAndreas, Ploeger, the German firm's managing director, said they have a 'strong focus on safety' and are taking the incident in Norfolk very seriously.\n\nThe new ambulances contain automatic self-loading stretchers so staff loading patients do not need to push them up a ramp (file image)\n\nThe firm has a 'long-standing working relationship' with the Ambulance Service and continues to provide 'bespoke vehicles to meet demands'.\n\nThe 38 ambulance's completed their checks in six hours and the eight needing modification are being carried out straight away.\n\nA number of different companies are believed to have been used to convert van bodies into ambulances for other NHS trusts.\n\nThe West Midlands Ambulance Service and East Midlands Ambulance Service which both have Fiat ambulances said they had not had any accelerator problems with their vehicles.\n\nNorfolk Police have been approached for comment about the incident on October 3.", "description": "Fiat ambulances converted by Wietmarscher Ambuluanz- und Sonderfahrzeug GmbH manufacturers were taken off the roads after one of their accelerator's got stuck.", "authors": ["Phoebe Eckersley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/11/19918076-0-image-a-19_1571482046385.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
