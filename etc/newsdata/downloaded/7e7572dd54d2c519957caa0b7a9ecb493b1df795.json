(Sudha Krishnan/CBC)\n\nIn 2017, the pink balls were replaced with a rainbow of colours and the installation was given a new name, \"18 Shades of Gay.\"\n\nIn 2018, Cormier announced he wanted another design team to decorate the pedestrian street.\n\nTough choices\n\nA jury will decide on the balls' replacement this fall. The new project is expected to be announced before the end of the year, the association says.\n\nA total of 29 possible projects were presented from firms around the world and, of those, the selection has been narrowed down to four, Brossard said.\n\nThe current installation has received international acclaim, attracting tourists to the area and and boosting the pedestrian street's activity year after year, he said.\n\nStrings of pink plastic balls formed a canopy over Ste-Catherine Street East until 2017, when they were swapped out for rainbow coloured balls.
