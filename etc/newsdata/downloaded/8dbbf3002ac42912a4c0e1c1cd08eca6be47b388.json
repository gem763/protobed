Just 48 letters of no confidence from Conservative MPs are needed to trigger a vote on her leadership among backbench Tory MPs. Were she to lose a vote, she will have to resign as Conservative Party leader, triggering a second leadership election since the Brexit referendum in 2016. May's spokesman on Monday denied a leadership challenge is imminent, but confirmed the prime minister would fight one should it arise.\n\nMay now needs the backing of her wider party in two set-piece events that could hold the key to her future.\n\nThe crisis comes at the start of a busy week for the British prime minister, who on Wednesday travels to Brussels for a NATO summit before returning to welcome U.S. President Donald Trump to the U.K. for an official visit.\n\nAddressing the House of Commons on Monday afternoon, May paid tribute to Davis and Johnson, but admitted they did not agree about the \"best way of delivering our shared commitment to honor the result of the referendum.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the Brexit that is in our national interest,\" she told MPs, adding that she had listened to every possible idea and every possible version of Brexit.\n\nThe prime minister faced a serious backlash from Brexit-backing Conservative MPs, who questioned how the U.K. would be able to operate an independent trade policy under her Brexit plan. Conservative MP Peter Bone said his local activists had felt \u201cdisappointed\u201d and \u201cbetrayed\u201d by the outcome of the Chequers summit, and had refused to campaign.\n\nMay responded: \u201cThis is not a betrayal.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday night, Davis became the first Cabinet minister to resign, accusing the prime minister of leaving the U.K. at the mercy of further demands for concessions from the EU and breaking key negotiating pledges.\n\nHowever, speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today program, Davis insisted his disagreement with the prime minister was over strategy, but said he continues to support May. \u201cIt seems to me we\u2019re giving too much away, too easily, and that\u2019s a dangerous strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cI like Theresa May, I think she is a good prime minister. We have a difference over the strategy.\u201d\n\nDavis, who was speaking live on air to LBC Radio as Johnson\u2019s resignation was announced, said his colleague's departure is a matter of \u201cregret\u201d and insisted that he had not coordinated his departure with the former foreign secretary.\n\n\u201cI had to resign because this was central to my job,\u201d he said \u201cI don\u2019t think it is central to [the job of] foreign secretary.\u201d\n\nThe former Brexit secretary said he had told some fellow ministers on Sunday evening of his intention to resign but that had merely been to \u201ckeep them informed,\u201d and flatly denied that he and Johnson had acted in concert.\n\nHe said the resignations were not terminal for May\u2019s premiership, predicting that the prime minister would win a vote of confidence in her leadership if Conservative MPs forced a ballot.\n\nMay now needs the backing of her wider party in two set-piece events that could hold the key to her future, first in a statement to the House of Commons Monday afternoon before a behind-closed-doors meeting of Conservative MPs later on.\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the Brexit-backing European Research Group of Tory MPs, wrote in the Telegraph Monday that he would vote against the prime minister\u2019s proposed new offer to Brussels.\n\nRees-Mogg appeared to issue an ultimatum to the prime minister to drop her new Brexit policy or risk a leadership challenge. \u201cI don\u2019t think a \u2018no-confidence vote\u2019 is immediately in the offing. I think what the prime minister needs to do is give up on the Chequers proposals, which David Davis in his resignation letter has pointed out don\u2019t deliver Brexit,\u201d he told LBC radio on Monday.\n\nGrant Shapps, former Conservative Party chairman, said he hopes there would not be a leadership election now because there is \u201cphysically not the time\u201d for one now with negotiations ongoing.\n\n\u201cIn a sense [Boris] couldn\u2019t be true to himself I suppose and stay, but I think the truth is this country still absolutely needs to get to a deal or if there is going to be a no deal we need to get there, but there is no time to do anything else in the meantime.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow I do not think there is time to do a leadership election.\u201d", "description": "Theresa May votes to fight a leadership challenge if one is triggered, defending her Brexit policy as being \u2018in our national interest.\u2019", "authors": ["Tom Mctague", "Annabelle Dickson", "Charlie Cooper", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GettyImages-857409044-1024x628.jpg", "published_at": "2018-07-09"}
