Croatia wants to return to a budget surplus in coming years as part of efforts to join the euro zone by 2024.", "description": "Around 1,500 Croatian teachers marched through Zagreb on Thursday as their union threatened a strike in search of higher pay, further pressuring a government already facing down planned strikes by transport and health care staff.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
