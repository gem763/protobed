All but one of the counties have median household incomes below the national average, and they tend to be older and much less diverse than the nation as a whole.\n\nFrom an economic standpoint, they are a mixed bag. Just more than half had unemployment rates above the national average for July, while some were well below that benchmark.\n\nWisconsin, a battleground Mr. Trump narrowly won in 2016, has four of these counties, the most of any state.", "description": "", "authors": ["Wsj.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
