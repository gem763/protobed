This is called a \u2018Conviction Buy\u2019 rating. The firm\u2019s prized list of Conviction Buy stocks reveals the stock picks that the investment bank's research team expects to outperform. That\u2019s particularly useful for investors looking for fresh investing inspiration in the face of current market volatility.\n\nHere we take a closer look at four stocks that have made it to the firm\u2019s list of top stock ideas. Does the rest of the Street have an equally bullish outlook on these names? Interestingly, all of the stocks covered have received only buy ratings from the Street in the last three months. So no hold or sell ratings here. Let\u2019s take a closer look at what\u2019s keeping analysts on-side now\u2026\n\nComcast Corporation\n\nShares in this cable giant are up 37% year-to-date, and analysts believe further growth lies ahead. Ten analysts have published recent buy ratings on Comcast (CMCSA \u2013 Get Report), with Goldman Sachs\u2019 Brett Feldman going so far as to double-upgrade CMCSA all the way from Hold to Conviction Buy. Thanks to \"healthy fundamentals across its key businesses\u201d, Feldman foresees \"strong growth\" over the next three years with annual earnings growth of 11%, free cash flow per share of 12% and dividends of 15%.\n\nAt the same time, five-star Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan has just upgraded Comcast from Hold to Buy. Like Feldman, he has a $54 price target, which translates into upside potential of 16%. So what\u2019s the reason behind his bullish transition on the stock? The analyst referred to a triple whammy of broadband strength, underestimated ad revenue, and secular cable improvements.\n\n\u201cFundamentals are healthy in the near-term, and we think 2020 is setting up to be a strong year.\u201d Horan stated. \u201cCable margins should continue to expand as revenue mix shifts to higher margin broadband (estimated 70% adj. EBITDA margins) vs. video (estimated 20% margins).\u201d\n\nVoya Financial Inc\n\nBased in New York, Voya Financial (VOYA \u2013 Get Report) is a retirement, investment and insurance company serving over 13 million customers.\n\nOn September 12, Goldman Sachs\u2019 Alex Scott upgraded VOYA from Buy to Conviction Buy, citing three key reasons: 1) the possibility of a takeover; 2) potential upside to capital return from life redundant reserve refinancing; and 3) exposure to low interest rates more fully reflected in the valuation.\n\nIndeed, the analyst\u2019s Street-high price target of $85 indicates substantial upside potential from current levels of 56%. Note that shares have already surged 35% year-to-date.\n\nMeanwhile Morgan Stanley\u2019s Nigel Dally has just met up with Voya management. He left the meetings reassured of his bullish outlook on the company, reiterating his buy rating and $63 price target.\n\nThe analyst stated \"We continue to highlight Voya as one of the most compelling investment opportunities in the life and annuity industry following time on the road through Europe with management. Despite the somewhat disappointing second quarter earnings and lower earnings run-rate, we feel the future prospects for attractive growth and ROE expansion are stronger than what is reflected in the current stock price.\"\n\nStory continues", "description": "Goldman Sachs has a special rating for stocks which it holds in particularly high regard.
