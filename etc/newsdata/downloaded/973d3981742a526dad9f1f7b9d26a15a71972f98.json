Thomas Neff, an investment banker, had noticed that Dr. Kivirikko was an expert on collagen and certain related enzymes.\n\nMr. Neff, a former college water-polo star, suggested that the Finnish researcher\u2019s work could be the basis for developing drugs to treat fibrosis. Within months, Dr. Kivirikko agreed to help Mr. Neff found a pharmaceutical-research company.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company, FibroGen Inc., has followed an unpredictable path. In the late 1990s, it announced plans to become a supplier of synthetic collagen for plastic surgery before dropping that idea. Its focus shifted to a drug designed to treat anemia by stimulating production of red blood cells.\n\nThe company\u2019s anemia drug, roxadustat, last year received regulatory approval from authorities in China and has gone through clinical trials in the U.S. and Europe. FibroGen, which went public in 2014, also is working on antibody drugs for fibrosis and cancer. Its market value on the Nasdaq Stock Market is about $4 billion.\n\nMr. Neff, who worked in the 1980s and early 1990s at Paine Webber Inc. and Lazard Freres & Co., died Aug. 25 at his home in the Bay Area. He was 65.\n\nHis wife, Donna Wengert-Neff, said the cause of death hadn\u2019t been determined.\n\nMr. Neff had served as chief executive of FibroGen since its founding. James A. Schoeneck, a FibroGen director, has been named interim CEO.\n\nFibroGen has teamed up with AstraZeneca PLC to develop and market roxadustat in China, the U.S. and certain other markets. FibroGen\u2019s partner in Japan, Europe and other areas is Astellas Pharma Inc.\n\nThomas Byron Neff was born June 18, 1954, in Spokane, Wash., and grew up in Anaheim, Calif. His father was an aerospace engineer, and his mother a travel agent. As a high-school and college student, Tom Neff worked on beaches as a lifeguard.\n\nAt Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, Calif., he signed up for an odd mix of subjects, including biology, political science and law, while dabbling in piano, dance and Chinese-language studies. A friend recalled that he seldom found time to comb his hair.\n\nOn the college\u2019s water-polo team, he was known as the enforcer, charged with retaliation against any nastiness committed by the opposing team. When an opposing player took a swing at his coach after one match, Mr. Neff tossed the opponent into the pool.\n\nTall and muscular, he \u201clooked like an unkempt brute,\u201d said David Kavrell, one of his water-polo teammates. That made it surprising when people realized \u201che was really the most brilliant guy there,\u201d Mr. Kavrell said.\n\nAfter graduating from Claremont McKenna, Mr. Neff considered studying medicine and law at Duke University but then accepted a fellowship from the Thomas J. Watson Foundation to pursue parapsychology in Denmark and suggestology, an accelerated-learning technique, in Bulgaria.\n\nHe enrolled at the University of Chicago in 1982 for graduate studies in economics and finance but left after 15 months without completing a degree. He worked in investment banking for a decade before founding FibroGen.\n\nHe met his future wife, Donna Slagle, in high school in Anaheim and reconnected with her later. She managed a family taxi company.\n\nMr. Neff\u2019s survivors include his wife, their twin daughters, two other children and a sister.\n\nHe served as a trustee at Claremont McKenna. His musical tastes ran to Bruce Springsteen and Luciano Pavarotti. He invariably wore blue suits to work and was known as a hands-on CEO who often worked past midnight and immersed himself in the minutia of biochemistry.\n\n\u201cWhen I explained science to him, he always wanted to know more and more,\u201d said Dr. Kivirikko, the Finnish professor. \u201cHe did not accept simple answers.\u201d\n\nIn a eulogy, one of his former professors at Claremont McKenna, Ward Elliott, remembered Mr. Neff as a freewheeling intellect who was \u201cshockingly indifferent to his own health and safety. He seldom went to the doctor. When he did, he seldom had time to wait for whatever it was to heal.\u201d\n\nWrite to James R.
