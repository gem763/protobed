And those who wait it out may miss out on a rally if Nvidia reports strong quarterly results in November. What should investors do?\n\nLook Beyond Short-Term\n\nNvidia is perfectly positioned to embrace the long-term growth in AI, IoT, and autonomous capabilities. CEO Jen-Hsun describes AI as being thousands of different types of networks. These networks get more complex over time, and the data that gets processed gets bigger. As a result, AI software cannot predict what is going to get programmed. Nvidia\u2019s CUDA architecture is programmable, with its Tensor Cores are optimized for AI.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSoftware capabilities that combine IoT with AI will be the next phase of growth. Nvidia is well-positioned to lead the market when this phase begins. Within many sectors, automation is the future and is something that will happen.\n\nThis transformation is still in the early phases, so the company will not realize its potential until later. To position itself for these markets, Nvidia is investing heavily in itself. In its second quarter, the company reported GAAP operating expenses of $970 million. It is on-track to grow operating expenses in the high single digits.\n\nNVDA singled out AI, graphics, and self-driving cars are the key platforms that will drive its long-term growth. Despite GAAP EPS falling 49% to $0.90, Nvidia is clear on its Q3 outlook. It forecast revenue of $2.9 billion and GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins at 62% and 62.5%, respectively. Capital expenditures will be in the range of $100 million to $120 million.\n\nNvidia\u2019s Outlook for Gaming\n\nSeasonal strength for Nintendo Switch will result in a production ramp-up in Q2 and in Q3, then likely falling in Q4. RTX (real-time tracing) is a differentiating solution to GPUs made by Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). In the last few months, Nvidia announced six blockbuster games that adopted RTX.\n\nThere are now over 40 ISV tools that announced ray tracing and video editing, in the creative tools software space. Some of the applications have AI capabilities that fully utilize RTX.\n\nLooking ahead, NVDA stock may potentially price in the pickup in demand for RTX-powered GPUS and notebooks offering this technology. Nvidia also benefits from the trend of gamers demanding light notebooks that have powerful graphics. Its customers need such systems for 3D content creation and high-definition video editing and image optimization.\n\nThe company introduced a new line of computers, called RTX Studio, that appears to such power users. Considering that the SUPER line of GPUs will spur sales in the quarters ahead and chances are good that the stock etches higher.\n\nTrade War Risks and Nvidia Stock\n\nChip stocks are vulnerable to the tariff showdown between the U.S. and China. Such taxes hurt trade and weaken demand for semiconductor products. Nvidia is not immune to the impact escalating trade wars will have on trade.\n\nThe lack of a trade deal between the two countries may threaten the Nvidia-Mellanox (NASDAQ:MLNX) merger. In March, Nvidia offered $6.9 billion, or $125 a share, for Mellanox and paid entirely in cash. MLNX stock topped $120 by May but fell to $107 recently. Markets are signaling a higher probability that the deal will fall through.\n\nInvestors who held Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) after the former offered to buy the latter did poorly holding NXPI stock. China\u2019s regulators failed to approve the deal in a timely fashion, forcing Qualcomm to abandon the deal.", "description": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been stuck in a trading range between $160 - $180 since July.
