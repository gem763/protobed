I want to show these people how important it is for marginalised groups of people to be recognised.\n\n'People don't have to use the word if they find it offensive, we have had some great support and older generations have also supported us.'\n\nMs Kennedy who plans to launch a podcast under Queer and Co and who has also just launched a Zine, also launched a Change.org petition in order to urge the IPO to reconsider its decision.\n\nShe created the petition a few weeks ago and it is nearly at 15,000 signatures. Today she also submitted the appeal to the IPO and should expect a reply from them in the next 14 days.\n\nMembers of the LGBTQ+ community (pictured above) have pledged to support Ms Kennedy's petition\n\nShe added that people in the community had also been 'shocked' at the decision and said that context was everything when using words such as queer.\n\n'I know it might just be one person who made the decision but they need to be better trained and understand these words.'\n\nIn the rejection letter, she said the IPO cited Ofcom's guidelines on the word which state that 'strong language, generally unacceptable, seen as old-fashioned but also derogatory to gay men when used as an insult.'\n\nWhat does LGBTQ+ mean? LGBTQ+ is an initialism that stands for: L - Lesbian G - Gay B - Bisexual T - Trans Q - Queer + - Pansexual, agender, bigender and gender variant.\n\nIn response to the petition a trademark attorney told MailOnline that the purpose of the 'offensiveness objection' is to prevent the registration of a mark which could cause distress or justifiable outrage amongst an identifiable section of the community or undermine current religious, family or social values.\n\nAssociate at EIP Nora Fowler said: 'In recent years members of the LGBT+ community appear to have reclaimed the term Queer and it seems to be no longer considered offensive by many, as long as it is used in these circumstances.'\n\n'Whilst there is an argument that members of a community should be able to identify as they wish, the IPO is left with a very difficult balancing act in terms of what should be registrable as a trademark.'\n\nShe added that there were members of the LGBTQ+ community that find the term offensive and that there is no standards in place for the IPO to ascertain whether or not the new trademark which has been filed has been done so by someone trying to be offensive.\n\nShe continued: 'This difficulty is also evidenced in the fact that there appears to be some inconsistency in the approach taken by the IPO as some trademarks containing the term Queer do appear to have been accepted for registration.\n\n'Examples include: Queerly Out (registered for music entertainment services, nightclub services, etc.), Queer Prom (registered for various entertainment services) and QUEER (registered for entertainment and nightclub services as well as restaurant, hotel and bar services).'\n\nDespite this she said the initial refusal may not be the final outcome and that Ms Kennedy will have the opportunity to respond to the refusal by submitting arguments and evidence to show that the trademarked company is not offensive.\n\nIn response to Ms Kennedy's petition the IPO told MailOnline that trade mark registrations can present 'complex moral challenges for the IPO.\n\n'We have a legal responsibility to ensure that the trade marks we register do not have the potential to offend.\n\n'We are aware that meanings can evolve over time, however. If an applicant disagrees with the examiner's decision, we would encourage them to respond directly for the matter to be reconsidered.'", "description": "Gem Kennedy (pictured) from Essex applied to have Queers and Co trademarked but was told the name was 'contrary to British values' by the Intellectual Property Office.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/12/19536210-0-image-a-15_1570706592523.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
