Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren).\n\nThere have been three big developments in recent weeks that have left Mr. Biden treading water.\n\nFirst, he has proved to be a pretty awful candidate, not at all the self-assured \u2014 even slick \u2014 politician he once was. At 76, Mr. Biden is prone to gaffes and misspeaks often, sometimes multiple times in a week.\n\nHis mistakes are covered widely, even by outlets predisposed to support him \u2014 and the stumbles just keep coming.\n\nAt the latest Democratic Party debate, Mr. Biden at one point blurted out \u201cgo to Joe 3-0-3-3-0.\u201d Apparently, he meant to tell viewers they should text \u201cJoe\u201d to 30330, but he looked out of it with the blunder. There are plenty more: In New Hampshire, he said he loved it there \u2026 in Vermont. Then he said, \u201cPoor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.\u201d Then he \u2026 Oh, you get the point.\n\nHis string of on-camera flubs has generated headlines like this one from Vanity Fair: \u201cBiden advisors worry the gaffes are becoming a problem.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s becoming a problem.\n\nThe second big twist involves Mr. Biden\u2019s old boss. The former vice president casts his candidacy as, essentially, the third term of Barack Obama. But Mr. Obama quietly urged him not to run and, as it turns out, isn\u2019t much of a friend.\n\n\u201cThe two men spoke at least a half dozen times before Mr. Biden decided to run, and Mr. Obama took pains to cast his doubts about the campaign in personal terms,\u201d The New York Times wrote in a piece headlined \u201cObama\u2019s and Biden\u2019s Relationship Looks Rosy. It Wasn\u2019t Always That Simple.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018You don\u2019t have to do this, Joe, you really don\u2019t,\u2019 Mr. Obama told Mr. Biden earlier this year, according to a person familiar with the exchange.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama has still not endorsed his former White House partner, saying he wants to stay out of the fray and allow Democrats to pick their candidate. That forced Mr. Biden to make the embarrassing claim that \u201cI asked President Obama not to endorse, and he doesn\u2019t want to. Listen, we should \u2014 whoever wins this nomination should win it on their own merits.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, Obama aides and supporters say the former president is worried that Mr. Biden will actually tarnish his legacy rather than build on it. Sure, if Mr. Biden wins the nomination, Mr. Obama will no doubt endorse him then, but it\u2019s still beyond bizarre that the guy Mr. Biden supported for eight years isn\u2019t there for him now. The message it sends to Democrats is deafening.\n\nAnd the third big development came just last week and quickly got swept under the rug. Mr. Biden\u2019s wife, Jill, said her husband might not be the best candidate, but hey, she told voters, \u201cmaybe you have to swallow a little bit\u201d and vote for him anyway.\n\n\u201cYour candidate might be better on, I don\u2019t know, health care, than Joe is,\u201d Jill Biden said on MSNBC, \u201cbut you\u2019ve got to look at who\u2019s going to win this election, and maybe you have to swallow a little bit and say, \u2018OK, I personally like so-and-so better,\u2019 but your bottom line has to be that we have to beat Trump.\u201d\n\nDuring a campaign stop in New Hampshire, she said: \u201cI know that not all of you are committed to my husband, and I respect that. But I want you to think about your candidate, his or her electability, and who\u2019s going to win this race. So I think if your goal \u2014 I know my goal \u2014 is to beat Donald Trump, we have to have someone who can beat him,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Biden has been painted as the inevitable candidate since before he even entered the race. That inevitability is long gone. And as the list of gaffes keeps growing, his fundraising is falling off \u2014 the biggest danger in what will be the most expensive campaign in history.\n\nThe fact that Mr. Obama tried to dissuade Mr. Biden from running and won\u2019t endorse him hurts \u2014 a lot.\n\nBut when you\u2019re not wowing your own wife with your incredible campaign speeches, you\u2019ve got a problem. And when you\u2019re wife goes out there and tells Democrats that they just have to hold their noses when they vote for her husband, you\u2019ve got a really big problem.\n\n\u2981 Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times.
