But Antonio is healthy and is looking forward to his next opportunity in the NFL.

He said the relationship was consensual.\n\n\"Mr. Brown denies each and every allegation in the lawsuit,\" Brown's lawyer, Darren Heitner, said in a statement after the suit was filed. \"He will pursue all legal remedies to not only clear his name, but to also protect other professional athletes against false accusations.\"\n\nBrown was traded to Oakland from Pittsburgh in March and signed a three-year, $50 million extension, but after feuding with the NFL over his helmet type and with Raiders management, his contract was voided and he went on to sign with the Patriots.\n\nHe unsuccessfully filed multiple grievances with the NFL, who outlawed his type of helmet due to updates safety regulations.\n\nBrown's time in Oakland only grew more controversial after he secretly recorded and released a conversation with Raiders head coach Jon Gruden. Following a reported practice field spat with Oakland General Manager Mike Mayock, Brown asked the Raiders to release him.", "description": "New England cut Antonio Brown after he played just one game for the team.
