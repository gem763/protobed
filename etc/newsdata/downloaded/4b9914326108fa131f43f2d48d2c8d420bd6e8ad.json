He also covered key aspects relating to environmental conservation and safety, commercial and contract management, coordination and reporting.\n\nOn completion, the expanded facilities and extra runway will make it possible to handle an additional 30 million passengers annually. Estimates suggest this will provide 123,000 jobs by 2030.\n\nCheong\u2019s presentation was followed by a wide-ranging Q&A session about the major challenges HKIA has to face. The questions showed the students to be engaged and insightful.\n\nPolyU aviation management students lead by Associate Professor, Dr. Achim Czerny, watches airplanes taking off up-close and learn about the 3RS project, during a visit to a restricted area within HKIA.

What initially attracted her was the possibility of becoming a flight attendant.\n\n\u201cI enjoy interacting with people, so being a member of a flight crew appeals to me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m also considering working in aviation catering in future.\u201d\n\nMads Groenli, an accounting and finance student from Norway, is taking an elective course on airport management. He has done internships in the airline industry and has studied Chinese since junior high school. He plans to complete a master\u2019s degree in Hong Kong before returning to Norway.\n\n\u201cHong Kong is a great place for foreign students with an interest in Chinese culture,\u201d he said. \u201cThe courses are a high standard and English is widely used.\u201d\n\nFor Daveena Haditanojo, a Year 1 student from Indonesia who is taking a degree in international shipping and transport logistics, the course on aviation management has made her consider studying that subject in more detail.\n\nCzerny added that it is important for students to get ideas about future careers by learning about the inner workings of organisations and meeting people who are passionate about and active in the sector.\n\n\u201cThese exchanges benefit students by providing learning opportunities outside the classroom which can inspire and motivate,\u201d he said,\n\nThe 3RS project session was organised by PolyU and the Aviation Academy at HKIA to educate, inform and inspire more people to consider careers in the industry in Hong Kong and around the world.\n\nEdited by John Cremer\n\nYou might also like:\n\nLearn about why logistics are the lifeblood of a city with PolyU's undergraduate degree in Transport Logistics\n\nA dynamic career in international transport logistics\n\nCommunication and negotiation skills keys to success for PolyU grad", "description": "Sponsored Feature", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/c11a0721.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
