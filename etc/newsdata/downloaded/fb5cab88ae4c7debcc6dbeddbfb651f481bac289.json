Charm\u00e9 sought to highlight what he sees as a disparity between the intent of gendered costumes. To Charm\u00e9, female costumes are focused on sexuality. And male costumes, such as a lumberjack, a superhero, or a firefighter, are focused on \u201cpower and agency.\u201d\n\nWorse yet, as children grow older, commercial costumes offer different models for adolescent boys and girls. \u201cSexy Mr. Rogers\u201d sums this up perfectly. Boys\u2019 costumes express power and agency, while girls\u2019 versions emphasize beauty and sexual appeal. A large number of Halloween costumes are inspired by comic book/movie superheroes. Boys\u2019 costumes offer extensive choices and possibilities for instant muscles and superhuman powers. Not so much for girls. Their limited options usually include extra ruffles and ribbons for younger children, and tighter-fitting, revealing, and sexualized costumes for older ones.\n\nCharm\u00e9 claims that \u201csexy\u201d female costumes fail to provide women with their own sense of power and agency. Instead, Charm\u00e9 says that \u201csexy\u201d female costumes serve the role of reminding women that they play a limited role in society. In this case, their role is that of \u201caccentuating the importance\u201d of their appearance for the sake of others.\n\n\u201cIf we want girls to grow up feeling empowered by a sense of their own independence and agency, rather than being channeled into preordained gender roles that accentuate the importance of female beauty and sexual appeal, we should pay attention to the messages these costumes express,\u201d Charm\u00e9 goes on to say.", "description": "A Rutgers University professor recently published a column in the\u00a0Philadelphia Inquirer\u00a0that makes the case that certain Halloween costumes, like the \"Sexy Mr. Rogers\" costume, reinforce \"gender norms.\"", "authors": ["Tom Ciccotta"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/sexy-halloween-costumes-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
