That should concern us.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nPresident Trump meets with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro during a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, on June 28. (Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nFederico Finchelstein is professor of history at the New School and author of the new book, \" From Fascism to Populism in History .\"\n\nDespite the growing allegations about his misconduct, President Trump remains idolized by many of his supporters. His campaign rallies feature fans whose devotion is unwavering. When Trump insulted a supporter he mistook for a protester for being overweight, for example, the supporter later said he was not insulted: \u201cEverything\u2019s good. I love the guy.\u201d Trump counts among his fans not only voters, but also fellow world leaders. Jair Bolsonaro, the Brazilian president, also explicitly told Trump \u201cI love you\u201d when they met at the United Nations.\n\nThese expressions of love should be concerning. They share features with the unconditional form of love typical of political cults that has often manifested in dangerous ways.\n\nHistorically, idolizing the \u201cleader\u201d is a key dimension of fascism. In the 1930s and 1940s, different fascist leaders inspired cults of personality, which came in different colors across the globe. In China, supporters of Chiang Kai-shek wore blue shirts, while Brazilian supporters of Pl\u00ednio Salgado wore integralista green shirts. Argentina\u2019s dictator Jos\u00e9 F. Uriburu, Romania\u2019s Corneliu Codreanu and Spain\u2019s Francisco Franco similarly inspired loyal followings. Supporters of fascism fervently believed in the heroic, even Godlike nature of their leaders. Joseph Goebbels, the infamous Nazi propaganda minister, wrote in his diaries about his feelings for Adolf Hitler: \u201cI love him \u2026 I bow to the greater man, to the political genius.\u201d Such devotion ultimately allowed leaders to insulate themselves from criticism and accountability.\n\nInstead of seeing idolization as a natural expression of grass-roots support, we should examine more closely the ways leaders cultivated this particular form of devoted love to distract from obvious limitations and failures \u2014 and to sustain their dangerous ideologies.\n\nAs Hitler\u2019s biographer, the British historian Ian Kershaw, first explained, Hitler made Christian religious images and metaphors of adulation central to his cult. A sense of divine infallibility had once belonged exclusively to the history of institutional religion, but in 20th-century fascism, it was applied to the leader, with supporters developing a sense of sacred faith in him. Benito Mussolini spoke in the name of what he called a \u201csacred truth,\u201d and he also stated that when thinking about the historical destiny of the nation, he was able to \u201csee\u201d the work of a sacrosanct will, \u201cthe infallible hand of providence, the infallible sign of divinity\u201d in the unfolding of events. Hitler made his own link with the divine even more explicit, asserting, \u201cI hereby set forth for myself and my successors in the leadership of the Party the claim of political infallibility. I hope the world will grow as accustomed to that claim as it has to the claim of the Holy Father.\u201d\n\nTaking secular politics and applying the language of sacred ritual helped create a cult of leadership that motivated followers, leading them to persecute and to even exterminate others in service of the leader. For Mussolini, the \u201csovereignty of the people\u201d existed only through absolute delegation of power to the leader, who ruled by force, not consensus. Hitler took it even further. By claiming \u201cI am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord,\u201d Hitler used religious-like faith in his leadership to provide a rationale for many Nazi perpetrators of the Holocaust. Fascists thus tortured and killed with the understanding that their leaders sacredly embodied the will of \u201cthe people.\u201d\n\nAnother consequence of this political cult and idolizing the leader: It led followers and minions to take the heat for their leaders. They absorbed blame for the leaders\u2019 failures, leaving the leaders\u2019 images intact for the rest of their followers. The cult of personality was so strong that it took extreme economic hardship and military defeat to pierce the belief that leaders were infallible, sent by God to renew the country.\n\nA similar dynamic may be at play in both the United States and Brazil today.\n\nWith Trump\u2019s supporters, the attachment seems so secure that it transcends transgressions or failed promises \u2014 and justifies the president\u2019s most offensive and allegedly illegal acts. Fanaticism and feelings of deep political love have perhaps replaced critical thinking for some. Some supporters seem unconvinced that Trump has done any of the things he is accused of, but upon confronting irrefutable evidence of, for example, pressuring a foreign leader to interfere in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, or ominously caging children, they say that whatever he did wasn\u2019t wrong. Trump\u2019s justification for these actions centers on faith in him as an individual: He recently tweeted that Americans should trust him to \u201conly do good for the USA.\u201d They should not ask further questions.\n\nBolsonaro has deployed similar tactics. In the face of controversial actions, such as accusing Afro-Brazilians of being fat and lazy and defending the physical punishment of children to prevent them from being gay, Bolsonaro\u2019s most fanatic supporters believe that, as the Brazilian leader said, he is fulfilling \u201cGod\u2019s mission.\u201d He is casting himself as an epic hero, a Christian warrior of patriotism and family values who must never be questioned.\n\nThese leaders are demanding their followers\u2019 faith, and they are using symbols and language from Christian texts and liturgy to depict themselves as modern-day saviors.\n\nThis is one reason perceptions of persecution embolden them, feeding the savior or martyr image they are constructing. Trump recently deemed himself the most persecuted leader in history, and he seems to relish the opportunity to complain that any investigation into his alleged crimes is a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d or harassment.\n\nLies, propaganda and the glorification of violence are not new in modern American politics. What is new, however, is that the current occupant of the White House is borrowing so many elements from fascism: racism, a pseudo-religious cult of personality, a myth about a golden past where one ethnic group ruled uncontested over the others and a steady stream of propaganda using contemporary mass media forms. The devotional love on display at Trump\u2019s rallies and from Bolsonaro\u2019s fans is a warning sign. It should be understood as a threat to democracy in both the United States and Brazil.", "description": "How love and fascism go hand in hand.", "authors": ["Federico Finchelstein", "Federico Finchelstein Is Professor Of History At The New School", "Author Of The New Book", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2WFWw15sZy31S5y6XNZ5tP3u6xQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GWJG3CE5CQI6TA7DIX663DUNFY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
