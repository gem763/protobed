I think that the biggest news is that the competition now is so much better than yesteryear,\u201d Laver told Reuters.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to just get to the final easily, you fight every match now.\u201d\n\nDjokovic retired in the third set of his match against Stan Wawrinka on Sunday due to a persistent shoulder injury.\n\nOsaka, who beat American teen Coco Gauff in an emotional third-round match, fell to Switzerland\u2019s Belinda Bencic 7-5 6-4 in their fourth-round encounter on Monday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more talent out there at the moment,\u201d said Laver.\n\nThe 81-year-old, who is the only player ever to win all four major tennis championships in a calendar year twice, also echoed calls made by Roger Federer last week to distribute prize money more evenly.\n\nThe 20 times Grand Slam singles champion, who was recently elected to the ATP Player Council, said he wanted to get lower-ranked players on the tour a larger share of the prize pot.\n\n\u201cI think that is probably the best thing that could happen,\u201d said Laver. \u201cThere should be enough to go around.\u201d", "description": "The triumph of the underdogs at the U.S. Open this week shows the sport is in good health, according to Australian great Rod Laver.", "authors": ["Amy Tennery", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425891337&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF821Z9-OCASP"}
