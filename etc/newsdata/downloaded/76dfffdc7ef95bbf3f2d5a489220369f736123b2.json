The move pushed the rate to minus 0.5%.\n\nEconomists had been less certain whether the ECB would also move to relaunch its quantitative easing program at its September meeting, but policy makers did so. The ECB said it would begin buying 20 billion euros a month worth of securities beginning Nov. 1.\n\nMoreover, economists were describing the ECB\u2019s asset-buying plan as \u201copen-ended\u201d QE, with policy makers pledging to continue purchases \u201cas long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates\u201d and to end shortly before the ECB begins to raise key interest rates.\n\nOPEN-ENDED QE. Let that sink in. Much more important than the monthly pace of asset purchases, i.e. even better than we hoped. \u2014 Frederik Ducrozet (@fwred) September 12, 2019\n\nThe ECB took other steps as well. It extended its so-called forward guidance on rates, saying they would remain at \u201cpresent or lower levels\u201d until the inflation outlook \u201crobustly\u201d converges with the bank\u2019s target inflation rate of near but just below 2%. Previously, the ECB said it intended rates to remain at present or lower levels through the first half of next year.\n\nThe ECB also made adjustments to its targeted long-term refinancing operations to further encourage lending and, in a bid to ease pressure on bank profitability from a lower deposit rate, announced it would introduce a tiered system that would exempt a chunk of excess reserves parked by banks with the ECB from the negative rate.\n\n\u201cWe will get more details in the press conference shortly, but on first glance this looks like a pretty dovish package. It remains doubtful, however, that this will do much to reboot the euro-zone economy let alone achieve the near-2% inflation target,\u201d said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, in a note.\n\nThe decision drew the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has previously accused the ECB of working to undercut the dollar. On Thursday, he used the decision as an excuse to again bash the U.S. Federal Reserve via Twitter:\n\nEuropean Central Bank, acting quickly, Cuts Rates 10 Basis Points. They are trying, and succeeding, in depreciating the Euro against the VERY strong Dollar, hurting U.S. exports.... And the Fed sits, and sits, and sits. They get paid to borrow money, while we are paying interest! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 12, 2019\n\nThe euro EURUSD, -0.6903% fell verus the U.S. dollar to trade at $1.0957, down 0.5%, trading near a two-year low. The pan-Euroepan Stoxx 600 index SXXP, +0.35% was up 0.5%.\n\nThe moves will provide plenty of fodder for questions when ECB President Mario Draghi holds a news conference at the bank\u2019s Frankfurt headquarters at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.", "description": "The European Central Bank delves deep into its toolbox, cutting its deposit rate further into negative territory, launching a new round of monthly bond...", "authors": ["William Watts", "Deputy Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GF023_draghi_ZG_20180307171815.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
