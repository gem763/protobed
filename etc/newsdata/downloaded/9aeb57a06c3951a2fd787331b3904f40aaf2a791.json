Duncan Hunter is under indictment and former Sheriff Joe Arpaio won a presidential pardon, but hasn\u2019t won much else.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s earliest supporters have not fared well, for the most part.\n\nThe travails of those who worked for Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign have been well documented. Former Chairman Paul Manafort is in jail, snared by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe. Former national security aide Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to investigators and turned state\u2019s evidence. Top strategist Stephen K. Bannon took a White House job, then lost it.\n\nBut those kinds of shakeups happen in any campaign or White House. A remarkable run of ill luck has befallen many of the politicians who backed Mr. Trump.\n\nThe only two members of Congress indicted since 2017 happen to be the two who first endorsed Mr. Trump. Another lost her seat in a Republican primary just months after backing Mr. Trump.\n\nThe only senator to endorse him, Mr. Sessions, was unceremoniously ousted as attorney general last year.\n\n\u201cBecause of Trump, a lot of people had to suffer,\u201d said Mr. Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, who became the president\u2019s first high-profile backer in January 2016. \u201cAlthough on a smaller scale, I\u2019m a good example of that. I feel for some of these guys; they are going after them to get to him.\u201d\n\nMonths after Mr. Arpaio backed Mr. Trump, he would be indicted by the Obama Justice Department on charges of criminal contempt of court. He would then lose his bid for re-election in November.\n\nA judge found him guilty of the contempt charge in July 2017, but Mr. Trump stepped in with a presidential pardon.\n\nEven that hasn\u2019t quelled matters, though. The president\u2019s opponents are in court even now trying to usurp the chief executive\u2019s pardon.\n\nAmid those headwinds, Mr. Arpaio lost a bid to win the U.S. Senate seat from Arizona last year. Now he\u2019s suing detractors and he has once again thrown his hat in the political ring, announcing last weekend he would seek the sheriff\u2019s job again in 2020.\n\nHe plans on doing so backing Mr. Trump all the way.\n\n\u201cI support Trump from the heart, you understand?\u201d he said.\n\nThe travails of Mr. Trump\u2019s early backers are all the more noticeable perhaps because he had so few of them. For the most part, the party\u2019s politicians kept him at arm\u2019s length \u2014 many because they were convinced he would lose.\n\n\u201cHistorically, it has been rare for a major party nominee to have as few endorsements as Trump had in 2016,\u201d said Margaret O\u2019Mara, a history professor at the University of Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s an indication of his outsider status as well as another marker of how remarkable the shift in the GOP has been post-election toward allying with Trump so unfailingly.\u201d\n\nLike Mr. Arpaio, those who did back Mr. Trump usually saw themselves as outsiders \u2014 such as Mr. Hunter and Rep. Chris Collins, the first two House Republicans to endorse Mr. Trump in 2016.\n\nMr. Collins held onto his New York seat by the barest of margins last year as he fended off questions about charges against him. The FBI arrested Mr. Collins and his son, Cameron, a year ago, charging them with insider trading and giving false statements to investigators.\n\nThe Collinses have pleaded not guilty to the charges, which stem from a biopharmaceutical company of which Mr. Collins was a board member and his son a major shareholder.\n\nHis office didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn Mr. Hunter\u2019s case, the federal case involves campaign money allegedly spent improperly on personal matters, and he and his wife were indicted the same month Mr. Collins and his son were arrested.\n\nFederal agents reportedly began looking into Mr. Hunter\u2019s campaign spending in 2017, following a complaint from the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\nThe congressman\u2019s wife pleaded guilty in June to a corruption charge, citing her husband as a co-conspirator in the alleged scheme to use some $250,000 in campaign money on personal expenses.\n\nQuestions sent to Mr. Hunter, 42, a former Marine who followed his father into Congress, were deferred to his legal team, which declined comment.\n\nFormer Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, long a leading conservative pushing for an immigration crackdown, backed Mr. Trump in late February 2016, saying his tough talk on border issues was welcome news for the GOP.\n\nMr. Kobach would flirt with offers of jobs in the Trump administration in 2017 and ended up vice chairman of the president\u2019s voter-integrity commission. That effort crumbled in 2018 amid a mountain of legal challenges, and Mr. Kobach instead mounted a bid for Kansas governor, where he unseated the sitting Republican governor in a primary but lost the general election.\n\nMr. Kobach then vied to be Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration czar, but his chances soured after someone in the process leaked his list of demands, creating an embarrassing week of coverage that likely helped doom his chances.\n\nTo be sure, not all elected officials who jumped on the Trump bandwagon early have seen such a decline in their fortunes.\n\nThen-Rep. Kevin Cramer announced support for Mr. Trump in April 2016, as the primaries were winding down but before the nominating convention. Mr. Cramer would go on to easily defeat Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota\u2019s Senate race last year.\n\nMr. Cramer recalled huddling with Mr. Hunter, Mr. Collins and Mr. Sessions \u2014 the lone outposts of Trump support in Congress \u2014 during 2016, meetings at which Rick Dearborn would serve as a liaison to the Trump camp, and watching with delight as both his and Mr. Trump\u2019s fortunes rose.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d see taglines that described me as an \u2018energy adviser to the Trump campaign,\u2019 but it\u2019s not like I was checking with anyone about what I said,\u201d he told The Washington Times. \u201cCertainly the status of being associated with Trump was good for me. It really was good for me. I wound up being viewed as more legitimate.\u201d\n\nAfter talking to constituents and studying the state, Mr. Cramer said it was clear to him early in 2016 that Mr. Trump enjoyed the support of most North Dakotans, even if that bunch did not include GOP elders in the state. Consequently, he did not think he was jeopardizing his career by backing Mr. Trump early.\n\nBut he is aware of how others who shared his early support of Mr. Trump seem to have run afoul of powerful interests.\n\n\u201cI do think there are people in the Swamp who view those of us associated with Donald Trump as the enemy,\u201d Mr. Cramer said. \u201cWhat I worry is that even two full terms could hardly bust these bureaucrats up. I can see even today where a lot of them are just gritting their teeth and says, \u2018We\u2019ll wait these bastards out,\u2019 but I want to bust up the club.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
