For years, we watched the media trash and diss Bush, and then turn around and act like Obama\u2019s shiznit didn\u2019t stink. But what we\u2019re looking at with Trump is something far different, far nastier. It\u2019s not enough for the media to report bad stuff about the president now, it seems more like they\u2019re on a mission to destroy him.\n\nAnd the people who voted for him.\n\nIt feels far more personal if that makes sense.\n\nTrump was the breaking point between just sort of nuts (as the media was) and going off on a three state killing spree (I always knew that person was capable) sort of deal that they are doing now. \u2014 C.H.

The Liberal MSM has been biased for decades, they just ripped the band aide off 3 years ago.\n\nAmerican\u2019s will never trust journalism/MSM again, when we have to do our own research to find the truth, we no longer need MSM. \u2014 ACAB (@AbacusCoins) October 20, 2019\n\nTo late, we are already engaged, and our politicians make it so easy for us to be polarized. \u2014 inkakiev\ud83d\uddfd\ud83d\udef8\u2604 (@inkakiev) October 20, 2019\n\nAlso a fair point.\n\nFor those able to read unintended implication, there is still news. For example, the lack of even an appearance of a flicker of evident embarrassment, from Democratic leadership, when the Democrat 9/10 of big media blatantly takes their side, says much about Democrat priorities. \u2014 Phil Nelson (@r2nets) October 20, 2019\n\nThe media needs to register as lobbyists for the Dem party \ud83d\ude44 \u2014 Ellie Mae (@EllieMa85677897) October 20, 2019\n\nAt least then they\u2019d be more honest.\n\nRelated:\n\n\u2018Beyond EMBARRASSING\u2019 \u2013> Nancy Pelosi\u2019s attempt to blame the GOP for her failures in pushing to impeach Trump BACKFIRES\n\nMake it STOP: Hillary tries to be funny in response to Cory Booker\u2019s Tulsi Gabbard tweet and sweet baby JEEBUS the cringe\n\nAWKWARD: AOC keeps it fake friendly but you can tell Neera Tanden trying to \u2018But Hillary\u2019 her Bernie speech pissed her off", "description": "Nothing to see here, just Kimberley nuking the mainstream media.", "authors": ["Sam Janney", "Posted At Am On October", "Sam J."], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/micdrop.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
