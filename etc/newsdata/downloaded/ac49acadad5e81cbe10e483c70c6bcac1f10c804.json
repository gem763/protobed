Echoing his message, Stephanie Grisham, who is the current press secretary, tweeted that the headline had left her speechless.\n\nI have no words. https://t.co/4zH9Ji0Smy \u2014 Stephanie Grisham (@PressSec) October 27, 2019\n\nThough the headline was then changed a second time to refer to Baghdadi as an \u201cextremist leader,\u201d Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign seized on the previous version, sharing a screenshot of the wording alongside an image of an apparent ISIS beheading.\n\nThe campaign\u2019s national press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, and its director of communications, Tim Murtaugh, also raised criticism of the obituary, the latter taking issue with the text of the article as well, which describes Baghdadi as \u201can austere religious scholar.\u201d\n\nThe @washingtonpost described the death of al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, as the death of an \u201caustere religious scholar\u201d!\n\n\n\nRealizing their idiocy, WAPO has apparently now changed this asinine headline \u2b07\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/9LByadwMop \u2014 Kayleigh McEnany (@kayleighmcenany) October 27, 2019\n\nA lot is being made of the @washingtonpost\u2019s now-changed headline of al-Baghdadi\u2019s obit.\n\n\n\nBut how about this from the body of the obit itself?\n\n\n\n\u201c... an austere religious scholar with wire-frame glasses and no known aptitude for fighting and killing.\u201d\n\n\n\n(1/2) \u2014 Tim Murtaugh (@TimMurtaugh) October 27, 2019\n\n\u201cThe headline should never have read that way and we changed it quickly,\u201d Kristine Coratti Kelly, The Washington Post\u2019s vice president of communications, said in a statement to HuffPost.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump announced in a press conference that Baghdadi, who had been the target of a years-long international manhunt, died during a U.S. military raid the night before in northern Syria. According to the president, American military dogs ran after Baghdadi as he and three of his children dashed into a dead-end tunnel. All were killed when Baghdadi detonated a suicide vest.\n\nThe operation has dealt a blow to the terrorist organization. There is no indication as to who may replace him.\n\nThis story has been updated to include Kelly\u2019s statement.", "description": "The headline on the obituary for the leader of the so-called Islamic State has since been changed, but critics are outraged.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db5c6c0210000872ead405f.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
