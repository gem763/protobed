No matter who you might be \u2014 angry farmer, cynical journalist, president of an African nation \u2014 Chirac could convince you, in five seconds or five minutes, that you had his sole, undivided attention. To meet Chirac was to adore Chirac. It was a great talent that he abused for four decades.\n\nThe great statesman spent 25 frenetic years plotting against enemies, backstabbing his friends and zig-zagging on policy and principle to reach the summit of the French political system. He spent 12 lazy and confused years as president of the Republic, achieving little at a time when the French economy was wandering off track.\n\nRather than any fixed principles, Chirac was motivated by his own advancement.\n\nAs president, Chirac toyed for a few months with radical reform, retreated, called an unnecessary parliamentary election and lost. He spent a mostly idle four years with a Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, running the country. His second term \u2014 won in 2002 after going up against far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen \u2014 was a time of drift, indecision, rebellion in the multiracial banlieues and a lost referendum on an EU constitution he scarcely defended.\n\nHe made and re made the French center right several times in his own selfish interest. He bequeathed to the nation a corrupt and internally divided party, the UMP, later Les R\u00e9publicains, which imploded within a few years.\n\nDespite a mostly idle presidency, some of his actions do deserve praise. There was, of course, his stand against the American-British invasion of Iraq in 2003. His resistance to pressure to join was not just wise but courageous. Accused of being a cowardly \"surrender monkey\" and a client of Saddam Hussein, 16 years later his arguments appear better-founded than those of the then U.S. President George W. Bush and then British Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nChirac also deserves credit for having resisted racism through most of his political career and for resisting any kind of rapprochement with Le Pen\u2019s xenophobic National Front. He was also the president to have the courage to recognize \u2014 and apologize for \u2014 the role the French state played in the persecution of Jews during World War II.\n\nHe can also credibly claim to have saved the lives of tens of thousands of his fellow citizens by being the first French leader to insist, in 2002, that the country's road traffic laws be enforced properly. The effect on road deaths was dramatic.\n\nBut ultimately, it's fair to say Chirac was interested in just one thing: power.\n\nRather than any fixed principles, Chirac was motivated by his own advancement. His career was a bewildering pattern of political zig-zags, from far-left student to anti-Gaullist to virulent Euroskeptic and finally European visionary, whose rallies were flooded with blue and yellow flags. The Thatcherite, anti-state, pro-market, privatizing prime minister of 1986-1988 mutated into a presidential candidate with a social conscience, who fervently campaigned against the euro, unemployment and \"social fracture\" in 1995, then went on to embrace the euro and a strong franc, but did nothing for social fracture and dithered as unemployment boomed.\n\nChirac was the symbol, and greatest practitioner, of that classic form of French politics \u2014 clientelist but close to the people, fundamentally anti-democratic but respectful of core French obsessions and the country's self-image.\n\nHis tragedy is that he came to power at a time when those old themes and approaches no longer served France\u2019s needs and could not help adjust an over-centralized country to the new European and global economic realities.\n\nIn retirement and illness, Chirac \u2014 who was as detested as any French president while in office \u2014 came to be regarded as a rascally great uncle, a man whose faults were mostly endearing and who had stood up to Washington in 2003, at least.\n\nNostalgia for a lost era in French life has tinted his legacy. France may be mourning the loss of a formidable statesman and an emblem of French politics. But the French also know they are better off moving on from his disarming, yet destructive, brand of politics.\n\nJohn Lichfield is a former foreign editor of the Independent and was the newspaper\u2019s Paris correspondent for 20 years.", "description": "Former president was the symbol, and greatest practitioner, of that classic form of French politics \u2014 clientelist but close to the people.", "authors": ["John Lichfield", "Paul Dallison", "Paul Taylor"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1170717516-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
