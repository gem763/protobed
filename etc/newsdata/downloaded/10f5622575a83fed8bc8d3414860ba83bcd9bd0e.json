But that support is drawing a backlash as fans come to realize that money is more important to these same players who parade themselves as political progressives and who criticize America over and over again.\n\nLeading the pack of players enriching themselves with Chinese money is L.A. Lakers star LeBron James who is the lucky recipient of a one-billion-dollar deal with Nike, a company that is seeing incredible windfalls with the opening Chinese markets.\n\nAccording to Fox Business:\n\n[LeBron] holds a lifetime deal valued at $1 billion with sports retail giant Nike, which saw its sales in China surge 27 percent to nearly $1.7 billion in its most recent fiscal quarter alone. James\u2019 signature sneaker line is one of Nike\u2019s most prominent offerings. James\u2019 standing in China could also impact the future efforts of his media production company, SpringHill Entertainment. The firm is producing \u201cSpace Jam 2,\u201d the highly anticipated sequel to NBA legend Michael Jordan\u2019s original film, which will seek a massive return from Chinese audiences.\n\nBut LeBron James is not the only NBA player raking in cash with Chinese deals.\n\nIndeed, while James is earning his windfall indirectly through Nike, other players have more explicit ties to China.\n\nAccording to CBS News:\n\nRetired Miami Heat guard Dwayne Wade, one of James\u2019s closest friends, in 2018 signed a shoe endorsement deal with Chinese apparel company Li-Ning that earns him $12 million a year.\n\nPortland Trailblazers guard CJ McCollum also has a shoe endorsement deal with Li-Ning, though the dollar amount hasn\u2019t been made public.\n\nGolden State Warriors guard Klay Thompson has a 10-year shoe endorsement deal with Chinese shoe manufacturer Anta worth $9 million a year.\n\nBoston Celtics forward Gordon Hayward and Rajon Rondo, James\u2019s teammate in Los Angeles, also have Anta deals.\n\nThe league itself is also earning big money with China. The NBA has a deal with Chinese Internet provider Tencent worth $1.5 billion, and the Chinese basketball leagues working in cooperation with the NBA are earning the league $4 billion.\n\n\u201cWhile it is impossible to accurately estimate the NBA\u2019s income derived from China, it has been conservatively estimated to be approximately $500 million,\u201d Bentley University sports law professor Steven Weisman told CBS. \u201cThese funds, in turn, affect the NBA\u2019s salary cap and the funds allocated based on the salary cap to players\u2019 contracts.\u201d\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "As NBA players increasingly lineup in support of the oppressive Chinese government, it's becoming evident that the main motivating factor is", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Getty-Images24-3-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
