Revenue collection will also go a long way to build a more sustainable future and drive the country's economy.\"\n\nProcesses must be followed\n\nSpeaking to News24, Newcastle municipality spokesperson Dumisani Thabethe said they were trying to get Eskom to understand that \"processes\" had to be followed.\n\n\"The challenge here is to get Eskom to understand we have processes to follow to present a foolproof payment plan.\"\n\nHe said that \"in the absence of engagements\", submitting a payment plan hastily could lead the municipality to continue to default.\n\n\"What we are hoping to achieve, is to strengthen inter-governmental relations with Eskom. We want to come up with this plan which is affordable without any hiccups.\"\n\nThabethe said they were engaging with the community and keeping them abreast of developments.\n\nAccumulating debt\n\n\"They have a fear and they are not happy, which is natural.\"\n\nHe said the municipality hoped the High Court would grant it leverage to engage further with Eskom.\n\n\"There is no point in saying we will pay if we are failing immediately the next day. We must involve the municipality executive and councillors. They don't meet willy-nilly.\"\n\nEskom has been threatening to turn off the town's power supply due to a R200m debt that has been accumulating for more than two years.\n\nThe power supplier \u2013 which faces its own massive challenges following years of corruption and looting in the billions \u2013 said the threat to cut electricity supply is part of its strategy to recover debt from defaulting municipalities.", "description": "Eskom says the Newcastle municipality in KwaZulu-Natal will not have its electricity supply cut off - for now.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9197/24562eccb05542fe8fe7faf3773a79c7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
