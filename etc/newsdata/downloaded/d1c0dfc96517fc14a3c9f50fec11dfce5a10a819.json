[Photo/IC]\n\nGoogle is reportedly considering buying Firework, a US-based video sharing platform, in an apparent move to counter competition from TikTok \u2013 known in China as Douyin \u2013 in the exploding short video market.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal cited insiders saying Google held talks with the video sharing startup, although these talks may lead to a partnership rather than acquisition. Sources said Chinese Twitter-like platform Sina Weibo also expressed interest in a Firework acquisition, but talks with Google are \"further along\", according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nValued at over $100 million in a fundraising campaign earlier this year, Firework is owned by Loop Now Technologies in Redwood City, California.\n\nIn spite of some similarities, the US video platform differs to TikTok, owned by the Chinese company Bytedance, in key areas.\n\nThe app of the social media platform Firework.

TikTok said in July that it currently has 500 million users globally.\n\nConsidering the increasing popularity of short videos, social media players \u2013 either giants or startups \u2013 are showing a desire to grab a bigger piece of the pie.\n\nIn the US, Facebook is reportedly testing a similar app called Lasso, while messaging app Snapchat is experimenting with adding a feature similar to TikTok.\n\nIn China, TikTok alongside other Chinese short video apps, has been making inroads into international markets, despite some resistance from local governments and fierce competition.\n\n\n\nLikee, another short video app that originated in China, ranked among the top 10 in the Indonesia Play Store, according to the mobile data and analytics service provider App Annie.
