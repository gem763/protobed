Thom Tillis, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, to call for an investigation into the Fed\u2019s independence.\n\nHowever, Dudley walked back some of the comments on Wednesday, instead saying that policymakers should \u201cnever be motivated by political considerations,\u201d and that doing so would be detrimental to not only the perception of the central bank, but also to its interests.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nBut Dudley continued to blame Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Powell and the central bank for not aggressively cutting interest rates while blaming them for wild market fluctuations, for politicizing the Fed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Fed should be attacked for the economy\u2019s performance when the president\u2019s own actions are creating the downside risks,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn my view, President Trump\u2019s persistent attacks on the Fed have politicized the central bank. People now wonder whether the president\u2019s attacks are influencing the Fed\u2019s decisions.\u201d", "description": "Dudley\u2019s original op-ed generated outrage with experts arguing it could cause \u201cimmediate and serious damage to one of America\u2019s key political institutions.\u201d", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/bill-dudley-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
