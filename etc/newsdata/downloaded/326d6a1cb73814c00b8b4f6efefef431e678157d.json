If he clings to power, a more radicalized Tory party could yet emerge.\n\nBut Mr. Johnson offers little to supporters beyond a promise to leave the European Union next month. His other policies \u2014 tax cuts, more money for the police, tighter immigration rules \u2014 are standard-issue Conservative fare. Several of his rivals for the party leadership this spring ran on substantively similar platforms.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much of a quid pro quo there,\u201d said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Bale noted, a few of the rebels \u2014 notably Philip Hammond, who advocated a policy of austerity as chancellor of the Exchequer in the previous Conservative government \u2014 were put off by Mr. Johnson\u2019s profligate spending plans.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Boris-Johnson-Trump.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
