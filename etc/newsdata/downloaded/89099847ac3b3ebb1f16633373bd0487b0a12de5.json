It was a move that prompted a number of people to share their own travel hacks.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty epic list of hacks. One of my favourites, which actually came up a few times in the responses, was to use a wet towel to combat dry air in the room.\n\nHotel rooms are one place we all tend to crank the AC (or the heat) while we\u2019re there, which can result in some dry air in the room, and potentially a dry throat in the morning.\n\nSeveral people who responded to Klau\u2019s threat offered a simple solution to the problem: wet a towel and place it near the vent.\n\nOne respondent, Jeroen van der Ham suggests putting a wet towel on the drawer on your nightstand to help combat that dry throat in the morning. Another respondent, Aaron B, suggests putting that wet towel instead on the iron board in the room right in front of the room vent.\n\nIn either case, you\u2019ll want to make sure to wring out as much water as possible from the towel before placing it bed or vent-side. The goal here isn\u2019t to create a massive wet spot on your floor. Instead, you\u2019re just creating your own portable humidifier of sorts so the air isn\u2019t quite so dry during your stay, ultimately making that stay just a touch more comfortable.", "description": "Last year, Jeff Darcey blew the internet\u2019s collective mind when he shared his hack for keeping the sun out of his hotel room using a clothes hanger....", "authors": ["Chris Jager", "Brendan Hesse"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/agxehogjvgudgi4mboka.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
