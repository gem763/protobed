She's not one that scares easy, but she knew that wasn't fantasy or part of the act.\n\n\"She said she felt like it wasn't acting and it felt too real. She couldn't get her breath back, she threw up and she was running around trying to find her inhaler when she came in.\"\n\n(Image: liverpoolecho.co.uk)\n\nThe three 15-year-old girls were taken to the Ormskirk attraction on Friday evening by one of the teen's parents.\n\nVisitors can attend different spooky attractions at the event which are populated by role playing actors in scary costumes.\n\nAccording to Farmaggedon's website, visitors must be 15 years old and must provide ID to enter.\n\nThe girl's mother said her daughter had taken her passport to prove her age on Friday.\n\nWhile there, the girls encountered an actor who behaved inappropriately towards them while walking around, the mum said.\n\nHer daughter told a member of staff what happened while there, she added.\n\nShe said: \"She went to one of the stewards and he called over a lady to speak to her. She asked her what happened, and said 'are you okay' before saying she would need to tell her supervisor about it.\n\n\"She also said 'I don't think they're allowed to do that'.\"\n\nThe mother said she feels \"disgusted\" at what happened and said she had put her trust into the age restricted attraction.\n\n(Image: liverpoolecho.co.uk)\n\nShe said: \"I feel sick.
