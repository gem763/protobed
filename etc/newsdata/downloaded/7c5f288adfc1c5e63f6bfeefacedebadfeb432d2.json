Nevertheless, a Jupiter-mass amount of exotic matter is still prohibitively large. In this respect, significant progress still needs to be made to scale the energy requirements down to something more realistic.\n\nThe only foreseeable way to do this is through further advances in quantum physics, quantum mechanics and metamaterials, says Agnew. As for the technical side of things, further progress will need to be made in the creation of superconductors, interferometers, and magnetic generators. And of course, there\u2019s the issue of funding, which is always a challenge when it comes to concepts that are deemed to be \u201cout there\u201d.\n\nBut as Agnew states, that\u2019s not an insurmountable challenge. Considering the progress that has been made so far, there are reason to be positive about the future\u2026", "description": "", "authors": ["Matt Williams", "Universetoday.Com Just-How-Feasible-Is-A-Warp-Drive"], "top_image": ""}
