Will impeachment be any different?", "language": "en", "text": "In Iowa last weekend, the roots of her campaign\u2019s see-saw were clear: It was hard for voters to see Kamala Harris the prosecutor. Harris the presidential candidate was meandering and often indirect, struggling to present a strong argument for her own campaign.\n\nSometimes she captured crowds with a rousing speech; at other times, she circled back to stock phrases that fell flat with audiences, echoing many other candidates in the crowded Democratic field. She offered long, winding answers to questions. She seemed, occasionally, to teeter on exhaustion.\n\n\u201cThe first time I saw her was before she was going to run, when she was asking questions in a hearing. And she was so powerful, I said, \u2018I want that woman to run!\u2019\u201d said Berleen Wobeter, a former educator who came from Toledo, Iowa to see Harris in Cedar Rapids, an hour\u2019s drive away. \u201cSomehow her power doesn\u2019t seem to be coming off like it should. And it makes me sad, very sad.\u201d\n\nWhat would Wobeter want Harris to do differently?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know \u2014 what brings that prosecutor out in her,\u201d Wobeter said. \u201cWhatever it is, I\u2019d like to see that.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Buzzfeednews.Com Article Mollyhensleyclancy Kamala-Harris-Impeachment-Trump"], "top_image": ""}
