Of course! At least in the opinion of various medical professionals who are endlessly interviewed for climate crisis articles. Bad for you. Bad for the environment. Just all around bad.\n\nBut perhaps not. A recent report from an international research team makes the argument that the data simply doesn\u2019t exist to definitively say one way or the other. And they further point out that a lack of exhaustive clinical studies for many related questions plague much of the discussion when it comes to dietary health issues. (10tv.com)\n\nSo is red meat good or bad for you? If the answer were only that simple. A team of international researchers recently rattled the nutrition world by saying there isn\u2019t enough evidence to tell people to cut back on red or processed meat, seemingly contradicting advice from prominent health experts and groups including the American Cancer Society and American Heart Association. But the researchers didn\u2019t say people should eat more meat, or that it\u2019s healthy. No new studies were conducted, and they reported no new understanding of meat\u2019s effects on the body. Instead, the papers offer a new approach to giving advice about food and health \u2014 and a rebuke to how it\u2019s often done.\n\nThis vacillation on dietary guidance isn\u2019t a new phenomenon. If you\u2019ve been following the news for long enough, you probably remember all of the different warnings and retractions we\u2019ve heard about eggs. That one happened so often that the comedian Lewis Black used to work a riff into his standup act about it. Eggs are good. Eggs are bad. The whites are good but the yolks are bad. Make up your mind! I need to make breakfast!\n\nThe studies that are regularly cited about red meat (which the researchers dug into) certainly don\u2019t seem to justify the more dramatic conclusions and warnings. For example, cutting back on red meat in a sample of 1,000 people led to seven fewer cancer deaths. That\u2019s less than one percent. In terms of susceptibility to strokes, there was no difference recorded. Further, even in samples where there was at least some difference, researchers couldn\u2019t rule out the possibility that the difference was caused by unrelated factors.\n\nIn other words, there was little evidence to suggest that eating less meat actually changed your chances of various health outcomes in a statistically significant fashion.\n\nDoes this really come as a surprise? From a strictly non-scientific perspective, humans evolved over time to eat what was available and adapt to those foods just like any other animal. We\u2019ve been hunting animals for food as far back as the anthropological records go. If meat was so toxic to us, how did we survive this long?\n\nIn reality, much like everything else in life, moderation is probably the key. If you eat nothing but bloody red meat three times a day you\u2019ll probably develop problems. The same goes for sugar and all the rest of the selections we eat or drink. And yes, raising beef is probably not great for the planet. But neither is much else that we do. When you\u2019re trying to feed and support a population of nearly eight billion, anything you do on that scale is going to cause issues. But we somehow deal with it and soldier on.", "description": "Is red meat good or bad for you?
