We loved the razor subscription service when we tested it because the razor has incredible mobility that makes it easy to shave any part of the body, and, unlike some subscriptions, it's easy to navigate the ordering process. All this\u2014plus its affordable (in comparison to other razors) price\u2014makes it a great gift for a teen who wants to start shaving but is unsure of what products to get.\n\nGet the Billie Starter Kit for $9\n\n13. For the anxious period-haver: Thinx Fresh Start Period Kit\n\nBest gifts for teen girls 2019: Thinx (Photo: Thinx)\n\nPart of the teenage experience is getting your (menstrual) period in the middle of (academic) third period and having to excuse yourself to the bathroom to wad up some toilet paper in your underwear and pray that it holds up for the rest of the day. Or, at least, it was\u2014until period underwear came along.\n\nWe tested a bunch of period panties and loved Thinx the most, because they absorb menstrual fluid quickly and feel just like a regular pair of underwear. You can gift your teen a regular pair or the Fresh Start Period Kit, which contains three pairs of underwear specifically designed for people between the ages of 9 to 16 in cute, comfy styles.\n\nThis might be a gift better suited to give in private than under the Christmas tree, but, no matter what, it will come in handy.\n\nGet the Fresh Start Period Kit from Thinx for $59\n\n14.

Crew Slim Perfect T-Shirt\n\nBest gifts for teen girls 2019: Slim Perfect Tee (Photo: J. Crew)\n\nA simple-yet-sturdy tee is a fantastic addition to any high schooler or college student's wardrobe, because they can help the wearer look presentable and distinguished without putting in too much effort. We love the Slim Perfect t-shirt from J. Crew because it's soft, opaque\u2014even in white\u2014and has more coverage on the shoulders than most tees, so it's easy to dress up.\n\nGet the Slim Perfect T-Shirt from J. Crew for $29.50\n\n18.

We recommend two from Glossier: Boy Brow, the brand's bestselling eyebrow pomade, which fills in brows without making them look overdone, and the Body Hero duo, which gets you shower gel and lotion in the brand's signature scent.\n\nIt also can't hurt to throw in some Carmex, a lip balm beloved by so-called VSCO girls and at least one of Reviewed's writers.\n\nGet the Body Hero duo from Glossier for $35\n\nGet Boy Brow from Glossier for $16\n\nGet Carmex Lip Balm for $5.54\n\n19.

For the monogram fanatic: Anthropologie monogram necklace\n\nBest gifts for teen girls 2019: Anthropologie monogram necklace (Photo: Anthropologie)\n\nTrends come and go, but monograms are forever. That's why we love this simple block letter monogram necklace from Anthropologie, which allows the wearer to hang a letter\u2014their first name, last name, or that of someone they love\u2014around their neck. The letters hang slightly tilted around the neck, which makes it great for layering with other pieces of jewelry or wearing on its own.\n\nGet the Block Letter Monogram Necklace from Anthropologie for $38\n\n21.
