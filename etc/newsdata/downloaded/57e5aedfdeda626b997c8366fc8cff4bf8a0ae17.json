The gist of the story is that a man bored in his relationship responds to a classified ad that mentions, among other things, the requirement that he must like pi\u00f1a coladas, and he arranges a meeting with the ad\u2019s author at a bar called O\u2019Malley\u2019s. The surprise ending is that the woman he meets is his current partner, which in Holmes\u2019s telling affirms that neither of them had to look outside their relationship at all.\n\nPeople have noted that the song is a little creepy. (The narrator responds to the ad while lying in bed next to its author, for example.) But this episode of Living With Yourself reflects that song to such an uncanny effect that it feels like a straight adaptation \u2014 one that, surprisingly, dignifies Holmes\u2019s lyrics. Kate and Miles 2.0 have placed the modern equivalent to a classified ad in the form of Da8er profiles, and Kate is on the lookout for someone new, who turns out to come in the extremely familiar form of her husband. She also comes to the realization, in the end, that maybe she already has what she\u2019s seeking. (\u201cI\u2019m the love that you\u2019ve looked for, come with me and escape.\u201d)\n\nThe couplet from the song that \u201cPi\u00f1a Colada\u201d most strongly evokes, however, is this one: \u201cI didn\u2019t think about my lady, I know that sounds kind of mean / But me and my old lady, had fallen into the same old dull routine.\u201d Now set aside the creep factor of calling a romantic partner your \u201cold lady\u201d \u2014 though Styx did an entire song around this, which made for maybe the most awkward (yet sweet) scene in all of Freaks and Geeks \u2014 and you\u2019ve got Kate\u2019s marital dilemma in a nutshell. Only the complicated irony of this episode is that hooking up with a more vibrant, energized, \u201cperfect\u201d version of Miles isn\u2019t what she wants, after all. She\u2019s grown past that phase in the relationship.\n\nAfter the last episode peeled off into Miles\u2019s morally dubious salvaging of the Hillston campaign, it\u2019s great to have the show get back to what it does best, which is using its unusual premise to make observations about love, marriage, and the midlife crisis. \u201cPi\u00f1a Colada\u201d starts with Miles 2.0 gathering essential abduction (and killing) materials from a department store before flashing back to a week earlier, when he went on a date with Kate. This picks up right where the Kate-centric fifth episode left off, with the two of them meeting in the city over mimosas and going through the slightly awkward ritual of having a date. With Kate staying at a swanky hotel for a week-long conference \u2014 hence Miles 2.0\u2019s disappearance from work \u2014 they have a chance to get to know each other again. Sort of. It\u2019s obviously complicated.\n\nThe keen insight of this episode is that we never actually want to go back to the early days of a relationship, even if the fantasy of it sounds appealing. We may pine for a time when everything was new and intense and full of spontaneity and possibility, but long-term partnerships change shape over time and certain routines start to take over. That doesn\u2019t sound appealing \u2014 and when your mate is acting like a moody shit, as Miles does most of the time, it isn\u2019t \u2014 but \u201crekindling\u201d the romance can come with its own set of pitfalls. Miles 2.0 may have Miles\u2019s memories, but he doesn\u2019t have Miles\u2019s experience; he\u2019s a shiny new thing who sticks his head out of car windows like a dog. He hasn\u2019t grown together with Kate as comfortable-old-shoe Miles has, and so the two of them are approaching life with a different metabolism.\n\nMiles gets Kate breakfast in bed. He takes her out on a run. He buys tickets for that Paris vacation they\u2019d always wanted \u2014 and even floats the possibility of moving there. But Kate just wants a cup of coffee before work. And she hasn\u2019t been out jogging in a long time. And Miles should certainly have the good sense to realize she\u2019s not up for dropping everything for a trip to Paris, much less a permanent move. He\u2019s coming on way too strong, yes, but mostly he\u2019s \u201cexhausting,\u201d which is a word she uses more than once. \u201cYou\u2019re too great and you\u2019re too loving and you\u2019re too kind and it\u2019s weird,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd a little exhausting, if I\u2019m being honest with you.\u201d Their relationship is just getting started and they\u2019ve already grown apart.\n\nWhat Kate really wants is the slower, more comfortable domestication she already has, but with Miles recommitted to their partnership (and planned parenthood) in a way that he wasn\u2019t pre-cloning. And in his diabolical way, Miles 2.0 comes to understand that, which leads to him planning a kidnapping (and worse) to usurp the old Miles. Who knows better how Miles thinks than another version of Miles, after all? He can muss his hair and mope around, too, if that\u2019s what it takes to be part of Kate\u2019s life. He\u2019ll just have to perform forever without breaking character.\n\nDouble Yous\n\n\u2022 Kidnapper/murderer pro tips: (1) Never buy all your supplies all at once in the same store. If you must, at least throw in a pack of gum or something, and (2) Never test the opacity of a black pillowcase in public.\n\n\u2022 The sex scene between Miles 2.0 and Kate is confusing. It has an awkward beginning and then ends in an abrupt, not-so-satisfactory way. It seems like the show is trying to suggest that Miles 2.0 has the sexual ability and stamina of an inexperienced teenager, but I\u2019m not sure that makes sense. His body may resemble his younger self \u2014 and require him to masturbate multiple times a day accordingly \u2014 but he still has Miles\u2019s memories of how things go.\n\n\u2022 Incidentally, the Miles 2.0/Kate stuff is basically the episode of The Simpsons where Homer tries to save his marriage by getting involved in Marge\u2019s daily routine. (Homer, cutting her hair at the salon: \u201cI wanted to surprise you with a kicky summer \u2019do.\u201d)\n\n\u2022 Hard to believe that any version of Kate and Miles would have done a choreographed number at their wedding.\n\n\u2022 Dan is in on the cloning secret now, but he has an amusingly mixed reaction. He throws up at the sight of his old self buried in a shallow grave, and rages against the spa treatment, given that he \u201cpaid for the silver package.\u201d But he nonetheless wants to be \u201cclone buds\u201d with Miles 2.0 and \u201cbeer it up\u201d with the ladies some time.", "description": "Living With Yourself get back to what it does best: using its unusual premise to make observations about love, marriage, and the midlife crisis.
