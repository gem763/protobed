The movement even floated its own hashtag: #decencypledge.\n\n\u201cI think zero tolerance for sexual harassment, especially egregious sexual harassment, is a completely feasible goal,\u201d Hoffman told MIT Technology Review in a 2017 interview touting his personal reform efforts.\n\nNow, with his name bubbling up in connection with recent revelations about Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s ties to the tech world, Hoffman\u2019s own words may come to haunt him.\n\nIn July, Vanity Fair reported that Hoffman hosted a dinner a few years ago that brought together accused sex trafficker Epstein, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg at a dinner in Palo Alto organized to honor the MIT neuroscientist Ed Boyden. Musk and Zuckerberg distanced themselves from Epstein in comments after the story ran, but Hoffman did not.\n\nThen in late August, the LinkedIn cofounder sprang to the defense of Joi Ito, then the director of the MIT Media Lab, who reportedly concealed donations from the convicted multimillionaire sex offender.\n\nIt happened in a testy email exchange that was revealed by the writer Anand Giridharadas, who served on the selection jury for an award given by the lab. Giridharadas, shaken by the revelations of Ito\u2019s ties to Epstein and on the verge of resignation, wrote to Hoffman, Ito, and his fellow jurors requesting that Ito\u2019s correspondence with Epstein be made public.\n\nIto\u2014who not only cultivated Epstein\u2019s patronage of the Media Lab but also took more than a million dollars for his own personal investments\u2014did not respond to Giridharadas. But Hoffman did: The entrepreneur accused Giridharadas of being dramatic, according to the author. \u201cYour responses frankly make me concerned about your ability to serve on an awards committee,\u201d Hoffman wrote.\n\nWhen Giridharadas said that he would step down if Ito didn\u2019t, Hoffman reportedly accused the writer of making it \u201call about you.\u201d\n\nThat Hoffman was the one to respond surprised him. \u201cWhat I later learned from Ronan Farrow\u2019s reporting was that Joi Ito was more responsive on email to a child rapist like Jeffrey Epstein than to mere me,\u201d Giridharadas told The Daily Beast. \u201cAnother of his plutocratic backers, Reid Hoffman, answered in his place.\u201d\n\nIn light of the responses, the writer stepped down from the jury. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to me that anyone affiliated with Epstein will outlast me on [the jury]. And that you [Hoffman] found time in this thread to attack me before you\u2019ve said one word critical of those who abetted a predatory felon of the worst variety by selling him reflected prestige,\u201d Giridharadas tweeted.\n\nThe exchange with Hoffman left a sour taste in Giridharadas\u2019 mouth.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need Reid Hoffman to make the world a better place or fight sexual harassment. We just need him not to use his power and money to enable a plutocratic predator like Jeffrey Epstein by being the part of the legitimizing of him that occurred after his convictions,\u201d he told The Daily Beast.\n\nGiridharadas declined to share the entire email chain. Hoffman, the MIT Media Lab, and Greylock did not respond to requests for comment on the exchange or on Hoffman\u2019s public commitments against sexual predation.\n\n\u201cI was asking questions about behavior that Joi apologized for. Why is some independent funder answering questions on his behalf?\u201d Giridharadas told the Daily Beast. \u201cThe answer if part of what has grown out of this whole story. These donors are calling the shots over there.\u201d\n\nBy Tuesday, Giridharadas\u2019 name had disappeared from the Disobedience Award\u2019s selection committee website, but Ito\u2019s remained.\n\nITO\u2019S FALL FROM GRACE\n\nIto, an influential figure with a deep Rolodex of contacts in academia and the technology industry, led the MIT Media Lab to global prominence and swelled its coffers with hefty private donations over his eight years as director. He resigned after a New Yorker story revealed Ito had accepted more money from Epstein than previously thought, and made coordinated efforts to conceal these contributions.\n\nA social-climbing money manager who registered as a sex offender after pleading guilty to a prostitution charge in 2008, Epstein killed himself in August in federal jail while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. After his initial conviction and 13 months in jail, he attempted to launder his reputation by donating to and socializing with a wide array of prominent scientists and politicians\n\nThose associates and donation recipients\u2014Hoffman among them\u2014have come under fire in recent months as new allegations surfaced.\n\nRevisiting his \u201cdecency pledge\u201d a year after his initial commitment, Hoffman expanded on his vision, encouraging venture capitalists to \u201crefuse to do business\u201d with sexual harassers. In a blog post, Hoffman rails against \u201cOutrageous and immoral behavior\u201d\u2014a phrase he repeats three times for effect. Hoffman specifically condemns behavior that \u201cignores the power relationship\u201d between two individuals, like a manager and an employee or a VC and a founder.\n\nNews stories heralded Hoffman\u2019s campaign as an idea poised to sow deeper change. \u201cA plea for \u2018decency\u2019 in shaken Silicon Valley,\u201d the BBC headline read. \u201cVenture Capitalists, Tech Leaders Back \u2018Decency Pledge,\u2019\u201d The Information wrote.\n\nDISOBEDIENCE AWARD\n\nHoffman remains close to the MIT Media Lab and funded \u201ca $250,000, no-strings-attached prize\u201d known as the \u201cDisobedience Award.\u201d The principles that form selection criteria for the award are \u201cnon-violence, creativity, courage, and taking responsibility for one\u2019s actions.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, the MIT Media Lab gave one of its honorary orbs, a replica of its \u201cDisobedience Award,\u201d to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nRemarkably, a year later, the Lab gave the award to Tarana Burke, the creator of the hashtag #MeToo, and others who ignited conversations around sexual harassment and gender discrimination in academia.\n\nEthan Zuckerman, a Media Lab faculty member who resigned over the Epstein revelations, was one of the driving forces behind the award, according to The Boston Globe. MIT told the Globe the orb given to Epstein was not a copy of the Disobedience Award but declined to say how it was different.\n\nThe contradiction disgusted Giridharadas, who joined the jury in April and was not involved in selecting last year\u2019s recipients.\n\n\u201cHere you have people who are talking a good game giving award to #MeToo founders, but where they actually have power, which is to decide whether to help legitimize a child rapist who preyed upon young girls, instead of using it to shut him down, they use it to help him come back into society, which, for all we know, helped him continue his crimes,\u201d Giridharadas told The Daily Beast.\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect that Giridharadas was not on the jury that selected Burke for an MIT Media Lab award.", "description": "Reid Hoffman said tech companies should have a zero tolerance for sexual harassment.
