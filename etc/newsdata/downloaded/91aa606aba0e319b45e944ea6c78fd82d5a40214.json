When the contract extension was announced, its chief executive, Professor Ian Chapman, said: \u201cJET has been a shining example of scientific cooperation between EU members, and this news means that these mutually beneficial collaborations will continue, allowing us to do essential experiments on the path to delivering fusion power.\u201d\n\nExperts also poured scorn on Mr Johnson\u2019s claim that Culham was \u201con the verge\u201d of creating commercially viable fusion reactors. The centre\u2019s own website says that electricity produced by nuclear fusion is still \u201c30-40 years\u201d away.\n\nWork on nuclear fusion is seen as highly important because the process could eventually meet the world\u2019s energy needs by providing clean, safe and limitless fuel. A series of crucial tests are due to take place using the JET next year, which will pave the way for further experiments at a new international fusion reactor being built in the southern France.\u200b", "description": "A major UK nuclear laboratory praised by\u00a0Boris Johnson\u00a0in his Conservative conference speech is heavily reliant on EU funding, it has emerged.\u00a0 The prime minister lauded the\u00a0Culham Centre for Fusion Energy\u00a0in Oxfordshire during his address at the gathering, saying the lab \u201ccould soon be the hottest place in the universe\u201d if scientists are able to make a breakthrough in", "authors": ["Benjamin Kentish"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/02/12/boris-speech-6.jpg"}
