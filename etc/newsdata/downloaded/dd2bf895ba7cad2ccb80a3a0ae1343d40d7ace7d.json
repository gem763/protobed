The thought of my children getting on those devices without a helmet on was just absolutely forbidden.'\n\nMr Hodge said he would have 'open discussions' with his children - now aged 17 and 22 - about the 'dangers' of things such as drugs and cars.\n\nSpeaking to the toll of working as a paramedic, Mr Hodge used an analogy to explain how the trauma of an emergency can stay with crew members.\n\n'When you start, they give you a backpack, and every time you do a nasty job, you put a weight into that backpack,' he said.\n\nMr Hodge said working as a paramedic for more than three decades has 'without question' made him fragile and even impacted his parenting strategies.\n\n'Eventually that backpack can get pretty heavy and sometimes for some people unfortunately they can't continue to carry that backpack.'\n\nMr Hodge revealed he had thought about walking away from the career 'more than once' and it was typically during 'moments of panic', like when he thought his helicopter would crash into a hospital while attempting to land.\n\nThe long-term paramedic also spoke about his feelings of 'hate' when called to emergency scenes which shouldn't have happened.\n\n'I just hate the fact that people can have no culpability and have their lives completely changed, it's simply not fair,' he said.\n\n'It's again those messages for young people. Be responsible and that thought ''it's not going to happen to me'' well if you be irresponsible, it will happen to you.'\n\nMr Hodge has written a book about his life on the job, which he described as a cathartic process.\n\nThe book - A Life on the Line - explores Mr Hodge's experiences being caught up in the Bali bombings and working through the Black Saturday fires, among other instances in the paramedic profession.", "description": "Darren Hodge has worked as a paramedic for 32 years and spent the last 15 years\u00a0 serving patients from a helicopter as a\u00a0Mobile Intensive Care Ambulance Flight Paramedic.", "authors": ["Zoe Zaczek For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/05/19772756-0-image-a-8_1571201093769.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
