He\u2019s going up there to be alone, to ponder what it might be like to hurl himself into oblivion, but the implication is this: He\u2019s being watched. The last image of the episode places him on the same terrace again, this time surrounded by great glass partitions that would keep him from jumping, even if his despair summoned the nerve to do it. It\u2019s a reminder that the Roy siblings are still children \u2014 bratty and tempestuous and spoiled, yes, but also vulnerable and easily wounded \u2014 and that their father (and the company) is still putting up guardrails, as all parents do, to make sure they stay safe and understand their limits.\n\nOne of the show\u2019s running themes is how great gobs of money make personal growth nearly impossible, because there can be no consequences for your actions. Kendall has been acting out lately by stealing batteries and candy and vape fluid from convenience stores \u2014 his pathetic way of rebelling, of introducing some small measure of chaos to his now tightly managed life. He can be assured that the company will \u201chandle\u201d this minor misbehavior, just as it handled his impromptu restaging of Chappaquiddick during Shiv\u2019s wedding weekend. The art of good parenting is to know when to take the guardrails away, trusting that your kids have figured out what is and isn\u2019t acceptable, and can know intuitively where the lines are drawn. That\u2019s how they become independent, moral beings who are ready to face the world. Otherwise, they\u2019ll never learn.\n\nThe magic of Succession \u2014 as many have pointed out, including Vulture\u2019s own Kathryn VanArendonk \u2014 is that the folly of the Roy children pivots between tragedy and comedy so fluidly. (And sometimes both at once, like those shots of Kendall getting chauffeured on the back of a motorcycle.) It\u2019s possible to understand, at all times, that the Roys and the Waystar brand are actively working to make the world a worse place to their own extravagant benefit while feeling the full weight of Kendall\u2019s fall from grace. The entire series began with Kendall in the back of a limo, pumping himself up for the company\u2019s acquisition of Vaulter, and now the dominos have come crashing down: his failed vote of no confidence, his failed association with a \u201cbear hug\u201d bid from his father\u2019s most bitter rival, and the unraveling of Vaulter itself, which was mostly just punishment for the other two betrayals. And that\u2019s not to mention his failed marriage and absentee fatherhood or a drug addiction that continues to surge. For a man who has everything, he has nothing \u2014 not even the possibility of leading the company some day, and it\u2019s hard not to empathize with that. Even Shiv, the most calculating and battle-hardened of them all, melts when she realizes he\u2019s crying on her shoulder. \u201cIt ain\u2019t gonna be me,\u201d he says. His most important job now is to keep the father he resents alive.\n\nThe title \u201cSafe Room\u201d refers, in the most literal sense, to an active shooting scare that seems inspired by the bomb threat that cleared out CNN\u2019s New York offices back in December. The sound of a single gunshot is enough to send Waystar executives scrambling to secure locations, though it\u2019s one of the episode\u2019s funniest bits that one safe space is a lavishly appointed panic room and the other is a stripped-down space with bottled water and a window large enough for \u201can attack child\u201d to slip through it. Succession gets a situation like this exactly right: There\u2019s speculation about an active shooter (wrong), likely connected with Antifa (wrong), and possibly targeting a member of the Roy family (wrong), which then allows for ATN to claim it\u2019s under attack, no doubt feeding the worst fears of its endlessly aggrieved viewership. That the shot was actually the suicide of a segment producer is a perfect irony \u2014 that person wound up producing one last segment on the way out.\n\nAmid all the hubbub, Logan and Kendall make headway with a Pierce representative named Rhea Jarrell, played by Holly Hunter, who\u2019s given a proper introduction through a clandestine ride to the underground parking lot. Hunter\u2019s verbal dexterity, honed in unforgettable roles like \u201cEd\u201d McDunnough in Raising Arizona and Jane Craig in Broadcast News, proves ideal for the ornate filth of a typical Succession script. \u201cOn behalf of the Pierce family and the media organization that it\u2019s privately owned for 150 years, the message would be a typically balanced, nuanced, and objective \u2018fuck off\u2019\u201d would sound great coming out of anyone\u2019s mouth, but Hunter has a distinct drawl that puts that extra spin on the ball. The Roys\u2019 overture appears to be successful, or at least successful enough to bring Rhea back into the picture later.\n\n\u201cSafe Room\u201d also affords the opportunity for premium Greg and Tom content. Greg has been hugely uncomfortable with his role as latte-fetcher for Tom at ATN, exacerbated this week by a human Tom employs as a footstool and a possible neo-Nazi who\u2019s become the network\u2019s new rising star. (\u201cATN. Human furniture. Verbal assaults. Physical humiliation. Nazi stuff. Shooters. I just don\u2019t love it.\u201d) The response Greg gets from Tom for suggesting that he move to another arm of the company is pure bruised entitlement, not because Greg is such a great friend, but because he\u2019s the one person in Tom\u2019s world who\u2019s below him on the hierarchy. He only cheers up when Greg blackmails him into getting what he wants, which makes Tom feel like the teacher of a prodigious young student.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking slime ball,\u201d Tom says, beaming with pride. \u201cGood boy.\u201d\n\nSad Sack Wasp Traps\n\n\u2022 Each of this season\u2019s four episodes so far has been structured around a single conceit: the \u201cwinter palace,\u201d Vaulter, the hunting trip, and now the active-shooter scare. It\u2019s helped to hold the multiple ongoing subplots together, just like last season\u2019s episodes around the group-therapy session at Connor\u2019s estate, Tom\u2019s bachelor party, and the two-parter at Shiv and Tom\u2019s wedding.\n\n\u2022 Amazing subplot about Ravenhead, the far-right provocateur who got married at the Nazi congregation site called Eagle\u2019s Nest, named his dog after Hitler\u2019s dog, and participated in a far-right conference in his early 20s. Tom\u2019s attempt to tread lightly over Ravenhead\u2019s past backfires in hilarious fashion when he learns that the would-be conservative broadcaster read Mein Kampf more than once (\u201cAre there Easter eggs in there you didn\u2019t get the first time?\u201d, wonders Tom) and that he doesn\u2019t count Jews among the list of European fatalities during the war.\n\n\u2022 In an episode loaded with great looks \u2014 Tom when Greg tries to blackmail him, Shiv when she realizes Kendall is crying on her shoulder \u2014 J. Smith-Cameron\u2019s expression when Gerri realizes Roman is getting off on her degrading insults is a lusty delight. For Roman, being called \u201cpathetic\u201d and \u201ca revolting little worm\u201d is more authentically arousing than a strained attempt at phone sex with his girlfriend.\n\n\u2022 Roman masquerading in the theme park as Dirk Turkey has serious meme potential. (And if you\u2019re looking for a steady stream of Succession memes on Twitter, the @nocontextroyco account is a must follow.)\n\n\u2022 Frank on Rhea: \u201cShe could be our Coriolanus \u2026\u201d Logan: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take your library card and fuck off.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Connor\u2019s appearance at Mo\u2019s funeral is another highlight, for the \u201c\u2018Mo\u2019 Lester\u201d revelation (\u201cOld Mr. Fiddlesticks, Uncle Meathands. Dad wouldn\u2019t let us in the pool with him\u201d) and the heavily edited eulogy. (\u201cLester was a man. Also, Lester was an employee of the Waystar company for 40 years. And when a man dies, it is sad.\u201d)", "description": "In so many ways, the Roy siblings are still children: bratty and tempestuous and spoiled, yes, but also vulnerable and easily wounded.
