We've agreed a deal to provide Orkambi and other lifesaving cystic fibrosis drugs on the NHS.\n\n'The deal is great value for money for the NHS, and crucially, will improve thousands of lives.\n\n'This deal - on the back of several others this summer - shows why we get some of the best value drugs in the world, and is another reason to be so proud of our NHS.'\n\nCystic fibrosis charities described it as a 'very special day' for patients and their families who have campaigned for years for the drugs.\n\nDavid Ramsden, chief executive at the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, added: 'We know it doesn't end here.\n\n'We will continue to fight for similar access in Wales and Northern Ireland so that all people with cystic fibrosis in the UK are able to benefit from these life-saving drugs.'\n\nDr Caroline Elston, chair of the UK Cystic Fibrosis Medical Association, said: 'We welcome this amazing progress in England, and look forward to receiving further details on how this will be rolled out by NHS England, and what this means for people with CF in Northern Ireland and Wales.'\n\nLast month NHS bosses accused the US pharmaceutical firm of being greedy with its 'monopoly pricing'.\n\nNegotiations had been at a standstill since Vertex this year rejected an offer of \u00a3500million over five years for access to the drug.\n\nThe argument flared up again when the Scottish government announced it had managed to reach a deal last month - enabling the supply of the drugs to 350 cystic fibrosis patients north of the border.\n\nCystic fibrosis is a debilitating illness, which creates a mucus build-up that causes chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage.\n\nThe incurable disease affects around 70,000 people worldwide, including 3,000 in the UK, according to figures.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock hailed the news as 'wonderful' and said the drugs will 'improve thousands of lives'\n\nWHAT IS CYSTIC FIBROSIS? Cystic fibrosis is an incurable genetic disease that affects around 70,000 people worldwide. A defective gene causes a build-up of mucus in the airways, making it increasingly difficult to breathe over time. Mucus also blocks the natural release of digestive enzymes, meaning the body does not break down food as it should. Signs and symptoms: A persistent cough that produces thick mucus (sputum)\n\nWheezing\n\nBreathlessness\n\nExercise intolerance\n\nRepeated lung infections\n\nInflamed nasal passages or a stuffy nose While healthy people cough naturally, that does not happen for people with CF. Eventually, lung function depletes to the point that sufferers will need a double lung transplant to survive. Source: Cystic Fibrosis Foundation\n\nNHS England chief executive Simon Stevens described the deal as a 'long hoped-for moment'.\n\nHe added: 'The UK has the second highest prevalence of cystic fibrosis of any country in the world, so today is an important and long hoped for moment for children and adults living with cystic fibrosis.\n\n'That fact also means that any drug company wanting to succeed commercially in this field needs to work constructively with the NHS.\n\n'I'm pleased that Vertex has now agreed a deal that is good for our patients and fair to British taxpayers.'\n\nOrkambi, which was licensed in Europe in November 2015, is used to treat cystic fibrosis in patients aged two and older while Symkevi treats those aged 12 and up.\n\nThe medications target the F508del gene mutation, which affects about 50 per cent of all people with cystic fibrosis.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the deal was a victory for campaigners who 'stand together and take on the powerful'.\n\nHe tweeted: 'This is life changing for everyone with cystic fibrosis in our country, they've waited years for this drug.\n\n'A victory for all the campaigners who have taken on big pharmaceutical companies' greed and Government inaction. When we stand together and take on the powerful, we win.'\n\nIt comes after more than 117,000 people signed a petition calling on the Government to make Orkambi available on the NHS.", "description": "Up to 5,000 patients in England will benefit from the \u00a3104,000-a-year medications Orkambi and Symkevi following the deal with Boston-based manufacturer Vertex.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/11/18419566-0-The_argument_flared_up_again_yesterday_when_the_Scottish_governm-a-5_1571911406184.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
