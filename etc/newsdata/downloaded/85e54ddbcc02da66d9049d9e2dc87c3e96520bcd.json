Fear of violence, imprisonment and loss of jobs means few gays in Africa come out.\n\nIt\u2019s almost a year since a constitutional court overturned legislation that would have strengthened punishments for anyone caught having gay sex. Influential evangelical pastors have urged Ugandan legislators to reintroduce the law since it was quashed.\n\nOn Saturday August 8 members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community in Uganda celebrate Gay Pride near the capital Kampala. It\u2019s a community that still largely lives in the shadows. A march took place in an undisclosed location, with people holding information posters and playing music about being gay in Uganda. They kept the exact location under wraps because of concerns about safety.\n\nThe LGBT people I met during this assignment were humble, energetic, honest, hardworking and full of life. Most were aged between 23 and 30.\n\n\u201cBad Black\", pictured above, who was born male but prefers to be identified as a trans-woman, stood out for me. Despite the daily barrage of insults because of her feminine style of dressing, she still manages to make friends around her amid a climate of hate.\n\nTime and again I heard from people without jobs because they got fired once their sexuality was in the open. Most of those I met were rejected by their families and sent away. Others still live at home but are in hiding.\n\nShooting such an assignment was delicate. It was a challenge to put together a story that gives some context about the community and their day-to-day lives. I was limited to shooting in isolated areas and mostly inside to protect the people portrayed.\n\nI was working in an extremely difficult environment not least because the stories of many of these incredible people were hard to comprehend. Driven out of home at tender ages, many had to navigate homelessness and abuse. Most of those I met were facing difficult personal struggles, dealing with family rejection and contending with a homophobic community all around them.\n\nRihana, who identifies as a trans-woman, poses for a picture outside her house in an undisclosed suburb of Kampala. While homosexuality is illegal in Uganda, many in the LGBT community are more afraid of hostility from their next-door neighbours than from the law. Those who have found places to live are always afraid of who notices them and how the general wider community reacts.\n\nThe solidarity among the LGBT community in Uganda is very strong. Many of those I met are searching to affirm their identity and looking for people they can identify with. Members of the LGBT community in Uganda generally live and hang out together. In spite of everything, I kept hearing that this year\u2019s Gay Pride would be an act of celebration.\n\n\u201cI will travel around the country to educate Ugandans about our rights,\u201d said Mahad, who identifies as a trans-woman, after she was announced as the winner of Miss Pride beauty contest. The overturn of more draconian legislation last year was an important victory, one of many the LGBT community hopes to fight for and win in the future. U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s vocal support for gay rights in Africa has given them an extra pinch of encouragement and zeal to fight repressive laws. Participants in Pride are hopeful that, with time, fellow Ugandans come to accept them as their brothers and sisters.", "description": "Homosexuality is taboo in almost all African countries and illegal in most including Uganda, where rights groups say gay people have long risked jail.
