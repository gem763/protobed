This was due to solid performance of the canned fish business, driven by good volume growth supplemented by production efficiencies in local canneries which offset US dollar-based procurement costs, it said.\n\nAccording to the statement, the group benefited from a reduced tax charge due to the once-off deferred tax adjustment following a reduction in the federal corporate tax rate in the US, from 35% to 21%.\n\nIt added that \"marginally improved\" fishmeal and oil pricing had also helped, as well as a reduction in the group's interest charge due to debt repayments and \"good working capital utilisation\".\n\nThere was, however, a once-off negative impact from strategic rationalisation of underperforming Angolan businesses, Oceana said.\n\nAccording to the statement, earnings per share for the year are expected to decrease between 27% and 31% to between 536.2 cents per share and 506.9 cents per share. Diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to decrease between 27% and 31% to between 492.5 cents per share and 465.5 cents per share, compared to the previous year.", "description": "Fishing company Oceana Group, which produces Lucky Star pilchards, says it expects a steep drop in headline earnings per share when it releases its financial results for the year ended 30 September.", "authors": ["Sibongile Khumalo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2458/faf788770b6049d6a7eaf38356b891dd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
