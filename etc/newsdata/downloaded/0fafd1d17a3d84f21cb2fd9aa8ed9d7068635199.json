The Moon moves into your romance and pleasure zone for the next few days, bringing good vibes and amorous moments to the fore. Focus on what you love at the exclusion of all else; just for a few hours at least.\n\nSee all daily horoscopes\n\nLibra monthly horoscope\n\nBookmark this page to easily find your daily horoscope!\n\nSunday 06, October\n\nThe communication planet opposes the planet of radical change early tomorrow morning, and some intense energy is building up this Sunday. If you feel stressed or edgy, especially about money and shared resources, don't make any sudden moves. It'll pass in a few days.\n\nSaturday 05, October\n\nWith the Moon in Capricorn this Saturday, you're all about being a domestic goddess. Lunar energy is flooding your home zone for the next few days, so spending time in your private sanctuary is highly recommended. It's great for connecting with your family or just chilling on the sofa and streaming your favourite shows.\n\nFriday 04, October\n\nWith Mars, the planet of passion and action, moving into your own stars today, you get a free pass to pursue your desires. The stars insist that you feel the depths of what you want, Libra - without holding back at all. Don't let anyone tell you that you're too much.\n\nThursday 03, October\n\nMercury leaves your sign and slips into your money zone today, just as Pluto goes direct in your house of home. There's a renewed and very practical focus on your finances in the next few weeks, but at an even deeper level, your family connections and ancestral ties are really speaking to you now.\n\nWednesday 02, October\n\nThe Moon moves into your communication zone today and opens doors for deeper understanding. You can get to both the brass tacks and the deeper philosophical foundations of most matters, Libra. Use the next few days to get your message across, because people are listening to you now.\n\nTuesday 01, October\n\nThe Moon is in your money zone again today, and your focus turns toward what you want to magnetize. With your ruler Venus still lingering in a square to powerful Pluto, everything continues to feel profoundly powerful and possibly a bit overwhelming. Give yourself a break if you need it, birthday bb.\n\nLibra 2018\n\n\n\nLibra personality profile\n\nDaily horoscopes supplied exclusively to Elle UK by the Saturn Sisters\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "24 September - 23 October", "authors": ["The Saturn Sisters"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zB1t32PaCB60qJBiWwu0Rg--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_865/a7d7c5f5799f972340aa7f35eeffaeea", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
