As a general rule that\u2019s true, with depreciation eating up thousands of pounds of the price you paid.\n\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t have to be the case. Savvy buyers can pick up cars that might not only retain their value, but could be sold for more down the line. Get lucky, and the rise in value will cover the cost of motoring over your ownership period.\n\nIn our new Cash Cars column Tony Middlehurst looks for models that might fit the bill. In this one it is the Mercedes-Benz R129 SL\u2026 but first meet Uncle Bob.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz SL of the 1990s was codenamed the R129 and is quietly starting to command attention as a modern classic - which could mean appreciation and free motoring\n\nYears ago, my Uncle Bob built up a sizeable collection of vinyl LPs. For some reason, he sold it for buttons. Realising he had made a terrible mistake, he then bought the whole lot all over again.\n\nThat was an expensive lesson \u2013 which makes it all the more surprising that he then sold his second collection, also for buttons.\n\nAt that point he realised that he was probably too impulsive to assemble a third record collection, and that he should perhaps instead stick to his first love: making money out of cars.\n\nNot as a used car salesman, though. Bob is an odd bloke, but he\u2019s not that odd. He knows there\u2019s no dosh in peddling mainstream motors.\n\nInstead, Uncle Bob does the motoring equivalent of investing in good wine long before the bottles are coveted. He only buys cars that he is fairly sure will rise in value, so that they not only cost him no money between purchase and resale but may even make him a few bob.\n\nBob\u2019s road to free or even money-making motoring is open to all, but you have to follow the rules.\n\nRight now you\u2019re probably thinking \u2018but I don\u2019t want a classic car and I can\u2019t afford an expensive one\u2019.\n\nDon\u2019t worry: you don\u2019t have to be able to buy an E-Type, or restrict yourself to a wheezy old Ford Escort 1.3, flat-batteried MG, or Citroen 2CV to play this game.\n\nNor do you have to be minted. You can do a Bob with relatively new modern classic motors and with affordable but interesting cars whose depreciation curves have long since bottomed out.\n\nYou just need to know what you're doing.\n\nWe\u2019ll talk about a few of Bob\u2019s tricks of the trade over the coming weeks \u2013 recognising the value of a badge, spotting economic trends, knowing the price of eggs, that sort of thing.\n\nFor his first offering though, Bob is going down the useable classic route with a seriously underrated German sportster.\n\nAfter his unfortunate record collection experience, Bob had a tattoo done so that he would never again forget one key principle: you don\u2019t miss anything until it\u2019s gone. That principle applies in motoring, even on everyday \u2018series\u2019 cars like the VW Golf or the 3 Series BMW.\n\nEveryone looks back at old Golfs with a tear in the eye and wishes they were still around, what with the newer ones being far too heavy and generally rubbish etc. The reality is different. Bob knows that every new model of Golf has been dynamically superior to the model it superseded.\n\nNot so long ago you could buy a Mark 1 Golf GTI for peanuts, now decent cars fetch more than \u00a310,000 and the best are even more expensive\n\nSo, how do you play the \u2018drive an interesting car for free\u2019 game with a Golf?\n\nWell, Mark 1s are already too expensive, and Mark 2s are getting that way, so Bob is quietly hoovering up low-mileage but special examples of the universally hated Mark 3 Golf in the cold-eyed certainty that he will be quids in when the number of roadworthy examples drops to an acceptable level.\n\nThe Mark 3 Golf won\u2019t be remembered as fondly as others, but there are plenty of people who prefer it to the Mark 4 and there will always be some who want a GTI or VR6 - and they are getting quite hard to come by.\n\nNow apply this gradual extinction idea to \u2018series\u2019 cars that were rather more expensive than the Golf, but equally unloved in period. It doesn\u2019t take a visionary to realise that there is real money to be made.\n\nRogues, rakes and retirees have been cruising Mercedes SLs along the world\u2019s posher boulevards since 1954. The first W198/W121 cars were pretty exclusive and extremely expensive, both then and now - especially if you\u2019re talking about the cutting-edge 3.0-litre gullwing 300 SL.\n\nThe subsequent W113 \u2018Pagoda\u2019 SL of 1963 to 1971 was an extremely elegant design, but once again the only ones worth having today will have all had plenty of price-hoicking restoration work done on them, so they are of no interest to Bob or us.\n\nThe R107 era Mercedes SL is now considered a bonafide classic and prices have risen substantially in recent years\n\nThe 1972 to 1989 R107 is also too pricey now, classic car dealers having managed to convince today\u2019s market of its greatness, via the liberal application of important sounding but meaningless words like \u2018timeless\u2019. The funny thing about the blocky R107, though, is that it was never much loved in its own lifetime.\n\nWhich brings us to the R129 Mercedes SL, built between 1989 and 2001. There is a popular view that the R129 is too slabby and boring to be worth buying.\n\nForget that. People said all that and worse about the R107, but nowadays even \u2018full restoration needed\u2019 R107s rarely dip below \u00a37,000. Vaguely useable specimens are \u00a315,000, low-mile cars \u00a340,000 and above.\n\nNot only was the R129 a much more accomplished drive than its predecessor, the 200,000-plus examples made mean that it is considerably cheaper to find and buy one.\n\nThe R129 was in the Mercedes range in the late 1990s and early 2000s when the company went through the most damaging period in its history. A shareholder-driven switch to cheaper steels combined with the arrival of thin, easily-lifting waterbased eco paints created just the right conditions for corrosion.\n\nInterestingly, however, the R129 seems to have escaped this blight. It didn\u2019t suffer anywhere near as much from rust as most other Mercedes did at that time.\n\nThe R129 SL dodged a lot of the bodywork problems that Mercedes of the era suffered from\n\nThis body integrity is bothersome from Bob\u2019s point of view, as it delays the onset of profit driven by scarcity, but that won\u2019t last and it\u2019s probably better not to play the rustbucket lottery anyway.\n\nMercedes built 204,000 R129s, but there are fewer than 4,000 of any model left on UK roads today, and for most models the numbers are way below 100. The \u2018miss it and it\u2019s gone\u2019 syndrome is now kicking in, with R129 prices already overtaking those of the later (2002 to 2011) R230 SL.\n\nA good pointer for cars that are ready to do some appreciating is when their appearances start accelerating in the classic magazines. The R129 is doing that at the moment.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the clincher for the R129\u2019s bright future. In 2020, Mercedes will be launching a new version of its evergreen SL roadster.\n\nThe reason this is great news isn\u2019t so much to do with the new model but more to do with the effect its arrival will have on the prices of old SLs, and in particular the so-far ignored R129.\n\nBob reckons the 2020 SL will be about as exciting to look at as a wet haddock. By the time you discover he was right, it\u2019ll be way too late to grab an R129.\n\nMercedes SL R129: Bob\u2019s three to think on\n\nOnce, the V8-powered SL500 was the only R129 to have, but attitudes towards conspicuous consumption have changed. Anyone who has tried the SL300 or 320 six cylinder and the gruntier but also heavier SL500 V8 will know that there\u2019s little between them from a driving perspective.\n\nAcceptable R129s start at \u00a35,000, but low-miler cars are the ones to go for. As long as you keep the annual mileage sensible, values will overcome depreciation.\n\nGood SL500s come in at around \u00a310,000, but sub-50,000 mile cars are currently being advertised by dealers at \u00a325,000 to \u00a330,000. This gap between prices tells you that there\u2019s enough financial headroom to buy one at the lower end of the range and enjoy it for as long as you like before passing it on at a profit to the next lucky owner.\n\nHere are three R129s Bob is looking hard at just now. See if you can beat him to the punch.\n\nThis Mercedes 320 SL with 112,000 miles is for sale privately on Pistonheads for \u00a36,750\n\n1993 Mercedes 320 SL, \u00a36,750\n\n\u2018Clean looking\u2019 is an old car dealer\u2019s clich\u00e9, but this 320 SL offered for private sale really does fit that bill. Considering it has done 112,000 miles, the advert photos make it look almost new.\n\nThere\u2019s a fresh MOT \u2013 as in it was done last week \u2013 plus all the old paperwork, and it comes with the removable hard top (and garage stand), plus refurbished alloys, new soft top windows and re-Connollised leather. The owner says they are selling to fund a house deposit.\n\nThis 1995 Mercedes 320 SL has slightly less than 70,000 on the clock and is for sale via a dealer on AutoTrader at \u00a38,500\n\n1995 Mercedes 320 SL, \u00a38,500\n\nThe dealer selling this claims excellent condition. Obviously you\u2019ll need to check that out for yourself carefully, but one big advantage here is the dealer\u2019s three-month warranty.\n\nThis is a middle-to-low miler with 68,800 on the clock. A full service history is offered, and the MOT history looks reasonable.\n\nThis Mercedes 500 SL has done 107,000 miles and is for sale privately on Ebay\n\n1995, Mercedes SL500, \u00a37,500\n\nThere\u2019s a school of thought that says expensive-looking properties in used car ad pics are a good sign. This 107,000-mile 500SL is definitely pulling the nice surroundings trick, but the owner admits they are selling as they live in central London and spending a small fortune on private parking. So, it\u2019s worth investigating whose home it has been snapped outside before you buy on the \u2018nice house, good car\u2019 basis.\n\nNonetheless, the 500SL will always command attention and this one has a fresh MOT, full service in August, tyres less than 2,000 miles old and a new soft top fitted within the last two years.", "description": "Savvy buyers can pick up cars that will may only retain their value, but could be sold for more down the line. in our new Cash Cars column Tony Middlehurst looks for models that fit the bill", "authors": ["Tony Middlehurst For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
