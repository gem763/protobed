New England Patriots (8-0) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 1\n\nThe Patriots are halfway to an unblemished regular season as the defense was dominant again against the Browns and the offense was good enough. But some cracks are evident heading into Sunday night\u2019s game at Baltimore. The run defense was exploited by Cleveland\u2019s Nick Chubb, and kicker Mike Nugent was less than reliable.\n\nAD\n\n2. New Orleans Saints (7-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 2\n\nDrew Brees made his return from thumb surgery and, mostly, looked like his usually reliable self in the victory over the Cardinals. If the Saints go on to accomplish big things, the great work done by Teddy Bridgewater to hold things together while Brees was sidelined should not be forgotten.\n\nAD\n\n3. San Francisco 49ers (7-0) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 3\n\nIt\u2019s time to stop nitpicking about the quality of the 49ers\u2019 opponents so far. They\u2019re just flat-out good, as their dismantling of the Panthers reinforced. They continue to get it done with fairly ordinary passing numbers from QB Jimmy Garoppolo.\n\n4. Green Bay Packers (7-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 4\n\nAD\n\nRemember when wondering whether this Matt LaFleur-Aaron Rodgers pairing was going to work was a thing? It\u2019s not now. Rodgers is back in the MVP conversation, and LaFleur has coached the Packers to top-contender status in the NFC.\n\n5. Baltimore Ravens (5-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 6\n\nThe Ravens return from their bye to host the imposing Patriots on Sunday night. It will be interesting to see if the dual threat of QB Lamar Jackson as a runner and passer will put a dent in the historic greatness of the New England defense.\n\nAD\n\n6. Indianapolis Colts (5-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 7\n\nAdam Vinatieri is back to his old game-winning ways, with the decisive kick against the Broncos. The Colts continue to amaze, piling up the victories even without retired QB Andrew Luck.\n\nAD\n\n7. Minnesota Vikings (6-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 8\n\nKirk Cousins has played splendidly over the past month. But is that another mirage or is that version of Cousins here to stay? It\u2019s an intriguing story line as the Vikings try to elbow their way into the jumbled mess of teams vying for NFC supremacy.\n\n8. Seattle Seahawks (6-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 11\n\nWinning in Atlanta is not exactly a major accomplishment at this point. But the Seahawks certainly weren\u2019t complaining, as they rebounded from the loss at home to the Ravens.\n\n9. Houston Texans (5-3) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 12\n\nThe loss of J.J. Watt to a season-ending torn pectoral muscle is agonizing. If only there was someone around \u2014 like, say, Jadeveon Clowney \u2014 to pick up the slack on defense.\n\n10. Los Angeles Rams (5-3) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 13\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBeing the NFL\u2019s best third-place team doesn\u2019t completely change the fact that you\u2019re still a third-place team. Beating the Bengals in London keeps things from getting worse for the Rams but shouldn\u2019t convince anyone that they\u2019re back to being what they were expected to be. At least not yet.\n\n11. Kansas City Chiefs (5-3) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 10\n\nThe Chiefs showed Sunday night against the Packers, with Matt Moore filling in capably at QB, that they can be competitive against a good team without Patrick Mahomes. But they didn\u2019t show that they can beat a good team without Mahomes. Still, this is about the big picture. The Chiefs need to be very careful with Mahomes, protect him from himself and make certain that he doesn\u2019t put his future at risk by coming back too soon from his dislocated kneecap.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n12. Dallas Cowboys (4-3) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 14\n\nThe Cowboys return from their bye and simply must beat the Giants on Monday night at the Meadowlands. The schedule toughens after that, with games against the Vikings, Lions, Patriots and Bills.\n\n13. Philadelphia Eagles (4-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 20\n\nThe win at Buffalo was decisive and impressive after all the talk about locker room issues. But the Eagles need to show that they can play like that more often.\n\n14. Buffalo Bills (5-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 5\n\nThe loss at home to the Eagles was alarming. The Bills are a good team if they\u2019re able to play their game without deviating from that script. But when they\u2019re forced to throw the ball, they can\u2019t do it effectively enough.\n\nAD\n\n15. Jacksonville Jaguars (4-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 16\n\nCoach Doug Marrone says he\u2019s not yet thinking about his upcoming QB decision between Gardner Minshew and Nick Foles. That choice is still weeks away. But Minshew\u2019s play certainly is making things interesting.\n\nAD\n\n16. Carolina Panthers (4-3) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 9\n\nKyle Allen had a bad game against the 49ers. The San Francisco defense can do that to a QB. Allen is entitled to one ugly performance, but it does potentially change the dynamics about when Cam Newton might return to the starting lineup.\n\n17. Tennessee Titans (4-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 17\n\nRyan Tannehill, savior of the Titans\u2019 season? Stranger things have happened, haven\u2019t they? Okay, maybe not.\n\nAD\n\n18. Pittsburgh Steelers (3-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 21\n\nIt was an ugly beginning Monday night against the winless Dolphins. But QB Mason Rudolph, RB James Conner and WRs JuJu Smith-Schuster and Diontae Johnson got things going on the way to 27 straight points and a win that moved the Steelers within a game of .500.\n\n19. Detroit Lions (3-3-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 24\n\nAD\n\nThe Lions got back into the win column by beating the Giants. Unfortunately for them, there\u2019s almost no way they\u2019ll catch the Packers and Vikings in the tough NFC North.\n\n20. Los Angeles Chargers (3-5) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 28\n\nThe Chargers finally had something go their way with the Bears\u2019 miss on their would-be game-winning FG. It probably won\u2019t matter, with the Chargers\u2019 season already in such ruins. But you just never know.\n\nAD\n\n21. Arizona Cardinals (3-4-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 15\n\nThe failed fourth-down try by Coach Kliff Kingsbury in the Cardinals\u2019 half of the field Sunday is drawing some criticism. But it was fine. The Cardinals were not going to win in New Orleans by taking a conservative approach.\n\n22. Oakland Raiders (3-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 18\n\nThe Raiders are probably going to have to be satisfied this season with taking a step toward respectability. They\u2019re doing that. Believing that they\u2019ll accomplish more than that is probably unrealistic.\n\nAD\n\n23. Chicago Bears (3-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 19\n\nThere\u2019s just something about the Bears and kickers, isn\u2019t there? Of course, an offense that failed to get touchdowns instead of field goal attempts all day against the Chargers and the passive play-calling at the end of the game didn\u2019t help, either.\n\n24. Cleveland Browns (2-5) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 22\n\nThey have been one of the NFL\u2019s biggest disappointments and they\u2019re well on their way to still being, well, the Browns. Freddie Kitchens is having his issues as a rookie head coach. His team played sloppy and undisciplined football at New England and his two failed instant replay challenges, seemingly based on hope for a good outcome rather than on solid video evidence, didn\u2019t help.\n\n25. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2-5) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 23\n\nBruce Arians came back to coaching for this? Is it too late for him to change his mind?\n\nAD\n\n26. Denver Broncos (2-6) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 25\n\nThere was nothing wrong about what Joe Flacco said in criticizing the Broncos\u2019 lack of offensive aggressiveness. And Flacco, as a former Super Bowl MVP, certainly has the stature to say such things. But he hasn\u2019t played particularly well for Denver, and now he\u2019s sidelined by a neck injury. Maybe if he\u2019d been playing better, the Broncos wouldn\u2019t have been in such a predicament.\n\n27. New York Giants (2-6) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 26\n\nThe initial excitement about rookie Daniel Jones taking over at QB has faded, with Jones committing turnovers in bunches and the Giants on a four-game losing skid. But that\u2019s just how it goes with a rookie QB. At least the Giants, unlike the Redskins, have gotten the development phase underway.\n\n28. New York Jets (1-6) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 27\n\nThe woes continued in Jacksonville. Maybe the Jets should have been less concerned about QB Sam Darnold\u2019s \u201cseeing ghosts\u201d comment getting attention and more concerned about what was causing Darnold to feel that way.\n\n29. Washington Redskins (1-7) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 29\n\nAll those with a grudge against the Redskins, please line up and get ready to take your turn for revenge, right behind Kyle Shanahan and Kirk Cousins. Meanwhile, it\u2019s beyond time to turn to rookie Dwayne Haskins at QB. Give him all the practice reps. Put him on the field. Let him make his mistakes. And start to find out whether he\u2019s the real deal or not.\n\n30. Atlanta Falcons (1-7) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 30\n\nIt\u2019s beginning to feel like it would be an act of kindness if owner Arthur Blank fires Dan Quinn as his coach. This entire situation has become so dreary.\n\n31. Cincinnati Bengals (0-8) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 31\n\nAll those seasons when Marvin Lewis coached the Bengals to the playoffs but couldn\u2019t manage to get a postseason victory don\u2019t seem all that terrible right about now, do they?\n\n32. Miami Dolphins (0-7) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 32\n\nFrom the failed two-point conversion against the Redskins to the lost fourth-quarter lead in Buffalo to the early two-touchdown advantage Monday night in Pittsburgh, the Dolphins have been going off script lately and actually threatening to get a win.", "description": "This week, the Bills plummet with their troubling loss at home to the Eagles, and the Seahawks, Texans and Rams move into the top 10.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4VCw9dQZDxK_An9Ng6HF8Pnea9o=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/227SSSHZSAI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
