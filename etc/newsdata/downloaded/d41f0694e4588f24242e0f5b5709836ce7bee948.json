The show will be streamed on Hot Air\u2019s Facebook page and embedded here and on the show page for those who are not on Facebook.\n\nJoin us as we welcome:\n\nAndrew Malcolm joins us for Tuesdays with Andrew! The Prince of Twitter and I will discuss all of the hot political stories of the day. We will cover the latest on Ukraine-Gate, especially how John Bolton might become a hero \u2014 for Democrats? Chris Hayes called out NBC News for its \u201cconspiracy of silence\u201d over sexual misconduct, which Andrew and I will parse out. Plus, we\u2019ll also talk about our abandonment of an ally in Syria, and perhaps of American honor as well.\n\nAre we in the middle of a massive political realignment? Maybe not, argues Michael Barone. One of the top analysts in politics, Barone discusses his new book How America\u2019s Political Parties Change (And How They Don\u2019t), and reminds us that our two parties are two of the three oldest in the world \u2014 for a reason. We\u2019ll also get a good look at where Barone thinks the next battleground will be.\n\nThe Ed Morrissey Show and its dynamic chatroom can be seen on the permanent TEMS page. Be sure to join us, and don\u2019t forget to keep up with the debate on my Facebook page, too!\n\nHow can Republicans and conservatives keep the momentum going?
