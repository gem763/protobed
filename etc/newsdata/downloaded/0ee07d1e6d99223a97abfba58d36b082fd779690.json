The question is when. (Photo: Fox)\n\nThanks to his first two films, Deadpool already has a pretty wide-open world to play in. With Disney\u2019s purchase of Fox, that world, hypothetically, is about to get a lot bigger.\n\nThat large superhero canvas is very exciting for Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese, who wrote both Deadpool movies and are about to release Zombieland: Double Tap. While promoting that film, io9 asked the duo where their heads were at with a potential Deadpool 3 and the possibilities the Marvel Cinematic Universe may hold.\n\n\u201cThe plan and the hope is that Marvel allows us to continue Deadpool in his R-rated universe that he lives in and also, hopefully over time, we get to play a little bit in the MCU sandbox as well,\u201d Wernick told io9.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all undetermined, though,\u201d added Reese.\n\nWhen io9 then asked about their general ideas, it was obvious they\u2019d thought about it a lot, but probably just couldn\u2019t say that much. Even so, what they said was exciting.\n\n\u201cMarvel\u2019s a rich universe of both heroes and also, wonderfully, villains,\u201d Reese said. \u201cSo we would love to see Deadpool enter that universe in a fun way. It\u2019s just about figuring out how and when.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Plus] Ryan [Reynolds] is very busy and the transition has delayed everything because you just don\u2019t know,\u201d he continued. \u201c[Marvel Studios] is figuring out the next version of the MCU obviously and that\u2019s its own beast. Then you throw Deadpool in there and the X-Men and stuff, and it\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut like Zombieland I think until we land on that one idea we\u2019ll wait,\u201d Wernick added. \u201cIt\u2019s a special project for all of us. And one that deserves a wonderful, great idea. We will continue to trade texts back and forth with Ryan until we land on it, and then my guess is we\u2019ll be off writing soon after that.\u201d\n\nSo answer your texts, Ryan. And the same goes for you too, Kevin Feige.\n\nZombieland: Double Tap is in Australian cinemas October 17 and we\u2019ll have much more on it soon.", "description": "Thanks to his first two films, Deadpool already has a pretty wide-open world to play in.
