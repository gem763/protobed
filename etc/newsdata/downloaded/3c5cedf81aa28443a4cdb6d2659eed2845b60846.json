A lot has changed, including President Trump\u2019s record number of appointments to the circuit courts of appeal.\n\nAmong those who don\u2019t already appear on the list, I would add the following superstars: Third Circuit Judge Stephanos Bibas, Fifth Circuit Judge James Ho, Fifth Circuit Judge Andrew Oldham, D.C. Circuit Judge Neomi Rao, and my dark-horse, Walmart general counsel Rachel Brand (previously associate attorney general, the number-three Justice Department official, and destined for future high office, judicial or otherwise). Of those, the erudite Oldham joins Grant and Wyrick in the \u201chold\u201d pile because he only turned 40 last year.\n\nThat leaves 20 people hailing from all over the country and representing diverse educational backgrounds, with only a handful having graduated from Harvard or Yale law schools. Without any presidential puffery, it\u2019s a terrific list.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ilya Shapiro", "Thefederalist.Com Its-Time-For-Trump-To-Update-His-Supreme-Court-Short-List"], "top_image": ""}
