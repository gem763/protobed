You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut whatever he does, wherever he goes, just doing his best to his nation\u2019s very white saviour, there is his nagging wife \u2013 the nation itself \u2013 who just won\u2019t stop bleating on about Brexit.\n\nHe just wants to get Brexit done, guys. Out of the way, and then get on with the real work, the thing that drives him every day, that inspires him \u2013 more police officers, some hospital improvement works and an administrative tweak to the schools funding model.\n\nThese are the things that have propelled him onward, every day, for thirty years, to get to this very point. And now here he is, standing ready to bring in some more police officers, do some slight improvements to some hospitals, and tweak the schools funding model, but this bloody Brexit thing just will not go away.\n\nOn Tuesday, large numbers of his own MPs are getting ready to side with opposition parties and, as he said, \u201cchop the legs out from under his negotiating strategy\u201d, by trying to stop him dragging the country out of the EU without any kind of deal, and deliver a chaotic, life-chance destroying Brexit of the kind that he always said could never possibly happen.\n\nWhy won\u2019t these people just let him get Brexit over and done with? Why are they persisting with this?\n\nWhy can\u2019t they see that nobody will care about rising food prices, food shortages, fuel shortages, medicine shortages, the collapse of the Good Friday Agreement and the breakup of the United Kingdom once he\u2019s finally, finally, been able to bring in some more police officers, do some hospital improvements and make some administrative tweaks to the schools funding model? That is his vision and Britain is crying out for it.\n\nAnd so he had a warning for his MPs. He gave them this warning by summoning them all to Downing Street, ushering them into the garden, then going out of the front to issue this warning in the street, where none of them could see or hear him. He did this for reasons that may never become clear. Such are the stresses on a man so close to seeing his vision made real but still so agonisingly far.\n\nIndeed who of us can hope to know the intricacies, the subtleties of the man? This Johnson premiership is already arcing out of the reach of mere mortals. Who of us can understand him, this higher life form, this great man, this modern-day Churchill, whose eminent Churchillianism cannot even be held back by his lacking absolutely every single one of Churchill\u2019s qualities?\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Boris, as Churchill may very well have once said, is bollocks, wrapped in bollocks inside bollocks. But there may be a key. That key, is bollocks.\n\nIf you understand that the ultimate point of Johnson\u2019s words are to be meaningless \u2013 as he has absolutely nothing to say, at all, no cause or purpose he wishes to serve beyond his own narcissism \u2013 you can start to balance the bollocks out on both sides of the ledger.\n\nIf MPs vote to block no-deal Brexit on Tuesday, it would, as he said, chop out the legs of the negotiating strategy from under the government. Within two sentences, he added that, if they do compel him to seek to an extension to Article 50, he would just ignore it. So the thing that he expects you to believe will derail his negotiation, he will also just ignore.\n\nThe EU need to believe we are serious about coming out without a deal. He said this for approximately, the ten thousandth time, otherwise the negotiations \u201ccannot move forward\u201d.\n\nThe negotiations that \u201ccannot move forward\u201d have already finished. The new \u201cproposals\u201d that have apparently moved them forward were, we are told, shown to MPs in Downing Street, by Boris Johnson. One such MP has claimed that they are the same as the old proposals, but with the bits about the backstop crossed out.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want an election, the people don\u2019t want an election,\u201d he said, by way of threatening to hold one within six weeks if he doesn\u2019t get his way. In the Westminster village, a long day\u2019s election speculation ended without the production of a single poll that intimates a general election will improve his fortunes in the slightest.\n\nIs it, at this point, perhaps possible to wonder if all this could be a little disappointing, if not unsettling, for the 17 million or so people that voted for Brexit? The country has waited patiently for all Brexit\u2019s many promised glories to become real, but before it has even happened, the man who promised it to them now talks of it as little more than an inconvenience.\n\nBecause Boris Johnson has been prime minister for five weeks now, and he campaigned to become prime minister for even longer than that. And during that entire time, not once has he uttered a single positive syllable about what Brexit might actually have to offer.\n\nIt must simply be got over and done with. It must be \u201cpacified\u201d. The bawling baby must be put to bed.\n\nThe leading Brexiteer is now prime minister, and all he appears to want to do, in this post-Brexit nirvana, he will soon have built, is bring in some more police officers and, well, you know the rest.\n\nIs it possible, just dimly possible, that it might be starting to look like something of a con?\n\nAnd when that con becomes glaringly real, it might just be that 20,000 new police officers won\u2019t be enough.", "description": "If it was what he\u00a0was going for then, in\u00a0fairness to the prime minister, it was the best impression of David Brent that\u2019s ever been attempted outside the\u00a0front of the door of 10 Downing Street.
