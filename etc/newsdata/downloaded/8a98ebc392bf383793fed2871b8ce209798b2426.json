Getty\n\nIn a stroke of strategy genius, Taronga Zoo has found a way to help tourists do it in style and all in the one hit - albeit they'll want to be relatively well-heeled with prices starting at $790 a night for two people to experience Sydney's top four.\n\nOn Thursday, following a two-year build program, the zoo unveiled its $44.5 million Wildlife Retreat, comprising 62 rooms built across five environmentally sensitive lodges - with many of the rooms offering both zoo and gun-barrel harbour views.\n\nThere's also a lodge \"nest\" or clubhouse for drinks and canapes, as well as a fine dining restaurant, with both facilities only available to retreat guests and boasting among the best views in Sydney.", "description": "Taronga Zoo's 62 environmentally sensitive, luxury rooms are destined to be a hit with locals and tourists alike.
