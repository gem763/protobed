Granzier, who has a YouTube channel under his first name with more than 730,000 followers, informed deputies that he was a YouTuber, the sheriff\u2019s office said.\n\nAfter both consented to a search of camera equipment in their vehicle, officers discovered footage they\u2019d recorded while trespassing on the restricted government property.\n\nThe arrests come just a week before the ill-fated \u201cStorm Area 51, They Can\u2019t Stop All of Us\u201d joke Facebook event, which morphed into possibly cancelled four-day Alienstock that was slated to take place in Rachel, Nevada.\n\nThe original event organiser \u2014 who pulled out of the event this week over concerns it would play out like a Fyre Fest 2.0, as Rachel does not have the infrastructure to support such an event \u2014 has since announced a separate event will take place next week in downtown Las Vegas on September 20.\n\nHowever, Connie West, owner of the Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn in Rachel, said in an interview this week that the plans for the original festival will move forward. BuzzFeed News quoted Lincoln County Sheriff Kerry Lee as saying the area still expects \u201cnumerous people\u201d to show up.\n\nIn an interview with ABC-affiliated KTNV Las Vegas from the Nye County Detention Centre, Sweep said that the two knew of the event and that it was part of the reason they\u2019d decided to visit the area. However, Sweep noted that he and Granzier didn\u2019t \u201chave any intention to storm it because we leave one day before the actual storming event.\u201d\n\nSweep told the outlet that he and Granzier are scheduled to return to the Netherlands on September 20, adding that they still hope to visit Route 66 and Los Angeles before they return home. He further said that the two \u201cdon\u2019t want to spend every day in jail here.\u201d A spokesperson for the sheriff\u2019s office told Gizmodo the two were still in custody as of Thursday.", "description": "Nevada police say they arrested a YouTuber and his friend, both from the Netherlands, this week after the pair allegedly defied notices and trespassed at a secure government site near Area 51....", "authors": ["Andrew Liszewski", "Beth Elderkin"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/y8wsj1oyqirhkmfn0hji.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
