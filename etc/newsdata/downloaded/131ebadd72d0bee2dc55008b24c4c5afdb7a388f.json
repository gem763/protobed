The goal? To connect businesses and individual art buyers with collections by a global field of artists, some of whose work specifically speaks to serious environmental threats facing the planet.\n\nAlpha\u2019a started small before growing into an international digital art hub. Seve and Thom\u00e9 founded their company in 2014 in Rio de Janeiro, launching officially in the form of a T-shirt competition at ArtRio, one of Brazil\u2019s main art fairs. Over the next few years, they grew their platform into a network that would eventually include 7,000 different artists and businesses around the world.\n\nOnce they moved to New York two years ago, the two entrepreneurs built the platform to look as it does now\u2014a crowdsource-driven approach to finding new artists, with users voting on works that will become available for purchase, giving them the option to create customized art collections. They see this as a way to appeal to technologically savvy clientele, democratizing and modernizing the art acquisition process that can at times seem stuffy and remote to younger consumers.\n\n\u201cAlpha\u2019a works exclusively with limited-edition prints from artists from all over the world, which means that, even though we sell actual collectible works of art, working with editions creates more accessible price points due to how editions are proportionally priced to original works divided by the size of the total production,\u201d says Seve, Alpha\u2019a\u2019s founder and CEO.\n\nThom\u00e9, the company\u2019s partner and COO, adds that this brings about a supply-and-demand approach to pricing art.\n\nBeyond the central conceit behind their business model is a dedication to environmental activism. Once they moved to the U.S., Thom\u00e9 and Seve started the \u201cArtivism Challenge,\u201d partnering with NGOs to host a competition that sees artists creating works that address a pressing environmental issue. Proceeds go to ecological protection efforts.\n\nThis year, Alpha\u2019a is working directly with RainForest Alliance, with all profits of specific works available right now going to the nonprofit for its conservation efforts to protect the endangered Amazon.\n\nTHE ITEM\n\nIf you take a look through Alpha\u2019a, you\u2019ll see a wide array of styles and mediums. The art featured on the platform ranges from traditional paintings to mixed media collage to sharp, striking photography and portraiture. As of publication, there are just under 530 items available for sale on the site.\n\nWhen it comes to the significance of the work featured on their platform, Alpha\u2019a\u2019s founders see their artists as introducing more consumers to fine art while also using their creativity to spotlight important issues facing the globe.\n\n\u201cArt has the power to easily convey messaging, the first step is to create awareness, but if we rely solely on graphic imagery, humans feel detached from the problem,\u201d Seve says. \u201cWhen one creates a positive outlook and personal bonds with the message, the viewer is engaged to participate in the solution, when we are able to educate audiences that our choices do matter, especially when it comes to meat consumption and the current problem in the Amazon, a snowball effect can be created.\u201d\n\nPRICE\n\nThe art for sale on Alpha\u2019a ranges from pieces as low as $100 to $120, up to those ranging from $1,500 to $1,900.\n\nEliseu Cavalcante is one of the artists whose work will benefit RainForest Alliance. Eliseu Cavalcante\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nBoth Seve and Thom\u00e9 approached their business from completely different places. On one hand, Seve grew up with art\u2014her father is an art dealer while her mother is an artist. Their family owns one of the oldest galleries in Brazil, she says.\n\nDespite this creative background, she worked in finance, serving as an equity analyst at G\u00e1vea Investment, a Brazilian investment management firm.\n\nOn the other hand, Thom\u00e9 says she had \u201cno familiarity with the arts until later in life.\u201d Her first encounter with the art world came when she moved to New York for the first time in 2011, working briefly at a gallery.\n\n\u201cI realized I was very passionate about the subject, but lacked technical training and because of that, I decided to do a Masters at Christie\u2019s Education,\u201d Thom\u00e9 adds. Eventually, she worked for the David Zwirner gallery in New York and was an art consultant for online auction house Paddle8.\n\nSeve\u2019s family background and financial training complemented Thom\u00e9\u2019s expertise. They say this meld of talents has enabled them to work well with their artists while also creating an online space that\u2019s relatable to their consumer base.\n\nWHAT\u2019S THE GOOD?\n\nTwo years ago when they started the Artivism Challenge, Thom\u00e9 and Seve partnered with Oceanic Global, a nonprofit dedicated to ocean conservation efforts. This year\u2019s collaboration with RainForest Alliance is particularly timely given the near-daily headlines about forest fires ravaging the Amazon.\n\nThom\u00e9 says that \u201cde-regulation in Brazil has led to a dangerous negative tipping point in the state of the Amazon\u201d and that it is now up to the \u201cpower of private organizations,\u201d as opposed to governments, to save the diverse ecosystem of the rainforests.\n\nEliseu Cavalcante is one of the artists whose work will benefit RainForest Alliance. Cavalcante \u2019s pieces will be shown alongside others in a pop-up gallery during New York\u2019s Climate Change Week later this month.\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\n\nAlpha\u2019a has only existed in its current form for two years, and its founders see room for continued growth, especially in spotlighting environmental causes.\n\n\u201cWe expect to continue organizing more of such initiatives surrounding social and environmental causes in the future, and eventually find private companies to support changes envisioned by Alpha\u2019a artists into real life problems,\u201d Seve says.\n\nThom\u00e9 adds that this partnership between companies, NGOs, and \u201cdreamers\u201d who love art will \u201cfacilitate real-world change.\u201d", "description": "The New York-based company connects 7,000 different artists and businesses around the world", "authors": ["Brian Mastroianni"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-106615/social"}
