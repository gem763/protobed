And that\u2019s an example of anti-competitive behavior.\u201d\n\nSpiegel also confirmed that the company had put together a list of some of Facebook\u2019s competitive moments called Project Voldemort, noting that the list had been started several years ago. The initiative\u2019s existence was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make it, our legal team put it together,\u201d Spiegel said. \u201cI think just because they kept hearing from our partners all of these things that Facebook was doing and it was actually so many that people couldn\u2019t actually remember them all so they started writing them down.\u201d", "description": "Facebook\u2019s relentless feature copy of Snapchat has been seen as one of the chief examples of the company\u2019s competitive overreach, but Snap CEO Evan Spiegel isn\u2019t sure whether antitrust activity from the government is going to change the company\u2019s near-term prospects of competing with Instagram. \u201cI mean the history of antitrust would basically say that [\u2026]", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Evan-Spiegel-SnapDSC04002.jpg?w=600", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
