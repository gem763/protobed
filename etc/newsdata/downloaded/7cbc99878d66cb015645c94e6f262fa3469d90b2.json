The weapon is bulky. Its warhead is probably small compared to other missile types.\n\nIsrael Aerospace Industries and Israel Military Industry Systems announced in June 2018 they had tested, from an F-16, the 15-feet-long, 1,200-pound, GPS-guided Rampage \u2014 and had already inked a sale contract with one customer, presumably the Israeli air force.\n\nWith Rampage, the Israeli air force could join a slowly growing number of air arms developing ALBMs for non-nuclear attacks. Russia has introduced its own, much larger ALBM. China reportedly is working on one, too.\n\nBut the United States apparently doesn\u2019t see the value in an air-launched ballistic missile. Existing cruise missiles \u2014 which already are available to U.S. forces in very large numbers \u2014 are perfectly capable of striking, in large salvos, a wide range of distant targets.\n\nIAI said speed, range and cost are the ALBM\u2019s main advantages. Eli Reiter, manager of IMI\u2019s firepower division, praised Rampage\u2019s \u201cextraordinary cost-effectiveness ratio\u201d but did not disclose the missile\u2019s cost.\n\n\u201cIt can be detected, but it is very hard to intercept,\u201d Amit Haimovich, director of marketing for IAI\u2019s Malam engineering unit, told The Jerusalem Post.\n\nThe Israeli air force operates a wide range of conventional guided air-to-surface munitions. But none are supersonic. And it\u2019s likely none can match Rampage\u2019s range. \u201cThe whole point of this missile is that it can hit targets within standoff ranges,\u201d Haimovich said.\n\nWhile IAI didn\u2019t specify the new weapon\u2019s reach, a similar but larger Russian weapon reportedly can strike targets as far as 1,200 miles away. It\u2019s reasonable to assume Rampage can travel hundreds of miles.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "How good are they?", "authors": ["David Axe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rZa187.DAAg5X2Nn_4DTOw--~B/aD05NjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/765d86e0ef07a59be34e77de0ad3da55", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
