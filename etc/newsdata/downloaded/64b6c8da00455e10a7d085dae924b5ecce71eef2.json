A \u201cbellwether\u201d trial pitting two Ohio counties \u2014 Summit and Cuyahoga \u2014 against several drug companies is scheduled to begin Oct. 21. Polster chose them as a test of how other lawsuits might fare.\n\n\u201cAcknowledging the immense scope of the opioid crisis, and calling on all entities who have the power to ameliorate it to join me in doing so without delay, does not reflect any bias or prejudice toward any party to the litigation; and no reasonable observer would so conclude,\u201d Polster added.\n\nThe judge noted he has pursued two separate tracks since he was placed in charge of the \u201cmultidistrict litigation,\u201d which has been described as the most complex civil lawsuit in U.S. history. The plaintiffs in the first trial are seeking billions of dollars from seven drug manufacturers and distributors for the deaths and addiction they allege the companies caused. The companies, which include Johnson & Johnson, McKesson Corp. and Walgreens, have denied the accusations.\n\nNeither side can \u201ccredibly complain of my public observations that any settlement will unquestionably require the defendants to pay money to the plaintiffs,\u201d Polster wrote. \u201cThis is simply a fact of litigation, not an expression of bias or prejudice or prejudgment against any defendant.\u201d\n\nMore than 200,000 people have died of overdoses from prescription narcotics since 1999, according to government statistics.\n\nPolster cited what he called the successes of 20 months of settlement efforts, including multi-million dollar agreements between three manufacturers\u2014Endo, Allergan and Mallinckrodt pharmaceutical companies\u2014and the two Ohio counties, which removed those companies from the upcoming trial.\n\nHe also noted the court\u2019s role in helping fashion a proposed settlement between Purdue Pharma and all 2,500 plaintiffs, as well as nearly every state, which have sued Purdue in their own courts. Purdue, the company widely blamed for fueling the drug epidemic, has declared bankruptcy. It has valued its settlement at $10 billion to $12 billion, including at least $3 billion from the Sackler family, who own the company.\n\nThe companies that asked Polster to step down little more than a month before trial said they were prompted by two events. The first was his decision to allow communities nation-wide to take part in a proposed \u201csettlement class. The second was Polster\u2019s ruling that he\u2014not a jury\u2014would decide the size of the monetary award if drug companies were found liable for creating a \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d that harmed the health of residents in Summit and Cuyahoga counties.\n\nPolster refuted both assertions on legal grounds and said neither decision created the appearance of bias on his part. And he noted the impracticality of another judge taking over the sprawling lawsuit just weeks before the first trial begins.\n\n\u201cI freely admit I have been very active from the outset of this MDL in encouraging all sides to consider settlement,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt goes without saying that if even a small fraction of the 2,000 cases in the MDL requires a months-long trial, the federal judiciary will be overwhelmed and most of the defendants would be forced into bankruptcy, simply because of litigation costs.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, the resolution of a social epidemic should be the responsibility of our other two branches of government, but these are not ordinary times,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more\n\nAs lawyers zero in on drug companies, a reckoning may be coming\n\n76 billion opioid pills: Newly released federal data unmasks the epidemic\n\nA federal judge vowed to tackle the opioid crisis.
