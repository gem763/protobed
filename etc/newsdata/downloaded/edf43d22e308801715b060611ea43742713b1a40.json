Referee Celestino Ruiz called off the fight at one minute, 46 seconds of the round.\n\nDay lay on the canvas for several minutes receiving medical treatment before being removed from the ring.\n\nDay is at least the third boxer to die from injuries sustained in the ring this year.\n\nArgentine boxer Hugo Santillan died in July following a bout in San Nicolas, just north of Buenos Aires.\n\nSantillan\u2019s death came just two days after Russian fighter Maxim Dadashev died from brain injuries suffered in a fight in Maryland.\n\nIn his statement on Wednesday, DiBella said he hoped Day\u2019s death would prompt US authorities to adopt tougher safety standards.\n\n\u201cIt becomes very difficult to explain away or justify the dangers of boxing at a time like this,\u201d DiBella said.\n\n\u201cThis is not a time where edicts or pronouncements are appropriate, or the answers are readily available. It is, however, a time for a call to action.\n\n\u201cWhile we don\u2019t have the answers, we certainly know many of the questions, have the means to answer them, and have the opportunity to respond responsibly and accordingly and make boxing safer for all who participate.\u201d", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 American boxer Patrick Day died Wednesday after suffering a serious brain injury during his knockout defeat to Charles Conwell", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/7520e4_patrick-day-exchanging-punches-charles-conwell-in-super-welterweight-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
