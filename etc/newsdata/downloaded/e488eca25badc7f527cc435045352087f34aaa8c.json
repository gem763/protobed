What I find best about him is his parenting skills. He brings her out and turns her back in and stops her.\n\n\"He has this bulky body. He\u2019s very buff. He probably doesn\u2019t have that fluidity but they\u2019re working on it.\"\n\n*It Takes Two airs weekdays on BBC Two at 6.30pm", "description": "The former Strictly Come Dancing professional wowed fans and Rylan Clark Neal with her 'absolutely sensational' appearance", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Bbc", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20668430.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RLP_MDG_18957JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
