General Mazloum Kobani Abdi, commander of the SDF, described the operation as an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to Syria\u2019s Kurds.\n\nThe agreement could spell the end of a years-long experiment in autonomy led by Syria\u2019s Kurds, and marks a major shift in alliances for the embattled community.\n\nTurkey has long threatened to attack the SDF, which it considers a terror organisation for its links to a Kurdish separatist group that has fought the Turkish state for decades. Ankara said its military operation was launched to implement a \u201csafe zone\u201d along its border with Syria, free of SDF fighters.\n\nBut the SDF \u2014 a mostly Kurdish militia with a smaller Arab contingent \u2014 has been a key ally of the US in the fight against Isis. The presence of US troops in Syria alongside the group had acted as a deterrence for a Turkish assault. That changed quickly last week when Donald Trump made a shock announcement that the US would not stand in the way of a Turkey\u2019s plans to enter Syria. The SDF described the abrupt shift as a \u201cstab in the back.\u201d\n\nThe deal will see the Syrian army deployed along a large stretch of the Turkey-Syria border, the SDF said, in an effort to deter any further Turkish incursion.\n\nThe agreement brings its own dangers, however. For decades, Kurds in Syria have faced repression and discrimination at the hands of the government. Although the civil war had caused great upheaval for the community, it has also allowed them to win new freedoms, which may now be lost again.\n\nThe SDF currently controls around a third of Syrian territory in the north and east of the country.\n\nSyria\u2019s Kurds took over control of majority Kurdish areas from the government shortly after the outbreak of Syria\u2019s civil war in 2011, but largely refrained from directly fighting it.\n\nIn the time since, it extended that area of control beyond Kurdish areas as it recaptured territory held by Isis.\n\nOver the past few years it has built an alternative form of governance in the areas under its control, with the eventual aim of creating an autonomous administration that would outlast the war.\n\nRead more\n\nInnocent Syrian civilians being \u2018turned into the fuel of war\u2019\n\nFemale Kurdish politician \u2018executed\u2019 by pro-Turkish militants in Syria\n\nTrump says US will not stand in way of Turkish operation against Kurds\n\nHow Erdogan became \u2018the most practised populist in the world\u2019", "description": "Kurdish-led forces in Syria have struck a deal with Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government to handover areas along the border to the Syrian army in a last ditch effort to halt a Turkish attack.The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, one of the west\u2019s key allies in the fight against Isis, said the army would", "authors": ["Richard Hall"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/d65mIV8LYcRiQePC8bWBDA--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/15569f10fa867158d497eb2a45f14d08", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
