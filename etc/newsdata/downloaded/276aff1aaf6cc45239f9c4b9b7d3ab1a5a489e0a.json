Giuliani, on Tuesday defied a congressional subpoena.\n\nJon Sale, acting as Mr. Giuliani\u2019s counsel, notified lawmakers in a letter that his client would be taking the same position as the Trump administration and refuse to cooperate with House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry until a full authorization vote was held.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the subpoena is overbroad, unduly burdensome and seems documents beyond the scope of legitimate inquiry,\u201d Mr. Sale argued. \u201cMoreover, documents sought in the subpoena are protected by attorney-client, attorney work-product and executive privileges.\u201d\n\nMr. Giuliani stressed that Mr. Sale assisted only with the letter.\n\n\u201cAt this time, I do not need a lawyer,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nI will not participate in an illegitimate, unconstitutional, and baseless \u201cimpeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\n\n\nJon Sale, who is a lifelong friend, has represented me for the sole purpose of analyzing the request and responding. At this time, I do not need a lawyer. pic.twitter.com/l0IR0ikEHD \u2014 Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) October 15, 2019\n\n\n\nThe former New York City mayor has become one of the central figures in the impeachment inquiry, as he worked to push Ukraine to open an investigation into former Vice President and Trump political rival Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter.\n\n\n\nLast week the White House sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warning her that they wouldn\u2019t cooperate with the impeachment probe until she held a full House vote to authorize and establish equal powers for both parties.\n\nHouse Democrats have repeatedly warned that refusing to cooperate would not only serve as more evidence of obstruction of justice \u2014 an impeachable offense \u2014 but also allow them to conclude that the withheld information would corroborate the allegations stemming from a whistleblower report that Mr. Trump solicited Ukraine to investigate the Biden family.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark T. Esper and acting Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought were also subpoenaed to produce by Tuesday documents related to delayed military aid.\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President Pence faced a deadline Tuesday to voluntarily hand over documents related to his involvement in the Ukraine allegations, particularly regarding the aid.\n\nIn a statement, the vice president\u2019s counsel called into question Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s \u201ccommitment to fundamental fairness and due process rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease know that if the committees wish to return to the regular order of legitimate legislative oversight requests, and the committees have appropriate requests for information solely in the custody of the Office of the Vice President, we are prepared to work with you in a manner consistent with well-established bipartisan constitutional protections and a respect for the separation of powers,\u201d the letter read.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
