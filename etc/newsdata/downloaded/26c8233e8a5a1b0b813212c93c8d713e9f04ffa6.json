They also expected a Medicare for All system to decrease overall health care quality and health care delivery innovation.\n\nOn the plus side, the vast majority of employers thought the system would decrease the number of uninsured people in the country.\n\nThey were largely divided on whether it would increase access to health care.\n\nNearly half of all respondents said the program should not be expanded to encompass those below the age of 65, while others supported more modest expansions of the system.\n\nMedicare for All is a divisive issue within the Democratic Party itself. For example, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent Vermont, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from, Massachusetts, support a complete expansion of the program whereby there is no role for the private sector.\n\nOn the other hand, Sen. Kamala Harris, a Democrat from California, does not support getting rid of the role of the private sector entirely.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden has advocated for adding a public option to ObamaCare, as have Sen. Cory Booker, of New Jersey, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Indiana, and former Texas lawmaker, Beto O\u2019Rourke.", "description": "Employers were divided as to whether people would have expanded access to care.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/05/0/0/iStock-Doctor-and-surgeon.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
