One report released this year found that the mayor\u2019s plan compounded residential segregation patterns in the city by giving preferences for affordable housing to those who already live in a neighborhood.\n\nOr how about aggressively pressing forward on a $24 billion overhaul of the city\u2019s decrepit public housing system? A plan to help pay for those repairs by building mixed-income housing on Housing Authority land has stalled.\n\nSimply fulfilling his promise to close the jails on Rikers Island would be a major achievement. So too would a successful campaign to overturn a state law that keeps the disciplinary records of police officers, firefighters and corrections officers secret, known as 50-a.\n\nHizzoner could also spend the next two years aggressively working to desegregate the city\u2019s public schools \u2014 the tiny number of black and Hispanic students in the city\u2019s competitive public high schools is especially galling. Hard work? Sure. It\u2019s also a long-term project that will require support in Albany. But there\u2019s plenty that the mayor can do on his own to help black and Hispanic students enter other top high schools, and to integrate the schools in the earlier grades, where black and Hispanic children are vastly underrepresented in gifted and talented programs.\n\nIf Mr. de Blasio is looking to leave his mark on the physical footprint of the city, he could back a proposal to rebuild a crumbling section of highway along the Brooklyn promenade by covering it with parkland. Department of Transportation officials under Mr. de Blasio had initially proposed a $3 billion-plus plan that would have closed the promenade for years and temporarily replaced it with a six-lane highway. The communities surrounding the promenade balked, and have offered far better solutions.\n\nIf he still wants to make New York America\u2019s \u201cfairest\u201d big city, as he promised in his 2017 campaign, the mayor might consider taking on property tax reform. Homeowners in some of the city\u2019s wealthiest neighborhoods pay little in property taxes, while renters and others bear a greater burden.\n\nOne bright spot is a $100 million effort Mr. de Blasio unveiled this year to transform the city\u2019s public hospital system by focusing it on providing primary care, particularly for low-income and undocumented New Yorkers. If the plan succeeds, that would be something to celebrate.", "description": "It isn\u2019t too late for the mayor to deliver for New York City.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/07/opinion/00deblasioWeb/00deblasioWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
