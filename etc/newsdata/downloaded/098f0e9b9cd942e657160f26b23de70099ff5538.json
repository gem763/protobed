At least 1,100 people have been wounded and 2,200 people have been arrested, Lam said, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap\u2019s Hong Kong correspondent.\n\nLam\u2019s housing proposal could be an attempt to ease tensions in Hong Kong, where residents have criticized the chief executive for lack of transparency.\n\nAs part of Lam\u2019s proposal, about 1,730 acres of unused private land will be set aside and redeveloped for public housing in Hong Kong\u2019s New Territories region. The land is owned by a business conglomerate. Developers typically hoard unused land, driving up real estate prices and causing a housing shortage in the city, according to reports.\n\nLam also proposed education reform on Wednesday. About 900,000 Hong Kong students are to receive an annual grant of about $320 from the city to go toward tuition. Many of the protesters are university students who have demanded transparency from Lam.\n\nThe protests in Hong Kong prompted the U.S. House of Representatives to pass a bill supporting the protesters on Tuesday.\n\nChina criticized the decision early Wednesday, CNBC reported.\n\n\u201cRegarding the wrong decision of the U.S., the Chinese side will have to enact effective countermeasures, firmly safeguard Chinese sovereignty, security and development interests,\u201d Geng Shuang, foreign ministry spokesman, said in reference to the bill.\n\nChina has previously warned the United States to stay out of Hong Kong affairs.", "description": "Oct. 16 (UPI) \u2014 Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said in her first policy address on Wednesday her government will make housing available to all", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
