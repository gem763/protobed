The silver lining is that Monday\u2019s issue will be very long!\n\nYesterday here we talked about whether politicians should be able to lie in their Facebook ads. I argued that they should be: Facebook ads are public and searchable, and if a politician or political party is out there telling lies, that seems like an important and useful thing for a democracy to know about. Facebook is big and its CEO is unaccountable to any electorate, and so I would rather the company not referee political speech.\n\nMany readers see things differently, though, so I wanted to air out a few of your takes.\n\nThe most common response I got was a kind of cake-and-eat-it-too argument in which citizens should push for (1) Facebook to be broken up but (2) referee political speech until that happens. Here\u2019s one reader take:\n\nIn reference to Facebook, you said \u201cTo worry about Facebook\u2019s vast size and influence \u2014 and I do! \u2014 while also demanding that it referee political speech seems like an odd contradiction.\u201d I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a contradiction at all. I think regardless of the size of a company, it should strive to eliminate or at least label misinformation including and perhaps especially in political ads. Those two issues are able to live side by side easily, in my opinion.\n\nI think that\u2019s basically right, though it doesn\u2019t really address my larger concern, which is the giant unaccountable corporation refereeing what politicians can say.\n\nAnother common response was that the whole thing just seems a little too convenient \u2014 Facebook gets to wash its hands of fact-checking on some of the toughest questions it will face, and reap all the profits? Here\u2019s another reader:\n\nWith the company publishing advertising content and then having it examined by third-party fact-checkers, the process might be more democratic and fair than if it were done by either Facebook or the state, but it also means that there is always a possibility that false advertising has severe implications as it is broadcast across its platform, even if it is debunked later on. In this sense, it means Facebook is practically reaping the benefits of such lax policies with regards to advertising (attracting a wide range of clients and the money from publishing advertisement) and also avoiding the responsibilities and costs associated with actually taking decisions proactively.\n\nAnother reader put it more concisely:\n\nIf it\u2019s too difficult to make sure political ads are not full of lies, they shouldn\u2019t accept political ads. Kind of like a supermarket not selling food that they aren\u2019t sure won\u2019t give you food poisoning.\n\nThese criticisms strike me as basically fair, and it\u2019s worth recalling that Facebook once considered banning political advertising as not worth the trouble. (It generates less than 5 percent of the company\u2019s revenue, according to Reuters.)\n\nBut none of this really engages with my larger frustration here, which is that people seem to be holding Facebook responsible for politicians\u2019 lies when we could be holding the politicians responsible instead. I get the fear that we live in a post-truth world where people just believe whatever their party\u2019s Facebook ad tells them to believe, but it also seems defeatist and more than a little patronizing.\n\nAs it so happens, Mark Zuckerberg discussed how the company moderates political speech in the leaked audio obtained by The Verge. In this section, which has not previously been published, an employee has asked whether Facebook ought to model its content policies strictly after the First Amendment. (A senator recently proposed making this the law of the land.) Zuckerberg says no, that most people want the company to go much further than the First Amendment. In the rest of his answer, Zuckerberg describes the difficulty of making decisions about what is misinformation when it comes to a subject like immigration in Europe, and suggests he is resigned to facing criticism here no matter what he does.\n\nHe\u2019s talking about moderation generally, not Facebook\u2019s decision to avoid making these calls on political ads. But his thinking here adds some color to why he would make that decision:\n\nMark Zuckerberg: Overall, I don\u2019t really think that people don\u2019t want us to moderate content. There\u2019s like 20 categories of harmful content that we focus on. They\u2019re all different. Everything ranging from terrorist propaganda to bullying to incitement of violence to gory content to pornography. ... 18 out of the 20 categories are not that controversial. There\u2019s some controversy and each one on the edges of exactly how you set the policies. But broadly speaking, [they] are not the thing that people are focused on.\n\nThere are two categories that are very sensitive politically, and they are hate speech and misinformation.\n\nAnd the issue on this that we\u2019ve run into on hate speech ... a lot of people think that we need to be more aggressive in moderating content that is offensive or basically would make certain groups of people feel unsafe. And then there are other groups on the other side of these debates who feel like they\u2019re engaging in legitimate political discourse.\n\nIt\u2019s always hard to talk about this in the context of your own political environment. So I find it a little easier to depressurize this, and think about some of the European debates that are going on around migration, and some of the challenges of integrating large numbers of people who have come into these different countries fleeing Syria and other places. The debate that goes on is that well, some of the stuff ends up being overly generalized and feeling hateful, some of the people on the other side [say] \u201cwell, I\u2019m trying to discuss the real issues around ... trying to integrate lots of people into a society at once.\u201d Like, we need to be able to have these debates. Where\u2019s the line?\n\nThat\u2019s really hard, and we\u2019re kind of right in the middle of that. I don\u2019t think anyone says that we shouldn\u2019t, that we should [follow the] First Amendment. But that\u2019s a really tricky balance.\n\nThe other one on misinformation, I think is really tricky. Because on the one hand, I think everyone would basically agree that you don\u2019t want the content that\u2019s getting the most distribution to be flagrant hoaxes that are tricking people. But the other side of the debate on this is that a lot of people express their life and their experiences by telling stories, and sometimes the stories are true and sometimes they\u2019re not. And people use satire and they use fiction ... and the question is, how do you differentiate and draw the line between satire or a fictional story? Where is the line?\n\nIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s 100 percent difficult, but there are new nuances in doing this. A lot of people feel like in a world where a lot of the people who are arbitrating what is misinformation and doing fact-checking tend to be left of center, that that is getting in the way of an ability to express something that they feel is real and that matches their lived experience. So you want to do both, right? You want to make sure that you give people a voice to express their lived experience in a civil way, and you want to make sure that the stuff that\u2019s going viral is not ... blatant, flagrant hoaxes that are going to be harmful.\n\nSo those two are by far the most fraught. But overall ... I haven\u2019t had anyone come to us and say, \u201cplease allow terrorist propaganda on your service.\u201d Even the people who are putting forth the bills in Congress for a debate saying that they want more openness on the platform. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna go in that direction. I just think the reality is we\u2019re kind of stuck in this nuanced area, and will continue to get it coming from a lot of different sides as we try to navigate this as well as possible.\n\nThe Ratio\n\nToday in news that could affect public perception of the tech platforms.\n\nTrending up: Google will now require manufacturers of Android devices to incorporate its digital wellbeing features, including parental controls and screen time monitoring.\n\nTrending down: Like Facebook before it, Twitter was caught using phone numbers given for two-factor authentication purposes to target ads at people.\n\nTrending down: Google contractors in London are threatening a strike over unpaid bonuses, job cuts, and bad working conditions.\n\nGoverning\n\n\u2b50 The protests in Hong Kong continue to have ripple effects around the world, as companies with business interests in China struggle to walk the line between allowing employees and customers freedom of expression without mortally offending the Chinese government.\n\nToday, Marco Rubio called on lawmakers to open an investigation into ByteDance\u2019s TikTok, citing evidence that the Chinese company is censoring content in America. Tony Romm and Drew Harwell at The Washington Post have the story:\n\nIn a series of tweets, Rubio added that he has asked the Trump administration to \u201cfully enforce anti-boycott laws\u201d that prohibit any person or \u201cU.S. subsidiaries of Chinese companies\u201d from \u201ccomplying with foreign boycotts seeking to coerce U.S. companies to conform with #China\u2019s government views.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s tweets echo waves of criticism aimed at US and Chinese tech companies for suppressing content that is supportive of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. TikTok has gotten a fair amount of this scrutiny due to its popularity and murky content moderation policies:\n\nTikTok\u2019s lack of content related to the Hong Kong protests, which Chinese leaders have pushed to undermine, has raised fears that the platform is censoring ideas the government wants to suppress. In response, TikTok\u2019s Beijing-based parent company told The Washington Post last month that the app\u2019s U.S. platform was not influenced by the Chinese government, and that the lack of protest footage could be related to users\u2019 view of the app as a place for entertainment, not politics. It declined to share any additional details about its content-moderation practices.\n\nOn the flip side, Apple is taking heat from Chinese state media for allowing an app that tracks Hong Kong police onto the App Store. After initially blocking the app, HKmap.live, Apple allowed it onto the App Store last week. It uses crowdsourcing to alert protesters to the location of law enforcement. Apple, which depends on China for revenue and manufacturing more than perhaps any other tech giant, is doing the right thing here \u2014 and it might cost them. (Verna Yu / The Guardian)\n\nThen again, Apple banned the Quartz news app from its Chinese app store. Quartz has been closely covering the Hong Kong protests.\n\nActivision Blizzard suspended a player of its game Hearthstone who expressed support for Hong Kong protestors. The move came after Ng Wai Chung, known as Blitzchung, dressed in a gas mask and goggles and used a pro-democracy protest slogan during a post-match interview. He\u2019s now banned from competing for a year. Some employees walked out of their offices Wednesday. Elsewhere, Fortnite maker Epic Games used the moment to reassure players it wouldn\u2019t ban them for political speech. (Gregor Stuart Hunter and Zheping Huang / Bloomberg)\n\nMark Zuckerberg is going to testify before the House Financial Services Committee about Libra on October 23rd. This is the first time a Facebook executive has testified before congress since David Marcus spoke to lawmakers about the company\u2019s planned cryptocurrency in July. (Akela Lacy / The Intercept)\n\nThe news comes just as lawmakers are putting pressure on Visa, Mastercard and Stripe to reconsider their involvement in the Association. In a letter to the company CEOs, Sens. Brian Schatz (D-HI) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) warned about the project\u2019s many risks, including facilitating criminal and terrorist financing and destabilizing the global financial system. (Russell Brandom / The Verge)\n\nTo top it all off, the Libra Association\u2019s head of product, Simon Morris, quietly left the group in August for undisclosed reasons. I assume the reason wasn\u2019t \u201cit\u2019s going really well and I simply have nothing left to do around here.\u201d (Alex Heath / The Information)\n\nJoe Biden asked Facebook to reject ads from the Trump campaign containing misleading information about his family\u2019s corrupt business dealings with Ukraine. Facebook said no. (Lauren Feiner / CNBC)\n\nA Senate intelligence committee released a report on Russia\u2019s 2016 election meddling, calling out tech companies like Google and YouTube for helping spread misinformation. Previous reports focused mostly on Twitter and Facebook. (Georgia Wells, Robert McMillan and Dustin Volz / The Wall Street Journal)\n\nThe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ruled that an FBI program targeting foreign suspects violated the rights of American citizens by collecting their personal data long with the data of foreign targets. The program ran from 2017 to 2018 and involved gathering email addresses and phone numbers. (Zachary Evans / National Review)\n\nIndustry\n\n\u2b50 An anti-Semitic shooting in Germany was live-streamed on Twitch. The incident could renew pressure on tech companies to catch these crimes as they happen and do more to remove replays from their servers. Makena Kelly:\n\nToday\u2019s attack echoed the March mass shooting of Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand \u2014 which was streamed on Facebook Live. In today\u2019s roughly 35-minute video, a man is seen shooting two people and attempting unsuccessfully to break into the synagogue. He also gives a brief speech into the camera, railing against Jews and denying that the Holocaust happened. Two people have been confirmed dead in today\u2019s attack, and German law enforcement has raised the possibility that multiple attackers were involved. Only one perpetrator appears in this video. It\u2019s unclear how many people watched the initial stream or how many copies may have been archived at Twitch \u2014 which is owned by Amazon \u2014 or on other sites. Extremism researcher Megan Squire reported that the video was also spread through the encrypted platform Telegram, with clips being viewed by around 15,600 accounts. The Christchurch shooting was viewed live by only a few people, but reuploaded roughly 1.5 million times after the attack \u2014 so dealing with the aftermath will be a real concern.\n\nAmericans have a patchy understanding of digital security, according to a new survey by Pew. Just 28 percent can identify an example of two-factor authentication \u2014 one of the most important ways to protect online accounts. And nearly half weren\u2019t sure what private browsing is. (Emily A. Vogels and Monica Anderson / Pew)\n\nInstagram turned Throwback Thursday into an official feature. It\u2019s called \u201cOn This Day,\u201d and allows users to share a random photo they posted on the same calendar date in the past. The launch is part of the app\u2019s new \u201cCreate\u201d mode, which lets users play around with interactive stickers, drawings and text without needing to take a photo first. (Josh Constine / TechCrunch)\n\nYouTube launched a new tool that lets politicians book ad space months in advance. The tool could be valuable for politicians looking to capitalize on YouTube\u2019s targeted ad capabilities before voting begins in Iowa and New Hampshire in February. (Emily Glazer and Patience Haggin / The Wall Street Journal)\n\nYouTube narrowly passed Netflix as the #1 video streaming platform for teens, according to a study from investment firm Piper Jaffray. Netflix still beat out Hulu and Amazon by a comfortable margin. (Annie Palmer / CNBC)\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Airband initiative, which launched in 2017 to improve rural internet access across the US, is now expanding to Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa. The goal is to get 40 million more people connected to the internet by July 2022. (Jon Porter / The Verge)\n\nAnd finally...\n\nColeen Rooney Accused Someone Using Rebekah Vardy\u2019s Instagram Account Of Selling Fake Stories About Her To The Tabloids And It\u2019s So Dramatic\n\nGenerally speaking I try to stay out of disputes between the wives and girlfriends (WAGs!) of British footballers. Even when one of them is maybe secretly funneling stories about another one to the tabloids. But then Coleen Rooney revealed her devilishly clever method of uncovering her betrayer. She spent five months posting fake stories to her Instagram account, limiting the audience for those stories to a single person \u2014 fellow WAG Rebekah Vardy.\n\nNormally this is where I would quote the story, but my favorite element of this drama isn\u2019t captured in this piece: Coleen has now been feted on Twitter with her very own hashtag: #WagathaChristie.\n\nTalk to us\n\nSend us tips, comments, questions, and even more misleading political ads: casey@theverge.com and zoe@theverge.com.", "description": "In leaked audio, Mark Zuckerberg says a different approach to content moderation is needed.
