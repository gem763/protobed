Anomaly 2. Antwohnette 3. Charmayanne 4. Panda 5. Sianna-Marrie 6. Snowdrop 7. Starlette 8. Velvette 9. Vin'nyla 10. Windy\n\nThe first name to get a mention on Sabrina's list is 'Anomaly'.\n\nThis is an unusual name choice when you consider the dictionary definition of the word reveals the meaning is 'one that is abnormal or does not fit in'.\n\nThis is followed by 'Antwohnette', which is quite possibly a bogan misspelling of the popular French girls' name Antoinette.\n\nThird place is claimed by 'Charmayanne', a name that gets an exotic touch, thanks to the inclusion of an extra 'a'.\n\nThe less offensive 'Panda' holds the fourth spot, while the non-nonsensical 'Sianna-Marrie' takes out fifth.\n\n'Snowdrop' is the sixth most popular girls' 'bogan' baby name of the year.\n\nThis is a name that Sabrina said comes from a type of flower.\n\n'I'll give them half a point for choosing a name that actually means something instead of making one up,' she wrote.\n\n'Starlette' comes in seventh alongside 'Velvette', which comes in eighth.\n\nAccording to the parenting author, adding 'ette' to the end of name doesn't make it 'any more glamorous'.\n\nThose choosing to steer clear of gender specific names can opt for ninth place holder 'Vin'nyla'.\n\n'Vin is a diminutive of the male name Vincent meaning \"conquering\", while Nyla is a female Arabic moniker that means \"winner\",' Sabrina said.\n\nWhile many parents consider a conventional name when they are naming their child (stock image), Sabrina reveals that more unusual monikers are increasingly popular\n\nTenth place goes to 'Windy' - a rather unfortunate moniker for a boy or girl.\n\nWhat are the top 10 bogan names for boys? 1. Brayan 2. Kanaan 3. Kairo 4. Pluto 5. Precise 6. Sincere 7. Tenysi 8. Tigger 9. Tokyo 10. Wiatt\n\nThe bizarre mash-up of 'Brayan' - a combination of Bryan and Ryan sees this moniker awarded eleventh place while 'Kanaan', a variation of Cannon, takes out twelfth.\n\n'Kairo', an more exotic spelling of Cairo, was awarded the thirteenth spot with 'Pluto' and 'Precise' taking out fourteenth and fifteenth place respectively.\n\nOther names to feature included 'Sincere' (sixteenth) and 'Tenysi' (seventeenth).\n\n'Tigger', the name of a character from Winnie the Pooh, was awarded eighteenth place while 'Tokyo', sits at nineteenth.\n\nThe last name on the list nods to current naming trends Wyatt.\n\nHowever, in true bogan form it's misspelt as 'Wiatt'.\n\nSabrina said she was already struggling when she heard celebrities like Goldie Hawn and Sheryl Crow had claimed the name for their children.\n\n'But misspelling it with an \"I\" is just too much for me,' she said.", "description": "A list of 'bogan' baby names of 2019 has been revealed.
