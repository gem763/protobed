(Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nWashington-area elected officials voted Wednesday to push their local governments to address the region\u2019s affordable-housing shortage by setting individual targets to increase production of low- and medium-cost housing by 2030.\n\nThe Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG) said the region needs to add 320,000 housing units between 2020 and 2030 \u2014 75,000 more units than forecast.\n\nOf those, at least three-quarters should be affordable to low- and middle-income households, according to a resolution approved unanimously by the COG board, which means they should cost $2,500 a month or less.\n\nIn addition, at least three-quarters should be in employment centers or near transit, to reduce commuting times and curb the region\u2019s chronic traffic congestion, COG said.\n\nThe COG proposal, in the works for more than a year, sets what many officials and experts view as a necessary and worthy goal for the region. The alternative, they warned, is a housing crisis similar to those seen on the West Coast.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t afford to live in San Francisco \u2014 the workforce [there] is being displaced,\u201d said COG Vice Chair Derrick Leon Davis (D), who headed the panel\u2019s Housing Strategy Group and is a Prince George\u2019s County Council member representing District 6.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be that region,\u201d Davis said.\n\n[D.C. region\u2019s leaders face big challenges as they tackle affordable-housing shortage]\n\nBut COG, the region\u2019s planning body, has no power to enforce its recommendations, and it set no deadline for jurisdictions to commit to housing targets.\n\nEven though the board\u2019s membership is composed of elected leaders from the 24 county and municipal governments in the region \u2014 comprising the District, Northern Virginia and Maryland suburbs \u2014 the individual jurisdictions are free to ignore the call if they choose.\n\nThat is significant because it will be costly and politically difficult for individual jurisdictions to make the far-reaching changes necessary to overcome the affordable-housing shortage.\n\nReaching the target would require increasing public subsidies, such as for rental vouchers and low-cost loans. That would mean raising taxes or redirecting funds from other priorities such as schools and transportation.\n\nIt also would require relaxing zoning and regulatory restrictions to allow for increased density, such as more multifamily apartment buildings in neighborhoods dominated by single-family homes. Such proposals frequently face opposition from residents worried about more traffic, crowded schools and changes in the character of their communities.\n\n[Bowser, D.C. Council offer competing visions on affordable-housing crisis]\n\n\u201cThis is the tackle of the generation to come,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe do know that housing affordability in this region is going to be a very, very difficult task.\u201d\n\nA COG staff report acknowledged that the jurisdictions \u201cface a variety of challenges \u2014 from community dynamics and market forces, to competing funding priorities and reduced federal resources.\u201d\n\nIt called for \u201ca range of tools and innovative policies to meet these targets, including strategic partnerships with the business, nonprofit and philanthropic sectors.\u201d\n\nThe COG action comes a week after the release of an Urban Institute report that made many of the same recommendations. The COG staff report cited that study in saying that more than a half-million of the region\u2019s households are \u201chousing cost-burdened,\u201d which means they spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing.\n\n[D.C. region\u2019s leaders face big challenges as they tackle affordable-housing shortage]\n\nResidents in middle- and low-wage occupations who are most affected include service workers, nursing attendants, paramedics, security guards, firefighters and graphic designers.\n\n\u201cThe region\u2019s current unmet housing needs undercut its appeal to new companies and talent, strain the transportation system and impact the environment and quality of life for residents,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe solution is for housing to be preserved and created at a higher rate than has been achieved in the recent past.\u201d\n\nCOG also estimated that more than 325,000 people commute daily into metropolitan Washington from outside the region because they cannot afford to live closer to their jobs.\n\n\u201cFor some, this means not only long commutes to work, but also difficult choices between paying rent or affording other basic necessities such as food or medicine,\u201d the report said.\n\nIn urging individual jurisdictions to commit to increase the production of affordable housing, COG did not specify what targets each county or municipality should set. But it suggested that they could divide up the responsibility according to how much their population was expected to grow.\n\n[Area residents, not Amazon newcomers, are fueling Northern Virginia real estate frenzy, agents say]\n\nThe only jurisdiction that has set a numerical target for increased affordable-housing production is the District. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) has pledged to add 36,000 units by 2025, of which one-third will be affordable housing.\n\nLeaders of Fairfax and Montgomery counties, the region\u2019s two most populous jurisdictions, expressed optimism after the vote that their governments would address housing \u2014 but they declined to predict when they would set specific targets.\n\nMontgomery County Council President Nancy Navarro (D-District 4) said her goal was for the council to approve a resolution on housing by November. Fairfax Board of Supervisors Chair Sharon Bulova (D-At Large) said a new board to be elected in November appears likely to favor doing more for affordable housing.\n\nThe COG report noted that Montgomery and Arlington counties, along with the District, are allowing residents to build accessory dwelling units to increase density. Fairfax, Prince George\u2019s and Arlington have developed comprehensive housing strategies.\n\nCOG leaders also said they were encouraged that regional business and nonprofit leaders were showing more interest in taking action to build more affordable housing.\n\nBut officials acknowledged that public resistance can be strong.\n\n\u201cThis climate of fear is out there,\u201d Rockville Mayor Bridget Donnell Newton said. \u201cWhen people hear \u2018more housing,\u2019 they are immediately panicked about the roads and schools.\u201d\n\nCOG Chairman Robert C. White Jr. (D), an at-large member of the D.C. Council, said the setting of targets was only a first step.\n\n\u201cWhat none of us wants is to spend all this time and effort with the region, with governments, with nonprofits, with the private sector, just to do a report that doesn\u2019t get acted upon,\u201d White said. \u201cThe most important part of this is the action that follows. So we will be pushing each other.\u201d", "description": "Council of Governments wants three-quarters of new units to be for low- or middle-income households.", "authors": ["Robert Mccartney", "Senior Regional Correspondent Covering Government", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/50ESeWS09BO28JHWyzTbBswEEFo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7IHBU5SBAMI6TBNNO6PPAX6Z3A.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
