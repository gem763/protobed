And a planned delayed broadcast on Thursday by South Korean TV was cancelled, after video footage provided by the North turned out to be too poor quality.\n\nOn the field, the North Korean players were accused of playing in an excessively aggressive manner, jumping into their opponents with knees up and throwing out their elbows and hands while shielding the ball.\n\nSome of the only video footage circulating of the game actually comes from Sweden\u2019s ambassador to North Korea, Joachim Bergstr\u00f6m, who was among a handful of foreign officials permitted to attend the game alongside Fifa president Gianni Infantino. Sweden is one of few countries to enjoy good diplomatic relations with the North.\n\nMr Bergstr\u00f6m posted short clips of the match to Twitter, one of which showed South Korea captain and Tottenham Hotspur forward Son Heung-min breaking up a large scuffle between players from both sides.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad we didn\u2019t win. To be honest, the game was so tough that I think we were very lucky already to be back with no one injured,\u201d Son told reporters on arrival at Seoul\u2019s Incheon airport.\n\nSon accused the North Korean players of being \u201csensitive and aggressive\u201d and swearing a lot during the match. \u201cWe could hear many very offensive curses from the other side,\u201d he said.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It was really difficult. I have never seen something like this in football before.\u201d\n\nMr Bergstr\u00f6m dismissed the bad-tempered nature of the match as \u201cemotions running high\u201d. Other clips he shared showed both national anthems being played, with North Korean soldiers dotted throughout the empty stadium standing to attention and saluting on the North\u2019s turn.\n\nAnother clip showed an attack by South Korea, on paper by far the better team, ending in an offside decision.\n\nFifa\u2019s official report from the game hardly reflected its aggressive nature, stating that each side received just two yellow cards. Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency published only a brief match report, saying the \"game of attacks and counterattacks ended in a draw 0-0\u201d.\n\nBut Mr Infantino later issued a statement saying he was \u201cdisappointed to see there were no fans in the stands\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised by this and by several issues related to its live broadcast and problems with visas and access for foreign journalists,\u201d Mr Infantino said. International sports reporters were also barred from attending.\n\nSome analysts have suggested North Korea decided to bar home fans because it did not want to allow South Korea\u2019s supporters to travel to the game, while at the same time preferring to avoid accusations of creating an unfair environment for the match.\n\nOthers, as well as Son himself, said it could be because officials wanted to avoid the potential for thousands of North Koreans to witness their country in a humiliating defeat - Kim Jong-un, the North\u2019s dictator, is known to be a big sports fan.\n\nSon said he wasn\u2019t surprised to see the stadium empty. \u201cIt rather made me think that (the North Koreans) thought us as a strong team,\u201d he said.\n\nEither way, the circumstances of the match reflect poor relations between the two countries, particularly since the South attempted to disconnect its own attempts to improve inter-Korean trade and cooperation from nuclear talks involving its ally the US.\n\nNorth Korea is adamant that Washington be involve in talks so that it can leverage its increasingly sophisticated nuclear arsenal in exchange for more sweeping international sanctions relief.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s unification minister Kim Yeon-chul, the government\u2019s leading official on matters relating to the North, told parliament on Thursday that the way Pyongyang handled the game was \u201cvery disappointing\u201d and reflected the current stalemate in talks.\n\nThe two sides will have to wait until 4 June to face each other again for the return fixture in Seoul, a match that could prove crucial with the teams tied on 7 points at the top of Group H. The other teams in the 2022 qualifying group are Lebanon, Turkmenistan and Sri Lanka.", "description": "South Korean officials have described a football match against North Korea in Pyongyang as \u201clike a war\u201d, with players saying they were just happy to return to Seoul without suffering any injuries.
