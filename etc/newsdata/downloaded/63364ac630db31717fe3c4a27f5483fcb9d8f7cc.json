Many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is eroding that autonomy.\n\nChina denies the accusation of meddling and says Hong Kong is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests, accusing the United States and Britain of fomenting unrest, and warned of the damage to the economy.\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced concessions this week aimed at ending the protests, including formally scrapping a hugely unpopular extradition bill, but many said the concessions were too little, too late.\n\nShe said Beijing backed her \"all the way\".\n\nThe bill, which ignited the protests in June, would have allowed the extradition of people to mainland China to stand trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party. Hong Kong has an independent judiciary dating back to British rule.\n\nBut the demonstrations have long since broadened into calls for more democracy and many protesters have pledged to fight on.\n\nThe U.S. State Department updated its travel advisory for Hong Kong, warning that U.S. citizens and consular employees had been the targets of a recent propaganda campaign by China \"falsely accusing the United States of fomenting unrest\".\n\nThe overall risk level remains at the second lowest of a four-level gauge, after it was raised on Aug. 7 to reflect the escalating violence.\n\n( Writing by Nick Macfie; Editing by Michael Perry)", "description": "Hong Kong protesters calling for democracy for the Chinese-ruled city plan to take their message to the U.S. Consulate on Sunday after another night of violence in the 14th week of unrest.
