The bits of 'ham' do appear to be a lot thinner but delicious regardless.'\n\nMatt Clayton also commented on how the plant-based Hawaiian tasted exactly the same as a normal Domino's pizza.\n\n'The 'meat' was maybe a bit less substantial,' he said.\n\nThe plant-based Supreme had the same positive reaction as the prior pizzas, with slices of plant-based ham, pepperoni and beef in the toppings.\n\nFemail reporter Emilia Mazza said: 'As a person who describes themselves as \"vegan-ish\", I think the pizza definitely passes the test.'\n\nThe plant-based Supreme (pictured) had the same positive reaction as the prior pizzas, with slices of plant-based ham, pepperoni and beef in the toppings\n\n'There's plenty of flavour in the faux pepperoni and the texture is good as well. Only complaint was I couldn't really taste any cheese but this wasn't too much of a problem.\n\n'Overall, I'd definitely rate it and would be happy to eat this as an occasional takeout treat.'\n\nDomino's Australia and New Zealand CEO Nick Knight said the new pizzas reflected the company's commitment to making pizzas for everyone.\n\n'Introducing iconic toppings such as ham and pepperoni to our plant-based range means our customers have more choice than ever before,' he said.\n\nDomino's the first pizza chain in Australia to offer plant-based pepperoni and the first in the world to offer plant-based ham (stock image)\n\n'Now vegans, vegetarians and flexitarians alike can enjoy some of our most popular menu items.'\n\nMr Knight said even those with specific health, religious, allergen and dietary requirements are enjoying the new range.\n\n'We are proud of our new plant-based toppings, which are made in Australia specially for Domino's, and are just as tasty and affordable as the real deal,' he said.\n\n'We will continue to listen to feedback and give our customers more of what they love!'\n\nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) acknowledged the plant-based range, awarding Domino's the Vegan Taco Fiesta 'Best Vegan Pizza' in Australia at its inaugural 2019 Australia Vegan Food Awards.\n\nThe entire plant-based pizza range is now available from all Domino's stores across Australia.\n\n", "description": "Following the expansion of plant-based beef in Australia, the fast-food giant is now offering up meat-free Pepperoni, Hawaiian, Ham and Cheese, and Supreme.", "authors": ["Lauren Ferri For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/05/20019172-0-image-a-16_1571717883013.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
