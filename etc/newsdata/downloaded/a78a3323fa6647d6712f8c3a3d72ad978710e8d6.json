The U.S.-China trade war has weighed heavily on the export-reliant city state, with manufacturing taking the brunt of the pain.\n\n\u201cWe thought the final sentence in the statement -- that MAS \u2018is prepared to recalibrate monetary policy should prospects for inflation and growth weaken significantly\u2019 -- is telling of its intentions,\u201d said Terence Wu, a currency strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore. \u201cFor now, we do not rule out a further reduction of slope to zero appreciation in the next meeting.\u201d\n\nThe Singapore dollar gained as much as 0.4% to S$1.3679 against the U.S. dollar Monday. The Straits Times Index climbed 0.5% as of 10:15 a.m. in Singapore.\u200b\n\n\u200bCentral bankers globally are taking a more dovish stance as trade tensions weigh on growth and as manufacturing weakness threatens to spill over into services sectors. In Singapore, authorities have taken a gradual approach as they monitor risks and keep a close watch on labor-market indicators that so far have stayed resilient.\n\nAn early reading of gross domestic product data Monday showed the economy grew an annualized 0.6% in the third quarter from the previous three months, rebounding from a contraction of 2.7%. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists was for growth of 1.2%. Compared with a year ago, GDP rose 0.1%, unchanged from the second quarter.\n\n\u201cGDP numbers, despite skirting a technical recession, do not make for an upbeat read,\u201d said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Singapore. \u201cThe manufacturing recession continues. The outlook is at best hazy, if not gloomy.\u201d\n\nSingapore\u2019s growth is expected to pick up modestly next year, \u201calthough this projection is subject to considerable uncertainty in the external environment,\u201d the MAS said. These are its latest projections for inflation and growth:\n\nGDP growth will likely be around the midpoint of the 0-1% forecast range in 2019. The output gap has turned \u201cslightly negative\u201d and is expected to persist into 2020\n\nCore inflation is expected to come in at the lower end of the 1-2% range in 2019 and average 0.5%-1.5% in 2020\n\nAll-items CPI is projected to be around 0.5% this year and average 0.5-1.5% in 2020\n\nStandard Chartered\n\n\u201cWe think the MAS\u2019 core inflation forecast for 2020 suggests the door for further easing is open, if needed,\u201d said Divya Devesh, head of Southeast and South Asia currency research at(LON: ) Plc in Singapore.\n\nThe MAS guides the local dollar against a basket of its counterparts and adjusts the pace of its appreciation or depreciation by changing the slope, width and center of a currency band. It doesn\u2019t disclose details of the basket, or the band or the pace of appreciation or depreciation.\n\nThe monetary policy decision was predicted by 14 of the 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, with the remainder projecting a more aggressive move to a zero-appreciation posture for the currency band. The MAS held policy in April after tightening twice last year.", "description": "Singapore Central Bank Signals More Easing as Growth Risks Mount", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic31ee50285ca59b9d6a9daa085a6fa3e2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
