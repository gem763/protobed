A win waiting to happen. Such is the case with Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Mindy Kaling\u2019s forthcoming Indian wedding comedy.\n\nWhen PureWow chatted with Chopra Jonas about her role selecting the Pilot Pen 2018 G2 Overachievers Grant, we couldn\u2019t help but ask for an update on the project and what it\u2019s been like working with Kaling.\n\nChopra Jonas, 37, explained, \u201cWe\u2019ve just started the writing process, but she\u2019s incredible and someone I\u2019ve always looked up to. As an Indian working in America, I think she\u2019s so supremely talented and hysterically funny and is just a great girl.\u201d\n\nThe Quantico star went on explain that the comedy feels important on a deeper level. \u201cCollaborating with [Kaling] is something I\u2019m so excited about because this will be an all Indian, all Asian star cast and I feel like that\u2019s also something I\u2019m really proud of, creating opportunities for South Asian actors that work in a mainstream capacity. As a producer and as someone in the movie, it\u2019s really something I\u2019m looking forward to. But it\u2019s going to be next year because we just started writing,\u201d she said.\n\nChopra Jonas\u2019s excitement and thoughts about her producing partner echo those of Kaling. When PureWow spoke with the 40-year-old Late Night star this past June, she had lovely things to say about Chopra and their collaboration. \u201cOur relationship has kind of just begun professionally, but she\u2019s incredibly smart and fun and glamorous\u2014very glamorous,\u201d Kaling shared. \u201cWe just love a lot of the same things. I really admire her.\u201d\n\nKaling went on to note how Chopra Jonas\u2019s work ethic continues to amaze her: \u201cI think I work hard, and she is just killing it. I feel like she\u2019s in a different city every day, flying for work and for her husband\u2019s family and now her family. It\u2019s just really inspiring to be around her,\u201d she said.\n\nIt's no wonder Pilot Pen tapped Chopra Jonas to help them choose overachievers to celebrate who are making a difference in their communities.\n\nRELATED: Greg Daniels, Creator of \u2018The Office,\u2019 Just Dashed Our Dreams of a Reboot", "description": "What do you get when you combine two powerhouse women together in one comedy?
