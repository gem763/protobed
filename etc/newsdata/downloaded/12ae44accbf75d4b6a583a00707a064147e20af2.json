This just hours after it was revealed that the disgraced Wall Street financier received a thank you letter for a donation made to a professor, which happened to be signed by the president of MIT himself.\n\nMIT President L. Rafael Reif admitted that the 2012 letter was indeed signed by him in a letter posted to the school\u2019s website.\n\nUsing a team from the law firm Goodwin Procter, the investigators \"found a copy of a standard acknowledgment letter thanking Jeffrey Epstein for a gift to [professor] Seth Lloyd \u2014 as far as we know now, the first gift received at MIT after Epstein\u2019s conviction,\u201d Reif wrote. \u201cI apparently signed this letter on August 16, 2012, about six weeks into my presidency. Although I do not recall it, it does bear my signature.\u201d\n\nEpstein\u2019s ties to the university\u2019s Media Lab have been received a large amount of attention stunning the elite Massachusetts school. The revelation of Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking of minor charges prompted the university to hire the Goodwin Procter law firm in an effort to review Epstein\u2019s donations and connections to the school.\n\n\"Goodwin Procter has found that in 2013, when members of my senior team learned that the Media Lab had received the first of the Epstein gifts, they reached out to speak with (MIT Media Lab director) Joi Ito,\" Reif wrote.\n\n\"He asked for permission to retain this initial gift, and members of my senior team allowed it. They knew in general terms about Epstein's history -- that he had been convicted and had served a sentence and that Joi believed that he had stopped his criminal behavior.\"\n\nIto resigned on Saturday amidst reports that he and other Media Lab employees intentionally obscured the extent of Epstein\u2019s ties to the university.\n\nGoodwin Procter\u2019s research uncovered donations made by Epstein from 2013 to 2017 from various foundations in Epstein\u2019s name.\n\nAccording to Reif, Epstein\u2019s donations were \u201cfor general research purposes, such as supporting lab scientists and buying equipment.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Harvard University president Larry Bacow finally acknowledged that the Ivy League institution had received about $9 million in donations from Epstein over the period of a decade, with the donations ending in 2007.\n\n\u201cJeffrey Epstein\u2019s crimes were repulsive and reprehensible,\u201d Bacow wrote in a letter to the Harvard community. \u201cI profoundly regret Harvard\u2019s past association with him. Conduct such as his has no place in our society.\u201d\n\nEpstein was initially convicted in 2008 as a sex offender following charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution and was sentenced to a 13-month jail term, nearly five years before the disgraced financier\u2019s involvement with MIT. He was found dead inside a federal detention center in Manhattan last month following his recent arrest.\n\n\u201cI am aware that we could and should have asked more questions about Jeffrey Epstein and about his interactions with Joi,\u201d Reif wrote. \u201cWe did not see through the limited facts we had, and we did not take time to understand the gravity of Epstein\u2019s offenses or the harm to his young victims. I take responsibility for those errors. While the fact-finding will continue, we have already identified flaws in our processes that need to be addressed.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "MIT President Rafael Reif admitted he signed a thank you letter back in 2012 to disgraced Wall Street financier Jeffrey Epstein over donations he made to the schools Media Lab.", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Rafael-Reif.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
