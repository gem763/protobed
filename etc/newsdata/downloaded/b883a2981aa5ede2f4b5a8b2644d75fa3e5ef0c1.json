I am basically out of the race.\"\n\n(Image: KIM HONG-JI/POOL/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nHamilton is now 64 points clear of Bottas with four rounds and 104 points left to play for and on the brink of moving to within one title of Michael Schumacher's record of seven.\n\nDespite Mercedes wrapping up a sixth successive constructors' championship yesterday - an unprecedented achievement - a dejected Hamilton admitted he's unlikely to wrap up the title for a third successive year in Mexico City.\n\nHe said: \"I don't anticipate it will be Mexico where I win the championship. We still have a battle.\n\n\"We could have been done better. There have been multiple scenarios this year where that has been the case. We should have got a one-two but the strategy was not optimum for me.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\"I came out from the pits and realised I lost 10 seconds, and I am like, why? If they told me I would have been that far behind Valtteri I would have said no to them, and stopped earlier.\"\n\nFor Bottas, it was a morale-boosting victory after a dreadful run of form that has seen his team-mate spearhead all-conquering Mercedes' challenge for another title crown.\n\nMercedes' success yesterday, combined with Ferrari\u2019s failure to improve on their second and seventh place with Vettel and Charles Leclerc respectively, means a Silver Arrow driver is guaranteed to win the drivers\u2019 title this season.\n\nIt breaks the record of five title doubles set by Michael Schumacher and Ferrari from 2000-4 and confirms this dominant Mercedes team as the greatest in Formula One history.\n\nBottas said: \"I'm happy, very happy. Obviously it was a close qualifying and starting third is not easy here but you don't give up and anything is possible.\"\n\nIndeed, Bottas seemingly had the win wrapped up at the first corner following Vettel\u2019s alleged false start, for which he was found not guilty, and Leclerc\u2019s similarly poor start off the line.\n\n\"I had a really nice start and Sebastian had an issue so I got the lead and the pace was super good. I enjoyed it and had fun,\" Bottas added.\n\nLeclerc\u2019s misery was compounded following an early collision with Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen and he dropped one place down to seventh after stewards handed him a post-race, 15-second penalty for a series of offences.\n\nAnother day to savour for Mercedes, another one to forget for Ferrari.", "description": "Lewis Hamilton finished third at Suzuka behind Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas and Sebastian Vettel but remains in course for sixth world title", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Xpb Images Press Association Images", "Franck Robichon Epa-Efe Rex", "Kim Hong-Ji Pool Epa-Efe Rex", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20571892.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Japanese-Grand-Prix-Race-Suzuka.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
