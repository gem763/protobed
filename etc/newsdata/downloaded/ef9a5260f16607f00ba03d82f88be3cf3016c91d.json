So I was left with only one option: to reject them; to dance raucously to \u201c...Baby One More Time,\u201d while declaring that Spears and her contemporaries were probably shallow and lacking in other ways. I was smart. I was substantial. I was no Britney Spears.\n\nI never took the time to consider whether these young pop stars felt constrained by the archetypes they had been pushed to embody; whether their own development as agents rather than objects had been stunted against their will; whether their traditional femininity was truly in opposition to \u201csubstance.\u201d Looking back two decades later, I see something more complex than teen icons to alternately revere and resent.\n\n1999 was a year filled with teen queen pop stars like Spears: Christina Aguilera, Mandy Moore, Jessica Simpson. They sang about craving sweet boys (Mandy Moore\u2019s \u201dCandy\u201d), being \u201crubbed the right way\u201d by the right man (Christina Aguilera\u2019s \u201cGenie In A Bottle\u201d), being driven crazy by a guy (Britney Spears\u2019 \u201cDrive Me Crazy\u201d) and spending \u201c10,000 lifetimes\u201d with a man (Jessica Simpson\u2019s \u201cI Wanna Love You Forever\u201d). (Beyonc\u00e9, by way of Destiny\u2019s Child, remains a notable outlier. \u201cThe Writing\u2019s On The Wall\u201d is an album that holds up.)\n\nThat year, teen queens dominated the Billboard charts. Spears\u2019 \u201c...Baby One More Time\u201d was the fifth-most-popular song of the year, according to Billboard, while Aguilera\u2019s \u201cGenie In A Bottle\u201d followed in seventh place. They graced magazine covers; not just tween and teen publications, like J-14, Teen Beat, CosmoGirl and Seventeen, but also more adult media properties, like Rolling Stone. They were hypersexualized by the male-dominated music media, for the benefit of straight, adult male readers.\n\nTake Spears\u2019 famous Rolling Stone cover: She\u2019s photographed in lingerie under the headline \u201cInside the Heart, Mind and Bedroom of a Teen Dream,\u201d and an older male writer describes her \u201choneyed thigh\u201d and \u201cample chest\u201d in the article. A few months later, in the same magazine, a different male writer referred to Aguilera as a \u201ckind of legal Lolita,\u201d with \u201cswimming-pool-blue eyes\u201d and \u201ca waist as big around as a football.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, their music was explicitly marketed to (and made popular by) tweens and teens. In \u201999, 10- to 14-year-olds accounted for nearly 10% of all CD sales, and it was their allowance money that was fueling the success of these teen pop stars. As Jon Pareles put it in July 1999 for The New York Times, \u201ckiddie-pop has always been available to those who wanted it, but in the late 1990s, it\u2019s turning into the only game in town \u2026 The entertainment business has clearly decided that youngsters now have decisive buying power.\u201d\n\nTwenty years ago, I was one of those tweens eagerly spending her limited funds at Tower Records, and I both revered and resented Spears and her pretty, famous contemporaries. I resented their flat stomachs, their carefully calibrated public images, meant to bask in the male gaze while simultaneously telegraphing that they were still \u201cgood girls.\u201d\n\nAfter all, this was the age of Spears\u2019 widely discussed sexy schoolgirl music video get-up and Simpson\u2019s virginity. The message seemed to be that successfully entering womanhood required walking an invisible tightrope, appearing sexually desirable to the general culture while withholding actual sex.\n\nAfter a yearlong national sex scandal between the president and a young former intern, it felt obvious that to be a titillating virgin was held in higher regard than being a smart (but plain) giver of blowjobs.\n\n\u201cPop culture is a huge part of how people understand the world, and in particular how young people learn what their culture values and emphasizes,\u201d said Andi Zeisler, co-founder of Bitch Media and author of \u201dWe Were Feminists Once.\u201d\n\n\u201c[In 1999], one of the things that pop culture communicated to girls was that sexuality was something you did for other people, not for yourself. Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera didn\u2019t invent that; they happened to come along at a time when pop culture had a bigger megaphone than ever before,\u201d Zeisler said.\n\nThe truth is that we are all products of our time. And in 1999, the United States was enthralled with what feminist columnist and cultural critic Susan J. Douglas called \u201cthe new girliness,\u201d a seductive \u201cpostfeminist\u201d aesthetic that telegraphed that \u201cwomen could be legally equal, but they had better be visually feminine.\u201d\n\nThis new girliness was especially pervasive in young women, giving them, as Douglas put it, \u201cthe right to choose what they wanted, and what they always wanted and truly wanted, it seemed, was to be feminine and loved by a man. This new freedom to be feminine ... set apart the young women of the 1990s from those old feminists who cared too much about boring (and irrelevant) old politics.\u201d\n\nHuffington Post Christina Aguilera (L) and Britney Spears (R) on the cover of Rolling Stone in 1999.\n\nThe teen queens seemed to embody this new girliness perfectly \u2014 at least from the viewpoint of tween and teenage music consumers, like me, who had little knowledge of the adult handlers who constructed and marketed their public personas. It is a startling experience to read through old interviews from \u201999 and see Spears go from describing all the very \u201csweet\u201d fan mail she receives to breezing through a story about a man in his mid-20s who staked out her house.\n\nThose are not the kind of stories that I remembered about Spears. My memories of her tend to skip right from sexy schoolgirl to her dancing with a snake on the VMAs stage to jarring paparazzi images of her shaved head.\n\nThere is a (not quite straight) line that can be drawn from the explicitly political, decidedly non-mainstream feminist punk Riot Grrrl movement of the early \u201990s, to the explosion of the Spice Girls in \u201996, to the popularization of pop stars like Spears. Whereas the Riot Grrrls largely rejected girlishness, by the mid-\u201990s, to be girly was to be empowered.\n\nThe Spice Girls had taken a nod from the far more radical Riot Grrrls when they turned Girl Power into an idea that could be mass-marketed and commercially viable. But pop stars like Spears and Aguilera took this one step further, decoupling female empowerment from any actual power and instead focusing primarily on individual happiness and satisfaction.\n\nIn an October 1999 interview with EW, Aguilera explicitly describes \u201cGenie in a Bottle\u201d as a song about female empowerment. But, like, chill female empowerment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a female-empowerment song, but still keeping it fun, though, and not like in your face,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about just waiting and playing hard to get, which I think is a great message for girls.\u201d\n\nI was a member of the cohort that went through elementary school loving the Spice Girls and buying mirrors for my bedroom emblazoned with \u201cgirl power.\u201d But by the time we were going through middle school, the Spice Girls had faded into the background (who even remembers Geri Halliwell\u2019s short-lived solo career?), largely overshadowed by solo female pop stars who were far closer in age to us.\n\n\u201cYou look at the Spice Girls, just two years before, and they\u2019re called the Spice Girls, but they\u2019re all grown women,\u201d Elizabeth Keenan, feminist musicologist and author of \u201dRebel Girls,\u201d told HuffPost. \u201cThe messages that they were sending out to girls, they really did have an empowerment message. Whether or not you think it was effective or whether or not you think it\u2019s \u2018real feminism,\u2019 [\u2018girl power\u2019] was saying \u2018girls can do anything!\u2019\u201d To a 7-year-old, \u2018girl power\u2019 and \u2018you can do anything\u2019 probably suffices.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to think about how Britney [Spears] and Christina [Aguilera] were positioned because they were both teenagers. They were highly sexualized teenagers,\u201d Keenan said. \u201cYou have 7-year-olds looking at the Spice Girls and being like, \u2018Oh my god. They\u2019re great.\u2019 All the sexual stuff flies over their heads. But then Britney and Christina were positioned as [artists] that tweens and teens were into. That becomes a different issue because those girls who were expected to be their fans aren\u2019t seven. Maybe they\u2019re 12. Things were not going to fly over their heads.\u201d\n\nThe story of these teen queens shows how young women try to exert agency and become the subjects of their own lives with varying degrees of success. In 2019, Moore has had a resurgence as an actress in NBC\u2019s \u201cThis Is Us\u201d and has reclaimed her narrative fully in the wake of her divorce from Ryan Adams. Yet Spears has been under financial conservatorship for more than a decade following a very public mental health breakdown. It\u2019s also a story about young women writ large, and what it means to grow up in a culture hellbent on commodifying and objectifying you.\n\nThe story of these teen queens shows how young women try to exert agency and become the subjects of their own lives with varying degrees of success. It\u2019s also a story about young women writ large, and what it means to grow up in a culture hellbent on commodifying and objectifying you.\n\nIn the two decades that have passed since 1999, the world has transformed. Social media facilitates instantaneous reactions to cultural figures as well as mainstream media coverage of them in real time. Teenagers are hyper-connected to each other, and their biggest celebrities can operate outside of the bounds of traditional cultural gatekeepers. We have an entire feminist media ecosystem ready to take down any writer who creepily describes a teenager\u2019s body and calls it journalism. We all have access to platforms that allow us to craft our own carefully curated selves, to become commodities and to view each other as aspirational \u201cinfluencers.\u201d\n\nSince \u201999, Simpson has been open about how the music industry worked to \u201cdefine\u201d and \u201cbox in\u201d its young women for public consumption. Aguilera has long since shed the image of what she labeled the \u201dcookie-cutter sweetheart\u201d and even teamed up with feminist electro-rock band Le Tigre in 2010. Moore has spoken about getting out of a marriage at a young age that stifled her music career.\n\nThere may not be any neat lessons from the year that exploded with teen queens, but reexamining our own ideas about the public figures who grew up alongside us \u2014 in our cars, and on posters in our bedrooms \u2014 still matters.\n\nAs a tween, I felt nothing but a gulf of space between myself and these slightly older successful girls. Now, as a woman in her 30s, that image is much more complicated. I understand that young women, famous or otherwise, in 2019 and in 1999 are all just trying to figure shit out, trying to telegraph a public-facing self that doesn\u2019t betray the private one. In some ways, the bounds of the conversations have mercifully changed \u2015 no one seems preoccupied with Billie Eilish\u2019s expression of her femininity. And in some ways, the challenges that the young female pop stars of the late \u201990s faced are still very much present, even amplified.\n\n\u201cLooking at the ways [teen pop stars\u2019] images and their sexuality was used to define them, and the impact it had on their lives (particularly Spears\u2019s) is important,\u201d Zeisler said, \u201cbecause that mediation \u2014 the prioritizing of image, the pervasive sexualization of girls, the way that consumers feel entitled to decide who a public figure is \u2015 has only gotten more pronounced.\u201d\n\nTo all the teen pop stars I alternately loved and resented before, I see you now in a way I never could then.\n\n\u201cFor The Love of 1999\u201d is a weeklong series offering some totally bangin\u2019 essays and analysis of some hot \u2014 or not \u2014 TV, music, movies and celebrities of 1999.
