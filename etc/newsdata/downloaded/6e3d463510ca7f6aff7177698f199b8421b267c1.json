That stat line was prolific enough to be unique in NFL history.\n\nPer Pro Football Reference's Play Index, Lamar Jackson is the first player in NFL history to throw for at least 270 yards and rush for at least 120 in the same game. \u2014 Adam Kilgore (@AdamKilgoreWP) September 15, 2019\n\nThat comes after last season, in which Jackson set an NFL record for rushing attempts by a quarterback with 147, prompting some concerns about his long-term durability and viability. Records like the one above are probably more what the Ravens wanted to see.\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free on the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nThe 22-year-old likely wasn\u2019t going to last in the league if he had to run up the middle several times per game, so something needed to change. Basically, he had to make teams respect his arm.\n\nHe delivered some more good news on that front yet again Sunday.\n\nLamar Jackson's passing is pretty for a running back. As it turns out, so is his running.

The Cardinals did a better job on defense for the rest of the game, but Jackson was still able to break off a number of significant runs to keep the Ravens ahead.\n\nThe game effectively ended on what was quite possibly Jackson\u2019s best throw all afternoon. Up by six points and on third-and-11 with three minutes remaining, Jackson dropped a perfect pass into the hands of a downfield Marquise Brown for 41 yards.\n\nThe Ravens sealed the win with a few more runs in the red zone, and left the field 2-0. Jackson missed on a few downfield throws and took a few sacks, but still very much looked like one of the most dangerous players in the NFL. And definitely not a running back.\n\nThrough two games, Jackson is 41-for-57 with 596 passing yards, seven touchdowns and zero interceptions. He seems to have two breakout receivers catching passes for him in second-year tight end Mark Andrews (220 receiving yards, 16 receptions and two touchdowns so far) and first-rounder Marquise \u201cHollywood\u201d Brown (233 yards, 12 catches and two TDs). And he can still do stuff like this.\n\nIt\u2019s still early in the season and the Ravens haven\u2019t faced the best teams so far, but Jackson has looked like the quarterback that Ravens fans have dreamed of since he was taken 32nd overall in last year\u2019s draft.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Lamar Jackson's passing is pretty for a running back.
