Lee is how few of the qualities his admirers profess to see in him he actually possessed. Memorial Day has the tendency to conjure up old arguments about the Civil War. That\u2019s understandable; it was created to mourn the dead of a war in which the Union was nearly destroyed, when half the country rose up in rebellion in defense of slavery. This year, the removal of Lee\u2019s statue in New Orleans has inspired a new round of commentary about Lee, not to mention protests on his behalf by white supremacists. The myth of Lee goes something like this: He was a brilliant strategist and devoted Christian man who abhorred slavery and labored tirelessly after the war to bring the country back together. There is little truth in this. Lee was a devout Christian, and historians regard him as an accomplished tactician. But despite his ability to win individual battles, his decision to fight a conventional war against the more densely populated and industrialized North is considered by many historians to have been a fatal strategic error.\n\nBut even if one conceded Lee\u2019s military prowess, he would still be responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans in defense of the South\u2019s authority to own millions of human beings as property because they are black. Lee\u2019s elevation is a key part of a 150-year-old propaganda campaign designed to erase slavery as the cause of the war and whitewash the Confederate cause as a noble one. That ideology is known as the Lost Cause, and as historian David Blight writes, it provided a \u201cfoundation on which Southerners built the Jim Crow system.\u201d There are unwitting victims of this campaign\u2014those who lack the knowledge to separate history from sentiment. Then there are those whose reverence for Lee relies on replacing the actual Lee with a mythical figure who never truly existed. In the Richmond Times Dispatch, R. David Cox wrote that \u201cFor white supremacist protesters to invoke his name violates Lee\u2019s most fundamental convictions.\u201d In the conservative publication Townhall, Jack Kerwick concluded that Lee was \u201camong the finest human beings that has ever walked the Earth.\u201d John Daniel Davidson, in an essay for The Federalist, opposed the removal of the Lee statute in part on the grounds that Lee \u201carguably did more than anyone to unite the country after the war and bind up its wounds.\u201d Praise for Lee of this sort has flowed forth from past historians and presidents alike. This is too divorced from Lee\u2019s actual life to even be classed as fan fiction; it is simply historical illiteracy.\n\nWhite supremacy does not \u201cviolate\u201d Lee\u2019s \u201cmost fundamental convictions.\u201d White supremacy was one of Lee\u2019s most fundamental convictions. Lee was a slaveowner\u2014his own views on slavery were explicated in an 1856 letter that it often misquoted to give the impression that Lee was some kind of an abolitionist. In the letter, he describes slavery as \u201ca moral & political evil,\u201d but goes on to explain that: I think it however a greater evil to the white man than to the black race, & while my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more strong for the former. The blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally, socially & physically. The painful discipline they are undergoing, is necessary for their instruction as a race, & I hope will prepare & lead them to better things. How long their subjugation may be necessary is known & ordered by a wise Merciful Providence. Their emancipation will sooner result from the mild & melting influence of Christianity, than the storms & tempests of fiery Controversy. The argument here is that slavery is bad for white people, good for black people, and most importantly, it is better than abolitionism; emancipation must wait for divine intervention. That black people might not want to be slaves does not enter into the equation; their opinion on the subject of their own bondage is not even an afterthought to Lee.\n\nLee\u2019s cruelty as a slavemaster was not confined to physical punishment. In Reading the Man, the historian Elizabeth Brown Pryor\u2019s portrait of Lee through his writings, Pryor writes that \u201cLee ruptured the Washington and Custis tradition of respecting slave families,\u201d by hiring them off to other plantations, and that \u201cby 1860 he had broken up every family but one on the estate, some of whom had been together since Mount Vernon days.\u201d The separation of slave families was one of the most unfathomably devastating aspects of slavery, and Pryor wrote that Lee\u2019s slaves regarded him as \u201cthe worst man I ever see.\u201d The trauma of rupturing families lasted lifetimes for the enslaved\u2014it was, as my colleague Ta-Nehisi Coates described it, \u201ca kind of murder.\u201d After the war, thousands of the emancipated searched desperately for kin lost to the market for human flesh, fruitlessly for most. In Reconstruction, the historian Eric Foner quotes a Freedmen\u2019s Bureau agent who notes of the emancipated, \u201cin their eyes, the work of emancipation was incomplete until the families which had been dispersed by slavery were reunited.\u201d Lee\u2019s heavy hand on the Arlington plantation, Pryor writes, nearly led to a slave revolt, in part because the enslaved had been expected to be freed upon their previous master\u2019s death, and Lee had engaged in a dubious legal interpretation of his will in order to keep them as his property, one that lasted until a Virginia court forced him to free them.\n\nWhen two of his slaves escaped and were recaptured, Lee either beat them himself or ordered the overseer to \"lay it on well.\" Wesley Norris, one of the slaves who was whipped, recalled that \u201cnot satisfied with simply lacerating our naked flesh, Gen. Lee then ordered the overseer to thoroughly wash our backs with brine, which was done.\u201d Every state that seceded mentioned slavery as the cause in their declarations of secession. Lee\u2019s beloved Virginia was no different, accusing the federal government of \u201cperverting\u201d its powers \u201cnot only to the injury of the people of Virginia, but to the oppression of the Southern Slaveholding States.\u201d Lee\u2019s decision to fight for the South can only be described as a choice to fight for the continued existence of human bondage in America\u2014even though for the Union, it was not at first a war for emancipation. During his invasion of Pennsylvania, Lee\u2019s Army of Northern Virginia enslaved free blacks and brought them back to the South as property. Pryor writes that \u201cevidence links virtually every infantry and cavalry unit in Lee\u2019s army\u201d with the abduction of free black Americans, \u201cwith the activity under the supervision of senior officers.\u201d Soldiers under Lee\u2019s command at the Battle of the Crater in 1864 massacred black Union soldiers who tried to surrender. Then, in a spectacle hatched by Lee\u2019s senior corps commander A.P. Hill, the Confederates paraded the Union survivors through the streets of Petersburg to the slurs and jeers of the southern crowd. Lee never discouraged such behavior. As the historian Richard Slotkin wrote in No Quarter: The Battle of the Crater, \u201chis silence was permissive.\u201d\n\nThe presence of black soldiers on the field of battle shattered every myth the South\u2019s slave empire was built on: the happy docility of slaves, their intellectual inferiority, their cowardice, their inability to compete with whites. As Pryor writes, \u201cfighting against brave and competent African Americans challenged every underlying tenet of southern society.\u201d The Confederate response to this challenge was to visit every possible atrocity and cruelty upon black soldiers whenever possible, from enslavement to execution. As the historian James McPherson recounts in Battle Cry of Freedom, in October of that same year, Lee proposed an exchange of prisoners with the Union general Ulysses S. Grant. \u201cGrant agreed, on condition that blacks be exchanged \u2018the same as white soldiers.\u2019\u201d Lee\u2019s response was that \u201cnegroes belonging to our citizens are not considered subjects of exchange and were not included in my proposition.\u201d Because slavery was the cause for which Lee fought, he could hardly be expected to easily concede, even at the cost of the freedom of his own men, that blacks could be treated as soldiers and not things. Grant refused the offer, telling Lee that \u201cGovernment is bound to secure to all persons received into her armies the rights due to soldiers.\u201d Despite its desperate need for soldiers, the Confederacy did not relent from this position until a few months before Lee\u2019s surrender.\n\nAfter the war, Lee did counsel defeated southerners against rising up against the North. Lee might have become a rebel once more, and urged the South to resume fighting\u2014as many of his former comrades wanted him to. But even in this task Grant, in 1866, regarded his former rival as falling short, saying that Lee was \u201csetting an example of forced acquiescence so grudging and pernicious in its effects as to be hardly realized.\u201d Nor did Lee\u2019s defeat lead to an embrace of racial egalitarianism. The war was not about slavery, Lee insisted later, but if it was about slavery, it was only out of Christian devotion that white southerners fought to keep blacks enslaved. Lee told a New York Herald reporter, in the midst of arguing in favor of somehow removing blacks from the South (\u201cdisposed of,\u201d in his words), \u201cthat unless some humane course is adopted, based on wisdom and Christian principles you do a gross wrong and injustice to the whole negro race in setting them free. And it is only this consideration that has led the wisdom, intelligence and Christianity of the South to support and defend the institution up to this time.\u201d Lee had beaten or ordered his own slaves to be beaten for the crime of wanting to be free, he fought for the preservation of slavery, his army kidnapped free blacks at gunpoint and made them unfree\u2014but all of this, he insisted, had occurred only because of the great Christian love the South held for blacks. Here we truly understand Frederick Douglass\u2019s admonition that \"between the Christianity of this land and the Christianity of Christ, I recognize the widest possible difference.\"\n\nPrivately, according to the correspondence collected by his own family, Lee counseled others to hire white labor instead of the freedmen, observing \u201cthat wherever you find the negro, everything is going down around him, and wherever you find a white man, you see everything around him improving.\u201d In another letter, Lee wrote \u201cYou will never prosper with blacks, and it is abhorrent to a reflecting mind to be supporting and cherishing those who are plotting and working for your injury, and all of whose sympathies and associations are antagonistic to yours. I wish them no evil in the world\u2014on the contrary, will do them every good in my power, and know that they are misled by those to whom they have given their confidence; but our material, social, and political interests are naturally with the whites.\u201d Publicly, Lee argued against the enfranchisement of blacks, and raged against Republican efforts to enforce racial equality on the South. Lee told Congress that blacks lacked the intellectual capacity of whites and \u201ccould not vote intelligently,\u201d and that granting them suffrage would \u201cexcite unfriendly feelings between the two races.\u201d Lee explained that \u201cthe negroes have neither the intelligence nor the other qualifications which are necessary to make them safe depositories of political power.\u201d To the extent that Lee believed in reconciliation, it was between white people, and only on the precondition that black people would be denied political power and therefore the ability to shape their own fate.\n\nLee is not remembered as an educator, but his life as president of Washington College (later Washington and Lee) is tainted as well. According to Pryor, students at Washington formed their own chapter of the KKK, and were known by the local Freedmen\u2019s Bureau to attempt to abduct and rape black schoolgirls from the nearby black schools. There were at least two attempted lynchings by Washington students during Lee\u2019s tenure, and Pryor writes that \u201cthe number of accusations against Washington College boys indicates that he either punished the racial harassment more laxly than other misdemeanors, or turned a blind eye to it,\u201d adding that he \u201cdid not exercise the near imperial control he had at the school, as he did for more trivial matters, such as when the boys threatened to take unofficial Christmas holidays.\u201d In short, Lee was as indifferent to crimes of violence toward blacks carried out by his students as he was when they were carried out by his soldiers. Lee died in 1870, as Democrats and ex-Confederates were commencing a wave of terrorist violence that would ultimately reimpose their domination over the Southern states. The Ku Klux Klan was founded in 1866; there is no evidence Lee ever spoke up against it. On the contrary, he darkly intimated in his interview with the Herald that the South might be moved to violence again if peace did not proceed on its terms.
