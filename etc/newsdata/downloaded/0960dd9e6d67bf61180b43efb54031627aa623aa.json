Jos\u00e9 Altuve spoke, then brought his bat to D.C.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cIt was just encouragement to keep playing, and that\u2019s it,\u201d Altuve said coyly.\n\nIt was Altuve who got the Astros back to the World Series with his walk-off home run in Game 6 of the American League Championship Series, and it was Altuve who resurrected his team\u2019s offense to help Houston win Friday\u2019s Game 3 against the Nationals, 4-1. He was 2 for 5 with two doubles and two runs scored.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWashington still has a 2-1 edge in the series, but Houston now has some breathing room.\n\n\u201cThe key was that we stayed confident,\u201d Altuve said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t panic. Yes, the first two games, we didn\u2019t do some things, but we keep believing in us. And guess what? Tonight we went out there and we make it happen.\u201d\n\nA heavy-hitting Astros lineup had struggled at the plate of late, and most problematic was Houston\u2019s output with runners in scoring position. In their eight games entering Friday night, they were 8 for 63 (.127) with runners in scoring position, but desperation jolted Houston into a 4-for-10 showing in Game 3. It helped that they were more aggressive, tallying four steals and hitting early in counts rather than worrying about making Nationals starter An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez throw a lot of pitches.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis team has been doing that the whole season, but I feel like in the postseason, we were just trying too much,\u201d said catcher Robinson Chirinos, who hit a solo home run Friday night. \u201cWe were trying to be a hero, and that\u2019s something we talked about on the plane [Thursday] \u2014 let\u2019s have good at-bats and a good approach as a team and don\u2019t try to do too much.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhile third baseman Alex Bregman, an AL MVP candidate, has acknowledged he has been \u201cterrible\u201d at the plate in the postseason, Altuve has been on a tear, entering Game 3 with a .358 batting average, a .414 on-base percentage and a .717 slugging percentage in October, a welcome change from a year ago when a knee injury had him slumping through the second half of the season.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody has any idea what this guy was going through at this time last year just to get himself ready to play,\u201d Hinch said this week. \u201cIn the ALCS and the ALDS last year he was fighting through a lot. And we have some guys in our clubhouse that are fighting through a lot but not as much as Jos\u00e9\u2019s injured knee last year. So I think he\u2019s huge for our organization on so many levels, from a makeup standpoint, from a clubhouse presence, from the middle-of-the-order-to-top-of-the-order bat to his defense, his energy on the bases.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEverything that\u2019s right about the Astros is Jos\u00e9 Altuve, and he\u2019s our guy. We have a lot of stars on this team. The guy who\u2019s been here the longest, the guy who arguably has the most impact around here is Jos\u00e9. And so to have him playing at an elite level while we\u2019re chasing this World Series title is somewhat expected around here if you\u2019ve been around the Astros and around Jos\u00e9, but it\u2019s remarkable nonetheless.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Astros had a players meeting during the 2017 postseason, too, after the team lost three straight games to the Yankees in the ALCS to land on the brink of elimination. Carlos Beltr\u00e1n and Brian McCann led that one, and it ultimately ended with the franchise\u2019s first championship.\n\n\u201cBecause we lost the first two games, we [weren\u2019t] just going to give up,\u201d Altuve said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the team we are. Tonight we went out there, and we just passed the baton to the next guy. We keep playing.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Houston\u2019s standout second baseman went 2 for 5 with two doubles and two runs in his team\u2019s Game 3 victory over the Nationals.", "authors": ["Isabelle Khurshudyan", "Reporter Covering The Washington Capitals"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QkGC_GyMBLe4rVrS_wCKQzwf84M=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XAVF2YHXVEI6TIUFRAVI4ODKSY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
