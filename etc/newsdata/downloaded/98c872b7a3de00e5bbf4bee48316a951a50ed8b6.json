Right?\" she asked.\n\nHe nodded in agreement with Koike.\n\nKoike said in the next several days she wanted a \"detailed explanation ... that can be understood by the people of Tokyo.\"\n\nCoates, a powerful IOC member and lawyer from Australia who oversees frequent inspections of Tokyo's progress, has repeatedly said the IOC will go ahead with its plans.\n\nHe said he had already told Koike this. But he said the IOC, Koike, representatives from the national government, and local organizers would meet Friday in a working group.\n\nBut again, he suggested it was a done deal.\n\n\"I see this very much as using that political working group to set the framework as to how we implement these changes in a way that is acceptable to everyone,\" Coates said.\n\nOn Tuesday, political allies of Koike in the municipal legislature told a news conference that moving the marathon would cost at least $34 billion yen (about $310 million). Maybe more.\n\nThey also raised questions about who will pay for any changes \u2014 or reimburse Tokyo \u2014 and did not rule out a lawsuit.\n\nTokyo city officials acknowledge the city is hot in the summer. But so were Olympics in Atlanta in 1996 and Athens in 2004. City officials have offered to start the marathon at 5 a.m., which is at sunrise in the Tokyo summer.\n\nEstimates suggest the temperature would be 27 degrees C (81 degrees F) at 5 a.m., and would be 25.4 degrees C (78 degrees F) in Sapporo for a 7 a.m. start.\n\nThe starting temperature in Doha for the women's marathon was 32.7 degrees C (91 degrees F).\n\nTokyo's soaring costs are also a major issue with the Olympics opening on July 24, 2020.\n\nA government audit report last year said Tokyo was spending about $25 billion to organize the Olympics, all of which is public money except for $5.6 billion from a privately financed operating budget.\n\nTokyo said in its bid in 2013 that the Olympics would cost $7.3 billion.\n\nToshiro Mori, the head of the organizing committee and a former Japanese prime minister, acknowledge a few days ago that change could be costly.\n\n\"Our overall cost has become a humongous amount, so it would cause us pain if the cost is added to our bill,\" Mori said. \"So I mentioned that to Mr Coates, and he said he will look into it. We won't be able to pay if it's a significant damage to our finances. I have reminded him of that.\"\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
