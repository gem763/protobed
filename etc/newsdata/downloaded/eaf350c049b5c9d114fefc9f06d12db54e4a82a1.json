Today, I\u2019m going to agree with Crazy Bernie about a moral hazard issue.\n\nShocking, but true. The Vermont socialist actually understands that it makes no sense to subsidize new homes in flood-prone areas.\n\n\"If people want to rebuild in an area which will be devastated by the next storm, they're certainly not going to get federal assistance from my administration.\" -Sen. Sanders on changing FEMA rules to spur a retreat from properties suffering repeated losses. #ClimateTownHall pic.twitter.com/BC47QBZupm \u2014 CNN (@CNN) September 5, 2019\n\nI\u2019ll probably never again have a chance to write this next sentence, so it deserves an exclamation point. Bernie is completely correct!\n\nFlood insurance encourages people to take on excessive risk (i.e., it creates moral hazard). And the subsidies often benefit rich people with beachfront homes (which may explain why Senator Sanders is on the right side)\n\nIf nothing else, politicians are very clever about doing the wrong thing in multiple ways.\n\nSo we\u2019re not merely talking about luring people into flood-prone areas with subsidized insurance.\n\nSometimes government uses rental subsidies to put people in flood-prone areas.\n\nHere are some excerpts from a story in the New York Times.\n\nWhen a deadly rainstorm unloaded on Houston in 2016, Sharobin White\u2019s apartment complex flooded in up to six feet of water. She sent her toddler and 6-year-old to safety on an air mattress, but her family lost nearly everything, including their car. When Hurricane Harvey hit the next year, it happened all over again: Families rushed to evacuate, and Ms. White\u2019s car, a used Chevrolet she bought after the last flood, was destroyed. \u2026But Ms. White and many of her neighbors cannot afford to leave. They are among hundreds of thousands of Americans \u2014 from New York to Miami to Phoenix \u2014 who live in government-subsidized housing that is at serious risk of flooding\u2026 But the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which oversees some of the at-risk properties, does not currently have a universal policy against paying for housing in a designated flood zone. \u2026Nationwide, about 450,000 government-subsidized households \u2014 about 8 to 9 percent \u2014 are in flood plains\u2026\n\nWhile FEMA and government-subsidized flood insurance wouldn\u2019t even exist in my libertarian fantasy world, I\u2019m willing to acknowledge that government sometimes does things that aren\u2019t completely foolish.\n\nFor instances, it\u2019s better to subsidize people to move out of flood-prone areas instead of subsidizing them to rebuild in those areas.\n\nNashville is trying to move people\u2026away from flood-prone areas. The voluntary program uses a combination of federal, state and local funds to offer market value for their homes. If the owners accept the offer, they move out, the city razes the house and prohibits future development. The acquired land becomes an absorbent creekside buffer, much of it serving as parks with playgrounds and walking paths. \u2026While a number of cities around the country have similar relocation projects to address increased flooding, disaster mitigation experts consider Nashville\u2019s a model that other communities would be wise to learn from: The United States spends far more on helping people rebuild after disasters than preventing problems. \u2026research shows that a dollar spent on mitigation before a disaster strikes results in at least six dollars in savings. There are many reasons more people end up rebuilding in place than moving away. Reimbursement is relatively quick, while FEMA\u2019s buyout programs tend to be slow and difficult to navigate.\n\nWhile it\u2019s encouraging to see a better approach, we wouldn\u2019t need to worry about the issue if government got out of the business of subsidizing flood insurance.\n\nWhich helps to explain why the Wall Street Journal expressed disappointment last year when Republicans blew a golden opportunity to fix the program.\n\nOne disappointment you can count on is a GOP failure to fix one of the worst programs in government: taxpayer subsidized flood insurance. \u2026The Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s flood insurance program was set to expire on Nov. 30, and Congress rammed through a temporary extension to buy more time. Congress was supposed to deal with the program as part of the end-of-the-year rush. The program runs a $1.4 billion annual deficit, which comes from insurance priced too low to compensate for the risk of building homes near water. Congress last year forgave $16 billion of the program\u2019s $24 billion debt to Treasury, not that anyone learned anything. The program then borrowed another $6 billion. \u2026If Republicans can\u2019t fix this example of failed government because it might upset parochial interests, they deserve some time in the political wilderness.\n\nIn other words, Bernie Sanders is better on this issue than last year\u2019s GOP Congress.\n\nI\u2019ve criticized Republicans on many occasions, but this must rank as the most damning comparison.\n\nBut let\u2019s set aside politics and partisanship.\n\nWhat matters is that the federal government is operating an insanely foolish program that puts people at risk, soaks taxpayers, and destroys wealth.\n\nGee, maybe Reagan was right when he pointed out that government is the problem rather than the solution.", "description": "Something really strange is happening.
