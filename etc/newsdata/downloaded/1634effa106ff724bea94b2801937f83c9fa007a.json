Once all was said and done, two youthful Liverpool and Arsenal teams had treated Anfield to 10 goals, five-a-piece; some were sublime, others ridiculous, but all nothing if not entertaining.\n\nJoe Willock\u2019s 70th-minute strike \u2013 a brilliant, curling effort from 25 yards - fell into the former category and worthy of deciding such an entertaining spectacle but Divock Origi had other ideas. In the fourth-minute of five added-on, his overhead kick into the Kop end resulted in a penalty shoot-out.\n\nLiverpool ultimately progressed to the League Cup quarter-finals thanks to a faultless record from the spot \u2013 completed by local prodigy Curtis Jones - and a crucial save by Cork-born goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher. A Republic of Ireland Under-21 international, his decisive stop from Dani Ceballos will surely be the highlight of his Anfield career.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The defender \u2013 the only Arsenal player who could potentially lose to Xhaka in a popularity contest \u2013 misjudged the path of the ball, which deflected in off his trailing leg as he attempted a sliding clearance.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

And if the exuberance of youth had helped Liverpool at one end, the attendant naivety and inexperience hindered them at the other. Arsenal equalised, took the lead and then doubled it in the space of 17 minutes.\n\nLucas Torreira\u2019s first looked offside, in fairness, but Liverpool had several opportunities to clear the danger before Mesut Ozil\u2019s square pass found Bukayo Saka unmarked inside the penalty area. Kelleher parried Saka\u2019s attempt straight at Torreira, who converted at close-range.\n\nKelleher\u2019s role in the second was also questionable. When Ainsley Maitland-Niles\u2019s daisy-cutting cross deflected awkwardly off Sepp van den Berg, the 20-year-old parried again. Martinelli was the grateful recipient, finishing high into the net from no more than a yard or two out.\n\nThere is a great excitement in north London about Martinelli, who scored twice on his full debut in the previous round against Nottingham Forest. The 18-year-old ensured he would end the night with at least another brace again when Saka pounced on Harvey Elliott\u2019s lose touch and found the Martinelli unmarked at the far post.\n\nUnless Liverpool found some semblance of defensive shape and organisation, the game risked running away from them. A 33-year-old James Milner provided the steady hand on the tiller at the end of the first half, converting a penalty won by Elliott, who drew a cheap foul from Martinelli.\n\nYears of experience are no barrier against mistakes. At the start of the second half, Milner made perhaps the most egregious error of the evening, under-cooking a pass to Kelleher. Maitland-Niles nipped in and nudged the ball around the goalkeeper, accepted a return from Ozil then poked into an unguarded net.\n\nAt 4-2 with a little over half an hour remaining, there was still plenty of time for Arsenal to surrender their lead. It lasted all of eight minutes, in fact. Oxlade-Chamberlain reduced the arrears and scored against his former club for the first time when he ended a bout of midfield head tennis with a vicious, dipping shot from range.\n\nParity was then restored shortly after the hour mark by Origi, who took the ball from teenage substitute Curtis Jones, turned Rob Holding easily on the edge of the area then unleashed a shot that goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez helped into his own net.\n\nAgain, 10 minutes could not pass without a goal. Willock\u2019s brilliant strike brought about a period of relative calm and appeared to have finally settled matters. Then came Origi\u2019s overhead, Kelleher\u2019s save from Ceballos and Jones composed spot-kick which finally, mercifully, brought the evening\u2019s scoring to an end.", "description": "This meeting between two of English football\u2019s most illustrious clubs often resembled a playground kickabout in more ways than one.
