An Amazon representative told Business Insider that the company does not comment on rumors or speculation. However, the evidence is mounting that the retailer is advancing with these plans.\n\nOver the past few months, Amazon has also posted several job listings for store designers. In one recent posting, first spotted by The New York Times, it said that it is seeking a candidate to join a team that is \"developing creative solutions\" for a \"retail concept\" that houses \"multiple customer experiences under one roof.\"\n\nAccording to The Journal, the new stores will be about 35,000 square feet, which is smaller than a traditional grocery store. These new locations may create an experience that is targeted at more mainstream customers, unlike Whole Foods, which would enable it to directly compete with big-box stores such as Walmart, Target, and Kroger.", "description": "The new stores will reportedly be distinct from\u00a0Whole Foods, carrying a larger variety of food, and may or may not carry the Amazon name.", "authors": ["Mary Hanbury"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9341a72e22af3b49267435?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
