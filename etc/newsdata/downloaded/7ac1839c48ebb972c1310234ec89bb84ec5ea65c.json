A summary of the leaders\u2019 call released earlier in the day revealed Trump asked Zelensky to investigate 2020 Democratic presidential contender Biden. Trump made the request while discussing U.S. military aid to Ukraine.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Tuesday called for a formal impeachment inquiry in the wake of the allegations that Trump urged a foreign power to go after his political rival.\n\nWhen a reporter asked Trump Wednesday if he would like Zelensky to continue investigating Biden, Trump said he wanted him \u201cto do whatever he can.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want him to do whatever he can, this was not his fault, he wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Trump said of Zelensky. \u201cBut whatever he can do in terms of corruption, because corruption\u2019s rampant. Now when Joe Biden\u2019s son walks away with millions of dollars from Ukraine and he knows nothing and they\u2019re paying him millions of dollars, that\u2019s corruption.\u201d\n\nWhen a reporter asked Trump Wednesday if he would like Zelensky to continue investigating Biden, Trump said he wanted him \u201cto do whatever he can.\u201d\n\nTrump was referring to a Ukrainian investigation into Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings while he was serving on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. The Ukrainian prosecutor in the case found no evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nTrump then pivoted to former 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, saying they should be investigated. He accused the U.S. government of being \u201ccorrupt,\u201d defended using his personal lawyer as an envoy to Ukraine, and said Zelensky should give more money to the U.S.\n\nHe then attacked Pelosi for opening an impeachment investigation.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s lost her way,\u201d Trump said of Pelosi. \u201cShe\u2019s been taken over by the radical left.\u201d\n\nHe ended by saying that Pelosi is no longer speaker of the House.
