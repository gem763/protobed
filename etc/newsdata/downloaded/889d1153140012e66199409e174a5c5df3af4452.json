Period.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna respond to that,\u201d he continued, voice raised, as he jabbed a finger at the reporter. \u201cLet\u2019s focus on the problem, focus on this man, what he\u2019s doing, that no president has ever done. No president!\u201d\n\nIt was the second time in two weeks that Biden berated a journalist for querying him about his son\u2019s Ukraine entanglements.\n\n\u201cYou should be looking at Trump,\u201d Biden barked during a Sept. 21 press gaggle. \u201cAsk the right question.\u201d\n\n\u201cBiden bullies the press,\u201d wrote Matt Wolking, the Trump campaign\u2019s deputy communications director, in an emailed statement. \u201cQuid Pro Joe clearly has no good explanation for what many independent observers say was an obvious conflict of interest.\u201d\n\nTrump retweeted a Fox News segment on the video Saturday.\n\nAs House Democrats aim their impeachment inquiry at Trump, the investigation has cast a spotlight on Ukraine and its long history of government corruption.\n\nBiden in 2016 allegedly threatened to rescind Ukraine\u2019s $1 billion in loan guarantees if the government didn\u2019t oust Viktor Shokin, the country\u2019s top prosecutor, who had targeted Burisma.\n\nBiden denies the story, but the charge continues to dog him. A Monmouth poll released Tuesday found 43% of Americans believe it \u2014 and that\u2019s had an impact on his primary campaign.\n\nBiden was the clear front runner in May, when he held a commanding 27-point advantage over second-place Sen. Bernie Sanders, but he now hold just a two-point lead over Sen. Elizabeth Warren, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average.\n\nAnd Warren tops him in the two most recent national polls, both released Wednesday.\n\nBiden\u2019s fundraising is also flagging. Third-quarter figures released this week show that he pulled in $15.2 million in the last three months, a haul that placed him a distant fourth behind Sanders\u2019 $25.3 million, Warren\u2019s $24.6 million and South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s $19.1 million.", "description": "CBS News reporter Bo Erickson set Joe Biden off when he asked whether son Hunter Biden\u2019s lucrative job with an oil company owned by an oligarch accused of corruption posed a conflict of interest for Biden.", "authors": ["October"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/joe-biden-finger-pointing.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
