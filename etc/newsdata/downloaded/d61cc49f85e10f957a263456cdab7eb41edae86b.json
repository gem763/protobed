We invest in transparent companies with good governance, real or rather cash backed earnings and a skilled management team whose incentives align them with us as minority shareholders. Activist shorts seem to target companies that have deficiencies in these areas, so to date we have always watched these battles from the sidelines.\n\nWhat's the thinking behind adding Collins Foods as a position? Do you eat KFC?\n\nFirst of all, the strength of the KFC brand and marketing programs should drive continued same store sales growth from their network of KFC restaurants around Australia. KFC\u2019s price point in the market and emphasis on value is important, I believe it will prove more robust than other consumer discretionary stocks should there be a further slowdown in consumer spending.\n\nSecondly, incoming CEO Drew O\u2019Malley is very impressive and his experience managing and growing QSR [quick service restaurant] operations in Europe is very important. Collins\u2019 operations in Germany and the Netherlands have been problematic recently, Drew\u2019s experience should help with the turn around. If successful, Europe could become a meaningful earnings driver for the business.\n\nAnd finally, Collins have exclusive rights to roll out 50 Taco Bell sites across Queensland and Victoria. they have opened six stores in Queensland already. The Taco Bell roll out should contribute a large percentage of their earnings growth over the next couple of years.\n\nHonestly, I try not to eat too much fast food but from memory the chips are good.\n\nHow are you managing positions such as Appen amid this rotation to value?\n\nAt Lennox we manage a concentrated portfolio of our best investment ideas. Our core competency lies in identifying compelling small cap investments and so we want our thirty high conviction investment ideas to be the driver of the fund\u2019s returns. This all sounds obvious, but it requires identifying and mitigating macroeconomic and growth or value (otherwise known as factor) risks in the portfolio. We devote a large amount of time and employ significant systems to do this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur position in Appen reflects both our conviction in the investment thesis but also its contribution to different portfolio risks. The rotation to value hasn\u2019t required us to adjust any position as the portfolio is already constructed with these risks in mind.\n\nHave you looked at the Tyro float and do you think it will get away?\n\nNo, I haven\u2019t looked at the Tyro float closely yet. There is a long list of questions that I would need answered before I could give you an opinion on whether it will get away.\n\nWe're always looking for new TV to stream. Anything new or old caught your eye?\n\nI\u2019m terrible with sticking to a series. I mainly watch professional surfing and AFL with my son, who I have recruited to be a Carlton fan, and there\u2019s a very funny cooking show on Netflix called Nailed It! that I watch with my kids.\n\nFinally, a recommendation for a good value quick bite in Sydney?\n\nI love pizza and Vacanza in Charing Cross near Bronte is one of my favourites. Their prawn and chilli pizza with a beer or a red wine is hard to beat.", "description": "AFR Markets Live talks with Lennox Capital Partners principal James Dougherty about why he only owns one WAAAX stock and how he avoids activist shorts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3029%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_208/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/36119438dc20b7faec0f341b53381cbf5cf89252", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
