When I was thinking about doing this I figured it was time to kind of understand the world [of Instagram] and dip my toe into the social media pool.\u2019\n\nHer debut on Instagram actually broke Guinness World Records, beating even Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s account for racking up a million followers in just five hours and 16 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJennifer admitted that the reason she decided to finally succumb to the \u2018Gram is that people kept asking her to create an account so she finally gave in.\n\nShe explained: \u2018I\u2019m like the most reluctant person to join Instagram. What you resist, persists so what the hey, just do it.\n\nJennifer crashed her Instagram account with this photo of the whole Friends cast back together (Picture: Instagram)\n\n\u2018I\u2019m just trying to build content as they say. I\u2019m going to try to be really good about it.\u2019\n\nJen also admitted she panicked when she realised she would have to post more than just her record-breaking first image: \u2018After yesterday, I was like \u201cI have to do more now I guess?!\u201d This is now a big thing.\u2019\n\nHer second post was almost as epic as the first, showing her smashing her phone after her first photo crashed her account as so many people tried to click on her profile.\n\nWe can\u2019t wait to see what she\u2019s got for us next.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
