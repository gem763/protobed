Advocates say the church hides behind the distinction.\n\nMadigan's report said church officials looked for reasons not to deem an allegation credible, including looking for ways to discredit survivors.\n\n\"We have long taken issue with the term 'credible,'\" the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) said in a statement.\n\n\"The threshold for what is and what is not 'credible' changes from diocese to diocese, meaning there is no clarity, precision, or usefulness to the term.\"\n\nThe results of the ongoing Illinois investigation, which began in August, are still preliminary and more revelations are expected.\n\nThe investigation came on the heels of an August grand jury report out of Pennsylvania that found more than 300 suspected predator priests and more than 1 000 victims had been covered up for decades.\n\nThat report spurred criminal investigations in approximately a dozen states and the launch of the first federal probe into the Pennsylvania dioceses.\n\n\"State governments, such as Illinois, simply do not trust the Catholic Church to follow through on its promises and move toward greater transparency and accountability,\" Schmalz said.\n\nAs bishops plan to meet in Chicago to address the crisis, he said they face \"the real possibility of having to cede investigative authority and oversight to authorities outside the Church\".\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "US bishops preparing for a meeting to address the sexual abuse scandal roiling the Catholic Church suddenly find themselves in a high-stakes credibility test following a damning report accusing them of underplaying the crisis.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/479/d29149e7e63c4e8d869589f395cb3a2a.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-21"}
