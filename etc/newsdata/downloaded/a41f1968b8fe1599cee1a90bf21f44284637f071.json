We will fight to overcome this roadblock that would compromise the integrity of our legal action.\u201d\n\nThe NRA disputed the James\u2019s claim that it is blocking access to Ackerman McQueen documents.\n\n\u201cFalsely and disingenuously, the Attorney General\u2019s filing claims that the NRA is blocking access to documents possessed by its former ad agency,\u201d William Brewer III, counsel to the NRA, told The Hill. \u201cIn fact, the NRA told Ackerman McQueen to produce everything the AG sought \u2014 after giving the NRA a chance to redact privileged information. That, of course, is a tried and true approach routinely followed where, as here, a civil subpoena to a third party implicates a principal\u2019s confidential documents.\u201d\n\nBrewer added, \u201cThis is not a dispute about whether Attorney General James can access NRA-related documents. It\u2019s a dispute about whether she can do so secretly, in a manner designed to circumvent the NRA\u2019s clear legal rights \u2014 including the right to protect our members\u2019 personal information from a political witch hunt.\u201d\n\nAckerman McQueen declined to comment on the suit.\n\nThe probe into the NRA was launched after the group's former president, Oliver North Oliver Laurence NorthNew York sues NRA's former ad agency over subpoena NRA paid for flights for chief executive's relatives: report Trump called NRA chief to tell him universal background checks are off the table: report MORE, alleged that CEO Wayne LaPierre used the NRA to enrich himself. LaPierre denied the accusation and North was ousted from the organization.\n\nThe NRA subsequently targeted North and Ackerman McQueen in separate lawsuits.\n\n\u2014Updated at 2:42 p.m.", "description": "New York Attorney General Letitia James on Monday sued the National Rifle Association's (NRA) former advertising agency to enforce a subpoena\u00a0related to the gun group's nonprofit status.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/nra_041015getty_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
