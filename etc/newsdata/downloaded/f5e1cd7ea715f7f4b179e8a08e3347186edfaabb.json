We do this at the grocery store, too.\u201d\n\nThe kitchen also offers lots of basic science lessons when it comes to chemistry. Discuss why baking powder makes things rise or why we need hot temperatures in the oven to cook.\n\nIt is a great way to learn about nutrition\n\n\"When kids are involved in meal and snack preparation, they learn about the importance and value of eating whole foods (instead of processed foods) and preparing their food from scratch,\" says Sarah Remmer, a Calgary dietitian and nutrition blogger.\n\nIt also gives kids the knowledge and tools they need to feel confident preparing nutritious food for themselves in the future.\n\nWhen kids get up close and personal with their food, they start learning about variety and balance in their food choices. They also grow their palate and creativity by exploring different flavour combinations.\n\nPlus, cooking and baking show kids the building blocks of their favourite recipes. Seeing raw ingredients transformed into something new can be mind-blowing. This is an important lesson for kids with food allergies \u2014 it reminds them that they can\u2019t always see the peanuts, so they need to ask.\n\nYou'll Also Love: How To Make Your Own Pasta\n\nIt reinforces important lessons about staying safe\n\nKitchens can be full of dangers \u2014 sharp objects, heavy pots, very hot surfaces. It's key to have safety talks before and during time in the kitchen with kids.\n\nParents will have their own rules for what kids can and can't do in the kitchen. What do you feel comfortable with?\n\n\u201cSince my son was only three when we started our baking adventures, he was not allowed near the oven when things were going in or coming out,\u201d says Jillian Kendall, a mother of three in Toronto. As kids get older and more comfortable in the kitchen, they can start using the oven, stove and sharp knives with supervision.\n\nThe kitchen is a great place to teach kids about hygiene too \u2014 how to wash hands and properly handle certain ingredients, like raw eggs.\n\nIt\u2019s a great way for families to bond\n\nFor many busy families, getting kids involved with cooking starts out as a necessity and then becomes a treasured bonding activity \u2014 whether it\u2019s passing down old family recipes or creating new ones.\n\n\u201cWe started around age two with my son. I was trying to figure out a way to have him near and safe and part of the action, but without catching or starting fires [during dinner prep],\" says Yvonne Gomez, a Port Coquitlam mom of two. She built him a kitchen observation tower after finding instructions online.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s more involved now. Things get really messy and I have let go of that. Measurements are more approximations as preschoolers have fast ninja moves,\u201d she says. \u201cHe loves it because it\u2019s like roleplay and he\u2019s proud to share his work with his dad and grandparents, and I love it because he will listen and focus.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd, of course, we both love the outcome \u2014 getting to eat all the food!\u201d", "description": "Planning, patience, science and math: just a few of the life skills kids learn when they hang out in the kitchen.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/parents/content/imgs/_8col/cookingwithkids_lead_123rf.jpg", "published_at": "2016-04-04"}
