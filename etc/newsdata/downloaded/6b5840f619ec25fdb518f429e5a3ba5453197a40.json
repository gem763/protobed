(AP) - Arizona State picked up some impressive wins in coach Herm Edwards\u2018 first season, knocking off Michigan State, Southern California and rival Arizona.\n\nThe Sun Devils opened this season by beating two teams they were supposed to beat.\n\nWhat they did over the weekend may have pushed them into the next echelon.\n\nPoised down the stretch and solid defensively all afternoon, Arizona State picked up the marquee win of the Edwards era by knocking off then-No. 18 Michigan State on the road.\n\nHow did the 24th-ranked Sun Devils do it? By taking cues from their even-keel coach.\n\n\u201cI get it all the time: \u2018Coach, you just kind of always stay like this (drawing a flat line),\u2019\u201d Edwards said Monday. \u201cI say yeah, I have to because I have to make decisions. I don\u2019t get caught up in all that other stuff. We want them to be emotional, but I don\u2019t want people emotional. I want people passionate because when you get emotional, you make errors. You just do.\u201d\n\nThe win in East Lansing puts the Sun Devils (3-0) in a familiar position.\n\nA year ago, Arizona State beat UTSA in its opening game and drew national attention by knocking off Michigan State in Tempe.\n\nThe Sun Devils followed that up with a disappointing loss to San Diego State, another to Washington the following week on the way to a 7-6 season.\n\nArizona State opened this season with wins over Kent State and Sacramento State then had another national attention-grabbing win by beating Michigan State 10-7 on Saturday.\n\nThe goal now is to avoid the repeat letdown, starting with Saturday\u2019s Pac-12 opener against Colorado at home.\n\n\u201cLast year we were in a similar spot. We had some success and then we got our nose punched in, so we\u2019ll find out,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAll the warning signs are there and I\u2019m going to talk about it all week, then we\u2019re going to go in the ball yard and find out.\u201d\n\nSo far, Arizona State has shown signs it can handle the attention.\n\nDespite starting a freshman at quarterback and at two offensive line spots, the Sun Devils have yet to wilt under pressure.\n\nThe opening two wins against smaller-conference schools were not perfect, but had the expected outcomes.\n\nAgainst Michigan State, defense kept the Sun Devils in the game and Jayden Daniels, the freshman quarterback, made the plays when his team needed it most.\n\nArizona State\u2019s offense labored all afternoon, but Daniels orchestrated a scoring drive with his arms and legs. Playing with the poise of a much older player, he picked the Spartans apart passing and twice had big gains to keep the drive alive, including a scramble for a first down on fourth-and-13. Eno Benjamin scored the go-ahead touchdown on a 1-yard run and Arizona State avoided overtime when Michigan State\u2019s Matt Coghlin missed a 42-yard field goal on a re-kick - he made the first one - after the Spartans were penalized for having 12 men on the field.\n\n\u201cThere was not a doubt in his mind for him that they were going to be able to move the ball,\u201d Edwards said of Daniels. \u201cThat\u2019s how he felt, but that\u2019s who the kid is.\u201d\n\nThe Sun Devils haven\u2019t been winning pretty, but it\u2019s been out of necessity. With young players in key spots, the offense is still trying to find solid footing.\n\nArizona State\u2019s defense has given them the chance, holding the first three opponents to a combined 21 points, giving the Sun Devils a shot at winning every game even when the offense has been uneven.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all you want, you just give yourself a chance,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThat\u2019s football. Just give yourself a chance. Don\u2019t muck it up. Just give yourself a chance. And that\u2019s hard for young kids because they don\u2019t understand that sometimes. They were good enough to figure it out and we got out of there with a win.\u201d\n\nThe next chance comes Saturday. The Sun Devils don\u2019t want to muck it up.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Arizona State picked up some impressive wins in coach Herm Edwards' first season, knocking off Michigan State, Southern California and rival Arizona.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Marshall"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/arizona_st_michigan_st_football_29657_c0-158-3006-1910_s1770x1032.jpg?ba40118f679f98c0ed171610de0cc5f25dd40e2d", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
