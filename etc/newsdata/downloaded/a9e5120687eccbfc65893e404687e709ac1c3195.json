There were a couple of times when we took a couple sacks, the fumbles, some of that loose stuff. We can work on that, there\u2019s drills for that. There\u2019s stuff that he did in the game, there\u2019s not drills for that. We believed in him from the day we drafted him and first time out, he didn\u2019t disappoint.\u201d\n\nBut Jones wasn\u2019t the only story line from Sunday\u2019s win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Star running back Saquon Barkley suffered a high-ankle sprain on a tackle by Tampa Bay\u2019s Mike Edwards in the second quarter and could miss as many as eight weeks. Backup running back Wayne Gallman managed 13 yards on five carries in his absence, perhaps signaling a downturn for the Giants\u2019 offense over the next two months.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEli Manning would lower the standard for Hall of Fame quarterbacks\n\nBut the truth is, New York could blossom with Jones under center, even with Barkley on the sidelines. At the very least, this team should be decoupled from its run-based offense and liberated to embrace a modern NFL offensive approach, with all the benefits that go with it.\n\nIn 2018, the play the Giants used most often on first and second downs was a rushing attempt by Barkley. Such attempts accounted for more than a third of the Giants\u2019 first-and-10 opportunities despite never appearing among the team\u2019s most successful plays \u2014 a Football Outsiders metric based on the down and distance of each play. More than a third of New York\u2019s second-and-short (one to three yards to go) and second-and-medium (four to seven yards needed for a first down) snaps were also carries by Barkley, but the team\u2019s most successful plays in these situations were either short-yardage attempts by Gallman or passing plays to former wideout Odell Beckham Jr., tight end Evan Engram or former tight end Scott Simonson.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBarkley was still the team\u2019s most-used option on first-and-10 snaps during Weeks 1 and 2 of 2019, both losses. But in Week 3, passes to Sterling Shepard were both more common and more successful. Jones and Shepard connected on 4 of 6 first-down targets for 31 yards. Barkley was deemed successful on just 45 percent of his first-and-10 rushing attempts during the first three weeks of the season.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nImproving your success rate with more passing plays isn\u2019t a new concept. As the league has evolved, teams have steadily increased their passing attempts per game, as well as their points scored per game. NFL teams can expect to score 11.8 more points than average per 100 passing attempts based on the down, distance and field position of each throw (per data from TruMedia) but 5.3 fewer points than average per 100 rushing snaps, a huge disparity many teams exploit. If the Giants are committed to a more pass-heavy approach with Jones under center, they can now be one of the those teams.\n\nJenkins: Daniel Jones isn't going to tell you you're wrong about him. He'd rather show you.\n\nEven the mix of passes thrown by Jones in his debut was noticeably different from how Manning attacked the field. In the first two games of the season, Manning targeted his receivers an average of seven yards past the line of scrimmage, with nearly a quarter of his throws directed at or behind the line of scrimmage. Jones targeted his receivers almost 10 yards past the line of scrimmage on average, with half as many throws directed at or behind the line of scrimmage. Jones already has almost as many deep shots (six pass attempts traveling at least 20 or more yards) as Manning (eight) despite 49 fewer attempts overall.\n\n\u201cDaniel Jones did exactly what he needed to do,\u201d Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre said on his weekly Sirius XM NFL Radio program. \u201cHe did exactly what they had hoped he would do given that opportunity. \u2026 The kid played great and did a heck of a job in a lot of different ways.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cReally, from a debut standpoint, it couldn\u2019t have gone any better.\u201d\n\nFor Giants fans hoping for a more dynamic offensive approach, Favre was exactly right. And that should be good news for the team, even with one of the NFL\u2019s best running backs on the sidelines.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Patriots have been perfect, but another 16-0 season is unlikely\n\nBest bets for NFL Week 4: Vikings and Jaguars cover thanks to their pass rushes\n\nCase Keenum is expected to start for Redskins vs. Giants after returning to practice\n\nEagles-Packers provided a showcase for the wisdom and the folly of the pass interference replay rule\n\nhis NFL season has been filled with injuries and controversies.
