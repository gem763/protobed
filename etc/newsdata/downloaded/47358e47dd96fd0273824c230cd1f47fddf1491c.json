A shower or two could accompany it, but they aren\u2019t enough to dent our dry conditions.\n\nEXPRESS FORECAST\n\nToday: Occasional cloudiness. A shower possible. Highs: Near 70 to the mid-70s.\n\nTonight: Rather cloudy. A couple showers? Lows: Mid-40s to mid-50s.\n\nTomorrow: Partly to mostly cloudy. A few showers around.

Often that means we\u2019ve got a chance of some rain. Unfortunately, given the growing drought, any of that should be minimal and rather hit-or-miss. The main thing this front does is turn it a bit cooler for Sunday and add some extra clouds to the sky. By Monday, it\u2019s warm and sunny again.\n\nGet our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device.

Out ahead of the front we\u2019re still in rather warm air, as highs rise to and past 70. We could head to the mid-70s again if clouds and showers are minimal and the front is on the slow side. That\u2019s not a bad bet, although some sprinkles are possible early and then maybe a few showers late. It could be another case where most spots stay dry. Winds are out of the south in the morning and flip to the northwest late afternoon or during the evening. About 5 to 10 mph, regardless of direction. Perhaps a bit gusty behind the front. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTonight: The cold front isn\u2019t in a hurry to move and it\u2019s eventually going to die out nearby. We deal with partly to mostly cloudy skies and some showers may try to ride along it heading into the night. Any of this activity is light, and probably favoring south and east overall. Lows are in the mid-40s to mid-50s. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for the latest updates. For related traffic news, check out Gridlock.

Partly it doesn\u2019t get far, partly it\u2019s washing out, and partly a little wave of low pressure is riding along it. For us this mostly means temperatures are a notch cooler than recent days. Any rain should tend to focus east of Interstate 95, and it won\u2019t be a lot. Highs end up in the mid-to-upper 60s most spots. Winds turn back to the south with time. Confidence: Medium\n\nTomorrow night: Odds of some showers may bump upward a bit for the evening area-wide. It\u2019s still the case that whatever falls is generally light and not too consequential when it comes to our ongoing drought. Lows range from the upper 40s to mid-50s. Confidence: Medium\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nWe\u2019re likely back to nice weather for Monday. Particularly good if you\u2019ve got the day off! Some clouds could linger into the morning but we trend sunny pretty quick if so. Highs head toward the mid-70s or thereabouts. Confidence: Medium\n\nAnother (dry) cold front passes Monday night, which sets up a seasonably cool start to Tuesday. Despite plentiful sunshine, temperatures only make the mid-and-upper 60s. That\u2019s also not far from normal for the time of year. Confidence: Medium", "description": "Any showers are few and far between.
