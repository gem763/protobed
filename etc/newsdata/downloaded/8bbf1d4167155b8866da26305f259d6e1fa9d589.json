And that doesn't even include world championships and other titles. But their accomplishments are only part of the story.\n\nEarly on, Canadians were captivated by Virtue and Moir's relationship as observed in their programs on the ice. It didn't seem to matter which program you watched, the idea that you had somehow come upon a private moment between two people is how I can best describe Virtue and Moir's skating.\n\nWATCH | Virtue and Moir win gold in Vancouver 2010:\n\nWatch Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir's gold medal ice dance skate from the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. 6:26\n\nThat care, commitment and courtesy extended to how they presented themselves off the ice. The idea of a relationship between two equals was irresistible and we ate it up.\n\nThat Virtue and Moir have been able to walk a fine line between mystery and accessibility throughout their career has been part of their appeal. I don't know of two more gracious athletes in victory and defeat. Away from the cameras, they have taken care to respect and acknowledge their fans.\n\nNone of this is to say that these two aren't serious artists or intensely competitive. They are. Their careers and their programs have run the gamut from sweet and innocent, like their Vancouver 2010 gold-winning routine, to Mahler's Fifth Symphony, to their sultry Carmen and most recently, their unabashedly strong Moulin Rouge winning routine in Pyeongchang in 2018.\n\nWATCH | More gold in Pyeongchang 2018:\n\nThe Canadian duo reigned supreme in South Korea. 2:20\n\nWinning is the goal and is in the heart of every athlete. Every figure skating season starts with the hope that the pre-season work leading into competition will be enough to capture the judges' attention. What separates Virtue and Moir from the rest is their willingness to take risks artistically and satisfy themselves first.\n\nOn their Twitter video announcing they were retiring, Moir mentioned how lucky they were to have shared their career with everyone. Truth be told, we were the lucky ones.\n\nThank you very much. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/VirtueMoir?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#VirtueMoir</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/XXII?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#XXII</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/kLzQHSe4eq\">pic.twitter.com/kLzQHSe4eq</a> \u2014@ScottMoir\n\nThe Canadian identity for many includes qualities of humility, grace under pressure and fearlessness. Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir took those ingredients, added a few more and invited Canadian fans to share in the result. If Virtue and Moir wore jerseys on their backs, now would be the time to retire their numbers and hang them from the rafters in their honour.\n\nThanks for the memories.", "description": "The idea of a relationship between two equals was irresistible and as Canadians, we ate it up.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5288617.1568831890!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/921060838.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-18"}
