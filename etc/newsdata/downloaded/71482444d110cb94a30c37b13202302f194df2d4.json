Yet also sublimely skilful and talented.\n\nI was reminded of that last weekend when Keane made pointed comments about Liverpool and Manchester United players displaying touchy-feely friendship in the tunnel before their match.\n\nWhat Roy said was: \u2018I\u2019m disgusted with the players. You\u2019re going to war, yet they\u2019re hugging and kissing.\n\nOwen Farrell is hard as nails, incredibly competitive, uncompromising, fiery and combative\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t even look at the opposition. You\u2019re going into battle against them. The game hasn\u2019t changed that much. The players have changed.\u2019\n\nNow I appreciate this might not be quite \u2018on message\u2019 for some in 2019, but it is unquestionably the reality in the sporting arena and it\u2019s the view I take on such massive occasions. I always get worried before a big game when players are smiley and jokey.\n\nThere is plenty of time to be mates afterwards, with hugs and high fives and hopefully a couple of beers and a bit of craic in the changing room. That is when you demonstrate your friendship and solidarity with a fellow professional in defeat or victory. Long may that be the case.\n\nBefore the match, though, even among firm friends who are opponents for the day, I have always taken the Willie John McBride view and he played in plenty of big matches in his time.\n\nI have always viewed Owen Farrell as a Dogs of War player, a sporting blood brother to Keane\n\n\u2018Beforehand, a match is the most important thing in the world, afterwards it matters not at all,\u2019 was what the Ireland and Lions legend preached.\n\nThis approach sums up Farrell. I\u2019ve met him plenty of times and he is modest, quiet and respectful.\n\nOn the field though, and before the match, he is intense, focused and on the case. He comes from a family of rugby league warriors, it\u2019s in his DNA to consider the rugby field his workplace. You clock on and you clock off. There is plenty of downtime to enjoy in your life but work is work.\n\nWhen I heard Keane\u2019s comments, my mind went back to Murrayfield last year when Farrell had a brief scuffle with Scotland players in the tunnel after their warm-up. As long as it doesn\u2019t spill over to illegality and unpleasantness, I would much rather have my players in that determined mindset than enjoying a mutual love-in.\n\nOwen Farrell gets to grips with Santiago Medrano of Argentina during a RWC Group C game\n\nI copped some stick two years ago for criticising Finn Russell for laughing and joking as the teams lined up before England-Scotland at Twickenham.\n\nIt might be a coincidence, but Scotland were thrashed 61-21.\n\nNo worries with Farrell on that score. He is the heart and soul of the team, he drives them on remorselessly. If England are to win the World Cup, Farrell must produce two stellar games on the bounce. He has done it many times with club and country, and that will be his sole aim now.\n\nFarrell attracted some criticism after the Argentina pool game, which I suspect stemmed from a rare poor afternoon with the boot (four kicks from eight) and that criticism was expanded to take in his general play.\n\nI thought he was absolutely fine and knew for certain that would make his point even more emphatically in the next game. The same would always be the case with Keane, and indeed Bryan Robson and Graeme Souness, who were hewn from the same rock.\n\nThat next match for Farrell was the Australia quarter-final when, operating at fly-half, he totally bossed proceedings.\n\nI was reminded of when Keane made pointed comments about Liverpool and United players\n\nHis goal-kicking was predictably world class after two weeks fine-tuning \u2014 eight out of eight for 20 points. His kicking from hand was excellent, too, and he also made 17 tackles. It was a stunning performance and on most days he would have taken the man-of-the-match award.\n\nI will admit I\u2019ve been torn as to his best position. He is equally good at 10 or 12, so it is other factors that have come into play in that debate. Who starts at inside centre if Farrell starts at No 10? And is that a better mix than starting with George Ford at 10 and Farrell at 12?\n\nMy other concern was that there was a danger of too much responsibility being heaped on one pair of shoulders.\n\nThat fear has fast disappeared. There has been a transformation in Farrell and that goes back to when it became apparent that Dylan Hartley was losing his battle with injury and would not be in the frame for the World Cup. There was a changing of the guard.\n\nKeane is a famous hard man and wasn't one for tunnel niceties, seen before Arsenal away in 07\n\nFarrell was no longer captain elect; he was the main man.\n\nEver since, Farrell has looked and sounded much more at ease with the responsibility of captaincy. This is now his team and he has his generation of players as lieutenants, like his old mate Ford and Jamie George. He sets the tone. When somebody as physical as Farrell works hard to get his tackling fit for purpose there is no excuse for anybody.\n\nFarrell is the gaffer now, just like Keane, Souness and Robson were the gaffers in their day. They bossed it, they drove their teams and took everybody with them.\n\nFarrell is the beating heart of this England team, and if he is stern and unsmiling when the teams run out on Saturday, I will be absolutely delighted.", "description": "SIR CLIVE WOODWARD: Hard as nails, incredibly competitive, uncompromising, fiery and combative.
