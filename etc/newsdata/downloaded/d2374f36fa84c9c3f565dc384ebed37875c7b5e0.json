(Photo: Colleen Hayes, NBC)\n\nThe new TV season is less than a month old, but it's already claimed its first casualty: NBC's low-rated comedy \"Sunnyside,\" which exits after Thursday's fourth episode. But in a digital-era wrinkle, the series will remain in production and stream six remaining episodes online, each Thursday, along with a newly added seventh.\n\nIn its place, NBC plans an early return for \"Will & Grace,\" which was slated to resume early next year for an 11th and final season (and the third since the show was revived in 2017). It will now premiere Oct. 24 in the 9:30 EDT/PDT time slot.\n\n\"Sunnyside\" stars Kal Penn as a disgraced former New York City councilman in Queens who's hired by a diverse group of immigrants to help them navigate their quest for citizenship. It's produced by Michael Schur, a valued NBC producer with a string of successes (\"The Office,\" \"Parks and Recreation\"), critical favorites (\"The Good Place,\" \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\") and a failure or two (last season's \"Abby's.\")\n\nScorecard: Early ratings hits and misses: 'Stumptown,' 'Prodigal Son' lead TV's new season\n\nBut it's been anything but sunny for \"Sunnyside\": The comedy averaged 2.7 million viewers within seven days of its Sept. 26 premiere, making it the least-watched new series in TV's official premiere week. It lost a third of its lead-in audience from niche comedy \"The Good Place.\" Worse, it has dented ratings for \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,\" which follows it. NBC says digital viewership among young adults more than doubled the low \"Sunnyside\" audience. But it was not enough to save the show on TV.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/16/sunnyside-nbc-comedy-first-canceled-show-but-move-online/3988432002/", "description": "NBC's 'Sunnyside' will finish its run online, and 'Will & Grace' is returning early, on Oct. 24, for its final run.", "authors": ["Gary Levin", "Published P.M.
