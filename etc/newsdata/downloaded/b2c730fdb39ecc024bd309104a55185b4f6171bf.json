The teacher was dismissed from his position despite having no other marks against his teaching record.\n\nA professor of history and geography who works in Seine-Saint-Denis, the notorious no-go suburb north of Paris, spoke out about colleagues he suspected may have been radicalised, saying, \u201cThe teaching staff is not immune [to radicalisation]\u201d and adding that he had already seen a Muslim colleague refuse to shake hands with women.\n\n\u201cAs a teacher, I do not have to intervene with the colleague to tell him what to think, what to do,\u201d he said, but added he could inform his superiours asking if such behaviour is what the education system wants to transmit to pupils and others.\n\nRevealed: Islamist Infiltration of French Public Services https://t.co/Y1NmsLrclx \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 21, 2019\n\nThe number of suspected radicalised students dwarfs that of the teachers, with there being as many as a thousand known cases, many concentrated in the \u00cele-de-France region that contains both Paris and Seine-Saint-Denis.\n\nEarlier this year, a report from two French MPs revealed a large concern among public sector workers that their colleagues were also becoming radicalised.\n\nA trade unionist from the RATP, the company in charge of the public transportation system in Paris, claimed that \u201cpractising Muslims are targeting non-practising female believers,\u201d among other behaviours.\n\nPolice are also more concerned than ever about radicalisation following the stabbing attack in a Paris police headquarters by radical Muslim employee Micka\u00ebl Harpon, who killed four people.\n\nSome officers say they have previously been reticent with reporting potentially radicalised colleagues for fear of being branded \u201cIslamophobic\u201d.\n\nParis Police \u2018Disarmed\u2019 After Suspicions of Islamic Radicalisation https://t.co/FAa8Ng7Bsa \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 12, 2019", "description": "French\u00a0Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said at least a dozen Muslim public school teachers have been radicalised.", "authors": ["Chris Tomlinson"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/FRANCE-EDUCATION-SCHOOL.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
