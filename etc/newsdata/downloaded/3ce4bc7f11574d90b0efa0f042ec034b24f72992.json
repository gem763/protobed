It seemed like good, legal fun at the time. It turns out that toke cost US taxpayers five million dollars.\n\nNASA Chief Jim Bridenstine initiated a safety and culture review of SpaceX the moment he found out that Elon Musk, a contractor who holds a top secret security clearance, had been filmed consuming drugs.\n\nPer a report from The Washington Post last year:\n\nThe review was prompted by the recent behavior of SpaceX\u2019s founder, Elon Musk, according to three officials with knowledge of the probe, after he took a hit of marijuana and sipped whiskey on a podcast streamed on the Internet. That rankled some at NASA\u2019s highest levels and prompted the agency to take a close look at the culture of the companies, the people said.\n\nCannabis may be legal for adult recreational use in California, where Musk was during the interview, but it\u2019s illegal at the federal level. In fact, the US government classifies cannabis as a Schedule I drug \u2013 just like heroin and crystal meth. This means, for all intents and purposes, Musk did the legal equivalent of shooting up heroin on live TV. That may sound stupid, and it is, but you can blame the DEA.\n\nNASA\u2019s response to Musk\u2019s illegal use of \u201cdrugs\u201d was to order a safety and culture review of SpaceX and Boeing. Musk has nothing to do with Boeing, but both companies are working on similar projects for NASA.\n\nPolitico today broke the news that NASA restructured the SpaceX contract to include an additional five million dollars worth of payments from the US government to the Musk-helmed company, for the explicit purpose of compensating it for expenses associated with the safety review.\n\nBoeing received no such extra payment.\n\nPer the report:\n\nNASA, for its part, said it is \u201cstandard practice\u201d for a company to receive additional money for work not included in the original contract , but did not directly respond to questions about why it didn\u2019t offer the additional funds to Boeing. Paying a contractor extra to do such a review does not appear to have any precedent, according to several space industry veterans.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to swallow the idea that SpaceX\u2018s contract with NASA didn\u2019t originally have a proviso for \u201csafety\u201d reviews.\n\nAnyway, US taxpayers, here\u2019s what we got for our $5 million:\n\nNASA paid SpaceX for safety review after Musk smoked pot on Politico\n\nRead next: Giphy debuts Arcade, a platform for making and playing 'microgames'", "description": "", "authors": ["Tristan Greene"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fmuskhigh.jpg&signature=26713f95c1d301ea809fba268d1c5d3f", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
