In a move that\u2019s only happened occasionally over the course of the series, the entire installment is devoted to Joanie\u2019s ongoing visit to Montauk in what we can now confirm is the year 2053, ending with her making the big realization that her mother Alison\u2019s death might have been the result of murder.\n\nFor Joanie, though, getting there involves making a new (somewhat annoying) acquaintance, learning an awful lot about Montauk\u2019s history and climate, exploding her marriage, and eventually beginning to process her grief over the loss of her father. It\u2019s very much in line with this show\u2019s character-focused storytelling, in which solving a murder mystery is given the same weight as confronting one\u2019s personal guilt over a father\u2019s death.\n\nWhile Joshua Jackson only appears in flashbacks shot during season four, we still learn an awful lot this week about Cole\u2019s life in the years prior to his death: specifically, his happiness that due to the decline of Montauk, the \u201csummer people\u201d had stopped coming, returning it to the state of a sleepy fishing village. There\u2019s also his devoted love for Joanie (which she found suffocating at times) and his lifelong heartbreak over losing Alison (even at the expense of his second marriage).\n\nMuch of this comes courtesy of EJ (Michael Braun), a local historian who focuses on the families of Montauk, whom Joanie encounters at the cemetery \u2014 when he figures out who she is, he reacts like he\u2019s meeting a rock star. The Lockharts, he says, fascinate him because \u201cthe whole family is steeped in cyclical tragedy,\u201d and he\u2019s not shy about interrogating Joanie for further insight into the past, while also helping her find her own answers.\n\nAlso helping to fill in the gaps is the appearance of a now-decades-older Luisa (the returning Catalina Sandino Moreno, under several pounds of old-age makeup and prosthetics), who appears to be a semi-regular presence in the life of Joanie\u2019s family. It\u2019s not totally clear how much of a role Luisa played in Joanie\u2019s childhood post-Montauk, but the fact that Joanie refers to her as \u201cMom\u201d speaks to both her anger at Alison, the mother she feels abandoned her, as well as her affection for her stepmother. However, their relationship isn\u2019t close enough for Luisa to realize just how damaged Joanie is, as she encourages Joanie to appreciate her \u201cperfect\u201d life, not realizing just how imperfect Joanie finds it to be.\n\nAnna Paquin is in nearly every moment of this episode, and despite the occasional slips into what sounds like a Southern accent (despite learning in this week\u2019s episode that after leaving Montauk she grew up in Vermont), she takes the bluntness of the script and imbues it with a keen sense of nihilistic rage and despair, especially when confronting her husband in the vertical garden.\n\nThe episode\u2019s biggest flaw is that within Joanie as a character are two key threads: her grief over the deaths of her parents, and her grim acceptance of the way climate change has escalated to the point of an extinction-level threat. Anyone keenly following today\u2019s ongoing news cycle can identify with her frustration and terror when Paul tries to be optimistic about their family\u2019s chances of survival on a dying planet \u2014 as a scientist, she has the actual data in front of her to prove her worst fears, and he\u2019s not listening.\n\nThat\u2019s not an excuse to be regularly unfaithful (EJ being the latest example), and certainly not an excuse to throw her infidelity in Paul\u2019s face, leading him to angrily kick her out of the house. Perhaps he has a point, if only because having a mother who feels like she\u2019s \u201cjust shepherding [the kids] towards the apocalypse\u201d can\u2019t be a very healthy situation.\n\nBut it\u2019s tied up in the bad decision-making she\u2019s worried she inherited from her mother, a fear that has haunted her her entire life \u2014 and the way in which her very real and justified fears about the future of the environment interplay with her ongoing internal trauma doesn\u2019t really coalesce here. Simply saying that Joanie is \u201cbroken\u201d doesn\u2019t do justice to what she\u2019s going through, and there\u2019s so much being packed into just these few scenes that it\u2019s hard to really get a grip on everything she\u2019s going through.\n\nThe use of Alison\u2019s voiceover also doesn\u2019t really come together, and if the show is suggesting that a psychic connection between mother and daughter is what leads Joanie to put together the very small number of puzzle pieces necessary to determine that maybe Alison was murdered \u2026 well, that\u2019s quite a stretch.\n\nThe show does make a point of establishing that because of Alison\u2019s history, no one really questioned the idea that she would die by suicide. But in 2021, the police had to have had the same information about the local tides that Joanie pulls up with her AR glasses, and per the case file they even interviewed Benjamin Cruz. It\u2019s not impossible to believe that the cops missed something and despite his own research, Cole was never able to prove that Ben was involved in Alison\u2019s death. But boy, this mystery seems like it got solved quickly.\n\nBy the end of the episode, the implication is that Joanie might be on the way to regaining some level of healing (at the very least, she\u2019s able to enjoy sex with EJ without being choked), while also unlocking the truth about what happened to her mother. It\u2019s not a journey that feels truly earned, but the question of what comes next for everyone involved is enough to keep me engaged. We know the end is coming, and it\u2019ll be fascinating to see just how happy an ending The Affair is capable of.\n\nThere Is No Objective Truth (Just Bullet Points)\n\n\u2022 Not to get too hung up on the timeline, but thanks to Joanie\u2019s AR glasses we learn the exact day of Alison\u2019s death: October 13, 2021 \u2014 as well as the fact that Joanie was 7 years old at the time. This doesn\u2019t quite line up with math based around the Lockhart family gravestones, which suggest that Joanie was born in the year 2016, but at this point it\u2019s probably time to stop overthinking it quite so much.\n\n\u2022 From a 2053 perspective, the movies EJ references or quotes, including Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Singles, Brokeback Mountain, and Moana, range in age from 61 to 37 years. Imagine, in the year 2019, expecting someone to recognize your references to Auntie Mame (1958) or The Secret of NIMH (1982). EJ\u2019s a movie nerd, is what I\u2019m saying.\n\n\u2022 Though EJ\u2019s nerdity will totally be worth it if it turns out that he has a copy of Sasha Mann\u2019s Descent that he and Joanie can watch. That\u2019s some Cloud Atlas\u2013level stuff there. (Yeah, EJ\u2019s not the only movie nerd around.)\n\n\u2022 The sight of the broken miniature garden drone and those moldy strawberries was gut-wrenching, to be honest, given the hope they represented for Joanie\u2019s family. False hope is still hope, sometimes.", "description": "An entire installment devoted to Joanie\u2019s visit to Montauk ends with a big realization about her mother, and perhaps some level of healing.
