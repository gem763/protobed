Pilots aren\u2019t happy with design choices made about 737 MAX flight controls and Congress has summoned CEO Dennis Muilenburg to testify this month.\n\nWall Street, on the other hand, still recommends Boeing shares. Analysts, more comfortable assessing income statements than aerospace designs, seem content to wait and react to MAX news as it trickles out.\n\nMore than 60% of analysts covering the stock rate shares Buy, better than the 55% average Buy-rating ratio for stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. If the MAX never flew again\u2014something no one on Wall Street expects\u2014opinions would surely change. But with an event such as this, investors should realize Wall Street is in the same boat as everyone else\u2014waiting for a complex regulatory drama to play out.\n\nJefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu, for instance, updated her Boeing numbers in a Tuesday research report. She still assumes the MAX resumes flying in the fourth quarter, based on the company\u2019s timeline. As a result, Kahyaogul rates shares Buy with a $430 price target, about 13% higher than recent levels.\n\nEditor's Choice\n\n\u201cNear term, we forecast free cash flow per share of about $6 in 2019, climbing to $31 in 2020 as 737 MAX inventory unwinds and the company re-establishes productivity capture,\u201d Kahyaoglu said in a Tuesday research report. (\u201cProductivity capture\u201d is another way of saying cost cutting.)\n\nBased on the MAX returning, she doesn\u2019t see the long-term earnings power of the aerospace giant disrupted. \u201cFree cash flow outlook appears to sustain a rate of greater than $30 per share from 2020 to 2022.\u201d\n\nFree cash flow should approximate earnings and is preferred by some analysts when valuating companies, especially companies like Boeing that have large noncash charges related to aircraft design and block accounting assumptions\u2014quirks of the aerospace industry. Boeing trade for about 12 times Kahyaoglu\u2019s long-term free cash flow estimates, a level Kahyaoglu believes is attractive.\n\nThe back story. Boeing shares are down about 10% since the second crash of the 737 MAX, involving an Ethiopian Airlines flight. The two fatal crashes, which claimed the lives of 356 people, led to the world-wide grounding of the jet in mid-March.\n\nBoeing believes it can return the plane to service by year-end after making changes to flight-control software, sensors and, potentially, providing more training for pilots.\n\nWhat\u2019s new. Kahyaoglu trimmed her estimates for sales and earnings in 2019, 2021 and 2022. She expects the company to report just $83.6 billion in sales and $3.80 a share in earnings for 2019. But she thinks sales will jump to $122.1 and $117.9 billion in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Earnings jump to $22.53 and $23.87 per share in her model for 2020 and 2021, respectively.\n\nLooking ahead. Of course, the estimates in 2020 and 2021 are dependent on a safe return of the MAX. Wall Street won\u2019t predict what happens to the plane. It will just react to the news, like every other stakeholder.\n\nOctober is shaping up to be a big month for Boeing, with third-quarter earnings due, MAX updates hoped for and Congressional testimony for the CEO.\n\nThe stock was trading near the flat line at $380.54 Tuesday morning, The S&P 500 was down 0.3%.\n\nWrite to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com", "description": "Many stakeholders, including pilots and Congress, don\u2019t seem happy with Boeing.
