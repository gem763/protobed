A total professional, I have no doubt that Dan will do a great job!\"\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Brouillette will replace Rick Perry, who said on Thursday he would step down by the end of the year amid scrutiny over the role he played in the president's dealings with Ukraine, which are currently the subject of an impeachment inquiry.\n\n191017224933652\n\nBrouillette, 57, has taken on increasing responsibilities at the Energy Department in recent months as Perry signalled he would resign. He went on international trips for the department and sat in for Perry during several Cabinet meetings.\n\nBrouillette was vice president at Ford from 2004 to 2006. After that, he headed public policy for United Service Automobile Association which offers insurance and financial services to veterans.\n\nA native of Louisiana, he was a member of the state's Mineral and Energy Board from 2013 to 2016. Before that, he served at the Energy Department as an assistant secretary for congressional and intergovernmental affairs for two years under former President George W Bush.\n\nJoe McMonigle, who was a department chief of staff under Bush, said Brouillette does not have the instincts of a politician like Perry, who had been the longest-serving governor of Texas. But like Perry, Brouillette has an easy relationship with many Democratic and Republican politicans, McMonigle said.\n\nBrouillette, who met with Trump on Friday, is expected to keep pushing the president's policy of maximizing oil, gas and coal output while slashing regulations on energy facilities.\n\n\"I don't know of a single issue where he differs from the president,\" McMonigle said.", "description": "If confirmed, Dan Brouillette, a ex-VP of Ford Motor Co and Louisiana state energy regulator, will replace Rick Perry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/18/0d582ac135a34bb384e1af992329710b_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
