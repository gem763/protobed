Government intervention may be what finally shames ember schools into creating an equitable system for college athletes\u2014or forces them to do so. On Thursday, Booker\u2019s campaign released a \u201cplan to end exploitation in sports.\u201d It would address health, safety, and equity issues at all levels of sports, including the pay disparities protested by the U.S. women\u2019s national soccer team. But Booker would focus most on college athletics. The issue of compensating college athletes\u2014in money, not just in scholarships that don\u2019t cover all of an athlete\u2019s expenses and come with many strings attached\u2014has begun to resonate nationally, and Booker\u2019s plan would, among other things, allow college athletes to be paid for their name and likeness.\n\nBooker is somewhat piggybacking off California\u2019s Fair Pay to Play Act, recently signed by Governor Gavin Newsom. It granted college athletes the ability to make money off their name or likeness starting in 2023. Several other states, such as New York, Florida, and South Carolina, also are considering similar proposals.\n\nThe inequities that pervade college sports are harder and harder to deny. \u201cI think that these are young people that deserve to have fairness, equality and not be exploited, especially when you start looking at its disproportionate impact on the money generating sports, which are disproportionately African-Americans,\u201d Booker told me.\u201d \u201cThe lies that you're told\u2014I remember in season working 60, 70-plus hours a week. There are people that do run scams on [athletes], allowing them to get degrees or to move forward, but then they leave them again without an education. There's a lot of injustice that's going on.\u201d\n\nSo far, though, the NCAA doesn\u2019t seem at all interested in finding some middle ground with college athletes. After the California legislation passed that state\u2019s Senate, the NCAA Board of Governors sent Newsom a letter that simply doubled down on the status quo. In the letter, the board wrote: \u201cIf the bill becomes law and California\u2019s 58 NCAA schools are compelled to allow an unrestricted name, image and likeness scheme, it would erase the critical distinction between college and professional athletics and, because it gives those schools an unfair recruiting advantage, would result in them eventually being unable to compete in NCAA competitions.\u201d The board also said: \u201cThe NCAA has consistently stood by its belief that student-athletes are students first, and they should not be employees of the university.\u201d\n\nThat position might once have sounded reasonable; today, it\u2019s just an excuse for blatantly taking advantage of college athletes. The time most college athletes spend dedicated is practically identical to a professional schedule, particularly in big-revenue sports such as basketball and football. In 2016, Turner Broadcasting and CBS Sports, which had already locked down the rights for the NCAA basketball title game until 2024, agreed to an $8.8 billion contract extension for another eight years\u2014a deal that, for the first time, put the economic value of the tournament at over a billion dollars a year.", "description": "Now a presidential candidate, a former Stanford athlete understands the need to reform big-name college sports.", "authors": ["Jemele Hill", "Staff Writer For"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTX765NJ/facebook.jpg?1570823420", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
