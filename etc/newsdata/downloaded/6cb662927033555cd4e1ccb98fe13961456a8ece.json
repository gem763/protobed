They have lost hope in the system, they don't trust the government,\" she told AFP, requesting anonymity in fear of reprisal.\n\nWhen asked about what she wanted for China as it marks its 70th anniversary, she said: \"I hope we can have the freedom not to be afraid.\"", "description": "China's tightly choreographed 70th birthday bash next week risks being upstaged by pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, which offer a starkly different take on the strength and power of the Communist Party being feted in Beijing.
