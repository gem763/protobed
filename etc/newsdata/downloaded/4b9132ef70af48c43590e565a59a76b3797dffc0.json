They threw rocks at a billboard with his face on it. James was maligned as a narcissist by Dan Gilbert, the owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers, in a letter that was widely mocked.\n\nAnd all James did then was announce on national television that he was going to a different team.\n\nThat was in 2010, when James, after seven seasons in Cleveland, said during a special on ESPN titled \u201cThe Decision\u201d that he was taking his talents to Miami, to play for the Heat.\n\nThe backlash for that was far different from what James, now a member of the Los Angeles Lakers, faces after saying that Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, \u201cwasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand\u201d when he posted and then deleted an image on Twitter supporting pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. It caused an international row with the authoritarian Chinese government, and now threatens the partnership between the N.B.A. and one of its most important international markets. Several Chinese companies cut ties with the Rockets.\n\nJames further incensed his critics when he added: \u201cYes, we do all have freedom of speech. But at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you\u2019re not thinking about others and you\u2019re thinking about yourself.\u201d", "description": "The issues of China and protests in Hong Kong are far different from N.B.A. free agency.
