At the same time, they have also opened a small hole in the secrecy that typically shrouds the special operations community\u2014by giving the local partners who work with those forces a rare and up-close view of who they are and how they do their jobs.\n\nn Syria, elite U.S. troops among the 1,000 American personnel in the country worked closely with Kurdish counterterrorism units while regular Kurdish fighters carried out most of the ground operations against ISIS. The U.S. partnership with the Kurds grew as America armed and trained them and later merged them with Arab groups under an umbrella militia called the Syrian Democratic Forces. The SDF spearheaded the fight against ISIS in Syria, rolling back its most important strongholds. It has said it lost more than 10,000 soldiers in that fight.\n\nRead: The forever war fought by America\u2019 allies\n\nU.S. military officials wasted no opportunity to laud the SDF\u2019s prowess. So President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of a hasty and ill-planned withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria to allow for a Turkish onslaught, left everyone\u2014allies, lawmakers, defense officials, but most significantly the Kurdish-led forces themselves\u2014stunned. Fearing for their existence in the face of an invasion from NATO-allied Turkey, which considers them an enemy, the SDF have rushed to strike a deal with the Iran- and Russia-backed Bashar al-Assad regime. While the details of this arrangement remain in flux, one possibility is for SDF forces to be folded into the Syrian state, following negotiations to which they suddenly bring very little leverage. As a result, the same Kurdish counterterrorism units who have worked with U.S. special operations forces and intelligence may suddenly find themselves working for\u2014or at the mercy of\u2014the Syrian government\u2019s side. This raises a vexing counterintelligence question for America: might these units be forced to spill their secrets to some of America\u2019s foremost global adversaries in Assad, Russia and Iran?\n\nEric L. Robinson, a former U.S. intelligence official who worked on anti-ISIS strategy at the National Counterterrorism Center, called the fact that the SDF had been forced to seek Assad\u2019s protection in Syria a counter-intelligence \u201cnightmare.\u201d He worried, in a Twitter post this week, that \u201cgiven years of SDF exposure\u201d to U.S. special operations forces and intelligence, they would \u201cbe forced to give up TTPs [tactics, techniques and procedures], names, locations, etc. What a coup for the Russian intelligence services\u2014five years of history regarding the elite forces of NATO.\u201d\n\nRobinson, who was a senior civilian in the United States Special Operations Command until last year, also noted that the same elite troops who served in Syria also work around the world on America\u2019s most sensitive national security missions. They\u2019re \u201cfrom the same community that relieves an embassy under siege, identifies [North Korean] mobile missile capacity, rescues hostages, or defends Tallinn from [a] Russian invasion,\u201d he wrote.", "description": "The chaotic withdrawal from Syria will severely weaken U.S. efforts in the country\u2014and could also be a coup for Russia and Iran.", "authors": ["Mike Giglio"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/GettyImages_52349824/facebook.jpg?1571337813", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
