Now Facebook Could End It.", "language": "en", "text": "NEW DELHI \u2014 A year ago hundreds of Indian women took to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to share accounts of sexual harassment they had experienced at the hands of powerful men.\n\nMany of these testimonies were shared by anonymous social media handles to protect the survivors of assault from reprisals by their alleged abusers.\n\nNow the Delhi High Court has ordered Facebook to unmask one such anonymous account. Subodh Gupta, an influential Indian artist whose works are often auctioned for millions of dollars, is suing the as-yet-unknown users of an Instagram handle called HerdSceneAnd for civil defamation and 50 million rupees (approximately $700,000) in damages.\n\nThe HerdSceneAnd handle popped up on Instagram last year as a platform for women to share experiences of abuse and harassment in India\u2019s art world. Anonymous testimonies on the handle accused Gupta of a range of misconduct ranging from inappropriate sexual comments to unwanted, persistent advances and inappropriate touching. Gupta has denied the allegations.\n\nOn Sept. 20, 2019, Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw ordered Facebook to provide \u201cthe particulars of the person behind the Instagram account\u201d in a sealed envelope in time for the next hearing on Nov. 18 this year.\n\nFacebook, which owns Instagram, has declined to comment on what it will do next. But the social media giant\u2019s decisions in India next month could have wide-ranging effects on the privacy and anonymity of the over 2.4 billion users of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram across the world.\n\nAny user information that Facebook puts before Indian courts is likely to fuel a raging debate on the magnitude and granularity of data that big tech companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon routinely gather about us all, and how this data is deployed.\n\nIn the recent past, social media giants have been only too happy to portray themselves as guardians of free speech and expression in the face of repressive regimes. As recently as July 2019, Twitter referenced #MeTooIndia in a glitzy consumer campaign intended to showcase the power of the platform.\n\nUnmasking the collective behind the HerdSceneAnd Instagram account is likely to undermine claims that these platforms serve a higher social purpose.\n\n\u201cAnonymity is the real way whistleblowers, political dissidents, people who have experienced systemic harassment and abuse make their voice heard in societies which do not share their values,\u201d Apar Gupta, a lawyer with the Internet Freedom Foundation, an Indian digital rights advocacy group, told HuffPost India, adding that such harm often happens precisely because the \u201cvictim is someone who lacks power in a particular setting.\u201d\n\nThus far, the Delhi High Court has only asked for information about HerdSceneAnd\u2019s operators. Should Facebook comply, the lawyer said, the company might find itself receiving more detailed requests for information. This may include all correspondence through the account, which could expose the identities of women who shared their testimonies of harassment with HerdSceneAnd.\n\nAnonymity, supporters of India\u2019s Me Too movement have said, is essential to protect survivors of sexual harassment and assault.\n\n\u201cThis defamation suit against @herdsceneand is an outright move to silence the survivors and gag the platform that gave them a voice while protecting their identities,\u201d said a statement of solidarity, circulated over email and signed by at least 38 women journalists and artists. \u201cThis is exactly what survivors have feared when choosing anonymity. This is an attempt to dissuade others from sharing further experiences of harassment and violence, and to perpetuate a culture of fear.\u201d\n\nHerdSceneAnd The account's last post on Aug. 30 reiterated the collective's support for all survivors.\n\nFacebook declined to respond to HuffPost India\u2019s questions.\n\n\u201cWe will not be able to comment as the matter is sub judice. Facebook remains committed to complying with applicable laws,\u201d a Facebook representative said in an email.\n\nNeoma Vasdev, a lawyer for Subodh Gupta, the artist in question, also declined HuffPost India\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nSilencing Free Speech Online\n\nTechnology companies have a stated policy of assisting law enforcement agencies with investigations, (see, for example, Instagram\u2019s privacy policy), but privacy experts and rights activists are watching this case closely to see just how far Facebook will go to reveal the people behind HerdSceneAnd.\n\nThe Instagram handle, according to court documents, is linked to an anonymous email ID \u2014 herdscene@gmail.com \u2014 meaning Facebook could simply pass the buck on to Google, which could be the next in line to receive a court order.\n\nOr, Facebook could start diving into the voluminous archives of user data it collects across WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram to zero in on a list of likely users. It is common practice for Facebook and Google to assign unique advertiser IDs to users (here is how to reset yours), but insist that the data is anonymized and can\u2019t be used to identify individual users. Privacy experts have disputed these claims.\n\nInterestingly, Instagram\u2019s public position in the United States says the platform may share Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of users if the company is served \u201ca valid subpoena issued in connection with an official criminal investigation.\u201d\n\nIP addresses, privacy experts say, are often gateways to a wealth of user information. In 2013, the Indian government ordered all Internet Service Providers to maintain detailed logs of IP activity of Indian internet users for a minimum of one year. These logs must include a user\u2019s name, address and contact number \u2014 data that Internet users must provide to service providers when signing up for a connection.\n\n\u201cPeople tend to have this perception that they are anonymous online, but nothing could be farther from the truth,\u201d said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington D.C. \u201cThe \u2018digital exhaust\u2019 we leave in our wakes as we do things online is prodigious and highly identifying.\u201d\n\nHall said that in the U.S. context there are \u201cJohn Doe\u201d lawsuits that seek to unmask anonymous user accounts, but these lawsuits are usually directed at Internet Service Providers.\n\nThe lawsuit against HerdSceneAnd has parallels to a case involving Diet Madison, an Instagram account that publicized allegations of sexual harassment in the U.S. advertising industry. In the Diet Madison case, which is still underway in a Los Angeles courtroom, the judge has limited the information that can be asked for. In the India case, however, the courts have directly asked Facebook for user information.\n\nWere Facebook to hand over user data, Hall said, \u201cit would mean that Instagram users would need to be very careful making whistleblower-like or even critical comments about people in positions of power, lest the powerful people sue and have an easy way to chill speech on Instagram.\u201d\n\nEncryption Versus Enforcement\n\nIndia\u2019s wholehearted embrace of Facebook\u2019s social media platforms, coupled with the Indian government\u2019s draconian position on free speech and growing obsession with surveillance, has given the country significant leverage in the ongoing debate pitting encryption technologies against law enforcement companies. What happens in India could affect how users around the world experience these services.\n\nThe Indian government has long argued that WhatsApp\u2019s encrypted messaging service is detrimental to national security and has demanded WhatsApp \u201cdigitally fingerprint\u201d all messages in India. Facebook has pushed back thus far, arguing it would undermine user privacy and turn WhatsApp into a different product. Yet with over 400 million WhatsApp users in India, it is unclear how long Facebook will hold out.\n\nAcross the world, pressure on Facebook is growing. On Oct. 4, 2019, U.K. Home Secretary Priti Patel and U.S. Attorney General William Barr signed an open letter to Facebook asking for the company to re-think its stance on encrypting user communications. The letter was released alongside the signing of new agreement, called the Cloud Act, meant to remove obstacles to cross-border surveillance between the U.S. and U.K.\n\nMeanwhile, the Indian Supreme Court is hearing a petition asking that all Indian social media accounts be linked to a national ID. This emerged from the question of WhatsApp traceability, and Facebook has made itself a party to this petition and is arguing against such a requirement. This latest defamation case feeds into the Indian government\u2019s narrative that social media must be regulated for the public good.\n\nYet in this case, this so-called public good is likely to privilege a powerful, wealthy male artist against a small band of women who say he preyed on them.\n\n\u201cI would hope Facebook would push back strongly against efforts to identify people in these cases where there isn\u2019t a valid public interest in disclosure,\u201d Hall from CDT said. \u201cI suspect in this case the person that owns and operates the accounts is merely serving as a conduit, so I doubt identifying the owner of the account will identify the person making the statements.\n\n\u201cThis feels like an effort to intimidate the owner of the account into silence.\u201d", "description": "A defamation case pitting a powerful artist against an Instagram account could strip away a prized protection for survivors of assault \u2014 anonymity.", "authors": ["Editor", "Audience Engagement Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9b3c212100009004ab8e0a.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
