Now enshrined in EU law, the right enables citizens and residents of the bloc to demand that a search engine or website delete or unlink personal information they deem obsolete or excessively intrusive, even if true, and even in the absence of a finding of prejudice. Google and other search engines must delink offending webpages from a search of an individual\u2019s name, even if the underlying article or webpage is lawful and remains online. It, in effect, provides a right of curation\u2014enabling individuals to manage their own reputation online, and to avoid having an embarrassing news article, or an arrest on a charge that was later dropped, follow them around throughout their life.\n\nThis right has been actively employed. In the five years since the European Court first announced the right, Google has received more than 846,000 requests to delist a total of 3.3 million URLs. Google has granted the requests approximately 55 percent of the time. (Notably, some 20 percent of the demands came from 1 percent of the requesters. According to Google, many of these repeat requesters are reputation-management services and law firms.)\n\nFrance, which deems the right a fundamental aspect of the right to privacy, has long argued that Google must delink the information globally. No one anywhere, the country argues, should be directed to a webpage that an individual has successfully suppressed via the right to be forgotten. In France\u2019s view, this is the only way to adequately protect individuals\u2019 rights.\n\nGoogle, by contrast, argues that the right to be forgotten butts heads with other fundamental rights, including the speech-related right to access information that is lawful and true. To balance these competing interests, Google delinks the relevant webpages when users search an affected person\u2019s name from within Europe. But the links are still visible to those who search the same name from outside the EU. Using geo-blocking, Google asserts that it can make the geographic distinctions with approximately 99 percent accuracy.\n\nRuling in Google\u2019s favor, the European Court concluded that EU law does not require delinking to be global. But the court left open the possibility that the EU could demand global delinkings in the future\u2014so long as the law is rewritten to explicitly allow it to do so. And irrespective of EU law, individual nations can still demand worldwide delinking if their laws and their court systems permit it. In other words, global delinking and takedown orders are hardly off the table.\n\nNotably, the court\u2019s analysis basically dictates the result in another highly watched case\u2014pending before the European high court\u2014with even more significant implications for free speech, in which an Austrian court has demanded the worldwide removal of Facebook posts calling a former Austrian Green Party leader a \u201clousy traitor,\u201d a \u201ccorrupt oaf,\u201d and a member of a \u201cfascist party.\u201d According to the Austrian Supreme Court of Justice, this constitutes impermissible defamation and needs to be taken down.", "description": "A landmark ruling in a \u2018\u2018right to be forgotten\u201d case discourages censorship on a global scale.
