When Flynn was a few weeks old, she took him to a cranial osteopath. Pictured: Kerry with her children\n\nIn babies, it is said to be effective for treating irritability caused by colic, feeding difficulties or disturbed sleep. In adults, it may ease head and neck pain, insomnia, stress, headaches or digestive problems.\n\nFlynn seemed to respond instantly.\n\n\u2018As I walked into the clinic he was screaming his head off,\u2019 says Kerry. \u2018The practitioner asked some questions then laid Flynn on his arm, bounced him up and down and started wiggling his fingers over his head. Flynn was soon asleep and he stayed like that for the full 20 minutes.\n\n\u2018Afterwards he was so much calmer and slept better. We were so impressed, we gave him another six sessions and his sleeping improved dramatically.\u2019\n\nPippa Middleton, 36, sister to the Duchess of Cambridge, recently admitted she tried the technique with her baby.\n\n\u2018Soon after Arthur was born last year, I heard a few mums talking about seeing a cranial osteopath,\u2019 she wrote in Waitrose Weekend magazine last week.\n\nShe decided to try it on Arthur and the treatment seemed to work. \u2018I was fascinated to see how calming it was for Arthur,\u2019 enthused Pippa, who said she took her son when he was seven months old.\n\n\u2018The osteopath noticed one side of his neck was tighter than the other, which explained why he favoured one side sleeping. She also saw that his arms were stronger than his legs, so she gave me an exercise to help him.\u2019\n\nPippa Middleton, 36, sister to the Duchess of Cambridge, recently admitted she tried the technique with her baby\n\nTo a tired new mum, anything that helps calm a crying baby appeals. But is cranial osteopathy as good as its fans claim?\n\nPractitioners say many health problems are caused by compression or distortion of the cranial bones which make up the skull \u2014 this can be caused when a baby passes through the birth canal. The theory is that this causes changes to the so-called cranial rhythm, the pulse of fluids and tissues in the brain, which in turn can affect other parts of the body.\n\nCranial osteopaths claim to be able to feel this pulse in the fluid around the brain and spinal cord and use it to diagnose tensions and dysfunctions in the body.\n\n\u2018The treatment uses gentle, non-invasive techniques to manipulate the head and spine, which affects the whole body,\u2019 says Kam Panesar, an osteopath from London Osteopathic Care.\n\nDr Anthony Ordman, a consultant pain specialist at London\u2019s Wellington and Royal Free Hospitals, says \u2018the scientific basis for cranial osteopathy is far from clear\u2019. However, he agrees some people seem to benefit from it.\n\nKerry said: \u2018Afterwards he was so much calmer and slept better. We were so impressed, we gave him another six sessions and his sleeping improved dramatically\u2019 (Kerry pictured with Flynn and Lyla, two)\n\n\u2018I suspect it is the effect of a caring human touch that brings much of the benefit, both for the baby and parents alike,\u2019 he says. It may also help parents to feel they are taking back some control when they had felt helpless.\n\n\u2018As the parents become less stressed, the baby will sense this and become more relaxed too,\u2019 says Dr Ordman.\n\nLinda Walsh, of the Association of Paediatric Chartered Physiotherapists (APCP), says the association can\u2019t recommend cranial osteopathy because of insufficient evidence that it works.\n\n\u2018The physiotherapy profession requires evidence-based proof of safety, efficacy and quality assurance,\u2019 she says.\n\nJewellery designer Kerry, 29, lives in Maidstone, Kent, with accountant husband David, 30. Pictured: Kerry, Flynn and Lyla\n\nKam Panesar is adamant that all osteopathy is a safe, effective form of treatment, though. \u2018Since April 2017, osteopaths have been one of the 12 types of healthcare professional within the remit of the chief allied health professionals officer at NHS England,\u2019 she says. \u2018We have our own regulatory body.\u2019\n\nStuart Korth, director and co-founder of the Osteopathic Centre for Children, a London-based charity, says it is essential that osteopaths have the skills and experience to diagnose problems and \u2018know when not to treat\u2019.\n\n\u2018Not all babies will be suitable,\u2019 says Stuart, who has been treating babies for 45 years and says the interest in infant cranial osteopathy has grown \u2018exponentially\u2019 over that time. \u2018The baby could be distressed for a wide variety of reasons and it may be appropriate to refer to a GP or a specialist.\u2019\n\nCranial osteopathy is not appropriate for conditions such as synostosis (fused skull, which may cause a baby to have a cone-shaped head) or raised pressure inside the head.\n\nHowever, Kerry was so impressed by the effect it had on Flynn that when her daughter Lyla was born two years ago, she resorted to it again, this time to help with her baby\u2019s crying and reflux.\n\n\u2018After a couple of sessions, she started sleeping through and the sickness stopped,\u2019 says Kerry.\n\nBut cranial osteopathy doesn\u2019t work for everyone. Annabelle Devitt, 31, who works in publishing, tried it for her son Tadhg, five months after he was born in a traumatic ventouse delivery that left him with a sore band around his head.\n\nHe was crying a lot,\u2019 says Annabelle, who lives in Gloucestershire with husband Oisin, 33, a gym manager.\n\n\u2018It was one of the midwives at the hospital who suggested cranial osteopathy to me as a way of relieving any pain he might have. He was quite a fretful baby, not great at sleeping and he\u2019d had jaundice and a tongue tie. As a new mum, you can\u2019t bear to think of your little one in any pain so you\u2019ll try whatever.\n\n\u2018It cost \u00a360 for an hour. The practitioner asked me all about the delivery and his sleeping patterns. I was expecting the treatment to be very hands-on but she barely touched him. In fact, I was able to breastfeed him while he had the treatment, so he was nice and relaxed.\n\n\u2018The osteopath only spent about 20 minutes treating him. When she\u2019d finished, she said she couldn\u2019t detect any problems with his head, just a little stiffness in his neck.\n\n\u2018Tadhg slept for over an hour and I was told I could book a follow-up appointment if I felt the first session had been beneficial.\n\n\u2018Sadly, it made no difference to him. His sleeping is no better and he is still quite fretful.\u2019\n\nSessions can cost from \u00a330 a time and on Mumsnet, plenty of parents testify to having spent hundreds of pounds on sessions that didn\u2019t alleviate the crying.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just a good way of extracting cash from desperate people,\u2019 wrote Yahtri in a 2016 message. \u2018Does cranial osteopathy work? \u2018The short answer is, \u201cNo!\u201d.\u2019\n\nPippa Middleton and others will beg to differ.\n\nAdditional reporting: JILL FOSTER\n\nSTORING UP TROUBLE\n\nThe way you handle food can have effects for health. This week: Spinach\n\nSpinach loves supermarket lights. In fact, levels of vitamin C, folate, vitamin E, lutein and zeaxanthin all increased after spinach had spent a few days in storage under continuous light, according to a study by the Agricultural Research Service in the U.S. in 2010. For the same reason, don\u2019t throw away the external leaves on vegetables such as cabbage or iceberg lettuce. These are exposed to the most light, so they can contain up to five times more carotenes \u2014 antioxidants that help protect the body against disease \u2014 than leaves in the middle.\n\nLevels of vitamin C, folate, vitamin E, lutein and zeaxanthin all increased after spinach had spent a few days in storage under continuous light (stock image)\n\nMeanwhile, keep cauliflower, cabbage and broccoli in a vegetable rack. These cruciferous vegetables contain important cancer-fighting compounds called glucosinolates \u2014 and a 2013 study from Rice University in Texas found that exposing them to light, even after they\u2019ve been harvested, increases levels of these. The theory is that glucosinolates are part of the plants\u2019 defence against insects or heat, with light acting as a signal to release them.", "description": "Kerry Clayton's son\u00a0Flynn was born with a stiff neck and often appeared to be in pain.
