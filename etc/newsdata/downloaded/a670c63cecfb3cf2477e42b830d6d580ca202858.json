Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), center, has called for the Department of Transportation's internal watchdog to look into Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao's alleged bias toward Kentucky.\n\nDays after HuffPost reported criticism of his oversight record, Rep. Peter DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat who runs the House panel with jurisdiction over the Department of Transportation, called for an internal investigation of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao\u2019s alleged favoritism toward the state of Kentucky.\n\nMeeting with Kentucky officials constituted 25% of Chao\u2019s meetings with local officials from all 50 states in her first 14 months on the job, Politico reported last week. Chao is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, raising the prospect that she uses her perch as a Cabinet secretary in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to benefit her husband\u2019s state.\n\nDeFazio, who chairs the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, wrote a letter to the Department of Transportation\u2019s inspector general demanding an inquiry into her conduct.\n\n\u201cI would expect Secretary Chao to meet with individuals from her home state more regularly than other states, but the sheer volume \u2026 is troubling,\u201d Defazio told Politico on Tuesday.\n\nDeFazio also noted that the Twitter account for McConnell\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign publicized the initial Politico story on alleged Kentucky favoritism, pointing to it as an explicit benefit of his Senate berth.\n\nMitch McConnell is a Kentucky Asset. https://t.co/TXLzmxoSoW \u2014 Team Mitch (@Team_Mitch) October 7, 2019\n\nDeFazio, first elected in 1986 in a district that now leans just barely Democratic, is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He is a co-sponsor of House Democrats\u2019 single-payer health care legislation and has been especially outspoken in favor of liberal priorities like a financial transactions tax.\n\nBut HuffPost reported on Friday that Doyle Canning, a community organizer who has launched a primary challenge to DeFazio from the left, has made DeFazio\u2019s allegedly light oversight of the Trump administration a central part of her case against the veteran congressman.\n\nCanning declined to take credit for DeFazio\u2019s decision to press for an inspector general\u2019s probe into Chao, pointing instead to the pressure of district-based progressive activists with whom she is aligned. \u201cThe movement is getting stronger by the day,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also was less than impressed with DeFazio\u2019s letter, calling it \u201can example of not using the full powers vested in the United States Congress by the constitution to perform oversight.\u201d\n\nThose who agree with Canning\u2019s critique of DeFazio\u2019s record as a committee head \u2015 including Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Washington-based, anti-corruption Revolving Door Project \u2015 cite the slow pace of the panel\u2019s investigation into Boeing for the sale of faulty jets that led to the crashes of two commercial airliners. The critics fault the committee for not relying on subpoenas to gather information.\n\nBut DeFazio\u2019s committee staff insists that relying on voluntary document disclosure from Boeing and the Federal Aviation Authority, which Chao oversees, rather than using subpoenas has actually allowed the panel to collect documents more rapidly.\n\nHauser has also called for the committee to compel Chao herself to testify about the federal government\u2019s role in the Boeing disaster, her alleged favoritism toward Kentucky and her apparent use of public appearances to promote her father\u2019s shipping company.\n\nHauser told HuffPost on Tuesday that DeFazio\u2019s letter should be the start of even more aggressive measures against Chao.\n\n\u201cHopefully this letter is followed up quickly by subpoenas and a full-fledged aggressive approach to oversight, including making clear the committee\u2019s interest in hearing from whistleblowers and willingness to protect them,\u201d he said. \u201cIn terms of substance and politics, there is nothing to be lost and much to be gained by investigating Chao\u2019s department vigorously.\u201d", "description": "Rep.
