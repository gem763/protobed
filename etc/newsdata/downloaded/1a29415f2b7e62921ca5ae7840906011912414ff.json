A Reuters poll of economists had forecast a +0.1% rise.\n\nGalley said that the bank expected property prices in Britain and Northern Ireland to remain sluggish as long as \"the current period of economic uncertainty persists.\"\n\nThe Halifax figures painted a bleaker picture than a rival survey from Nationwide last week which suggested house price growth was only at an eight-month low.\n\nThe wider U.K. economy is at risk of slipping into a technical recession where gross domestic product (GDP) contracts for two consecutive quarters. Manufacturing and services data is suggesting that U.K. economy did shrink in the three months to September, following a confirmed 0.2% contraction in the April-to-June period.\n\nThe Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is a measure of economic health for the manufacturing and service sectors. September's composite PMI sank to 48.8 where anything below 50 marks a contraction.", "description": "On a month-to-month basis, house prices fell by 0.4% in September to reach an average value across the U.K. of $286,209.", "authors": ["David Reid"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104001186-GettyImages-525528728.jpg?v=1532564015", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
