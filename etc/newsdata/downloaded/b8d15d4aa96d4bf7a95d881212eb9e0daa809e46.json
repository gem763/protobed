In the clip, the singer reveals she has a jar of Dr. Barbara Sturm's MC1 Blood Moisturizer. The $1,400 cream is made with her own blood\n\n'When I designed this bathroom, it was really important for me to have a double-sided mirror,' she says at the start of the clip, explaining that one side is for washing her face while the other is for doing her makeup.\n\nAfter showing off the mirror, Nicole moves on to her collection of products from Dr. Barbara Sturm, whom she notes is a 'dear friend' of hers.\n\nThe Pussycat Dolls star has the brand's $70 cleanser, $75 enzyme cleanser, and $75 toner, but those are bargains compared to the company's $1,400 MC1 Blood Moisturizer that is made with her own blood.\n\n'This is my moisturizer, which they actually took my blood and created. It's not bloody or anything,' she says as she opens the jar, insisting it keeps you looking 'youthful.'\n\nNicole is not the only celebrity to have tried out the face cream; Kim Kardashian and Hailey Bieber are both included on the long list of its A-list fans, with both women speaking out to praise the product in the past.\n\nThe cream's formula is based around Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP), which is extracted from a person's blood before being added to the product, meaning that every single jar of the moisturizer is tailored specifically to the user.\n\nBig fan: In addition to the jar of blood moisturizer, Nicle has the brand's $70 cleanser, $75 enzyme cleanser, and $75 toner (left to right)\n\nAdded touch: Nicole keeps a bottle of Santa Maria Novella body milk ($96) near her sink because she loves 'all things Italian'\n\nPRP - which is also the key to the once-viral Vampire Facials - is meant to stimulate healing in the skin, meaning that the complexion is able to regenerate more effectively, thereby maintaining a youthful appearance.\n\nIt has also been credited with helping to treat a number of skin conditions, including psoriasis, which Kim suffers from.\n\nBut while it might be the most expensive product in her bathroom, the Dr. Barbara Sturm cream is not the only pricey highlight.\n\nAt the sink, Nicole has bottles of Byredo La Tulipe body lotion ($65) and Santa Maria Novella body milk ($96) because she loves 'all things Italian.'\n\n'I like to keep very calming things in my bathroom. I have this crystal for good energy and fresh flowers \u2060\u2014 always,' she says.\n\nOn a shelf sits a framed photo of Nicole on a beach in Hawaii, her home state. She recalls feeling like she was reaching for the sky when the snapshot was taken.\n\nNicole then moves to the other side of the mirror, explaining: 'I designed this area because every woman just desires a vanity, a place to get ready.'\n\nNext stop: Nicole does her makeup on the other side of her double-sided mirror\n\nGoing all out: The Masked Singer judge has a collection of Charlotte Tilbury lipsticks that retail for $37 apiece (left) and a $370 set of Artis Elite oval makeup brushes (right)\n\nShe admits she has so many makeup brushes that she actually has to use a label maker to keep track of what each one is used for.\n\nIn addition to those, she has a set of 10 Artis Elite oval makeup brushes, which costs $370.\n\nNicole likes to keep part of her lipstick collection on display, with her seven $18.50 MAC lipsticks stored in a holder from her grandmother.\n\nIn another area, she has Charlotte Tilbury Hot Lips lipsticks, which are all inspired by different women in the makeup artist's life, including JK Rowling, Jennifer Aniston, and Amal Clooney, and retail for $37 apiece.\n\nAs well as those, Nicole also has a selection of lipsticks from Tom Ford, Dior, and Chanel.\n\nLike most skincare-loving celebrities, she has a vibrating gold facial massager that she calls her 'little magic skincare wand.'\n\nWhile Jillian Dempsey's ever-popular Gold Sculpting Bar sells for $195, and has been used by everyone from Kirsten Dunst to Jennifer Aniston, Nicole's appears to be a different brand, possibly Terre Mere's Gold Youth Wand, which retails for $128.\n\nWhen she is traveling, she uses Bliss's Triple Oxygen Instant Energizing Eye Mask ($35), and in the evening, she applies Liz Earle's Superskin Concentrate for Night ($54) to her skin and temples.\n\nTaking care: Nicole has a vibrating gold facial massager that she calls her 'little magic skincare wand,' though it's unclear which brand she uses\n\nTherapeutic: In the evening, she applies Liz Earle's Superskin Concentrate for Night ($54) to her skin and temples (pictured in her hand)\n\nHigh and low: A bedazzled jar of Vaseline sits next to her $1,095 jar of 111SKIN Celestial Black Diamond Cream\n\nHer vanity also houses Caudalie's Beauty Elixir and Jurlique hand cream, which sell for $49 and $20, respectively.\n\nNicole clearly has a thing for pricey moisturizers because she also has a jar of 111SKIN Celestial Black Diamond Cream that costs a whopping $1,095.\n\nHowever, according to Dermstore, for that hefty sum, you get a slew of benefits, with the online beauty store promising that the 'luxurious face cream' will 'penetrate deeply into the skin, revealing a supple and smooth complexion'.\n\n'[The cream] works to improve cell function, collagen synthesis and antioxidant production,' the Dermstore description continues. 'Skin is left more resilient, smoother and softer [and] dull complexions are brightened.'\n\nBut while Nicole does indeed have a taste for the finer things in life, that doesn't mean everything at her vanity is super expensive.\n\nThe songwriter keeps a dry bar of soap that she applies to her eyebrows with a spoolie to keep them in place; meanwhile her Kopari coconut deodorant only costs $14, and she also likes to have a jar of coconut oil on hand.\n\n'I actually grew up with my family taking the coconuts from their yard, extracting the oil, and sending it to me here on the mainland,' she recalls. 'But, yeah, now coconut is everywhere and it's awesome.'\n\nFavorites: Bliss's Triple Oxygen Instant Energizing Eye Mask ($46), Caudalie's Beauty Elixir ($49), and Jurlique hand cream ($20) all sit on top of her vanity\n\nKeeping it real: Nicole also has an inexpressive jar of coconut oil. Before it became a grocery store stable, her family used to send her from Hawaii before it was popular\n\nSentimental: Nicole keeps her MAC lipsticks stored in a holder from her grandmother\n\nThe most inexpensive thing on her vanity is her jar of Vaseline, but unlike most people's tubs of petroleum jelly, hers is bedazzled.\n\nSwarovski crystal-encrusted jars of Vaseline cost about $30 on Etsy, and while it's not an unaffordable luxury, it's certainly extra in every way.\n\nNicole, who has her own perfume collection, makes it clear that fragrance is an important part of her life, so it should come as no surprise that she has an extensive collection of scents.\n\n'Scent is so important to me,' the singer explains. 'It's so therapeutic. I actually don't leave the house without putting perfume on, and I don't go on stage without putting perfume on. For me, it just seals the deal. I feel complete, and it helps me set the mood.'\n\nIn addition to her own fragrance line, she has bottles of Christian Dior Sakura, Holey Peony, and Ambre Nuit, which cost $220 each.\n\nFragrance fan: Nicole, who has her own perfume line, has an extensive collection of scents, including three Christian Dior perfumes that cost $220 apiece\n\nLuxe: Nicole has a steam shower with floor to ceiling marble and a marble bench where she likes to meditate\n\nShe also likes Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle Outrageous ($170), Chanel N\u00b05 Eau de Parfum ($105), and Byredo La Tulipe ($175), with the singer explaining that she is a 'very floral girl' when it comes to fragrance.\n\nAfter showing off her perfume collection, Nicole moves on to her showstopping shower, a luxury that most people can only dream of.\n\n'As a singer, it was really important for me to have a steam shower. 'It's just a great way to warm up your voice, and just sweat it out,' she explains.\n\n'When I was designing this shower, I wanted the entire thing to be marble, so it's all marble from the ceiling to the floor.'\n\nHer shower bench is made of Calcutta marble, and she says she likes to sit there and meditate. She even has an Aqua Notes waterproof notepad to jot down ideas that come to her.\n\nOpulent: Nicole's bathroom is complete with a giant bathtub that is so deep she can't resist cracking a joke about swimming laps in i\n\nDelightful: She has a counter filled with bath products, including a $91 jar of Queen of Roses Bath Milk by Lola's Apothecary and a $30 container of Jane Inc.'s Apothecary Coconut Bath\n\nWow factor: 'My absolute favorite thing about this bathroom is the view, she says as she lifts the blinds and reveals her patio overlooking Los Angeles\n\nNicole accentuates the spa-like atmosphere with European Spa Source's lemongrass and eucalyptus shower mist ($39.50), a pumice stone made from organic lava, a dry brush, and a charcoal exfoliating cloth.\n\nShe has a $75 cleanser from SK-II on the shelf to wash her face, while her $45 body cleanser and $37 body scrub are both from Aesop.\n\nThe Masked Singer judge washes her long dark locks with Shu Uemura shampoo and conditioner, which cost $48 and $58, respectively.\n\nNicole's bathroom is complete with a giant bathtub that is so deep she can't resist cracking a joke about swimming laps in it.\n\nNext to the tub sits a counter filled with bath products, including a $91 jar of Queen of Roses Bath Milk by Lola's Apothecary and a $30 container of Jane Inc.'s Apothecary Coconut Bath. To top it off, she has a $48 bottle of Neom's bath and shower oil.\n\nStunned: Viewers couldn't resist commenting on Nicole's outrageously expensive beauty products, with some assuming the lavish skincare items were give to her to promote\n\n'My absolute favorite thing about this bathroom is the view, she says as she lifts the blinds and reveals her patio overlooking Los Angeles. 'I love feeling so high up. My friends tell me the higher I am up here in the hills, the closer I am to heaven.'\n\nThe video has been viewed more than 93,000 times, and people can't get over the price of some of her beauty products.\n\n'That diamond cream costs $1,095 y\u2019all,' one person wrote, while someone else griped: 'I can't even afford the bedazzled Vaseline.'\n\n'Nicole's bathroom called me poor in 73 different languages,' another commented.\n\nOthers assumed that the lavish products were given to her to promote.\n\n'The sponsorship of it all,' one person wrote, while another said: 'Stop with the Sturm promotion.'", "description": "Nicole, 41, shows off her pricey beauty products while giving a tour of her personal bathroom in her Los Angeles home in a new video.", "authors": ["Erica Tempesta", "Charlie Lankston For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/02/19519916-0-image-a-105_1570669832520.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
