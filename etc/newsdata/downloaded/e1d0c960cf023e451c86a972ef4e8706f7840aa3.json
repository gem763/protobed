It is a part of our lives, isn\u2019t it? And we simply cannot get over the show, at least not in this lifetime. When Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler and Ross laughed, we all laughed with them all too. When they cried, we cried too. And we grew up with them too.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nIt has been long that we have been waiting for a reunion of FRIENDS cast, right? But our favourite actors only give us mini-reunion. If you follow them, you would know that Courteney Cox & Lisa Kudrow AKA Monica and Phoebe often hang out with each other.\n\nBut this time, in this mini-FRIENDS reunion, which was hosted by Courtney Cox, there was Jennifer Aniston and Matt LeBlanc. They posed for a selfie too \u2013 the one where they all smiled for the camera. Take a look!\n\nCourtney Cox aka Monica often hangs out with Jennifer Aniston (Rachel) and Lisa Kudrow (Phoebe) but to see Matt LeBlanc (Joey) with them all is rare. Hence, Cox captioned the picture as \u201cA rare night and I love it.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss 126 SHARES 6.3 K SHARES 3.5 K SHARES 1.8 K SHARES 1.4 K SHARES\n\nBy the way, do you know that new generation of FRIENDS fans confuse Matt LeBlanc for Joey\u2019s dad and he just shoos them away.\n\nAlso, it is official that watching FRIENDS helps you reduce anxiety and soothes pain, says psychologist. \u201cHaving worked for over a period of 20 years with those experiencing anxiety, I can conclude that among other factors, it is the repetitive and relational nature of programs such as Friends and Big Bang Theory that will be doing the trick,\u201d linical psychologist Marc Hekster was earlier quoted as saying by the Metro.\n\nSo, you all can jump with joy!", "description": "But this time, in this mini-FRIENDS reunion, which was hosted by Courtney Cox, there was Jennifer Aniston and Matt LeBlanc.
