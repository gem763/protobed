Tesco obviously has a head of plant-based innovation who's in charge of pursuing the vegan pound, and perusing products that will flog to people who don't eat meat.\n\n'I just think this advert is astonishing because if you came in the kitchen and said \"I don't fancy mince\", the fist thing that would happen is you would get a whack.\n\n'Then, you'd sit at the table and my mum or dad would say \"if you don't want mince you're not having it\".'\n\nCo-host Ruth Langsford weighed in, saying: 'I'm mixed with this one. I understand UK farmers saying it's demonising meat, but I can understand being pressurised by your kids.'\n\nShe feels that children should not be able to dictate the meals their parents eat and feels the advert 'demonizes' meat\n\nCo-host Ruth Langsford (pictured) was torn on the issue, and felt that if her child decided to become a vegetarian she wouldn't stop eating meat but would cook separate meals\n\nJanet simply replied: 'Nauseating .'\n\nViewers were quick to take to Twitter with their views, with one agreeing: 'That was my childhood. No meat- \"have a slice of cheese\" was my mum\u2019s answer.'\n\nAnother said: 'I fully agree with Jane.t I said the same when I watched it. You don\u2019t dictate what you eat to your parents or I wouldn\u2019t have anyway coz my mum would have said eat what you're given or starve lol.'\n\nA fourth added: 'Vegan sausages and bacon! vegans shouldn't be allowed anything that looks tastes remotely like meat. They made their choice. They should live with it.'\n\nHowever many disagreed with Janet, and argued that there's no problem with promoting plant-based food, and that parents shouldn't 'force' their children to eat meat.\n\nViewers were quick to take to Twitter, with many agreeing with Janet and arguing that they wouldn't have been allowed to quit meat when they were a child\n\nThe panel were conflicted over the issue with some hosts saying they would cook their child separate meals if they decided they did not want to eat meat\n\nOne wrote: 'Why is it so bad to promote plant based food when we are bombarded with meat ads constantly? We don\u2019t get a choice when it come to meat being pushed in our faces.'\n\nAnother said: 'So, Janet is talking about her youth, which was a very long time ago. It\u2019s 2019 and vegans are doing their thing.\n\n'If we don\u2019t want to eat meat then we don\u2019t have to especially a child! You can\u2019t force something on someone they have there own voice and mind it\u2019s up to them.'\n\nMany viewers disagreed with Janet, and argued that there's no problem with promoting plant-based food and parents shouldn't 'force' their children to eat meat\n\nA third added: 'People have a right to choose what they eat, I think the advert is good showing a parent supporting their child. Why make such a big deal about it.\n\nIn a statement given to Loose Women, the head of plant-based innovation at Tesco said: 'The whole team just wanted a food love story focusing on plant based food.\n\n'We encouraged them to be brave and keep the part in when she says she doesn't want to eat animals.'\n\nJanet argued: 'Of course she can choose not to eat animals. All I want the ad to say is that we did it one or two days a week. It's just the blanket demonisation of meat.'", "description": "Loose Women panellist Janet Street-Porter,71, prompted a mixed reaction online after slamming Tesco's latest vegan advert and branding it 'nauseating' and insisting the premise is 'astonishing'", "authors": ["Monica Greep For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/13/19740282-0-image-a-73_1571143349092.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
