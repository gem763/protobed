It carries a piece of technology often used to observe or manipulate items on the sea floor: a pressure-resistant robotic platform tethered to the ship by a very long cable.\n\n\u201cHumans can\u2019t go beyond a certain depth,\u201d explained Peter Weiss, robotics and automation engineer, Comex.\n\n\u201cIf we want to go below 700 metres then we need a robot. That\u2019s when we use the so called ROVs \u2014 to perform these kind of deep-sea operations.\u201d\n\nIt is extremely rare that divers go deeper than 100 meters deep (which is already very demanding). With particular equipment (atmospheric diving suit) it is possible to go up to 700m deep, but their use is still very experimental, and remains the exception rather than a daily routine.\n\nDeparture to the sea\n\nThis vessel\u2019s ROV has two cameras which, just like human eyes, provide stereoscopic vision, and with advanced \u2018arms\u2019 \u2014 the manipulators have three \u2018fingers\u2019, so more dexterous than typical two-fingered ROVs.\n\n\u201cThere is some room for progress in terms of dexterity when manipulating objects,\u201d explained Jeremi Gancet,\u201d DexROV project coordinator and technologies, applications & research division manager at Space Applications Services.\n\n\u201cWe are also working on controlling this kind of robotic platform via satellite link from a control centre that can be placed anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nUntil then, all ROVs need to be controlled from the ship. Moving the control onto land would be safer and more cost-effective, as smaller vessels could be used.\n\nFor the test, a ship in the Mediterranean Sea is linked via a satellite to the control centre in Belgium.\n\nSome 1,000 km away, the operators work in a virtual reality simulation. Their commands are relayed back to the ROV. There is a communication delay. So the ROV has to be autonomous enough to operate safely with no real-time control. It also needs intelligence to interpret what\u2019s happening in the virtual world, and to act accordingly in the sea.\n\n\u201dWe have separated what the robot does from what the control centre does,\u201d Javier Mart\u00ednez Gonz\u00e1lez, Researcher in virtual reality, Space Applications Services, told Euronews.\n\n\u201cHere the work will be conducted continuously, in real time. The intelligent software will be observing what we\u2019re doing at the control centre and will be sending this information to the robot which will be carrying out the tasks automatically, by itself, without our continuous guidance.\u201d\n\nTo make robotic arms more dexterous, engineers in this European research project are using an exoskeleton system. It provides the operator with force feedback, allowing to feel the weight and resistance of the objects manipulated in virtual reality.\n\n\u201dWe\u2019ll control this 3D character in virtual reality,\u201d said Pierre Letier, Robotics engineer, Space Applications Services.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll perform a task, and his movements will be taken apart to be reassembled by the remote robot, which allows to operate with long delays.\u201d\n\nThis technology can help to control autonomous vehicles safely and accurately \u2014 not just in depths of the ocean, but also on land, or wherever robotic dexterity could be used.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine this same kind of technology used on a mobile platform on the ground, with manipulator arms,\u201d said Jeremi Gancet.\n\n\u201cThis kind of technology could be useful in dangerous situations such as Fukushima where there\u2019s still the need for operations on the ground.\u201d\n\nThe researchers are testing components of their advanced ROV system, heading to a advanced trial 1,300 meters deep in the Mediterranean Sea.", "description": "How will the new intelligent breed of remote-operated vehicles (ROVs) benefit us?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/377923/1000x563_377923.jpg", "published_at": "2017-08-07"}
