The game needs South Africa to be strong... Time for Mark Boucher to take over... also why wouldn't you use Graeme Smith and Jacques Kallis is some capacity,\" he wrote.\n\nFollowing their innings and 202 run defeat in the final Test on Monday, Test skipper Du Plessis stated that Brexit will \"benefit\" South African cricket as less players will opt for a Kolpak package.\n\n\n\n\"It's sad for South African cricket not to have the option of their best players,\" Du Plessis told reporters in Ranchi.\n\nA cricket fan @The5BallOver, sent Vaughan a message saying that \"they (Englishmen) are the ones stealing all our (South African) players though Kolpak deals\".\n\nVaughan replied that England did not steal any players and blamed the SA system for letting players leave.\n\n\"We don't steal. They come because they get a better chance to have a career... That's what needs to change on SA... They shouldn't be having to leave,\" wrote Vaughan.\n\nThe Proteas' next assignment will be this summer as they welcome England to South African shores in a four-Test series. There will also be theree ODIs and three T20Is played during the tour.\n\nThis South African Test team is a real concern for the game .. The game needs South Africa to be strong .. Time for @markb46 to take over .. also why wouldn\u2019t you use @GraemeSmith49 & @jacqueskallis75 is some capacity .. #INDvsSA \u2014 Michael Vaughan (@MichaelVaughan) October 22, 2019", "description": "Former England captain Michael Vaughan believes that the game of cricket needs to have a strong South African team.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9516/a99a1ed3009f429098c9ca3a0249ae56.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
