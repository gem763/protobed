The walkers are coming from all sides, trying to make their way towards the community. The exhausting fight lasts for nearly 50 hours. In the end, our heroes manage to fight the hordes off for a time being. No one can sleep, because of the fear that the walkers might come back at any time.\n\nFighting 'Ghosts'\n\nEveryone seems to think that the Whisperers have something to do with the walker threat. Then, Gamma approaches and lets the survivors know that Alpha wants a meeting at their northern border, the site where that horrible pike scene happened last season.\n\nOne group led by Daryl, Michonne and Carol, heads out to the border to meet with the leader of the Whisperers. Others stay behind to defend their home, while Aaron and Negan go on the mission to thin out the herd of walkers coming from the south.\n\nThroughout the episode we see Carol experiencing PTSD, but she\u2019s not the only one. Siddiq is struggling too. He\u2019s still haunted by that horrible night when Alpha beheaded a dozen people and left him alive to tell the story. At least Dante, his newly-appointed medical assistant, is there, to put a smile on Siddiq\u2019s face with the story of Adonis-looking cat a.k.a. himself.\n\nRosita tells Eugene, once and for all, that nothing will ever happen between them and that they can only be friends.\n\nEugene is crushed and tells Rosita that he\u2019s never going to be her true friend because he\u2019ll always have hope that friendship will turn into something more.\n\nWe also have Negan and Aaron going on the mission of their own. Dubbed, Peanut Butter and Jelly by Gabriel, the duo heads out to take down at least some of the walkers before they come to Alexandria.\n\nWhile on the road, we see that Aaron is still holding a grudge against Negan.\n\nAfter all, he lost Eric, the love of his life, in the war against the Saviors, so it's only natural that he blames Negan for it. Negan, however, ends up saving Aaron\u2019s life multiple times, which seems to soften Aaron up a bit.\n\nCarol's hallucinations: what's real and what's not\n\nThe good chunk of the episode is devoted to Carol and her own traumas. She nearly ruins negotiations with the Whisperers, when she pulled the gun on Alpha.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t for Michonne, she would have probably gotten the whole group killed.\n\nCarol also experiences quite a bit of hallucination. It\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s real or not. She sees some Whisperers, dreams up a conversation with Darryl when he tells her this weird story of his dad, a truck driver, seeing a ghost on the road.\n\nShe then goes into an abandoned gym, sees walkers everywhere, and ends up hanging from the rope, fighting for her life.\n\nEventually, she cuts the rope, falls into a glass, and cuts herself. Carol definitely needs the longest nap of her life.\n\nHowever, we do see in the closing shots of the episode that there were indeed Whisperers in the area and the one Carol managed to shoot seems to have turned. What this does cement is that the Whisperers are indeed looking upon the group at all times, supervising them and making sure they stay in line.\n\nAll in all, \u201cGhosts\u201d was a solid episode. It was packed with some interesting character moments, great dialogue and quite a bit of action, but most importantly, it set things up for the rest of the season.", "description": "The third episode of 'TWD' Season 10, titled 'Ghosts,' sets some big things up.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Ramon Sanchez", "Susan B.", "Oliver Vandervoort", "Read More On The Same Topic Milos Kitanovic", "'Game Of Thrones' Targaryen Prequel Nears Hbo Pilot Order", "'Game Of Thrones' Prequel Pilot Has Officially Finished Filming", "George R.R.
