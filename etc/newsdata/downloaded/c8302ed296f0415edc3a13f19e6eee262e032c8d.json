We forced them to throw it. And Malcolm made, I believe, one of the greatest plays in the history of the NFL. Look, No. 5 is pretty good considering 100 years of the NFL and all these plays.\n\n\"I told Malcolm that was one of the greatest defensive plays I've ever seen in my life. For him to recognize it. So few players could've made that play because of his quickness, his burst, and then his ability to attack the football. Dont'a [Hightower] made the play before that . . . and then Malcolm made that play. That was pretty crazy. I lost my mind when he made that play. That was an out of body experience.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe defensive play Brady was alluding to was the fact that the Patriots went very heavy with their personnel on that second-and-goal play from the one-yard line. They had seven front-seven players on the line of scrimmage: Rob Ninkovich, Chris Jones, Alan Branch, Silver Siliga, Vince Wilfork, Jamie Collins and Chandler Jones. Hightower was at the linebacker level behind them. And there were three corners on the field, no safeties, to match up with Seattle's three receivers.\n\nRunning into a ton -- close to an actual metric ton -- of humanity on the line of scrimmage, Brady argued, wouldn't have made sense. Clearly Carroll and his staff agreed. So they threw. And we know the result.\n\nBut on second down, with 26 seconds left and a timeout, with Marshawn Lynch in the backfield, hard to believe that throwing was their only option there.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
