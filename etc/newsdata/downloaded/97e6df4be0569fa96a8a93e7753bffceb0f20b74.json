(AP) - The Atlanta Falcons\u2019 offensive line might be able to start the same five players for the second straight week.\n\nAs six-time Pro Bowl center Alex Mack sees it, that\u2019s progress.\n\nAtlanta (1-1) heads to Indianapolis (1-1) this weekend coming off a four-point win over Philadelphia that included more personnel shuffling on the line.\n\nThe Falcons had already lost rookie right guard Chris Lindstrom, the 14th overall draft pick, to a broken foot the week before when rookie right tackle Kaleb McGary, the 31st overall pick, went down with a knee injury in the second quarter. McGary returned in the fourth to replace Ty Sambrailo, but the line was making other adjustments with Jamon Brown filling in for Lindstrom.\n\nThe line adjusted on the fly to help produce the winning drive, but quarterback Matt Ryan threw three interceptions, and the run game took a step back with an average of 3.4 yards on 17 carries. Starter Devonta Freeman has run 19 times for just 41 yards in two games.\n\n\u201cWe had some really good plays and we had some plays where there was meat still on the bone,\u201d Mack said. \u201cGuys here and there not doing exactly what we wanted them to. A 4-yard run, which is good, but it could\u2019ve been an 8- to 10-yard run. Those are things you hope to grow and build from and getting better and better as the year goes on.\u201d\n\nMcGary\u2019s status against the Colts is uncertain. He did not practice Wednesday and was limited Thursday. Sambrailo will start if McGary, who missed much of the preseason with a heart procedure, is held out.\n\nMack, in his 11th year, knows that fluid communication is critical on the line. He has two new guards, nine-year veteran James Carpenter on the left side and Brown, a fifth-year veteran, figures to start on the right side until Lindstrom returns in the second part of the season.\n\nMack is accustomed to left tackle Jake Matthews, his teammate for the past four years, but McGary is still a work in progress. As they walked into the locker room from the practice field Thursday, Mack was still giving instructions.\n\nMcGary is still feeling his way through the pro game, and Mack wanted him to know it\u2019s OK to speak up.\n\n\u201cWhat you see a lot of times with young guys is they\u2019re afraid of screwing up so they won\u2019t talk as much,\u201d Mack said. \u201cYou should let that go, make the calls and if you\u2019re wrong, we\u2019ll help you. If you\u2019re saying anything that\u2019s just outrageous, it\u2019s better to tell us you\u2019re going to do something dumb and we\u2019ll stop you and we\u2019ll get you on the same page.\n\n\u201cI do the same thing. If I make the wrong call or if I\u2019m screwed up, they\u2019ll be like, \u2018No, no, no. You\u2019re going the wrong way. It\u2019s a different play.\u2019 \u201c\n\nMatthews made the O-line\u2019s play of the game against Philadelphia , flattening cornerback Avonte Maddox late in the fourth quarter to help spring Julio Jones free for a 54-yard touchdown catch on fourth-and-3. Ryan said after the game that he had never faced such relentless blitzing in 12 seasons, but Matthews, a sixth-year veteran, loved how his teammate read the pressure and checked down to the decisive screen on the left side.\n\n\u201cWe knew they were going to bring a lot of zero pressure, just everyone,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cObviously sometimes they\u2019re bringing more than you can block so you have to work for ways to get the ball out or whatever it may be. The last play of the game we took advantage of that with that screen when they brought an all-out.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Atlanta Falcons' offensive line might be able to start the same five players for the second straight week.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "George Henry"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/falcons_line_shuffle_football_05594_c0-129-3078-1923_s1770x1032.jpg?2fc52cccb09594911508c860b26a828f74b0e548", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
