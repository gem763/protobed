LifeZette is also the target of a labor complaint aimed at its payroll practices from a former employee who says paychecks came sporadically and with little official documentation, according to documents provided to The Daily Beast.\n\nMost seriously, according to seven sources currently and formerly employed by LifeZette, the organization has become a deeply uncomfortable place for women to work, with a top company official repeatedly making sexually suggestive comments about female employees\u2014sometimes within earshot of those female staffers.\n\nByron Martinez, LifeZette\u2019s former broadcast engineer and IT administrator, recalled Peter Anthony, the site\u2019s chief executive \u201ctalking about other women\u2019s boobs, butts\u2026 how he would desire sexual activities with [female colleagues] and stuff like that\u2026 All kinds of inappropriate talk about women in the office.\u201d\n\nSix other sources also singled out Anthony by name as the chief culprit. Anthony, a longtime friend and business partner of Ingraham\u2019s, co-founded the D.C.-based site with her and oversees its day-to-day operations.\n\nWith the exception of Martinez, all sources spoke to The Daily Beast on the condition of anonymity because they feared reprisal from Ingraham and Anthony.\n\nReports of Anthony\u2019s conduct at Ingraham\u2019s company come as the latter is in talks for her own prime-time show at Fox News, which has itself recently paid millions of dollars to settle allegations that some of its most senior employees and talent sexually harassed female co-workers.\n\nLifeZette sources say Anthony not only frequently made sexually inappropriate comments about female employees, but also aggressively and profanely pressured staffers into taking liquor shots at company happy hours.\n\nOne former employee recalled being called into Anthony\u2019s office under the pretense of an editorial discussion. Instead, the CEO began commenting on a colleague\u2019s breasts.\n\n\u201cIs it just me or are [a female colleague\u2019s] tits getting bigger?\u201d the source recalled him saying. In another instance, according to the same source, Anthony said a female colleague \u201clooks like a bitch. If she smiled more she\u2019d be sexier.\u201d Other current and former LifeZette employees described similar sexually suggestive comments.\n\nMultiple sources described Anthony\u2019s habit of gossiping audibly in the office\u2014including to former senior editor Joseph Curl\u2014about how a twentysomething female colleague must be \u201cdoing yoga because her ass was so good,\u201d among other crude observations targeting specific female reporters.\n\nIn response to an email from The Daily Beast, Curl replied by writing, \u201cSo, Houston is under water, North Korea's firing missiles over Japan, the cost of health care has tripled under Obamacare, and you\u2019re writing about -- LifeZette happy hours? No wonder so many Americans despise the media. Your \u2018story\u2019 is less than fake news\u2014it\u2019s utter bullshit.\u201d\n\n(The Daily Beast did not bring up happy hours with Curl in the prior email exchange, suggesting Curl had been in contact with someone else The Daily Beast had reached for this story. Anthony claims that he wasn\u2019t in contact with Curl regarding the statement above.)\n\nIn any event, management, specifically Anthony, made vanishingly little effort to hide his behavior from colleagues, all of the sources said independently.\n\nMuch of his crude, sexual commentary was done within clear earshot of his female employees, multiple women told The Daily Beast. One source said it seemed like he \u201cjust didn\u2019t care.\u201d Another succinctly described Ingraham and Anthony\u2019s operation as \u201ca kooky work environment\u201d defined largely by \u201cmanagement by chaos,\u201d with all seven sources echoing sentiments of poor management.\n\nA different source who has worked for LifeZette said Anthony sometimes used similarly misogynistic and vulgar terms when discussing former colleagues.\n\n\u201cCall her up and tell her she\u2019s a bitch for leaving us,\u201d Anthony said, according to the source. \u201cI would walk by her desk and she wouldn\u2019t even smile at me.\u201d\n\nDesks in the office were arranged, according to multiple sources, so young female employees were directly outside Anthony\u2019s office.\n\n\u201c[Anthony] is a really gross, skeezy guy that I don\u2019t think anybody at the company had faith in\u2026 a total creep to women in the office,\u201d said a former employee.\n\nMultiple male and female staffers said Anthony would also find the opportunity to make \u201cwomen feel super-uncomfortable\u201d during late-afternoon staff happy hours. He would rowdily demand colleagues take several rounds of liquor shots, according to sources, and sometimes publicly call male or female employees \u201ca pussy\u201d if they did not comply.\n\nSources also said Anthony sometimes made comments about race that they found discomfiting. Two sources said they heard Anthony criticize Michelle Obama for a spring 2016 speech in which she supposedly used \u201cEbonics.\u201d\n\nAnthony, for his part, rejected this and every other allegation presented to him in a Monday phone call.\n\n\u201cThe questions you put to me are false,\u201d Anthony told The Daily Beast. \u201cI stand by LifeZette\u2019s record as a company. Since we\u2019ve been in business we\u2019ve never had a single complaint about misconduct, inappropriate behavior, unsafe work environment, or lack of professionalism by any staff. These are things we take very seriously at every level. We treat our employees both current and former with the utmost respect.\u201d\n\nThat statement is incomplete, however. After Martinez resigned from the company this year, he lodged a complaint with District of Columbia employment regulators alleging that he was not paid in a timely manner, and not provided with pay stubs. According to documentation that Martinez provided to The Daily Beast, LifeZette received that complaint\u2014and denied its allegations\u2014this month.\n\nAnthony reiterated that denial in an emailed statement. \u201cMr. Martinez was paid every two weeks and any issue with Mr. Martinez being unable to receive direct deposit or failure to pick up his paycheck should be directed to Mr. Martinez,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs I have already stated,\u201d he said in another email, \u201cthese unattributed allegations are false.\u201d\n\nBut not all of the allegations are unattributed, as his response to Martinez\u2019s complaint indicates.\n\nMartinez said the company provided no meaningful recourse to address the alleged payment discrepancies. \u201cI communicated this to our quote-unquote HR department, but that just didn\u2019t seem to help because two to three weeks went by and I never got a response,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I went directly to Pete and said \u2018Hey, what\u2019s going on.\u2019 He sent in the payment, but it continued month after month.\u201d\n\nMartinez oversaw the construction of a broadcast studio in the company\u2019s offices. In that capacity, he said, he witnessed contractors go months without receiving their promised compensation. Separately, another former vendor told The Daily Beast that the site had reneged on a five-figure video contract, and that repeated efforts to elicit an explanation or a resolution from LifeZette leadership went unanswered. The contractor, who provided The Daily Beast with emails showing their repeated attempts to collect more than $15,000 in unpaid fees, asked to remain anonymous to avoid damaging other professional relationships.\n\nThree LifeZette sources, including Martinez, say they never felt that internal complaints led to any meaningful resolution for either bookkeeping issues or what they describe as Anthony\u2019s routine denigration of women in the office.\n\nMartinez said he tried with little success to enlist an off-site human-resources staffer to resolve his payroll problems, but that those problems continued.\n\n\u201cThere were times that I was getting paid whenever Pete felt like paying me,\u201d Martinez continued. \u201cThat went on for months... I gave them time, but then I began to see a pattern where I\u2019m not getting paid on time.\u201d\n\nAnthony, in addition to being responsible for the operations of LifeZette, also served as a top public representative for his and Ingraham\u2019s media venture. He has been quoted on the pages of Poynter and Vanity Fair regarding LifeZette\u2019s operations. He was prominently quoted in press releases touting the media company he co-founded with Ingraham, including a Business Wire blast in which he highlighted their \u201ccontent that resonates deeply with site visitors and fosters high levels of engagement.\u201d He has been written about and his work has been covered in Breitbart, Politico, HuffPost (which reported on his role in prepping a potential Senate run for Ingraham), Newsmax, and the Washington Examiner.\n\nIngraham did not respond to multiple inquiries for this story; Anthony confirmed that she was aware of them. A number of sources described her as hands-off in the day-to-day operation of the newsroom. But Martinez said he made her aware of his frequent payroll problems\n\n\u201cHer role is that she talks to Pete and Pete handles everything for her. So of course she\u2019s well aware of it,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI would cc Laura on the emails but she would never discuss any wages or finances with me or anything like that.\u201d\n\nBut it is unclear if Ingraham, the LifeZette co-founder and top editor, knew anything about Anthony\u2019s lewd comments. Sources working at the website all independently characterized Ingraham as too focused on her radio show, her book, and her next potential big career move to be aware of the myriad examples of a potential HR nightmare.\n\nFox News, where she is reportedly in talks for a coveted prime-time slot, is certainly no stranger to HR nightmares. The network has struggled recently under the weight of sexual-harassment allegations, including a number leveled at its late chief executive Roger Ailes and also hosts such as Bill O\u2019Reilly, the former Fox prime-time star who departed the network in April.\n\nA former employee who recalled multiple instances of inappropriate conduct by Anthony described Ingraham as \u201cpretty harmless,\u201d suggesting she was generally unaware of that misconduct. Aside from the occasional executive decision with respect to the site\u2019s content, she wasn\u2019t deeply involved as a manager, sources say.\n\n\u201cShe would be in the office,\u201d a former employee recalled. \u201cFor periods of time she\u2019d come in, do the radio show, she might stay in her studio for another hour working with her producers, and then she would go leave to write her book.\u201d\n\nAnother job under consideration was a top position in the Trump administration. Sources say she met with Eric Trump at the Four Seasons in Washington, D.C., during the presidential transition to interview for White House press secretary, a job that eventually went to former Republican Party spokesman Sean Spicer. \u201cWe were all on high alert that week,\u201d one former employee said, wondering what would become of LifeZette if Ingraham was offered the White House job.\n\nSources also noted that Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s former White House chief strategist and campaign CEO, had also eyed Ingraham for the role, as his preferred pick over Spicer. Bannon and Ingraham go way back, and Ingraham has publicly defended Bannon as her \u201cgood friend\u201d who was, as Ingraham would spin it, the target of a left-wing smear campaign particularly after the 2016 election.\n\nIngraham had been \u201changing out personally\u201d with Trump during the primaries, the former employee said, and helping him craft speeches in the nationalist right-wing vernacular that Ingraham has honed during a career in talk radio. She didn\u2019t land the press-secretary gig, but Spicer threw a bone to Ingraham\u2019s website in January when he kicked off a press briefing in the first week of the Trump presidency by fielding a question from LifeZette\u2019s White House reporter.\n\nIn response to that get, Anthony told Poynter that same month that \u201cthe content is all our own, we\u2019re staying away from salacious headlines and our audience is not necessarily Washington, D.C. people with time to dig into everything. We try to be less rhetoric-driven and to not chase clickbait. We\u2019d like to think that a broader spectrum gives us a different perspective.\u201d\n\nSome of LifeZette\u2019s top content has included \u201cWhat to Do If Your Teenager Is Promiscuous\u201d on the \u201cMomZette\u201d vertical, \u201cWhy So Many Women Don\u2019t Like the \u2018F-Word,\u2019\u201d and controversial and since deleted posts promoting Clinton \u201cbody count\u201d conspiracy theories. One such article was promoted under the banner of: \u201cCould crossing the Clintons kill you?\u201d\n\nDespite those and other click-ready headlines, sources say the site\u2019s traffic has been anemic. Asked what daily traffic figures looked like, one former employee estimated that its concurrent visitors were generally \u201cin the hundreds.\u201d Others said, absent a large traffic influx from a source like the Drudge Report, LifeZette readership at any given point is at most in the low thousands.\n\nAccording to data from the analytics service ComScore, LifeZette had fewer than 330,000 unique visitors in July. Anthony said that data was inaccurate\u2014the site \u201cdoes not contain ComScore tags,\u201d he said in an emailed statement\u2014and insisted that a LifeZette media kit pegging its monthly unique visitors at 6 million is entirely accurate (PDF).\n\nFormer employees, however, described a general sense of concern about LifeZette\u2019s financial health.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how or if they\u2019re making actual money,\u201d one former employee said.\n\nTwo former LifeZette staffers told The Daily Beast that a top editor at the site said privately that T. Boone Pickens, the famous financier and energy magnate, was a huge source of cash flow for the conservative-media startup. Anthony declined to discuss if Pickens had a financial relationship with the site. Pickens\u2019 spokesman did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nIn February, the Associated Press sued LifeZette for over $49,000, claiming in the complaint that the site failed to pay months of licensing fees for AP content. The lawsuit was later withdrawn.\n\nAs The Daily Beast reported out its story on LifeZette, reporters received an unsolicited email on Wednesday evening from Maureen Mackey, LifeZette\u2019s managing editor. \u201cThis is a highly driven group in a very professional environment\u2014led by our CEO Peter Anthony, whose sole focus is our business growth and development,\u201d Mackey wrote. \u201cAt LifeZette , women are very well represented on our team, including in senior editorial positions, and always have been.\u201d\n\nThe statement did not directly respond to allegations about Anthony\u2019s in-office conduct.\n\nDespite the problems besetting LifeZette, it is clear Ingraham is still determined to plug her website in high-profile media. When Ingraham is introduced on Fox News\u2014where she hopes to make her future professional home\u2014she is still introduced by hosts as the proud editor in chief of LifeZette.", "description": "\u2018Is it just me or are [her] tits getting bigger?\u2019 the conservative site\u2019s top exec said about a female colleague, according to one of seven sources who spoke with The Daily Beast.", "authors": ["Lachlan Markay", "Asawin Suebsaeng", "Betsy Woodruff", "White House Reporter", "Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1504175093/170825-swachlan-ingraham-tease_z5delw", "published_at": "2017-08-31"}
