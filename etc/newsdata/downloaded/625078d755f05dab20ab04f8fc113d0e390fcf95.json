Learning some basic words of the language if you're going abroad.\n\nAfter all, as a nation we're renowned for our good manners, so it's no surprise that for 81 per cent of those surveyed, it's important to know basics such as 'hello' and 'thank you' to make a good impression while abroad.\n\n(Image: Digital Vision)\n\nOther desirable attributes include immersing yourself in the local culture - a willingness to try local cuisine and eat at local restaurants proved a hit, as well as attending local festivals and parades (extra points for participation).\n\nAs for the biggest no-nos? Top of the list is getting drunk.\n\nOf those surveyed, 75 per cent said controlled alcohol consumption is very important when visiting a foreign country - in fact it was the second most important factor for being an ideal visitor.\n\nThat doesn't mean you can't indulge with a glass of sangria or wine, but falling into the stereotype of 'boozy Brits abroad' won't win you any favours.\n\nOther traits to avoid? Discussing sensitive topics in public, such as politics, or littering.\n\nYou can check out the full list of traits below - and see how you fare against it!\n\nTop traits of a perfect tourist", "description": "Brits have shared the top traits that determine if you're a good tourist - find out how you match up against the list", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Istockphoto", "Digital Vision"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12417602.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Working-out-what-they-want-to-see-first.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
