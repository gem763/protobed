But Future pointed to her Instagram, which features a Range Rover\n\nFibbing: The rapper also pointed to other photos indicating she's worked as a brand ambassador; pictured with his son Future Zahir Wilburn in 2017\n\nFuture's filing completely avoids the question of whether he's the father of the child, instead claiming 'the petitioner is lying about financial matters at the onset of case which is solely based on her attempt to extort money from' him.\n\nEliza's potential employment and income alone wouldn't have disqualified her from filing a paternity suit, but the move may be delayed or derailed if the presiding judge sides with the rapper's lawyers.\n\nThe Move That Dope musician also claims that Eliza actually has multiple checking accounts.\n\nThe model went on to name her child Reign Wilburn, adopting Future's legal last name.\n\nIn dispute: The Move That Dope musician also claims that Eliza actually has multiple checking accounts\n\nSeraphin may have hurt her own case when she added a link to her Instagram for a website called Just Take The Test.\n\nClicking the link takes viewers to a bare-bones site that seems to sell a single item: a white T-shirt reading '1 (800) DEADBEAT.'\n\nThe site features a single photo of her wearing the shirt, which was also posted to Instagram on October 17.\n\nIt's unclear if Seraphin is selling the shirts herself or if she's merely advertising them for another organization.\n\nUnforced error: Eliza may not have done herself any favors when she linked to a website where she appears to be selling shirts reading '1 (800) DEADBEAT\n\nStaying mum: Future didn't respond to the paternity claim but instead painted Seraphin as a liar; pictured with four of his children in 2017\n\nAfter Seraphin's filing this spring, a woman in Texas named Cindy Renae Parker claimed that the Jumpman rapper was the father of her child as well, bringing his tally up to a possible eight children.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Future (real name: Nayvadius Wilburn) initially agreed to take a paternity test but was nowhere to be found when it was time to take it.\n\nFuture most famously shares a son with R&B singer Ciara. The two dated starting in 2013, and she announced they were expecting a child the following year.\n\nHowever, the couple ended their engagement in 2015 amid rumors of his infidelities.\n\nSince then, Ciara's now-husband Russell Wilson has stepped in as a loving father.", "description": "After being sued for paternity by Instagram model Eliza Seraphin, rapper Future claimed in court filings that she lied about her income and is only looking to get money from him.", "authors": ["Brian Marks For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/22/20301698-0-image-a-56_1572301284422.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
