Those included Hurricanes Harvey and Maria and river floods.\n\nThe study of publicly available FEMA data identified 3,780 completed buyouts \u2014 those in which every building had been demolished and the land maintained as open space \u2014 from 1989 through 2017. The average buyout takes 5.7 years, the researchers said.\n\nIn all, more than 43,600 buildings were bought. Buyout costs weren\u2019t part of this study because the data was patchy, Mach said in an email.\n\nIf only communities with planners and 25% in matching funds are using FEMA\u2019s flood buyback programs, such grants probably aren\u2019t going to reach people who may need it most, said researcher A.R. Siders, an assistant professor at the University of Delaware.\n\nFEMA doesn\u2019t choose where to buy buildings: local and state governments decide whether and where to offer buyouts, David Maurstad, deputy associate administrator for insurance and mitigation, said in a response emailed Wednesday.\n\nHarris County, Texas, which undergoes a major flood about every two years, has used FEMA\u2019s buyout programs more than any other county, the researchers said. Its total of 2,190 properties is 1.5 times that for St. Charles County, Missouri, the second-biggest user.\n\nThe biggest buyout year by far was 1993 \u2014 the year of the Great Midwest Flood \u2014 with more than 8,000 properties bought, the study said.\n\nCongress boosted FEMA\u2019s share of its biggest buyout program from 50% to 75% that year, said George Haddow, who teaches at Tulane University\u2019s Disaster Resilience Leadership Academy and was not part of the study. Haddow, who was White House liaison to FEMA during President Bill Clinton\u2019s two terms, said there\u2019s never enough money to buy all the buildings people want to sell.\n\nAbout one-third of all the counties, parishes, boroughs and cities in 49 states and three territories have used buyouts, the study found.\n\nIt found that FEMA buyout grants have covered fewer properties over the years, from an average of 19 per grant in 1989-98 to an average of seven by 2009-2017. That could result in patchy change without cutting overall flood risk, the researchers wrote.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of talk about buyouts and managed retreat \u2026 but the doing is a whole lot harder than the talking,\u201d said Mark. S. Davis, director of the Tulane Institute on Water Resources Law and Policy and the Tulane Center for Environmental Law.\n\nDavis, who wasn\u2019t part of the study, said its results aren\u2019t surprising but \u201cprovide a little more rigor and some context for people trying to figure out what is working, what isn\u2019t, and what hasn\u2019t even been tried.\u201d\n\nCounties getting FEMA buyout grants have tended to use them in neighborhoods with lower income and education, the study said. It noted that the data cannot show whether planners intended to help low-income areas nor whether there\u2019s a pattern of either white flight or relocating people of color.\n\nFEMA\u2019s grant programs \u201care not designed to discriminate or address economic inequalities,\u201d and the agency doesn\u2019t collect demographic data for grants, Maurstad said.\n\nThe top three states in total property damage are in the middle of the buyout pack. Florida had $98.8 billion in damage, Louisiana $85.4 billion and Mississippi $34.2 billion.\n\nYet Florida is 24th in the number of homes purchased, Mississippi 22nd and Louisiana 19th, with a total of just over 2,000 buyouts in the three states.\n\nThe top six buyout states \u2014 Missouri, Texas, Illinois, North Carolina, Iowa and New Jersey \u2014 all are among the top 10 in damages, the researchers said.\n\n\u201cFEMA may not be a huge part of how flood risk is managed\u201d in the three states with most damage, said researcher Caroline Kraan, a doctoral student at Stanford University and the University of Miami.\n\n___\n\nFollow Janet McConnaughey on Twitter: @JanetMcCinNO", "description": "NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 FEMA buys flood-prone homes more often in wealthy, populous counties than in poor, rural areas, even though lower-income rural areas", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/10/762b39_fema-flood-buyouts-12220-aerial-in-aug-29-2017-file-photo-neighborhood-addicks-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
