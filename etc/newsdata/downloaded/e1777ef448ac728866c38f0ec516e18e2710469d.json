Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nYou've only got a small handful of options for buying a Google Pixel, although on the bright side, you won't have to spend a ton of time sifting through retailers to find the best deal. You can order it directly from the Google Store and Verizon \u2014 these are often the best places to find deals.\n\nVerizon often has trade-in and \"buy one, get one\" offers that can save you a bundle of cash. The only downside is that your new phone will be locked to that carrier, so you'll have to stick with Verizon while you own the phone.\n\nBest Buy also offers Pixel phones locked to Verizon or Sprint, though, often with discounts attached if you sign on with the carrier at the time of purchase.\n\nIf your carrier isn't Verizon and you don't want to switch, you can buy the Pixel phone unlocked from a variety of retailers, including Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy. If you're on T-Mobile, Sprint, or AT&T, this is a great way to buy the Pixel phone.\n\nIf you're buying unlocked, Amazon and Walmart are good choices for saving a bit of money off retail pricing if there aren't any other good deals to be had elsewhere and you don't want to wait for a sale. These two retailers also occasionally have sales on Pixel phones.\n\nEditor's note: Some of the prices below, particularly carrier offers, do not factor in ongoing promotions or other special sales that come and go fairly frequently. Prices from retailers like Amazon also fluctuate regularly. Be sure to check and see what trade-in discounts, BOGO deals, and other savings might be on offer right now.\n\nGoogle Pixel 3\n\nGoogle: Unlocked for $799 (64GB), $899 (128GB)\n\nUnlocked for $799 (64GB), $899 (128GB) Google Fi: Unlocked for $799 (64GB), $899 (128GB)\n\nUnlocked for $799 (64GB), $899 (128GB) Verizon: Locked to Verizon for $800 (64GB), $900 (128GB)\n\nLocked to Verizon for $800 (64GB), $900 (128GB) Amazon: Unlocked for $699-$729 (64GB), $860 (128GB)\n\nUnlocked for $699-$729 (64GB), $860 (128GB) Best Buy: Unlocked for $700 (64GB), $800 (128GB)\n\nGoogle Pixel 3 XL\n\nGoogle: Unlocked for $899 (64GB), $999 (128GB)\n\nUnlocked for $899 (64GB), $999 (128GB) Google Fi: Unlocked for $899 (64GB), $999 (128GB)\n\nUnlocked for $899 (64GB), $999 (128GB) Verizon: Locked to Verizon for $930 (64GB), $1,030 (128GB)\n\nLocked to Verizon for $930 (64GB), $1,030 (128GB) Amazon: Unlocked for $689-$720 (64GB), $865-$880 (128GB)\n\nUnlocked for $689-$720 (64GB), $865-$880 (128GB) Best Buy: Unlocked for $800 (64GB), $900 (128GB)\n\nGoogle Pixel 3a\n\nAmazon: Unlocked for $399 (64GB)\n\nUnlocked for $399 (64GB) Google: Unlocked for $399 (64GB)\n\nUnlocked for $399 (64GB) Google Fi: Unlocked for $399 (64GB)\n\nUnlocked for $399 (64GB) Verizon: Locked to Verizon for $400 (64GB)\n\nLocked to Verizon for $400 (64GB) Walmart (Black, White): Unlocked for $399 (64GB)\n\nUnlocked for $399 (64GB) Best Buy: Unlocked for $300-$400 (64GB)\n\nGoogle Pixel 3a XL", "description": "The Google Pixel phones have become increasingly popular, but you can only buy them at certain retailers.
