(Photo: Shannon Heupel/Advertiser)\n\nMONTGOMERY, Ala. \u2013 A real estate agent was fired after posting an advertisement encouraging people to use his home selling services if they were upset after the Montgomery election when the voters elected an African American to be mayor.\n\n\"Hey Montgomery, Don't Like The Election Results?? CALL ME!! Let's SELL That Home While The Market Is HOT!,\" the Facebook advertisement with an eXp Realty logo said.\n\nThe dog-whistle advertisement with Craig Schaid posing in it was posted after Steven Reed was elected Tuesday night to lead the city of Montgomery, which has a majority black population but never has had an African American in its highest office.\n\nCynthia Novak, eXP vice president of marketing and communications, told the Advertiser in an e-mail that the company was not aware of the advertisement before it was posted and fired Schaid after learning of it.\n\n\"We reviewed the situation and terminated the agent. He is no longer an agent with eXp,\" Novak wrote. \"In addition, we are discussing how we advocate for diversity and inclusion and will educate all staff and agents on these matters.\"\n\nSchaid could not be reached when the Advertiser contacted him Thursday.\n\n\u2018A historic day\u2019:: Montgomery, Alabama, elects its first African-American mayor\n\nScreen shot of Craig Schaid's advertisement.

The company awards stock to agents as a reward for hitting sales goals and recruiting new agents.\n\nReed beat television station owner David Woods in a runoff election runoff in a landslide.\n\nReed, who was also Montgomery County\u2019s first African-American probate judge, spoke of inclusiveness and opportunity for all in his victory speech Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cThis election has never about just my ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been about all of the hopes and dreams that we have as individuals and collectively in this city \u2026 and the way we found the opportunity to improve outcomes regardless of neighborhood, regardless of Zip code, regardless of anything that may divide us or make us different from one another.\u201d\n\nFollow Sara MacNeil on Twitter: @sara_macneil\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/10/montgomery-real-estate-agent-fired-after-ad-election-black-mayor/3937758002/", "description": "The advertisement was posted after Steven Reed was elected Montgomery\u2019s first African-American mayor.", "authors": ["Sara Macneil", "Published P.M.
