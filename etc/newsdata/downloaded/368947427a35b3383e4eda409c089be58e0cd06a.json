With impeachment now a near certainty, there is only one group of legislators that ultimately matters: the 100 jurors who make up the U.S. Senate. Of that group, 53 Republicans will have their partisan loyalties tested. And of that group, 20 Republicans \u2014 the minimum necessary for conviction \u2014 hold the fate of the president in their hands.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat are Republicans in this position thinking? Here is my best guess, based on a few conversations with GOP legislators over the last week:\n\nYou moralizing columnists have it easy. I have to live in the real political world. I know President Trump is deeply flawed. But I saw how Democrats and much of the media questioned his legitimacy from the very beginning, making Republicans in my state deeply suspicious about any impeachment process. I don\u2019t think the current process, so far, has been particularly open or fair. And there is a lot at stake. The Democratic Party seems to become more extreme by the day. Ideas such as Medicare-for-all, which once were ideological ceilings, have become floors. I think Elizabeth Warren would be a disaster as president, and I really don\u2019t want to do anything to make her election more likely.\n\nBesides, you have no idea what politics is like in my state. The old GOP is gone. Coming out against Trump directly would be seen as an act of treason in the culture war \u2014 as a surrender to cosmopolitan socialism. Republicans would never forgive me. And I probably wouldn\u2019t get any credit from the other side anyway. So, at least for the moment, my best option is to remain silent on the substance of impeachment, attack the process and see how things unfold.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI don\u2019t agree with this line of reasoning, but I don\u2019t discount the difficulties faced by Senate Republicans. Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) has shown conspicuous political courage in his criticisms of the president. But I understand why other GOP senators would want to be the 10th to break with Trump rather than the second.\n\nThe justifications for remaining loyal to the president, however, are increasingly inadequate for a number of reasons:\n\nFirst, there is the shocking obviousness of the Ukraine quid pro quo. As the testimony of William B. Taylor Jr., the acting ambassador to Ukraine demonstrated, everyone involved knew exactly what was happening. And the effort to squeeze political benefit out of a foreign government was much broader than a single phone call. The president\u2019s fig-leaf defense \u2014 no quid pro quo \u2014 has been removed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSecond, there is the foreign policy nightmare of abandoning the Kurds in such a brutish fashion, and then abandoning Syria to Russian influence. This has been a reminder of the real-world consequences of having an impulsive, blathering dolt as commander in chief.\n\nThird, there has been Trump\u2019s predictable turn toward racially provocative language (describing his impeachment as a \u201clynching\u201d) when he gets into trouble.\n\nSo, if you are an elected Republican who wants to remain loyal to the president, you need to defend an indefensible act of corruption, explain a massive national security blunder and sacrifice your moral integrity to excuse racism. And add to this the certain knowledge that Trump would not defend you for half a second if it didn\u2019t immediately benefit him.\n\nAD\n\nThis creates a political environment in which conviction has moved from impossible to unlikely. The national erosion of Trump\u2019s support has been significant. This has taken away the political risk for Democrats moving forward with impeachment. But the removal of the president will probably depend on public opinion among Republicans in 20 red or purple states. In most such places, at least for Republican officeholders, the political cost of criticizing the president remains high. Growing support for Trump\u2019s impeachment has generally resulted from the hardening of existing opposition, not the wearing away of support in the GOP.\n\nAD\n\nGiven the depth and durability of the United States\u2019 political divisions, and the deep redness of many red states, this may never happen. Yet, for Republican senators, the full cost of complicity in Trump\u2019s corruption is becoming clear.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "For a number of reasons, the justifications for remaining loyal to the president are increasingly inadequate.", "authors": ["Michael Gerson"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Cay9jU2tKhytpLPlWM1MCVHNh8o=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NOJYBZXWQUI6TIUFRAVI4ODKSY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
