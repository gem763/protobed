It also added it does \"not agree with all the recommendations,\" without specifying which ones.\n\nOne way to punish this elite group of travelers is to \"introduce regulation to ban frequent flyer reward schemes that stimulate demand,\" the researchers said. It did not give specifics.\n\nFrequent flyer programs \u2014 provided by almost all airlines around the world \u2014 are designed to reward and encourage customers for traveling with the same airline, by giving them the option to upgrade their class, or get free flights, if they rack up a certain amount of points.\n\nSome passengers take extra flights to reach or maintain benefits with certain airlines, which is the kind of behavior the proposal would target.\n\nThe researchers' proposal could discourage flyers from remaining loyal to certain airlines or discourage them from flying as much as before.\n\nAirlines would also risk losing out to competitors as travelers lose incentive to stay loyal.\n\nAirlines who partner with banks to issue airline-branded credit cards could also lose revenue, as they currently receive money from the bank for every mile the card user accrues, Bloomberg reported in 2017.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A general view of Heathrow Airport near London, Britain, October 11, 2016.
