Then the bullpen gave up four to the Miami Marlins in the seventh, collapsing once again, making it fair to wonder how this team can survive with such shaky relievers. The latest disappointment led to a 5-3 loss to the last-place Marlins. Hunter Strickland gave them life by allowing a leadoff homer in the decisive seventh. Wander Suero, pitching for the third straight day, was charged with the final two runs and his ninth loss.\n\nBy failing to sweep the Marlins, Washington is now tied with the Milwaukee Brewers for the National League\u2019s top wild-card spot. The Chicago Cubs are four games back after suffering their sixth straight loss. Washington is set up to appear in the wild-card game Oct. 1, barring a serious meltdown this week, but a nagging question has not gone away: Which relievers can Manager Dave Martinez count on when the pressure builds?\n\n\u201cYou see guys come in one day and be really good for us and get big outs for us. The next day it just doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cLet\u2019s just get consistent. We got a few games left. Let\u2019s come back tomorrow and take another lead, and I trust all those guys in the bullpen. They know what\u2019s at stake.\u201d\n\n[Boswell: Playoff chases are fun, aren\u2019t they, Nats fans? Why are you hiding under your desk?]\n\nThe Nationals had nudged ahead by scratching across a run in the first and two in the fourth. The last one came in when Voth poked his first career hit into center and brought Brian Dozier around from second. The 27-year-old right-hander had allowed a run in the first after Magneuris Sierra tripled and scored on a sacrifice fly. Yet that was all Miami got off Voth in his five innings of work.\n\nVoth mostly leaned on his mid-90s fastball and his curveball because a cut keeps bothering him on his right pointer finger. That makes it hard to throw his slider or change-up for strikes. At one point in the outing, as his pitch count climbed toward its total of 81, Voth was throwing only fastballs and showing his off-speed stuff as a decoy. But the fastball-curve combination was enough to hold a lowly lineup in check.\n\nThose are the pitches that helped him twice earn the fifth starter spot this season. They are also the pitches that could help him sneak onto the wild-card game roster as a reliever. The Nationals will spend the next week taking stock of what they have, from their depth starters, bench and, of course, their bullpen. Martinez is still figuring out who he can trust in the sixth and seventh innings, even in late September, even after the Nationals tried to address those spots with three trade deadline acquisitions.\n\nDaniel Hudson and Sean Doolittle, who didn\u2019t appear this weekend, promise to be his top high-leverage relievers for however long this team plays. But the rest of the bullpen remains a complete question mark. Suero allowed two inherited runners to score in a win here Friday. Fernando Rodney gave up a four-run lead before the Nationals rallied for another victory Saturday. Now it was Strickland and Suero\u2019s turn, their chance to prove something, but they couldn\u2019t get the job done.\n\n\u201cThrow strikes and just get outs,\u201d Martinez said, visibly frustrated, when discussing Sunday\u2019s meltdown. \u201cThe biggest thing is getting outs. When you give up a run, you give up a run, but we just got to get outs. We got to get outs late in the game.\u201d\n\n[Sean Doolittle has struggled to rediscover what made him successful. So he changed.]\n\nStrickland, acquired at the deadline for big spots, turned in a clean sixth inning Sunday. But he gave up that leadoff homer in the seventh before plunking Lewis Brinson. Martinez was most frustrated with the hit batter. Strickland is frustrated because he can\u2019t get ahead in counts. Suero then entered, threw away a pickoff throw for the second time in three games, and struck out Curtis Granderson to steady the inning.\n\nBut he had trouble with his command outside Granderson\u2019s at-bat. He walked Sierra before giving up a two-run double to Jon Berti. Tanner Rainey came in, looking to put out the fire, and allowed an RBI triple to Starlin Castro before the inning was over. And Suero\u2019s erratic cutter was at the center of another defeat.\n\nThis has happened a few times in the second half. Sometimes Suero\u2019s cutter is sharp, and sometimes it\u2019s \u201ctoo big\u201d and the movement confuses him. He feels like his adrenaline may be too high on the mound. He cited fatigue as another possible factor for the cutter\u2019s inconstencity. The 28-year-old added that his workload, a team-high 75 appearances after this one, is not an excuse. He just has to figure it out, and fast.\n\n\u201cIt just sucks,\u201d Strickland said of his performance. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way around it, no other word for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe my release point, I just don\u2019t know,\u201d Suero said, a few lockers over from Strickland, of what goes wrong with his cutter. \u201cOnce I get in the game, at times, it changes.\u201d\n\nOnce it was over, and once the Nationals didn\u2019t help themselves in the wild-card race, three different relievers had given up the Marlins\u2019 last three run-scoring hits. That\u2019s not a typical losing formula for most teams. The problem for Washington \u2014 on Sunday, yes, but more so moving forward \u2014 is that it\u2019s still so far from an anomaly.", "description": "By failing to sweep the Marlins, who won 5-3, Washington could soon be tied with the Milwaukee Brewers for the National League\u2019s top wild-card spot.", "authors": ["Jesse Dougherty", "Reporter Covering The Washington Nationals.", "September At Pm", "Jesse Dougherty Covers The Washington Nationals."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/u27ypbL33L42vd8JiBhoJfN01PM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2IENFVG5PAI6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
