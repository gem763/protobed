As always, Trump answered some questions from the press in the Oval Office, where the question about what to do with the scores of ISIS prisoners we\u2019ve been holding since we destroyed the caliphate. Granted, the Islamic State holds no large swaths of territory anymore, but that doesn\u2019t mean these people, their operatives, or their poisonous ideas have left. Trump wants Europe to take back their share of the fighters, their citizens specifically. If they don\u2019t, he threatened to dump them in Europe, where they would have to recapture them all over again (via NY Post):\n\nPresident Trump has a message for Europe regarding the captured ISIS terrorists being held in the U.S. that came from their countries. pic.twitter.com/wDbAPqU79H \u2014 Townhall.com (@townhallcom) September 20, 2019\n\nPresident Trump on Friday renewed his threat to dump ISIS prisoners back to the European countries they hailed from \u2014 saying the US would drop them at the border and the Europeans will \u201chave to capture them again.\u201d \u201cI defeated the caliphate. When I came, the caliphate was all over the place. I defeated the caliphate, ISIS, and now we have thousands of prisoners of war, ISIS fighters that are prisoners of war, and we\u2019re asking the countries from which they came \u2026 from Europe, We\u2019re asking them to take back these prisoners of war,\u201d the president told reporters alongside Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison at the White House. \u201cSo far, they\u2019ve refused, and at some point, I\u2019m going to have to say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, you either take them back or we\u2019re going to let them go at your border.\u2019 And if they don\u2019t take them back, we\u2019re going to probably put them at the border and then they\u2019ll have to capture them again,\u201d Trump continued. The commander in chief\u2019s comments came after he was asked about possible retaliation against Iran.\n\nThat\u2019s a whole other perilous situation, where Iran, a state sponsor of terrorism, reportedly launched a drone and cruise missile strike on Saudi Arabian oilfields. In response, Trump has slapped on more sanctions and has deployed a small contingent of troops to the region. Missile defense equipment will also be sent. This isn\u2019t the first time the president has had to have stern words with Europe. NATO contributions were another point of contention, though European nations are now contributing more and have, in turn, strengthened the state of the alliance. Trump probably won\u2019t unload thousands of ISIS terrorists\u2014but you never know. The president doesn\u2019t want to hold these people anymore. Let\u2019s make a deal.", "description": ".09/25/2019 0:38:29AM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/266/f0477a3c-777c-4c62-a159-ebc5fa78f43e.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
