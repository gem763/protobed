The freaky brute-ape is one of the series\u2019 oldest and most difficult monsters, a perfect challenge for a cocky hunter. He arrived in Monster Hunter World today and is already kicking all kinds of arse.\n\nI haven\u2019t had the luxury of fighting Rajang yet since I\u2019ve recently been stalking through Ghost Recon Wildlands, but I know that whenever we do face off, it\u2019s gonna hurt. Rajang was first introduced in 2006\u2019s Monster Hunter 2, with tons of terrifying variants throughout the years including the raging Furious Rajang.\n\nFighting a Rajang and surviving is a rite of passage for players, often one of the toughest tests available. Monster Hunter World\u2019s latest expansion Iceborne is a massive celebration of all things Monster Hunter. Alongside new creatures, it\u2019s brought back fan favourites like the dragon-panther Nargacuga and the sword-tailed Glavenus. Players knew Rajang was coming for some time, and he arrived with a splash.\n\nOne of Monster Hunter World\u2019s best mechanics is \u201cturf wars\u201d between monsters. If two beasts cross paths, they battle in incredibly detailed fights. These usually end with both monsters receiving tons of damage. WIth certain monsters, like the dinosaur pickle Deviljho, it\u2019s been a chance to show off how freakishly strong high-tier monsters are.\n\nRajang\u2019s turf wars are absolutely bonkers, to the point that I gasped way too loud in my office today while watching them. There\u2019s the moment where Rajang forced Deviljho\u2019s jaw open and literally punches them inside the mouth. There\u2019s also what might be the most brutal and shocking piece of violence in the entire game: Rajang grabbing the lightning horse Kirin and breaking their damn neck, busting off their horn as well. Oh my god, are you seeing this?\n\nOh, I also haven\u2019t mentioned that Rajang can power up and literally go Super Saiyan to smack hapless hunters around.\n\nIf you manage to take Rajang down, there are some great rewards. Rajang\u2019s armour doesn\u2019t just look good; it has some genuinely fantastic bonuses. Among these are the Mind\u2019s Eye skill if you have two pieces, which prevents your weapons from deflecting off tough monster hide.\n\nThere\u2019s also a four-piece bonus that prevents weapons from losing sharpness for a time after you use your whetstone. There are also tons of attack boosts that increase damage when hitting weak points and boost attack whenever you have red, recoverable damage in your health bar.\n\nAs a dual blades user who needs high attack and whose weapons run out of sharpness quickly, this set is a godsend. Farming Rajang means I will look fabulous and kick significantly more butt.\n\nIceborne\u2019s really stepped up and brought new life to Monster Hunter World. While there\u2019s always been new events and new monsters, the pace of updates had slowed down. Rajang offers challenge, old-school nostalgia, and powerful rewards. If all additions are as exciting as this, hunters will have a lot to look forward to as Monster Hunter World continues.", "description": "Ask a Monster Hunter player to name a beast that evokes equal parts dread and excitement and you\u2019ll get one name: Rajang.
