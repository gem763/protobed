Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin shake hands in Helsinki - but there are growing fears of a new arms race between their two countries\n\nFears of an arms race have grown after the U.S. formally withdrew from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty in August, a move it had been signalling since last year.\n\nThe 1987 pact signed by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev had banned ground-launched weapons with ranges between 300 and 3,400 miles.\n\nBut Washington accused Moscow of violating the treaty and producing illegal missiles.\n\nEarlier this year the U.S. tested a modified ground-launched version of a U.S. Navy Tomahawk cruise missile, which would have been banned under the treaty.\n\nPutin urged his own defence chiefs to 'take comprehensive measures to prepare a symmetrical answer'.\n\nEuropean leaders have voiced fears over the consequences of the treaty's demise, amid concerns of an arms race not seen since the Cold War.\n\nHowever NATO said in a statement in February the U.S. allies 'fully support' the withdrawal and agreed that Russia's 9M729 missile violated the pact.", "description": "Russia's defence ministry released footage (pictured) of the Bulava missile being launched from the nuclear-powered submarine Prince Vladimir in the White Sea in northern Russia.", "authors": ["Will Stewart For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/12/20374560-0-image-a-44_1572439002842.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
