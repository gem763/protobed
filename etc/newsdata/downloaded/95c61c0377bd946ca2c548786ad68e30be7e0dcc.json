REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha\n\nThe pro-China demonstrators chanted \u201cSupport the police\u201d and \u201cChina, add oil\u201d at the Kowloon Bay mall, adapting a line used by anti-Hong Kong government protesters and loosely meaning: \u201cChina, keep your strength up\u201d.\n\n\u201cHong Kong is China,\u201d one woman shouted at passersby who shouted obscenities in return in an angry pushing and pulling standoff.\n\nThe clashes spilled out on to the streets, with each confrontation captured by dozens of media and onlookers on their smart phones. Police detained several people.\n\nProtesters complaining about perceived Chinese meddling in the former British colony came out in their hundreds across the territory on Friday, singing and chanting on the Mid-Autumn Festival, in contrast to the violence of many previous weekends when police have responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon.\n\nThey have also gathered in malls, with occasional scuffles with flag-carrying China supporters, often denouncing police for perceived brutality.\n\nAnti-government protesters were also gathering in the downtown Central district and in the northwestern New Territories district of Tin Shui Wai.\n\nThe spark for the anti-government protests was a now-withdrawn extradition bill and concerns that Beijing is eroding civil liberties, but many young protesters are also angry about sky-high living costs and a lack of job prospects.\n\nThe bill would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts, but the protests have now broadened into calls for greater democracy.\n\nHong Kong returned to China under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland - including a much-cherished independent legal system.\n\nChina says Hong Kong is now its internal affair. It says it is committed to the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement and denies meddling in Hong Kong\u2019s affairs.\n\nChina is eager to quell the unrest before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China on Oct. 1. It has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest.", "description": "Hong Kong police moved in to break up scuffles on Sunday between pro-China protesters and those denouncing perceived Chinese meddling, in an around a shopping mall at the start of demonstrations across the city after months of unrest.", "authors": ["Martin Pollard", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429628664&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8D00F", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
