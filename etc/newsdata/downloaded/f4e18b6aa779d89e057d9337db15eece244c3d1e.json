Collapse OS is a new open source operating system built specifically for use during humanity's darkest days. According to its creator, software developer Virgil Dupras, Collapse OS is what the people of the future will need to reconfigure their scavenged iPhones. For now, though, he's hosting the project on GitHub and looking for contributors.\n\n\u201cI'm doing this to mitigate a risk that I think is real. Not inevitable, but likely enough to warrant a modest effort,\u201d Dupras said in an email.\n\nAccording to the Collapse OS site, Dupras envisions a world where the global supply chain collapses by 2030. In this possible future\u2014kind of a medium-apocalypse\u2014populations won\u2019t be able to mass produce electronics anymore, but they\u2019ll still be an enormous source of political and social power. Anyone who can scavenge electronics and reprogram them will gain a huge advantage over those who don't.\n\nDupras believes that the biggest problem for tech savvy post-apocalyptic people will be microcontrollers\u2014tiny computers embedded in circuit boards that control the functions of computer systems.\n\n\u201cComputers, after a couple of decades, will break down beyond repair and we won't be able to program microcontrollers any more,\u201d the Collapse OS website explains. \u201cTo avoid this fate, we need to have a system that can be designed from scavenged parts and program microcontrollers.\u201d\n\nCollapse OS will work with Z80 8-bit microprocessors. Though less common today than 16- and 32-bit components, the 8-bit Z80 can be found in desktop computers, cash registers, musical instruments, graphing calculators, and everything in between. In a Reddit Q&A, Dupras explained that the Z80 was chosen \"because it's been in production for so long and because it's been used in so many machines, scavenger have good chances of getting their hands on it.\"\n\nAccording to Dupras, Collapse OS must \u201crun on minimal and improvised machines, interface through improvised [keyboards, displays, and mice], edit text files, compile assembler source files for a wide range of MCUs and CPUS, read and write from a wide range of storage devices, and replicate itself.\u201d\n\nAccording to the product page, Collapse OS currently can run on a homebrew Z80-based computer called the RC2014, and on Reddit Dupras said it could theoretically run on a Sega Genesis console.\n\nDupras said he's happy with the project\u2019s progress. \u201cI think I could finish it by myself, but I thought it would be more fun to do with a couple of other developers,\u201d he said. \u201cParticipation requires a very specific set of inclinations (believing in collapse) and skills (electronics and z80 assembly). I think that very few people fitting those requirements exist. But if they do, I'd like to find them.\u201d", "description": "The operating system is designed to work with ubiquitous, easy-to-scavenge components in a future where consumer electronics are a thing of the past.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9ba632e31505000ab4e924/lede/1570481767489-sdfdsfasdf.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8455xh;0xw,0.1218xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
