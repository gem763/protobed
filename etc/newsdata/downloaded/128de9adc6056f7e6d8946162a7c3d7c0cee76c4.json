His material is very organized in a way to help the beginning of accumulation. He often mentioned in the podcast that he has other 50% of portfolios managed by the professional using some kind of timing approach or similar system. I am more curious about that now. He has not mention much of details on how to utilize that. I do understand such system doesn't improve performance in the long run say 20-60 years, however, it helps a great deal minimize the 1-10 years span volatility.\n\nYBB's approach provide a guideline to monitor the overall SD of portfolio compare to SP500, which I think it's first step to monitor the risk as a whole. What I still have to figure out, when it comes time to adjust each individual holding within the portfolio, is there a more system/rule to use for each holding, instead of re balance btw stock and bond as a whole?\n\nThere are times both stock and bond went down. I might able to accept stock go down 20%, but I am not willing to accept bond go down 5%.\n\nFor instance, for a 50/50 portfolio, then I am looking at 12.5% draw down maximum. I think a lot of people use 200MA or similar. I have not used any timing system, not sure how to apply it the best.\n\nHope people with such experience can also share.", "description": "1.
