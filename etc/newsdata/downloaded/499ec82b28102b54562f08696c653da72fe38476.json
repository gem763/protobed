VW bought the brand back in 1986 and hadn\u2019t really been sure what to do with it. It tried the passion thing, and had a stab at making it into the \u201cSpanish Alfa\u201d.\n\nThen there was a tilt at turning the Seat into another value brand like in-house VW group rival Skoda. None of the stratagems worked out that well. And then they just gave up. Crucially, Seat didn\u2019t have any products to offer in the fastest-growing sector of the market \u2013 SUVs \u2013 and the range was getting old. There were dark rumours about VW finding the financial burden too much to bear. There was bleakness, and a whiff of decay.\n\nThen they gave Seat a chance and the team in Barcelona started to design some fine products \u2013 sparky little SUVs such as the Ateca and Arona, plus ever madder, faster, more virile versions of the Leon and Leon estate, their Golf-based family hatch contender. Lately they\u2019ve even, quietly, launched a new premium brand, Cupra. There\u2019s an electric city car based on the current Mii, plus an even bigger radically styled Cupra SUV coupe (the Tarascan) on the way.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe results have been heartening, with a sales revival, a better, more successful image, and a new purpose in life. It\u2019s been a product-led rather than a sloganeering, marketing-led revival, which makes it all the more sustainable. Seat just started making more cars people want, without self-consciously attempting to define some arbitrary identity or brand values for a firm that once assembled Fiats and was never, in truth, an especially innovative marque.\n\nThe cars still speak for themselves, but now more convincingly, with an authentic accent. It\u2019s how the modern VW group survived, and mostly prospered, after the Beetle. It works.\n\nThe spec Seat Tarraco XCellence Lux 2.0 4Drive Price: \u00a336,820 (as tested, range starts at \u00a327,750)\n\nEngine capacity: 2.0 diesel, 4-cyl, 7-sp Auto (DSG)\n\nPower output (PS @ rpm): 190@4,200-6,000\n\nTop speed (mph): 131\n\n0-60mph (seconds): 8\n\nFuel economy (mpg): 29.7\n\nCO2 emissions (g/km): 166\n\nIt\u2019s good to see the latest step on the revival \u2013 the Seat Tarraco. This is a full-size SUV, indeed an optional five and seven seater, and very much a VW group product, with controls, engines, gearboxes and much else shared with the Volkswagen Touran and the Skoda Kodiaq.\n\nSo much of it is a VW group product made at the famous Wolfsburg works in Germany, home of VW since before the war.\n\nIf you prised the badges off the Tarraco it would pass easily as any of its siblings, and that\u2019s no bad thing. It has that solid feel, ease of use and impression of quality that customers love, and has allowed VW to get past all that distasteful unpleasantness and stay very much in business. I\u2019m not sure what it tells us about consumer power forcing environmental action, but that\u2019s another column. I wonder if Caroline Lucas or the Greta Thunberg family run for a family car?\n\nTalking of which, for now there\u2019s no battery electric or hybrid versions of this Seat, though you can order a plug-in hybrid next year. The smaller petrol engine option is a bit too feeble to cope with this hefty bit of kit.\n\nThe diesels, leaving politics aside, are far better, and you should go for the more powerful version with the automatic gearbox. Unless you\u2019re a hill farmer, you don\u2019t need four-wheel drive, obviously, and certainly not with the absurdly big alloy wheels and thin tyres.\n\nThese, together with the Seat\u2019s near lines, bold grille and sharp creases down the flanks give it an Audi vibe: typical VW group again, and the theme continues in the cabin.\n\nThere\u2019s a very sober, tasteful interior with plenty of space. I especially liked the big colour graphics for the dials on the dash, and the big comfy leather seats. The air con coped well with our recent heatwave, I can report.\n\nThe third row of seats fold out of the boot floor, and are suitable only for small children \u2013 there\u2019s literally no leg room for the over-5s.\n\nWith these auxillary little seats up, there\u2019s very little boot space left, the usual story in these sorts of car, as it happens, so don\u2019t be deceived that you can carry seven humans and all their chattels \u2013 there are trade-offs.\n\nMy only gripe in day-to-day usage was that the cruise control is still located on a little pod to the back of the steering wheel, rather than in the wheel itself, which is a bit old-fashioned and fiddly these days.\n\nMy four-wheel drive press car went well, with surprisingly rapid acceleration and safe and predictable handling, just as you would want in a family car. It managed to haul itself onto the odd curb too, but the massive alloy wheels and thin tyres rule out proper off-roading, which does make you ask yourself if these SUvs are anything more than mere fashion accessories (they ain\u2019t).\n\nThe new car market is so crowded and competitive, in even this niche sub-sector of seven-seater SUVs the buyer has plenty of choice \u2013 the capable Nissan X-Trail, the civilised Peugeot 5008, odd-looking Honda CR-V and value Kia Sorento, to name just a few. Alternatively, you could probably do almost as well for rather less with the almost-forgotten Seat Alhambra, a full seven-seater MPV (ie seven adults). It\u2019s an old design now, a relic of the MPV boom that gave us the Renault Espace and Citroen Picasso, if you remember those carefree pre-SUV obsessed days. The Alhambra is not a big seller, and hardly state-of-the-art, but that probably means bargains if you go online and do a bit of research. Apart from the blistering performance Leons, Seat doesn\u2019t exactly add to the gaiety of nations, but they do make decent, competent cars and I\u2019m glad they\u2019re still around.\n\nSearch for used cars", "description": "A few years back\u00a0Seat was a car brand\u00a0in a pretty sorry state: neglected, in fact.
