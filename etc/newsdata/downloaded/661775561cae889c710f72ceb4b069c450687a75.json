I personally submitted those documents and merely redacted e-mail addresses and phone numbers,\" Jared Watson told SowetanLIVE.\n\nWhen News24 reached Agrizzi for comment, he said: \"It's absolutely ridiculous. I am not going to comment.\"\n\nHowever, in a response to TimesLIVE, he said that the \"truth is out there, verified by the Zondo [commission] investigators\".\n\nHe also claimed that there was an \"agenda that I don't see fit to comment on\".\n\nNews24 previously reported that Agrizzi would return to the commission to apologise for suggesting that Department of Correctional Services official Jabu Sishuba received bribes from the company.\n\nCommission chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo said Agrizzi had indicated that he would repeat what he said in his affidavit, that he made an error when he suggested that African Global Operations (formerly Bosasa) or any entities related to it, had paid bribes to Sishuba.\n\n- Compiled by Sesona Ngqakamba\n\n\n\n", "description": "Former Bosasa COO-turned-whistleblower Angelo Agrizzi has been accused of lying under oath at the state capture inquiry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8551/5c8ba56e8ffa400ba7fc91d70c9a92d9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
