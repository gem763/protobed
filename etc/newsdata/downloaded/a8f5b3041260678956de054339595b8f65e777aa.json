But party leaders in Beijing have been trying to manage the deceleration to levels more consistent with China\u2019s status as a middle-income country. The economy grew at 6.6 percent last year.\n\nAD\n\nThe trade war that Trump declared 18 months ago has complicated those efforts, but not as much as he has claimed. The impact from the tariffs and other restrictions has shaved only a fraction of a percentage point off the growth rate, economists say.\n\nAD\n\nBeijing has struck a staunch tone throughout the trade dispute, while also wanting to bring it to an end.\n\nAfter talks in Washington last week, Trump said the two sides had agreed to a \u201cphase one\u201d deal in which China would agree to buy between $40 billion and $50 billion of American farm products, while the United States would delay a planned increase in tariffs.\n\nBut the Chinese side has struck a different tone, referring only to \u201cprogress\u201d rather than a \u201cdeal.\u201d\n\nNegotiators from both sides are due to meet again next week.\n\nAt a meeting Thursday with Evan Greenberg, chairman of the U.S.-China Business Council, in Beijing, Premier Li Keqiang urged the United States to \u201cresolve relevant issues through dialogue and consultation on the basis of equality and mutual respect, so as to advance bilateral economic and trade ties on the right track,\u201d according to Chinese state media.\n\n\n\nAD", "description": "Domestic demand is cooling in the world\u2019s second-largest economy, hampering expansion.", "authors": ["Anna Fifield", "Beijing Bureau Chief."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/mOiJrXFpVXh2oIShX8rXlSfmqLM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YVNVSNXRLYI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
