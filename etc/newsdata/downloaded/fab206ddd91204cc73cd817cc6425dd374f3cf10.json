In the 2 016-2017 scho ol year, 85% of seniors graduated on time, up from 84% the previous ye ar and 80% five years prior. In the United States, high school graduates are more likel y to be in better h ealth, less likely to be unemployed, and typically earn about 28% more annually than those who have not completed high school. In light of the benefits associated with a high school education, the climbing graduation rate comes as encouraging news. While the national high school graduation rate is at its highest level in years, there are parts of the country where graduation rates far exceed the national rate. 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the share of high school seniors who graduated on time in 382 U.S. metropolitan areas to identify the cities where the most people graduate from high school. All data on high school graduation is from 2019 County Health Rankings & Roadmaps , a collaboration between the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, American adults with a high school diploma are far more likely to have a secure job than those who have not completed high school. Th e 5.6% 2018 unemploym ent rate among adults 25 and older who did not complete high school is considerably higher than the 4.1% rate among adults who completed high school and did not go on to college. In every city on this list, the high school graduation rate for the 2016-2017 school year is over 91%. Perhaps not surprisingly, in the majority of these cities, the annual unemployment rate is lower than the 3.9% national average. Of course, when it comes to local and regional job markets, the educational attainment of the workforce is only part of the equation. Another important factor is whether the number of available jobs is keeping pace with the demand for work. Here is a look at the U.S. cities that have added the most jobs in the last five years . While earning a high school diploma can be critical to ensuring one\u2019s future financial security, Americans who go on to college are even better qualified for high-paying careers. The typical college graduate in the United States earns $54,628 annually -- or $23,359 more than those whose highest level of education is high school. However, high school graduates are still qualified for several high-paying careers, even some that pay more than many of those available only to college graduates. Here is a list of the highest paying jobs you can get without a college degree . It is important to not that while high school graduates typically earn more than those who have not completed high school, there are exceptions. In five of the 50 metro areas on this list, median earnings among high school graduates are lower than the annual median for those who did not complete high school.

High school graduation rates are defined as the percentage of the ninth-grade cohort that graduates in four years. The data represents students graduating on time in the 2016-2017 school year, the most recent available.\n\nIn metro areas with insufficient data, graduation rates were imputed with the population of 15-19 year olds in each of the metro area\u2019s counties, provided by the U.S Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey, in order to account for counties where a cohort was not provided. Metro areas that did not have at least 80% of their graduating population represented in the county data were excluded from consideration.\n\nThe estimate of the median income for adults with less than a high school diploma and the percentage of people with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree come from the 2018 U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey. The 2018 unemployment rate comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.
