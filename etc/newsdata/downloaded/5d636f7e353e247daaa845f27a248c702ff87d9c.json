Maybe you can take some time out & think about how difficult MY life has been since abandoning me with two little babies, two farms to take care of & pulling you\u2019re [sic] income out of this family, but not taking any of the bills with you. \u201cHow difficult it\u2019s been for your two kids since you\u2019re not around\u2026\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Scorned woman lights Facebook on fire revealing she paid out her $7.5K divorce settlement in loose change.", "authors": ["Stephanie Pagones"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/divorce-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
