However, in his admission, Mulvaney said Trump wanted Ukraine to investigate the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer server over an unfounded conspiracy theory.\n\nRecalling a conversation he had with Trump before leaving office, Kelly said he urged the president not to hire someone who would tell him the truth.\n\n\u201cI said, whatever you do \u2014 and we were still in the process of trying to find someone to take my place \u2014 I said whatever you do, don\u2019t hire a \u2018yes man,\u2019 someone who won\u2019t tell you the truth \u2014 don\u2019t do that,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cBecause if you do, I believe you will be impeached.\u201d\n\nKelly also said that the current administration doesn\u2019t have a proper system to prevent Trump from being vulnerable to impeachment probes.\n\n\u201cThe system that should be in place, clearly \u2014 the system of advising, bringing in experts in, having these discussions with the president so he can make an informed decision \u2014 that clearly is not in place. And I feel bad that I left,\u201d the New York Times quoted Kelly as saying at the event.\n\nS.V.
