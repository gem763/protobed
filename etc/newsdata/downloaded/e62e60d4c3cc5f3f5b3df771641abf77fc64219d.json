Regarded as the best scrummaging prop in the squad now he has taken his chance as Rob Evans' lack of 'durability' - as Gatland put it when he dropped him in August - let him down.\n\nTomas Francis might have played at the last World Cup, but there was a fair while when Samson Lee - before his Achilles gave him gip - was often preferred.\n\nIt is not unfair to say that Jake Ball would not expect to start at lock if Cory Hill were fit, or if Adam Beard had not lost his appendix on the day Wales flew out to Japan.\n\nJosh Navidi, who was snubbed for four years between caps one and two, and Aaron Wainwright would have been doing very well to be here at all if the planned back-row of Sam Warburton (retired), Ellis Jenkins and Taulupe Faletau (both injured) were available.\n\nIf Rhys Webb had not been cruelly captured by the WRU's updated laws on eligibility if you play abroad - ruling him out after his Toulon move because he did not have 60 caps - would Gareth Davies be the No 9?\n\nCaptain Alun Wyn Jones (L) and hooker Ken Owens (R) have been staples in Gatland's side\n\nJosh Adams has been the find of the last two years - another case of someone thrown in and grabbing their chance ahead of established options - and then you come to Hadleigh Parkes.\n\nThis was a man who in 2014 went on an 'overseas experience' with his then girlfriend, now pregnant wife, Suzy to Europe from New Zealand with a backpack and no designs on a Test career.\n\nBut here he is, barely two years after his debut which came on the day he qualified for Wales back in December 2017, as a key cog in a World Cup quarter-final.\n\nDan Biggar (L) has tied down the starting spot at fly half after Gareth Anscombe's (R) injury\n\n'You do have to pinch yourself a little bit,' says the centre.\n\n'It has been amazing few years. We wanted to travel and we did. It has certainly gone a lot better than I expected!\n\n'There were two options on the table - Bayonne for six months as a medical joker and maybe a little bit longer, or a two a half year gig in west Wales.\n\n'Suzy, my partner, had just qualified as a chartered accountant so it was a bit tough to ask her to go to a French-speaking country where she probably wouldn't be able to work.\n\n'Wales have been very kind to myself and my family.\n\n'To be here, playing in a World Cup quarter-final, against France, so we have a steeped history, well, it's exciting.\n\n'It is massive privilege to be here.\n\nHadleigh Parkes saw a European trip turn into a Wales adventure coming from New Zealand\n\n'December 2, 2017 was when I made my debut - it's only a month or so away (to the anniversary).\n\n'Being able to play for Wales in those two years has been amazing.\n\n'The run we went on, the Six Nations, the Grand Slam, the tour to Argentina and America... I've had some amazing experiences, and it has been a dream.' Parkes watched the 2011 World Cup in the 'Cloud' fanzone in Auckland while tucking into a few pints, and in 2015 he did the same in a Cardiff pub.\n\nHe, like Wyn Jones, Navidi, Adams and Wainwright, has established himself within the last two years.\n\nThat is only a third of the time Wainwright has been playing rugby full stop. Only taking up the game aged 17, having been a promising footballer with Cardiff City who was once coached by Patrick Vieira, now at 22 he starts Wales' biggest Test match for four years.\n\nWyn Jones has shown Gatland his durability that has seen him displace Rob Evans in the team\n\n'I did not think it would go quite this far!' said the flanker who has already been compared to Warburton.\n\n'I started off just playing with my mates in school and it has just carried on from there.' Those days of playing at Whiteheads RFC have been worth it.\n\n'That is where I found my feet in rugby I guess,' Wainwright added.\n\n'I started playing down there, progressed, and got picked up by the Dragons Academy. They put me in Cardiff Metropolitan University for a year and that was massive for my physical development.\n\n'I played Championship rugby at weekends against some big lads down in places like Narberth and Bedlinog.\n\nAaron Wainwright only started playing rugby at 17 years old and was a promising footballer\n\n'It gets prepared you for senior rugby and in BUCS rugby and the English university league that was faster and more skilful.\n\n'It has helped me get to where I am now I guess.' Remarkably he and his fellow opportunists are now playing and performing on the World's biggest stage.\n\nIt is a great testament to them, and to Gatland's flexibility and talent-nurturing skills, that half the Welsh team here could not be named with any conviction as little as three years ago.\n\nJust three more wins at this World Cup and they will be the most lauded Welshmen of all time.\n\nAnd that would truly be remarkable for all sorts of reasons. But then again, fortune favours the brave.", "description": "WILL KELLEHER IN BEPPU: There are the stalwarts of the Warren Gatland era, those with more than 50 caps, who were always likely to be here, with Ken Owens and Alun Wyn Jones involved.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/17/19930492-0-image-a-97_1571502256779.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
