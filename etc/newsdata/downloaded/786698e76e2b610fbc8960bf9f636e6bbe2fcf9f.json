[Former FBI Director] Robert Mueller set it up, [Former CIA Director] John Brennan petitioned Attorney General [Eric] Holder to charge me with five felonies of espionage \u2014 all of it dismissed. Ironically it was Peter Strzok who put the cuffs on me in 2012.\u201d\n\nStrzok was the FBI agent who was fired from the Mueller investigation because of a series of anti-Trump texts that he sent to his girlfriend. (RELATED: Report: Whistleblower Was White House-Seconded CIA Agent)\n\nKiriakou told Fox that the current \u201cso-called whistleblower\u201d doesn\u2019t resemble one. \u201cA whistle-blower is anybody who brings up waste, fraud, abuse, threats to public health or safety, and they do this almost always with a great personal cost attached to it. This so-called whistleblower at the CIA is someone who is acting anonymously \u2026 By all accounts, this is an analyst who is not undercover. You can\u2019t hide this person\u2019s name, identity, just to save him from embarrassment or the trouble of being recognized \u2026or something like that.\u201d\n\nThe CIA whistleblower told Carlson that few in the media defended his actions. \u201cActually only Fox came to my defense \u2026 MSNBC never called me a whistleblower. They called me a \u2018CIA leaker.\u2019 It\u2019s tough being a whistle-blower. Political lines are drawn, and that\u2019s really where these things usually turn.\u201d (RELATED: Trump Calls Whistleblower \u2018Highly Partisan,\u2019 Denies Wrongdoing)\n\nKiriakou said he doubts very much that the current whistleblower will spend any time in prison and cited the fact that he is well represented by a well-connected team of lawyers, one of whom, Kiriakou says, has deep connections to the CIA.", "description": "Former CIA whistleblower John Kiriakou says the current whistleblower who ignited the impeachment inquiry is \u201can anonymous source for Democratic Staff.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/56E5EAAF-899A-4E66-BD03-EC626AF32E69.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
