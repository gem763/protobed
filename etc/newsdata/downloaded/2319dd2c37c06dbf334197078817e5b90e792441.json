(AP) - If Tennessee\u2019s learned anything during a miserable two-week stretch to open the season, it\u2019s that the Volunteers can\u2019t overlook anyone.\n\nSo the winless Vols are taking nothing for granted Saturday as they welcome Football Championship Subdivision program Chattanooga (1-1) to Neyland Stadium before beginning Southeastern Conference competition next week.\n\nTennessee desperately needs a victory after producing its first 0-2 start since 1988, when the Vols lost their first six games before rallying to finish 5-6.\n\n\u201cThe real character, who you are, kind of shows up in these times,\u201d Tennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt said. \u201cI like the people in our program, I\u2019ve said it all along. I like this team and I don\u2019t believe the leadership in our program is going to waver one bit.\u201d\n\nTennessee is facing a coach with connections to the program that started the Volunteers\u2019 torment.\n\nChattanooga coach Rusty Wright spent the last two seasons as an assistant on Shawn Elliott\u2019s staff at Georgia State, which stunned 26-point favorite Tennessee 38-30 in the season opener for both teams.\n\nWright understands what it would take to produce an even bigger upset this week.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to get lucky,\u201d Wright said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to create your own luck. You watch that Georgia State film, Georgia State got lucky four or five times. There\u2019s guys running wide open who don\u2019t get the ball. A back falls down.\u201d\n\nTennessee believes it has made progress since that dreadful performance against Georgia State, even though its record doesn\u2019t reflect it.\n\nAfter being outrushed 213-93 by Georgia State, Tennessee controlled both sides of the line of scrimmage against BYU last week. The Vols lost that game 29-26 in overtime after a defensive breakdown enabled BYU to deliver a 64-yard completion that set up a game-tying field goal with one second left in regulation.\n\nTennessee can\u2019t afford to slip up again this week because it follows the Chattanooga game by facing No. 9 Florida, No. 3 Georgia, Mississippi State and No. 2 Alabama.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s pushing each other up and not just pointing fingers saying it\u2019s one person\u2019s fault or one side of the ball\u2019s fault,\u201d Tennessee receiver Marquez Callaway said. \u201cWe\u2019re all taking ownership.\u201d\n\nHere are some other things to watch Saturday when Tennessee hosts Chattanooga.\n\nSTRUGGLING QUARTERBACKS\n\nTennessee\u2019s Jarrett Guarantano threw just three interceptions and lost two fumbles all of last season, but he\u2019s been less careful with the ball this year.\n\nGuarantano threw an interception and lost a fumble in the fourth quarter of the Georgia State game. He threw an interception early in the third quarter last week that set up a touchdown and helped BYU rally from a 13-3 halftime deficit.\n\nChattanooga\u2019s Nick Tiano has thrown two interceptions and only one touchdown pass this season. He completed only half his pass attempts last week in a 41-20 loss to Jacksonville State.\n\nFEATURED FRESHMEN\n\nChattanooga freshman Ailym Ford is the Mocs\u2019 leading rusher with 177 yards and two touchdowns on 34 carries. Ford may find himself running into Tennessee freshman linebacker Henry To\u2019o To\u2019o, whose 15 tackles put him in a tie for the team lead.\n\nTennessee has its own productive freshman running back in Eric Gray, who has 106 yards rushing and 56 yards receiving. Gray complements junior Ty Chandler, who ran for 154 yards against BYU.\n\nRECEIVERS TO WATCH\n\nTennessee\u2019s Jauan Jennings has 11 catches for 196 yards and three touchdowns. Chattanooga\u2019s Bryce Nunnelly has 14 receptions for 187 yards this year after catching 79 passes for 1,237 yards and seven touchdowns last season.\n\nVOLS SEEKING TURNOVERS\n\nTennessee has committed four turnovers but has only one takeaway so far this season. Pruitt says the turnover margin has made the difference in Tennessee\u2019s first two games.\n\nMOCS\u2019 VETERAN LINE\n\nChattanooga has an experienced offensive line that hasn\u2019t allowed a sack this season. That group faces a Tennessee defense that sacked BYU quarterback Zach Wilson four times and pressured him throughout last week\u2019s game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "If Tennessee's learned anything during a miserable two-week stretch to open the season, it's that the Volunteers can't overlook anyone.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Megargee"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/brigham_young_tennessee_football_02649_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
