The comb was quite long, there was about 10-15kg of honey in there\n\nHe estimated the bees had been building the hive for about two years.\n\nThe homeowners had been unaware of the hive, which was nestled in the ceiling of their lounge room, as the bees had entered through a gap in the side of the property.\n\n'It was fairly quiet in the house, the main sign is bees coming and going from the outside,' Mr Wood said.\n\nMr Wood said the process to remove the bees is done very carefully and specifically as to not hurt them.\n\n'I use a thermal camera to locate the hive and the hot part of the hive, the hot part of the hives is where the queen lives,' he said.\n\nMr Wood said his first priority is to make sure the queen bee is safe and secured.\n\n'I then cut the ceiling to expose the hive and vacuum the bees out,' he said.\n\n'Every hive has a personality, I like to work nice and slowly, slow is best I try not to use smoke, I usually do get a sting or two but you just play the game.'\n\nMr Wood said the process to remove the bees is done very carefully and specifically as to not hurt them (pictured: the hole he had to cut to remove the bees)\n\nMe Wood said that it is quite common to have hives inside homes as they have been struggling to find trees to live in.\n\n'There's not a lot of planting trees and we're cutting down too many. It's a mistake that we keep cutting them down, and there's no natural alternative.'\n\nHe said as the temperature begins to rise, people can expect to see more bees buzzing about.\n\nIn August Mr Wood was called to a similar job in Bracken Ridge, north of Brisbane.", "description": "Brisbane beekeeper Paul Wood was called in to remove 70,000 insects and a massive amount of honeycomb  buried deep inside the\u00a0joists of the property.", "authors": ["Kelsey Wilkie For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/03/20358070-0-image-a-17_1572404498898.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
