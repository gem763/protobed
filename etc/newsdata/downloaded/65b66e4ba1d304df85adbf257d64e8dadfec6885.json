It\u2019s like me in the end; I really wanted it.\u2019\n\nHe said the Wham! star was uncomfortable being gay (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nHe explained: \u2018I had two alternatives: one, to die, and one to live, and I wanted to live. But that\u2019s the difference, if you want it, and poor George didn\u2019t want it.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpening up about the time he found out the Wham! frontman had passed away, Elton spoke of both Sharon and her husband Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s reaction.\n\nThe icon continued: \u2018I remember talking to you the day he died on Christmas Day.\n\n\u2018And I phoned you and I was in Aspen and Ozzy got on the phone and he said, \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to be here.\u201d\n\nGeorge passed away on Christmas Day in 2016 (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018I thought that\u2019s the most succinct apt thing, \u201che didn\u2019t want to be here\u201d.\u2019\n\nTalking about George\u2019s sexuality, Elton added: \u2018He was so uncomfortable in his skin about being gay even though he said he wasn\u2019t.\u2019\n\nThe Freedom hitmaker died on Christmas Day in 2016.\n\nThe coroner confirmed, three months after George\u2019s passing, that there would be no inquest into his death and that the pop star died as a result of dilated cardiomyopathy with myocarditis and fatty liver.\n\nHowever, one of the pop star\u2019s close friends and manager, Andrew Ridgeley, has recently said he still has questions surrounding the tragic passing.\n\nIn his new autobiography, he claimed George \u2018seemed to be in good health at the time and there are conflicting reports surrounding that night that preceded his passing\u2019.\n\nNeed support?
