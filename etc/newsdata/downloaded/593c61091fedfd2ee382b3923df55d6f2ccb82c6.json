You can only doff your cap to him\n\nBrock Osweiler has decided to retire after just seven seasons. He shuts the door on a career we should all envy, unless you\u2019re into all that gladiatorial glory stuff that football touts. Osweiler beat the system: He got into the league, helped win a Super Bowl, got his money and got out, all while maintaining his pristine teeth and long-term health. It\u2019s only fitting he called it quits during Brocktober.\n\nThere was just something about Osweiler. He represented bigger ideals. He inspired heated debates on how teams evaluate talent in the modern age, the role of race in quarterback evaluations, whether height is an important attribute, how teams should allocate precious quarterback dollars and whether late-stage Peyton Manning was any good. And he was also goofy. An entire subreddit devoted to his Brock Lobster nickname persists to this day.\n\nOsweiler was tall and white and ungainly and gangly and mobile. The height alone made him a walking meme. You couldn\u2019t hear the name Osweiler without the numbers six and eight trailing somewhere thereafter. There was an awe factor to his height. It wasn\u2019t just that he felt rain earlier than the average man, it was that every part of him appeared tall, independently: his neck, his legs, his torso, his fingers. Together, they formed the second-tallest quarterback on record.\n\nDecision-makers were charmed by his ability to combine both feet and inches. Whether he threw passes to his teammates more often than the opponents was almost immaterial. Osweiler became the NFL\u2019s poster boy for failing up. He threw just 37 touchdowns to 31 interceptions over the span of his career. He never started a full season. He finished with a 15-15 career record as a starter playing for four different teams. In financial terms, Osweiler finished his career having earned $2.76m per win and $1.1m per touchdown pass. Yet no matter his sparse his output, he would inevitably stumble into another job.\n\nThere have been over-priced, over-hyped quarterbacks who\u2019ve been dubbed stars-in-waiting after a decent run as a backup or playing well within a small sample size. But Osweiler became a perfect distillation of all that appeared wrong with quarterback evaluations in a post-Moneyball, analytics-friendly era. Forget that he was drafted a full round ahead of Russell Wilson; he was given two more opportunities after a third team paid a hefty price for him to kindly go away and never return.\n\nOsweiler represented something to the NFL\u2019s old guard. As old-school offenses were phased out and pace-and-space football worked its way up to the NFL ranks from high school by way of college ball, the types of quarterbacks being produced by the college ranks were different. They were slender and more mobile. They played in less complex systems. They were more efficient and multi-dimensional. Yet there were executives and coaches who clung onto hope that that prototypical guy \u2013 the tall, rhythm-based dropback passer \u2013 was still best. They were stubborn. The old way is the way because that is the way.\n\nHe was drafted in the second round by John Elway to serve as Peyton Manning\u2019s understudy after Elway had wooed the Hall of Famer to shift his operation to Denver. Elway\u2019s plan seemed inspired: ride out the final years of Manning\u2019s career, then transition to the young stud, who would have a Peyton-like knowledge of Peyton\u2019s offense learned behind the scenes.\n\nFor three years Osweiler sat and learned. He got his shot during his fourth season as Manning\u2019s body started to fall apart, the Broncos offense with it. Osweiler did initially add a spark, complementing an all-time defense with just enough pop on behind the ball to guide the team towards the playoffs. He won five of his seven games, completed 61.8% of his passes and tossed 10 touchdowns. A Brockstar was born. The sports-shouting shows had real, actual discussions about whether he would give the Wally Pipp treatment to Peyton. Some drew comparisons between the Tom Brady to Drew Bledsoe changing of the guard that kickstarted the Patriots reign.\n\nThen Manning returned. The Broncos won the whole thing and Osweiler snagged a ring from the bench. Still, he\u2019d shown just enough to be a sought-after free agent. He jilted Denver and headed to Houston, inking a four-year with $72m. With the Texans, he melted into a puddle. It was immediately obvious he wasn\u2019t the star the team hoped; he threw more interceptions than touchdowns in 14 starts.\n\nThe Texans paid the Browns to clean up their mess. They gifted Cleveland a second-round pick, a highly prized asset that eventually became Nick Chubb, one of the top young running backs in the league. The then-tanking Browns wanted to hoard picks. They absorbed Osweiler\u2019s ridiculous cap figure then cut him before he had a chance to survey Ohio for quality rentals. No other player has had to suffer that kind of ignominy.\n\nOsweiler\u2019s career never recovered, if it ever took off in the first place. He spent four more seasons as a swing starter-backup pinballing from team to team: from Denver to Houston to Cleveland back to Denver and on to Miami. His opportunities eventually ran out.\n\nAnd yet Osweiler ultimately gets the last laugh. He will likely don the broadcast circuit for the next three decades or so trading off his time with Manning. There will inevitably be a 30 for 30-style documentary on the 2012 draft class, the most fascinating collection of quarterback stories in a generation. Brock won\u2019t just feature, he\u2019ll be a key line of demarcation. His football career will live on in debates ranging from Colin Kaepernick to efficient team building to whether you should put someone on the field goal unit just because they\u2019re 6ft 7in, whether they can jump or not.\n\nRodger Sherman (@rodger) Here's Brock Osweiler's sad FG block attempt on the Pats' game-winning field goal in 2013: https://t.co/099AOsSRtt pic.twitter.com/UacQWirwL1\n\n\u201cI have my health.
