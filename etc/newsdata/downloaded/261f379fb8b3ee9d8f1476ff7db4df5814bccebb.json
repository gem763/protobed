Palihapitiya is chairman of the combined company.\n\nBranson is racing against competitors including Blue Origin, the private space company founded by Amazon.com Inc chief Jeff Bezos, and SpaceX, created by Tesla Inc founder Elon Musk, to launch tourists into space.\n\nHundreds of people from 60 countries, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio and pop star Justin Bieber, have paid or put down deposits to fly on one of Virgin's suborbital flights.\n\nSome of Virgin Galactic's ticket holders have been waiting more than 14 years for their trips. A 90-minute flight, which allows passengers to experience a few minutes of weightlessness, costs about a quarter of a million dollars.\n\nVirgin's current reservations represent about $80m in total collected deposits and $120m of potential revenue.\n\nThe company has attracted a $20m in investment from the Boeing Company to commercialise space.
