Investing.com \u2013 Apple (NASDAQ: ) is once again the world's most value company, ahead of Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), as shares rose Monday. Apple (NASDAQ: ), up 0.14%, had a market capitalization of $1.069 trillion, overtaking Microsoft's market cap of $1.068 trillion. Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) was up 0.15%. Apple (NASDAQ: ) was the world's most valuable company until the fourth-quarter 2018 slump knocked its stock price down 30% amid worries about slumping sales of its iPhone, by far its biggest revenue source. The shares are up 50% this year, thanks to big gains in the first and third quarters and a 5.7% gain so far this month. The gains have been fueled by the positive reception of its newest iPhone models and strong results from other products, including its Apple (NASDAQ: ) store. It's also planning to start a streaming service. Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) is up nearly 38% this year, building on the success of its cloud-computing offerings and related back-office software, its Surface family of notebooks and tablets and the popularity of its Office programs.\n\nNewsBreak: Apple Is Once Again World's Most Valuable Company", "description": "NewsBreak: Apple Is Once Again World's Most Valuable Company", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA5I13Q_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
