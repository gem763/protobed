The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.00% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average have traded within shouting distance of a records, even if the ascent thus far appears to be tentative.\n\nRead: A \u2018Fed put\u2019 on the stock market could expire worthless due to these \u2018recession errors\u2019\n\nEasy-money policies tend to be a boon for corporations and individuals because it translates to lower borrowing costs and greater risk taking by investors but that doesn\u2019t always mean that the stock market is going to soar in the aftermath of rate cuts, particularly ones that the Fed boss has implied are so-called mid-cycle adjustments and that illustrate a divided central bank. The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee voted 7-3 in favor of the cut, with two members dissenting in favor of holding pat and one member calling for a larger, half-point cut.\n\nHere\u2019s how S&P 500 index SPX, +0.00% has usually performed during the past periods in which the Fed has implemented a pair of rate cuts.\n\nOn average, the S&P 500 has climbed 2.88% from the first rate cut to the last, during a two-cut period, Dow Jones Market Data show. When the cuts are successive \u2014 in other words, coming in back-to-back meetings \u2014 the average return is 1.28%.\n\nOne month later after, a pair of rate cuts, the S&P 500 tends to be up 1.56% higher on average and 1.74% during successive cuts. The market has climbed in three of the past five periods in which the Fed cut rates twice (see table below).\n\nSource: Dow Jones Market Data\n\nSo, how does the market perform if there are more than two rates cuts? Not grand. On average, the market tends to decline 2.14%, with the market tumbling 41.18% during the 10 rate cuts between Sept. 18, 2007 and the end of the cycle on Dec. 16, 2008, the data show (see table below).\n\nSource: Dow Jones Market Data\n\nSteven G. DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies, said not all rate cuts are created equal. Notably, this current series of interest-rate reductions have been billed by the Fed and others as \u201cinsurance cuts,\u201d intended to dampen the harmful effects of a yearlong dispute over import duties between China and the U.S. that has threatened to amplify a global economic slowdown.\n\nIn that way, DeSanctis says: \u201cHistory suggests better performance ahead.\u201d\n\nAlso see: How a \u2018Fed put\u2019 could leave stock market on path for a \u2018late-90s-style meltup\u2019\n\n\u201cAlthough history does not repeat itself, sometimes it does rhyme. Having reviewed performance after a second and even third rate cut, we think performance should be good from here, with small-caps leading. Growth tends to lead early after a second and third cut, but value comes back over the last six months and wins for the full year,\u201d he said in a Thursday note.\n\nAs late-afternoon Thursday, the S&P 500 was up 0.2% at 3,012.74, not far from its July 26 all-time closing high at 3,025.86, the Dow was within striking distance of its July 15 closing high at 27,359.16, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.07% stood about 1.6% from its July 26 closing record.\n\n", "description": "On Thursday, U.S. equity benchmarks were staging a test of fresh all-time highs, a day after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the second time in as...", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR660_cut_09_ZG_20190919141449.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
