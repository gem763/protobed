The Utes are also second in the Pac-12 in rushing offense with 227.5 yards per game.\n\nThough his stats haven\u2019t been as eye-popping, quarterback Tyler Huntley has been efficient in the passing game. Huntley\u2019s 77.1 completion percentage ranks third in the Pac-12. The senior also had an FBS-best 98.6 quarterback rating in his team\u2019s 35-17 victory over Northern Illinois last week.\n\nUtah coach Kyle Whittingham credited Huntley for consistently making intelligent decisions within the framework of first-year offensive coordinator Andy Ludwig\u2019s offense.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a great deal of confidence right now in what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Whittingham said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a great grasp of what Andy\u2019s scheme is all about.\u201d\n\nAll of which will make the task of taking on the Utes on Saturday that much more difficult for Idaho State (1-0).\n\nThe Bengals beat DII opponent Western Colorado 38-13 in their opener. Matt Struck had an impressive debut at quarterback, throwing for 402 yards and four touchdowns. He had the highest single-game passing yardage total for a Bengal quarterback in his debut since Justin Arias racked up 439 yards against Dixie State in 2013.\n\nGetting similar numbers against Utah\u2019s defense will be a challenge.\n\nThe Utes\u2019 Julian Blackmon has come away with an interception in back-to-back weeks. The Utes also completely stifled Northern Illinois\u2019 offense after halftime a week ago, allowing just 69 second-half yards.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all good players,\u201d Idaho State coach Rob Phenicie said. \u201cThey don\u2019t seem to have a weakness.\u201d\n\nHere are other things to know when Utah hosts Idaho State:\n\nSACK ATTACK\n\nBradlee Anae\u2019s fingerprints were all over Utah\u2019s defensive performance against Northern Illinois last week. Anae had three sacks against the Huskies while moving his career total to 20. The senior defensive end needs 10 sacks to overtake Hunter Dimick\u2019s school record of 29.5. Anae has made it a goal to break that record, as well as Nate Orchard\u2019s single-season record of 18.5 sacks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to leave a mark as best as I can here at the University of Utah,\u201d Anae said. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here just to be another player.\u201d\n\nMILESTONE WATCH\n\nZack Moss has a chance to climb the ladder on a pair of all-time rushing lists at Utah on Saturday. Moss needs just 11 carries to move into fifth place in school history for career rushing attempts. He currently has 524. Moss also needs 78 yards to move into second place on Utah\u2019s career rushing yardage list. His 2,918 career rushing yards rank fifth among active FBS players.\n\nEMERGING STAR\n\nTanner Conner put himself on the radar with a career-best performance in Idaho State\u2019s opener. Conner finished with 173 yards and 10 catches against Western Colorado for his first 100-yard receiving game. He totaled 172 receiving yards over his first two seasons with the Bengals.\n\nPAC-12 FUTILITY\n\nIdaho State\u2019s rare wins against FBS opponents have not included victories over Pac-12 teams. The Bengals are 0-15 against the league, most recently falling to California 45-23 last season. Utah owns seven of those wins over Idaho State. The Utes trounced the Bengals 56-14 in the most recent meeting between the two schools in 2014.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "No. 11 Utah is rightly known for its defense but this season the Utes are also making an impression on the other side of the ball.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Coon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/n_illinois_utah_football_74506_c0-226-5400-3374_s1770x1032.jpg?cb5c7867563b2abf97a00a102051a13af94a4d48", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
