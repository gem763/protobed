It\u2019s fueling a deep and pervasive sense of hopelessness and powerlessness among people, in what mental health professionals variously call \u201cclimate anxiety\u201d or \u201cclimate grief\u201d.\n\n\n\nThose directly affected by extreme weather tied to climate change are struggling to cope as their way of is irrevocably altered. Communities affected by events such as major storms, rising sea levels, wildfires and Arctic ice melt often report increased incidences of depression, post-traumatic stress disorders, substance abuse, and interpersonal violence.
