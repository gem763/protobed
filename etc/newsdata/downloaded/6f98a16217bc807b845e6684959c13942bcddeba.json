Sitting in a small room overlooking Luton Town\u2019s training ground, the softly spoken Scouser has talked candidly about the journey that led him here, but one question has made him stop and think. When was the last time he enjoyed a season as a professional footballer?\n\n\u201cPfft,\u201d the 28-year-old says, puffing out his cheeks. He stares into middle distance for a moment, chalking off the years in his mind. \u201cIt\u2019s been that long. It was probably when I was first at Wigan. You\u2019re talking about five, six years ago. I\u2019ve had good spells in between, but I\u2019ve not consistently enjoyed a season for a long time.\u201d\n\nIt probably doesn\u2019t help that, aged 21, McManaman set the bar outrageously high. He was instrumental in Wigan\u2019s miraculous 2013 FA Cup run, before his brilliant man-of-the-match performance in their famous Wembley win over Manchester City. There is a great video of McManaman in the changing rooms afterwards singing \u201cDreams can come true\u201d by Gabrielle into a team-mate\u2019s grainy camera-phone, and even though he\u2019s grinning, you suspect he meant it.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

There\u2019s a lot of luck in football. Looking back I probably should have moved on that summer after the FA Cup, but I was a home lad then. I didn\u2019t want to move. I loved it at Wigan, I had a good relationship with the fans. I suppose I was in my comfort zone and I should have really pushed myself. There was a lot interest but nothing concrete because I didn\u2019t really pursue it.\u201d\n\nMcManaman stayed at Wigan for another 18 months before finally leaving, aged 24, to join West Brom. There he found it difficult adapting to a new style of football under Tony Pulis which was the polar opposite to Roberto Martinez\u2019s Wigan, and he struggled being away from home, too. \u201cI was going back to Liverpool every day \u2013 that was stupid really, but I just couldn\u2019t wait to get home.\u201d\n\nIt took a transfer to Sunderland two summers ago to feel accustomed to living away, but when they were relegated to League One he was sold back to Wigan for a much-heralded homecoming. It never took off: manager Paul Cook had a settled team and saw McManaman as an impact substitute, so much so that 21 of his 22 Championship appearances last season came from the bench. \u201cIt was hard,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew whatever I did, I wasn\u2019t gonna play. Ask the Wigan fans, I actually did well when I came off the bench, I changed a lot of games, but I knew that it wasn\u2019t going to change anything for the next game. I couldn\u2019t see the light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d\n\nIt was times like this when McManaman\u2019s career seemed cursed \u2013 by injury, by his environment, by his comfort zone, perhaps even by his own talents: quick and direct, energetic and fiercely competitive, he has all the traits you would want from an impact player. He has a sense of timing, of knowing when to ghost across a defender\u2019s blind spot, the sort that\u2019s a nightmare for a weary full-backs in the final 20 minutes, and more often than not over the past few years that\u2019s all he\u2019s been trusted with. \u201cIt comes down to having the right manager,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you get seen as an impact sub, how do you fix it unless you start four, five, 10 games? One or two games is not gonna change anything. You need a run, which hopefully I\u2019m gonna get here.\u201d\n\nLuton manager Graeme Jones knew McManaman from his time as Martinez\u2019s assistant at Wigan. The pair met in the summer to discuss a move to the newly promoted Championship club, and McManaman didn\u2019t take long to be convinced. \u201cHe was naming games to me that he\u2019d watched, and said \u2018this manager was playing you in the wrong position\u2019 or \u2018you were doing the wrong thing\u2019. He named the actual game he watched from three or four years ago, so that was very impressive. I remembered them, but you don\u2019t expect anyone else to.\u201d\n\nJones said he was tracking back too much and that he wanted to play him as an out-an-out wide forward. McManaman still working his way to full fitness and a small muscle injury has disrupted his start, but just playing in the opening games has brought back a little joy, and he wants more. \u201cIf I can play a lot of the games that would be massive for me, just to show everyone that I can and I\u2019m not an impact sub. I\u2019m more than that. I need to prove that again, like I did when I was younger.\u201d\n\nThe FA Cup final is little more than a fond memory now. The champagne-sized bottle of Budweiser is stowed at his parents\u2019 house, along with his medal and the man-of-the-match award his girlfriend got framed for his birthday last year. Back when he was singing Gabrielle, Luton couldn\u2019t have seemed a more unlikely destination: they were at a 90-year nadir, entrenched in the Conference. The crumbling Kenilworth Road could kindly be described as an authentic throwback, but the club is looking to the future with a shiny new town-centre stadium in the pipeline, and McManaman is convinced there is everything he needs here to reboot his career.\n\nThe target for Luton this season is simply to survive, and McManaman says that\u2019s all he\u2019s focused on. But does he still harbour loftier ambitions, to return to the Premier League, or to Wembley? \u201cMy girlfriend asked me this not long ago and I suppose I probably should do. But I\u2019ve not enjoyed it for that long, I just want to get back to enjoying it again. Then maybe once I start enjoying it again, that might come.\u201d", "description": "Just for a moment, Callum McManaman is lost for words.
