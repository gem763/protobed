I done something for him - 'You'. It's on his album, isn't it? So when I went to do my one I was told, 'You can't do this, Ed can't do the video. You can't use Ed', basically.\n\n\"He didn't want to stand up to his label - he folded.\n\n\"I knew life wasn't fair, but I didn't know it was this unfair.\n\n\"Everyone thinks I'm mad. I'm not mad. I'm not mad - Ed Sheeran knows what I'm talking about.\"\n\nHe added: \"When Ed wants to do something that's OK. But when we want to do something with Ed? We can't.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Wiley with Dizzee Rascal in 2002, when grime didn't even have a name\n\nThe MC - one of the people who developed and popularised the grime sound in the early 2000s - said Ed's relationship with the grime scene is \"fake as hell\", claiming that \"none\" of Ed Sheeran's fortune has been used to help grime as evidence.\n\nAnd he didn't stop there.\n\n\"Listen, Ed Sheeran - you are a culture vulture and I'm not listening to you anymore. I've listened to you rip off Marvin Gaye, I've listened to you rip off everything. I see you do a tune the other day with Justin Bieber that sounds like a tune from Sting. No-one is not saying nothing about that though. So I'm not listening. I'm finished with these people. I swear to God.\"\n\n'He's just a pagan'\n\nBut Wiley wasn't finished - he turned his attention to Drake instead.\n\n\"J Hus came out of jail right. My man brought him out on stage. That looks good don't it. That looks cool. That looks good init. It looks nang - my man brought out J Hus!\"\n\nDotty, who was at the show at London's O2 when Drake brought out the rapper, said she thought it was an \"amazing\" moment and wondered what Wiley's problem was.\n\nHe said he saw no positives from Drake bringing people out \"as if he is Jesus Christ the saviour\" during his seven sold out nights at the O2.\n\n\"He's not embracing the scene, he's doing it for himself.\n\n\"Mandem who are not from the hood come to places and try and get involved with man from the hood.\n\n\"If you're a good yout and you grew up in the suburbs, and all of a sudden you become a rapper. Do you know what you do? You gravitate to where you never came from - that's what.\"\n\n'It will probably go down in broadcasting history'\n\n1Xtra Breakfast Show host Dotty gives her thoughts.\n\nWhen you're ranting on your socials, there's nobody there to pull you up on things or question you. So it was really interesting to hear Wiley's point of view but then challenge him on some of those views.\n\nWiley is a pioneer of the scene and because of that he holds it very closely to his heart. The grime scene to Wiley is like his child and I think it's difficult for Wiley to see his child grow up and go off into the world.\n\nI couldn't get a word in edgeways, so I just let him go with it, challenging him where he needed to be challenged.\n\nMy relationship with Wiley dates back like 10 years. I think that's the only reason I was able to speak to him - because I've known him for so long and I have a personal relationship with him.\n\nMy takeaway from it is that Wiley is rare in this business - in that he's been in it for a very, very long time and he still speaks his mind.\n\nWhether you believe what he's saying or disagree with what he's saying, it's quite refreshing to have somebody that's not afraid to go on national radio and tell you what they really think.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Drake is the executive producer on season three of Top Boy, out on Friday in the UK\n\nThe MC also had an issue with the Canadian rapper's involvement with Top Boy - the cult UK TV show that was cancelled by Channel 4, and has been brought back with Drake's help.\n\n\"So we need Canadians and Americans to come and help us because we can't do it ourselves? Cool. But my genre's produced over 12 or 13 millionaires.\n\n\"Wiley, Stormzy, Dizzee Rascal - do you know how many millionaires are in London?\"\n\nSo why didn't you bring back Top Boy, asks Dotty? Wiley says he was never asked.\n\n\"The truth is he's just a pagan and he knows it. And if I say it he can't say nothing to me, and that's the truth.\"\n\nWiley said a whole lot more, and the full interview is available on BBC Sounds.\n\nNewsbeat has contacted representatives for Ed Sheeran and Drake.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "It wasn't just Ed in the grime MC's sights - he's got thoughts about Drake too.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4F16/production/_108764202_wileyed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
