In under 10,000 words (there are no hard and fast rules about the \u201cproper\u201d length of a short story, but safe to say any piece of writing more than 10,000 words could not be considered short) an author must successfully create a number of elements, and blend them.\n\nAs in most fiction, the characters should be compelling, the setting should be clear and there should be some conflict or jeopardy. Plot, in the context of short stories is less important than mood, which should dominate clearly and consistently.\n\nOne of the reasons why there is such an appetite for this type of fiction is that they are almost always easily devoured in one sitting. They require intense bursts of attention and reward readers handsomely with plenty to think about.\n\nOur roundup features the best short story collections released so far this year. We were looking for works which felt of the moment but whose shine wouldn\u2019t fade years from now, with writing we felt could be described as modern classics.\n\nWe wanted to give a full flavour of what these collections offer readers when it comes to tone and style, but also in terms of plot. We\u2019ve tried to avoid including story spoilers, but should warn you that in some cases we have been more explicit about how the tale unfolds than in others.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

Caldwell\u2019s introduction serves as a rationale which questions extensively what it means to be Irish, although the entire collection does this, too. The name of volume derives from a phrase by poet and playwright Louis MacNeice, who once wrote of \u201cthe drunkenness of things being various\u201d.\n\nThe first story, about a woman who falls in love with a dead man, is an immediate challenge to what we might think it means to be Irish. Written by Yan Ge, we see Ireland through the eyes of an immigrant, from someone who straddles two worlds and cultures. Each story jolts you far from the previous one. \u201cThe Swimmers\u201d is a queasy, uncomfortable read given that the narrator is the young, naive son of a paedophile who drives young boys to their swimming lessons in a smelly old bus.\n\nSally Rooney\u2019s \u201cColour and Light\u201d tackles isolation, success and power play as two mutually interested parties with their own insecurities fail to act satisfactorily on what is clear flirtation. In \u201cA Partial List of the Saved\u201d, Danielle Mclaughlin writes of a recently divorced man who warns off his elderly father\u2019s girlfriend, only to find out she is leaving him anyway.\n\nLouise O\u2019Neill\u2019s \u201cLegends\u201d tells the toe-curling story of an intelligent but emotionally unsound young woman who has returned from college to her provincial village but finds herself in a degrading situation that only serves to exacerbate her self-destructive tendencies. O\u2019Neill writes about shame so brilliantly, so viscerally, and with such brutality that this story cannot fail to haunt you. This is a full house of brilliance \u2013 not a dud work in sight.\n\nBuy now\n\n\u2018You Know You Want This\u2019, Kristen Roupenian, published by Jonathan Cape: \u00a38.77, Amazon\n\n\u201cCat Person\u201d, the short story which went viral in The New Yorker is what made Roupenian famous \u2013 read by millions of people across the globe when it was published in 2018. But it is the collection \u201cCat Person\u201d belongs to which cements her status as a master of the short story. The work here show she is anything but a one hit wonder. These are creepy, dark, nasty little tales that are brilliantly executed, leaving the reader unmoored somewhere between nervous and totally freaked out.\n\nThe first story \u2013 of a couple who use sex to emotionally torture a vulnerable house guest is shocking, and yet we knew it was coming. She pushes the form of the traditional fairy tale \u2013 writing of a queen who essentially falls in love with herself disguised inside an actual load of old rubbish. Roupenian\u2019s slow, subtle narrative climbs to often unseen horrors. She leaves plenty of things unsaid, asking readers to let their own minds fill in the blanks.\n\n\u201cSardines\u201d, the story of a child\u2019s birthday party turned rogue and lethal in the woods has the feel of Shirley Jackson\u2019s \u201cThe Lottery\u201d, a coldly terrifying tale which, like \u201cCat Person\u201d, was first published in The New Yorker to a deluge of responses from readers.\n\nWe loved reading \u201cCat Person\u201d a second time around \u2013 it\u2019s still excellent, relevant, relatable and the ending still delivers a sucker punch \u2013 but the best thing about this collection is that this story is not the main event. These stories might seem disparate in terms of tone, style, subject matter and even voice \u2013 but when you look closely, you see that they are all telling the story of women in modern life. Women who are by turns angry, imperfect, guilty and repulsive. And it feels so relatable.\n\nBuy now\n\n\u2018Salt Slow\u2019, Julia Armfield, published by Pan Macmillan: \u00a39.99, Waterstones\n\nYou might have already heard great things about this collection \u2013 and we\u2019re here to tell you that they are all true. Yet this is a set of unnerving, creepy and otherworldly stories where you second guess what to take literally. Armfield has the ability to make the surreal feel typical \u2013 her storytelling is so assured that you accept her backdrops and characters \u2013 from a Catholic schoolgirl who morphs into a huge predatory insect and devours a boy to the personification of sleep \u2013 without question.\n\nJust when you think you\u2019ve got the measure of her talents, Armfield reveals another string to her bow, she is also incredibly funny. We laughed out loud at this from \u201cThe Collectables\u201d: \u201cSomeone had once told Miriam that she looked like Princess Anne and this throwaway comment had come, over time, to form the basis of her whole personality. She wore green velvet loafers year round, pinned her hair in the shape of a pumpkin, spoke like her molars were made of glass.\u201d This is such a confident and brilliant work. Armfield has the rare gift of looking like she doesn\u2019t need to try.\n\nBuy now\n\n\u2018Fabulous\u2019, Lucy Hughes-Hallett, published by Fourth Estate: \u00a310.08, Amazon\n\nNever judge a book by its cover, right? And don\u2019t. Because this cover with its hazy rainbow smear and trite title, seems totally incongruous to its contents \u2013 which are clever, unusual and highly original. Especially when you consider that the etymology of \u201cfabulous\u201d is in fact \u201cfable\u201d.\n\nHughes-Hallett has taken characters from ancient mythology, fable and folklore and dragged them kicking and screaming into the here and now. She retells these stories against this modern backdrop.\n\nAt the end of the book is a section in which Hughes-Hallett summarises the fables from which she derived the stories retold in Fabulous. You might find yourself comparing the two tellings of the same tale, noticing how Hughes-Hallett treats certain elements \u2013 how she molds them to suit her new story. This certainly adds another layer of appreciation for what is already excellent writing.\n\nThe standout story is \u201cActaeon\u201d, in which we meet a dazzling but arrogant estate agent whose fall from grace \u2013 and to his death as it turns out \u2013 comes after he is caught peeking at his boss as she showers. His boss is called Diana \u2013 and Diana was, in ancient mythology, a goddess who was stared at as she bathed in the nude by an ill-fated hunter. This is a strange and rather brilliant collection \u2013 and if you knew nothing about fable or myth before, your appetite will be well and truly whet.\n\nBuy now\n\n\u2018The Sun On My Head\u2019 Geovani Martins, published by Faber & Faber: \u00a310.99, Amazon\n\nThese stories are all set in and around the favelas of Rio de Janiero, and are all told from the perspective of boys coming of age there. Race and class are central themes here, although the stories are also of love and family and friendships.\n\nThe first \u2013 \u201cLil Spin\u201d \u2013 is tough, or at least it might feel that way for anyone who likes an easy read. The dialect is colloquial, urban and with an exclusive subtext. This is a language of secrecy \u2013 the verbal code used by the subculture of the streets. The fact that white middle-class western readers don\u2019t find it easy to navigate is the entire point. But you\u2019ll be hooked as you follow a group of youths through a drug hazy afternoon \u2013 all the way to inevitable trouble.\n\nEach story differs in tone and style \u2013 so much so that you wonder if they really have come from the same author. But what binds the tales here is the voice \u2013 with its street-smart bravado, bitter edge and an emotional intelligence that proves compelling. Martins handles masculinity and fragility with equal commitment. In the conflicting imagery of drugs, guns and butterflies, readers are made to appreciate the importance and weight that each object holds within the pages of this slim but substantial volume.\n\nBuy now\n\n\u2018Orange World\u2019 Karen Russell, published by Chatto & Windus: \u00a311.75, Amazon\n\nThe cover of this volume is crammed with praise for Russell\u2019s storytelling capabilities \u2013 and within minutes one can see why. She takes premises that are at the least surreal, at most ridiculous, and weaves compelling, tight and confident prose around them with an awesome vocabulary.\n\nThe first story, \u201cThe Prospectors\u201d, appears at first to be a romp through Depression-struck America, starring two beguiling but sly women with a talent for picking locks, until they happen upon death and danger. In a later story, we meet Cillian who falls in love with an Iron Age body, who has been preserved in peaty bog for some 2,000 years.\n\nThe final tale, \u201cOrange World\u201d, describes a first-time mother\u2019s deal with the devil \u2013 a hairy, panting, toothy oaf of a creature with an insatiable hunger for breastmilk. In between all of the fantastical elements, Russell offers nuggets of humdrum realism in her observations: \u201cUncle Sean was as blandly ugly as a big toenail.\u201d The contrast is just magic. These are longer short stories, you won\u2019t hop and skip through them in 15 minutes apiece. The scope of Russell\u2019s imagine is hard to conceive \u2013 you\u2019ll need to read to believe.\n\nBuy now\n\n\u2018I Will Not Be Erased\u2019 edited by gal-dem, published by Walker Books: \u00a34.99, Amazon\n\nGal-dem, the award-winning online and print magazine created by women and non-binary people of colour, have released this volume in which contributing writers use raw materials from their youth as a tool for giving advice to their younger selves. Although more personal essay than short fiction, these stories \u2013 poignant, thought provoking, sad and funny on topics as varied as sexuality, power and family \u2013 are deserving of the widest possible audience.\n\nStandouts include Sara Jafari who writes a letter to her younger self in \u201cMy Virginity And My Choice\u201d all about the awkward point where dating in Britain bisects traditional Muslim values.\n\nOr Kemi Alemoru\u2019s \u201cI Hate You\u201d where the writer\u2019s teenage relationship with her mother and her sense of self as a black girl in a very white school are brought into sharp focus before the author concedes that her mother had been her ally all along: \u201cLearning to see my mother as a person rather than my \u2018fat head\u2019 oppressor was one of the greatest gifts of my twenties.\u201d This collection might be intended for a young audience, but we think readers of all ages will benefit from the stories told here.\n\nBuy now\n\n\u2018Look How Happy I\u2019m Making You\u2019 Polly Rosenwaike, published by Doubleday: \u00a313.82, Amazon\n\nThese stories, concerned as they are with motherhood \u2013 longing and waiting for motherhood, mothering, being mothered \u2013 are for everyone. The collection opens with the tale of a woman who is trying without success to be a mother when her younger sister, who has never much coveted parenthood, deliberates over whether to go ahead with her unexpected pregnancy.\n\nReaders also join a group of motherless, childless women on Mother\u2019s Day and observe a woman suffer a miscarriage in tandem with a career low. Rosenwaike doesn\u2019t shy away from the nitty gritty. Far from abstract euphemisms, her stories confront the stark, often shocking realities of miscarriage and abortion with brutal detail.\n\nThese are quotidian, universal stories. You won\u2019t find thrilling twists or plots given over to the extraordinary. But what is rare is Rosenwaike\u2019s voice. She captures what it is to be a mother, a would-be mother, an almost mother or a not-mother with such clever perceptiveness making the stories recognisable, familiar and strangely comforting.\n\nBuy now\n\n\u2018Home Remedies\u2019 Xuan Juliana Wang, published by Atlantic Books: \u00a38.99, Amazon\n\nClever and strange, these stories move from America to China and back again, with themes of identity, privilege and race. In the first story \u2013 \u201cMott Street in July\u201d \u2013 readers live with immigrant families in one room apartments in New York\u2019s Chinatown, as Wang compares their fates to that of the carp which were gladly introduced to American waters decades ago \u2013 only to be derided later when they began to dominate.\n\n\u201cDays of Being Mild\u201d is a snapshot into the lives of rich \u201cbei paio\u201d: Beijing-based hipsters with a wavering sense of direction, who don\u2019t want to be anything like their obedient, diligent parents. We especially enjoyed the story from which the collection takes its name \u2013 \u201cHome Remedies For Non-Life-Threatening Ailments\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s experimental in its form \u2013 a list of symptoms including boredom, inappropriate feelings and guilt \u2013 and their remedies, which range from seducing married men to flooding the home of a close family member. These collectively reveal the interior world of a young woman grappling with who she is and where she has come from.\n\nBuy now\n\n\u2018Rock, Paper, Scissors and Other Stories\u2019 Maxim Osipov, published by The New York Review of Books: \u00a310.62, Amazon\n\nChekov fans \u2013 rejoice! Although chances are you\u2019ll probably already know all about Maxim Osipov \u2013 a Russian cardiologist-cum-author who specialises in writing about the lives of provincial folk. But this is the first of Osipov\u2019s collections of stories to be translated into English. Readers are reminded of Chekov repeatedly throughout the collection. Violence, sickness, corruption \u2013 it\u2019s all there, but in the context of the everyday.\n\nThis is summed up nicely in \u201cMoscow-Petrozavodsk\u201d, a queasy train journey populated by a cast of mysterious players who turn out to be worse than they seemed, with the statement \u201cKillers \u2013 they\u2019re just your average people\u201d. In \u201cPolish Friend\u201d, we accompany a violin player through her life (and across Europe) which is chartered by the presence of a mysterious Pole, the unseen object of her affections. Until he shows up and breaks the spell.\n\nThis is subtle, honest and unaffected storytelling where the lives of normal people are picked up and examined closely \u2013 to remarkable effect.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Short story collections\n\nWriting, fiction and storytelling is so subjective and beholden to personal taste that it feels somewhat wrong to offer a verdict as to which is the best of this bunch. What we can say is that if you are looking for variety \u2013 or a range of voices and themes in one book, we\u2019d suggest plumping for Being Various in which all of the stories are truly outstanding pieces of fiction in completely different ways.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
