There, as a 19-year-old private first class during the Battle of the Bulge, the infantryman was credited with almost single-handedly holding back a German attack on the town of Malmedy.\n\nFor his actions \u2014 heralded days later in a New York Times account reporting that he had \u201chelped immobilize three German tanks, wiped out a house full of Nazis, rescued six of his trapped buddies and saved five wounded men\u201d \u2014 Mr. Currey, who attained the rank of sergeant before completing his service, received the Medal of Honor, the military\u2019s highest decoration.

The town of Malmedy became infamous as the site of a massacre by Waffen-SS troops of more than 80 U.S. soldiers who had been forced to surrender at the start of the battle.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNotable deaths in 2019: Ric Ocasek, Valerie Harper, Ross Perot, Toni Morrison, and others we have lost this year share Share Email this link Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn View Photos View Photos Next Image Ginger Baker, the prodigiously talented and volcanically temperamental rock drummer who helped form Cream, rock-and-roll\u2019s first supergroup, and inspired awe and imitation in a generation of drummers, died Oct. 6 at 80. Read the obituary (Mj Kim/AP)\n\nFour days after the massacre, at about 4 a.m. on Dec. 21, 1944, Mr. Currey was in a foxhole when \u201ca German armored column spearheaded by captured American tanks rolled out of the heavy mist,\u201d the Times reported, overpowering an American antitank unit and surrounding Mr. Currey and several other soldiers.\n\nTaking shelter in an abandoned paper factory, the American soldiers discovered a bazooka but no ammunition. Mr. Currey left the building and, while completely exposed to enemy fire, ran to a supply of ammunition across the street to load the bazooka. With another soldier, he shot at a German tank.\n\n\u201cBy what he would later call a miracle, the rocket hit the exact spot where the turret joined the chassis and disabled the vehicle,\u201d reads an account in the book \u201cMedal of Honor: Portraits of Valor Beyond the Call of Duty.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Currey then turned his attention to a German-held stone house, firing with an automatic rifle on three enemy soldiers. \u201cI got all three with one good burst,\u201d he told the Times, \u201cthen, while the other fellows in the factory covered me, I stood up in plain sight and knocked down half a wall of that house with the bazooka.\n\n\u201cWhen I stood up,\u201d he continued, \u201cI saw a number of our guys trapped in a small hole between me and the house. They had been held down there for hours and asked me to help them out.\u201d\n\nIn a desperate effort to rescue them, he obtained grenades, which he used to attack the house and German tanks threatening the Americans. When the grenades ran out, he continued firing on the Germans with machine guns.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cUnder his covering fire the 5 soldiers were able to retire to safety,\u201d reads the citation for his Medal of Honor. \u201cDeprived of tanks and with heavy infantry casualties, the enemy was forced to withdraw. Through his extensive knowledge of weapons and by his heroic and repeated braving of murderous enemy fire, Sgt. Currey was greatly responsible for inflicting heavy losses in men and material on the enemy, for rescuing 5 comrades, 2 of whom were wounded, and for stemming an attack which threatened to flank his battalion\u2019s position.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nReflecting on his actions, he told the Times-Union newspaper of Albany, N.Y., decades later, \u201cIt was just one day of nine months of steady combat.\u201d\n\nFrancis Sherman Currey was born on June 29, 1925, in Loch Sheldrake, N.Y., and grew up with his foster parents in nearby Hurleyville.\n\nAD\n\nAfter joining the Army, he completed Officer Candidate School training, but it was decided, according to \u201cMedal of Honor,\u201d that he was \u201ctoo immature\u201d for a commission, an irony not lost on those who chronicled his deeds at Malmedy.\n\n\u201cWe were all teenagers, the oldest one was maybe twenty-one years old, and I was the one with all the training,\u201d he said in the book \u201c Voices of the Bulge \u201d by Michael Collins and Martin King. \u201cI knew what I was doing, since I had been in training the year before.\u201d\n\nBesides the Medal of Honor, his military decorations included the Silver Star, the Bronze Star Medal and three awards of the Purple Heart.\n\nAD\n\nAfter the war, Mr. Currey worked as a benefits counselor at a veterans hospital in Albany, N.Y., and ran a landscaping business.\n\nAD\n\nSurvivors include his wife of 70 years, the former Wilma French, of Selkirk; three children, Michael Currey and Kathryn Domery, both of Selkirk, and Jonathan Currey of Dudley, Mass.; seven grandchildren; and 12 great-grandchildren.\n\nDecades after the war, Mr. Currey became the first Medal of Honor recipient to be represented as a G.I. Joe action figure. However, he preferred not to seek attention for his recognition. \u201cI got it; that\u2019s all,\u201d he told the Times-Union of Albany in 2013. \u201cI don\u2019t make a big issue out of it.\u201d\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\n\nAD", "description": "He was a 19-year-old private first class when he almost single-handedly held back a German attack on the Belgian town of Malmedy during the Battle of the Bulge.", "authors": ["Emily Langer", "Obituary Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KpBX4-ICS3noJPsgs1sVLPrTSlY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7D3I34HLOQI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
