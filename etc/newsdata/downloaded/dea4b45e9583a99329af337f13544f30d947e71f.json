REUTERS/John Ruwitch More\n\nProtests in Hong Kong began in June after Chief Executive Carrie Lam proposed plans to allow the Chinese government to extradite Hong Kong residents, a move perceived by some in the territory as an extension of repressive tactics deployed in mainland China. After months of protests, some involving millions, Lam withdrew the extradition bill last month.\n\nHuman rights advocates have raised concerns about China for decades, and recently over its reported detention of between 1 million and 2 million members of a Uighur Muslim minority, the country\u2019s tech-equipped surveillance apparatus, and other issues.\n\n\u2018A big mistake\u2019\n\nNot only did Cruz condemn companies that he thinks have actively facilitated the crackdown on protesters in Hong Kong, but also those that have failed to speak out against it.\n\nOn Tuesday, Disney CEO Bob Iger declined to comment on the Hong Kong protests, telling the Wall Street Journal \u201cto take a position that could harm our company in some form would be a big mistake.\u201d\n\nSerwer asked Cruz whether Iger\u2019s comments amounted to capitulation.\n\n\u201cOf course it is,\u201d Cruz says. \u201cI'm all for business pursuing opportunities, but not at the expense of free speech and our fundamental values.\u201d\n\nWhile Cruz has spoken strongly in condemnation of Chinese human rights violations, he has not taken every opportunity to follow through on the criticism. In January, Senator Marco Rubio (FL-R) introduced a bill that would direct U.S. government agencies to provide reports on the Chinese mass detention of Uighurs.\n\nForty-four senators have signed onto the bill, but Cruz is not among them.\n\nMax Zahn is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
