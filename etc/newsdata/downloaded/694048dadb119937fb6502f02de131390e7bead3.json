Considering the intent of the Nazi regime as it consolidated power, Arendt wrote, \u201cTo know the ultimate aims of Hitler\u2019s rule in Germany, it was much wiser to rely on his propaganda speeches and Mein Kampf than on the oratory of the Chancellor of the Third Reich.\u201d\n\nSpotting the real Trump isn\u2019t tricky. It\u2019s a matter of listening to the words he cares about, and not the scaffolding of speechwriting and consequent spin in which they\u2019re contained. Soviet defector Victor Kravchenko wrote in his 1946 memoir, I Choose Freedom, \u201cBehind the ostensible government was a real government,\u201d and the real government of Donald Trump isn\u2019t in the \u201che\u2019s not a politician\u201d excuses from allies or the bleatings of his cable surrogates\u2014an idiot cadre of trout-pout blonde nonentities and pomaded men in shiny suits with tie knots the size of cantaloupes.\n\nNo, the topology and intent of the Trump autocracy is usually best viewed in the asides, not the text\u2026 until now.\n\nWhen Trump reads a speech written to meet the rote demands of the presidency, somewhere in the bowels of the White House speechwriting office, some guy grinds out workmanlike, even uplifting, text. It gets a coating of lube from Kellyanne and the tiny cadre of other adults left in the Presidential Bedlam and then slapped in a Teleprompter.\n\nTrump\u2019s delivery of those obligatory words\u2014the odd cadences of the marginal reader sounding out the big ones, and his flat intonation\u2014is that of a person who wants to check the rhetorical boxes so he can get on with denouncing the enemies of the people. Reading the uplift is his ticket to shoveling the shit.\n\nIn North Carolina on Wednesday, he pulled back the curtain further, daring his audience and his supporters to follow him into a very dark place. Of course, they did. \u201cSend her back\u201d was a feature, not a bug. He was delighted. He was thrilled.\n\nWhen a beet-red Trump, looking like a jowly, sweaty brick strutted onstage in a friendly town in a friendly state, huffed his way to feeding time for the red-meat, red-state crowd, he knew what he wanted. He wanted the glassy-eyed shouts of the mob. He wanted more coverage of his racial firebombing of \u201cthe Squad.\u201d\n\nAnd eager to feel the transgressive thrill of validating and amplifying Trump\u2019s latest racist excesses, the MAGAs waddled in to fill the auditorium. The ladies brought the sequined Trump tank tops and bedazzled hats, and the men tightly fitting MAGA T-shirts over their swag bellies. The flags were American, the vibe 1932 Berlin.\n\nHe knew what would happen when he launched into his prepared remarks about the four members of the Squad. He wanted his five days of stacking the kindling to ignite a racial bonfire, and it did. He knew what the crowd wanted, his feral instincts about their darkest impulses as keen as always.\n\nTrump understands his Deplorables with an almost anthropological eye; he knows they\u2019re not just looking for validation or jobs or a drained Swamp; they\u2019re looking for permission to be as cruel, grotesque, and vicious as he is. He knows they\u2019re addicted now to the way he enables and empowers them to say and do the things they want, regardless of consequence. His brilliant, shitty showmanship is tuned to their Bubba Belt sensibilities; crude, loud, a vulgarian warrior giving them permission to blow up a society leaving them behind.\n\nAnd he\u2019ll always have eager men and women willing to first normalize, then amplify, and then monetize even his most extreme statements and acts. His pet network jumped from the speech to a gouty-looking Tucker Carlson who took to the airwaves of Trump Fernseh-Rundfunk and ran with it. Tucker, already spank-bank fodder for the alt-right incels and white nationalists who love how he vectors Trump supporters into their willing arms, kept up the skeer of demonizing four women of color as traitors in need of purging. Fox loves a good brown enemy, and their coverage of Trump in this particular run has proven it, again.\n\nDemocrats who live under the delusion that issues will deliver them in 2020 are laboring under a campaign-killing false premise. Democrats who think there is a point at which even Trump can be shamed and his behavior corrected need to cut back on the day-drinking. This is a referendum on Trump, and policy arguments will be lost in the static and fury of an apocalyptic campaign ahead.\n\nHe\u2019s telling you exactly what he\u2019s going to do. He\u2019s showing you with every speech, tweet, and policy that this election is about his ethnic animus and stoking the resentful edges of society into President Cartman\u2019s race war.\n\nIt is \u201cthe secret society in plain sight,\u201d the political noumenon in broad daylight. This speech was a dangerous instrument in the hands of a reckless president, and a reading of the text itself is hardly sufficient to highlight its risks to our nation, our politics, and the soul of the country. Trump has once again escaped political accountability because he has an entirely secure political cadre in Washington, a Trumphadi caucus seeking only to be greeted in the afterlife by 72 Tomi Lahrens.\n\nLike all totalitarians, Trump tests the limits of his followers and breaks them.\n\nIn so many stories of abusive relationships that end in tragedy, the escalating arc toward a violent, terrible end starts with the small insults and put-downs, followed by the ugly head games. The victims think they can change the victimizer, that they can bribe him with love, compliance, or obedience. They\u2019re puzzled when that is greeted with screaming and fits of rage. This is the point where the victim still rationalizes the behavior of their abuser. Victim counselors have heard it a million, tragic times; \u201cI deserved it. I made him mad\u201d or \u201cI slipped\u201d or \u201cHe\u2019s under a lot of stress.\u201d Thus it is with today\u2019s GOP.\n\nTrump\u2019s allies in Congress may operate based on fear and opportunism in mixed measures, but by Wednesday, they had transformed their early, silent horror of the overtly racist attacks on the progressive members of the Squad into a rationalization so baroque and elaborate that even for this rectally flexible Republican caucus it was a stretch. His random tweetshark attack was being spun as a genius move of 47-dimensional quantum chess. He was pulling off another one of his President Chaos plays, owning the libtard media, and framing the Squad as the face of the Democratic party. Then came last night.\n\nImagine being a Republican in Congress during last night\u2019s chant. Those are their voters now. Those are the people watching them for the slightest deviation from Trump. They\u2019ll do anything to keep the mob off their backs and their timelines. I\u2019d beg them to stand up, punch him in his blubbery, racist mouth, but they won\u2019t. Even the ones who will still be in office after the end of the second Trump term (which, Democrats, you\u2019re working hard to ensure) won\u2019t hit him. The elected members who spin that they\u2019re going to clean up Trumpism and make it the New Respectable Face of the Populist GOP are fooling themselves. You\u2019re all dead men walking because you\u2019re cowards, dead inside, and dead politically.\n\nTrump\u2019s speech last night wasn\u2019t mere campaign-style rah-rah and hyperbole; it was a moral challenge to America. It was a preview of how the manic energy and boundless amorality of Trump\u2019s growing evil will be the defining characteristic of the 2020 race. Trump\u2019s campaign is based in po-white trash identity politics in a form so pure that Richard Spencer and David Duke are nodding in approval.\n\nHe will always double down, even in failure and most certainly in the face of rebuke. His campaign will tear this country to shreds to save his ass and his ego. He will always drag America deeper into the slimy contents of his grotesque id, smearing the rest of us with its ichor.\n\nAgain, \u201cSend her back\u201d is the new \u201clock her up\u201d but as all mobs do, this one will want more, and the leader will need to up the ante. So, Donald, why not skip right to \u201cFetch the rope\u201d?\n\nIt\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking, anyway.", "description": "He\u2019s pulling back the curtain further, daring his audience and his supporters to follow him into a very dark place.
