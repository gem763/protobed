We explain. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Railing against impeachment at a meeting of his Cabinet, an angry President Donald Trump called Monday for the identification of the government whistleblower who made the first accusations against him.\n\n\u201cDo we have to protect somebody that gave a totally false account of my conversation?\" Trump said at one point. \"I don\u2019t know. You tell me.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats conducting the impeachment inquiry say federal laws are designed to protect the identities of whistleblowers.\n\nThey also said the statements of this particular whistleblower are consistent with a partial transcript of July 25 phone call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 presidential contender, and Biden's son Hunter, who once had business interests in Ukraine.\n\nThe president disagreed, telling reporters Democrats have \"nothing.\"\n\n\"I think they want to impeach me because it's the only way they're going to win,\" he said. \"They've got nothing. All they have is a phone call that is perfect. All they have is a whistleblower who's disappear. Where is he?\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump, center, points to members of his Cabinet while speaking during a Cabinet meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House, Monday, Oct. 21, 2019, in Washington, as Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, left, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, right, listen.

Trump has said he did nothing improper and that there was no \"quid pro quo\" in which he used the aid as leverage to get Ukraine to investigate a political rival.\n\nImpeachment inquiry:Week 5 questions about withholding military aid from Ukraine and diplomat who called policy 'crazy'\n\nShow me evidence: Lindsay Graham doesn't rule out impeachment if inquiry establishes 'quid pro quo'\n\nImpeachment was one of several topics Trump covered in remarks to reporters during a Cabinet meeting.\n\nDuring the session, Trump also:\n\n\u2013 Lambasted top Democrats Rep. Adam Schiff and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., over the impeachment inquiry, saying they are focused on that and ignoring the nation's real problems.\n\n\"These people are trying to destroy the country,\" he said.\n\nHe added, \"the president of the United States should be allowed to run the country and not have to focus on this kind of crap, while at the same time doing a great job on Syria and Turkey.\"\n\n\u2013 Defended one of his foremost critics \u2013 Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard \u2013 against attacks by a more long-term political foe: Hillary Clinton.\n\nClinton is \"accusing everyone of being a Russian agent,\" Trump said. \"These people are sick. There\u2019s something wrong with them.\u201d\n\nWhile not specifically naming Gabbard, Clinton last week referred to the Hawaii congresswoman by saying during a political podcast that \"she's the favorite of the Russians.\" Clinton added that \"they have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\"\n\nPoll: Majority of Americans lacks confidence in Trump when it comes to making Supreme Court picks\n\nIn a series of tweets, Gabbard called Clinton the \"personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long,\" and said she is part of a \"concerted campaign\" to destroy her reputation.\n\n\u2013 Chided Democrats for pushing back against his decision to host the G-7 summit of world leaders at his resort in Doral, Florida. The president on Twitter Saturday reversed his decision to host the summit there, suggesting Camp David could serve as an alternative site.\n\n\"I would have given it for nothing,\" Trump said of Doral to reporters in the Cabinet Room Monday. \"The Democrats went crazy, even though I would have done it free.\"\n\n\u2013 Attacked Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, for criticizing his actions and suggested that Republicans are not as united behind him as Democrats are in seeking to impeach him.\n\nDemocrats are ambitious and stick together, Trump said.\n\n\"They don't have Mitt Romney in their midst,\" he said. \"They don't have people like that. They stick together. You never see them break off.\"\n\nTrump also attacked \"Never Trump\" Republicans who have always attacked him, claiming they are worse than Democrats.\n\n\"The good news is they're dying off fast,\" Trump said. \"They're on artificial respiration.\"\n\nDemocrats denounced Trump's various comments during the 71-minute Cabinet meeting. Ronald Klain, chief of staff for vice presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden, tweeted that it was a \"tirade of lies, deceptions, delusions, and distractions.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/21/impeachment-trump-says-ukraine-whistleblower-should-identified/4053046002/", "description": "Railing against impeachment, President Trump called for the identification of the whistleblower who accused him of improperly pressuring Ukraine.", "authors": ["David Jackson", "Courtney Subramanian", "Michael Collins", "Published P.M.
