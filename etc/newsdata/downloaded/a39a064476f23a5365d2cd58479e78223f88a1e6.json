GM announced today it will invest $150 million at the plant to increase production of the all-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra heavy-duty pickups, which begin shipping to dealers this week.

At Flint, GM builds the heavy-duty 2020 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Crew and regular cab pickups.\n\nThe strike is over: UAW ratifies a new labor contract with GM\n\nAbout 46,000 UAW workers went on a nationwide strike at Sept. 16 and ended the stoppage when members ratified a four-year contract officially on Friday.\n\nThe strike cost GM more than $1 billion, analysts have estimated. While it had stockpiled vehicles in inventory, losing production for six weeks is likely to be a point of pain, analysts said.\n\nThat's why getting pickup production going is crucial. Just days into the strike, GM's other plant that builds its regular-duty pickups, Silao Assembly Plant in Silao, Mexico, was idled because of a parts shortage. Then, GM had to partially idle Ramos Arizpe Vehicle Assembly in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico. There, Chevrolet Blazer SUV production was halted on Oct. 19 because of a parts shortage. It is still building the Chevrolet Equinox SUV.\n\nGM declined to say when its Mexico plants would be running again. The restart at Silao depends on how quickly Grand Rapids Operations can resume building crucial engine components needed for the pickups. GM's Romulus Powertrain plant and Tonawanda Engine Plant in Buffalo, New York, build Blazer engines.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re obviously focused on getting all of our operations back up and running as quickly as we can,\" said GM spokesman Dan Flores.\n\nIn Canada, GM's truck line at its Oshawa plant in Ontario is expected to restart Monday, said a person familiar with GM's plans. That plant builds the outgoing model of the Silverado and Sierra pickups. The Oshawa car line started last week and finished its build-out of the Chevrolet Impala sedan, which is being discontinued when Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly finishes building the Impala at the end of January. Detroit-Hamtramck also builds the Cadillac CT6 sedan. GM has not announced the fate of the CT6 yet.\n\nFollow Jamie L.
