The most famous example is his insistence that he drew the biggest inauguration crowd ever, but his latest fixation is arguably even more pathetic. Though most Americans probably missed Trump\u2019s false claim on Sunday that Alabama was likely to be hit by Hurricane Dorian, he spent the rest of the week highlighting his own embarrassing mistake, touting a map that had clearly been altered with a Sharpie, then repeatedly complaining that the media owes him an apology. By Saturday, following a shameless unsigned statement on Friday from the NOAA supporting Trump\u2019s lie, Trump and his administration had drawn official rebukes from numerous high-profile meteorologists and former government officials.\n\nHere\u2019s a recap of this week\u2019s dumbest saga, which now seems poised to outlast the hurricane itself.\n\nSunday: Trump Needlessly Warns Alabama\n\nOn Sunday morning, Trump included Alabama in a list of states that should be preparing for Hurricane Dorian. Note that he said Alabama would \u201cmost likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated\u201d; days later, he says he merely warned that \u201cone model\u201d showed Alabama \u201cwould have been hit or grazed\u201d \u2014 though the original tweet is still up.\n\nIn addition to Florida - South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated. Looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. Already category 5. BE CAREFUL! GOD BLESS EVERYONE! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 1, 2019\n\nThe National Hurricane Center never issued such a forecast. Meteorologists called Trump out on the error immediately, and the Birmingham branch of the National Weather Service confirmed that the president had his facts mixed up. Still, he continued to repeat the error.\n\n\u201cIt may get a little piece of a great place \u2014 it\u2019s called Alabama, and Alabama could even be in for at least some very strong winds,\u201d Trump said during a FEMA briefing on Sunday. \u201cThis just came up, unfortunately. It\u2019s the size of the storm that we\u2019re talking about. So for Alabama, please be careful also.\u201d\n\nMonday: Trump Lashes Out at Reporter for Fact-checking False Claim\n\nRather than admitting he made a mistake and moving on, Trump insulted ABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl for reporting in a Monday evening broadcast that the National Weather Service had issued a correction, and there was no threat to Alabama.\n\n....when in fact, under certain original scenarios, it was in fact correct that Alabama could have received some \u201churt.\u201d Always good to be prepared! But the Fake News is only interested in demeaning and belittling. Didn\u2019t play my whole sentence or statement. Bad people! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 2, 2019\n\nWednesday: Trump Pulls Out His Sharpie, and a Meme Is Born\n\nIn an Oval Office briefing on Wednesday, Trump took the next step in his casual dismissal of fact. He unveiled \u201cthe original chart\u201d \u2014 an older projection model from the National Hurricane Center \u2014 in which Alabama appeared to have been tacked onto the forecast in Sharpie. \u201cIt was going toward the Gulf, that was what was originally projected,\u201d Trump said. Naturally, he didn\u2019t mention that the weird black bubble was shaped as if to perfectly encompass the Alabama coast, and did not adhere to the form of normal projections.\n\nA White House official told the Washington Post that Trump altered the map himself. \u201cNo one else writes like that on a map with a black Sharpie,\u201d the official said.\n\nShortly after the press conference with the doctored image, Trump tweeted out some evidence to back up his claim: a map from the South Florida Water Management District that was four days old by the time he issued his Sunday warning to Alabama.\n\nThis was the originally projected path of the Hurricane in its early stages. As you can see, almost all models predicted it to go through Florida also hitting Georgia and Alabama. I accept the Fake News apologies! pic.twitter.com/0uCT0Qvyo6 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 4, 2019\n\nApparently Trump did not see the fine print on the map itself, which reads:\n\nNHC Advisories and County Emergency Management Statements supersede this product. This graphic should complement, not replace, NHC discussions. If anything on this graphic causes confusion, ignore the entire product.\n\nNo NHC maps ever projected Dorian to cross into Alabama.\n\nThursday: Trump Offers More Misleading Evidence\n\nBy this point Trump\u2019s Sharpie-doctored map was being widely mocked, and many noted that it\u2019s illegal to present a doctored National Weather Service forecast as the real thing. (The punishment can include a prison sentence of up to 90 days, though Trump certainly won\u2019t face legal consequences.)\n\nNevertheless, Trump insisted in a pair of Thursday morning tweets that Dorian was originally projected to hit Alabama, displaying his bizarre penchant for drawing out embarrassing controversies way longer than necessary.\n\n....Instead it turned North and went up the coast, where it continues now. In the one model through Florida, the Great State of Alabama would have been hit or grazed. In the path it took, no. Read my FULL FEMA statement. What I said was accurate! All Fake News in order to demean! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2019\n\nAbout two hours later \u2014 after he had retweeted some accurate information from the National Weather Service and attacked actress Debra Messing (you know, the normal presidential routine during a hurricane) \u2014 Trump returned to his Alabama obsession.\n\nAlabama was going to be hit or grazed, and then Hurricane Dorian took a different path (up along the East Coast). The Fake News knows this very well. That\u2019s why they\u2019re the Fake News! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2019\n\nHe revisited the matter on Thursday afternoon, posting a map from last week that showed, at best, a 10 percent chance of tropical-storm-force winds hitting Alabama:\n\nJust as I said, Alabama was originally projected to be hit. The Fake News denies it! pic.twitter.com/elJ7ROfm2p \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2019\n\nFinally, Trump had an adviser issue a statement saying Trump\u2019s statement on Sunday was based on forecasts that \u201cincluded the possibility of tropical storm force winds in southeastern Alabama\u201d \u2014 a possibility that lasted through Monday morning.\n\nYou may be surprised to learn the President is not giving this up!! pic.twitter.com/MlYgBPknnv \u2014 Kevin Liptak (@Kevinliptakcnn) September 5, 2019\n\nAs ABC News notes:\n\nA National Hurricane Center map from Monday morning shows a tiny part of southeastern Alabama having a small, 5 to 10% chance of seeing tropical storm-force winds, or winds of 39 mph or greater. Every state up the East Coast had at least the same slight chance \u2014 including New York, Maine and other northeastern states, although Trump never mentioned the slight threat to those.\n\nFriday: Trump Presses NOAA Into Service, Prompting a Hurricane of Backlash\n\nOn Friday morning, Trump complained that the Fake News Media still hasn\u2019t said sorry for its accurate reporting. He also noted that \u201cthis nonsense has never happened to another President\u201d \u2014 though presumably, that has something to do with Trump being the first president to forge a hurricane forecast map.\n\nThe Fake News Media was fixated on the fact that I properly said, at the beginnings of Hurricane Dorian, that in addition to Florida & other states, Alabama may also be grazed or hit. They went Crazy, hoping against hope that I made a mistake (which I didn\u2019t). Check out maps..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2019\n\n....This nonsense has never happened to another President. Four days of corrupt reporting, still without an apology. But there are many things that the Fake News Media has not apologized to me for, like the Witch Hunt, or SpyGate! The LameStream Media and their Democrat..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2019\n\n....partner should start playing it straight. It would be so much better for our Country! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2019\n\nAlso on Friday morning, the ever-opportunistic Trump campaign confirmed that they see the fight as a base-booster by promoting sales of \u201cofficial Donald Trump fine-point markers\u201d to capitalize on the controversy and further troll the media. In the afternoon, Trump\u2019s twitter account shared a video which excerpts a very early CNN forecast about the possible path of the Hurricane, in which Alabama is mentioned as in the hurricane\u2019s possible path.\n\nThen on Friday evening, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a division of the U.S. Department of Commerce, released an unsigned statement rebuking the Birmingham branch of the National Weather Service, which had posted a tweet on Sunday refuting the president\u2019s claim and assuring Alabamians that they were not in danger. The Birmingham office, according to the anonymous NOAA statement, \u201cspoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available.\u201d\n\nThis extremely misleading statement and stunning apparent capitulation prompted outrage from well-respected meteorologists and numerous former leaders at the NOAA, NWS, and National Hurricane Center. All praised the NWS staff at the Birmingham office and most had choice words for whoever was behind the NOAA statement. Some expressed fears that the Trump administration, in service of the president\u2019s vanity, was discrediting government forecasters whose work consistently saves countless American lives.\n\nSaturday: Trump Can\u2019t Resist Blaming the Media for Making Him Defend Himself\n\nPresident Trump made it through most of the day without mentioning Sharpiegate, but then at 4:44 p.m., he claimed on Twitter that he just couldn\u2019t abide the way a single sentence in the New York Times report on the NOAA\u2019s Friday statement had framed his original tweet about Alabama. Indeed, he presented the line \u2014 which was part of section reporting that people in Alabama didn\u2019t seem to much care about the controversy \u2014 as a smoking gun:\n\nThe Failing New York Times stated, in an article written by Obama flunky Peter Baker (who lovingly wrote Obama book),\u201dEven after the President forecast the storm to include Alabama.\u201d THIS IS NOT TRUE. I said, VERY EARLY ON, that it MAY EVEN hit Alabama. A BIG DIFFERENCE..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2019\n\n...FAKE NEWS. I would like very much to stop referring to this ridiculous story, but the LameStream Media just won\u2019t let it alone. They always have to have the last word, even though they know they are defrauding & deceiving the public. The public knows that the Media is corrupt! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2019\n\nSo, when will Trump finally drop this? One senior administration official suggested the media will have to blink first, telling the Post, \u201cas long as it\u2019s in the news, he is not going to drop it.\u201d\n\nAnd as long as he keeps talking about it, it is likely to remain in the news.\n\nThis post has been updated throughout.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
