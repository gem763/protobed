Democrats won the House popular vote by more than eight percentage points. Republicans gained Senate seats mainly in deep Red states where, generally speaking, Republicans ran well behind Mr. Trump\u2019s performance two years earlier.\n\nThis year, Mr. Trump extended his war on immigrants and immigration. Yet the percentage of Americans who say that immigrants strengthen the country and are not a burden has risen from 54 percent after the 2018 election to 65 percent now. This view is held strongly by 52 percent. Only 26 percent agree with the president that immigrants are a burden because they are accused of taking jobs, housing and health care.\n\nAmerican voters will not disappoint us again.", "description": "", "authors": ["Stanley Greenberg", "Nytimes.Com Opinion"], "top_image": ""}
