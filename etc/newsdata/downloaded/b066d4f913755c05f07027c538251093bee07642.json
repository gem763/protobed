You guys, that\u2019s less than a month away, and the same day as the US gets it so we\u2019re not even missing out on anything.\n\nBased on the John Green novel of the same name, Looking For Alaska introduces us to Miles \u201cPudge\u201d Halter (Charlie Plummer) as he enrols in a boarding school to go and \u201cseek a Great Perhaps\u201d \u2013 otherwise known as a deeper perspective on life. There, he meets and falls in love with Alaska Young (Kristine Froseth), and finds a group of loyal friends. But when an unexpected tragedy strikes, Miles and his mates are left to pick up the pieces.\n\nDenny Love, Jay Lee, Landry Bender, Sofia Vassilieva, Uriah Shelton, and Jordan Connor. Ron Cephas Jones (This Is Us) and Timothy Simons (Veep) co-star.\n\nAnd don\u2019t worry, Green served as an executive producer on the show so expect a faithful adaptation.\n\nAll eight episodes of Looking For Alaska will premiere October 19 on Stan.\n\nLOCK IT IN.\n\nThat trailer really is just three minutes of teen angst.\n\nAlso, if you sort of recognise Froseth it\u2019s because she also starred in Netflix\u2019s Sierra Burgess Is A Loser. Plummer is known for the films All the Money in the World and The Clovehitch Killer.\n\nAs for other glorious Stan content, expect RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK (October 4), All American (October 8), and Get Shorty (October 7) to pop up on the streaming service next month too.", "description": "The local legends at Stan have just announced that\u00a0Looking For Alaska,\u00a0the series,\u00a0will premiere in Australia on October 19.", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-24-at-9.38.54-am.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
