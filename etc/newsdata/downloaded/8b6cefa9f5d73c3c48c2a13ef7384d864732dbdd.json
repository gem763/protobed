It does not apply to asylum seekers, refugees or children.\n\nBut it would apply to the spouses and parents of U.S. citizens. That could have an impact on families who are trying to bring their parents to the U.S.\n\nThe proclamation says immigrants will be barred from entering the country unless they are to be covered by health insurance within 30 days of entering or have enough financial resources to pay for any medical costs.\n\nPresident Trump (seen in the White House on Friday) signed a proclamation that would bar immigrants who cannot pay for medical insurance to enter the country\n\nThe measure will be effective Nov. 3.\n\nThe Trump administration is trying to move away from a family-based immigration system and into a merit-based system, and Friday's proclamation is another effort to limit immigrant access to public programs.\n\nThe Trump administration earlier this year made sweeping changes to regulations that would deny green cards to immigrants who use some forms of public assistance.\n\nThe White House also directed officials to recover income-based welfare payments from sponsors, and proposed a rule requiring verification of immigration status for anyone seeking access to public housing benefits.\n\nThe required insurance can be purchased individually or provided by an employer, and it can be short-term coverage or catastrophic.\n\nMedicaid doesn't count. And an immigrant will not be able to obtain a visa if using the Affordable Care Act's subsidies when buying insurance.\n\nThose subsidies are paid for by the federal government.\n\n'While lawful immigrants qualify for ACA subsidies, they'll be stuck in a catch-22 because subsidized coverage does not qualify as insurance under the proclamation,' tweeted Larry Leavitt, executive vice president for health policy at Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care policy think tank.\n\nThe new edict will not affect green card holders already in the United States. Instead, it will apply to would-be immigrants applying for visas from abroad.
