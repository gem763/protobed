That system rested on a belief that democratic capitalism could always be more effectively destabilized from the inside rather than requiring war to cripple it.\n\nBy 1919 Lenin had gained total control of the Bolshevik revolution and was designing the power structure of the future Soviet Union. Although it would take another two years to end a still-raging civil war Lenin had already targeted Western capitalism and, specifically, Britain for a long-term campaign of infiltration and subversion.\n\nThe Russian attack would come in three waves.\n\nThe first was to exploit the deep social unrest in Britain following the end of World War I. The working class had provided the cannon fodder for mindless slaughter, and the survivors were turning against a ruling class that had led the war from behind.\n\nThe second wave would use the cover of developing trade with the British Empire for building an industrial espionage network and exploiting labor unrest.\n\nThe third wave had a far longer and larger ambition \u2013 to recruit young, susceptible, clever and willing British agents who would be carefully nurtured and planted in the upper levels of British intelligence and diplomacy.\n\nLenin\u2019s plan reflected a bedrock view of Western democracy as a soft target that in the end would be brought down by untenable extremes of wealth and poverty. That has endured as an operating principle through Lenin, Stalin and ultimately Putin (who prefers mafia capitalism to democratic capitalism).\n\nGiven that premise, it became essential to understand a target country well enough to identify and exploit the divisions within it. Lenin himself knew his enemy at first hand: he had lived in London and used the reading room of the British Museum to sharpen his ideology.\n\n\u201c The Russians always worked from the bottom up, not the top down. And they understood something that is as salient today as it was in 1919: the quality of the intelligence that flows in is what determines the effectiveness of the work that flows out. \u201d\n\nAs the first attack on Britain began, British socialists declared themselves opposed to Lenin\u2019s \u201cdictatorship of the proletariat\u201d\u2014the Labour Party had no stomach for purges and fanatical oaths of loyalty. But they were conflicted. They opposed efforts by Britain, America and Japan to undermine the Russian revolution\u2014hoping naively that there was a common bond of the mass of people that would reject tyranny.\n\nIt was this ambivalence that the first wave of the Lenin attack set out to manipulate. It was directed by a man who could truly be called Russia\u2019s first mole, Theodore Rothenstein, an \u00e9migr\u00e9 who was already in place in London.\n\nDuring the war Rothenstein had successfully infiltrated British wartime planning by working for MI7, a branch of military intelligence, and passed on a valuable and detailed picture of how that worked to Moscow.\n\nWith the end of the war Rothenstein was directed to actively foment trade union- led strikes in shipyards, coalmines and factories, which he did with some success.\n\nMore bizarrely, Rothenstein funded and cultivated one of the leaders of the suffragette movement, Sylvia Pankhurst, who\u2014swallowing Soviet propaganda whole\u2014launched and ran an outfit called The People\u2019s Russian Information Bureau in the belief that Soviet Russia would turn out to be a utopia for women.\n\nPankhurst was later arrested and served a six-month sentence for publishing \u201cseditious\u201d articles.\n\nSome of the funds Rothenstein used came from selling diamonds \u201cliberated\u201d from the Romanovs. Rothenstein\u2019s wife and daughter helped themselves to diamond-laden jewelry until Rothenstein\u2019s masters in Moscow warned that these displays made them too conspicuous.\n\nIn fact, British intelligence had gathered a thick file on Rothenstein and tracked all his moves. From 1917 onward British code-breakers had read all the traffic between Moscow and London. The Bolsheviks had abandoned Tsarist-era codes for a simpler system that the British had been able to crack with the help of a team of \u00e9migr\u00e9 women.\n\nBefore the war ended British intelligence began sharing information with the Americans, under a treaty that remains in place today. The U.S. Attorney General, A. Mitchell Palmer, directed a new unit, the Bureau of Investigation, to run counterintelligence operations and its most assiduous agent was a young J. Edgar Hoover. Fear of Bolshevik penetration was so great that the Philadelphia Inquirer editorialized: \u201cWe may as well invite Lenin and Trotsky to come here and set up business at once.\u201d\n\nThe second phase of Lenin\u2019s European plan began in 1920 with the arrival of a Soviet trade delegation in London. Winston Churchill, fiercely anti-Bolshevik, was secretary of state for war and air in a coalition government and refused to attend an official reception for the Russians, saying he refused to shake hands \u201cwith a hairy baboon.\u201d\n\nThe head of the delegation promised they would not attempt to interfere in British politics in any way. British intelligence swiftly identified the delegation\u2019s number two as a secret agent and knew that he was working with Rothenstein. When Rothenstein made a trip to Moscow he was refused re-entry to Britain on the advice of British intelligence, and never returned.\n\nLloyd George, the British prime minister, agreed to allow the trade delegation to work in London on the grounds that, with its codes broken, it was turning out to be a priceless source of information on Soviet agents in Britain.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Russia the Cheka, the secret police that had ruthlessly enforced party loyalty on the people and the Red Army, expanded to include counter-intelligence and overseas espionage and morphed into the State Security Committee, Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti\u2014the KGB.\n\nThe third phase of the attack on Britain was, in the longer term, by far the most effective. The British counter-intelligence work that had been so effective in the first two attacks totally failed this time\u2014largely because the moles planted by Moscow in the upper reaches of British intelligence came from the same class as the spycatchers and, unlike Russian agents, were above suspicion.\n\nOf those moles those recruited while at Cambridge University in the early 1930s were the most lethal\u2014the spy ring now known as the Cambridge Five: Donald Maclean, Guy Burgess, Kim Philby, Anthony Blunt and John Cairncross.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the long record of Russian attacks on Western democracies shows how astute they usually were in \u201creading\u201d a country.\n\nFor example, when they attacked Britain they were far shrewder than Hitler, who naively believed that he could keep Britain out of World War II by suborning the British aristocracy and, in the person of the Duke of Windsor, the royal family.\n\nThe Russians always worked from the bottom up, not the top down. And they understood something that is as salient today as it was in 1919: the quality of the intelligence that flows in is what determines the effectiveness of the work that flows out.\n\nIn 2016, when the troll farm in St. Petersburg that went under the name of the Internet Research Agency ran a social media campaign directed at our elections, it was fully informed by a picture of fissures in American society that were ripe for incitement.\n\nA common thread was grievance. Whether expressed openly in the rantings of Breitbart or hidden in the dark margins like 8chan, angry people, many of them white, felt dispossessed and looked for somebody who heard them and would help them avenge their mistreatment\u2014an inciter-in-chief.\n\nWe know that more than two years before the election two Russian women made a three-week reconnaissance tour of battleground states, including Colorado, Michigan and New Mexico. Hundreds of email, PayPal and bank accounts, as well as driver\u2019s licenses, were created under false identities, sometimes using stolen Social Security numbers.\n\nBut the fieldwork that went into the St. Petersburg operation must have been far deeper and wider than that to achieve the sophistication of the social media attack.\n\nThe most openly blatant Kremlin offensive was the hacking of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s emails. That was driven in part by Putin\u2019s personal loathing of Hillary Clinton. In the bigger picture, however, as we can now see, the most corrosive and lasting damage was achieved by stimulating extreme factions on the right like the white supremacists who chanted \u201cthe Jews will not replace us\u201d at Charlottesville (some of whom, according to Trump, were \u201cgood people.\u201d).\n\nLittle was done to protect against the attacks. In response, the Obama administration chose unilateral disarmament. In 2015 the State Department aborted the launch of a special unit that had been designed to counter a Russian disinformation campaign. A beta website was ready but State Department officials closed it down.\n\nIn a New York Times op-ed last week week Susan Rice, Obama\u2019s national security adviser from 2013 to 2017, wrote, \u201cOur domestic fault lines remain our greatest national security vulnerability.\u201d It\u2019s a pity that apparently she didn\u2019t realize that in 2015.\n\nPresident Obama may have told Putin to his face to \u201ccut it out\u201d but Putin was by then fully committed to a course of action that in the measured words of the Mueller Report waged \u201ca social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and disparaged candidate Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nPutin was taking a gamble. There was no way of his knowing that Trump would win by a margin of 77,000 votes spread between three states. The Kremlin isn\u2019t that omnipotent.\n\nBut once Trump was in the White House he became Putin\u2019s useful idiot beyond the Kremlin\u2019s wildest dreams. With the help of Rep. Devin Nunes, Republican head of the House intelligence committee, he orchestrated a direct assault on the body that best understood the Russian attacks, the FBI.\n\nNunes released his now infamous four-page memo alleging an FBI conspiracy against Trump, specifically citing the counter-intelligence division, the very people who were in the front line of the defenses against Russia.\n\nTwo of those targeted, Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe and the head of the counter-espionage division, Peter Strzok, have now both filed suits alleging that their dismissals were retaliation for their pressing on with the Russian investigation.\n\nIn the Republican playbook (and Trump\u2019s rhetoric) the real internal danger to America was not Russia but an overmighty counter-intelligence force.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been the steadfast backstop for this travesty. Earlier, in 2016, he blocked a proposal by Vice President Joe Biden to issue a bipartisan statement condemning Russian interference in the election. Since then he has worked hard to earn the soubriquet of \u201cMoscow Mitch\u201d coined by Joe Scarborough.\n\nThree months after McConnell made sure that sanctions on some Kremlin-linked oligarchs were lifted it transpired that one of those oligarchs, Oleg Deripaska, was instrumental in ponying up a $200 million investment in a new aluminum plant in McConnell\u2019s home state, Kentucky. McConnell claims that when\u2014despite the objections of 11 Republicans\u2014he got the sanctions lifted he had no knowledge of the impending deal. But you can be sure that the Kremlin knows enough about McConnell\u2019s power to know the value of pumping money into Kentucky.\n\nI have written before that McConnell behaves like the apparatchiks of the Soviet system\u2014\u201ca man not of grand plans, but of a hundred carefully executed details.\u201d In his hands the legislative process is operated strictly as a party apparatus, not a broad deliberative instrument of democracy.\n\nBy operating like this and in his response to the Russian offensive McConnell has become Putin\u2019s second useful idiot after Trump.", "description": "Two Vladimirs \u2013 Lenin and Putin \u2013 have given a master class in how to incite violence and chaos in Western democracies.
