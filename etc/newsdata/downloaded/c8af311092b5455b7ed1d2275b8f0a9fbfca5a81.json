(Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nThe hospital had run dry of painkillers and antibiotics, leaving Neiro Vargas moaning in agony. The 43-year-old security guard had been brought in with a gunshot to the neck. On the seventh day, his heart gave out.\n\nBut in Maracaibo, the indignities of life no longer end at death.\n\nAn economic free fall more severe than the Great Depression has crippled this onetime oil boomtown, and those who have stayed are bracing for worse under painful new U.S. sanctions. Venezuela\u2019s second-largest city \u2014 and its industrial engine \u2014 is now the epicenter of the socialist nation\u2019s societal meltdown.\n\nThe collapse of civilization here is perhaps most evident at death.\n\n\n\nJulianmi Reyes, 14, center left, is comforted by friends and relatives during the wake for her 8-day-old daughter Jurianmi in Maracaibo on Tuesday. The family fled to Colombia but ended up working brutal hours and spending nights in the streets. She and her boyfriend returned to Venezuela. None of the sonograms revealed that her daughter would be born with her intestines outside of her body. When the family went to the morgue, there were 20 dead babies there. The trauma continued when they had to spend their entire savings, the equivalent of $20, to pay for medical care and burying their child. The death certificate took days to arrive, and their daughter\u2019s body began to decompose in the family,s living room, where the wake was held.

So doctors dispatched his body to \u201cthe basement.\u201d\n\nThe un-air-conditioned morgue.\n\nEven when the power flickers on, none of the morgue\u2019s eight freezers work.

(Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nAs temperatures in this tropical city soared above 90, Vargas\u2019s corpse spent three days on the morgue floor, while his wife, Rossangelys, borrowed money to cover a makeshift coffin and transport to their home. In the family\u2019s living room, in a lawless part of town pocked with abandoned homes, the family held a grim wake. The narrow, black casket lay across two metal stands. Mourners averted eyes from the deceased\u2019s infested face. Rossangelys tried, and failed, to control the smell by filling gaps in the coffin\u2019s wood with caulking.\n\nThey could afford no burial plot. So they dug up the bones of Vargas\u2019s long-dead brother in a local cemetery strewn with broken caskets desecrated by grave robbers.\n\nRossangelys wept by her husband\u2019s resting place. The expelled coffin of her husband\u2019s brother lay in ruins nearby.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just feeling so much rage,\u201d she said. \u201cSo much rage for what we have to go through now in this city, in this country.\n\n\u201cIf a family member dies, we can\u2019t even bury him with dignity.\n\n\u201cHow can this be our reality?\u201d\n\n[During secret Venezuela talks, Maduro offered new elections.

(Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nFor a century, Maracaibo\u2019s fortunes have risen and fallen with oil\n\nMaracaibo, the \u201cBeloved Land of the Sun,\u201d was a city of firsts. The first Venezuelan town lit by electricity. The first to open a cinema. In 1914, Venezuelan Oil Concessions struck crude on the eastern shore of Lake Maracaibo, the petroleum-rich Caribbean estuary that laps at the banks of the city\u2019s jagged skyline.\n\nOil would change everything.\n\nA regional port bloomed into a metropolis of 2.6 million. By 1950, Zulia state \u2014 with Maracaibo as it capital \u2014 accounted for more than half of Venezuela\u2019s GDP. Fueled by wealthy donors, its cultural life thrived. Maracaibo boasted three symphony orchestras and the continent\u2019s largest museum of contemporary art.\n\nBut the depression that began here in 2013 has accelerated into a meltdown, the product of falling oil prices, failed socialist policies, mismanagement and corruption. In 2008, when prices and production were high, Maracaibo crude was generating an estimated $138 million a day. Output has collapsed to roughly $8.5 million.\n\nBy some estimates, as many as 700,000 residents \u2014 nearly a third of the metropolitan population \u2014 have abandoned the area in three years, joining the larger exodus of hungry migrants fleeing Venezuela.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s national power grid is failing, and its oil production collapsing. A country blessed with the world\u2019s largest proven petroleum reserves is suffering severe shortages of gasoline.\n\nThe government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, bankrupt and weakened, has sought to protect the capital, Caracas, from the worst of the crisis. In a trade-off, the government has let Maracaibo fall.\n\n[As Venezuela\u2019s crisis deepens, the most vulnerable are joining the exodus]\n\n\n\nA food kiosk sits empty on a once-busy street.

(Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nSince January, electricity here has been rationed to no more than 12 hours a day \u2014 when there\u2019s any power at all. Lines for gasoline stretch more than a mile; waits last up to 2 days. The queue at the pump on University Street one recent afternoon measured 86 cars. In one street market, a desperate university professor was trying to sell his possessions \u2014 T-shirts, jeans, a lamp \u2014 for food.\n\nAt the sprawling Zulia Museum of Contemporary Art, bathroom pipes and sinks have been stolen, as have printers, computers, audio equipment and a truck. Phone cables were also taken \u2014 making landline calls nearly impossible.\n\nThe museum\u2019s main hall has been shuttered, its leaking roof leaving pools of stagnant water. Amid a budget crunch, the staff has dropped from 150 employees to 14 \u2014 and half of those are unpaid interns. A dozen exotic palms have died out front because the museum\u2019s gardener emigrated.\n\n\n\nEmpty frames line a wall of the Museum of Contemporary Art; the paintings have been stolen.

It is so hard to see it crumble.\u201d\n\nMost traffic lights across town are dark \u2014 for want of electricity, but also spare parts. That\u2019s less of a hazard than it might be, because with the flight of so many people, there are far fewer cars, and almost no city buses.\n\nSome neighborhoods are effectively ghost towns. Maracaibo\u2019s six newspapers have closed.\n\nIn March, desperate looters ransacked more than 500 businesses \u2014 supermarkets, electronic stores, hotels. Many never reopened. The Zulia state chamber of commerce says 30,000 business have closed in 10 years. Hundreds more are shuttering every week.\n\n\u201cMaracaibo was a city of lights, a city of nightlife, a thriving city blessed by the Caribbean sun,\u201d said Eveling Trejo de Rosales, Maracaibo\u2019s former mayor. \u201cNow, we are a dead city. A zombie state. And those of us left here are dead men walking.\u201d\n\n[Trump signs executive order freezing Venezuelan assets, ramping up pressure on Maduro]\n\n\n\nA man passes the contaminated shoreline of Lake Maracaibo.

The 31-year-old fisherman pointed to the rusting husks of oil drills that were built to draw crude from the lake bed.\n\n\u201cThis is the graveyard of the wells,\u201d he said.\n\nThis Connecticut-sized body of water was once Venezuela\u2019s economic lifeline. Now it\u2019s an environmental disaster. The vast majority of the thousands of oil wells that pepper the lake stand broken and useless. Raw crude and natural gas bubble to the surface. The spray of water from Moreno\u2019s motorboat stains clothes black.\n\nHe surveyed the lake.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s destroyed.\u201d\n\n[Venezuela accuses U.S., Israel in alleged coup plot with assassinations and kidnappings]\n\nThe Venezuelan oil industry was built on Zulia\u2019s light crude. The center shifted two decades ago to the thicker oil of the Orinoco Belt farther south, but Lake Maracaibo remained vital to the national economy.\n\nIts decline is one of chapters. In the early 2000s, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the late father of Venezuela\u2019s socialist state, broke the unions at the state oil company, PDVSA. Trained engineers, rig workers and managers were replaced with political appointees. They ran the company into the ground.\n\nIn 2008, when global oil prices crashed, Chavez nationalized firms that supplied, maintained and provided transportation to the lake\u2019s drills.\n\nAs the government under Maduro sank deeper into its financial hole, repairs slipped, then virtually stopped.\n\nMaduro claimed victory last year in an election widely viewed as fraudulent. The United States has backed Venezuela\u2019s opposition in its efforts to oust Maduro and hold new elections.\n\nThe United States was the largest buyer of Venezuelan crude. In January, the Trump administration prohibited U.S. companies from purchasing the oil.\n\nFor an industry already nearing a breaking point, it was like pouring hot water on third-degree burns.\n\nZulia produced 1.55 million barrels a day in 2001, according to Caracas Capital Markets, a Miami-based firm that focuses on the Venezuelan oil industry. By 2018, production had fallen to 250,000 barrels. Five thousand wells were operational in the lake in 2002. Today, union workers say, fewer than 400 are functioning.\n\n[Maduro\u2019s ex-spy chief lands in U.S. armed with allegations against Venezuelan government]\n\n\n\nA fisherman has a smoke after work on the lake.

(Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Trump administration this month broadened the embargo, blocking all property and assets of the government and its officials, and prohibiting any transactions with them, the central bank or the state oil company.\n\nJaime Acosta worked for a private contractor to PDVSA that operated six oil perforators. The company shut down two months ago because the state oil company wasn\u2019t paying the contract.\n\n\u201cI would agree with the sanctions if they end up helping us,\u201d said Acosta, 62. \u201cBut to be honest, at this point, the sanctions are only making it worse.\u201d\n\nWithout his wage to live on, he said, his wife and children have left for Colombia to find work.\n\n\u201cIn Zulia, us oil workers were the ones who drove the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cNow our families are broken.\u201d\n\n[Guaid\u00f3 says opposition overestimated military support for uprising]\n\n\n\nAn apartment block in Maracaibo.

Hyperinflation has put all but the most basic foodstuffs and medicines out of reach, leaving those who remain thin, hungry and sick.

He was one block from his front door.\n\n\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Vargas\u2019s wife, Rossangelys Olivares, said. \u201cIt simply doesn\u2019t care about us.\u201d\n\n[Inside the secret plot to turn senior Venezuelan officials against Maduro]\n\n\n\nPeople board a dilapidated bus at La Curva, an outdoor marketplace in Maracaibo.

The power shortages, and the worsening access to running water, aren\u2019t just inconveniences \u2014 they\u2019re potentially deadly hazards.\n\nParents, unable to wash their children with water and soap, are struggling to control an outbreak of scabies. This year alone, 16 people in the neighborhood have died, community activists say, including the elderly and children with illnesses caused or worsened by the lack of clean water, unreliable power and the unrelenting heat.\n\nThree blocks from Vargas\u2019s home, neighbors watched one recent afternoon as a small group of people carried the body of 11-year Tiany Chacin into her home in a coffin cobbled together from old pieces of furniture.\n\nA stomach parasite had reached her brain. Before she died, her mother said, the girl was vomiting worms.\n\nThis year, her family has had almost no access to potable water, said her mother, Yulimar Chacin, 33. They were left to drink from a stagnant drain. Since cooking gas is scarce and expensive, Chacin said, she could not always afford to boil it.\n\n\u201cWe had no other way, no other way to get water,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s darkness here,\u201d the rail-thin woman said between sobs. \u201cWe are alone.\u201d\n\n[How a plot filled with intrigue and betrayal failed to oust Venezuela\u2019s president]\n\n\n\nPeople escape the heat and humidity in the polluted waters of Lake Maracaibo.
