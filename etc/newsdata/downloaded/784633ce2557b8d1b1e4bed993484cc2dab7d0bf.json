More than 130 people in total were kicked off board \u2013 including several children.\n\n\u201cThey originally said you can come with a police record and without a visa and now they're taking that back,\u201d one woman onboard told Miami\u2019s WSVN 7 News. \u201cThat's really ridiculous. That's awful.\u201d\n\nRenard Oliver, a father forced off the ferry, held back tears as he said: \u201cI have to take my baby off. At the last minute like this, is kind of disappointing. It's hurtful watching my daughters cry.\u201d\n\nBut suggestion that the US Customs and Border Protection had ordered the ship to remove people without visas was flatly denied by officials \u2013 who suggested the boat company, Balearia, had made a \u201cbusiness decision\u201d not to allow such people to sail.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note,\u201d an official told WSVN 7 News, \u201cif those folks had stayed on the boat and arrived, we would have processed them, vetted them and worked without our laws and protocols and done what we had to do to facilitate them. I think it was a business decision by Balearia to remove them. They were not ordered off the boat by any US government agency.\u201d\n\nAsked if they would have been allowed in the country, the official said: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nIt was pointed out that other ships had already landed in Florida \u2013 including a boat with 1,000 people on board on Friday and one with 1,500 on Saturday \u2013 where arrivals had not needed visas.\n\nHurricane Dorian has killed at least 46 people after striking the Bahamas last Sunday as Category 5 storm with winds topping a record-breaking 185mph.\n\nIt is estimated some 76,000 people are now in immediate danger of disease and starvation, while the some 45 per cent of homes on the country\u2019s Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama have been either severely damaged or destroyed. Surveyors put the total cost of the catastrophe at \u00a35.6 billion.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent Minds\n\nAerial photos show miles of flattened and flooded communities.
