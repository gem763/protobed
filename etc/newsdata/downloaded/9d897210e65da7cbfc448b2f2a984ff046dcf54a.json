REUTERS/Tiksa Negeri\n\nADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethio Telecom has appointed international consulting firm KPMG to evaluate its assets, and an advisor on the privatisation process will be appointed soon, a senior finance ministry official said on Thursday.\n\nPrime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office last year and announced a series of major economic and political reforms. He pledged to open the largely state-run economy to private investment, and is moving most quickly in the telecoms sector.\n\nState Minister of Finance Eyob Tekalign Tolina said the government had also issued an expression of interest for a transaction advisor to help it issue licences for other operators who would enter the telecoms sector.\n\nThe government said in July it will award two telecoms licences to multinational mobile companies, in the first detailed announcement of the government\u2019s plans for opening one of the world\u2019s last major closed telecom markets.\n\nThe government will also offer a minority stake in Ethio Telecom, the monopoly operator, and foreign firms will be invited to bid.\n\nEyob said it was too early to say what percentage of the state-run telecom will be sold off.\n\nEthiopia\u2019s telecoms industry is considered the big prize in a push to liberalise the country\u2019s economy because of its huge protected market serving a population of around 100 million.\n\nOfficials have told Reuters that this is because the government believes that the sector will boost growth in other parts of the economy.", "description": "Ethio Telecom has appointed international consulting firm KPMG to evaluate its assets, and an advisor on the privatisation process will be appointed soon, a senior finance ministry official said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Giulia Paravicini", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437042722&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9311C-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
