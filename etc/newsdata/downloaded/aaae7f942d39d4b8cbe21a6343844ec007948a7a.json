These Text Messages Are Just the Latest Proof", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has repeatedly dodged questions about his involvement in the phone call between President Trump and Ukraine\u2019s leader that prompted the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nBut he\u2019s never quite denied it, and it turns out there\u2019s a reason for that: Pompeo and his department are up to their eyeballs in Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal.\n\nNot only was Pompeo himself on the call, high-level State Department officials had spent months working out how to get Ukraine to formally announce investigations that might prove politically helpful to Trump, according to new text messages released by House investigators Friday.\n\nThe texts paint a damning picture of State Department officials attempting to swap a meeting with the president for politically-helpful investigations. And according to one top diplomat, Pompeo was read in all along.\n\nHere Are 7 Crimes Trump Might Have Committed in This Ukraine Scandal\n\n\n\nThat pushes Pompeo to the center of Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal, underscoring just how far his department went to support Trump\u2019s push to undermine his 2020 rivals. And it raises fresh questions about the independence of yet another major government institution at a time when top officials appear increasingly preoccupied with Trump\u2019s personal whims.\n\n\u201cPompeo has defined his role as being more of a political counselor to the president than a traditional diplomat,\u201d said Jeremy Suri, an expert on diplomatic history at the University of Texas in Austin. \u201cNow, we\u2019re seeing that blow up in his face.\u201d\n\n\u2018NIGHTMARE SCENARIO\u2019\n\nThe messages released on Friday show three top U.S. diplomats actively discussing how to nudge Ukraine into announcing politically advantageous investigations. They even dangled a meeting with Trump in the White House before the Ukrainian president as a possible reward for his help.\n\nAnd they did this while showing varying degrees of awareness of just how improper it would be to drag Ukraine into meddling with the U.S. election.\n\n\u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and the meeting [in the White House] are conditioned on investigations?\u201d the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, texted the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland on September 1.\n\nSondland wrote back: \u201cCall me.\u201d\n\nTaylor went on to argue that the U.S. shouldn\u2019t link the investigations to U.S. aid to Ukraine, which was temporarily held by the Trump administration during the discussions about investigations.\n\n\u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor wrote on September 9. That would be a \u201cnightmare scenario,\u201d he wrote.\n\nRudy and the Gang: Your Guide to the Cast of Trump's Ukraine Scandal\n\nDemocrats have demanded to know whether Trump withheld congressionally approved aid to Ukraine as a means to pressure Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenksy into digging up dirt on a political rival, a key question in the impeachment inquiry now threatening to consume Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nBut Zelensky also desperately wanted an Oval Office meeting with Trump as a symbolic gesture of American support to strengthen his hand against Russia, according to experts on Ukrainian politics.\n\n\u201cZelensky was hoping for a summit with Trump from the moment he was elected president,\u201d said Alyona Getmanchuk, a Ukrainian political analyst and Director at the New Europe Center think tank in Kyiv.\n\nThe texts show the American diplomats dangling that meeting while seeking a Ukrainian promise to launch investigations.\n\n\u201cHeard from White House \u2013 assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / \u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington,\u201d U.S. special envoy for Ukraine, Kurt Volker, wrote to Ukrainian presidential advisor Andrey Yermak on July 25, the very day Trump pressed the Ukrainian president to \u201clook into\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\nVolker testified under oath to Congress on Thursday that he was in regular contact with Pompeo while these conversations were going on.\n\nOn Sept 22, the day Pompeo first publicly dismissed the idea of his involvement in the Ukraine situation, Volker says he got a call from Pompeo.\n\nPompeo told Volker that Trump\u2019s lawyer, Giuliani, wanted the State Department to confirm Volker had arranged a meeting between Giuliani and Yermak.\n\n\u201cI told the Secretary that the State Department Spokesperson had already confirmed this, in a statement given to the press,\u201d Volker testified. \u201cSecretary Pompeo asked me to call Mr. Giuliani back, tell him this, and share a copy of that statement. I did so.\u201d\n\n\u2018I WAS ON THE CALL\u2019\n\nThe Ukraine scandal threatens to tarnish Pompeo\u2019s image as one of Trump\u2019s most capable lieutenants \u2014 a man who somehow managed to navigate Trump\u2019s erratic demands and tweet-storms even while other high-ranking officials around him dropped like flies.\n\nNot only has Pompeo allowed his department to be drawn directly into the president\u2019s Ukrainian imbroglio, he also failed failed to protect one of his own diplomats, U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, from being fired earlier this spring, in yet another key moment Democrats will pursue in their impeachment inquiry.\n\nYovanovitch was pushed out at the urging of Trump\u2019s friends outside the administration, including Giuliani, who complained the diplomat was undermining his efforts in Kyiv.\n\nThe Ukraine affair looks likely to leave a lasting stain on Pompeo\u2019s legacy, said Robert Deitz, who held top roles in the CIA and NSA during the George W. Bush administration.\n\n\u201cIn the past, you looked at secretaries of state with admiration, and a sense that you were dealing with a distinguished figure who had the country\u2019s interest in mind and would never, never sully his office,\u201d Deitz said. \u201cAnybody who touches Trump inevitably ends up sullying himself.\u201d\n\nCover: President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo walk off after a news conference at the InterContinental Barclay New York hotel during the United Nations General Assembly, Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2019, in New York.
