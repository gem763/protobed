Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s (D-Texas), who is also running for president, to strip churches or other religious entities of their tax-exempt status if they decline to perform same-sex marriages.\n\n\u201cElizabeth will stand shoulder to shoulder with the LGBTQ+ community\u201d to help stamp out \u201cfear of discrimination and violence,\u201d Warren campaign spokeswoman Saloni Sharma told The Associated Press Monday when asked about O\u2019Rourke\u2019s plan.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cReligious institutions in America have long been free to determine their own beliefs and practices, and she does not think we should require them to conduct same-sex marriages in order to maintain their tax-exempt status,\u201d Sharma added.\n\nThe Warren campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Hill.\n\nO\u2019Rourke raised eyebrows last week when he said he thought that religious institutions that refuse to perform same-sex marriages should lose their tax-exempt status.\n\n\u201cThere can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break, for anyone, or any institution, any organization in America that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us,\u201d he said. \u201cAs president, we're going to make that a priority and we are going to stop those who are infringing upon the human rights of our fellow Americans.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke has faced bipartisan criticism over the remarks, with some saying his plan would threaten religious freedom.

But the idea that you\u2019re going to strip churches of their tax exempt status if they haven\u2019t found their way towards blessing same-sex marriage, I\u2019m not sure [O'Rourke] understood the implications of what he was saying,\u201d Buttigieg said Sunday.\n\n\u201cThat means going to war not only with churches, but I would think with mosques and a lot of organizations that may not have the same view of various religious principles that I do. But also because of the separation of church and state are acknowledged as nonprofits in this country,\u201d he added.\n\nSen.
