One said: \u2018We all believe in rehabilitation of offenders but this is going to be a key role in the run-up to the Election.\n\n\u2018It is a mistake to give it someone who has a conviction for fraud.\u2019\n\nTory MP Andrew Percy said the appointment of the convicted fraudster (pictured left with Jeremy Corbyn) demonstrates 'the depths to which the once great Labour Party has plunged under the extreme Left-wing leadership of Corbyn'\n\nParty workers also protested that Ms Thompson will take on many of the general secretary\u2019s duties as Ms Formby has been having treatment for breast cancer.\n\nMs Thompson, hailed by the Communist Morning Star newspaper for being at the heart of Mr Corbyn\u2019s 2015 leadership bid, was found guilty in 2006 of 19 counts under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act, and one count of false accounting under the 1968 Theft Act. She was sentenced to 100 hours of community service.\n\nPierce (pictured) added how the appointment 'is something you couldn't make up' while a Labour party source defended Corbyn by saying Thompson's conviction was more than 10 years old\n\nThere were raised eyebrows when, two years ago, Mr Corbyn recruited her to work in his parliamentary office. But that turned to anger last night when Labour MPs learned of her latest role. One said: \u2018I really think that Corbyn\u2019s inner circle just don\u2019t care how this looks.\u2019\n\nTory MP Andrew Percy said: \u2018Labour putting a convicted fraudster in charge of one of their most senior offices is something you couldn\u2019t make up. It demonstrates the depths to which the once great Labour Party has plunged under the extreme Left-wing leadership of Corbyn.\u2019\n\nA Labour Party spokesman said: \u2018We don\u2019t comment on staffing matters.\u2019 But party sources defended the appointment, saying Ms Thompson\u2019s conviction was more than ten years old. A Corbyn ally added: \u2018This looks like another pathetic attempt to attack the party leader and it\u2019s extremely unfair on Ms Thompson.\u2019", "description": "Convicted fraudster Marsha-Jane Thompson is appointed acting head of party general secretary Jennie Formby's office.
