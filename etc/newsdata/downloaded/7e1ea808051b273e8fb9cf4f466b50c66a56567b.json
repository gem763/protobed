(Photo: Charles Sykes, Charles Sykes/Invision/AP)\n\nIt's been about four months since Adam Levine left \"The Voice.\" What has the Maroon 5 frontman been up to since then? He works as a stay-at-home dad.\n\nLevine stopped by \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" on Monday where he shared that he's been spending a lot more time with his new family.\n\n\"Just to be able to stop in this moment to spend time with my new young family and just have the greatest time ever,\" the father of two told Ellen. \"Now I\u2019m just, like, a stay-at-home dad. I just stay home and do very little. It\u2019s great.\"\n\nLevine shares two girls with his wife, Behati Prinsloo: Dusty, 3, and Gio, 1.\n\nEllen noted that her guest is a very \"hands-on\" father because he's always out with his kids.\n\nThe former coach on \"The Voice\" said he loves spending more time with his daughters, even though he does miss the show.\n\n\"I\u2019m obsessed with them. I know that\u2019s a good thing, because they\u2019re my children \u2026 that\u2019s why I don\u2019t do much,\" he said. \"I genuinely adore them in a way that I never knew I could adore any little person.\"\n\nLast week, fellow \"Voice\" coach Blake Shelton said he missed his friend Levine.\n\n\"I\u2019m having, like \u2026 What is it when the person gets separated from their kidnapper? I\u2019m having Stockholm syndrome,\" Shelton said Tuesday during the fourth night of blind auditions.\n\nBut the country crooner doesn't have to miss Levine's disses and sabotaging too much, because Kelly Clarkson stepped in and kept the heat on.\n\n\"I have to fill this seat properly,\" Clarkson said, referring to Levine's old chair. \"I feel like Adam\u2019s going to definitely make fun of me if I don\u2019t go in on Blake. I guess I\u2019ll do it.\"\n\nLevine's wife credited him with helping her get through postpartum depression.\n\nOver the summer, Prinsloo joined model Kate Upton's #sharestrong social media campaign encouraging empowerment and positivity and shared a rare photo of her and her kids.\n\n\"Here\u2019s to the sleepless nights, bleeding nipples, crying, laughing, the highest of highs and lowest of lows and everything in between,\" Prinsloo wrote on Instagram alongside a picture of herself holding her two daughters.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/07/adam-levine-goes-the-voice-stay-home-dad-adores-kids/3900118002/", "description": "Adam Levine left \"The Voice\" months ago, but he's been keeping busy with the two daughters he shares with Behati Prinsloo. \"I genuinely adore them.\"", "authors": ["Rasha Ali", "Published P.M.
