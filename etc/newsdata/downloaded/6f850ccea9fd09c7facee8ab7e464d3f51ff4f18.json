It's the same in Brazil and they will be torn apart in England\" after Brexit,\" he warned.\n\n\"When you are 85 years old and you have children and grandchildren, we will leave them nothing if we do not vote those people out of office in Brazil and in London and in Washington.\n\n- 'Ruination of the world' -\n\n\"They are ensuring the ruination of the world\", something that \"we have all contributed to\", Sutherland added.\n\nJagger plays an art collector in a stylish thriller where it \"is never clear who is telling truth\".\n\n\"This movie is about fake(ness) and truth speaks to some of that, so it is part of this modern dialogue,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"We are going through a very strange time. You know you are living in it but you don't know what is going to happen at the end.\"\n\nThe Venice film festival ends on Saturday, with Roman Polanski's controversy-hit Dreyfus Affair story \"An Officer and a Spy\" already bagging the top prize from international critics.\n\nThey picked out director Theo Court's \"White on White\", about the genocide of native people in Patagonia, for their sidebar prize.\n\nThe last two winners of Venice's Golden Lion top prize -- \"Roma\" and the \"Shape of Water\" -- have gone on to win best picture at the Oscars.", "description": "Rock legend Mick Jagger attacked US President Donald Trump for his rudeness and lies Saturday and for \"tearing apart\" environment controls when America should be setting the standard for the world.
