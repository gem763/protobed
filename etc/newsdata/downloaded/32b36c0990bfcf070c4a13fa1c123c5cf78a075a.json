To take charge and protect comes naturally to this person, who steps forth to oblige whenever the need arises \u2013 sometimes even without being asked.\n\nThe presence of such a family member or colleague lulls others into a sense of security; the result is that they fail to develop their own strengths. The most common example of this is parents. When Kalpana went to the park to collect daughter Thea, she was taken aback at the sight of a woman shouting at a group of eight-year-olds, upbraiding them for calling her son an \u201cidiot.\u201d The woman then strictly warned the frightened group to not exclude her son from activities. As expected, soon as the woman\u2019s back was turned, the children all steered clear of this hapless boy, who stood isolated! The mother had antagonized the playgroup against her child and weakened him by letting him believe that he did not need to fight his own battles.\n\nWe are all guilty of having done the same for our children. Rare is the parent who has the heart to deny his child help and to send her back to face the music. It is definitely the more difficult of the two options, but the preferred one, if we wish to train our children to be strong and independent. The same goes for other members of our families. Of course the stronger one can always step in and help, but taking the time out to help strengthen them and make them self-sufficient is a kinder and more generous thing to do.\n\nAs we grow older and our parents grow old and decline, especially if one parent survives the other, we tend to mollycoddle our parent and take over all tasks and decisions. But do we take the time to help strengthen them and build their confidence once again, rather than build dependencies? Is it not kinder to encourage them to be self-sufficient and resilient so long as they know you are available for them whenever needed? This way you encourage their sense of self-worth and value by developing inter-dependency rather than codependency.\n\nAt office, rather than taking over the work of less competent colleagues or stepping forth to take responsibility for others\u2019 faults, encourage people to step up to their work and to own up mistakes. This way we help them improve and become better professionals. Mutual dependencies always make for stronger and more meaningful relationships, rather than one-way needs. People who are dependent on others lose their sense of self and well-being. Codependency leads to people losing their core sense of self, growth and autonomy.\n\nMost will consider this harsh. We are conditioned to believe that the kinder and more loving thing to do is to manage and protect. Yes, that ensures we are loved and valued. If we are strong, we want to use our strength to help those we love and cherish. But perhaps we got it a bit wrong? To help another cannot mean to take over their tasks and responsibilities, their ability to lead an independent existence and be self-reliant! It means to use our strength to help them build their own.\n\nLove is not always kind and supportive. Sometimes you need to throw someone into the water in order to teach him or her how to swim. In order to encourage self-reliance and resilience, you will often have to stand on the sidelines and watch your loved ones take a few knocks. Strength does not mean that you never fall; it just means that you pick yourself up again. It does not mean you do not break; strong people just mend themselves once again.\n\nDo not be the strength of your loved ones; help strengthen them instead.\n\nRespond to vinita.nangia@timesgroup.com", "description": "Rather than be the strength of your loved ones, why not try to strengthen them?
