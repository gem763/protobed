Again,\u201d she dryly tweeted \u2014 clearly referencing Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe president asked a foreign power to help him win an election.\n\n\n\nAgain.https://t.co/EjkE84oCCF \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 20, 2019\n\nClinton attached a clip of Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani\u2019s meltdown in a CNN interview Thursday when he said that \u201cof course\u201d he called on Ukrainian officials recently to investigate Biden, after initially denying it.\n\nClinton\u2019s attack was one of several in the wake of a Wall Street Journal article published Friday which reported that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cabout eight times\u201d in a July phone call to work with Giuliani on an investigation of the former vice president\u2019s actions as well as those of his son, Hunter.\n\nGiuliani has claimed that Biden worked when he was vice president to shield a Ukrainian energy company linked to Hunter from a corruption probe. A Ukrainian official said earlier this year there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by either Biden.\n\nTrump\u2019s request for a Ukrainian investigation into the Bidens is part of a secret complaint filed against the president by a whistleblower in the intelligence community, The New York Times reported Friday.\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t denied pressing Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. He has described the call with Zelensky as \u201cbeautiful,\u201d and said it \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter what I discussed.\u201d\n\nThe possibility of a president leveraging the power of the U.S. government on a foreign country to probe a political rival to help his reelection has begun to trigger calls for impeachment.\n\nFormer Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren appeared to be the first of the Democratic presidential contenders to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment over the matter on Friday. Like Clinton, both O\u2019Rourke and Warren referred to Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nIn 2016, President Trump asked Russia to interfere in our elections. In 2020, he's asking Ukraine to do the same.\n\n\n\nIf no one is above the law, then we have no choice but to impeach this president.\n\n\n\nWhen will Congress have the courage to act? https://t.co/mHjkKSC3AK \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 20, 2019\n\nThis story is stunning and should be shaking Washington right now\u2014Donald Trump's moral vandalism disqualifies him from being president. As I've said before, it's time for impeachment proceedings. https://t.co/DSiv1kjxz1 \u2014 Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) September 20, 2019\n\nDonald Trump is a criminal.\n\n\n\nHe must be impeached immediately.https://t.co/1CZYWxuCc1 \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) September 20, 2019\n\nAfter the Mueller report, Congress had a duty to begin impeachment. By failing to act, Congress is complicit in Trump\u2019s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections. Do your constitutional duty and impeach the president. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 20, 2019\n\nRep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.) said Trump should be impeached if he is blocking the whistleblower complaint from being released to congressional investigators.\n\nThis may be a lawless President, but this isn\u2019t a lawless land. Listening to & protecting whistleblowers isn\u2019t just the right thing to do, it\u2019s the legal thing to do. If Trump is obstructing this complaint, we can add it to the articles of impeachment. \u2014 Rep. Joe Kennedy III (@RepJoeKennedy) September 20, 2019\n\nRichard Painter, who served as chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, tweeted: \u201cImpeach NOW.\u201d\n\nEverything Nixon did during Watergate pales in comparison to Trump using the power of the Presidency to pressure a foreign leader who needs U.S. Aid to investigate a political opponent.\n\n\n\nThe House has no choice.\n\n\n\nThey have to begin impeachment proceedings https://t.co/QJYnJ8jNix \u2014 Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) September 20, 2019", "description": "Beto O'Rourke, Cory Booker, Julian Castro and Elizabeth Warren have all called for Trump to be impeached if he asked for Ukraine's help.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d85506f2300003100d09f67.jpeg?cache=s1kbrbervn&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
