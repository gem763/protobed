An enlarged Chinese middle class has become a lucrative market for the U.S. travel industry. Close to 3 million Chinese tourists visited the U.S. last year. And they spent liberally: An estimated average of $6,700 per person per trip - exceeding the average spending of international tourists by more than 50%_according to the US Travel Association.\n\nConcerns among U.S. tourism agencies have grown as Beijing has warned that Chinese travelers to the United States may face harassment. Compounding the problem is increased difficulty in obtaining U.S. visas.\n\nThe number of visitors from China dropped nearly 4% in the first half of this year after a nearly 6% drop in 2018. More broadly, the U.S. share of the global travel market has slipped in the past year, and travel and hospitality groups blame the trade conflicts and intensified competition from rival countries. To close the gap, they\u2019ve urged the government to extend funding for the U.S. national tourism marketing agency and to work more closely with overseas trade fairs and tour groups.\n\nAt the same time, tourism marketing agencies for states and cities are hedging their bets by intensifying their outreach to countries other than China. Utah and Los Angeles, among others, are trying to expand their presence in nations like India, whose large and youthful middle class is seen as a potentially rich source of tourist dollars.\n\nYet there is no easy way to replace a drop in Chinese tourism. Some U.S. tourism agencies say they worry that Chinese travelers feel unwelcome in the country under the Trump administration. Warnings from Beijing about traveling to the U.S. have likely reinforced that view.\n\n\u201cWith the trade war, with some of the travel warnings, with some of our visa challenges that we\u2019ve had, we\u2019ve seen a little bit of a dip in Chinese visitors,\u201d said Theresa Belpulsi, a senior official at Destination DC, the city\u2019s tourism marketing office.\n\nTourism is one of the few industries in which the U.S. has enjoyed a substantial advantage over China. In 2018, Chinese tourists traveling to the U.S. spent $30 billion more than American tourists visiting China did. Yet that competitive edge may be shrinking.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is just losing market share,\u201d said Adam Sacks, president of consulting company Tourism Economics. \u201cSomething\u2019s made the U.S. uncompetitive, and I would target the trade war as one of the reasons.\u201d\n\nLarry Yu, a professor of hospitality management at George Washington University, warns that once impressions of an unwelcome environment take hold, they\u2019re hard to erase.\n\n\u201cThe trade war creates a kind of environment in China that makes people think twice,\u201d Yu said. \u201cEven though we know that Chinese demand is high, the current environment makes people substitute the U.S. for another place.\u201d\n\nBeijing has issued two warnings to would-be visitors to the United States - one about gun violence, the other about harassment by U.S. law enforcement.\n\nVisa approvals for Chinese visitors have meanwhile become more difficult. The rejection rate for Chinese tourist visa applications to the U.S. reached 17% in the 2018 fiscal year from a low of 8.5% in 2013.\n\nSome tourism companies are feeling squeezed. DFS Hawaii, which operates duty-free stores in Hawaiian airports, plans to shed a quarter of its workforce and has pointed to a drop-off in tourists from China and elsewhere in Asia as a reason. As of August, Chinese tourist visits to Hawaii are down 27% this year.\n\n\u201cThere is no foreseeable indication this will be reversed in the near term,\u201d said Tim DeLessio of the DFS Group, parent company of DFS Hawaii.\n\nSacks of Tourism Economics says he holds out hope that local travel marketing agencies can reverse the trend. The District of Columbia, for one, says its outreach to China has intensified. Destination DC\u2019s latest initiative - hotel discounts for the Lunar New Year early in 2020, with events and performances tailored for Chinese tourists - builds on a sister-city partnership with Beijing.\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s social media expansion to three new Chinese apps marks its latest effort to draw more Chinese tourists. Ads the city created and hosted on two popular Chinese apps, WeChat and Weibo, drove 12 million people to a contest promoting the city\u2019s landmarks, according to the San Francisco Travel Association.\n\nArizona leveraged social media and Ctrip, a Chinese travel website, to urge visitors to check out the state\u2019s outdoor and wellness activities during the Golden Week holiday period this month.\n\nAt a gathering of industry CEOs in September, leading travel brands urged the government to stem the eroding U.S. share of the global market by guaranteeing future funding for Brand USA, a tourism marketing agency. Entry fees paid by international travelers entering the United States fund that agency. But its dedicated funding expires next year. If it does, tourism from China and other countries could drop, travel industry officials warn, and American jobs might be put at risk.\n\n\u201cWithout Brand USA, we would be in an even worse situation vis-a-vis our international competitors,\u201d said Heather McCrory, CEO of Accor, a leading hotel group.\n\nEven New York City, which enjoyed a surge in tourism this year thanks in part to the new Hudson Yards development and World Pride Day, has grown concerned about attracting Chinese visitors.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t control the market conditions,\u201d said Christopher Heywood of NYC & Company, the city\u2019s official tourism marketing agency. \u201cThe geopolitics comes into play.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, some U.S. competitors may gain an edge. The European Travel Commission, which says Europe welcomed 14 million Chinese last year, has joined with its Chinese counterparts at travel shows and partnered with Chinese celebrities to share videos and social media posts involving Europe.\n\nAmerican tourism agencies say they\u2019re seeking other potential sources of visitors in India and elsewhere. But Indian tourists are still less accustomed to traveling in the United States.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of interest,\u201d said Jamie Foley of the Los Angeles Tourism and Convention Board. \u201cBut that comes with the understanding that India is very different from China.\u201d\n\nLeft with little choice, the U.S. travel industry is redoubling its efforts to engage with Chinese tourists while waiting out the trade war.\n\n\u201cThe trade war\u2019s an important subject, but it\u2019s seen as a temporary setback,\u201d said Sage Brennan, co-founder of the consulting firm China Luxury Advisors. \u201cOver the next 20 to 30 years, China is going to continue to impact and shape the tourism market.\u201d\n\nMindful of that likelihood, David O\u2019Donnell of the Greater Boston Convention and Visitors Bureau, said that city has built a pipeline of projects to try to drive tourism from China. Boston is working with China\u2019s Hainan Airlines to showcase the city and with Boston\u2019s airports to develop additional routes to China. It\u2019s also seeking partnerships with China Union Pay and Ctrip, the Chinese travel website.\n\n\u201cAre we concerned that the trade war may impact the travel trade?\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u2018Of course. Are we frustrated by new and more restrictive visa policies? Absolutely. But we know that Boston will always be very appealing to the China market. We are in to stay.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Washington, D.C., has dangled hotel discounts tied to the Chinese Lunar New Year.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bani Sapra"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
