Dried persimmons there are covered in white powder because of the glucose and fructose that dry on their skin.\n\nSangju consists of a vast plain, while the peaks of Mt. Sokri block the damp wind from blowing in from the west. The cold and arid air then results in high temperature fluctuations and creates ideal conditions for drying persimmons.\n\nThe region is home to some 572,000 persimmon trees, and they contain around 30 percent less juice than other varieties elsewhere, making them ideal for drying.\n\nLast year, some 4,000 persimmon orchards in Sangju accounted for 60 percent (11,256 tons worth W300 billion) of total output in Korea (US$1=W1,194).", "description": "Why Sangju's Dried Persimmons Are a National Asset", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/09/14/2019091400079_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
