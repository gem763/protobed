The next step will be \u201cintense negotiations between the companies and the committee about what will be produced,\u201d he said.\n\nThe House committee isn\u2019t subpoenaing the records, though it has the authority to do so\u2014a fact that gives lawmakers a stick they can use in negotiations over access.\n\nCommittee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said the requests will aid an investigation, begun on June 3, into \u201cgrowing evidence that a handful of corporations have come to capture an outsized share of online commerce and communications.\u201d\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Do you feel the big tech companies wield too much power? If so, what needs to change? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cThis information is key in helping determine whether anticompetitive behavior is occurring,\u201d said Rep. Doug Collins (R., Ga.), the panel\u2019s top Republican. The letters were also signed by Reps. David Cicilline (D., R.I.) and Jim Sensenbrenner (R., Wis.), the two senior members of the panel\u2019s subcommittee on antitrust issues.\n\nThe companies didn\u2019t comment Friday. All four firms have previously said they provide significant benefits to consumers and face significant competition. They have expressed willingness to work with authorities.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe congressional probe adds to scrutiny of the tech giants, which already face a broad antitrust review by the Justice Department that could lead to formal investigations. The department has asked Google for information about previous antitrust probes.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission, the other top U.S. antitrust enforcer, has opened an investigation of Facebook, with an early focus on its key acquisitions, and is privately questioning third-party sellers who use Amazon\u2019s marketplace. FTC Chair Joseph Simons declined to comment Friday on the House letters.\n\nState attorneys general from both parties recently launched probes of Google, with an early focus on its advertising business, and Facebook. Authorities in other countries are also investigating. Officials have said they would work together on the overlapping probes, although the extent of that cooperation isn\u2019t known.\n\nU.S. sanctions against the companies, if they come at all, are likely to be years away and imposed by federal or state enforcers rather than Congress. Lawmakers can find facts and change laws, but not bring enforcement actions.\n\nThe Department of Justice is investigating the U.S.'s largest tech firms for allegedly monopolistic behavior. Roughly 20 years ago, a similar case threatened to destabilize Microsoft. WSJ explains.\n\nThe House probe represents a threat to the firms, even if it doesn\u2019t result in changes to antitrust laws. Documents released to lawmakers could become public and serve as justification to summon top executives to high-profile hearings. That would create risks to the companies\u2019 reputations and could fuel political pressure for a regulatory crackdown.\n\nThe House panel\u2019s detailed information requests also provide hints as to how authorities could try to build an antitrust case against the firms:\n\n\u2014The request to Alphabet targets 24 products and services, from advertising technology to YouTube and the Waze navigation app, seeking executives\u2019 communications regarding acquisitions and how other businesses interact with Google\u2019s own services.\n\n\u2014The lawmakers asked Amazon to provide executive communications related to product searches on Amazon.com and the pricing of Amazon Prime as well as fees charged to sellers.\n\n\u2014Apple was asked for executives\u2019 emails about search rankings in its App Store, whether Apple has discussed copying some third-party apps and the company\u2019s policy on requiring that apps use Apple\u2019s payment systems for purchases, an issue raised by Spotify Technology SA . The Wall Street Journal has reported that Apple routinely lists apps ahead of competitors though the company\u2019s apps skirt its own rules for rankings.\n\nApple, which takes a 30% cut from most apps it sells, has said the App Store encourages competition and that its cut is justified by the work its staff does reviewing apps to protect consumers from malware or other threats. Its apps account for a small fraction of those available on the store, and it collects money from only 16% of the 2 million apps available.\n\n\u2014Facebook received questions about its executives\u2019 discussions around the acquisitions of WhatsApp, Instagram, and the data-security app Onavo, as well as decisions related to how third-party apps work on its social-media platform.\n\nBig tech companies have ramped up spending to influence the new antitrust discourse, as well as other policy debates, none more so than Google. It is a funder of at least 33 nonprofit groups that are active in the antitrust debate across the political spectrum, according to its public policy transparency reports.\n\nGoogle is also a financial supporter of minority lawmaker groups such as the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute. It has given substantial sums to state attorneys general groups over the last decade or so, including more than $450,000 to the Democratic Attorneys General Association and more than $250,000 to the Republican Attorneys General Association, according to data gathered by the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nIts Google NetPAC contributed about $1.9 million to federal candidates and committees in the 2017-2018 election cycle, according to federal data, compared with about $1.8 million for Amazon\u2019s PAC and about $721,000 for Facebook\u2019s. Amazon leads the group in spending for the 2020 election to date. Apple doesn\u2019t have a PAC.\n\nAmazon in 2017 gave $12,500 each to the Democratic and Republican attorneys general associations. For 2018 it bumped that up to $50,000 each\n\nStaffers on the Judiciary Committee are simultaneously dealing with other time-consuming issues, most notably potential impeachment proceedings. That said, the bipartisan nature of Friday\u2019s letters reflects broad support for the probe.\n\nCongress has a history of going after emails, although those from top-level executives tend to be less revelatory because cautious higher-ranking people typically send few such online communications, investigators have found. In 2010, Senate investigators released an email from then-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein in which he appeared to acknowledge that the firm dodged a bullet in the financial crisis by betting on a market decline through taking \u201cshort\u201d positions.\n\nBut generally, emails from lower-level employees have led to more criticism. A 2010 probe of the BP PLC oil spill made headlines when a lower-level employee said in an email \u201cwho cares\u201d about a shortage of parts on a drilling rig before it exploded. In the General Motors Co. ignition-switch crisis, the company pinned the blame largely on a single engineer who received emails warning him of problems.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Congress has probed whether large tech companies are stifling competition. In 2011, the Senate Judiciary Committee hauled Mr. Schmidt, former Google Inc. executive chairman, for questioning related to whether the company was abusing its dominance of online searches by steering users toward its own services at the expense of rivals. But he emerged largely unscathed, and amid a weak recovery from the worst recession since the Great Depression, Congress had little appetite to pursue a probe into a driver of the U.S. economy.\n\nBig Tech Probes Here\u2019s a look at the investigations into big technology companies Congress : House Judiciary Committee is seeking executive emails and other records from Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon as part of an investigation into anti-competitive practices.\n\n: House Judiciary Committee is seeking executive emails and other records from Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon as part of an investigation into anti-competitive practices.
