It was 15 percent on Monday.\n\nDon't Miss 2.7 K SHARES 26.5 K SHARES 22.5 K SHARES 9.6 K SHARES\n\nThe period between October 15 and November 15 is considered critical as maximum number of stubble burning incidents takes place in this span, in Punjab and adjoining states. It is one of the main reasons for the alarming spike in pollution in Delhi-NCR.\n\nBut as the skies lit up with fireworks and the streets with crackers on Diwali, pollution levels peaked across north India.\n\nWith Delhi's air quality plummeting to dangerous levels around Diwali every year, the Supreme Court had in 2018 banned polluting firecrackers and ordered that only green firecrackers -which are said to cause 30 per cent less pollution - can be manufactured and sold. It also enforced a two-hour limit for setting them off.\n\nThe Arvind Kejriwal government also organised a mega laser show in an effort to dissuade people from bursting crackers.\n\nHowever, a large number of revellers brazenly flouted the Supreme Court-enforced two-hour limit for bursting crackers this year too.\n\nThe AQI is expected to enter the 'severe' category in the upcoming days due to firecrackers, unfavorable weather, and significant stubble burning.\n\nAn AQI between 0-50 is considered 'good', 51-100 'satisfactory', 101-200 'moderate', 201-300 'poor', 301-400 'very poor', and 401-500 'severe'. Above 500 is 'severe-plus emergency' category.", "description": "The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, on Monday predicted that the share of smoke from stubble burning in Delhi's PM 2.5 concentration is likely to jump to 25 percent on Tuesday.
