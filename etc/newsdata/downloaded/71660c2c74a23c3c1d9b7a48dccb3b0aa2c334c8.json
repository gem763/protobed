We had been running a pub in Hertfordshire and looking for an opportunity to return to our Welsh roots; the Skirrid offered that. With its reputation for paranormal activity, it couldn\u2019t have been more different from the beautiful thatched pub we were leaving; but I love places full of history and intrigue. I enjoy horror films, too.\n\nWalk in and it\u2019s like entering a castle, with stone-flagged floors everywhere. It\u2019s said there was a building here as early as 1110 and, though it\u2019s impossible to verify, we do claim to be the oldest pub in Wales \u2013 most of the main bar dates from the Tudor period, and upstairs, where our guests stay, was a courtroom until Cromwell\u2019s time. Many of the alleged ghosts are connected to that room. Local legend has it that George Jeffreys, the notorious 17th-century \u201changing judge\u201d, may have heard cases here, and that 182 people have been executed in the building. We keep a noose on the staircase, hanging from the beam that was supposedly used; it has score marks on it said to have been caused by the weight of hanging bodies.\n\nThough I\u2019m sceptical about these stories, during the 14 years we\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve experienced my fair share of unexplained phenomena. On our first night at the inn, before we\u2019d even taken over, we were sleeping in a big four-poster bed when Sharon complained of something tugging on her leg. It happened several times during the night and we had to keep turning the lights on. Of course, there was nothing there, but we barely slept. Later, we learned that relatives of people who were slow to die during a hanging would yank on their loved ones\u2019 legs to end their suffering. I was quite shaken by that.\n\nNot long after that, my young grandson went to the toilet and came back complaining, \u201cThe man in the long dress won\u2019t let me in!\u201d There was no one else in the place at the time \u2013 even Sharon was out. Brave man that I am, I made him hang on until she came back.\n\nI\u2019ve only once seen a full figure \u2013 a coachman-like character in a tricorn hat, standing in the porch in broad daylight. He caught my eye for a second or two, then was gone. That was about eight years ago and since then I\u2019ve sometimes thought, \u201cDid I really see that?\u201d Obviously it would be great for business if I kept coming out with these stories, but I do question everything.\n\nThe pub attracts a lot of psychics, paranormal investigators and TV crews. I\u2019ve seen a few dodgy spiritualists over the years, but the ones who genuinely seem to believe in what they\u2019re doing and don\u2019t take themselves too seriously are always welcome. Our bar regulars get on well with the visitors \u2013 they love showing them around and telling their own uncanny stories. Most of the staff have had strange encounters, too \u2013 we\u2019ve had glasses and customers\u2019 change flying off the bar, unexplained cold spots in rooms, and one young woman who said an unseen presence whispered, then roared in her ear.\n\nExperience: I grew up in a cemetery Read more\n\nOur best-known former resident is an 18th-century barmaid called Fanny Price, who died of consumption and is buried in the local churchyard. She has been spotted frequently and people often say they can smell lavender just before she appears. There have been more troubling manifestations \u2013 on half a dozen occasions, guests have shown me strange marks that have appeared around their necks \u2013 but there\u2019s only been one instance of outright malevolence that I\u2019m aware of. A woman came running down from one of the bedrooms, hair wet and dressed only in a coat, saying, \u201cShe tried to kill me!\u201d Apparently she\u2019d been in the bath and something had held her down under the water. I thought it was interesting that she said \u201cshe\u201d rather than \u201che\u201d or \u201cit\u201d, but she didn\u2019t stick around to explain and I\u2019ve been unable to contact her since.\n\nSceptical as I am, I don\u2019t take any chances and I do maintain the local tradition of every night putting out the Pwcca Cup, a special tankard filled with ale to appease the devil. On a windy night this time of year, when I go outside and the pub sign is swinging and the wind\u2019s howling, I do look over my shoulder. One day I\u2019m going to turn round and something\u2019s going to be there. I think it will be the end of me. Especially if it\u2019s a clown. They scare me to death.\n\n\u2022 As told to Chris Broughton\n\nDo you have an experience to share?
