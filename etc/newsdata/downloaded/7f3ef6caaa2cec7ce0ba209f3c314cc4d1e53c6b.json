It\u2019s just that he had no idea what he was talking about; at one point, he even tweeted that Alabama should brace for landfall. The National Weather Service then tweeted a correction, since Alabama was not near the storm\u2019s predicted path.\n\n\u201cYou know things are bad when the National Weather Service has to factcheck the president,\u201d Colbert said.\n\nAdditionally, Trump claimed to have never heard of a category 5 hurricane, leaving Colbert incredulous, since three other category 5 storms have hit during his presidency. \u201cYou know how I know that? From listening to you not know what they are,\u201d Colbert said before playing four clips, dating from 2017 to this spring, in which Trump repeated the same line about not knowing a category 5 storm could exist.\n\nSeth Meyers on Trump: 'Lying for him is as natural as breathing' Read more\n\n\u201cSo \u2026 you have heard of it, and then you haven\u2019t heard of it. And then you have and then you haven\u2019t,\u201d Colbert summarized. \u201cYou have the memory of a goldfish, to go along with the skin tone.\u201d\n\nFinally, Trump reportedly suggested to advisers, in all seriousness, that the US should consider nuking hurricanes as they form off the coast of Africa. \u201cSo the most powerful man in the world wants to nuke the wind,\u201d Colbert said, letting the words hang. According to an Axios report, Trump\u2019s suggestion left the room stunned; one source said: \u201cYou could hear a gnat fart in that meeting \u2026 We thought, \u2018What the fuck? What do we do with this?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cUm, get a better president?\u201d Colbert answered. \u201cBecause that farting gnat would be a better president.\u201d\n\nTrevor Noah\n\nOn The Daily Show, Trevor Noah also skewered Trump\u2019s lack of preparedness for Hurricane Dorian. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Trump was having a slow weekend or the barometric pressure from the storm did something to his brain, because not only did he forget how big the storm was, but he forgot where it was going,\u201d Noah said in reference to Trump\u2019s inaccurate tweet about Alabama.\n\nThe Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) Hurricane Dorian meets Sh*tstorm Donald. pic.twitter.com/S4fJWmgXV2\n\n\u201cI know we\u2019re used to it by now, but it still amazes me how often the government has to tell you not to pay attention to the president,\u201d Noah continued. \u201cTrump is like your friend who you\u2019re driving home from a wisdom teeth surgery. He\u2019s all drugged up, yelling crazy shit out the next window like: \u2018There\u2019s a dragon in the next car!\u2019\u201d\n\nA dragon in the next car makes about as much sense as nuking a hurricane, a suggestion Noah nevertheless dismissed. \u201cNot only will it not stop the hurricane, but now you have nuclear fallout being spread by 200-mile-an-hour winds. The stuff is going to go everywhere \u2013 it\u2019s like taking a dump in an open Vitamix.\u201d\n\nGiven the potential of a radioactive ocean, Noah concluded, it\u2019s probably better that Trump stay on the golf course, where he spent most of his weekend after cancelling a diplomatic trip to Poland in order to stay on top of the storm.\n\n\u201cLook, I know people get mad when they see Trump playing golf as a hurricane is closing in,\u201d Noah said. \u201cBut after everything we\u2019ve heard, I think the less involved Trump is with this hurricane, the better it is.\u201d\n\nSeth Meyers\n\nTrump\u2019s blustering response to Hurricane Dorian was also the focus of Late Night, where Seth Meyers called BS on Trump\u2019s claim that he had never of a category 5 hurricane. At the very least, the ignorance to category 5 is definitely \u201cnot what anyone wants to hear from the president when a hurricane is bearing down on them\u201d, Meyers said. \u201cIt\u2019s like if you called 911 and the operator said: \u2018Shit! 104-degree fever?! I didn\u2019t know they went that high!\u2019\u201d\n\nIn other words, Meyers continued: \u201cTrump is incapable of and uninterested in delivering on the basic duties of his office. In fact, he often makes the situation worse.\u201d Case in point: the incorrect tweet about Alabama, which the National Weather Service had to correct.\n\n\u201cWhat other corrections is the government going to have to put out as Trump\u2019s brain continues to deteriorate?\u201d Meyers wondered. \u201cWe\u2019re like a week away from the justice department tweeting: \u2018Contrary to the president\u2019s tweet, the Joker is NOT a threat, he\u2019s a character in a movie played by Joaquin Phoenix. There is no evacuation of Gotham under way nor is Gotham a real place.\u2019\u201d\n\n", "description": "Late-night hosts return from August vacation with a look at the president\u2019s less than informed response to Hurricane Dorian", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52107dc477b39a2a3a8112df7b0a5c1c087f4660/97_0_1658_995/master/1658.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0ba7c70214abf31a6427db31ed3406b1"}
