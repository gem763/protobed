He sees title contention in his future, but Pena, 26, said by that point he expects Nurmagomedov to be out of the picture.\n\n\u201cBy the time I make it into the title picture, Khabib is going to be retired or on the way out,\u201d Pena said. \u201cI think by the time the belt is going to be talked about, Khabib is going to be on his way out, Islam (Makhachev) will probably be out there, and I\u2019ll be still fighting in the top 15 or top 10. We\u2019ll cross that road when it comes.\u201d\n\nTo hear more from Pena on training with Nurmagomedov and Islam Makhachev, as well as his fight with Frevola, watch the video above.", "description": "Luis Pena spent a good portion of his training camp for UFC on ESPN+ 19 preparing alongside Khabib Nurmagomedov.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Farah Hannoun", "John Morgan"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/luis-pena-ufc-tampa-pre-fight-interview.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
