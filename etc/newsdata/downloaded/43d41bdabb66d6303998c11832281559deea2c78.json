As first gymnast who scored perfect 10.0 at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, and then, received six more perfect 10s to win three gold medals, it becomes very special. I've urged to introduce these kids to me. https://t.co/ahYVws8VCB \u2014 Kiren Rijiju (@KirenRijiju) August 30, 2019\n\nFortunately, the children were swiftly identified and asked to go for trials by Manmeet Singh Goindi, the regional director of SAI (Sports Authority of India) Eastern Centre, on Wednesday, The Telegraph India reports.\n\n\"Yes, I have met the kids. The coaches here too have seen them,\" Goindi told The Telegraph.\n\n\"They are certainly talented and have the desire to achieve much. I have spoken to their parents and both sets of parents are keen to enroll the children here.\"\n\n\"At SAI, not only will the children get food, lodging, and proper education, they will also be trained under qualified gymnastics coaches. Plus, the right equipments will be made available to them.\n\n\"They will practise in proper indoor halls. No more will they have to jump around on the road and somersault on concrete, risking injuries.\"\n\nBoth children are currently pupils at Sanghamitra Vidyalaya school in Kolkata, according to the Telegraph, and although they've attended dance lessons, neither has had any gymnastics training.\n\nTheir dance teacher, Shekhar Rao, offers free hip-hop dance classes for underprivileged children, and he filmed the video.\n\n\"In the locality where these children live, not much importance is given to dance,\" Rao told the Telegraph.\n\n\"They think that it is only through academics that they can earn a living. But I train these boys and girls because they are talented.\"\n\nThe talented duo were simply trying to impress their teacher.\n\n\"We improvised some of it on the spot,\" Khan, who lives in a one-room house in Garden Reach slum with her parents and two siblings, told the Telegraph.\n\n\"Sir gets scared when we do some moves on the road. In fact, that day also we were doing it only in play but he made a video and it went viral.\n\n\"We had not thought that a world-famous gymnast would post our video.\"\n\nAt 11 and 12, they're the perfect age to start formal gymnastics training, Goindi told the Telegraph.\n\nAnd both children seem thrilled by what's happened.\n\n\"I felt great joy when I came to know about it, I told my parents too and they were very happy,\" Khan told Asian News International.\n\n\"I have been doing it for four years, I want to become a gymnast like Nadia Comaneci in the future.\"\n\nMohammad Azajuddin: I want to do something to make my dance teacher proud. If I get a chance to do gymnastics in future, I will take it but I will never stop dancing.
