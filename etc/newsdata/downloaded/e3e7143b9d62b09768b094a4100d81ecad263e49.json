Labor Day is over. The \"new\" has worn off. They\u2019ve seen the friends they missed over the summer. Now, the stomach aches have begun on Sunday nights. The morning tears. The frequent visits to the school nurse. The calls or texts to come get her. The headaches that seem to disappear as soon as you make the decision to let him stay home and miss.\n\nIt\u2019s about the time in my counseling office that I start to see an influx of girls and boys who have what is referred to as \"school refusal.\" In fact, The Anxiety and Depression Association of America states that between 2 to 5 percent of school age children suffer from school refusal.\n\nFRAZZLED GIRL'S ADORABLE BACK-TO-SCHOOL PHOTO GOES VIRAL\n\nSchool refusal typically takes place when a child is transitioning between school settings, such as beginning middle or high school. And it most commonly affects children between the ages of five and six, or 10 and 11.\n\nIf you have a child who is school-aged, introverted or has a touch of anxiety, you\u2019ve likely encountered some degree of school refusal. I\u2019m about to say something that you might not love\u2014and your school refusing child certainly won\u2019t. To work through any fear, we all have to do the scary thing. Your child included.\n\nYou see, I\u2019ve been counseling children and families for 27 years. I have a new book out on anxiety called \"Raising Worry-Free Girls,\" and one for elementary-aged girls coming out in December called \"Braver, Stronger, Smarter.\" (Yes, after the quote from Pooh.) To do the research for those books, I read 23 books on anxiety. The research agrees that your child has to learn to do the scary thing. And one of the other most important things I learned and have experienced counseling children with anxiety (as well as anxious parents) is that anxiety is about anxiety. It\u2019s not about whatever the given subject is at the time.\n\nAll children long to be independent. To feel brave and confident. In fact, research says that the more courage needed for the task, the more confidence they derive from that task.\n\nLet\u2019s start with why certain children are anxious. What I tell kids in my office is that is the smartest, kindest, most conscientious, try-hard kinds of children (and adults, I\u2019d add) who struggle with worry. It\u2019s because things matter so much \u2014 that sometimes it\u2019s hard to turn the volume on that matter down. And so, they worry.\n\nWhat happens with worry and development is that it follows a pattern. I tell kids that it's a lot like the one loop roller coaster at the fair. So, whatever your child is fearful about at the time, is what loops and loops around in their thoughts. That loop \u2014 or anxiety topic \u2014 will change with their development.\n\nFor example, most young children will worry about either being separated or something bad happening to one of their parents. I have seen a multitude of 3rd and 4th graders over the years who have \"looping\" thoughts around throwing up.\n\nMost 7th and 8th graders \"loop\" about something that involves being embarrassed in front of their peers or failing in school or in athletics. Basically, whatever is the worst thing they can imagine at a particular age is what their looping thoughts center on. It\u2019s the same reason your looping thoughts often center around something bad happening to your child.\n\nThe fact that their worries shift with their development is also often why anxiety often goes undetected. In fact, statistics say that children often go two years before a child receives treatment for anxiety.\n\nThe problem with that is anxiety left untreated only gets worse. In addition, the two most common strategies parents use when faced with anxiety in their child are escape and avoidance.\n\nWe just said that to work through anxiety a child has to do the scary thing. So, in essence, we\u2019re unwittingly making the problem worse. I believe it\u2019s one of the primary reasons why we\u2019re looking at one in four children now battling anxiety, with girls twice as likely to suffer from it as boys. In fact, we\u2019re seeing more anxiety among children than either during the Great Depression or World War II.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWe have got to do something to change the statistics.\n\nSo, let\u2019s go back to school. Or, school refusal, in particular. Several of the children I\u2019ve seen in the past year with school refusal have wise parents who have armed them with coping strategies to keep themselves or get themselves back into school. And, typically by October, their children are doing much better. I\u2019ve also seen very well-meaning families who are now homeschooling their children.\n\nNow, there are times when the anxiety takes such a turn that a child is not physically or emotionally able to attend school. They are literally vomiting every morning. I\u2019ve counseled those children before. The problem is that a child who stays home long-term has reinforcements on several levels, as you can imagine.\n\nThe child who is afraid to be away from their parents has that much more time with their primary caregiver.\n\nThe child who is afraid to interact with peers is removed from those peers, although likely still interacts with peers \u2014 but ones they know and feel comfortable around already.\n\nThe child who is fearful about the academic pressure of school is removed from the pressure from teachers and administrators and taught by someone with whom they likely already feel comfortable.\n\nNone of those children are learning to do the scary thing.\n\nEscape and avoidance. Neither help. We\u2019ve got to do something different. For more on practical help, see next week's article on how to help your child work through an anxious school day. But, for now, at least make steps toward school.\n\nIf your child physically can\u2019t go, make sure to have them do the work at home that he would be doing in school. Give her the same hours and structure she would find there. Set a goal for when he can go back, and then start small. Have her go a few hours per day, with a plan for what to do when she gets anxious.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nYour child can do it, with support. In fact, no matter how much he pushes against you, he really longs to do the scary thing. All children long to be independent. To feel brave and confident. In fact, research says that the more courage needed for the task, the more confidence they derive from that task. Let\u2019s help kids find their way to more of both confidence and courage.\n\nLet\u2019s stop rescuing them and inadvertently communicating to them that rescuing is what they need. They are braver and stronger and smarter than they have any idea.
