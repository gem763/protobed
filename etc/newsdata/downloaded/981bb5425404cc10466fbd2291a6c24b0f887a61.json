Wednesday morning, two associates of Rudy Giuliani were arrested on campaign finance charges. Trump disavowed knowledge of the two men, and any involvement with his campaign, on the White House lawn Thursday afternoon. He did qualify that disavowal with acknowledgement that he may have been photographed with the two men. \u201cNow it\u2019s possible I have a picture with them because I have a picture with everybody. I have a picture with everybody here. But somebody said that there may be a picture or something at a fundraiser or somewhere. But I have pictures with everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anybody I don\u2019t have pictures with. I don\u2019t know them.\u201d\n\nThe President just said \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anybody I don\u2019t have pictures with.\u201d This photo I was sent earlier today of him and Shannon Hoon leads me to believe this is the first true statement he\u2019s made in months. pic.twitter.com/ZOeOWt0nQn \u2014 Jon Wurster (@jonwurster) October 10, 2019\n\nDrummer and comedy personality Jon Wurster pointed out that this may be the first verifiable truth Trump has spoken in months. As an avid brand extender, Donald Trump has truly been photographed with everyone. Wurster cited a photo of Trump with late Blind Melon singer Shannon Hoon as proof, but one could easily substitute his cameo on The Nanny or Home Alone 2. Or on TRL with Lala Anthony and Mekhi Phifer. Point is, dude has no shame about getting the face out there. But Trump is wrong to claim that his penchant for photos absolves him of wrongdoing. It took two seconds of Googling to find out that Trump was photographed with Shannon Hoon at a Blind Melon concert in either 1994 or 1995, after taking Ivanka to see one of her then-favorite bands. He\u2019s in Home Alone 2 because he owned the Plaza Hotel at the time. And if he\u2019s in a photo with Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas, it\u2019s because they did alleged crimes together. It seems complicated, but really all I can say is that his life is pretty plain.", "description": "Donald Trump tried to explain away his association with Rudy Giuliani collaborators Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas by saying he has photos with everyone.
