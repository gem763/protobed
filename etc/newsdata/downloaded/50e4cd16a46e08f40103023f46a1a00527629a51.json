Bursting with bucolic mountain tarns and rugged windswept fells, these picture-perfect lands \u2013 a collection of blustery Cumbrian counties bordered by the Pennines and the Irish sea \u2013 provided inspiration for Romantic poets and children\u2019s authors alike.\n\nStill as captivating as ever, this Unesco heritage site is also home to some of the most splendid boutique hotels in the UK. Here\u2019s our pick of the best.\n\nThe Independent's hotel reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust. On some occasions, we earn revenue if you click the links and book, but we never allow this to affect our coverage.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHarried city-dwellers will find the perfect spot to relax in The Forest Side, a beautifully renovated Gothic pile (now a restaurant with rooms) that dates back to 1853. Set on the outskirts of Grasmere, it offers prime access to the north and central lakes \u2013 Windermere is a pretty 25-minute drive away \u2013 and Wordsworth\u2019s Dove cottage is reachable on foot.\n\nRooms are high-ceilinged with modern touches (like pea-green succulents and beech wood furniture) while the rest of the place shimmers with burnished silver, velvet sofas and soft shades of grey. The restaurant serves up Michelin-starred fare (there\u2019s also an expansive kitchen garden, a charcuterie and the chef has a predilection for on-site pickling) and the surrounding grounds are speckled with roe deer and rare red squirrels.\n\nFrom \u00a3229 per night\n\ntheforestside.com\n\nWant to escape the hordes of Wellington-wearing tourists that clamber across Lakeland\u2019s most famous mountains? Head slightly further afield and settle into the vintage furniture at Brownber Hall. Its location in the lovely upper Lune Valley, with views across Howgill fells, put it within prime striking distance of the Lake District, without the hassle of the crowds.\n\nThe homely but hip feel extends from the communal spaces to the guest house\u2019s eight rooms, with eclectic design touches and a home-away-from-home vibe. This is prime walking territory, and the path below the house runs through Smardale Nature Reserve, and there\u2019s horse-riding, wild swimming and star-gazing on your doorstep, too.\n\nFrom \u00a390 per night\n\nbrownberhall.co.uk\n\nAnother Place, The Lake, Ullswater\n\nViews of Ullswater\u2019s sail-flecked surface can be soaked up from almost all 40 rooms at the preposterously pretty Another Place, The Lake. You\u2019ll see it from the infinity pool at the Swim Club spa too, which is entirely encased in glass (there\u2019s also a hot tub on the terrace for steamy evenings under the stars). Here, Georgian grandeur meets contemporary cool, and rooms are splashed with pops of daffodil-yellow, blush pink and teal.\n\nThe new Joules suite is particularly pretty, with a comfy four-poster and homely design touches from the unmistakably British brand. Down at the lake you\u2019ll find running trails, kayaks for hire and open water swimming for the brave. Then warm up at the Rampsbeck restaurant with regional produce from salt-baked turnip to local-reared pork.\n\nFrom \u00a3180 per night\n\nanother.place\n\nEnclaved by pretty polished gardens and with views of Victorian steamers gliding across the lake, Linthwaite House is a satisfying blend of old and new. Outside its windows, rugged fells rise like giants; inside, contemporary interiors \u2013 like shellback chairs upholstered in green velvet and leopard print \u2013 gleam like treasure.\n\nThe 30 bedrooms have each been designed by Beverley Boswell, the woman behind the interiors of South African sister properties Leeu Estates, Leeu House and Le Quartier Fran\u00e7ais in the Cape Winelands. Michelin-starred chef Simon Rogan will take over the restaurant here in October 2019, opening Henrock, with small sharing plates including raw aged beef, elderberry and shiso; halibut baked in cabbage leaf, bay shrimp and pink pepper; and fried apple pie, miso butterscotch and cassia clotted cream.\n\nFrom \u00a3200 per night\n\nlinthwaitehouse.com\n\nBrimstone, Ambleside\n\nTucked into the trees, Brimstone offers next-level service to its well-heeled guests. Step through the doors of this chic, chalet-style retreat and you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking you\u2019d wafted into an upmarket alpine ski retreat \u2013 all slick slate, polished wood and gleaming glass. But delve further and you\u2019ll find sculptural velvet, moss-green upholstery and soothing coffee\u2013toned leather. There\u2019s no chintz here, and the staff are just as smart, helping to kit guests out with wet weather gear and providing all-important advice on walking routes. After a day on the trails, return to the soothing surrounds of the swanky spa for mineral steam baths, hot stone massages and dual treatments in the just-for-two couple\u2019s spa.\n\nFrom \u00a3370 per night; brimstonehotel.co.uk\n\nIn search of total privacy? Check into one of the classy standalone spa lodges at Gilpin for a truly luxurious retreat from it all (in this case, luxury comes in the shape of your own en-suite spa with rainmaker showers, steam rooms, hydrotherapy hot tubs and saunas).\n\nBetter yet, head a mile down the road to the six-bedroomed Lake House. Wrapped in 100 private acres, this renovated fishing lodge comes with cedarwood hot tubs, floor-to-ceiling views across the lake and its own army of staff. Back at the main house, the Edwardian building houses a mish-mash of uniquely-shaped rooms, all decked out in modern country-house style. Out the windows you\u2019ll spot alpacas grazing in the gardens and at the centre of the house you\u2019ll find the Michelin-starred HRiSHi, which serves up modern British dishes with a twist, such as Norfolk Quail three ways and peanut butter semifreddo with hot fudge and banana ice cream.\n\nFrom \u00a3245 per night\n\nthegilpin.co.uk.\n\nThe Samling is so stylishly low-key, even the deer that keep the grass trimmed are almost absurdly relaxed. More of a townhouse than a county pile, you\u2019ll find artwork by Matisse, Picasso and Chagalle on the walls, and d\u00e9cor is a sophisticated mix of dove grey, soft silver and powder blue textiles. Set in 67 acres, the gabled Georgian house is surrounded by kestrel-filled grounds and woodlands dripping in gold lichen, and the eastern shores of Lake Windermere are so close you\u2019ll hear them lapping as you kick back in the outdoor hot tub.\n\nAsk at reception for walking guides or, if the weather\u2019s not on your side, book a wine-tasting session using the Coravin system in the smart cellar (their list is rated as one of the top 500 in the world). The hotel\u2019s refreshingly dog-friendly too (although it will set you back \u00a325 per furry friend) and the grounds are ideal for long, head-clearing walks.\n\nFrom \u00a3230 per night\n\nthesamlinghotel.co.uk\n\nL\u2019Enclume, Cartmel\n\nThis is a wonderfully higgledy-piggledy sort of place, actually a restaurant with a smattering of cottage rooms dotted around the village of Cartmel. Accommodation is smart but unfussy, making way for the real draw: the food. Overseen by Simon Rogan, the two-Michelin starred L\u2019Enclume is a former wheel-makers and smithy. The tasting menu calls on ingredients from the 12-acre kitchen garden to produce dishes such as Goosnargh duck with cherries and smoked beetroot, and butter poached turbot with courgettes and nasturtium. There\u2019s also a chef\u2019s table and development kitchen where you can get a glimpse of the magic that happens behind the scenes.\n\nFrom \u00a3175 per night\n\nlenclume.co.uk.\n\nWith views stretching across to Bassenthwaite Lake, Skiddaw and the spellbinding Lakeland Fells, Armathwaite \u2013 which has stood on its site in one form or another since the 11th century \u2013 has all the trappings of a historic country house. Set in 400 acres of private woodland, the hotel\u2019s interiors, particularly in the main hall, are original and grand: sweeping staircases, open fire places, classic wood paneling and oil paintings steeped in history. Rooms themselves are neat and unfussy.\n\nThere\u2019s an award-winning spa and seasonal restaurant dishing up tasty lamb rump dishes and milk ice cream with bee pollen, but it the experience programme here that\u2019s most impressive, with everything from archery and clay pigeon shooting, to photography workshops and via ferrata tours on offer for guests.\n\nFrom \u00a3170 per night\n\narmathwaite-hall.com\n\nStorrs Hall has stories to tell. Built in 1790, in its heyday it welcomed the likes of William Wordsworth and Beatrix Potter for glamorous social occasions (the former recited his famous Daffodils in the drawing room). Today, it stands resplendent on the shores of Lake Windermere, with original architecture and large lattice-framed windows peering out like huge eyes. Interiors are relaxed and fitting for a country house, with pretty stained glass and cosy nooks filled with model boats and busts of famous creatives.\n\nAccommodation ranges from cosy rooms and self-catered lodges, to a swish converted boathouse right on the water, with a steam room, fire pit and hot tub (four junior suites also come with dual aspect views of the water and surrounding countryside).\n\nFrom \u00a3180 per night\n\nstorrshall.com", "description": "The best boutique hotels in the Lake District, from spa-focused boltholes to restaurants with rooms, as chosen by our resident expert.", "authors": ["Lizzie Pook"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/18/16/istock-165486267.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
