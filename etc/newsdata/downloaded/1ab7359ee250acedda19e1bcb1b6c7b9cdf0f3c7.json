During the 1993 and 1997 campaigns, Kislin, his relatives and companies donated $46,250 to the mayor and his political allies.\n\nKislin\u2019s alleged ties to Russian mobsters in Brooklyn and in the former Soviet republics was reported yesterday by the non-partisan Center for Public Integrity in Washington, D.C.\n\nCiting documents from the FBI and Interpol, the center reported that a Kislin company, Trans Commodities in Manhattan, laundered millions of dollars from Russia to New York and sponsored a visa for an alleged contract killer.\n\nIn an interview with the center, Kislin brushed off the allegations. He said he has been investigated by the FBI but never charged with a crime.\n\nA 1994 FBI report obtained by The Associated Press said Kislin is \u201ca member or associate\u201d of a Brighton Beach crime group run by Vyacheslav Ivankov, the imprisoned godfather of Russian organized crime in the United States.\n\nAsked about Kislin\u2019s appointment to the EDC, mayoral spokeswoman Sunny Mindel said, \u201cHe was appointed in 1996. These are allegations, and allegations that emerged two days ago.\u201d\n\nGiuliani, a former federal prosecutor, said he doesn\u2019t know anything about Kislin\u2019s alleged Russian mob ties.\n\n\u201cI know Mr. Kislin. I know his wife. In the last 2 \u00bd years, they\u2019ve made no contributions to me, at least as far as my records are concerned,\u201d said Giuliani.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of any of the allegations involving them. I think the report is wishful thinking on the part of the people who are trying to put it out.\u201d\n\nGiuliani said Kislin hasn\u2019t donated to any of his other campaign funds since his 1997 re-election.\n\nYet a program from a May 14, 1998, Giuliani fund-raiser lists Kislin and his wife, Ludmilla, as \u201cco-chairs.\u201d Kislin also was listed as a co-chair of Giuliani\u2019s main Senate fund-raiser last May 25, which took in $2.1 million.\n\nBruce Teitelbaum, who heads the mayor\u2019s campaign committee, said the Kislins\u2019 names appeared on the invitations because \u201cit\u2019s not an uncommon practice to use names of people who raised money in the past.\u201d\n\nGiuliani has not been the only recipient of Kislin\u2019s largess.\n\nIn last year\u2019s Senate race, Kislin and his family gave $8,000 to the ultimate victor, Democrat Charles Schumer, and $1,000 to Republican Alfonse D\u2019Amato.\n\nCity Comptroller Alan Hevesi has received $11,000 from the Kislins since 1994.\n\nKislin could not be reached last night. He was reportedly vacationing in the Bahamas.", "description": "A wealthy commodities trader who gave thousands of dollars to Mayor Giuliani\u2019s mayoral campaigns and landed a post on the city\u2019s Economic...", "authors": ["December"], "top_image": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/nypost-2016/static/images/apple-icons/nypost/apple-icon.png", "published_at": "1999-12-22"}
