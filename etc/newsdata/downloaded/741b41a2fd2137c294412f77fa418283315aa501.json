The HR tool, founded in 2015 by Altman and Eric Koslow, is also backed by Thrive Capital, the Slack Fund, Khosla Ventures and Y Combinator.\n\nLattice, like many startups closing venture capital deals today, was not actively fundraising when approached by John Curtius of Tiger Global, a firm that invested in the likes of Spotify, Glassdoor and Flipkart. Rather than reject the sizable capital infusion that, according to Altman, included favorable terms, Lattice closed the deal and plans to invest additional cash in its sales and marketing efforts, among other opportunities.\n\n\u201cTiger was excited by the vision to keep [expanding] this platform \u2014 to extend to the rest of people management,\u201d Altman tells TechCrunch.\n\nLattice, which has raised a total of $49.2 million in venture capital funding to date, doubled its headcount this year as well as its paying user count, which has swelled to 160,000. The SaaS business has developed performance management software that allows employees to reflect on their performance and receive feedback from managers and peers. The tool also empowers employees and their managers to structure agendas for one-on-one sessions, send praise to other employees and draft goals and OKRs.\n\n\u201cIn order to compete for talent today, you do need to build the type of company where people want to work \u2014 it\u2019s not just a money thing,\u201d said Altman.\n\nLast fall, the San Francisco-based startup introduced Lattice Engagement, giving human resources teams a better idea of employees\u2019 level of connection to their company. Last month, the company launched Lattice Pulse, which, in combination with Lattice Engagement and Lattice Performance, delivers real-time insight into employees and company culture.\n\n\u201cYou can get away with not doing these things, but it doesn\u2019t optimize this critical thing, which is how your people are,\u201d explains Altman. \u201cIf you don\u2019t pay attention to how your people are performing or how they are feeling, it would be like not listening to your customers. Your employees are like your internal customers. If you don\u2019t care how they\u2019re doing or how they\u2019re feeling, you\u2019re leaving unbelievably important information on the table.\u201d\n\nLattice operates a SaaS business model, charging roughly $100 per user per year. The company sells primarily to small and medium-sized businesses, including Glossier and Asana and some 1,400 others. This year, Lattice struck a deal with Slack, one of its largest customers yet. Over time, the company plans to sell to larger enterprises.\n\n\u201cMy hope is we can just keep on adding products and functionality to what we offer,\u201d Altman said. \u201cWe have so many more ideas than we have people to build them.\u201d", "description": "Lattice raises another $25 million.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jack-Eric-_-Founder-Photo.jpg?w=600", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
