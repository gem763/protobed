The Lone Star state, after all, is normally more focused on loosening restrictions on guns than tightening protections for women. Well, it\u2019s largely because the female-focused dating app Bumble is based in Austin and lobbied local politicians to make it happen.\n\n\u201cIf indecent exposure is a crime on the streets, then why is it not on your phone or computer?\u201d Bumble\u2019s founder, Whitney Wolfe Herd, asked Texas lawmakers at a hearing earlier this year. \u201cWe have to call on you because as tech companies, we can only do so much.\u201d Legislators agreed and the bill got bipartisan support.\n\nThe cyber-flashing act, which went into effect last Saturday, doesn\u2019t just apply to men sending dick pics; it bans the electronic transmission of unwanted visual material depicting any person\u2019s \u201cintimate parts\u201d as well as the \u201ccovered genitals of a male person that are in a discernibly turgid state\u201d.\n\nDespite its inclusive wording, however, the law clearly wasn\u2019t passed to prevent women sending unsolicited pictures of their vaginas to men \u2013 because that just isn\u2019t a thing. Although, back in 2015, a woman called Kerry Quin decided to send 40 unexpected pictures of a vagina (sourced from Google) to men on Bumble. She hoped that turning the tables like this would make men see how invasive unwanted dick pics are. As it turned out, however, most of the men were desperate to meet her after the graphic introduction.\n\nUnsolicited dick pics have become a ubiquitous part of modern life. A 2017 Pew Research poll, for example, found that 53% of young women say they\u2019ve been sent unwanted explicit images and 70% of women consider online harassment to be a \u201cmajor problem\u201d. Despite this, however, dick pics are often treated as an amusing cultural phenomenon rather than a serious issue. \u201cLately, it feels like men and women are being told that this increasingly common problem is really no big deal,\u201d Wolfe Herd noted to Texas lawmakers during hearings about the bill. \u201cWomen in particular are expected to laugh this sort of thing off. But there\u2019s nothing funny about it.\u201d\n\nWolfe Herde is right: the extent to which women are sexually harassed online is no joke. While experts agree that the new Texas law will be hard to enforce, the simple act of passing a law like this sends an important message; it\u2019s a reminder that unsolicited dick pics should not be considered normal or acceptable. Encouragingly, the UK is also taking steps to criminalize \u201conline flashing\u201d. The law has a long way to go when it comes to tackling digital harassment, but at least some small steps are being taken.\n\nCrazy big pay gap\n\nAdele Lim, a co-writer on hit romcom Crazy Rich Asians, has dropped out of the planned sequels because of a massive pay discrepancy. While Lim was going to make around $110,000 another writer, Peter Chiarelli, stood to get between $800,000 to $1m. Chiarelli reportedly offered to split his fee, but Lim insisted she \u201cshouldn\u2019t be dependent on the generosity of the white guy writer\u201d.\n\nSouth African women say #EnoughisEnough\n\nThousands of South African women have spent the last few days marching against gender-based violence, demanding that the country\u2019s president declare a state of emergency. The past month has seen a spate of brutal attacks against women; protesters held placards asking \u201cAm I next?\u201d and declaring \u201cEnough is enough\u201d.\n\nGoogle Maps lacks direction when it comes to abortion\n\n\u201cIn areas where abortion rights are under threat, confusing labels and a lack of policing by Google means misleading \u2013 and sometimes flat-out wrong \u2013 Google Maps results are common,\u201d Vice News reports. Users looking for abortion clinics are often referred to pro-life clinics or, in one instance, a memorial to \u201cunborn\u201d children.\n\nPain and Prejudice\n\n\u201cWomen wait longer for pain medication than men, wait longer to be diagnosed with cancer, are more likely to have their physical symptoms ascribed to mental health issues,\u201d writes the Guardian\u2019s Gabrielle Jackson in a piece about her new book, Pain and Prejudice. \u201cMost shockingly of all many women are living in constant pain and don\u2019t know that it\u2019s not normal.\u201d\n\nSiri, I\u2019ve got a question about feminism\n\nSorry, the engineers at Apple don\u2019t want to engage with sensitive things like that.\n\nA close look at middle age\n\n\u201cSigns of aging in women are treated as though they ought to be invisible,\u201d notes an excerpt from Midlife, photographer Elinor Carucci\u2019s book of intimate self-portraits. Rather than ignoring those signs, Carucci\u2019s photos, which have names like \u201cLipstick and facial hair\u201d, zoom in on them. \u201cTo treat signs of impending middle age with such gravity and drama is both absurd and \u2026 deeply honest about the kind of intense, exhausting self-monitoring that can feel like an inescapable part of owning a female body.\u201d\n\nScarlett Johansson defends Woody Allen\n\n\u201cI love Woody. I believe him, and I would work with him any time,\u201d Johansson said in a recent interview with the Hollywood Reporter. No doubt it won\u2019t be long before we hear that Johansson is taking the role of Soon-Yi Previn in a future movie. Or maybe she\u2019ll branch out and play a tree.", "description": "The Lone Star state is leading the way with a cyber-flashing act outlawing unsolicited penis pictures", "authors": ["Arwa Mahdawi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90c32a5b3f29c3132b3272148f0882ffb4d099c8/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=f1f1dc617bc3d89f20e2d7626c29ae57", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
