(Jose Luis Magana/AP)\n\nVice President Pence got laughs Friday as he told House Republicans that the champion racing horse American Pharoah once bit his arm so hard he \u201calmost collapsed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just gritted my teeth and smiled,\u201d Pence said at a Baltimore policy retreat, recalling a visit last year to the Kentucky farm where he met the famed Triple Crown winner. \u201cBecause you know what, in our line of work, you\u2019re gonna get bit sometimes, but you keep fighting forward.\u201d\n\nThe story drew cheers from the audience \u2014 but confusion from the farm manager who was by Pence\u2019s side for the encounter some billed as \u201cVP Meets AP.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he gave someone a nasty bite, I\u2019d know it,\u201d Dermot Ryan, the America manager for the racehorse-breeding company Coolmore, told the McClatchy news group.\n\nRyan said Friday that such behavior would be unexpected from a \u201csweet\u201d horse, though he added that the farm, Ashford Stud, was \u201chonored\u201d by Pence\u2019s visit, McClatchy reported. Ryan called the vice president \u201cvery pleasant.\u201d\n\nPence, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday night, was presented with a halter at the Versailles, Ky., site in March 2018 during a trip to support Rep. Garland \u201cAndy\u201d Barr (R-Ky.) in his ultimately successful but tight reelection bid against Democrat Amy McGrath.\n\nBarr spokeswoman Jodi Whitaker told McClatchy the congressman did not witness the alleged nip, though he invited Pence and joined him for the visit. But Barr saw the resulting bruise when Pence \u201cshowed it off on Air Force Two,\u201d Whitaker added.\n\nBarr\u2019s office did not immediately respond to an inquiry from The Washington Post, nor did farm manager Ryan and other staff at Coolmore America.\n\nThe vice president, who says he and his wife, Karen, \u201clike to go horseback riding every chance we get,\u201d told members of his party Friday that he accepted an offer to hold American Pharoah\u2019s reins.\n\nThat\u2019s when, Pence says, he was nipped hard.\n\nThe vice president did not mention a bite when he spoke of his visit with American Pharoah later in the day at an event promoting the Trump administration\u2019s tax cut bill.\n\n\u201cI like to be around winners,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nIn 2015, American Pharoah became the 12th-ever winner of the Triple Crown, winning three demanding races for 3-year-old thoroughbred horses spread out over just five weeks. He was the first animal to achieve the honor in nearly 40 years; he\u2019s continued to make headlines since then, breaking records this week as his progeny sold for an eye-popping $8.2 million.\n\nNow, he\u2019s in the news again with Pence\u2019s story.\n\nRead more:\n\nTriple Crown winner Justify reportedly failed a drug test before 2018 Kentucky Derby\n\nTrump encouraged Pence to stay at his golf resort in Ireland\n\nPence\u2019s funny math on Green New Deal, Medicare-for-all costs", "description": "\u201cIf he gave someone a nasty bite, I\u2019d know it,\" the manager said of Triple Crown winner American Pharoah.", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xEc1Dw-ifXeslBbWVKGAV0yT8cM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H7CFPNGWJQI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
