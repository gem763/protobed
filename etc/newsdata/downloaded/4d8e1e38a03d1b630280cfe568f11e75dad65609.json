Police and witnesses say shots were fired in multiple locations, including outside a synagogue and near a Jewish cemetery. The attack came as Jews observed Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement.\n\nOne suspect has been arrested, and another suspect is thought to have fled in a vehicle. Authorities believe two or three people may have carried out the attack.\n\nWitnesses told local media outlets that a man fired shots and threw a grenade-like object at a kebab shop.\n\nMax Privorozki, chairman of the Jewish community in Halle, told news magazine Der Spiegel that a gunman tried to invade a synagogue, firing shots and throwing Molotov cocktails \u2014 but that the building's security measures withstood the attack. About 70 to 80 people were in the synagogue at the time, he said.\n\nRegional broadcaster MDR shared a bystander's cellphone video showing a person wearing a helmet firing shots from a rifle, though it's not clear what the person was shooting at. Shots also were reportedly fired 9 miles away, in the town of Landsberg.\n\nResidents have been told to stay indoors, and police are asking for help in finding any images or video that might show the suspects.\n\nTwo people have been admitted to a hospital in Halle with gunshot wounds and were undergoing surgery, Der Spiegel reported.\n\nPolice protection was increased at synagogues in the eastern German cities of Leipzig and Dresden after the incident, German news service DPA reports. Federal police also reinforced security at train stations and airports in central Germany and on routes to Poland and the Czech Republic. Deutsche Bahn announced that Halle's main train station was closed.\n\nGerman federal prosecutors have taken over the investigation of the case, according to Der Spiegel.\n\nThis is a developing story.
