(Photo: Investigation Discovery)\n\nIn the premiere episode, Gloria Marshall shares her clear memory of giving her daughter Danielle Marshall a final goodbye before she was killed. Danielle was just 23 when she was shot in her Powder Springs, Georgia, home.\n\n\"I remember that day like no other,\" Gloria says on the show of the tragic time. When her daughter requested a goodbye kiss, Gloria jokingly responded her daughter was \"too grown,\" referring to a conversation they had the day before.\n\nWhen Gloria speaks of her regret, a visibly moved Hostin places her hands to her mouth. \"Why didn't I just give her that one kiss?\" Gloria squeaks.\n\nHostin says in such raw moments, \"You take it on and you take it in, and in many ways you learn from it.\"\n\nAs the mother of two children, she says she \"felt that to my core. ... That moment helped me as a mother, thinking 'OK, I\u2019ve got to kiss my kids every, single day.'\"\n\nDanielle Marshall (Photo: Investigation Discovery)\n\nHostin did double duty, hosting \"The View\" on weekdays and taping the documentary series on weekends.\n\n\"There were days we worked 15, 16 hours, sometimes 17 hours and slept a couple of hours and then got back up and then flew somewhere else,\" she says. \"It never felt like work; it just felt great.\"\n\nHostin sees \"Truth about Murder\" as a chance to highlight the experiences of those who don't have access to her platforms. .\n\n\"It\u2019s just part of the same thing that drives me, which is I get to give voice to people,\" she says. \"It\u2019s an awesome responsibility, but it just really lights me up.\"\n\nHer daytime gig also often spurs headlines and even a book about the behind-the-scenes drama. Hostin sees it as par for the course, writing it off as \"just part of the show.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s always been the case that people say that we don\u2019t get along,\" she says. For some viewers, bickering is part of the show's appeal. Hostin speculates the suspicions stem from the co-hosts being \"so strong and all so different and we do It in front of three million people every day.\"\n\nMeghan McCain addresses dangers of body shaming: This 'can lead women to eating disorders'\n\n'This video isn't a joke': Kathy Griffin, Meghan McCain denounce fake violent Trump video\n\n\"View\" co-host Sunny Hostin, center, with Chelsea Clinton, left, and Meghan McCain (Photo: Paula Lobo/ABC)\n\nBut she says it's not true, and compares their conflicts to those experienced in families.\n\n\"I don\u2019t have siblings, but I have cousins that I'm really close to and friends that I\u2019m very close to, and we get into arguments,\" she says. \"And there are times when you walk back into your dressing room and you\u2019re like, 'I cannot believe that she thinks that.' But that\u2019s fine because you\u2019re a family, and you\u2019re going to go to work the very next day and work together as a family.\n\n\"Families have arguments. Families have disagreements. I think the viewers are OK with us getting into disagreements, just like kids understand when their parents get into disagreements. They just don\u2019t want us to get divorced. And we\u2019re not gonna get divorced anytime soon.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/21/the-view-host-sunny-hostin-cohost-true-crime-truth-about-murder/3997967002/", "description": "\"Families have arguments.
