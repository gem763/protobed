At the start, protesters had focused on the narrow issue of gerrymandering in elections to Moscow city council. But over the next few weeks, protests evolved to become the biggest test of Vladimir Putin\u2019s authority since 2012.\n\nThey also became a test of the regime\u2019s hardline resolve: how much it was ready to wage war on its kids.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He found his name on databases, at the job centre; even his orthopaedic consultant had somehow found out about him attending a protest.\n\n\u201cEverywhere I went I was asked who was paying me,\u201d he says. Georgii\u2019s case never moved on to charges. But friends and two dozen others were not so fortunate.\n\nMost of these young men put on trial \u2013 police left the girls alone \u2013 were fringe actors in the protests. In many cases, CCTV recordings indicated defendants were themselves the victims of police brutality. None of it mattered during the often wild sentencing. One man received five years for sending a tweet. Another got four years for the repeated \u201ccrime\u201d of attending an unsanctioned protest.\n\nFollowing public outcry, authorities dropped half a dozen of the most egregious cases. The Kremlin was also famously forced to intervene in the case of 23-year-old actor Pavel Ustinov, imprisoned allegedly resisting arrest. The judge had previously ruled video evidence showing his innocence to be inadmissible. Following street protests, his sentence was commuted.\n\nAlexei Minyailo, 34, an aide to the opposition politician Lyubov Sobol, was one of the men who was released from a criminal investigation.\n\nDismissing the charges against him as \u201cabsurd\u201d \u2013 he was accused of attending a protest he did not attend \u2013 he nonetheless considers the U-turn to be significant. It was reflective of a split among even the most loyal of law enforcement officials, he says.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Not to examine videos to see who might have accidentally brushed against a police officer.\u201d\n\nBy late September, it seemed the operation against protesters was finally being dialled down.\n\nBut then, last week, the arrests resumed.\n\nOn 14 October, two and a half months after the 27 July protest, Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee announced that it was pressing charges against four men for allegedly assaulting police officers. A further two suspects were at large, it added.\n\nOne of the young men to be detained after dawn raids was Andrei Barshai, a 21-year-old physics student.\n\n\u201cAll we can look forward to is fear, desperation and hopelessness.\u201d Yelena Barshai, mother of Andrei Barshai, 21, arrested on 14 October\n\nBarshai had, it appears, made the mistake of putting his skinny body between a truncheon-wielding police officer and a protester, Boris Kantorovich, who was profiled in an earlier Independent article. In the opinion of state prosecutors, his behaviour was considered a violent assault commensurate with up to two years in prison.\n\nHis mother, Yelena Barshai, says there was no way the officer was put in harm\u2019s way, describing her son\u2019s conduct as an \u201cemotional outburst\u201d from a boy with an \u201cacute sense of injustice.\u201d\n\n\u201cAndrei was a good student, with a place at the Moscow Aviation Institute, but now that is all in the past,\u201d she said. \u201cAll we can look forward to is fear, desperation and hopelessness.\u201d\n\nBarshai says she believes authorities had picked on her son to deliver a \u201cdemonstrative rebuke\u201d to Russia\u2019s youngsters.\n\n\u201cIt has been done so young people don\u2019t even think about expressing their dissatisfaction publicly,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are protests now, but that will all die down. The most idealistic and romantic \u2013 like my Andrei \u2013 will be frightened for the rest of their lives.\u201d\n\nOthers suggest that the youngest generation will continue to pose a threat to the Kremlin until it fixes its social and political contract with them.\n\n\u201cUltimately, this is all about stagnation and oxygen,\u201d says Pavel Chikov, a lawyer who has defended many of those accused. \u201cTwenty-something young Russians are looking for ways to realise themselves in politics, professional or civic life, and they are finding there are no such opportunities.\u201d\n\nThe direction of political travel would suggest concessions are unlikely at this stage. But hardliners have also been denied the complete victory they craved.\n\n\u201cPublic mobilisation frustrated hardliners within the State investigative committee and National Guard,\u201d says Chikov. \u201cThey weren\u2019t able to do what they wanted and their position within the elite was compromised as a result.\u201d\n\nThe latest arrests, coming at a time of reduced public interest, was likely an attempt to claw back authority, the lawyer adds.\n\n\u201cThe empire is striking back in whatever way it can.\u201d", "description": "By the end of a summer of interrogations, 19-year-old Georgii\u00a0knew what to expect.\u00a0 The trick, he says, was to look for where the state investigator kept the presidential portrait: if Vladimir Putin was hanging directly above the desk, he was likely in for a difficult time. \u201cThe worst was when the investigator had not only Putin but\u00a0 [Defence Minister Sergei] Shoigu too,\u201d says", "authors": ["Oliver Carroll"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/21/11/title.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
