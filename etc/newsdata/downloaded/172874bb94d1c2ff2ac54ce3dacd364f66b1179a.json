A conventional party leader like McConnell thinks about how to pass legislation through the lens of what is possible inside the constraints of Congress.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very different calculation from talk radio,\u201d Rosenwald said. \u201cTalk radio hosts wake up in the morning and say \u2014 and this goes for cable news hosts as well \u2014 they wake up and say, \u2018What\u2019s the best show I can put on today?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe chief goal, then, for talk radio and cable TV is to entertain, in order to keep listeners and watchers from changing the channel. This distorts their presentation of the news, Rosenwald said, and leads to an oversimplified and reductionist portrayal of events.\n\n\u201cIf you say, \u2018We\u2019ve got to cut a deal to raise the debt ceiling because there\u2019s going to be serious economic consequences if we don\u2019t do this, and you may not like it, it may not come with the things we want, but there\u2019s divided government and the system works this way\u2019 \u2014 I just bored your audience even trying to talk about that,\u201d Rosenwald said.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jon Ward"], "top_image": ""}
