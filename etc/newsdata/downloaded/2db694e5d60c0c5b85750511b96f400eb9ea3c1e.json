They are for everyone.\"\n\nWhile the judges did not generalize their ruling to cover all commercial activity, gay rights advocates warned it sets the stage for further legal battles.\n\n\"This decision opens the door for other bigoted owners to outright discriminate against LGBTQ people for who we are and who we love,\" said Brianna Westbrook, vice-chair of the Arizona Democratic Party, who is transgender.\n\n\"A business owner will now be able to post on their website or place a sign on their front door stating 'heterosexuals only,'\" warned Westbrook.\n\nThe plaintiffs were represented by Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a conservative organization dedicated to challenging similar laws across the US.\n\nIt represented a Colorado pastry chef who refused to bake a cake for a gay wedding in 2012.\n\nThe widely followed and divisive case reached the Supreme Court six years later, which ruled partially in favor of the chef.", "description": "Two Arizona artists who refused to create invitations to same-sex weddings due to their Christian beliefs were within their legal rights, the US state's top court ruled Monday.
