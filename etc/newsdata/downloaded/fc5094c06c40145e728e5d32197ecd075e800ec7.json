Fishing rope was strung through and around the whale's mouth and it was attached to fishing gear, crayfish traps and flotation buoys.\n\n\"In a sensitive and delicate operation lasting two hours, the team gently cut all entangled fishing rope and gear, successfully freeing the adult whale from the entanglement.\n\n\"While the whale appeared to be weak and tired the whale does appear to be healthy following this ordeal. SAWDN is confident that after this successful disentanglement operation, the whale will survive and gradually regain strength and health,\" Lambinon said.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
