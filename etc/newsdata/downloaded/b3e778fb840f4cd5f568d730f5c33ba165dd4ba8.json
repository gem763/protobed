What are the proposals and will they work?\n\nWhat is the government\u2019s plan?\n\nAccording to the plan leaked to the Irish broadcaster RTE, the solution for trade on the Irish border involves customs clearance sites not at the border, but between five and 10 miles from either side of it.\n\nAlternatively HGV drivers and cargo owners could elect to have a tracking device on their vehicle which would be monitored in real time with customs declarations completed online.\n\nLarge scale customs operations rely on a combination of trust and random and intelligence-led checks to ensure that what is in trucks matches what is on the customs declarations forms.\n\nAnything else?\n\nYes, he is also proposing an all-island agri-food zone that would see Northern Ireland align with the EU laws which would apply south of the border. This would protect the dairy trade and that of meat including beef, lamb and chicken. Johnson has claimed this is a very big concession from the UK.\n\nHow is it different from Theresa May\u2019s agreement?\n\nThe former prime minister\u2019s plan involved a backstop policy that would apply across the entire UK including Britain in the event that talks on the future trading relationship broke down. This meant there would be no need for any Northern Ireland-only specific arrangements, no need for any checks anywhere near the border. The withdrawal agreement also involved a complex web of pledges on intangibles that would protect cross-border communities, including legally binding pledges to uphold all aspects of the Good Friday/Belfast agreement which includes a level of ministerial cooperation north/south and east/west.\n\nWill the EU buy it?\n\nThis plan is dead on arrival. Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister dismissed it as a \u201cnon-starter\u201d. In a tweet just before midnight he said it was time that the EU and Ireland had a \u201cserious proposal\u201d.\n\nSimon Coveney (@simoncoveney) Non-Paper = Non-Starter. Time the EU had a serious proposal from the UK Govt if a #Brexit deal is to be achievable in October. NI and IRE deserves better!\n\nWhy is it such a problem?\n\nIt is a big departure from May\u2019s commitment that there would be no infrastructure on the border. It also pays little attention to the unique history and geography around the border, which is 310 miles long with 270 public cross border roads, many closed or cratered by the army during the troubles to stop traffic.\n\nIt would risk the economic activity on both sides of the border and the social cohesion that has been built since the Good Friday/Belfast agreement 21 years ago.\n\nAccording to a parliamentary report 177,000 heavy goods and 208,000 light goods vehicles cross the border every month.\n\nCross border communities warn that checks would not just cause inconvenience but risks dividing communities on each side of the border and shattering new relationships between previously divided communities.\n\nWill it fly with backbenchers?\n\nMany MPs have never engaged with the detail of the Irish border backstop or protocols in the withdrawal agreement on Northern Ireland and look to the Democratic Unionist party for their lead. The DUP has been consulted about the proposals and is likely to be in favour of them ahead of delivery (if this now happens) to Brussels. The eurosceptic European Research Group which includes the 28 so-called Spartans who voted against May\u2019s deal three times, have also softened their opposition to the backstop and indicated they would consider a deal that involved a backstop as long as it meant the UK was \u201cgenuinely\u201d free of all EU rule.", "description": "Plan involves customs clearance sites but Ireland\u2019s deputy PM dismissed it as \u2018non-starter\u2019", "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/231058f3cadea497900a895158df810e77781123/0_165_5090_3054/master/5090.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f2ab1dbf86c3466091eed106475c3215", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
