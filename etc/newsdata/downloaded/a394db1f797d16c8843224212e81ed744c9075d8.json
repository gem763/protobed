Invented by John Bollinger back in the 1980s, Bollinger Bands have become one of the most popular technical indicators today. For the uninitiated, Bollinger Bands consist of a moving average \u201ccenter line,\u201d with upper and lower lines set two standard deviations above and below that line. These bands create a price envelope that follows an instrument\u2019s price up and down over time, expanding and contracting in response to the underlying market\u2019s recent volatility.\n\nMarket volatility tends to be cyclical, meaning that markets alternate between periods of large trending movements and small range-bound trade. When the Bollinger Band Width (the distance between the upper and lower band) contracts, it creates a Bollinger Band \u201csqueeze\u201d setup, suggesting that the market is poised to see a breakout and a return of volatility.\n\nIn \u2019s case, prices have spent the last month consolidating in a tight range, reminiscent of the sideways trade we saw from mid-August to late-September. Similarly, the Bollinger Band Width dropped to just 8%, an abnormally low level (for at least!). With price breaking out of its range after the prolonged contraction in volatility, a strong selloff from here is a distinct possibility:\n\nDaily Bitcoin\n\nSource: Trading View, FOREX.com\n\nWhat To Watch\n\nAs for the key levels to watch, the June low and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of this year\u2019s rally converge in the $7200-$7400 area, so bulls do have a clear area to make their stand. If that potential support area is broken, could quickly fall toward $6,000, likely dragging the broader cryptoasset market down with it.", "description": "Market Analysis by Matthew Weller covering: Facebook Inc, BTC/USD, Investing.com Bitcoin Index.
