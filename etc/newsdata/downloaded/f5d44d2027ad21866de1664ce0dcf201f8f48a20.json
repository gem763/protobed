(She\u2019ll officially be sentenced on September 13.) Per NBC News, though, 27 of Huffman\u2019s friends have written letters of support to the case\u2019s presiding judge for a more lenient sentence, with one of them being Huffman\u2019s former Desperate Housewives co-star and good friend, Eva Longoria.\n\nIn her letter, Longoria writes that Huffman immediately befriended her when they began work on the show \u2014 Longoria was \u201cscared\u201d as she was \u201cnew to the business\u201d \u2014 and Huffman was the only person who stood up for her when an unnamed co-star began bullying her. \u201cThere was a time I was being bullied at work by a co-worker,\u201d Longoria explained. \u201cI dreaded the days I had to work with that person because it was pure torture. Until one day, Felicity told the bully \u2018enough\u2019 and it all stopped. Felicity could feel that I was riddled with anxiety even though I never complained or mentioned the abuse to anyone.\u201d Years later, when Housewives became a critical and ratings success for ABC, Longoria says Huffman spearheaded the idea for the show\u2019s four leads to negotiate a salary contract as an equal unit. (Teri Hatcher and Marcia Cross being the other two.) The tea begins here:\n\n\u201cThis did not go over too well with the others. But Felicity stood up for me, saying it was fair because the success of the show depended on all of us, not one of us. This fight lasted weeks, but Felicity held strong and convinced everyone this was the right thing to do. And thanks to her, I was bumped up to favored nations. It wasn\u2019t about the money for me, it was the fact that I was seen as an equal, which is how Felicity had always seen me.\u201d\n\nLongoria also said that Huffman was the only Housewives co-star who showed any interest in her charity work, despite pleas from Longoria to her co-stars to show up occasionally for fundraising and charity events:\n\n\u201cI knew I couldn\u2019t do it alone so I asked the other women to join me. They were all usually too busy to help, except Felicity. I can\u2019t tell you how many times she was the only one who would physically show up to help me with the kids with cancer, or children with special needs.\u201d\n\nWisteria Lane \u2014 it can change a woman, for better or worse!", "description": "In an open letter, Eva Longeria supported her Desperate Housewives co-star Felicity Huffman amidst the college admissions scandal.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/24/7-eva.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
