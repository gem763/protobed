The hotel is one of only three places that the Iranian leader could go in the city, because of U.S. sanctions. Macron intended to set up a three-way telephone conversation with Rouhani and President Trump. A team of technicians arrived to set up a secure line, in a meeting room on Rouhani\u2019s floor, for the call at 9:30 P.M. The telephone conversation was supposed to cap twenty-four hours of frenetic diplomacy\u2014including personal appeals to Rouhani by the British, Japanese, and Pakistani Prime Ministers and the German Chancellor\u2014after months of quiet French diplomacy.\n\nEarlier in the day, Macron, alongside the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, had urged Rouhani to talk with Trump. Their exchange was caught on video. \u201cIf he leaves the country without meeting President Trump, honestly, this is a lost opportunity,\u201d Macron directed an interpreter to tell Rouhani, amid a scrum of diplomats and photographers. \u201cBecause he will not come back in a few months and President Trump will not go to Tehran.\u201d Rouhani threw his head back and laughed. \u201cSo they have to meet now!\u201d Macron insisted. Johnson chimed in, as cameras flashed, \u201cYou need to be on the side of the swimming pool\u2014and jump at the same time.\u201d\n\nFor decades, timing\u2014the sequencing of diplomacy, and which side takes the plunge first\u2014has derailed attempts to ease hostilities between Washington and Tehran. In 2013, President Obama dove first, during Rouhani\u2019s first visit as President to the U.N. General Assembly. He reached out to Rouhani in a telephone call. The two men never met in person, but the call led, after two years of tortuous diplomacy, to the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and the world\u2019s six major powers. It was widely considered the most significant nonproliferation agreement in the world in more than a quarter century, even as all sides acknowledged its shortcomings. Trump abandoned it in May, 2018.\n\nRouhani, who has staked his Presidency on ending Iran\u2019s tensions with the outside world over its nuclear program, is now a lame duck. The fate of his last major diplomatic gamble will almost surely impact Iran\u2019s parliamentary elections next year and its Presidential election in 2021. In Iran\u2019s deeply polarized politics, the nuclear deal has been as unpopular among the regime\u2019s hard-liners\u2014for concessions made by Iran\u2014as it has been with Trump\u2019s advisers\u2014for concessions made by the United States.\n\nMacron\u2019s mission in New York was to secure a verbal agreement from Trump and Rouhani on a four-point plan to jump-start diplomacy\u2014and to avoid another Middle East war. Tensions have escalated since Trump reimposed sanctions this past November which were designed to cut off Iran\u2019s oil exports. This summer, Iran and the U.S. shot down each other\u2019s drones; Trump called off U.S. military retaliation in the operation\u2019s final minutes. Iran also threatened to cut off oil from other Persian Gulf countries if its main source of revenue were blocked. This month, Washington blamed Tehran for an attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities that temporarily severed five per cent of global oil supplies.\n\nMacron hoped that the telephone conversation would lay the groundwork for the first meeting between an American President and an Iranian President since Tehran\u2019s 1979 revolution. Macron\u2019s four-point plan covers Trump\u2019s demand for an expansion of the central terms and issues in the 2015 nuclear deal. Iran would pledge new talks on permanent restrictions on its nuclear program. The plan also addresses Iran\u2019s demand that the United States lift the sanctions that were reimposed last year. And Tehran would be able to resume oil exports, which have plummeted from 3.2 million barrels per day in 2016 to below half a million barrels this summer. More broadly, the plan also incorporates regional flash points; Iran would help end the five-year war in Yemen and make pledges on security and freedom of navigation throughout the Persian Gulf.\n\nTrump has repeatedly signalled an interest in meeting Iranian leaders. During the previous two U.N. General Assembly meetings, in 2017 and 2018, he has conveyed secret messages, through the French, asking to meet Rouhani. In July, Senator Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican and Trump golf partner, hand-carried an invitation to Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, to visit the White House\u2014that very week. In late August, during the G-7 summit in Biarritz, Trump asked Macron to set up a meeting with Zarif, who was holding talks nearby with French officials. At the U.N. last week, Trump expressed his interest to reporters. \u201cThey\u2019re here, we\u2019re here, but we have not agreed to that yet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they would like to negotiate. And it would certainly make sense.\u201d\n\nThe Iranians, however, don\u2019t trust Trump. Four days before Trump arrived in New York, the Administration added another layer of sanctions, this time on Iran\u2019s Central Bank. \u201cWe\u2019ve never done it at this level,\u201d Trump boasted to reporters, in the Oval Office. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad what\u2019s happening with Iran. It\u2019s going to hell. They are broke, and they could solve the problem very easily.\u201d\n\nThis year, the Trump Administration has imposed at least sixteen new rounds of sanctions on Iran, beyond those reimposed last year. Some are unprecedented\u2014including those against the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, everyone in his office, the entire Revolutionary Guard Corps, and Zarif. The United States has also at least twice launched secret cyberattacks against Iran.\n\nAfter every Trump overture, Rouhani and Zarif have responded that the United States must first publicly promise to lift sanctions. Rouhani said last month that he was not interested in the type of flashy summit that Trump had with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un. \u201cIf someone intends to make it as just a photo op with Rouhani, that is not possible,\u201d Rouhani said, in a televised address. The Iranians also preferred that any encounter include the other signatories of the 2015 pact\u2014Britain, China, France, Germany, and Russia.\n\nTrump\u2019s speech to the U.N. last week didn\u2019t foster trust, either. \u201cNo responsible government should subsidize Iran\u2019s bloodlust,\u201d he declared. \u201cAs long as Iran\u2019s menacing behavior continues, sanctions will not be lifted\u2014they will be tightened. Iran\u2019s leaders will have turned a proud nation into just another cautionary tale of what happens when a ruling class abandons its people and embarks on a crusade for personal power and riches.\u201d The same day, Rudy Giuliani, the President\u2019s personal lawyer, was the keynote speaker at an event organized by the Iranian opposition. \u201cI am for regime change,\u201d he told protesters gathered near the U.N. headquarters. \u201cDown with the tyrants in Iran. Down with the Ayatollah and the mullahs and all the crooks.\u201d\n\nBy the end of Tuesday, Rouhani was in no mood to believe that Trump would take the first step and promise to lift sanctions. When Macron showed up, Rouhani had already retreated to his bedroom. \u201cThis was just a game to get us to a meeting without any assurances that Trump would deliver,\u201d Zarif later told me.\n\nThe call to Trump\u2019s line came through at nine-thirty, according to sources familiar with events that evening. Macron took the call. But Rouhani never emerged from his room. \u201cAs we have been doing for several months, we worked in New York to get Iran to make new commitments and for the U.S., in exchange, to ease sanctions,\u201d a French diplomat told me. \u201cWe made technical arrangements in the event that a telephone call could take place. That call did not take place.\u201d The next day, Trump banned Iranian officials and their families from the United States.", "description": "Robin Wright writes on recent diplomatic developments during the United Nations General Assembly between Donald Trump, Hassan Rouhani, and Emmanuel Macron, and on goals to reaffirm the 2015 nuclear deal and lift sanctions against Iran.", "authors": ["Robin Wright", "David Rohde", "Nora Ephron", "Adam Entous", "Anna Wiener", "Alexandra Schwartz", "Isaac Chotiner"], "top_image": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5d90fad82081ad000891b914/16:9/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/Wright--Rouhani01.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
