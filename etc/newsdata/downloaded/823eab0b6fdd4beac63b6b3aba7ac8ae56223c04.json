Don\u2019t get too excited, though, Steam faithful: you\u2019re still going to need the Origin launcher in order to play your games.\n\nAround 2011, EA shifted gears from Valve\u2019s storefront over to Origin. Jedi: Fallen Order will be the first EA game since that time to release on Steam (you can pre-order it there if you haven\u2019t already). EA will also release some of its single-player games shortly after this, including Sims 4 and Unravel Two. Multiplayer games like Apex Legends, FIFA 20, and Battlefield V will be available next year and will play cross-platform between Origin and Steam. According to Engadget, you\u2019ll even be able to join your friends lists on both platforms at some point.\n\nThis is the first time we\u2019ve seen a subscription service on Steam. Normally, companies restrict them to their own storefronts \u2014 Xbox Game Pass, Uplay+, etc. EA\u2018s already made an effort to expand Access to PlayStation, which received the service earlier this year. Players will have access to a vault with around 80 games, assuming the library on Steam is sized similar to the ones on console and Origin. We\u2019ve contacted EA for clarification.\n\nSo what does this mean for Origin? Well, for starters, it\u2019s still got Origin Access \u2014 don\u2019t worry, this confusing for me too. Origin Access is the subscription service exclusive to the PC storefront, which offers a vault of over 200 games and access to new titles (depending on whether you have the Basic or Premier subscriptions). We\u2019re on record praising Origin Access Premier \u2014 it\u2019s a relative bargain as far as gaming subscriptions go.\n\nAlso, buried in the Jedi: Fallen Order Steam page, you can see the words \u201cDownload & Installation Of The Origin Client Software Required To Play.\u201d So clearly, you\u2019re still going to need Origin in order to boot up your games, which is how Ubisoft games work these days. That\u2019s not exactly ideal \u2014 you\u2019re going to be forced to download the Origin launcher no matter what.\n\nThere\u2019s something else the company could use Origin for: EA\u2018s also been quietly working on its own cloud gaming service (yeah, I know, another one) called Project Atlas. The company\u2019s been working on this for a while \u2014 the initial announcement mentioned \u201can awesome upcoming dynamic world game called Anthem,\u201d which just feels kind of sad now. But putting that aside, I can see why Origin would make a good place for Atlas. Ubisoft managed to make Uplay a vessel for its subscription service without removing its games from Steam, so there\u2019s some precedent for companies retrofitting their personal storefronts for other services.\n\nSo Origin\u2019s sticking around no matter what, but at least gamers who want to consolidate their libraries in future will be able to stick with Steam.\n\nEA and Valve Partnership on EA News\n\nRead next: Review: NBA2K20 is the best RPG I've ever played", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F04%2FStar-Wars-Jedi-Fallen-Order.jpg&signature=1bfcbe081038d09c268a93621bcda65b", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
