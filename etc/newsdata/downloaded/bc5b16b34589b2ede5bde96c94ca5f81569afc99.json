I never told him because I've always been too scared to.\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"After all this time I think I want to tell him. If u give me a sign, I'll hit send. This is a chance I am willing to take.

If you said so, I'll definitely go for it.\n\n\"Thank you so much for your message. I hope your day was good. Goodnight.
