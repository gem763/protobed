In September, local authorities launched demolitions of houses in informal settlements, home to three million Iraqis across the country.\n\nIn response to staggering youth unemployment, which has reached around 25 percent according to the World Bank, the government said it would create large market complexes and boost benefits for those without work.\n\nThe public sector remains the largest employer in Iraq, a country of 40 million people, but it has struggled to absorb new university graduates in recent years.\n\nIn the southern city of Kut last month, a young Iraqi man died after he set himself alight in despair after authorities seized his mobile kiosk.\n\nThe government has officially designated those killed as \"martyrs,\" granting their families a special set of benefits.\n\nThe Iraqi Human Rights Commission said Saturday that 99 people have died and nearly 4,000 have been wounded since protests kicked off.\n\nThe majority of protesters killed were struck by bullets, according to medical sources, who said on Friday that six police officers have also been killed.\n\nThe authorities have accused \"saboteurs\" and unidentified snipers of targeting protesters.\n\nOn Sunday morning, the situation was calm in Baghdad, though with lighter traffic than usual. The capital's iconic Tahrir Square remained blocked off by security forces.\n\nParliament speaker Mohammed al-Halbusi pledged a range of reforms in a meeting with lawmakers on Saturday, but did not hold his planned legislative session as the body failed to reach quorum.\n\nBorn of calls on social media, the protest movement denounced corruption, unemployment and the decay of public services in a country chronically short of electricity and drinking water.\n\nIraq is the 12th most corrupt country in the world, according to Transparency International.\n\nThe protests follow Iraq's declaration of victory over the Islamic State group at the end of 2017 -- after nearly four decades of conflict.\n\nStarting Tuesday, protesters gathered in Baghdad and spread to the country's Shiite-majority south, defying an internet blackout, tear gas and even live rounds.\n\nThe mainly male, young crowds say they are not backed by any political or religious establishment and have attacked a broad range of political party offices.\n\n\"We don't want parties anymore. We don't want anyone to speak in our name,\" one protester told AFP on Friday.\n\nAuthorities have asked protesters to give them time to implement reform.\n\n\"Five days of reported deaths and injuries: this must stop. I call on all parties to pause and reflect,\" the head of the UN mission to Iraq, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, wrote on Twitter.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "The Iraqi government announced a series of reforms early Sunday after an \"extraordinary\" session overnight in response to sweeping anti-government rallies that have left nearly 100 dead in less than a week.
