We are all hypocritical to greater or lesser degrees.\n\n\"But if people like him don't speak out then we all carry on in the same vein and don't even try to change. Its not that bad, eating carrots.\"\n\nHamilton switched to a plant-based diet in 2017 and in September he helped launch a vegan burger restaurant in London.\n\nHe raised fears among the Formula One fraternity on Tuesday after posting worrying social media messages in which he says he feels like \"giving up on everything\".\n\nHe wrote on Instagram : \"Honestly, I feel like giving up on everything. Shut down completely. Why bother when the world is such a mess and people don't seem to care.\n\n\"I'm going to take a moment away to gather my thoughts. Thank you to those of you who do give a damn about the world.\"\n\nHis comments were blasted by some fans on Twitter, with one user highlighting Hamilton's extravagant lifestyle.\n\n(Image: XPB Images/Press Association Images)\n\nHe wrote: \"Lewis Hamilton; Owns a \u00a325 million private jet. Races cars for a living. Has a \u00a313 million car collection. Owns a \u00a33 million yacht.\n\n\"Avoided taxes on his jet using tax avoidance scheme. Sponsored by Petronas, a Malaysian oil and gas company.\"\n\nThe somewhat controversial tweet received over 8,000 likes, while another fan added: \"Don\u2019t forget how his car gets to where the race is held. By plane or boat. Full of diesel, plus generators. So nothing environmentally \u2018perfect\u2019 there.\"", "description": "Lewis Hamilton urged his fans to go vegan and said he feels like \"giving up on everything\" due to his concerns about the environment", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Afp Getty Images", "Xpb Images Press Association Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19116299.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_AUTO-PRIX-F1-BEL-QUALIFYING.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
