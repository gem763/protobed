That means the media has another opportunity to spout nonsense about \u201cassault weapons\u201d, and ABC News has gone all out in an attempt to explain the ban and why it\u2019s no longer on the books (spoiler alert: the law came with an 10-year expiration date and there wasn\u2019t enough political support to renew the ban in 2004).\n\nMost reviews of the 1994 version of the assault weapons ban point to loopholes in the text of the bill that, some argue, made it less effective than some would have wanted. \u2026 The biggest of the various loopholes in the bill was that it only applied to the specified types of weapons and large-capacity magazines that were created after the bill became law, meaning that there was nothing illegal about owning or selling such a weapon or magazine that had been created before the law was signed.\n\nThat\u2019s not a \u201cloophole\u201d, it\u2019s called \u201cgrandfathering\u201d, but it\u2019s telling that ABC News wants its audience to consider the fact that people weren\u2019t criminalized for continuing to own their firearm a \u201cloophole\u201d that should have been closed. This is activism with a press badge, not serious journalism.\n\nABC then continues to show just how much its reporters know about guns by committing an all too common media mistake.\n\nOne of the most-cited studies on the effectiveness of the ban was done in 2004. That federally funded report by the National Institute of Justice at the Department of Justice found that the number of gun crimes involving automatic weapons dropped by 17% in the six cities involved in the study during the ban.\n\nAutomatic weapons, huh? It\u2019s pretty clear ABC reporter Meghan Keneally just read the first couple of pages of the study she cites, and even then, she managed to get her figures wrong. The NIJ didn\u2019t find that \u201cgun crimes involving automatic weapons dropped by 17%\u201d in the six cities that were studied. Here\u2019s what the report actually says on page 2.\n\nFollowing implementation of the ban, the share of gun crimes involving AWs declined by 17% to 72% across the localities examined for this study (Baltimore, Miami, Milwaukee, Boston, St. Louis, and Anchorage), based on data covering all or portions of the 1995-2003 post-ban period. This is consistent with patterns found in national data on guns recovered by police and reported to ATF.\n\nThe truth is one city saw a 17% decline in the share of gun crimes involving \u201cassault weapons\u201d (not automatic weapons as Keneally writes) and one city saw a 72% reduction in the share of gun crimes involving \u201cassault weapons\u201d. That seems like a pretty broad spread, doesn\u2019t it? That\u2019s because these guns aren\u2019t used in a large number of crimes to begin with. If an \u201cassault weapon\u201d was used in 4 crimes in Boston in 1993, for instance, and 2 crimes in 1995, that\u2019s a 50% reduction in the number of crimes in which an \u201cassault weapon\u201d was used. It\u2019s also statistically worthless, because as the NIJ notes, the guns that fell under the Clinton Gun Ban were rarely used in crimes to begin with.\n\nThe reason the gun ban expired in 2004 was that there simply weren\u2019t enough votes to renew it. Politicians remembered the legislative defeats Democrats suffered in 1994 after Clinton signed the bill, and there weren\u2019t too many who were eager to see if voters minds had changed.\n\nThis is just bad reporting on the part of ABC News, and while it\u2019s not surprising to see, it\u2019s still disappointing, and frankly inexcusable.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/127/3eac1236-dacd-4c43-8c55-52a802490000.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
