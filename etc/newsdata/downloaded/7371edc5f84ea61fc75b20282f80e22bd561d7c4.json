The officer, who has not been named, detained the driver until an ICE agent arrived.\n\nRoessler put the officer on leave, saying in a statement released Tuesday that he \u201cviolated our longstanding policy and deprived a person of their freedom, which is unacceptable.\u201d But just one day later, Roessler released a statement saying the department had decided to reinstate the officer.\n\n\u201cWe have one of the best police forces in the U.S. and I have confidence that our officer will represent us well throughout his career,\u201d Roessler said in the statement. \u201cOur internal administrative investigation continues as prescribed by policy.\u201d\n\nFriday was the officer\u2019s first day back on the job. When contacted for comment, the Fairfax County Police Department referred VICE News to Roessler\u2019s published statement.\n\nFairfax County police have been prohibited from holding people who aren\u2019t already in its custody for ICE since 2007, according to Roessler\u2019s statement. Police departments and sheriffs offices across the country have similarly limited their cooperation with ICE in recent years, and several local law enforcement offices are currently debating over whether they should do the same.\n\nICE released the driver with an ankle monitor after three hours, Roessler\u2019s statement also said.\n\nCover: In this Nov. 16, 2018, file photo, an immigrant who entered the United States illegally is checked before boarding a deportation flight to El Salvador by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Houston.
