They are using lessons from the Arab Spring, maintaining a focus on reforms and trying to avoid the pitfalls that turned hopeful uprisings in Syria, Libya and Yemen into civil wars.\n\n\u201cWhat we are witnessing in the Arab world right now is a continuation of the Arab Spring of 2011,\u201d said Lina Khatib, head of the Middle East and North Africa Program at Chatham House, an independent think tank in London. \u201cWhat unites the popular protests all over the region is that people have broken the wall of fear.\u201d\n\nLebanese protesters in Beirut watched as Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri said he\u2019d step down on Tuesday.

Mr. Hariri follows longtime leaders in Algeria and Sudan who were pushed from power this year.\n\nNow at risk is Iraq Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi, who is rapidly losing political support after his security forces used live ammunition, tear gas and rubber bullets to crack down on nationwide protests, leaving more than 200 people dead.\n\nWhile demonstrators across the region are facing different obstacles as they push for unique demands, especially economic ones, the new protests have brought together people who are typically divided by religion, ethnicity and wealth, particularly in Lebanon.\n\nThe mood on the streets of Beirut is reminiscent of the jubilation that swept through the Arab world in 2011 as autocratic leaders in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen were forced from power. But the Arab Spring celebrations soon gave way to the instability of what has been called the Arab Winter.\n\nLebanese antigovernment protesters celebrated Mr. Hariri\u2019s resignation.

The whole region is still undergoing an awakening because political transformations are not linear.\u201d\n\nNowhere is that more evident than Egypt, where massive Arab Spring-era protests ended President Hosni Mubarak\u2019s 30-year rule. Years of unrest followed as Egypt elected a polarizing president, Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed Morsi, who was ousted by the military in a 2013 coup and replaced by Gen. Abdel Fattah Al Sisi. Since then, Mr. Sisi has tightened his grip on power and is now cracking down on a wave of antigovernment protests by detaining thousands of people, some of whom say they were tortured.\n\nWhile the Arab Spring was largely defined by efforts to topple authoritarian rulers who used fear and intimidation to retain their grip on power, the continuing protests in Lebanon and Iraq are focused on demands for an end to endemic political corruption that has eroded confidence in their elected leaders.\n\nIn Lebanon, protests were triggered by a tax on WhatsApp calls but was seen as emblematic of economic mismanagement, dovetailing with frustration with the government\u2019s inability to contain its biggest wildfires in decades.\n\nRelated Video Lebanon's Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned after nearly two weeks of mass protests across the country.

Lebanon is defined by a tenuous power-sharing system that has divided key posts among Christian, Sunni Muslim and Shiite Muslim groups for decades.\n\nThe regional protests pose a challenge for President Trump, who has tried, with limited success, to disengage from the Middle East. He has repeatedly tried to pull all U.S. forces out of Syria, but then backtracked after allies and U.S. politicians criticized him for eroding American influence in the region. He has railed against \u201cendless wars\u201d in the Middle East, but sent more troops to Saudi Arabia to counter Iran\u2019s influence.\n\nDuring the Arab Spring, the Obama administration struggled to craft a coherent approach to the demonstrations, while using different tools to pressure autocrats in Egypt, Syria and Libya to leave.\n\nAlgerians protested in the streets of the capital Algiers on Tuesday.

But his political support is eroding, and the violent crackdown appears to have backfired. Some government officials consider Mr. Mahdi\u2019s resignation as inevitable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of if, but rather when and how,\u201d said an Iraqi official.\n\nTens of thousands of Iraqis waving national flags thronged Tahrir Square on Wednesday, ignoring a government curfew. Security forces fired tear gas at protesters attempting to breach the barriers on the bridge that leads from Tahrir Square to the Green Zone where many government offices and diplomatic missions are based.\n\nIraqi protesters waved national flags on Tuesday atop concrete barriers across the capital Baghdad\u2019s al-Jumhuriya bridge, which connects Tahrir Square to the high-security Green Zone.

Despite the violence, activists have sought to replicate the festive atmosphere of demonstrations in Lebanon with dance and music, including embrace of the unlikely children\u2019s tune \u201cBaby Shark\u201d as an anthem.\n\nThe regional protests have also posed challenges for another power broker in the Middle East: Iran.\n\nThe U.S. and Israel are working together with Saudi Arabia and other allies in the region to contain Iran\u2019s influence. But street protests in Iraq and Lebanon suggest that popular anger might more effectively blunt Tehran\u2019s power.\n\nDemonstrators in both countries have spoken out against Iran during protests, defying pressure from Tehran. In Lebanon, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah urged people to support the government, which includes members of his Iran-backed movement. When protesters openly disregarded his appeals, Hezbollah supporters armed with sticks attacked demonstrators in downtown Beirut.\n\nOn Wednesday, Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei framed the protests in Iraq and Lebanon as tools of its enemies, including the U.S. and Israel.\n\n\u201cThe people have justifiable demands,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cBut they should know their demands can only be fulfilled within the legal structure and framework of their country. When the legal structure is disrupted in a country, no action can be carried out.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, center, attended a ceremony in Tehran on Wednesday.
