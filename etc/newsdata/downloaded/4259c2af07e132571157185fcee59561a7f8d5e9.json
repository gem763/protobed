She was detained along with her fianc\u00e9, her doctor, his anesthesiologist and his secretary. Her doctor was compelled to hand over her medical records while Ms. Raissouni was forced to undergo a medical examination and to answer questions about her sex life.\n\nMs. Raissouni, a 28-year-old journalist from a politically active family, is now on trial for having an abortion and for having sex outside of marriage. Both are crimes under Morocco\u2019s penal code, and she faces up to two years in jail; her doctor also faces jail time. Ms. Raissouni\u2019s defense maintains that there was no abortion and that the medical reports presented by the prosecution are false.\n\nWhat\u2019s surprising about this arrest is that even though abortions are illegal in Morocco, they are quite common \u2014 and rarely prosecuted. A nongovernmental organization that wants to raise awareness about the risks of clandestine abortions in the country estimates that between 600 and 800 abortions take place every day. There were 73 prosecutions last year.\n\nMs. Raissouni\u2019s unexpected arrest suggests she was targeted because of her profession and her relations . And it shows how vulnerable everyone is when morality is policed arbitrarily by an autocratic state, which can choose to expose the \u201cindecency\u201d of some people\u2019s lives but not others. Those targeted will always tend to be the most powerless, or the most troublesome to the authorities.", "description": "Laws that criminalize \u201cimmoral\u201d behavior in Morocco and elsewhere aren\u2019t about ethics.
