The Trump tax bill offers tax breaks to developers who \u201cinvest\u201d in those communities. Developers can either defer paying or pay no taxes on the developments they build depending on how long they are invested in the neighborhoods.\n\nThe idea is that new investment will help create jobs in neighborhoods that need economic growth.\n\nBut there are no requirements on what these investments look like, and no requirements on who these developers invest in. The people who benefit from the preferential tax treatment don\u2019t need to live, work, or have a business in the opportunity zone. They can come in, build new housing developments or businesses that local residents can\u2019t afford, get their tax break, and leave.\n\nThese tax breaks overwhelmingly benefit wealthy people or corporations \u2014 those who have the money to invest, to begin with.\n\nIn fact, studies of similar programs found that instead of creating new jobs, jobs were just moved from place to place, and very few new ones were created. Analysis after analysis shows that this program will not spur useful economic growth, but instead incentivize gentrification.\n\nMany of these zones do not foster development that is meant to fuel economic growth for the communities they inhabit.\n\nIn Houston, Texas \u2014 where more than one in five people live in poverty \u2014 this program has given rise to the construction of a 46-story, glass-wrapped apartment tower, where amenities will include a yoga lawn and a pool surrounded by cabanas and daybeds. This is the very city where two-thirds of the neighborhoods vulnerable to gentrification are located within opportunity zones.\n\nIn Washington, D.C. \u2014 my home of 11 years and the city with the highest intensity of gentrifying neighborhoods \u2014 I have watched the block-by-block takeover by developers who seek a tax break and want to make a profit by any means necessary.\n\nThe rationale supporting opportunity zones has proliferated for decades under both Democratic and Republican leadership. Though sometimes referred to by other names like \u201cempowerment zones\u201d or \u201cpromise zones,\u201d the underlying thinking remains the same.\n\nIncentivizing corporations and developers to buy up entire street blocks and build condominiums in working-class communities has drastically worsened race and class disparities across the country.\n\nOpportunity zones continue the trend of incentivizing wealthy white people to return to the very neighborhoods they fled in the \u201880s and \u201890s because they were \u201ctoo\u201d black.\n\nSuch programs allow private equity firms, some of which have partners in Trump\u2019s inner circle, to have an outsized influence over how growth and development happens in towns that had previously been cared for by people of color.\n\nReal opportunity zones would invest in local schools, community-centered infrastructure projects, and jobs and skills training \u2014 not line the pockets of Trump\u2019s developer cronies at the expense of everyday workers.\n\nEconomic forecasts show another recession looming, and once again it\u2019ll be working people left holding the bag. The real opportunity our communities need is a tax code that allows the American dream to be within reach for all of us.\n\nWe deserve a fair and equitable economy, not another false promise of \u201copportunity\u201d that actually just displaces us from our neighborhoods and hands them over to wealthy developers. It\u2019s up to all of us to protect the sanctity of our communities from being steamrolled to make way for glass high-rise buildings and dog parks.", "description": "The opportunity zone tax break are not fostering the kind of development that poor neighborhoods need.", "authors": ["Angela Peoples"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS708_opport_ZG_20191004145941.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
