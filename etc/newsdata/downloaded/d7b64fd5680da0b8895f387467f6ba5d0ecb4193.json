They were going to give them a chance. But they haven\u2019t just taken that chance, they look like proper, top players.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re thinking, in two or three years\u2019 time, this could be really special. A team with homegrown players. You think of what Manchester United did all those years ago.\n\nChelsea\u2019s young guns are firing at Stamford Bridge (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018But there\u2019s no doubt, over the next few years, that will have to be supplemented with superstars to challenge for the league again. I don\u2019t see them challenging this season.\n\n\u2018If they finish in the top four this season, Frank Lampard has done a brilliant job. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they picked up a cup competition. It really does look like exciting times.\u2019\n\nThe former Liverpool and England defender added: \u2018The brilliant thing is, the supporters are loving it.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018Even at the start of the season, when they were having a few iffy results, everyone was still behind it, because they hadn\u2019t seen this before \u2013 young players coming through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018So that helped Frank. He always had the support of the crowd and the media, because they couldn\u2019t buy a player, so he was always going to get that little bit longer.\n\n\u2018From a Liverpool point of view, you\u2019re thinking, what a result that was, going to Chelsea and winning. You wouldn\u2019t want to go to Chelsea now.\n\n\u2018We mustn\u2019t forget, they lost the best attacker, in Hazard, they\u2019ve been without their best midfielder, in N\u2019Golo Kante \u2013 he\u2019s hardly played \u2013 and their best defender is Antonio Rudiger, and he\u2019s barely played.\n\n\u2018Think how strong they will be when those players return. One experienced centre-back alongside a young one. Kante, who is as good as any midfielder in the world.\n\n\u2018Get those two back and I\u2019m pretty confident they will finish in the top four.\u2019\n\nMORE: Neville and Carragher react to shocking outburst from Arsenal captain Granit Xhaka", "description": "Jamie Carragher says he is 'pretty confident' Chelsea will secure a top-four finish in the Premier League this season.
