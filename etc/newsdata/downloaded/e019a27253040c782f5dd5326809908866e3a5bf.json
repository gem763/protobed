Gage recently opened its first Michigan medical marijuana dispensary this week and previously licensed its brand for use in Ontario, Canada through a Canopy Growth partially-owned subsidiary. Michigan is still preparing for the rollout of licensed recreational marijuana sales, expected in 2020, after voters made it the 10th U.S. state to legalize.\n\nOusted Canopy Growth co-founder Bruce Linton is getting back into the cannabis space with Gage Cannabis.

Additionally, Linton announced a new special advisor role with animal health and wellness CBD micro-cap Better Choice Company (BTTR).\n\n\u201cThe way I selected the companies was not how much equity they would give me. I turned down the most self-enriching offers,\u201d Linton said. \u201cHowever to be transparent, all firms provided me with generous equity exposure. With each firm and space, I sought to develop a specific view of how we build enterprise value from the current activities and limit disruption.\u201d\n\nLinton also added that another precondition of working with each company would be that all key insiders generally lock up shares for the next 12 months to ensure alignment on a longer-term mission. That was perhaps a valuable learned lesson from his experience at Canopy, with the board growing impatient with short-term improvements to profitability.\n\nActivist investing\n\nThe new role with Gage, however, shouldn\u2019t necessarily come as a surprise, given its prior connection with Canopy Growth. On top of that, the company also recently locked up a newly minted exclusive partnership in Michigan with marijuana startup Cookies, a brand Linton specifically complimented as an industry standout during his last interview with Yahoo Finance.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve done a great job on their [merchandise,]\u201d he said back in August about Cookies, founded by California-based rapper Berner. \u201cIt has been one of those ones that has been my biggest surprise in the last month.\u201d\n\nGage, which was founded in 2017, plans to dedicate \u201csignificant shelf space\u201d to Cookies-branded products at its 13 planned medical marijuana facilities in the state, including one on Detroit\u2019s famed 8 Mile Road.\n\nAside from the more hands-on positions, Linton also said he\u2019d become an activist investor in Slang Worldwide, which sells products in 12 U.S. states, and DNA Genetics, a company that specializes in breeding and cultivating cannabis strains.\n\nLinton is slated to discuss all of his new endeavors and the state of the cannabis industry during a Tuesday interview with Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi PM at 1 p.m. ET.\n\nZack Guzman is the host of YFi PM as well as a senior writer and on-air reporter covering entrepreneurship, cannabis, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.
