One of the all-time most recognisable American sports cars and notorious scene-stealers in the history of cinema. But even as its supercharged versions, the Z06 and ZR1, continue to crank up the horsepower, the \u2018Vette hasn\u2019t quite slipped its way into the same class as the high-priced, high-speed supercars offered by automakers like Ferrari, Lamborghini, or McLaren. That is, until now. For the 2020 model, Chevrolet may have finally closed the gap with one crucial design change. And it\u2019s created an entirely new car that can definitely hang in the big leagues.\n\nSince its introduction in 1953, the Chevy Corvette has undergone a number of changes, gradually transforming from a slick street cruiser into a high-powered race car. In recent years the car has even ventured into supercar territory with its high-performance Z06 models that gave luxury sports car owners a run for their money. For crying out loud, the 2019 ZR1 packed a 755 horsepower engine under its hood.\n\nHowever, the Corvette\u2019s current design was holding it back from performing at its full potential. So the automaker\u2019s team went back to the drawing board and completely redesigned its iconic sports car. The company finally took the plunge and gave its fans a \u201cmid-engine\u201d Corvette.\n\nSo what\u2019s a \u201cmid-engine\u201d car. It\u2019s actually quite simple. It just means that instead of the engine sitting at the front of the car under the hood, it sits in the middle of the car, typically in the space right behind the driver. It\u2019s a layout found in some of the most popular exotic supercars because of how much it can improve a vehicle\u2019s performance.\n\nSo how exactly does a mid-engine design result in better performance? First of all, it improves the car\u2019s handling and braking. When the engine is placed in the middle, its weight is more evenly distributed between the front and rear wheels, allowing the vehicle to change direction more easily and rapidly. In a rear-wheel drive car, like the new Corvette, this added weight to the rear also increases traction and lets the rear brakes do more of the stopping.\n\nA mid-engine design can also provide a boost in acceleration. Generally speaking, adding horsepower and torque to an engine means increasing its mass as well. However, in a rear-wheel drive vehicle, if that hefty engine is sitting on top of your front axle putting far less weight on the wheels all your power is coming from, there\u2019s only so much faster you can make your car go.This is exactly what happened to Chevrolet with its monstrous Corvette ZR1, despite its beast of an engine, wasn\u2019t performing much better than its previous generation models. The solution? Finally slide that engine back and see what this baby can do.\n\nBut a mid-engine Corvette wasn\u2019t some brand-new foreign concept. In fact, Chevy has been testing it since the 1960\u2019s with its series of Chevrolet Experimental Research Vehicles. However, these prototypes remained concept cars because of issues with engine cooling, their limited passenger and luggage space, and an overall unbearable loudness. Fast forward to 2019, and advancements in engineering have finally given us a mid-engine Corvette that many have already labelled a supercar due to its comparable design and performance to a number of exotics.\n\nSo what does this mean for those luxury automakers selling high-performance cars for hundreds of thousands of dollars? It could spell trouble. Let\u2019s take a look at Ferrari. One of the Italian company\u2019s popular choices is the 458 Italia, a mid-engine supercar it produced from 2010 to 2015. As holder of the last naturally aspirated V8 engine Ferrari produced, the car remains a favourite, particularly with purists who despise its turbocharged successors.\n\nNow, a quick look and you\u2019ll see that the new Corvette\u2019s base model and Ferrari 458 are extremely similar both mechanically and performance wise. The real difference? Price. At its release, the 2015 458 started at a cost of about $US240,000. The 2020 Corvette? Try just under $US60,000.\n\nWhile the next-generation Corvette appears to be a Ferrari cousin with the lavish addition of modern tech throughout the interior, there are still plenty of questions about the car that will only be answered when it hits showrooms at the end of this year. But whether you\u2019re a traditionalist unhappy about the Corvette\u2019s complete reconstruction, or can\u2019t wait to get your hands on an exotic supercar for a fraction of the price, there\u2019s no arguing that the leap of faith Chevrolet has taken with its legendary \u2018Vette is the most radical change to happen in the American car industry in a long long time.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
