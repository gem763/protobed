Looking at the sharemarket, its research shows responsible investments have outperformed 'traditional\u2019 Australian sharemarket portfolios for over a decade.\n\nThe industry has also anecdotally found that startups that are impact-led find it easier to hire and retain talent, find it easier to sell to both businesses and consumers, and are also potentially eligible for other funding mechanisms to assist their growth such as government grants.\n\nAside from the returns and other company building perks, there are a few other reasons that may be the trigger for an impact-focused shift in venture capital. VCs also have a mandate to attract the best deals to the table. Many incredible startups are founded by millennials who have grown up with a mindset around using their work to impact the world - and they want to work with like-minded investors.\n\nThere\u2019s also the funds\u2019 own talent to consider. Much like startups, VCs are in their own talent war for analysts and advisors who can help them spot the best deals. I personally chose to work at Giant Leap because of its focus on impact. I know others in the industry feel the same way.\n\nWhile this trend is growing, and is really taking root in Australia, it\u2019s not universally the case. Not everyone is chasing impact with their deals.\n\nThe clearest opposition to this trend comes in the form of a new US VC firm set up to capitalise by countering the impact movement. Launched last June, Vice Ventures is a $US25 million VC seed fund dedicated to investing in companies built around alcohol, gambling and tobacco \u2013 companies that have the potential to destroy people's lives.\n\nThe most logical argument here is that the mainstream rise of impact-related investment both in VC and at an institutional level has made room for these funds and contrary deals.\n\nWe see this as a fringe trend, and given the attitudes of most Australians, we believe it won\u2019t take root here.\n\nOur advice for founders also noticing is that if you\u2019re passionate about a world issue and are using your business to solve it, don\u2019t feel you have to hide this from your investors.\n\nNot all of them will be interested or care. A shrinking number of them may still see it as a disincentive to invest. But you will be surprised by the support you\u2019ll receive from the VC community here if you have a genuine goal to change the world for the better.\n\nRachel Yang is the investment manager of the Giant Leap Fund.", "description": "When Square Peg invested in Amber Electric this month, it chose to highlight the company's mission, not the founders or the scalability of the business.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3544%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_380%2C$y_118/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/010379b3335922a437c49870a85cbd4575d4fd4a", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
