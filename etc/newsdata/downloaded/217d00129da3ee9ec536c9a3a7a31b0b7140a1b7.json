Authorities say they have killed several militants in gun battles and intercepted weapons.\n\nAuthorities on Thursday also released three low-ranking politicians who along with hundreds of other local lawmakers, activists and others have been detained since August 5.\n\nThose still in detention include three former Kashmir chief ministers: Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti.\n\nFarooq Abdullah, 81, was formerly arrested in mid-September under a law allowing him to be held for up to two years without charge that has been widely used, and criticised, in Kashmir.\n\nMore than 250 people have been sent to jails outside Jammu and Kashmir, the Press Trust of India news agency reported.\n\nUN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said last month she was \"deeply concerned\" while Washington has called for a \"rapid\" lifting of restrictions.\n\nThe issue has clouded preparations for a two-day \"informal summit\" between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping beginning in India on Friday.\n\nIndia's August move to split Jammu and Kashmir state in two irked China because it will make the Ladakh region -- claimed in part by Beijing -- of the state a separate administrative territory.\n\nChina has given diplomatic backing to Pakistan, while part of its Belt and Road infrastructure initiative passes through Pakistan-administered Kashmir, which is claimed by India.", "description": "India lifted on Thursday restrictions on tourists visiting Kashmir, but for hotels around the picturesque lake in Srinagar two months into a lockdown it was still far from business as usual.
