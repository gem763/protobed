(AP) - A Colorado Springs balloon festival has grounded a pilot for briefly touching down in a lake that was off-limits because of a harmful algae.\n\nThe Gazette reports the pilot dipped his balloon\u2019s basket into Prospect Lake on Sunday before quickly lifting off again, a maneuver called a \u201csplash and dash.\u201d\n\nAll the pilots in the festival were told not to touch down in the lake because of the presence of blue-green algae, which can be fatal to dogs and make humans sick. The city has banned anyone from wading, swimming, boating and paddle boarding in the lake.\n\nScott Appelman, director of the Labor Day Liftoff festival, says he disqualified the pilot from flying in the event on Monday.\n\nAppelman said he witnessed the incident. He declined to identify the pilot.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Gazette, http://www.gazette.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Colorado Springs balloon festival has grounded a pilot for briefly touching down in a lake that was off-limits because of a harmful algae.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-assets.washtimes.com/images/favicon.30333d68dff6.ico"}
