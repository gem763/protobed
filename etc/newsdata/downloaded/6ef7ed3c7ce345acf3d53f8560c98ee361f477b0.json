That's why reports from our community are still incredibly important,\" he said.", "description": "Campaign group accuses Facebook of failing to rein in hate speech inflaming ethnic tensions in India's Assam.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/30/774ffab9c9cf447c9e9fe6e5fc770ec3_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
