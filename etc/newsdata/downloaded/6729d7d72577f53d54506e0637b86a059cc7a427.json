She added that Weinstein was \u201cnow studying taking legal action\u201d against Chiu for breaking a nondisclosure agreement.\n\n\u201cAs for Mr. Reiter, we know that he has his own dark reasons for sabotaging Mr. Weinstein and the company,\u201d Rotunno added.\n\nWeinstein, 67, is scheduled to go to trial in January on charges alleging he raped an unidentified woman in his Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and performed a forcible sex act on a different woman in 2006.\n\nAmong other things, \u201cShe Said\u201d details how Weinstein\u2019s brother and business partner, Bob Weinstein, tried to convince him to get help two years before he was engulfed by the firestorm of allegations.\n\nIt includes a previously unreported letter Bob Weinstein wrote in 2015 in which he told his brother he had \u201cbrought shame to the family.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour reaction was once more to blame the victims, or to minimize the misbehavior in various ways. If you think nothing is wrong with your misbehavior so in this area then announce it to your wife and family,\u201d Bob Weinstein wrote in the memo.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A new book by The New York Times reporters who uncovered sexual misconduct accusations against Harvey Weinstein reveals the identities of some of the whistleblowers who aided their investigation and includes new details on the movie mogul's attempts to persuade the newspaper not to publish the story.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael R.
