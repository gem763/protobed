This is a perfect way to make a change.\u201d\n\nThe plant-based burger craze went viral when Burger King introduced its \u201cImpossible Whopper\u201d on Aug. 8, with upwards of 45 of the meat-free burgers being sold at Burger King locations a day, according to analyst Andrew Charles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeeking to capitalize on the concept\u2019s growing popularity amongst consumers, Hamilton and company are also planning a U.S. location to launch sometime next year, with the intention of opening 14 more Neat Burger locations around Europe throughout the next two years.\n\nHamilton, a native of the U.K. and the richest sportsman in the entire country with a net worth of \u00a3187 million, became a vegetarian back in 2017. The five-time Formula 1 World Champion now holds a sizeable stake in the company.\n\nThe vegan and vegetarian food market has exploded over the years, with the amount of vegans in the U.K. climbing from 150,000 in 2014 to over 600,000 in 2018, the Vegan Society reports.\n\nHamilton is hardly the only sports figure or celebrity to get into the plant-based burger game, as Jay-Z, Trevor Noah, Serena Williams and Katy Perry are investing in Impossible Foods while the market for meatless burgers continues to grow worldwide.\n\nBurger King has led the recent market expansion of plant-based burgers, and the payoff has been hard to ignore for competitors, with the Impossible Whopper predicted to contribute 6% to same-store sales growth at U.S. Burger Kings this quarter, according to the market research and investment firm Cowen.\n\n\u201cOur 6% same-store sales estimate for 3Q implies instances of one-time consumer trial for Impossible Whopper is sustained, and arguably offset, by awareness that continues to grow with Burger King using TV advertising to promote the innovation,\u201d Charles said in a statement released last Thursday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Five-time Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton, the richest sportsperson in the U.K., is investing in the plant-based burger business following the growing popularity of the Impossible Whopper.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/Lewis-Hamilton-1-Reuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
