Harmonic patterns are correction patterns and not reversal patterns. Any position must be taken after a thorough research.\n\nVolatility is imminent in the coming days with Brexit events, Syrian-Kurdish conflict, and US-China trade war continuations, therefore, caution have to be taken while trading. Below are chart projections of Harmonic patterns (ABCD to be precise) that forecast some small inflection points along the way. Profits can be taken when prices react from the below grey box (Potential Reversal Zone) and retrace 38.2% from the beginning of the pattern.\n\n1. : Following a perfect 0.618/1.618, the pair is likely to find resistance around the grey box with the RSI approaching its resistance levels as well.\n\nAUDUSD H3\n\n2. : Consolidation is expected following the intermediate ABCD pattern inside the bigger pattern. The RSI is also showing a good resistance level from where a nice short can be initiated.\n\nEURUSD H3\n\n3. : The pair is showing a confluence of two ABCD patterns at around 1.3075 that provides a good bullish opportunity.\n\nUSDCAD H3\n\n4. : This is probably my favourite one with an imminent ABCD pattern and bullish signal on the RSI.\n\nUSDCHF H3\n\n5. : A far yet not so far short opportunity on the USDJPY is established following a 0.500/2.000 ABCD. Caution has to be taken with this pair as it tends to react violently to major political events (risk-on / risk-off)\n\nUSDJPY H3\n\nIn conclusion, it is always better to not initiate a trade than to initiate one and regret it. Fundamental events are huge these days and they impact markets severely, the best thing to do is to be well prepared and not rely on one type of analysis.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Sofien Kaabar covering: EUR/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CHF, AUD/USD.
