Democrats have responded by calling to nationalize health care under a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d system. Yet this policy would not address the fundamental health care cost drivers. It simply would transfer costs to taxpayers while introducing rationing in an attempt to control them.\n\nOur research tells us there are better alternatives, ones that harness the same market forces of choice, competition, and transparency that keep prices low in nearly all other sectors of the economy. These are proposals that eliminate the cronyism, backroom deals, and hidden contracts that artificially inflate costs, and that preserve and expand choice and the important relationship between doctors and patients.\n\nOne such reform framework is the \u201cHealth Care for You\u201d plan which our organizations, the Job Creators Network and the Goodman Institute for Public Policy Research, are promoting. It was developed from extensive market research into demonstrated patient preference. It draws on inputs of more than 25,000 patients, doctors, and health care professionals to determine what stakeholders instead of politicians want from a health care plan.
