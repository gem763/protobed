The acceleration of inflation in the United States may prompt the Fed to report a limited space for lower interest rates in the future.\n\nAccording to CME Group, investors estimate the likelihood of another rate cut this year (after lowering it on Wednesday) at 58% against 93% a month ago.\n\nIf the leaders of the central bank nevertheless signal the next rate cut this year, the US stock market will receive a powerful incentive for further growth, and the dollar may drop sharply.\n\nOtherwise (if the Fed reduces the rate by 0.25%, but does not give a signal about a further reduction in the rate), the dollar, after a short-term reduction, may go on to increase.\n\nThe decision on the rate will be published today at 18:00, and the Fed press conference will begin at 18:30 (GMT).\n\nSupport Levels: 1.3258, 1.3245, 1.3238, 1.3233, 1.3182, 1.3138, 1.3020, 1.2975, 1.2880\n\nResistance Levels: 1.3300, 1.3345, 1.3435, 1.3452, 1.3465, 1.3520, 1.3560, 1.3600, 1.3660\n\nTrading Scenarios\n\nSell \u200b\u200bStop 1.3230.
