However, there was only one bid.\n\nMs Richards, known as \"The Wedding Queen of the West,\" eventually decided the show must go on, and placed her retirement plans on hold.\n\nShe told The Telegraph: \"This is where I belong. As long as I can stand up and say 'We are gathered here today to join you in holy matrimony' then I will do it.\n\n\"I love the people that come here to get married. And I love doing whatever will make them happy and remember their wedding day.\n\nIf I couldn't do that any more I would feel I had neglected somebody. Oh gosh, what would I do if I wasn't here? I'd be lonely.\"\n\nThe decline of the Las Vegas wedding industry began before 2008, but the financial crisis exacerbated it, and it has cast a long shadow.\n\nAt the Clark County marriage licence bureau in downtown Las Vegas, the queues are less than they used to be. Couples have to appear in person at the bureau, pay $77, and present a picture ID, before they head to a wedding chapel.\n\nLynn Goya, the clerk of Clark County, told The Sunday Telegraph: \"The recession hit us hard. The main demographic is millennials. We have seen a lot of millennials delay getting married. Like every generation they want a bit of financial stability before they jump into that wonderful pool, marriage, a house and so on.\n\n\"People are saying everyone's going to Hawaii now. But you do have to put that in perspective. They had 17,000 [weddings] last year. We're still outperforming everyone else, just not by as many multiples as before.\"\n\nAlmost five per cent of all marriages in the US still take place around the Las Vegas Strip, where numerous other chapels also operate.\n\nThe industry is working together to attract more couples, including promotional activities in the UK, one of the main overseas markets. Around 3,500 Las Vegas weddings involved British people last year.\n\nThey are also making it even easier to get married. Couples in China can now fill in the forms online. Hi-tech developments like live internet streaming of ceremonies, and potentially virtual reality, are new frontiers. Some chapels are translating their websites into different languages.\n\nAnd, while A Little White Wedding Chapel is the classic template, many others on the Strip are offering increasingly bizarre gimmicks to drum up business, like the minister emerging from a coffin, ceremonies on a roller coaster, and \"shotgun weddings\" where the happy couple fire AK-47s.", "description": "It is perhaps the most famous wedding venue in the world, where eloping desperados, and celebrities including Britney Spears, Frank Sinatra, and Joan Collins, have all tied the knot.", "authors": ["Nick Allen", "Tim Stanley", "Dame Eleanor Laing", "Daniel Hannan", "Juliet Samuel"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/19/TELEMMGLPICT000213293149-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqe5jTtuvhyhg4PHi86V8a0p815QE7DqplUJlHpAWoYtg.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
