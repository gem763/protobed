The index closed down 0.3% to 7306.26 on Tuesday. The British pound GBPUSD, +0.1477% was up 0.2% to $1.2890.\n\nSome investors were sticking to the sidelines ahead of the outcome of a Federal Reserve meeting later, with an interest-rate cut widely expected.\n\nTuesday\u2019s news that the U.K. will hold a general election on Dec. 12 continued to leave investors unmoved. \u201cWhether this reduces the level of uncertainty for holders of UK assets, or further increases the range of possible outcomes, is a judgement call,\u201d said Ian Williams, economics and strategy research analyst at Peel Hunt, in a note to clients.\n\nNext shares NXT, -3.21% slid 3%, making for the worst-performing company in London, after the high-street retailer said sales for the third quarter grew slightly ahead of guidance as it backed its full-year outlook. But sales at physical stores slid 6.3% for the quarter ended Oct. 26.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see how the Brexit delay and forthcoming general election affects consumer confidence. Next arguably needs people to feel good about their finances in order to spend money and any concerns about the economy, job safety and personal finances would naturally have a negative impact on retail spending,\u201d said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, in a note to clients.\n\nOn the upside, Standard Chartered PLC STAN, +2.91% stock climbed 3% after posting a 16% rise in pretax profit as income rose faster than costs.", "description": "An otherwise quiet session for London stocks was peppered by gains for Standard Chartered and losses for retailer Next.", "authors": ["Barbara Kollmeyer", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HD689_london_ZG_20190211054225.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
