Their standing changed after the 1984 grand slam tour of Europe and after winning only four of their first 11 fixtures against Wales they have lost four of the past 31, the last of which was 10 months ago when the sides met in Cardiff.\n\nWales working hard to stay within laws at Rugby World Cup, says Justin Tipuric Read more\n\nWales were then in the middle of a run of 14 consecutive victories, which culminated in the Six Nations grand slam, and it is a sign of how the balance in this fixture has changed that three of the four changes Cheika has made to the side that defeated Fiji last Saturday are designed to counter two of Wales\u2019s threats: their kicking and their line speed in defence.\n\nDane Haylett-Petty replaces Kurtley Beale \u2013 who was exposed under the high ball by New Zealand last month \u2013 at full-back, while Will Genia and Bernard Foley, the half-backs when Australia beat Wales in the group decider at Twickenham four years ago, are restored to put the ball into space. The fourth change is enforced with Adam Ashley-Cooper taking over on the wing from Reece Hodge, whose three-match ban after being cited for a dangerous tackle against Fiji, together with the disciplinary panel\u2019s criticism that Australia\u2019s players seemed to be unaware of World Rugby\u2019s high-tackle framework, had sent Cheika into a fury.\n\nIf there is one bloke World Rugby are not listening to it is me, no matter what language I speak in\n\nBefore taking questions on his team selection, Cheika said he wanted to talk about Hodge\u2019s hearing and for nearly eight minutes fulminated against the system. \u201cThere is a part of it which is us versus everyone else,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that and we are not going to let it derail us. I do not care what World Rugby are doing. If there is one bloke they are not listening to it is me, no matter what language I speak in. We are not going to let them get to us.\u201d It sounded as if they already had.\n\nGatland, who announced an unchanged team from Monday\u2019s victory over Georgia when Wales, clinical and disciplined, led 29-0 at half-time, took Cheika\u2019s selection as a sign of respect. Australia have defeated Wales in each of the last three World Cups and have picked one of the most experienced squads in World Cup history with the 23 sharing 1,287 caps, an average of 56 each, but Wales total 935 with their captain, Alun Wyn Jones, setting a new national record of 130 on Sunday.\n\nPlay Video 1:01 Australia coach Michael Cheika defends Reece Hodge over high tackle rules \u2013 video\n\n\u201cI think it shows how far we have come as a team,\u201d said Gatland. \u201cIt has not always been the case with Wales: in the past teams probably thought we did not have an attacking threat. It shows how the modern game can change from one week to the next: you have to make sure your mental attitude is right and that you bring physicality to the game. We know we are going to have to match their intensity.\u201d\n\nCheika insisted Hodge should not have been cited for his challenge on Peceli Yato which left the Fiji flanker concussed, but the precedent was set last season when the Gloucester fly-half Danny Cipriani was sent off and banned for three weeks after failing to get out of the way in time as Munster\u2019s Rory Scannell charged at him and his shoulder made contact with the centre\u2019s head. Intent does not come into it.\n\nWhile the Hodge incident appears to have been distracting for Australia, and Cheika in particular, it may also prove galvanising. There was a period during the match against Fiji when they trailed 21-12 and, at least until Yato went off, when they were overrun but they dragged their way back through the European staples of set pieces and mauls to subdue their opponents.\n\nReece Hodge case provides unwanted World Cup distraction for Wallabies | Bret Harris Read more\n\nIt was a pragmatic response Wales will be wary of. Cheika has kept the same pack, and while David Pocock struggled to convince the referee of the legitimacy of some of his turnovers \u2013 ironic given that Ben O\u2019Keeffe comes from the land of Richie McCaw \u2013 Sunday\u2019s official, Romain Poite, will have a more laissez-faire attitude. However, having been persuaded by the television match official not to send off the Samoa centre Rey Lee-Lo for a dangerous tackle this week, he will not be sidetracked again.\n\n\u201cWe are very comfortable with him refereeing us,\u201d said Gatland, no doubt recalling a night in 2013 when the Frenchman took charge of the deciding test between Australia and the Lions in Sydney and quickly took exception to the way the home side scrummaged.\n\nWales, though, have to rely on themselves. This is probably their most significant match under Gatland, and not because victory provides a potentially clearer path to the final, but because it would be an achievement they have not managed in a World Cup: their only previous victory over a major southern hemisphere nation in the tournament was the 1987 play-off when the Wallabies were already on the beach.\n\n\u201cThe quality of Warren Gatland and his coaching team is second to none,\u201d said Cheika. And Wales have their captain, a veteran of the 2007 World Cup when he played in the 32-20 defeat to the Wallabies in Cardiff. \u201cThere has been a bit of the red stuff spilled in training this week,\u201d said Jones. \u201cIt shows the competitiveness in the squad and we will not shy away from the challenge that lies ahead.\u201d", "description": "Wales are content with favourites tag in Sunday\u2019s World Cup showdown while Australia hope to be galvanised by a sense of injustice", "authors": ["Paul Rees"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39ddb113ef90011a97ca6d4070728a5957ccb2ac/0_41_4400_2640/master/4400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7057b836cbf90396695289245399cfb1", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
