It would take 20 Republicans, along with everyone in the Democratic caucus, for the Senate to reach the two-thirds majority required to remove Trump. The winless New York Jets have a better shot at the Super Bowl.\n\nThe political calculation will guide some, but not all. There are already breaches in the Fox News firewall, and a stunning 28 percent of Republican voters in one recent poll favor the impeachment inquiry.\n\nPlaying to the larger moral issues is where the Mormon charge will be crucial. Another Mormon senator, Mike Crapo of Idaho, has kept an open mind thus far. An independent presidential candidate from 2016, Evan McMullin, has been a principled Mormon critic of Trump\u2019s lawlessness.\n\n\u201cRemember that Trump will tear down anyone who rightfully challenges him,\u201d McMullin said this week. \u201cUnable to lead with honor, all he has left is to make everyone seem as rotten as he is.\u201d\n\nThe rot among the collaterally rotten is already deep. White evangelicals \u2014 having looked the other way while the Stable Genius, showing his \u201cgreat and unmatched wisdom,\u201d put kids in cages, praised neo-Nazis, sucked up to murderous dictators and betrayed our beleaguered allies the Kurds \u2014 are gone, lost to the dark side.\n\nMost despicable of all, the Dallas pastor Robert Jeffress has suggested that impeaching Trump could cause a \u201cCivil War-like fracture\u201d in the country. Jeffress has also said terrible things about Jews, Mormons and Catholics \u2014 the kind of hate talk that has not kept him from being one of Trump\u2019s closest evangelical advisers.\n\nYou have to believe that most Republicans in Congress know Trump has violated his oath of office. But most of them are also cowards. That goes for some Mormon Republicans, such as Senator Mike Lee of Utah, a former Trump critic, now an enabler. For them, the old line from J.R. Ewing is apt: \u201cOnce you give up your integrity, the rest is a piece of cake.\u201d", "description": "The reddest faith in America is also the one most skeptical of Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Timothy Egan"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/11/opinion/11Egan/11Egan-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
