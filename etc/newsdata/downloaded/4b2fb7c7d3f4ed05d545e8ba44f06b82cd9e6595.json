But he\u2019s still raging against the music industry.", "language": "en", "text": "Why did it take so long to put out his box? That\u2019s when Miller brings up Gary Gersh, who ran Capitol Records back in the 1990s.\n\n\u201cJust a little gangster,\u201d Miller says, winding up. \u201cA complete, incompetent, lying piece of s---. And you know, that\u2019s candy-coating it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn this context \u2014 a quarter of a century after Gersh\u2019s reign, inside the rarefied walls of the Met \u2014 it\u2019s an unexpected, almost jarring digression. Except if you know anything about Steve Miller. Record business figures have always occupied a special space in his Rolodex of revenge. They lie, steal your money, and, worst of all, have no idea how to push your records.\n\nAD\n\nTo be specific, Miller blames Gersh for what happened the last time he put out a box, a career survey released in 1994. There were several problems, from the release date (too late that summer) to a production error on early pressings. Miller remembers Gersh ignoring his calls, and that got him daydreaming about what might happen if they bumped into each other in his then home of Idaho.\n\n\u201cGersh used to come and ski in Sun Valley and I was afraid I was going to see him and beat him to a pulp \u2014 because I would\u2019ve, if I had seen him,\u201d says Miller.\n\nAD\n\nTo a pulp? Is he serious? Miller has never shied away from conflict. In the \u201960s, when any kid with a guitar would have killed for a record deal, Miller studied the fine print and resisted until the terms changed. In the \u201970s, when he became an arena star, he virtually disappeared, refusing to put out music until he felt it was ready. Miller has not softened with age. Only three years ago, he turned his own Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction into a scathing and thoroughly entertaining takedown of the \u201cgangsters and crooks\u201d who are part of what he called a \u201cprivate boys\u2019 club.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s not pleasant to be at the other end of a Miller grenade. Black Keys singer Dan Auerbach, who helped induct him that night, said he had trouble sleeping for days after the event. Gersh, today an executive at concert presenter AEG Live, seemed stunned to hear of Miller\u2019s anger.\n\n\u201cTwenty-five years ago, I had one interaction with him and he\u2019s now saying he would beat me to a pulp because of a production error that I didn\u2019t cause,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you kidding me? That\u2019s insanity.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut speaking out has always been Miller\u2019s way and it hasn\u2019t stalled his career. At 75, he can play as many gigs as he likes, his catalogue remains a consistent seller and he\u2019s able to promote the music he loves through his relationships with the Met, where he serves on the visiting committee of the museum\u2019s Department of Musical Instruments, and Jazz at Lincoln Center, where he\u2019s on the board and programs a concert series that has included Marty Stuart and Jimmie Vaughan.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou know, I was raised with jazz musicians,\u201d says Wynton Marsalis, the trumpeter who serves as artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center. \u201cJazz wouldn\u2019t exist if people weren\u2019t like that. If you didn\u2019t have Charles Mingus, Max Roach, Miles Davis. They rubbed people the wrong way all the time.\u201d\n\nA star, not a celebrity\n\nStart with the hits. They occupy a special place in the classic rock canon, stretching from Miller\u2019s first No. 1, 1973\u2019s \u201cThe Joker,\u201d a swaggering, country-rocker, to his last, 1982\u2019s \u201cAbracadabra,\u201d a song inspired by a chance encounter with Diana Ross.\n\nAD\n\nThose FM-gumdrops have helped Miller sell more than 60 million albums over his career, including 14 million alone on the compilation \u201cGreatest Hits 1974-78\u201d album. That record is among the top 40 of all time, a few slots ahead of \u201cAbbey Road\u201d and \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe hits are an important part of understanding Miller\u2019s genius. His approach in the studio is humble and patient. Hooks are everywhere and not only in a song\u2019s chorus: The wolf-whistles in \u201cJungle Love,\u201d the echoing synthesizer in \u201cFly Like an Eagle,\u201d the \u201choo hoo\u201d in \u201cTake the Money and Run.\u201d Guitar heroism is to be avoided or, on the rare chance a solo is employed, it simply mirrors a song\u2019s melody. And then there\u2019s that voice, youthful, pure, with layers of perfect harmony. That voice hugs you, holds you and offers unconditional love.\n\nMiller was deliberate in how he cracked the code of pop music.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI had choices to make,\u201d says Miller. \u201cYou have to be really disciplined, but at the same time you want to get this great, spontaneous feeling on the record and you know you\u2019ve got three seconds to capture people\u2019s attention at the very entrance of a song.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWas it hard for him to hold back on guitar?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always considered myself a serious guitar player, but I haven\u2019t been really worried about whether the public thought I was,\u201d he says. \u201cThat never was part of my record sales strategy.\u201d\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the only thing that set Miller apart. In the 1970s, when Jimmy Page wore his dragon suit and Elton John performed while dressed as Minnie Mouse, Miller\u2019s greatest flourish would be turning up his shirt-collar. He rarely put his picture on album covers and when he did, as on \u201cThe Joker,\u201d he wore a mask.\n\nAD\n\nGreg Fischbach, an attorney who renegotiated Miller\u2019s contract in the 1970s, remembers walking outside the Los Angeles Forum after a concert with Miller at his peak.\n\n\u201cAnd Steve is dressed like I am,\u201d says Fischbach. \u201cKhakis and a blazer and a button-down shirt. The fans were saying, \u2018when\u2019s Steve going to be coming out.\u2019 And he gets in the car and we go. That\u2019s the kind of anonymity he loved.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMiller did not party at the Playboy Mansion or hang with Mick and Bianca at Studio 54. He tried cocaine once but reports that it \u201cfelt like I had rock salt in my sinuses.\u201d He stopped drinking in his 30s when it became a time-killing crutch during late nights on the road. In 1976, Miller even abandoned the hub of the record industry, moving from California to Oregon and setting up a farm.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe had paid for everything,\u201d says guitarist Les Dudek, who worked with Miller. \u201cHis cars, everything. He had all kinds of trusts set up. I asked him one day, \u2018Steve, why did you move from California?\u2019 He said, \u2018Les, in California, those people invent ways to steal my money.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just a line. Miller\u2019s most powerful weapon was always his willingness to walk away from any offer. If you ran a record company, you also couldn't win him over with flattery. One night, at a restaurant in Beverly Hills hotspot, Capitol saluted him by presenting a live horse.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI had just sold 13 million records or something,\u201d says Miller. \u201cIt was the first time they ever thought about doing anything nice for me. They gave me a horse and the horse was so stoned it could hardly stand up. And it was a pregnant horse. And I said, \u2018Did you give this horse anything?\u2019 And they said, \u2018Oh, absolutely not.\u2019 And about eight days later when the horse arrived at my ranch, it just looked at people and just totally freaked and bolted, and it took us two days to catch it and get it back in.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSteve\u2019s impression of people in the music business is right,\u201d says Fischbach, who would leave Miller in the early \u201980s to become president of Activision. \u201cThey basically took advantage of the artists. The question is how can you take advantage of the label? You can\u2019t do it by calling people dumb. You do it by working with people.\u201d\n\nGrowing up, Miller was surrounded by music. His father, George, a pathologist, loved jazz and blues and purchased one of the first reel-to-reel tape machines in the late 1940s. T-Bone Walker and Les Paul found themselves stopping by the Miller house to make recordings with his father\u2019s gear. Paul would become his godfather and lifelong friend.\n\nAD\n\nBy 12, Miller and a buddy had started the Marksmen, taking calls from frat houses, sororities, churches and synagogues.\n\n\u201cAnd they\u2019d say, \u2018Hey, this is Bobby Jones at SAE house and I understand you\u2019ve got this rock band. How much is it?\u2019 I\u2019d say, \u2018It\u2019s $125.\u2019 The guy would go, \u2018That\u2019s an awful lot of money.\u2019 I\u2019d say, \u2018Thanks for calling man. If you change your mind, let me know.\u2019 I\u2019d hang up the phone. The phone would ring and they\u2019d book us. I don\u2019t know why I was this way at the age of 12. But I didn\u2019t want to hear your sad story. My price was fair and it was good and I had the band booked in three weeks for the whole school year.\u201d\n\nMiller practiced endlessly and developed confidence. It could have been arrogance, except he was that good.\n\nKen Adamany, a keyboardist at the University of Wisconsin who would go on to manage Cheap Trick, remembers meeting Miller in 1961 after the guitarist arrived on campus to study comparative literature. Adamany\u2019s KnighTranes were playing a fraternity party. A kid with a crew cut stood in front of the stage the whole set.\n\n\u201cAnd he came up to me afterward and introduced himself,\u201d says Adamany. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m Steve Miller from Dallas. I\u2019m looking to get in a band.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe told Adamany he played guitar, bass, harmonica and sang. Then, he offered a blunt critique.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m better than everyone in your band, including you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s his actual quote,\u201d Adamany says. \u201cAnd he was right.\u201d\n\n'He didn't trust anybody'\n\nAt the Met, Miller walks through the museum\u2019s latest blockbuster, \u201cPlay It Loud: Instruments of Rock & Roll.\u201d He saw it on opening night in April, but the galleries were crowded as Miller posed with Jimmy Page and jammed with the Roots. The exhibition features several of Miller\u2019s instruments, including a painted Les Paul that\u2019s on the back cover of the catalogue.\n\nThe galleries are closed now and he stops at Muddy Waters\u2019s candy-apple-red Telecaster. He remembers, at 20, backing the blues icon in Chicago and being impressed with himself. \u201cWhen it was over, Muddy said, \u2018Hey, that great. Let\u2019s have a nice round of applause for \u2014 what\u2019s your name?\u2019 \u201d\n\nJimi Hendrix\u2019s Flying V also catches his eye. Miller played Monterey Pop and remembers Hendrix setting his Stratocaster on fire that Sunday in 1967. He found it annoying.\n\n\u201cI thought that was pathetic,\u201d says Miller. \u201cWhen I saw Jimi Hendrix stop playing the music he was playing and get down on his knees and pull out a can of lighter fluid and squirt it on the thing and light it, I went, \u2018Boy, this really f---ing sucks.\u2019\u201d\n\nA few minutes later, Miller walks into the \u201cExpanding the Band\u201d gallery and stops in front of a case in the center of the room and smiles.\n\n\u201cNow, here is the thing I\u2019m proudest of,\u201d he says.\n\nAcross the room, prog rock keyboardist Keith Emerson\u2019s rig towers over Miller. It\u2019s a ridiculous sea of cables and dials and switches and a board that looks capable of running a nuclear power plant.\n\n\u201cThat is what I was rebelling against,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the case is Miller\u2019s Roland synthesizer and an Echoplex tape delay machine slightly larger than a shoe box. Around 1975, Miller walked into a music store in San Rafael, Calif., looking for, as he puts it, \u201cthe dumbest synthesizer ever made. The one no keyboard player would use.\u201d The Roland was perfect. He took it home to work on the space intro to \u201cFly Like an Eagle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is how I did it,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt,\u201d as Miller states, has two meanings. There is the specific \u201cit,\u201d which is the recording of synth waves that float over \u201cFly Like An Eagle.\u201d \u201cIt\u201d also applies to how he carved out the space he needed to create the two albums that would change his life artistically and financially.\n\nBy 1972, Miller\u2019s once promising career \u2014 three of his first four albums landed in the top-25 \u2014 hit bottom. \u201cRecall the Beginning . . . A Journey From Eden\u201d stalled outside the Billboard Top 100 and left expectations low for his eighth record. \u201cThe Joker,\u201d released in October 1973, changed everything.\n\nWith that success, Miller again split from the script. A normal rock star would follow a massive hit with a huge tour, new record and another tour. Instead, Miller quickly laid down rhythm tracks for his next group of songs at a studio in San Francisco. Then he took the tapes home and spent two years experimenting with lyrics, guitar lines and laying down all of the vocals.\n\nMiller had already fought for control of his masters. Fischbach negotiated a new deal that gave him higher royalties.\n\nThe holdout ended with 1976\u2019s \u201cFly Like an Eagle\u201d and 1977\u2019s \u201cBook of Dreams.\u201d The songs on those albums were so popular that they make up 13 of the 14 tracks on \u201cGreatest Hits 1974-78\u201d and have dominated his concert sets for decades. The longer term implication is being felt now with \u201cWelcome to the Vault.\u201d\n\nIn the early \u201970s, when Miller was working at Capitol, he noticed Gene Vincent\u2019s master tapes shoved into cardboard boxes, basically forgotten. He decided only he could protect his music.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, can I have them?\u2019 I\u2019d just say, \u2018We\u2019re packing up. Put all these in boxes and put them in my truck. Let\u2019s go.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe tapes would eventually be stored in his warehouse. About 15 years ago, Miller hired a former band member, David Denny, to convert them and deliver reports.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019d listen and I\u2019d go . . . I\u2019m not going to release that.\u201d\n\nMiller realizes now that he\u2019s not the best person to scour his unreleased recordings. He has always been too hung up on making sure everything was perfect. So he\u2019s glad that his wife eventually got involved.\n\nJanice Ginsberg Miller, whom he married in 2014, suggested Miller release rarities while he could curate them. Ginsberg Miller listed close to 800 songs that Denny had organized. She also tracked down some stunning and previously unseen film clips, including one from Monterey. She then made her own presentation.\n\n\u201cI would play him \u2018Crossroads\u2019 from 1973 and he liked it,\u201d says Ginsberg Miller. \u201cThen I showed him \u2018Don Kirshner\u2019s Rock Concert\u2019 and that was one of his favorite performances. And that has the painted Les Paul all over it, and so all of a sudden you\u2019re curating the story with the artist, not of the artist after they\u2019re gone.\u201d\n\nThere was a catch. Miller had stopped recording new pop songs in the early \u201990s and no longer had a working relationship with Capitol, which is now owned by Universal Music Group. But Gersh was long gone, as was virtually anyone else he had tangled with.\n\nUniversal President Bruce Resnikoff had heard all the stories. He also knew that Miller is \u201cbrilliant\u201d and has \u201cone of the greatest archives an artist has ever kept.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what he told Miller when they started talking. He promised to assemble a new team to work with him. And when Miller shared the results of his latest audit \u2014 yes, he still conducts them \u2014 Resnikoff didn\u2019t argue. He had Universal write a check for the $600,000 Miller said he was owed in royalties.\n\n\u201cIs he difficult?\u201d says Resnikoff. \u201cI would say that he has a vision and he has talent and people with talent and vision are difficult if you don\u2019t pay attention.\u201d\n\nAnd how does Miller feel about his label? He doesn\u2019t hesitate.\n\n\u201cI love them,\u201d he says. \u201cFor the first time.\u201d\n\nPop genius Harry Nilsson left an unreleased record behind.
