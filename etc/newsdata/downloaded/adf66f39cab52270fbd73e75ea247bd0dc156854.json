BTC remains well supported above $9,000 and it could climb higher towards $10,000.\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis\n\nRecently, bitcoin price climbed towards the $10,000 resistance area against the US Dollar. However, BTC failed to continue higher and formed a high near the $9,935 level.\n\nLater, there was a fresh decline below the $9,600 and $9,500 support levels. The price traded close to the $9,100 support area and remained well bid above the 100 hourly simple moving average. The recent low was near $9,194 and the price is currently climbing steadily.\n\nThere was a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $9,935 high to $9,194 swing low. At the outset, bitcoin is testing the $9,500 and $9,550 resistance levels. Additionally, there is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $9,560 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.\n\nMore importantly, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $9,935 high to $9,194 swing low is acting as a hurdle for the bulls. Therefore, an upside break above the $9,550 and $9,600 levels is needed for a fresh increase.\n\nThe next major resistance is near the $9,720 level, above which the price could rise steadily towards the $10,000 resistance area. If the price accelerates above $10,000, it could revisit the $10,500 zone.\n\nConversely, if the price fails to break the $9,550 and $9,600 resistance levels, there could be another downward move. An immediate support is near the $9,200 area. Having said that, the main support is near the $9,000 level and the 100 hourly SMA.\n\nLooking at the chart, bitcoin seems to be consolidating nicely above the $9,000 and $9,200 levels. As long as there is no close below the 100 hourly SMA, there are chances of a fresh increase towards the $10,000 and $10,200 levels in the coming sessions.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD is showing positive signs in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for BTC/USD is moving higher and it is currently near the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $9,200 followed by $9,000.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $9,550, $9,600 and $9,720.", "description": "Bitcoin price is likely setting up for the next major break against the US Dollar.
