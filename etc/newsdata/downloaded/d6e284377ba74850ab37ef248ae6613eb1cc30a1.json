While these two offerings definitely added attractiveness to the sporty saloon, it continues to be virtually unchanged since its launch in late 2015. A new generation Giulia may not be coming in the next few years, but one designer decided to envision what a successor to today\u2019s model could look like.\n\nMeet the work of Kostur Alexandr, a Ukrainian designer, who believes the design of the current Giulia is too sporty to be able to attract customers in the mid-size premium segment in Europe, where the Audi A6, BMW 5 Series, and Mercedes-Benz E-Class still dominate the charts. Yes, the current Giulia competes with the smaller A4/3 Series/C-Class trio, but Alexandr proposes \u201ca more restrained but more solid style\u201d for a larger three-box vehicle with the same name, one that ditches the current round shapes for more edgy and sharper lines.\n\nWe can\u2019t help but notice the rendering sends some strong Alfa Romeo 166 vibes. The overall silhouette is similar and that\u2019s especially visible at the side profile and the rear fascia. The shape of the taillights might be different but it definitely makes a strong connection between the 166 and this new saloon. The headlights, on the other hand, are reminiscent of the units seen in the Giulia\u2019s predecessor, the 159 saloon.\n\nGiulia imagined as coupe:\n\nOne thing we miss with the Giulia is the lack of an estate variant. Alfa had some of the prettiest long-roof cars on the market in the recent past but that\u2019s long gone now. Our exclusive rendering from 2016 proposed a sporty Giulia Sportwagon but it remained just a beautiful imagination of our artists.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Fancy a more stylish and restrained Italian saloon?", "authors": ["Feedback", "Anthony Karr"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aj8ty1PVvdRXVWE8WrupNw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/motor1_uk_340/149ef37919c115d568727ad7da5f4fbb", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
