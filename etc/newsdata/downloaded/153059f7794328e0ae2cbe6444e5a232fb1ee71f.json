The associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Furman, were charged with funneling illegal contributions to a congressman whose help they had sought in removing Ms. Yovanovitch.\n\nHere\u2019s a guide to the Ukraine saga\u2019s growing cast of characters.\n\nA former ambassador to Ukraine speaks\n\nMs. Yovanovitch told impeachment investigators on Friday that a top State Department official had told her that Mr. Trump had pushed for her removal for months even though her employer, the State Department, believed she had \u201cdone nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nShe dismissed as \u201cfictitious\u201d accusations that she had been disloyal to Mr. Trump, which she said had been circulated by allies of Mr. Giuliani.\n\nMs. Yovanovitch, testifying in defiance of State Department orders and at risk of losing her job, delivered a scathing indictment of how the Trump administration conducts foreign policy, warning that private influence and personal gain have usurped diplomats\u2019 judgment and could undermine the nation\u2019s interests.\n\nMs. Yovanovitch said of her time in Ukraine: \u201cOur efforts were intended, and evidently succeeded, in thwarting corrupt interests in Ukraine, who fought back by selling baseless conspiracy theories to anyone who would listen. Sadly, someone was listening, and our nation is the worse off for that.\u201d", "description": "The White House says the impeachment inquiry is invalid. Joe Biden says impeach.
