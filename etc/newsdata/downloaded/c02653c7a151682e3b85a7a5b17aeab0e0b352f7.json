Donald Trump visits Lone Star State as Democrats seek inroads", "language": "en", "text": "DALLAS \u2013 In the political heart of Texas, a state Republicans have dominated for decades, Democrats say they are gaining ground \u2013 and one of the reasons rode into Dallas-Fort Worth on Thursday.\n\nHis name: Donald Trump.\n\nWhile Trump's policies on immigration, trade and the economy remain popular in Republican-leaning Texas, Democrats say the president's actions are helping them build a base of their own among Hispanics, city dwellers, and college-education professionals in the Lone Star State.\n\n\"Texas Democrats are rising,\" Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said as Trump supporters gathered for a rally at a sports arena in downtown Dallas. He added, \"once Texas turns blue, the White House will follow for a long time.\"\n\nAt the rally later in the evening, Trump scoffed at the notion that the Lone Star State is somehow in play, telling supporters: \"Donald Trump is not going to lose Texas, I can tell you that.\"\n\nIndeed, the president is still favored to carry Texas in the 2020 election \u2013 he won it by nine percentage points in 2016. But members of both parties said Democrats are in a position to make it more of a challenge.\n\nAnd while Texas Democrats haven't won a statewide race since 1994, they nearly captured a Senate seat last year and are closing the gap in legislative and congressional elections.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally at American Airlines Arena in Dallas, Texas, on Oct. 17, 2019. More\n\n\"It's fair to say the state is more competitive than it has been, and the threat is real,\" said Texas-based Republican political consultant Matt Mackowiak, though he added: \"I do not think it will be in play in the presidential race.\"\n\nTrump supporters could not be more confident about Texas, noting that the state has seen increases in job creation and energy production since Trump took office, while Democrats are promoting \"socialist\" ideas on health care and gun control.\n\n\"There are too many people who feel the way I do\" in Texas, said Brenda Lewis, 72, a Fort Worth retiree who grabbed a front-row seat at the rally. \"They don't want to change it to Cuba.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally at American Airlines Arena in Dallas, Texas, Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019. More\n\nTrump didn't visit Texas on Thursday because he's worried about losing the state, aides said. From Texarkana to El Paso, the state is a giant ATM for presidential candidates in both parties, and Trump began his day by raising an estimated $5.5 million at fundraisers in Fort Worth.\n\nTrump then headed to nearby Johnson County to help cut the ribbon at a new Louis Vuitton leather manufacturing workshop, an appearance in which he highlighted plans to make jobs a major campaign issue.\n\nAs he did at rallies last week in Minnesota and Louisiana, Trump used his Texas gig to buck buck up his base as he faces numerous challenges back in Washington, D.C. \u2013 most notably an impeachment inquiry led by House Democrats.\n\nTrump and his Texas supporters predicted that a backlash against impeachment will help Trump.\n\n\"People like us will come out in force,\" said Sandra Brewer, 52, a flight attendant from Granbury, Tex.\n\nStanding outside American Airlines Center hours before the rally, Brewer added that \"President Trump goes through so much day after day. Most people would have been crushed by now. But he keeps going and going.\"\n\nDemocrats dream of a Blue Texas", "description": "While Trump's policies remain popular in Republican-leaning Texas, Democrats say the president's actions are helping them build a base of their own.", "authors": ["David Jackson", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/b_.TQM8miZTqOKBWIeujMA--~B/aD0zMjczO3c9NDkwOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/dd63ea2b1f55fb9fd6a53d82bdb236d2", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
