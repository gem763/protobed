Delta Flight 337 returned to Atlanta.\n\nMore than 1,300 flights within, to and from the US had been canceled by Monday evening, with Fort Lauderdale in Florida the most impacted airport, according to the aviation tracking website FlightAware.com.\n\nWhile it's worth bearing in mind these flights could be canceled for any reason, most are likely due to the disruption caused by the storm.\n\nRelated content Hurricane Dorian obliterates houses in the Bahamas, killing a boy as it heads toward the US\n\nFlightAware also showed more than 1,100 flight cancellations for Tuesday within, to and from the US.\n\nAmerican Airlines, Southwest, JetBlue, Spirit, Carriers including Delta United and Frontier are offering travelers the option to change or delay flight bookings within affected areas, with certain terms and conditions applying.\n\nPassengers are not automatically entitled to assistance, however.\n\n\"As the flight disruption is caused by bad weather, this is considered to be 'force majeure' or an 'extraordinary circumstance' and airlines are therefore not liable to compensate passengers who experience a delay or cancellation,\" said Paloma Salmeron, a spokeswoman at air passenger rights organization AirHelp.com.\n\n\"However, if the delay exceeds five hours or if the flight is canceled, the air passenger is entitled to either a full or partial refund of their original ticket or a return flight to their point of departure if necessary.\"\n\n\"We advise passengers to keep hold of all travel documents and speak to their airline representative to see what they can offer.\"\n\nFort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport suspended service on Monday. Michele Eve Sandberg/AFP/Getty Images\n\nNassau Airport in Bahamas confirmed it's open Monday, clarifying that schedules may vary due to the storm. Bahamas International Airport in Newport currently has no updates, likely because of communication issues.\n\nMiami International remained open as of late Monday afternoon.\n\nCruise ships changing schedules\n\nCruise ship itineraries are also impacted.\n\nCarnival Cruise Line has adjusted itineraries for numerous ships leaving out of Jacksonville, Port Canaveral and Charleston in preparation for Hurricane Dorian.\n\nRoyal Caribbean says it is \" closely monitoring \" Dorian, shortening and extending some ship itineraries where necessary, although the company said that \"being onboard a ship is one of safest places to be during a storm.\"\n\nFor non-cruise aficionados, that might seem hard to believe, but Brian Major, executive editor for Caribbean and Latin America at US content company travAlliancemedia, tells CNN Travel that's because cruise ships will always amend their itineraries to avoid sailing into a storm and ensuring the safety of passengers.\n\n\"The ships are very astute in making sure they avoid those storms,\" says Major. \"It will impact some folks' vacations, which is the unfortunate part of it. But it's better than sailing towards a hurricane.\"\n\nMajor says cruisers should stay in contact with their cruise line and contact their travel agent if they think they won't be able to get to the port or if they're worried about port closures.\n\n\"These situations always bring to light the importance of travel insurance,\" he adds.\n\nMajor also notes that the Bahamas is the number one cruise destination in the world in terms of number of ships, and the potential impact is concerning.\n\n\"To see the number one cruise port threatened in this way is something to be concerned about and to keep an eye on.\"\n\nRelated content Hurricane Dorian wipes out houses in the Bahamas, killing a boy as it heads toward the US\n\nAccommodation\n\nMany hotels in the hurricane's path have been boarded up and travelers have been evacuated to temporary shelters.\n\nMarriott International will \"continue to monitor the path of Hurricane Dorian, and our hotels in the predicted path have implemented storm preparation protocols,\" the hotel announced in a statement\n\nHilton issued a similarly worded statement , encouraging guests to call 1-800-HILTONS (800-774-1500) for up-to-date information on individual hotels.\n\nSome hotels have posted their plans on websites or pinned to their social media pages detailing when and if they're closing -- including the swanky The Sanctuary Hotel at Kiawah Island Golf Resort south of Charleston, South Carolina, which details plans to close Monday and reassess its status on Thursday.\n\nThe Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association, comprised of 10,000 restaurants and hotels across the Sunshine State, issued a statement urging members to waive cancellation fees, as well as \"extending hospitality to pets by relaxing any pet restrictions they may have.\"\n\nOther hotels outside the hurricane's path are operating as emergency shelters. Evacuees who can get to Statesboro, Georgia can check out VisitStatesboro.org for information on hotel spaces currently available there.\n\nHotel relief effort\n\nChef Jose Andres told CNN that -- before the hurricane hit -- hotel owners in the Bahamas pledged to be part of the hotel relief effort, offering Andres' nonprofit World Central Kitchen the opportunity to use hotel kitchens to serve food to those in need.\n\nAndres said on September 1 that the nonprofit has not yet been able to confirm whether or not this offer still stands, due to communication issues.\n\nThere will likely be further relief needed over the coming week: the American Red Cross says 19 million people live in areas across Florida, Georgia and South Carolina that could be impacted by the storm in the coming days.\n\nThose communities include Georgia's Golden Isles, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, and other popular beach resorts that were hosting travelers over the Labor Day holiday weekend.\n\nRelated content Hurricane Dorian slams into the Bahamas\n\nDisney storm preps, other parks\n\nIn Orlando, Walt Disney World Resort has adjusted its Tuesday hours due to the advancing storm.
