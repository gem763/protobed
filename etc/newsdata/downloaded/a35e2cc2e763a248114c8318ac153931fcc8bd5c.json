REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo\n\nHARARE (Reuters) - Striking doctors in Zimbabwe marched to parliament on Thursday to protest the disappearance of their union leader and press the government to increase their pay after a court ruled that police should not interfere with the march.\n\nPolice had blocked previous attempts by the doctors to march to President Emmerson Mnangagwa\u2019s offices and to parliament to present petitions after Peter Magombeyi, the leader of the Zimbabwe Hospitals Doctors Association (ZDHA), went missing.\n\nThe group challenged the police actions and High Court Judge Clement Phiri ruled that the doctors could go ahead with Thursday\u2019s march after lawyers for the police conceded that the actions by law enforcement agents were unlawful.\n\nZDHA represents junior and middle level doctors at public hospitals. The doctors have been on strike since Sept. 3, demanding a further pay increase as living costs soar.\n\nAs in the past, the government has called in army medics to help in the hospitals, which are already struggling with shortages of medicines.\n\n\u201cThe situation in our hospitals is so saddening and we don\u2019t draw any pleasure from it. The sooner it ends the better for us,\u201d Tawanda Zvakada, ZHDA acting secretary general told said after handing in a petition to parliament.\n\nRiot police were out in full force and cordoned off a park near parliament where the doctors gathered, to stop ordinary citizens from joining the demonstration.\n\nLast month, police banned protests planned by the opposition over Mnangagwa\u2019s handling of the economy.\n\nThe demonstrations were viewed as a test of Mnangagwa\u2019s willingness to tolerate dissent in a country tainted by a long history of repression under his predecessor Robert Mugabe, who died on Sept. 6 in Singapore.", "description": "Striking doctors in Zimbabwe marched to parliament on Thursday to protest the disappearance of their union leader and press the government to increase their pay after a court ruled that police should not interfere with the march.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431573324&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I0SI-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
