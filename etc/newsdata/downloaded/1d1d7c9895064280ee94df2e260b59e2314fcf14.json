I looked at my husband and just started sobbing.\n\n\u2018I guess I was in shock and my first thought was that I was going to die.\u2019\n\nLouise was rushed to the Freeman Hospital, in Newcastle, and had a stent fitted into her left coronary artery.\n\nAs soon as she had the surgery, Louise said she \u2018immediately\u2019 began to feel better, adding: \u2018I couldn\u2019t believe it was that quick. The surgeon said there is a second blockage in my other artery, but it\u2019s not big enough to need a stent\u2019.\n\nLouise is urging other women to prioritise their heart health from a young age, as she feels many women think a heart attack won\u2019t happen to them.\n\nNow she has had time to reflect, Louise said in the week leading up to the heart attack she was falling asleep on the sofa as soon as she got home from work, which was unusual for her.\n\nLouise is urging women to look out for the early signs (Picture: ncjMedia Ltd)\n\nBut the busy working mum thought she\u2019d just \u2018hit a wall\u2019 juggling the pressures of life and staying late at work, adding: \u2018Which I realise now is a typical female response.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said: \u2018Women I meet at work and socialising don\u2019t always know the warning signs of a heart attack.\n\n\u2018I had extreme tiredness before mine, but thought it was just because I was busy. I am more conscious of how I eat and what I eat now.\n\n\u2018I try not to take on too much anymore and don\u2019t work as long hours.\u2019\n\nLouise is raising awareness of the symptoms she suffered as the British Heart Foundation (BHF) launches a new briefing, which reveals stark inequalities in awareness, diagnosis and treatment of heart attacks that are killing women in the UK.\n\nIts new research shows women often delay seeking medical help by more than two hours, reducing their chance of survival, as many see heart attacks as a \u2018man\u2019s disease\u2019.\n\nMore than 8,200 women in England and Wales alone died over a 10-year period because they did not receive equal treatment to men.\n\nDr Sonya Babu-Narayan, Associate Medical Director of the British Heart Foundation, said heart attacks have never been so treatable.\n\nShe added: \u2018Yet women are dying needlessly because heart attacks are often seen as a man\u2019s disease, and women simply don\u2019t receive the same standard of treatment as men.\n\n\u2018The studies detailed in this briefing have revealed inequalities at every stage of a woman\u2019s medical journey, and though complex to dissect, they add up to a societal failure to provide fair care for women. Together, we must change this.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr Babu-Narayan added that the assumption women are not at risk of a heart attack is \u2018false and has proven to be deadly\u2019.\n\nShe added: \u2018The BHF wants to empower women to better understand their risk and to know the many symptoms of a heart attack.\n\n\u2018When someone has a heart attack \u2013 every second counts. The sooner people recognise their symptoms and call 999, the better their chance of recovery\u2019.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
