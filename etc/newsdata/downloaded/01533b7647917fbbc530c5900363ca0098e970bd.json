That's an eight-second gain by a male against a female in a 50-second race. https://t.co/6Y0OEdhsz1 \u2014 Wings Over Scotland (@WingsScotland) September 29, 2019\n\n\u201cHow big a difference is eight seconds? Well, a gap of just *0.8* seconds, over 1600m, was the difference between 2nd and 5th in that race,\u201d the Twitter user added.\n\nGranted, the video did not concern men claiming to be transgender women competing against natural-born women, but the video clearly shows just how much faster and stronger male athletes are compared to women. The implication for transgender athletes and their natural-born female opponents is clear.\n\nIndeed, the women\u2019s rights group, Fair Play for Women, amplified the Scottish Twitter user\u2019s posts and noted that the video is a perfect example of how unfair it is for men claiming to be women to compete as a natural-born woman.\n\nThis is male performance advantage in action. This is why female sport is a protected category and why all males have to be excluded, even ones who identity as trans. Sex matters. https://t.co/iIQUHbZwNG \u2014 FairPlayForWomen (@fairplaywomen) September 29, 2019\n\nAccording to its website, Fair Play for Women \u201cis a campaigning and consultancy group which raises awareness, provides evidence and analysis, and works to protect the rights of women and girls in the UK.\u201d\n\nThe group also provides legal and scientific evidence to help craft sports policies that \u201cmaintain fairness and safety for women and girls.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the group is not alone. A new study finds that hormone therapy, testosterone treatments, and surgery really do little to dampen the strength and power of the male physique for men who want to compete as transgender women.\n\nThe new study conducted by the Swedish Karolinska Institute and Linkoping University found that even after a full year of hormone therapy, transgender women still retain their male strength and muscle mass.\n\n\u201cDespite the robust increases in muscle mass and strength in TM, the TW were still stronger and had more muscle mass following 12months of treatment,\u201d the researchers found. \u201cThese findings add new knowledge that could be relevant when evaluating transwomen\u2019s eligibility to compete in the women\u2019s category of athletic competitions.\u201d\n\nA similar study from three professors at New Zealand\u2019s University of Otago, similarly concluded that men claiming to be transgender women do not lose much of their male strengths in sports despite testosterone loss, hormone therapy, and transgender surgeries.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "A video showing a make track athlete easily racing past a female runner highlights the unfairness of transgender athletes.", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Screenshot-10-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
