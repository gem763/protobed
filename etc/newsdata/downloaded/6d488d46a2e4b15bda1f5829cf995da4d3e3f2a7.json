As Lorenzo Reyes details, the league's elite class is starting to crystalize. USA TODAY\n\nThese players saw their fantasy values increase or decrease most based on their performances in Week 8:\n\nSizzlers\n\nRB Aaron Jones, Green Bay Packers: Green Bay has found a running game by effectively utilizing both Jones and Jamaal Williams. Jones had 226 yards combined and two touchdowns and had another long score called back due to a penalty.\n\nRB Tevin Coleman, San Francisco 49ers: Coleman had four total touchdowns in a rout of Carolina. With Arizona up next on Thursday, Coleman should be glued into lineups everywhere.\n\nWR Mike Evans, Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Evans can catch anything thrown in his vicinity, as evidenced by him hauling in 11 of 12 targets for 198 yards and a pair of touchdowns.\n\nWR Cooper Kupp, Los Angeles Rams: Kupp has been a master at finding seams in the defense, torching the Bengals for 220 yards and a touchdown. His success is overshadowed the other Rams receivers.\n\nQB Daniel Jones, New York Giants: With critics wondering if he should remain the starter, Jones provided a clear answer with a 322-yard passing performance with four touchdowns and no interceptions.\n\nGiants quarterback Daniel Jones had the best passing day of his young career on Sunday in Detroit, completing 28-of-41 for 322 yards and four touchdowns.

With the Miami Dolphins up next, a lot is riding on coach Adam Gase. If Bell doesn't produce again, that's on the coaching staff.\n\nWR Larry Fitzgerald, Arizona Cardinals: Even in a blowout loss, Fitzgerald was once again an afterthought with two receptions on four targets for 8 yards. With San Francisco up next, things don't get any easier.\n\nWR Corey Davis, Tennesee Titans: The switch at quarterback to Ryan Tannehill and the apparent chemistry he had with Davis in Week 7 was apparently a mirage. Davis secured just two receptions for 9 yards against the 31st-ranked Tampa Bay pass defense.\n\nTE Zach Ertz, Philadelphia Eagles: Catching just two passes for 20 yards, Ertz once again took a back seat in the offense. It's mind-boggling to see Dallas Goedert more involved in the game plan.\n\nRB Ty Johnson, Detroit Lions: Last week's waiver wire darling turned into a pumpkin. Even though Detroit rotated four running backs, Johnson led the group with 3.6 yards per carry. Kerryon Johnson's touches seem to have been replaced by a fantasy-unfriendly committee.", "description": "New York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones throws for a career-high four touchdowns, while Philadelphia Eagles tight end Zach Ertz continues to struggle.", "authors": ["Tony Holm", "Published P.M.
