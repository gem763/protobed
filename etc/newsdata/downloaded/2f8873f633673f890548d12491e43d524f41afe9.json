Officials and prominent figures close to the government are promising political, social and media reform; an unprecedented gesture since Sisi took office in 2014.\n\nFirst came the arrests, one of the largest waves of detentions in the country in recent years, with thousands taken in. Then Ali Abdel Aal, the speaker in parliament, offered a U-turn this week, suggesting more freedoms for dissidents and critics. Meanwhile Sisi promised to restore food subsidies for nearly 2 million Egyptians who have been weeded out of the staples, including rice, pasta, cooking oil and other essentials.\n\nThe protesters, who took to the streets by the hundreds in a number of Egypt\u2019s main cities, chanted \u201cSisi, leave!\u201d for the first time since he toppled the former president Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nMany analysts doubt the credibility of reform promises, sighting the spur-of-the-moment attempt by the government to cool down tension. The protests showed to the world that stability under Sisi can be questionable and should not be taken for granted, they added.\n\nWhat does the government really fear?\n\nIt fears instability. Throughout the past five years, Sisi has repeatedly expressed his anxiety towards any potential reiteration of the 2011 uprising that ended Hosni Mubarak\u2019s 30-year rule. Another mass uprising would weaken his grip on power, and slash economic gains. It could also set the scene for a comeback by the Muslim Brotherhood, according to his supporters.\n\nSisi has overseen a crackdown on dissent that has extended to liberal as well as Islamist groups, which rights groups say is the most severe in recent memory. Muslim Brotherhood leaders have been imprisoned or have fled abroad.\n\nThe latest protests have left Egypt\u2019s dollar bonds falling, with the main stock index wiping out its 2019 gains in just three days.\n\nSeveral hundred of those detained in the past two weeks \u2013 who include prominent writers, activists and opposition figures who had no direct link to the current protests \u2013 have been placed under investigation for charges including using social media to spread false news, joining a banned terrorist group and protesting without a permit, defence lawyers say.\n\nIs this only about stability?\n\nNo, it\u2019s not. The protests were prompted by calls from an Egyptian businessman living in exile who has accused Sisi and the military of corruption in videos posted on social media. Sisi has called the allegations \u201clies and slander\u201d but analysts have said that his army commanders seem extremely concerned because the corruption allegations, for the first time, throw cold water on the military\u2019s historically heroic image in the consciousness of ordinary Egyptians.\n\nA prominent lawyer and activist in Cairo, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The Independent: \u201cGenerals don\u2019t want to be pushed to the frontline in any confrontation with the people. This is a red line for them.\u201d\n\nUntil now, it is not clear why security forces seemed ready to tolerate the protests when they first erupted. Politicians close to the government say security forces have been taken by surprise but have rebuffed any claims of internal disagreement between factions in the government that may have slowed a response.\n\nDuring a summit with President Donald Trump at the UN General Assembly, Sisi blamed \u201cpolitical Islam\u201d for the protests.\n\nWhy the U-turn now?\n\nThe government has seemingly begun to grasp how deeply affected the working and middle classes are by the severe austerity measures the country has adopted over the past three years in exchange for a $12bn loan from the International Monetary Fund.\n\nOfficials at the highest level began to realise that keeping strict control over the media left authorities unsure how to face the series of videos on social media by Mohammed Ali, a former contractor and actor.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the government is compelled to try to appease public opinion means that it\u2019s traditional, obstinate, arrogant, no response towards public criticism began to crack,\u201d says Said Sadek, professor of political sociology, who is based in Cairo.\n\nAre the government promises enough?\n\nIt is too early to tell, and it all depends on how the public takes the news. But early signs suggest that what has been announced so far is far too little and doesn\u2019t come near the people\u2019s real expectations.\n\n\u201cThough this looks like a positive gesture, it is not sufficient, because what\u2019s being offered does not meet the minimum of all the economic and political grievances,\u201d Sadek says. He added that \u201ccriticism of government corruption, inefficiency and lack of accountability on various policies remain outside the package of these tiny donations the government is offering.\u201d\n\nWhat should we expect now?\n\nThe calls for further protests seem to be fading, but the government is on high alert, and Sisi\u2019s cabinet may pay the price.\n\nLocal newspapers expect a sweeping cabinet reshuffle in the coming days.\n\nIn a period where Arab youth appear ready more than ever to try and topple the stagnant political elite, they will expect real change.\n\n\u201cWhat is really needed is more transparency in making government budget spending; a clear, effective, accountable counterterrorism strategy in North Sinai and more political tolerance of civilian political opposition,\u201d Sadek says.", "description": "Egypt\u2019s government and its president,\u00a0Abdel Fattah\u00a0el-Sisi, seem\u00a0to have been rattled by the\u00a0protests that began a couple of weeks ago, a rare event in the country given Sisi\u2019s crackdown on dissent.
