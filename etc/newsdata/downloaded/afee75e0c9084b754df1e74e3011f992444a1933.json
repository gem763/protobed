No staff or patients have become sick, and the hospital continues to admit patients.\n\nAD\n\nWayne Turnage, the District\u2019s deputy mayor for health and human services, said contractors are working up to 14-hour shifts while flushing the water system with chlorine. He said their work was expected to be completed Friday, followed by testing for residual bacteria that will take at least 48 hours.\n\nAD\n\nThe water system should be back online sometime next week, possibly as late as Thursday or Friday, Turnage said. He said officials were continuing to investigate how the bacteria entered the water system.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re without water, which is a necessary staple . . . it\u2019s a severe challenge,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cstaff and inpatients are holding up pretty well.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTurnage said water problems are threatening patients\u2019 access to hot meals, which typically are prepared on site. Dishwashers can\u2019t be used and water can\u2019t be boiled for cooking while the system is flushed, so the facility is bringing in meals from an outside contractor served on paper plates.\n\nD.C. Council member Vincent C. Gray (D-Ward 7), who leads the council\u2019s health committee, said D.C. Water determined the contamination \u201cis confined to the specific parcel where the hospital is located, rather than the entire St. Elizabeths campus.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe said in a statement he expects to receive a report detailing how the bacteria entered the water system and how similar issues can be prevented in the future. The water problems were first reported by Washington City Paper.\n\nAD\n\nD.C. Water spokeswoman Pamela Mooring said the bacteria were related to \u201can issue with internal plumbing at St Elizabeths and not from our water distribution system.\u201d She said D.C. Water consulted with St. Elizabeths staff last week to address the water problems and give advice on sampling.\n\nSt. Elizabeths nurse Tinuolu Shokunbi said nurses are working to maintain hygiene, even though persuading patients to walk outside the building to a trailer containing portable showers isn\u2019t always easy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to work without water,\u201d she said. \u201cThe job entails washing our hands all the time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAndrea Procaccino, an attorney at Disability Rights DC, which advocates for patients at St. Elizabeths, said she checked on patients Monday at the facility and saw 10 portable showers available to patients. She said \u201cpatients don\u2019t seem upset\u201d and no one has gotten sick.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing the best they can with wipes,\u201d she said.\n\nProcaccino said patients and staff haven\u2019t been given details on the cleanup process or the timeline for making the water system usable again.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re being told it\u2019s going to be soon, so they\u2019re trying to hang in there,\u201d she said.\n\nProcaccino said some faucets had been removed from sinks because patients were using the water to wash their hands. She said she doesn\u2019t understand why the problem hasn\u2019t been fixed after two weeks.\n\n\u201cIf this was at Johns Hopkins, they would have had it remediated. . . . That\u2019s what really frustrates me,\u201d she said. \u201cYou start to get into the issue of \u2018Who cares about these people?\u2019 They\u2019re D.C.\u2019s most vulnerable people and they don\u2019t have a voice.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 6,000 cases of the pneumonia-like Legionnaires\u2019 disease were reported in the United States in 2016. The illness is fatal in about 10 percent of cases when people become sick, the CDC said.\n\n\u201cLegionella occurs naturally in freshwater environments, like lakes and streams,\u201d according to the CDC. \u201cIt can become a health concern when it grows and spreads in human-made building water systems.\u201d\n\nFounded in 1855, St. Elizabeths was the nation\u2019s first federally funded mental hospital. Many patients are criminal defendants, including those awaiting competence hearings and others found not guilty by reason of insanity.\n\nAD\n\nThe hospital has a history of difficulties. Patients sued over poor conditions in 1974, when the hospital housed more than 3,600 people, sparking litigation that didn\u2019t end until 2012. In 2006, the U.S. Justice Department found that conditions at the hospital violated patients\u2019 constitutional rights, and the District entered into a consent decree from 2007 until 2014.\n\nAD\n\nAn outbreak of Legionnaires\u2019 disease struck the hospital decades ago. In 1965, when St. Elizabeths was operated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, several patients died after an outbreak of what was referred to at the time as \u201cSt. Elizabeths fever.\u201d CDC scientists discovered about 12 years later that the illness was Legionnaires\u2019 disease.\n\nFenit Nirappil contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "The D.C. psychiatric hospital is using bottled water, portable showers and hand sanitizer.", "authors": ["Justin Wm.
