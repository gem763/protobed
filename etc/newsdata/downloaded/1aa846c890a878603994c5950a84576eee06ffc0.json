However, Australia is one of the most aggressive polluters on a per-capita basis; University of Melbourne research shows Australia ranks well above China, India, and the United States in carbon emissions for each resident.\n\nThe Prime Minister, whose government has backed the creation of the controversial and enormous Adani Carmichael coal mine project, said Australia only accounts for 5.5% of the planet\u2019s coal extraction.\n\nNotably, Australia remains the world\u2019s second-largest exporter of power plant-fuelling coal in the world.\n\nEchoing sentiments he expressed to reporters earlier in the week, Morrison urged commentators to express positivity about the climate and Australia\u2019s emission reduction policies, lest too many young people start spinning out.\n\nREAD MORE Scott Morrison Really Wants The Kids To Pipe Down About The Fact The Planet's Dying\n\n\u201cWe must respect and harness the passion and aspiration of our younger generations, rather than allow others to compound or, worse, facelessly exploit their anxiety for their own agendas,\u201d Morrison said, without providing evidence, echoing the sentiments of some particularly suspicious Australian columnists.\n\nWhile world leaders should \u201cnot allow their concerns to be dismissed or diminished as this can also increase their anxiety,\u201d Morrison urged folks to just let kids enjoy their childhoods \u2013 another apparent reference to Thunberg, who said her childhood had been \u201cstolen\u201d by current climate policies.\n\n\u201cAbove all, we should let our kids be kids \u2013 teenagers be teenagers \u2013 while we work positively together to deliver practical solutions for them and their future,\u201d Morrison said.\n\nIf you want, you can cop his full speech below. Fair warning: it\u2019s not too much we haven\u2019t heard before from a man who once brought a lump of coal into the House of Representatives.", "description": "The PM told the UN kids are being exploited and disputed media reports on Aussie policies.", "authors": ["David Adams"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/morrison-un.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
