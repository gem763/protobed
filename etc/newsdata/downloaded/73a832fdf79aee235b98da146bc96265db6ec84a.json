In her typical subversive fashion, the Oscar winner begins the clip by snarling, \u201cThe last thing the world needs is another beauty brand. But that\u2019s too bad.\u201d\n\nThe first sentence in Gaga\u2019s cheeky voiceover has a point. In the last few years, Rihanna, Madonna, Victoria Beckham, Drew Barrymore, Kim Kardashian, and Miranda Kerr have all launched makeup lines of their own.\n\nJust last month, the model Hailey Bieber (n\u00e9e Baldwin) filed a trademark for Bieber Beauty. The US Patent & Trademark Office ultimately denied her request when it was discovered that her now-husband Justin beat her to the punch, putting in for one as a 9-year-old back in 2003. (Don\u2019t you just hate it when that happens?)\n\nCelebrities and makeup have gone together since at least the 16th century, when Elizabeth I\u2019s feverishly white complexion, receding hairline, and blood red lips became popular simply because she was. The hygiene line Lux Soaps truly got the endorsement party started in 1929 when it was one of the first beauty brands to enlist stars to hawk its goods; Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn, and Natalie Wood all graced its advertisements over the years.\n\nElizabeth Taylor\u2019s name became synonymous with perfume when she launched her White Diamonds scent in 1991. While Cher and Sophia Lauren had dabbled in the fragrance world during the \u201880s, Taylor\u2019s floral iteration crushed expectations. With its $20 million marketing campaign and truly fabulous film noir-themed commercials, White Diamonds became a smash hit.\n\n\u201cPeople started to feel like they could buy White Diamonds and add some celebrity glamour to their day,\u201d Rachel Weingarten, a beauty writer and marketing strategy consultant, told The Daily Beast. \u201cYou had those commercials where she looked into the camera, smoldering with those violet eyes. Maybe it wasn\u2019t Butterfield 8, the height of her glamour, but people still felt that certain cachet associated with the celebrity.\u201d\n\nSo they bought the perfume\u2014a lot. According to the brand, to this day four bottles are sold every minute.\n\nIn 1994, the Somali fashion model Iman launched her eponymous makeup line after spending years backstage at runway shows mixing foundations to match her dark skin tone.\n\nDecades before the internet collectively lauded Rihanna for her inclusive 40 shades of cover-up, (white, male) execs reportedly told Iman that the line would fail because they assumed black women did not buy foundation. Today, her makeup line is still sold at drugstores; it\u2019s worth more than $25 million.\n\nEven with Iman\u2019s success, celebrities were slow to embrace the beauty boom. In the early 2000s, Weingarten attempted to develop a line of lip glosses with Christina Aguilera. She pitched the collection under the title \u201cWhat a Girl Wants,\u201d after the pop star\u2019s early hit single.\n\nXtina, deep in her midriff-bearing, chaps-wearing \u201cDirrty\u201d phase, did not think the line was \u201cdaring\u201d enough for her brand. The project never came to fruition, and Aguilera went on to partner with Sears as a spokesperson for \u201cFetish Cosmetics.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of these celebrities don\u2019t realize that their audience isn\u2019t who they\u2019re trying to project to,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cAguilera\u2019s audience back then was more young girls\u2014not after the edgy, dirty look. I stand by my reasoning that \u2018What a Girl Wants\u2019 lip gloss would have sold like crazy.\u201d\n\nIn 2002, Jennifer Lopez released \u201cGlow,\u201d a soapy smell housed inside an hourglass-shape bottle. According to Paper, the fragrance\u2019s launch party was held at Trump Tower \u201cwith the building\u2019s owner in attendance.\u201d Despite the seal of approval from Trump\u2014a licensing fiend himself\u2014beauty bigwigs predicted a dud.\n\nNot so: \u201cGlow\u201d went on to earn $100 million in a year and spawn countless spinoff scents. J.Lo still makes money from the venture, and last year she released a 70-piece makeup collaboration with the Polish beauty brand Inglot.\n\n\u201cJ. Lo does it perfectly,\u201d Weingarten said of Lopez\u2019s business savvy. \u201cShe comes out with ten million products. There is so much to choose from, and she understands that 60-year-old housewives love her, and 16-year-old boys love her. She appeals to everyone.\u201d\n\nA laundry list of pop singers and starlets have followed in J.Lo\u2019s stiletto-paved footsteps. Britney Spears, Ariana Grande, Paris Hilton, and Taylor Swift have all slapped their names on various bottle molds. Even Paul Stanley launched a couples\u2019 fragrance called \u201cKISS Her\u201d and \u201cKISS Him.\u201d\n\n\u201cMass market perfume has always been an accessible product,\u201d Charcy Evers, a retail trend analyst, said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t afford a Gucci bag, you get Gucci perfume.\u201d And if you can\u2019t be Ariana Grande, you can always smell like her.\n\n\u201cIf you have a younger fanbase, like Britney Spears, you can provide them with something they can grow with,\u201d Kirbie Johnson, a beauty reporter and co-host of the podcast \u201cGloss Angeles\u201d added. \u201cBritney fans still buy her perfumes 20 years later. Hook them as a kid, and you never get rid of them.\u201d (Disclosure: this writer previously worked on staff at Popsugar with Johnson.)\n\n\u201c Britney Spears fans still buy her perfumes 20 years later. Hook them as a kid, and you never get rid of them \u201d \u2014 Kirbie Johnson\n\nRarely are celebrities real perfumers; most of their money from the ventures comes from simply licensing their name. \u201cUsually the development process has nothing to do with the person,\u201d Weingarten explained. \u201cMaybe someone will bring it to them in a meeting with 17 other items on the agenda and have them sign it off.\u201d\n\nRecently, Johnson heard that a celebrity\u2014whose name she declined to disclose\u2014was starting her own skincare line. She reached out to the star\u2019s representatives for comment.\n\nAccording to Johnson, \u201cThe team responded saying they didn\u2019t have much information yet, because they didn\u2019t know if the brand was going to be something she did on her own, or if she was just going to put her name on something. Obviously, those are two really different things.\u201d\n\nThe next generation of celebrity makeup moguls take a more hands-on approach\u2014or at least make a point of telling the world that they are doing so. Rihanna has said that Fenty\u2019s much-praised range of foundation shades were her idea, and that she wanted to \u201cmake sure everyone was included.\u201d\n\nAn interview with Lady Gaga published this week in The Business of Fashion highlights the singer\u2019s acumen, saying she \u201cassembled\u201d the Haus Beauty team on her own. She also refers to her investor-funded company as a \u201cstart-up.\u201d A video posted to the brand\u2019s Instagram page shows seemingly behind-the-scenes footage of Gaga at work in an office, looking very much like an overworked founder in a messy bun and thick black sunglasses.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve developed products for celebrities, and I can tell you that they\u2019re not as involved as they think they are,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cI haven\u2019t worked with Lady Gaga. But let\u2019s say there\u2019s a celebrity named Lady Lala, and I developed a brand with her. I would say, \u2018You love this suede texture,\u2019 and then develop it. Later, I\u2019d tell them, \u2018Remember, you had the idea for the texture. It\u2019s ego-stroking.\u201d\n\n\u201c Twenty years ago, the only celebs with their own skincare lines were former soap stars selling on infomercials. Now, we heave peak, prestige Madonna selling it \u201d\n\nAs beauty product swell into an $18 billion industry, those egos inflate, too. \u201cTwenty years ago, the only celebs with their own skincare lines were former soap stars selling on infomercials,\u201d Cheryl Kramer Kaye, a veteran beauty editor, wrote in an email. \u201cNow, we heave peak, prestige Madonna selling it.\u201d\n\nAnd why wouldn\u2019t she? Sure, Madonna isn\u2019t struggling to make rent, but she could be eyeing a way to make money that is less grueling than nonstop tours.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer kids going into a record store to buy their latest album once every few years,\u201d Weingarten mused. \u201cBut if they use Lady Gaga lip gloss, she\u2019s on their mind everyday. It\u2019s like producing something that makes people feel that concert feeling\u2014oh, wow\u2014on their face.\u201d", "description": "Lady Gaga said the world doesn\u2019t need anymore makeup lines.
