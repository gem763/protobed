Luxury automakers have certainly shown themselves to not be immune to the growing electric vehicles trend, as luxury brands such as Mercedes-Benz and Porsche are rolling out their own electric luxury cars. Meanwhile, even high-end luxury and performance car brands like Rolls Royce and Bugatti have also teased releasing their own electric vehicles in the future. These offerings are meant to compete with the popularity of Tesla's Model S, the electric automaker's luxury sedan that has a starting price of $75,000, but can cost up to nearly $115,000 with extra options like extended range and \"Ludicrous Mode\" for upgraded acceleration. (Tesla also has plans to reintroduce its luxury electric Roadster sports car, with an expected price tag above $200,000, in 2020.)\n\nHere's a look at three of the most expensive luxury electric cars on the market that represent some of Tesla's biggest competition.\n\n2020 Porsche Taycan (up to $185,000)\n\nThe 2020 Porsche Taycan electric sports car.

The Porsche Taycan is a four-door sports car that starts at $150,900, while the more powerful Turbo S version can cost up to $185,000.\n\nThe interior of Porsche's Taycan electric sports car.

By comparison, Tesla's Model S cars can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 2.4 seconds, though CEO Elon Musk claims the next generation Roadster will be able to do so in 2.1 seconds. The Taycan also expects a range of about 250 miles, CNBC previously reported.\n\n2019 BMW i8 Roadster ($163,300)\n\nBMW's i8 Roadster electric convertible with butterfly doors.

The German automaker's first-ever electric roadster doesn't match the power of Porsche's Taycan, with the i8 Roadster coming with an electric motor with 364 horsepower and a 0 to 60 mph time of 4.4 seconds, according to BMW.\n\nBMW's electric i8 Roadster rear view.

The 2020 Aston Martin Rapide E will reportedly cost roughly $255,000, according to Jalopnik, and the car will start off with a limited production run of just 155 vehicles, the company said in its press release.", "description": "More and more luxury electric cars are rolling onto the market as automakers like Porsche and Aston Martin look to compete with the likes of Tesla.", "authors": ["Tom Huddleston Jr."], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106141453-1569002923097evporsche_taycan_turbo_2019_porsche_ag.jpg?v=1569003053"}
