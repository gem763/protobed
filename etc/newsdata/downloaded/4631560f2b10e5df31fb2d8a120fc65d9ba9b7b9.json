It is most complete in California.\n\nThe system does not predict earthquakes. Rather, it uses numerous seismic stations to detect the start of an earthquake and light-speed communications to send the data to computers that instantly calculate location, magnitude, intensity of shaking and create alerts to be distributed to areas that will be affected.\n\nDepending on distance from the epicenter, the alerts may give warnings of several seconds to a minute before shaking arrives at a given location \u2014 enough time to duck under desks, pull a knife away from a surgical patient or shut down elevators, trains and industrial processes.\n\nAfter lengthy testing, alerts were made broadly available to businesses, utilities, schools and other entities last year. The only large-scale public notification is in Los Angeles County, where an alerting app developed for the city of Los Angeles hasn't been triggered yet.\n\nThe MyShake system maintains a database of which cellphones are in 10-kilometer-by-10-kilometer (6.2-mile-by-6.2-mile) cell grids and pushes the alerts to phones in zones where at least level 3 shaking will occur, so receiving an alert is not based on which tower the phone is communicating with, Allen said.\n\nThe Wireless Emergency Alerts system, known as WEA, operates slightly differently.\n\nWEA creates polygons that include cellphone towers, said Ryan Arba chief of the seismic hazards branch of the Office of Emergency Services.\n\n\"If your phone is currently communicating with that cell tower, the message will be broadcast to your phone,\" he said.\n\nA person will get an alert if they are outside a polygon but their phone is communicating with a tower inside the polygon, he said.\n\nArba said none of the alerting systems are perfect, and it may also be possible that people feel quakes without receiving alerts.\n\n\"When live alerts go out, we'll know how the system performs from the alert distribution side, which is something we have no visibility into now,\" he said.\n\nThe developers expect to improve the system through experience.\n\nMost recently, the MyShake system was tested this week by a magnitude 4.5 quake in the San Francisco Bay Area and a 4.7 in central California. The median times from detection to alerts hitting phones was 2.1 seconds and 1.6 seconds, respectively, Allen said.\n\n\"An important caveat here is this is measuring delivery of alerts to a relatively small number of phones, not to the millions of phones that we will want to do in a big earthquake with many more people having the app. But this is encouraging,\" Allen said.\n\nThe Los Angeles app was criticized because it did not alert users when two powerful earthquakes struck an area of the Mojave Desert more than 100 miles north of the city on July 4 and 5.\n\nExperts said the goal was to alert people who might experience potentially damaging shaking rather than simply feel some shaking. But the city later announced the threshold will be lowered to alert of \"weak\" shaking.", "description": "Earthquake early warning alerts will become publicly available throughout California for the first time this week, potentially giving people time to protect themselves from harm, the Governor's Office of Emergency Services said Wednesday.
