He\u2019s trying to persuade European Union leaders to strike an elusive divorce deal with Britain, while also laying the groundwork for a post-Brexit trade agreement with the United States - seen by the government as one of the main prizes of Brexit.\n\nThe Conservative prime minister is keen to forge a strong relationship with the Republican president, who has called the British leader \u201ca really good man.\u201d\n\nBut Johnson told reporters flying with him to New York that he would tell Trump \u201cthat when we do a free trade deal, we must take sure that the (National Health Service) is not on the table, that we do not in any way prejudice or jeopardize our standards on animal welfare and food hygiene in the course of that deal, and that we open up American markets.\u201d\n\nOpponents of Brexit fear the NHS - an overstretched but much-loved institution founded in 1948 to provide free health care to all Britons - will be opened up to private U.S. firms as part of trade negotiations. They also have suggested Britain may have to accept chlorine-washed chicken, a U.S. poultry industry practice that is banned in the European Union.\n\nJohnson is likely to be dogged by Britain\u2019s divisive - and stalled - departure from the EU throughout his three-day trip to the U.N.\u2019s annual gathering of world leaders.\n\nMore than three years after Britain voted to leave the EU, the departure date has been postponed twice, and the U.K. Parliament has repeatedly rejected the only divorce deal offered. The country is facing a chaotic exit on Oct. 31 unless Johnson\u2019s government can, against the odds, secure a new agreement - or arrange another delay, something Johnson vows he will not do.\n\nThe British leader is seeking to persuade a skeptical European Union to give Britain a new divorce deal before the U.K. is due to leave the bloc on Oct. 31. He is scheduled to hold talks at the U.N. with EU leaders, including European Council President Donald Tusk, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar.\n\nJohnson said he didn\u2019t think there would be a \u201cNew York breakthrough,\u201d but he was encouraged by the progress talks had made since he took office less than two months ago. He replaced Theresa May, who resigned in failure after her EU withdrawal agreement was rejected three times by Parliament.\n\n\u201cIf you think about when I first became prime minister, everybody was saying there\u2019s absolutely no chance whatever of changing the existing agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think nobody\u2019s saying that (now).\u201d\n\n\u201cI think a large number of the important partners really do want a deal,\u201d he said.\n\nBut many leaders of the 28-nation bloc mistrust Johnson, a brash Brexit champion who played a big role in persuading British voters in 2016 to opt to leave the EU. And they say Britain has not come up with workable ways to maintain an open border between EU member Ireland and the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland - the key sticking point in the dispute. An open border underpins both the local economy and the peace process that ended years of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe U.K. says the border can be kept free of customs posts and other obstacles through a mix of as-yet unproven technology and an all-Ireland zone for animals and agricultural products.\n\n\u201cWhat we are working for is a solution that enables the U.K. and the EU to respect the principles of the (EU) single market \u2026 to allow an open border in Northern Ireland; to respect the achievements of the Northern Irish peace process; but also to allow the whole of the U.K. to come out of the EU,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd there is a way to do that. I think colleagues around the table in Brussels can see how we might do that. All it will take is a political will to get there.\u201d\n\nJohnson is also facing claims that during his tenure as mayor of London between 2008 and 2016, he gave public money and places on overseas U.K. trade trips to a close friend running a startup business. He refused to comment to reporters when asked repeatedly about the allegations, first reported in the Sunday Times newspaper.\n\nThe British government is also bracing for a Supreme Court ruling on whether Johnson broke the law when he suspended Parliament for five weeks ahead of the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline.\n\nJohnson says the suspension was a routine measure to prepare for a new session of Parliament. Opponents claim he acted illegally to stop lawmakers from interfering with his plan to leave the EU, with or without a Brexit deal.\n\nThe 11 justices say they will rule early this week. A ruling that the suspension was illegal would be a huge blow to Johnson\u2019s authority and could see lawmakers recalled to Parliament immediately.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at: https://www.apnews.com/Brexit\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he'll tell U.S. President Donald Trump that the U.K.'s state-funded health service will be off the table in any future trade negotiations, and that the U.S. will have to open its markets to British goods if it wants to make a deal.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jill Lawless"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/un_general_assembly_brexit_62945_c0-144-3456-2159_s1770x1032.jpg?2c19604d885e8234cad5e326a78b816736af2750", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
