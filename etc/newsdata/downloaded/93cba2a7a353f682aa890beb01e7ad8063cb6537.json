In the 12 years since then, it has grown to over $500 million.\n\nHundreds of millions of dollars in assets don't just happen upon portfolio managers. It's safe to say the firm is doing something extraordinary to have swelled to roughly 3,968 times its original size.\n\nDev Kantesaria, Valley Forge's founder and portfolio manager, attributes the firm's explosive growth rate to the adherence of strict investment principles and a long time horizon.\n\n\"We believe that the only way to outperform is a concentrated portfolio of your best ideas,\" he said. \"Why would you want to invest in your 15th-best idea?\n\n\"A lot of portfolio managers are either taught or believe that they have to have 25, 30, 40, 50 names in their portfolio, which is absolute silliness.\"\n\nThis idea is at odds with the age-old investment advice that a well-diversified portfolio is the key to long-term success, but Kantesaria stresses that his point is mathematically sound. He notes that the more is added to a portfolio, the harder it becomes for an investor to one-up the market.\n\nFor that reason, he holds just eight to 12 individual issues at a time. And to make sure he's investing in only the best of the best, he focuses on value and assesses potential purchases with rigorous vetting and analysis.\n\nRead more: 'It's going to 30,000': A CIO who oversees $4.9 billion explains why the Dow is headed for fresh record highs \u2014 and shares his top 4 stock picks for the upswing\n\n\"We buy companies that are generally monopolies or oligopolies in their respective industries,\" he said. \"They have highly predictable earnings on a going-forward basis, they have strong organic growth \u2014 in contrast to most value investors who buy cigar-butt stocks.\"\n\nFor the uninitiated, a cigar-butt stock is a rundown issue that has only one or two \"puffs\" left in it.\n\nIf this strategy is starting to sound familiar, it's because the world's best-known investor, Warren Buffett, used a similar strategy to build his investment empire. Buffett purchases only companies with strong cash flows, high barriers to entry, a competitive moat, strong management, and a proven track record of success.\n\nKantesaria's approach is cut from the same cloth \u2014 and his swelling asset base suggests similar success.\n\nLike Buffett, Kantesaria is also not concerned with the day-to-day fluctuations of the market, trade war, elections, or interest rates. His long time horizon leaves him immune to short-term hiccups and emotional market swings, things to which many investors often fall prey.\n\nIn addition to the attributes above, Kantesaria also assesses the company's pricing power and volume growth as well as whether the product or service is essential and how nimble the cost structure is.\n\nSome of his favorites are Fair Isaac (FICO), Moody's (MCO), Visa (V), and Mastercard (MA).\n\nOnce he buys, he holds for at least 10 years unless it reaches full value or a risk value changes.\n\n\"I'm actually not concerned with anything on the equity side,\" he said. \"If you're a long-term optimist about America and our economy, then I think today is a great entry point for the long-term investor.\"\n\nHe concluded: \"Despite almost a 10-year bull market in equities, despite a positive year-to-date performance in equities, we're quite bullish on owning equities today.\"", "description": "Dev Kantesaria describes how his investment philosophy grew his firm's assets under management by over 3,968 times in the past 12 years.", "authors": ["Christopher Competiello"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8d19ab2e22af0ba2191561?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
