They had to fill out what the occupation they wanted to be was, and he wrote chef or actor,' Curtis explained.\n\n'My wife and I looked at each other like, \"I don't want him to be a chef\", \"I don't want him to be an actor\". It's quite confronting,' he joked.\n\nReflecting on his own career, the Michelin star chef said: 'It's served me very well but it's a tough job. It's hard to be an independent business owner in the restaurant business, but it's also made all my dreams come true.'\n\nFollowing in his footsteps: 'My oldest son who's nearly eight, just had a careers day. They had to fill out what the occupation they wanted to be was, and he wrote chef or actor,' Curtis said. Hudson (right) is pictured with brother Emerson, five (left)\n\nCurtis added that the hospitality industry has taught him 'a lot of good and bad' and that it's easy to become very 'one-dimensional' in the kitchen.\n\n'I've worked for tough chefs my whole life. It's easy to become a really tough chef, but then you have to sort of remove yourself from the kitchen.\n\n'Some are just chefs and that's that. They live their whole life as a chef, but I also run a couple of other businesses,' he continued.\n\nIn the family: Curtis recalled looking at Lindsay and thinking, 'I don't want him to be a chef'\n\nCurtis arrived in Sydney this week to launch the new Christmas range from Supermarket chain Coles, and hosted an event at Three Blue Ducks restaurant.\n\nThe TV presenter began planning the Christmas recipes from June, and shot the campaign earlier this year.\n\n'It's great from a family perspective as I get to revisit all the stuff I did a few months ago,' Curtis told Daily Mail Australia.\n\nAmbassador: Curtis arrived in Sydney this week to launch the new Christmas range from Supermarket chain Coles, and hosted an event at Three Blue Ducks restaurant\n\n'I start talking to my wife and the family about what we're going to do for Christmas lunch. I can cheat as I've got a good body of work to work from.'\n\nCurtis, who is now based in Los Angeles, said Coles' produce is just as great as American produce, and his kitchen staples change according to the seasons.\n\n'I've got a big veggie garden at home so I can literally pick in the afternoon, but we eat very seasonally as a family. I try and encourage whoever shops, whether it's me, my wife, my mother-in-law, to sort of stay within those seasons.'\n\n'And I want my kids to be really into food,' he added. 'We have a butcher shop nearby so there's always delicious meats in the fridge, and we like to eat seafood.'", "description": "He shares sons Hudson, seven, and Emerson, five, with actress wife Lindsay Price.", "authors": ["Kristy Johnson For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/09/19730314-0-image-a-25_1571127874330.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
