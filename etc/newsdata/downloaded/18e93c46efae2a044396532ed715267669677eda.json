The report is adapted from his new book, Holding the Line: Inside Trump\u2019s Pentagon With Secretary Mattis.\n\nMr Snodgrass said Mr Trump \u201cburst out in the middle of the meeting\u201d and began to describe his recent visit to France, where he met President Emanuel Macron and attended the country\u2019s Bastille Day celebrations.\n\n\u201cI just returned from France,\u201d the president said, according to Mr Snodgrass. \u201cDid you see President Macron\u2019s handshake? \u2026 He wouldn\u2019t let go. He just kept holding on. I spent two hours at Bastille Day. Very impressive.\u201d\n\nThe president reportedly went on to say that he wanted a \u201cVictory Day\u201d celebration similar to the event he witnessed in France, adding: \u201cThe Fourth of July is too hot\u201d.\n\n\u201cI want vehicles and tanks on Main Street. On Pennsylvania Avenue, from the Capitol to the White House. We need spirit! We should blow everybody away with this parade,\u201d the president reportedly said. \u201cThe French had an amazing parade on Bastille Day with tanks and everything. Why can\u2019t we do that?\u201d\n\nThe former speech writer, who helped Mr Mattis prepare for briefings with the president, said he learned to only bring \u201cslides with pictures \u2026 no words\u201d to future meetings with Mr Trump.\n\n\u201cTrump veered from topic to topic\u2014Syria, Mexico, a recent Washington Post story he didn\u2019t like\u2014like a squirrel caught in traffic, dashing one way and then another,\u201d Mr Snodgrass wrote. \u201cThe issues were complicated, yet all of the president\u2019s answers were simplistic and ad hoc. He was shooting from the hip on issues of global importance.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s aides have previously acknowledged he prefers pictures and videos with \u201ckiller graphics\u201d compared to words in his daily intelligence briefings.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our task, right?\u201d then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo said in a Washington Post report published in 2017. \u201cTo deliver the material in a way that he can best understand the information we\u2019re trying to communicate.\u201d\n\nIt was also previously reported that Mr Trump was enamoured by France\u2019s Bastille Day celebrations and had ordered his own US military parade shortly after.\n\nStill, Mr Snodgrass\u2019 account provides an inside look at how Pentagon officials and others were aware of those claims about the president long before they were published in the national media.\n\nHe said Mr Trump \u201cscowled\u201d when his defence secretary spoke in excessive detail, but was energised by \u201ca visual depiction\u201d of US forces in between Japan and South Korea.\n\nBut the president reportedly veered off track, calling the nation\u2019s trade agreements \u201ccriminal\u201d and adding: \u201cJapan and South Korea are taking advantage of the United States.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nTrump misspells his defence secretary\u2019s name in rambling rant", "description": "Donald Trump could not appear to focus during his first briefing of his presidency with top-level officials at the Pentagon, according to a stunning new account written by former Defence Secretary James Mattis\u2019 chief speech writer.Guy Snodgrass, who served as Mr Mattis\u2019 speech writer until the former", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.xyXb0js8bvjQZbaJIAxUA--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/9b0292a59b896a81104ac52ebebb711c", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
