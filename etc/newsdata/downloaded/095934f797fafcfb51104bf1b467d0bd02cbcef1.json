REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci/File Photo\n\nThe central bank is now authorized to restrict purchases of dollars as it burns through its reserves in an effort to prop up the peso currency, the government said in a decree published in its official bulletin.\n\nThe measure means companies will need permission from the central bank to access the foreign exchange market to purchase foreign currency and make transfers abroad.\n\nThe government of Latin America\u2019s third largest economy said in the decree that \u201cthe executive branch needed to adopt a series of extraordinary measures aimed at ensuring the normal functioning of the economy.\u201d\n\nHours after the decree was published, a spokesman for the International Monetary Fund, with which Argentina has a $57-billion standby agreement, said its staff were analyzing Argentina\u2019s \u201ccapital flow management measures with the aim of protecting exchange rate stability and the savers.\u201d\n\n\u201cStaff will remain in close contact with the authorities in the period ahead and the Fund will continue to stand with Argentina during these challenging times,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nAfter opposition candidate Alberto Fernandez and Fernandez de Kirchner, who is now his vice presidential candidate, pulled off a stunning upset in the Aug. 11 primary vote, bonds, stocks and the peso currency plummeted on market fears over a potential return to the interventionist policies of Fernandez de Kirchner\u2019s previous government.\n\nMacri\u2019s government and the central bank are trying to stabilize the economy as the Oct. 27 presidential election looms, for which Fernandez is now the front-runner.\n\nThe central bank has burned through nearly $1 billion in reserves since Wednesday in an effort to prop up the peso. But the intervention did not have the desired impact and risk spreads blew out to levels not seen since 2005, while the local peso currency extended its year-to-date swoon to 36%.\n\nThe central bank said in a statement that the measure did not limit people from withdrawing dollars from their accounts. It does, however, restrict people from buying more than $10,000 a month, or making transfers exceeding that amount per month.\n\nIt also requires exporters to liquidate their foreign exchange earnings in the local market under deadlines. Companies will not be permitted to stockpile dollars, the bank said.\n\n\u201c(Foreign) trade is not restricted. There were restrictions before, but there are none now,\u201d said a source familiar with the new central bank measure.\n\n\u201cAll of this is to preserve the economy as well as possible in this circumstance,\u201d said the source, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nTreasury Minister Hernan Lacunza called the measures \u201cuncomfortable\u201d in an interview with a local TV station on Sunday evening, but said they were necessary for avoiding a worse situation.\n\n\u201cThey are not measures for a normal country,\u201d the minister said.\n\n\u201cIf we do not do it, the consequences would be serious.\u201d\n\nIn another TV interview, Lacunza said an exchange rate of 61 pesos per U.S. dollar would be \u201cexcessive\u201d.\n\nThe peso closed at 59.52 per dollar on Friday.\n\n\u2018UNPALATABLE MEASURES\u2019\n\nThe central bank announced on Friday that banks would need to seek prior authorization before distributing their earnings, in order to \u201cavoid any lack of money\u201d and safeguard the liquidity of Argentina\u2019s financial system.\n\nLast week, Lacunza said the government would negotiate with holders of its sovereign bonds and the IMF to extend the maturities of its debt obligations as a way of ensuring Argentina\u2019s ability to pay.\n\nA team from the IMF was in Argentina last week to meet with government and central bank officials, as well as Fernandez and his economic advisers.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s next scheduled review of Argentina\u2019s lending program is on Sept. 15.\n\nWorries over Argentina\u2019s ability to meet its dollar-denominated debt obligations have increased since the Aug. 11 primary.\n\n\u201cAs Macri\u2019s government runs out of options, it will most likely have to resort to very unpalatable measures that most adult Argentines hoped they would never experience again,\u201d said Emilio Ocampo, an independent economist and consultant.\n\n\u201cWe are in a gray area, and from Friday until today, it got darker. It may get even darker if confidence is not restored.\u201d\n\nFernandez de Kirchner, in office from 2007 to 2015, clamped down on access to U.S. dollars in a bid to protect the central bank\u2019s precarious reserves.", "description": "Argentina's government authorized currency controls on Sunday in an about-face by President Mauricio Macri, who had previously lifted many protectionist practices of his predecessor, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.", "authors": ["Cassandra Garrison", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190901&t=2&i=1425133216&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF801Y8"}
