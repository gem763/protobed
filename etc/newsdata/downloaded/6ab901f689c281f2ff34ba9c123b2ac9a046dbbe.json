He is also in a better physical condition than at the beginning of the season.\u201d\n\nBen Yedder grabbed the only goal after 22 minutes when he picked up a pass from Alexsandr Golovin, resisted a challenge from full-back Fabio before unleashing a fierce right foot drive into the roof of the net.\n\nThe French star thought he had a second just six minutes later when he found the target after an incisive pass from Algeria\u2019s on-loan Islam Slimani.\n\nHowever, Ben Yedder had strayed offside and the goal was ruled out.\n\nNantes were just a whisker from equalising in first-half stoppage time but Mali international striker Kalifa Coulibaly\u2019s close-range header was well-saved by Monaco goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte.\n\nFive minutes into the second half, Coulibaly was again unfortunate when his shot from a tight angle came back off the post of Lecomte.\n\nOn the hour mark, Ben Yedder had the ball in the net again but it was scrubbed off by VAR after Slimani was penalised in the build-up for offside.", "description": "Nantes (France) (AFP) \u2013 Prolific striker Wissam Ben Yedder grabbed his ninth goal of the season as Monaco handed Nantes their first home Ligue 1", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/9f5bc8_monaco-striker-wissam-ben-yedder-celebrates-his-opener-teammate-gelson-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
