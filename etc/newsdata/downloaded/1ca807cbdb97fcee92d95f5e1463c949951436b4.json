The adverts are being funded by European Livestock Voice, which is backed by organisations representing EU farmers, foie gras producers and the fur and leather industry.\n\n\u201cWe believe this campaign is necessary in order to address misinformation,\u201d said a spokesperson for Livestock Voice. The group wants people \u201cto think about the whole picture and all the consequences that simplistic speeches calling, for instance, for a \u2018drastic reduction of livestock\u2019 could have on Europe\u2019s rural areas and on society in general.\u201d\n\nThe campaign group says the current debate around meat and livestock has been one-sided, and livestock\u2019s contribution to biodiversity, bioenergy and the rural economy overlooked. \u201cAn EU without livestock would not only lose locally produced food, but also essential habitats and biodiversity. It would also mean increased fires, lack of natural fertiliser and green energy, and a rural exodus,\u201d it says.\n\nEurope's meat and dairy production must halve by 2050, expert warns Read more\n\nEuropeans eat more than twice as much meat as experts recommend. A report last year called for a 40\u201350% reduction in the size of Europe\u2019s meat and livestock sector to reduce its environmental footprint.\n\nResearch published in Nature journal last year concluded that beef consumption in western countries needs to fall by 90% in order to avoid dangerous climate change. The livestock sector is believed to be responsible for a minimum of 14.5% of global carbon emissions.\n\nBut the new campaign group said that the livestock sector accounts for less than 6% of the EU\u2019s total climate emissions.\n\n\n\nReplacing animal products with plant-based alternatives is not the universal solution to climate change, it maintains, as alternative foodstuffs have environmental footprints of their own. Replacing fossil fuels with green alternatives was a more effective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, they said.\n\nMichael Lee, professor in sustainable agriculture at Rothamsted Research in Hertfordshire, one of the oldest agricultural research institutions in the world, said current eating habits were not sustainable, but livestock still had an important role to play.\n\n\u201cComplete removal of livestock would be a disaster for agriculture sustainability, the long-term environment due to loss of grassland, rural communities and for human health as not every vegan can be a selective nutritionist. Equally our current consumption levels are a disaster \u2013 with growing obesity and environmental damage due to high levels of emissions.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe solution lies in a more plant-dominated diet but with a modest amount of high-quality livestock product (as part of a circular economy) \u2013 which is valued for the key nutrients it contains, its soil-improving properties and the landscape we all want to support and live in,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the European Livestock Voice said:\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is well known that a section of the European population over consume animal products, but there is no evidence to suggest that reducing production will lead to any decrease in consumption. The consequences of a drastic reduction on consumption of animal products by replacing them with \u2018meat substitutes\u2019 or other activities could well be worse than the benefits of meat consumption, without leading to a significant environmental or health improvement.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "description": "An EU without farmed animals would see a loss of biodiversity and spark a rural exodus, new campaign group claims", "authors": ["Tom Levitt"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d7d8330ea35d0b681dc16eb5608e05731c3f726/0_52_1514_908/master/1514.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a841cc02f79bd7858c53353613acd5e1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
