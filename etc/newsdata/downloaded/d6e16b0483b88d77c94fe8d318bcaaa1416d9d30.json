It really is this bad", "language": "en", "text": "To answer the two questions you\u2019ll be asking about 20 minutes into Netflix\u2019s new castaway thriller The I-Land:\n\n1) They tell you how the 10 strangers with wiped memories came to wake up simultaneously on a desert island at the start of episode three, so skip there if you just want to know before you quit;\n\n2) No, this isn\u2019t some deadpan spoof of bad sci-fi, with the lumpen writing, catatonic acting and thuddingly inelegant plotting there to make a postmodern point. It\u2019s really as bad as it initially seems.\n\nWell, almost. Once The I-Land does reveal its hand \u2013 basically it\u2019s Lost meets The Matrix, although there\u2019s a lot less to it than that \u2013 it improves purely by dint of making us wonder what handbrake turn into a new field of randomness it\u2019ll perform next. Moreover, nothing can be as poor as the bewilderingly disastrous opening episodes.\n\nWritten and directed by Neil LaBute \u2013 once an enfant terrible of US indie cinema with films such as In the Company of Men, now better known for TV vampire-dystopia romp Van Helsing \u2013 episode one is a lesson in how not to pilot. The first meeting between feisty Chase (Natalie Martinez) and glassy, pessimistic fellow castaway KC (Kate Bosworth, who talks throughout as if she\u2019s being fed unfamiliar lines through an earpiece) sets the tone: instead of conflict occurring organically as an extraordinary predicament is explored, everyone is just pissy with each other, like characters in a soap nursing trivial grudges \u2013 or perhaps just shallow millennials as imagined by a fiftysomething writer.\n\nOne of many baffling sequences sees a young woman breezily put aside her worrying new circumstances to enjoy a spot of sunbathing: meanwhile the heroine Martinez, who does her best with the clumsy dialogue (\u201cI just don\u2019t know where \u2018where\u2019 is!\u201d) exists in a low-cut vest top that\u2019s often wet and at one point struggles to cope with a Baywatch-style running slo-mo. The treatment of an attempted rape is queasy too, as it merely leads to more of the same empty shouting and moody stares into the middle distance.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Stranded on a supernatural desert island?

Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix\n\nThe flimsy script is more often hilarious than offensive, though: nobody in 2019 should be given the line \u201cI have a bad feeling about this!\u201d, but to have someone say it right after a character has been eaten by a shark suggests LaBute and his colleagues were not even trying.\n\nThe I-Land certainly isn\u2019t worried about negative comparisons to Lost. It wilfully invites them, setting up a crude version of the Jack-Kate-Sawyer triangle, quickly hinting that the desert island is somehow malignly sentient, and even trying to get a spooky numerology thing going. It also indulges in explanatory flashbacks, but since it can\u2019t use them as Lost did, to add further nuance to the island-dwellers\u2019 characters \u2013 because it has no plausible characters \u2013 they\u2019re dumped on us at the halfway point, arriving like a series of lurid Lifetime melodramas about people with reasons to feel guilty.\n\nExactly what kind of purgatory these protagonists are in is where The I-Land leaves Lost behind to explore more futuristic, tech-horror territory. As it does so, the absurdities intensify, right up to a twist ending that\u2019s almost magnificent in its will-this-do lack of relevance to what has come before. This is sci-fi without a vision, a genre piece that doesn\u2019t know how its own genre works. The I-Land is begging to be forgotten.", "description": "Ten strangers wake on a desert island with wiped memories in Netflix\u2019s catastrophically dire new show.
