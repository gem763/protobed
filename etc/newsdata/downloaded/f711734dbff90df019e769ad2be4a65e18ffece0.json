Not anymore. At this point in his career, he apparently feels he has to push the boundaries of everything the moving picture format can do and be. The Taiwanese director\u2019s 2012 film Life of Pi heralded the arrival of a new era for him, a period of big-budget experimentation that\u2019s yielded as many bafflements as wonders. His adaptation of the book club favorite went well enough, winning four Oscars for its spectacular menagerie of CGI beasties. His big gamble with Billy Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk in 2016 didn\u2019t pay the same dividends, though. Lee\u2019s foray into 120 frames-per-second shooting, combined with depth-of-field-obliterating 3D cinematography, made for a perfect storm of visual disorientation. It was the kind of ride that makes viewers clutch at their armrests, desperate to escape.\n\nLee claims to have worked out the kinks in the process for Gemini Man, his latest attempt to blow open the walls of cinematic hyperreality. This time around, he\u2019s having another go at 120fps, and the 3D projection has had three years to play technological catch-up with Lee\u2019s futuristic vision. But the most E Ink has been spilled over his successful cloning of Will Smith. Smith stars in the film opposite his early-twenties self, de-aged to his Fresh Prince years with the help of cutting-edge motion-capture technology.\n\nOf Lee\u2019s many gambits in Gemini Man, the digital character-doubling works the best. Smith the Younger emotes with an organically recognizable humanity from under his weird digital mask, and Smith pitches his voice up a few semitones to play his younger self, which takes viewers over the age of 18 right back to his West Philadelphia days. Smith has chemistry with himself, particularly in the scenes of hand-to-hand combat. (They\u2019re a welcome reminder that nearly 20 years ago, Lee gave us the world-class wuxia epic Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.)\n\nThe same praise can\u2019t be heaped on the eyeball-searing camerawork, which suggests an unholy cross between a white-knuckle telenovela and high-octane VR porno. In theory, running more images at a faster rate should make for more fluid images, rendering the gap between the movie and actual vision so small as to be negligible. In practice, it feels like watching TV on your parents\u2019 new flat-screen that came with auto-activated motion smoothing. (Which is still bad.) The judder of good ol\u2019 24fps may be a \u201cflaw\u201d in the most rigid sense of the concept, but that imperfection has been integrated into the moviegoing public\u2019s innate understanding of the medium. Lee\u2019s quixotic efforts to drag multiplexes into the next dimension have forged an off-putting visual artifice that makes it nearly impossible to get lost in a film \u2014 or even just get into it.\n\nSome of the film\u2019s issues, though, might be owed to a thick-headed script that clashes with the forward-thinking industry intellect applied to its production. Audiences at theaters other than the dozen or so featuring 120fps projection will have a slightly easier time sifting for the story buried in here somewhere, a thin science-fiction-inflected potboiler pitting an assassin against his own genetic duplicate.\n\nSmith gives off an \u201cI\u2019m getting too old for this shit\u201c vibe as Henry Brogan, an expert operative for a shadowy government agency. He\u2019s ready to hang up his sniper scope, but a hit squad shows up just after he announces his retirement, and they\u2019re soon followed by the Ghost of Flat-Tops Past. Henry gets the sense that his former handlers aren\u2019t just trying to stiff him out of a pension, but the film primes viewers for a revelation that never really comes. Its meaningful progression isn\u2019t in Henry\u2019s secrets, but in the development of his relationship with his doppelg\u00e4nger, \u201cJunior.\u201d\n\nWhile Junior\u2019s controller, Clay (Clive Owen) pushes to keep his mission on track, Henry and Junior gradually, reluctantly take up a father-son dynamic that vacillates between absurd (particularly in the incongruously mushy final act) and poignant (as the older Smith muses on regret and chances not taken). For a film fine-tuned in pursuit of audiovisual perfection, this thing is full of narrative glitches, story elements that half work and half don\u2019t.\n\nHenry\u2019s primary operative partner Dani (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), for instance, feels like a romantic interest stripped of the romance during the latest rewrite of this 20-year-old script, due to the glaring age disparity between the stars. Benedict Wong shows up as comic relief, delightful in a film that has no use for him beyond his purely functionary capacity as tension-breaker. Every moment staged as a big reveal either turns out to be something the audience already knew, or had most likely intuited.\n\nBut an effects showcase like this is supposed to come alive in the kinetic sequences, and for 10-second stretches at a time, Lee\u2019s mad dream of an evolved cinema appears to be within his reach. Applied sparingly, 120fps\u2019 complete lack of motion blur can have an exhilarating artistic effect. One impressive tracking shot slides frictionlessly through a tight alley with the full-body lurch of Star Wars\u2019 jump into hyperspace. It\u2019s easy to see why the promotion foregrounded the first confrontation between Henry and his double. It\u2019s a bravura face-off with no-holds-barred fight choreography that culminates with Smith somehow firing a motorcycle at his older self.\n\nIt\u2019s enough to make viewers long for the days when Lee knew better than to put the technical cart before the creative horse. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon let the director pursue his wildest gravity-defying whims, without using the screenplay solely as scaffolding for his fancy gadgetry. Lee sometimes gives the impression of a virtuoso guitarist, needlessly gussying up his act with double-necked axes and pyrotechnics. When a filmmaker has skills like Lee\u2019s, all the bells and whistles just seem to get in the way. God willing, his acoustic days aren\u2019t totally behind him.", "description": "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon director Ang Lee is breaking technological boundaries again with Gemini Man, which has current Will Smith facing a de-aged digital duplicate of himself, sent to assassinate him.
