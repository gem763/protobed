He smuggled footage dating back to 2017 out of the prison and titled the documentary \u201cBehind Tha Barb Wire.\u201d The video \u2014 given to the Miami Herald \u2014 allows the public to see with their own eyes the violence, rampant drug use and appalling conditions inside the prison.\n\nAs the Herald previously reported, Florida prisons have gone to great lengths to withhold video footage and other documents from news outlets, as well as family members of inmates who have died in custody.\n\nTo keep from releasing records, the agency has cited medical privacy laws and legal exemptions; sharing video footage specifically, it said, could jeopardize a facility\u2019s security system and endanger prison personnel.\n\nWhitney\u2019s film, perhaps, underscored other reasons Florida\u2019s Department of Corrections is keeping videos and records under wraps.\n\n[Why prisoner abuse and deprivation persists in America]\n\nWe\u2019re going to \u201cshow y\u2019all \u2026 how we live in here that y\u2019all ain\u2019t seen,\u201d said one inmate participating in the documentary.\n\nFrom scene to scene, Whitney\u2019s footage revealed an unkempt and decaying environment and demonstrates a lack of attention by some corrections officers.\n\nIn one nighttime video narrated by Whitney in a hushed voice, a guard passed by his prison cell carrying a flashlight, yet never glanced inside. He remained oblivious to Whitney, who was openly filming at the time.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t check to see if we\u2019re living. They don\u2019t check to see if we\u2019re safe,\u201d Whitney said.\n\nThe video confirmed that homemade weapons and violence are hallmarks of life at Martin Correctional Institution, which the Herald said had 31 deaths in the past six years, including five homicides. Whitney modeled a makeshift stab-proof vest for the camera in one scene; in others, prisoners held a homemade knife and a \u201clock-and-belt weapon.\u201d\n\nThe film documented mold covering the kitchen and mice popping in through crumbling walls. It also memorialized Hurricane Irma in 2017, when inmates from other prisons were transported to and housed at the facility, sleeping on the floor.\n\nMost saliently, though, it captured the widespread drug use inside the prison.\n\n\u201cYou got the war on drugs on the street, but once we get here, you don\u2019t care about the drugs,\u201d he said to the camera.\n\nScene after scene showed inmates slumped over, stumbling to the ground, dragged across the floor and \u201ctwaking out.\u201d One man lay face down in a pool of his own blood and another was rolled out on a gurney.\n\nThe culprit, Whitney said, was K2, a synthetic cannabinoid also known as \u201ctwak;\u201d the Herald listed the drug as the most frequently confiscated contraband and the leading cause of overdose deaths.\n\nWhitney continued, \u201cYou know you might not wake up any day you smoke that.\u201d\n\nThe Florida Department of Corrections Office of Inspector General has opened an investigation into the video.\n\nThe agency wrote in an email to The Washington Post on Monday: \u201cThe Department uses every tool at their disposal to mitigate violence and contraband within our institutions. Correctional Officers are diligent in their efforts to search inmates and common areas to eradicate weapons and remove dangerous and illegal contraband. At the forefront of our priorities is an agencywide effort to recruit and retain correctional officers statewide.\u201d\n\n[Ohio finds numerous problems at troubled county jail]\n\nInmate-produced footage is extraordinarily rare, even more so when it\u2019s trafficked out of a prison, Ron McAndrew, a prison consultant and former warden, told the Herald.\n\nWhile gruesome and graphic photographs from inside prisons in Alabama and Mississippi were leaked and posted online this year, the first example of footage from a contraband phone making its way online, he said, was in July at another Florida facility. A prison captain and two guards were arrested and fired after a video of officers beating an inmate was uploaded to YouTube.\n\nUnder Florida law, contraband cellphones can result in new felony charges and add prison time to an inmate\u2019s sentence. Or, there\u2019s the threat of solitary confinement \u2014 a fate Whitney has experienced, the Herald reported.\n\nOn Sept. 19, Jordyn Gilley-Nixon, a prison reform advocate and former inmate, uploaded two minutes of Whitney\u2019s footage to YouTube. Since then, prison officials have housed Whitney in isolation. If he\u2019s released from solitary confinement, Whitney, whose drug-trafficking sentence ends in 2040, promised to continue filming.\n\nRead more:\n\nSuspect charged with murder in fatal beatings of 4 homeless people in NYC\n\nAs Trump calls for more \u2018institutions,\u2019 GOP lawmakers nationwide shift their focus to mental health\n\nWitness in ex-Dallas officer Amber Guyger\u2019s murder trial killed in shooting, lawyer says", "description": "A convicted drug trafficker spent years filming daily life inside one of Florida\u2019s notoriously dangerous prisons.
