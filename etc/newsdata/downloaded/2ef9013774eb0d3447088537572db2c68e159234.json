As Bentham used to say: Crack open this tasty lobster!\n\nBitcoin Price\n\nWe closed the day, October 24 2019, at a price of $7,493. That\u2019s a minor 0.21 percent decline in 24 hours, or -$16.23. It was the lowest closing price in one hundred and fifty-eight days.\n\nWe\u2019re still 62 percent below Bitcoin\u2018s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).\n\nBitcoin market cap\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market cap ended the day at $134,968,410,276. It now commands 66 percent of the total crypto market.\n\nBitcoin volume\n\nYesterday\u2019s volume of $16,268,708,849 was the lowest in two days, 5 percent above the year\u2019s average, and 63 percent below the year\u2019s high.\n\nBitcoin transactions\n\nA total of 303,710 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 9 percent below the year\u2019s average and 32 percent below the year\u2019s high.\n\nBitcoin transaction fee\n\nYesterday\u2019s average transaction fee concerned $0.28. That\u2019s $3.43 below the year\u2019s high of $3.71.\n\nBitcoin distribution by address\n\nAs of now, there are 11,485 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.\n\nFurthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 5.6 percent of the total supply, the top 100 14.5 percent, and the top 1000 34.5 percent.\n\nCompany with a market cap closest to Bitcoin\n\nWith a market capitalization of $137 billion, Total S.A. has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s path towards $1 million\n\nOn November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee predicted that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.\n\nHe even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn\u2019t. Unfortunately for him it\u2019s 93.9 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin\u2018s price should have been $122,958 by now, according to dickline.info.\n\nBitcoin Energy Consumption\n\nBitcoin used an estimated 200 million kilowatt hour of electricity yesterday. On a yearly basis that would amount to 73 terawatt hour. That\u2019s the equivalent of Austria\u2019s energy consumption or 6,8 million US households. Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption now represents 0.3% of the whole world\u2019s electricity use.\n\nBitcoin on Twitter\n\nYesterday 17,486 fresh tweets about Bitcoin were sent out into the world.
