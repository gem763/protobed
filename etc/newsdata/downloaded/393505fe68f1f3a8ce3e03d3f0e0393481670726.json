(AP) - Mississippi State\u2019s visit to Tennessee this week could feature a matchup of true freshman quarterbacks.\n\nTennessee quarterback Brian Maurer will make his second career start Saturday after delivering mixed results last week in a 43-14 loss to No. 3 Georgia. Mississippi State coach Joe Moorhead isn\u2019t saying whether he will start Penn State graduate transfer Tommy Stevens or freshman Garrett Shrader, who both have played quite a bit this season.\n\nMaurer threw for 209 yards and two touchdowns in the first half against Georgia before tailing off in the second half. He finished the game 14 of 28 for 259 yards and also had an interception and a fumble.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s way more positives than there were negatives,\u201d Tennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt said of Maurer\u2019s performance. \u201cHe\u2019s got to learn from them and not make the same mistakes again. But he did step in there and make some nice throws, and I thought our kids rallied around him pretty well.\u201d\n\nBoth Tennessee and Mississippi State could use a spark as they attempt to bounce back from lopsided losses. Mississippi State (3-2, 2-1 SEC) had last week off after losing 56-23 to No. 12 Auburn, which was ranked seventh at the time.\n\n\u201cYou can either dwell on it and allow the same game to try and beat you twice, or you can correct it, put it to bed and move on,\u201d Mississippi State coach Joe Moorhead said. \u201cWe chose the latter.\u201d\n\nWhile Mississippi State wants to put the Auburn game in the past, Tennessee is hoping its loss to Georgia represents a turning point. Although Tennessee ended up getting blown out, the Vols played well in the first half and led for most of the second quarter.\n\n\u201cI feel like we came out of our shell more,\u201d Tennessee safety Nigel Warrior said. \u201cI think more of the players, my teammates, we opened up a little bit. We played with more heart. That brought out more personality. If you looked on the sideline, you could see people jumping around. On the field, you could see more personality, screaming, talking to each other, communication.\u201d\n\nHere are some other things to know about Saturday\u2019s Mississippi State-Tennessee game.\n\nSTEVENS OR SHRADER?\n\nMoorhead isn\u2019t saying which of his quarterback will start Saturday\u2019s game, which means Tennessee has to prepare for both of them.\n\nShrader is the more mobile of the two quarterbacks. He\u2019s run for 312 yards and also has completed 58.8 percent of his passes for 511 yards with two touchdowns and an interception.\n\nStevens has completed 63.8 percent of his throws for 448 yards with five touchdowns and two interceptions.\n\nHILL ON THE RUN\n\nMississippi State has the SEC\u2019s leading rusher in Kylin Hill, who has run for 596 yards and five touchdowns while averaging 5.5 yards per carry. Hill has gained 344 yards after contact, also the most in the SEC.\n\nHandling Hill will be a challenge for a Tennessee defense that has given up 167.4 yards rushing per game. Kentucky and Vanderbilt are the only SEC teams yielding more yards rushing per game than Tennessee.\n\nSHOOP\u2019S RETURN\n\nThis game marks Mississippi State defensive coordinator Bob Shoop\u2019s return to Knoxville. Shoop was Tennessee\u2019s defensive coordinator in 2016-17 during the final two years of Butch Jones\u2019 coaching tenure. Shoop\u2019s son Jay Shoop is a walk-on defensive back for Tennessee.\n\nUNFAMILIAR FOES\n\nAlthough Tennessee and Mississippi State are both SEC members, this will mark the first time they\u2019ve faced each other since 2012. Mississippi State is visiting Knoxville for the first time since 2008.\n\nVOLS\u2019 RECEIVING THREATS\n\nMississippi State will have to watch out for Tennessee senior receivers Marquez Callaway and Jauan Jennings, who each caught a touchdown pass and accumulated over 100 yards receiving against Georgia. Jennings has five touchdown catches this season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mississippi State's visit to Tennessee this week could feature a matchup of true freshman quarterbacks.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Megargee"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/mississippi_st_auburn_football_24322_c0-157-3777-2360_s1200x700.jpg?8b5ffae3d2ab520948b4e6b440725b8fdb62aa45", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
