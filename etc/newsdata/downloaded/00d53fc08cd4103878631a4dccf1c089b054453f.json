In open democracies, voters rightly believe that, as a general rule, they should be able to judge what politicians say themselves.\u201d\n\nAnother social media giant, Twitter, announced in June they would be adding a warning label to public officials\u2019 tweets with a warning label if they violate their terms of service.\n\nThey said they will place \u201ca screen you have to click or tap through\u201d to see a Tweet from a politician that may violate their Terms of Service.\n\n\u201cThere are certain cases where it may be in the public\u2019s interest to have access to certain Tweets, even if they would otherwise be in violation of our rules,\u201d they said.\n\nPresident Trump has accused Facebook, Twitter and other social media companies of \u201ctrying to rig the election\u201d against him, claiming in June they \u201cmake it very hard for people to join me in Twitter, and they make it very much harder for me to get out the message.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
