With four days left in the regular season, the St. Louis Cardinals (90-69) lead Milwaukee (88-70) by 1.5 games. The Cardinals have three games left to play while the Brewers have four games remaining.\n\nWhichever team doesn\u2019t win the Central will face the Nationals in the NL Wild Card Game next Tuesday. The team with the better regular season will host the game \u2014 meaning if the season ended today, the Nationals (89-69) would have the edge over the Brewers.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all good news for the Nationals. They lose head-to-head tiebreakers against both the Brewers and Cardinals based on their regular season records against those teams. So if Washington ends up in a tie for the wild card lead with either team, they\u2019ll have to travel to Milwaukee or St. Louis for the do-or-die playoff contest.\n\nIn the event that St. Louis and Milwaukee finish with identical records, they would play a 163rd game Monday to determine the division champion.\n\nThe Nationals have four games remaining, all at home. On Thursday they go for the rare five-game sweep of the Philadelphia Phillies. Then they\u2019ll host the Cleveland Indians for three games to wrap up the regular season.\n\nNL Central (morning of Sept. 26):\n\n1. St. Louis: 90-69\n\n2. Milwaukee: 88-70\n\nNL Wild Card (morning of Sept. 26):\n\n1. Washington: 89-69\n\n2. Milwaukee: 88-70\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
