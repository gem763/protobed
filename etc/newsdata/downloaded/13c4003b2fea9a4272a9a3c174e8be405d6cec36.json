A time in which the public was subjected to a catalogue of lies. When our then prime minister, David Cameron, stated he would not resign if the country voted leave. He did.\n\nVote Leave were found guilty of overspending on their divisive campaigns, Ukip bred resentment toward migrants and the EU\u2019s laws, conflating migration with immigration to justify racism. As a result, the week following the referendum showed a huge spike in hate crimes.\n\nA couple of short years later, Boris Johnson, architect of the bogus \u00a3350 million funding promise for the NHS, is our prime minister, parliament has been prorogued, the speaker, John Bercow, is due to step down, and Cameron is back, only with the express interest of seeking to distance himself from the Brexiteer factions that sprung up as a result of the referendum, given the upcoming release of his memoir.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say things are murkier than ever. When you include the lack of competence by politicians as a whole, it\u2019s not surprising that people are becoming increasingly disillusioned by politics. I, myself, have felt nauseated by the sophism of UK politicians.\n\nFor three years and three months, Brexit has been a harrowing presence in our minds. I was an MA student at the time of the referendum, working two jobs and building my writing portfolio.\n\nBack then, I was interested enough to attend political panels. I remember one directed at youth and led by several panellists all subscribing to different parties. We offered unbiased discussion by analysing their manifestos from somewhat neutral positions. I argued for Labour and highlighted the importance of their potential policies on NHS, youth engagement and arts investment that could improve society. I felt confident enough in my understanding of politics to offer my views in a public arena. But things change.\n\nThose panels, while insightful, were somewhat pointless. The country was fixated on Brexit. I found myself politically alienated after another election that felt undemocratic. Two elections where the majority had not been won, but a coalition strung a Tory government. Since the last election, I have overseen the entirety of Brexit\u2019s process from a distance. Several months ago, the thought of politics incensed me. I felt depressed watching Theresa May handle the Grenfell situation. Dejected seeing the Windrush scandal unfold. Today, I\u2019m not surprised by the Home Office putting knife crime ads on chicken boxes. I have no faith in this government, the leaders and opposition, but I also see community in that alienation.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Some of my peers do not vote, many cannot summarise what Brexit is and how it will affect them and the country. And can you blame them? We\u2019re living in a time of stagnation, where we achieve no results, but through shorthand mediums of notifications, tweets, posts and the brief summary by word of mouth we all stay focused on the topics at hand.\n\nMost media channels are engrossed with click-bait headlines or misleading soundbites that focus on the hilarity of Johnsons\u2019 mannerisms or the lethargy of Jacob Rees-Mogg. These platforms are swamped with more announcements of ever-changing circumstances than most can count. From huge decisions like the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling over whether Johnson\u2019s prorogation of parliament was legal, to the potential breach of data privacy and ministerial code as a result of no-deal Brexit ad campaigns, Brexit feels more like grand summation of playground whispers than a serious political procedure.\n\nThe lies from politicians, collective stress of the general public, and never-ending discussions about Brexit makes me extremely tired of politics. But I soon realised I won\u2019t get answers by continuously watching the same thing.\n\nI decided to start investing in understanding politics again without solely relying on mainstream outlets for information. I started to use They Work For You after the last election, the that collects MPs voting history and comments on bills. I also subscribe to a number of online channels, such TL:DR News, a fantastic resource, and Our Future Our Choice\u2019s YouTube channel, particularly Femi Oluwole\u2019s videos. There are also platforms like The Independent\u2019s Politics Explained and the BBC\u2019s Global News Podcast. But our government should be trying harder to make politics accessible too. The public desperately needs information and help with finding it. With the phenomenon that is social media and ever-advancing technology, including algorithm-based advertisements, politics is increasingly being seen as a conflict of interest rather than a unified endeavour for a better life for all.\n\nBrexit has been a thorough example of what a campaign built on fake news can lead to. If we all weren\u2019t overwhelmed with stigma and lies and had a transparent non-combative approach to politics, perhaps this wouldn\u2019t all be so perplexing. Better yet, we probably wouldn\u2019t be leaving the EU in the first place.", "description": "As we await the likelihood of another general election, I\u2019ve been spending more and more time thinking about my strained relationship with politics in the years since the 2016 referendum.
