Bush", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cAvengers\u201d actor Mark Ruffalo on Wednesday scolded talk show host Ellen DeGeneres for dismissing people\u2019s criticism of her for sitting next to former President George W. Bush at a football game.\n\nAfter a photo went viral showing her and Mr. Bush sitting next to each other, Ms. DeGeneres attempted to quell the controversy during her Tuesday episode of \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d by telling people to \u201cbe kind to one another.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean only the people that think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone. Doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Ms. DeGeneres added. \u201cWe\u2019re all different, and I think that we\u2019ve forgotten that that\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nMr. Ruffalo, who played Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk in the \u201cAvengers\u201d movies, rebuked her statement by saying the president\u2019s action in the Iraq War were not warranting of \u201ckindness.\u201d\n\n\u201cUntil George W Bush is brought to justice for the crimes of the Iraq War (including American-lead torture, Iraqi deaths and displacement, and the deep scars \u2014 emotional and otherwise \u2014 inflicted on our military that served his folly), we can\u2019t even begin to talk about kindness,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nActress Susan Sarandon also criticized Ms. DeGeneres, saying she\u2019s \u201cmissing the point entirely.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeGeneres framed the issue as simply a matter of her hanging out with someone with different opinions, not a man repeatedly accused of being a war criminal,\u201d she said.\n\nA few actresses came to Ms. DeGeneres\u2018 side. Kristen Bell posted a picture of Mr. Bush and Ms. DeGeneres side by side with the caption \u201cShe\u2019s my [queen],\u201d while Reese Witherspoon said the statement was an \u201cimportant reminder.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have friends who don\u2019t think the same things that i do. When I say be kind to one another , I don\u2019t mean be kind to the people who think the same way you do . I mean ..Be Kind to Everyone.,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said in a tweet, which has since been deleted after receiving backlash.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
