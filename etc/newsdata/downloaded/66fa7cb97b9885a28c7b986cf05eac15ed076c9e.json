Photo: Tasto Katopodis/Getty Images\n\nWhen Donald Trump announced Sunday morning that U.S. Special Operations forces had killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, he reveled in the last moments of the \u201cworld\u2019s number one terrorist leader.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe died like a dog, he died like a coward, he was whimpering, screaming and crying,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd frankly, I think it\u2019s something that should be brought out.\u201d\n\nBut two days after the announcement, it\u2019s still unclear where Trump\u2019s information on al-Baghdadi\u2019s last moments came from. The Pentagon has been unable to confirm that al-Baghdadi was \u201cwhimpering, screaming and crying,\u201d and the Daily Beast reports that senior administration officials have \u201cno clue\u201d where Trump got his information.\n\nFive senior Trump administration officials who watched in real time as the president spoke on Sunday morning each told The Daily Beast that they had no idea where the president got the \u201cwhimpering and crying and screaming\u201d detail. Two officials recounted how after they heard that on Sunday, they immediately began messaging each other questions and comments like, \u201cuh where is he getting that?\u201d\n\nTrump himself wouldn\u2019t say how he knew about al-Baghdadi\u2019s tears Sunday. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d he said when a reporter asked if he could hear the sounds on his video feed. We now know the answer to that question. Trump couldn\u2019t have heard al-Baghdadi because the live stream he watched from the Situation Room Saturday did not include audio.\n\nGeneral Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters Monday that he didn\u2019t have any knowledge of the alleged crying and Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said the same. Both men gave Trump an out though, suggesting that the president may have spoken to the troops who carried out the mission and gotten the information from them.\n\n\u201cI know the president had planned to talk down to the unit and unit members,\u201d Milley said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what the source of that was. I assume it was talking directly to unit and unit members.\u201d\n\nSo, did Trump talk to the Special Forces members who carried out the raid against al-Baghdadi and learn that he was bawling like a baby? When the Times asked White House officials Monday, they wouldn\u2019t say.", "description": "Trump said ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi  was crying and whimpering in his last moments, but it\u2019s not clear where that information came from.", "authors": ["Adam K.
