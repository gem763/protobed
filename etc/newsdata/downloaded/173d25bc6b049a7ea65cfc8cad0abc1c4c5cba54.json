REUTERS/Luisa Gonzalez\n\nDuque, who accuses Maduro of providing a safe haven for Colombian rebel fighters from the now-demobilized FARC guerrilla group and the still-active ELN rebels, compared the Venezuelan leader to former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who was put on trial for alleged war crimes in conflicts that destabilized the Balkans.\n\n\u201cWe should look at communal sanctions and actions so that the threat of (Venezuela) protecting terrorism in its territory ends,\u201d Duque told Reuters before traveling to the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York.\n\n\u201cThe international community must understand that the dictatorship has to come to an end soon because the humanitarian tragedy, in addition to the consolidation of a dictatorial regime that is coexisting with drug cartels and with terrorism, is a threat for the whole Western hemisphere and for the stability of the world.\u201d\n\nMaduro accuses Colombia of preparing to attack Venezuela, and has repeatedly warned of an invasion coordinated with the U.S. government.\n\nLatin American countries could invoke the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, known by its Spanish initials TIAR, against Maduro, Duque said. The treaty considers an attack on any of the signatories to be an attack on them all.\n\n\u201cThe TIAR has been invoked many times and many times with success, but the invocation of it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to refer in an explicit way to military actions,\u201d Duque said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important first is coordinated action.\u201d\n\nWashington, which has levied several rounds of sanctions against Maduro\u2019s government, has expressed hope that European nations will also impose sanctions in the coming months.\n\nMost western nations consider Maduro illegitimate - saying he secured a second term last year via a fraudulent vote. Colombia is among the countries which back opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader.\n\nMaduro says Guaido is a U.S. puppet seeking a coup.\n\nColombia stands ready to confront any attack by former members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)rebels, a group of whom recently rearmed, Duque said.\n\n\u201cWhen they decide to enter Colombian territory we\u2019ll be here waiting with all of the strength of the armed forces,\u201d Duque said. \u201cYou can never minimize an effort to defeat terrorism.\u201d\n\nColombia has lately come under pressure from the Trump administration to reduce the cultivation of coca, the base ingredient in cocaine, which hit record levels in recent years.\n\nBut Duque said the fight to eradicate half of the more than 200,000 hectares of the plant by 2023 is his country\u2019s own.\n\n\u201cThe fight against drug trafficking is a fight of conviction, of principles, we don\u2019t do it because of pressure from anyone,\u201d he said.", "description": "Colombian President Ivan Duque called on Saturday for coordinated international sanctions targeting Venezuela to help stop President Nicolas Maduro's support for Colombian rebels and drug traffickers from destabilizing Latin America.", "authors": ["Julia Symmes Cobb", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432469652&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L007", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
