People are estimated to search for \u201cCBD\u201d and \u201ccannabidiol\u201d 117.7% more this year, compared to last year, the researchers added.\n\nConsumers looked up the two terms 6.4 million times in April, the last month researchers collected data. CBD was the fourth-most searched health-related topic that month, the study said. Diet was the most-searched health topic on Google GOOG, +0.88% that month while e-cigarettes were second and yoga was third.\n\nThe study noted CBD is \u201cwidely promoted as a panacea\u201d even though research on its effects and benefits is still very slim.\n\n\u201cCBD has become insanely popular,\u201d said Dr. John W. Ayers, the study\u2019s co-author and vice chief of innovation at the University of California, San Diego\u2019s Division of Infectious Disease and Global Public Health \u201cThree years ago, there was essentially no one searching about CBD online, but now there are an estimated 6.4 million unique searches each month.\u201d\n\nThe upward search trend comes at a time when consumers can buy all sorts of products that include the compound, including CBD-infused oil, jelly beans, bath salts, skin lotion and pet products. It\u2019s even available at your local SoulCycle and other gyms. The retail CBD sales could pass $1 billion this year and get past $10 billion in 2024, according to Hemp Industry Daily, a trade publication covering the market.\n\nConsumers may be buying CBD products, but many are uncertain about them. In fact, a separate study this week found 48% of 2,440 polled participants used CBD but were concerned about its safety.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: People of color are reclaiming their place in a cannabis industry \u2018built on the backs of people from marginalized communities\u2019\n\n\u201cEven as this industry has matured, the lack of regulations and accountability is still worrisome,\u201d said Darcie Moran, quality assurance director at Joy Organics, the Fort Collins, Colo.-based CBD products company that commissioned the survey. \u201cMany consumers simply don\u2019t know what they\u2019re putting in their body or which brands to trust.\u201d\n\nHere are some of the basic answers on CBD that consumers should consider.\n\nWhat is CBD\u2019s legal status?\n\nThe 2018 federal Farm Bill legalized hemp, the cannabis plant that can produce CBD. The compound is an active ingredient in one Food and Drug Administration-approved drug to treat epilepsy. And because it is an active ingredient in an FDA-regulated drug, companies cannot put it in food and drinks sold over state lines, or as a dietary supplement. Cosmetics, on the other hand, don\u2019t require premarket FDA approval.\n\nMeanwhile, 47 states allow some form of consumer access to CBD. Some state laws, however, are \u201cextremely limited,\u201d according to Paul Armentano, deputy director of NORML, an advocacy organization supporting full marijuana legalization.\n\nIs CBD addictive?\n\nThe research so far points to \u2018no.\u2019 Dr. Elaine Wyllie, who treats epilepsy at the Cleveland Clinic, said researchers \u201cbelieve that CBD treatment is likely to involve a low risk of abuse or addiction.\u201d\n\nLikewise, the World Health Organization\u2019s Expert Committee on Drug Dependence said in 2017 that CBD, \u201cin its pure state\u2026does not appear to have abuse potential or cause harm.\u201d\n\nWhat CBD can and can\u2019t do\n\nThe only FDA-approved drug using CBD treats epilepsy, but that hasn\u2019t stopped some companies from suggesting the compound can be used to treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease, cancer, autism, Parkinson\u2019s disease and other conditions.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic said studies are looking into CBD\u2019s use for conditions including Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis and anxiety, but \u201cresearch supporting the drug\u2019s benefits is still limited.\u201d\n\nThe FDA and Federal Trade Commission sent warning letters this week to one company appearing to make unsubstantiated claims in its advertising. The company suggested its products could help customers with autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease, according to regulators. \u201cUnder the FTC Act, it is unlawful to advertise that a product can prevent, treat, or cure human disease unless the seller has competent and reliable scientific evidence substantiating that the claims are true when made,\u201d the agencies said in their letter.\n\n\u201cThere are many unanswered questions about the science, safety, effectiveness and quality of unapproved products containing CBD,\u201d the two agencies said. Earlier this year, the two agencies sent similar warning letters to three companies talking about the supposed many therapeutic benefits of CBD.\n\nCBD is sometimes marketed to aid anxiety and insomnia. Nevertheless, researchers point out there\u2019s been very few scientific studies on humans using CBD. For example, Dr. Peter Grinspoon, who teaches at Harvard Medical School, noted one study using animals showed CBD lowered arthritis\u2019 pain and inflammation. \u201cMore study in humans is needed in this area to substantiate the claims of CBD proponents about pain control,\u201d Grinspoon said.", "description": "CBD is among the top health-related searches, along with \u2018diet,\u2019 \u2018e-cigarettes,\u2019 and \u2018yoga,\u2019 researchers found.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT830_cbd_pr_ZG_20191023092107.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
