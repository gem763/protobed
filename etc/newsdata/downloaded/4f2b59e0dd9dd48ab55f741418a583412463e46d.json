I remember going on air, I believe at Fox, saying this man shouldn\u2019t have a platform anywhere let alone be working for any candidate. So, years ago, he\u2019s an absolute clown show, and also don\u2019t forget\u2014excuse me, and I\u2019m so upset by this\u2014that he mocked an immigrant child with Down syndrome. Remember that?\u201d\n\nThe conservative host was referencing a Lewandowski appearance on Fox News last year when the Trump associate dismissively brushed off the story of a 10-year-old migrant child with Down syndrome being removed from her mother at the border, infamously saying: \u201cWomp womp!\u201d\n\nMoments later, the table also took issue with Lewandowski saying he has \u201cno obligation to be honest to the media,\u201d noting that he once worked as a contributor for CNN during the 2016 election.\n\nHours before the View aired, meanwhile, Lewandowski was invited on air by CNN for a predictably contentious and frustrating interview despite his confession that he doesn\u2019t feel it\u2019s necessary to tell the truth to the media.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
