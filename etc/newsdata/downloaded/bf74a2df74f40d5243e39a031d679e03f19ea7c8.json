As one reporter covering the hoopla-that-wasn\u2019t guessed to this writer, \u201cI don\u2019t think people really know this [fashion line] exists.\u201d\n\nIt appeared that the few dozen people standing in line outside of the Bowery Hotel for the LBV Care of Joss Sackler show also did not know the dogged family\u2019s controversy exists. \u201cWhat scandal?\u201d one man asked wide-eyed when asked why he chose to support Sackler. \u201cDoes that mean I should leave?\u201d (He did not.)\n\n\u201cI am totally unaware,\u201d Sydney Posnock, a blogger, said. \u201cI\u2019m not very familiar with [the brand]. They called me and this my first Fashion Week, so I want to go to all the shows that I can go to. I\u2019m excited to view the brand\u2019s collection.\u201d\n\nJuan Delgado, who was invited through family connections but said he has never met Sackler, hadn\u2019t heard stories about the line, but as a vegan felt against the designer\u2019s use of \u201cexotic skins.\u201d Still, he felt that speaking out against LBV would be too hasty.\n\n\u201cThe easiest way for us to confront someone who has a different opinion is to shut down and hate, but I don\u2019t think that is the answer,\u201d Delgado said. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone is doing right now\u2014\u2018I hate you because you\u2019re a Trump supporter.\u2019 Humans should communicate more to understand each other.\u201d\n\nJaya Karamores\u2019 husband works out with Sackler at Dogpound, a trendy South Village gym that counts Victoria\u2019s Secret Angels as clients. She was \u201canticipating\u201d protests, but decided to come to support her friend anyway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfair,\u201d Karamores said. \u201cShe\u2019s her own women and people should see the line before they open their mouths. All she\u2019s seen as is a man\u2019s wife. For her to run a business is amazing.\u201d\n\n\u201c You should be able to subtract yourself from your family and be your own person, otherwise we would all be ghosts of our family\u2019s past \u201d\n\nKaramores is an LBV fan, but wasn\u2019t wearing the collection on Monday. \u201cI wish I could afford to,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of Sackler\u2019s friends made up the audience\u2014but more than a few did not want to speak with The Daily Beast. \u201cI have no comment,\u201d said one woman in a black and gold kaftan, in between pulls from an oversized vape.\n\nStephanie Unter, a freelance fashion writer and stylist, was also happy to come out. \u201cYou should be able to subtract yourself from your family and be your own person, otherwise we would all be ghosts of our family\u2019s past,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I feel, no matter who it is. If you have parents who are jailed or are killers and you do something that's for your own good, you should be free to do that.\u201d", "description": "Despite the controversy around it, OxyContin heiress Joss Sackler presented her NYFW collection protest-free.
