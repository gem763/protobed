ITV also had an unsuccessful bid to retain the highlights package they used to air on Wednesday evenings.\n\nThe Times also reports the tender document includes rights for the Europa League, and the new third-tier tournament, the Europa Conference League. The winner of next season's Carabao Cup will be England's representative in the new competition.", "description": "BT Sport's exclusive rights to air the Champions League may be coming to an end from 2021, as ITV and Sky are set to mount a bid, according to The Times.", "authors": ["Matt Porter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/18/19502492-0-image-a-29_1570641856388.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
