The protests brought them arrest and harassment.\n\nWhen the decree lifting the ban was announced by Saudi ambassador to Washington, Prince Khaled bin Salman, who said women would not need permission from their guardians to get a license or have a guardian in the car and would be allowed to drive anywhere in the kingdom, including the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina.\n\nHowever women still face a bumpy road in the kingdom, with approval from male guardians needed in the fields of education, employment, marriage, travel plans and medical treatment.", "description": "Women at Jeddah's Effat University took their first driving lessons on Wednesday, March 7, ahead of the lifting of a ban on women driving in Saudi Arabia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/09/68/10/1000x563_f28037e5-52f3-56c0-ab15-3bd57d601f7a-3096810.jpg", "published_at": "2018-03-08"}
