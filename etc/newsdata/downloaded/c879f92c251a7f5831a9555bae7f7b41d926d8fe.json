The Massachusetts senator has accused Wall Street of \u201clooting the economy\u201d and vowed to \u201crein in the financial industry\u201d if elected.\n\nDuring a panel discussion on CNBC, outspoken US television personality Jim Cramer said executives were \u201cfearful of her winning\u201d.\n\nMr Cramer, a former hedge fund manager who presents the network\u2019s Mad Money, said Ms Warren was a \u201cvery compelling figure on the stump\u201d and predicted she would win Iowa\u2019s caucuses in February \u2013 the first major test of her presidential campaign. He claimed he had heard some Wall Street bankers say \u201cshe\u2019s got to be stopped\u201d.\n\nFellow CNBC panellist David Faber said he had heard similar concerns in the US financial district.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another reason why companies are being implored to do things now,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause come early-to-mid-2020, if Elizabeth Warren\u2019s rolling along, everybody is going to be like, \u2018That\u2019s it.\u2019\u201d\n\nPhilip Klinkner, a political scientist and professor at New York\u2019s Hamilton College, said: \u201cThis tracks with my conversations with Wall Street types.\u201d\n\nHe said Ms Warren\u2019s Democratic opponent Bernie Sanders, who has proposed taxing Wall Street to pay off student debt, was \u201cseen as a more of a crank but ultimately non-threatening\u201d.\n\nMr Klinkner added: \u201cOn the other hand, they really, really, really hate Elizabeth Warren. They know that she\u2019s on to them and that she can make life hell for them through the regulatory process.\u201d\n\nLynnette Khalfani-Cox, a personal finance expert and former Wall Street reporter, said many banking executives were \u201cindeed shaking in their boots over a Warren presidency\u201d.\n\nShe suggested they were fearful that Ms Warren would \u201chold all financial organisations accountable\u201d, protect consumers and \u201ctax ultra millionaires\u201d.\n\nSome commentators on social media suggested Wall Street\u2019s apparent opposition to the Democrat would stand in her favour. \u201cThis is the greatest Warren campaign ad possible,\u201d tweeted left-wing activist Adam Best.\n\nI'm Elizabeth Warren and I approve this message. https://t.co/2Ewkbm0ZwA \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 10, 2019\n\nMs Warren herself responded to a clip of the CNBC discussion that was posted on Twitter by tweeting: \u201cI\u2019m Elizabeth Warren and I approve this message.\u201d\n\nBut some bankers have previously indicated they would prefer the senator to Mr Sanders, who is seen as her key challenger for the liberal vote.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s preferable for many reasons,\u201d Robert Wolf, a venture investor and former adviser to Barack Obama, told Politico in July. \u201cShe\u2019s been very clear that she believes in fair capitalism.
