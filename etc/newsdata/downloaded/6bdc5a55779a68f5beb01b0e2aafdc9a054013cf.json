(Oct. 7) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Kirstjen Nielsen, President Donald Trump's former Department of Homeland Security secretary, said Tuesday she left her post after \u201cit became clear that saying no and refusing it to do it myself was not going to be enough\" regarding some policies.\n\nBut when pressed on whether she regretted signing the memo that resulted in family separations, Nielsen said, \"I don't regret enforcing the law because I took an oath to do that, as did everybody at the Department of Homeland Security.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I regret is that that information flow and coordination to quickly reunite the families was clearly not in place,\u201d she stated during an interview at Fortune\u2019s Most Powerful Women Summit. She added that it\u2019s the reason why \u201cthe practice was stopped through an executive order.\u201d\n\nNielsen, 47, implemented the Trump administration's controversial family separation policy after being appointed DHS secretary in December 2017 that led to the separation of thousands of families along the Southern border. She resigned in April of this year.\n\nWATCH: \"I don't regret enforcing the law,\" former DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tells @IAmAmnaNawaz when asked whether she regrets the administration's family separation policy.\n\n\n\nMore: https://t.co/jL6A5BUWhxpic.twitter.com/RlfcGWarju \u2014 PBS NewsHour (@NewsHour) October 22, 2019\n\nDespite the 2018 executive order, family separations at the border have reportedly continued.\n\nMore: Trump administration has separated hundreds of children from their migrant families since 2018\n\nNielsen\u2019s appearance at the summit sparked contention, and led to some participants dropping out, including singer Brandi Carlile. Carlile tweeted, \"I don\u2019t think that human rights violators and merit-based abusers of displaced people should be given a platform to 'reimagine' history. Ever.\" She described the practice of separating immigrant families as \"one of the United States of America\u2019s most merciless acts.\"\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also dropped out of the summit last week, citing a scheduling conflict. However, Slate reported the decision was made after learning Nielsen would be participating.\n\nEarlier this month, President Trump announced that acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan was leaving the administration after six months on the job. McAleenan replaced Nielsen in April.\n\nWhen questioned if anyone raised concerns that children would be traumatized as a consequence of the policy, Nielsen stated, \"not from staff, no.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/22/kirstjen-nielsen-former-dhs-secretary-said-she-left-post-because-saying-no-wasnt-enough/2450196001/", "description": "When asked\u00a0on whether she regretted signing the memo that resulted in\u00a0family separations, Nielsen\u00a0said, \"I don't regret enforcing the law because I took an oath to do that...\"", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Published P.M.
