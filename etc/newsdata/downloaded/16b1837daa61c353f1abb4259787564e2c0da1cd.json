Farm pigs are typically around 275lb.\n\nThe pigs being bred in Guangxi sell for up to \u00a31,135, more than three times the average monthly disposable income in the region\u2019s capital, Nanning, according to Bloomberg News.\n\nMore than 4,000 sausages or rashers of bacon could be produced from Mr Pang\u2019s giant pig.\n\nChina produces around half of the world\u2019s pigs and pork accounts for more than 60% of Chinese families\u2019 meat consumption.\n\n(Image: Rex)\n\nPig stocks have dropped nearly 40% in a year after more than a million pigs were killed by African swine fever.\n\nA manager at one of China\u2019s top pig farms reportedly said: \u201cFor us, the cost of raising pigs is about 10 yuan (\u00a31.10) per kilo, while the pork prices are at 30 (\u00a33.30) in some places.\n\n\u201cEvery kilo more meat you get means double profits. Everyone wants to raise fatter pigs.\u201d\n\nPeter Stevenson added: \u201cWe know when broiler chickens are bred to very fast and big like this that it creates a build-up of fluid in the abdomen because their heart cannot support their body size.\n\n\u201cThis is also likely to lead to respiratory problems, with the pigs\u2019 hips and legs likely to suffer problems from supporting that amount of weight. If it happened here, it would be likely to contravene animal cruelty laws.\u201d", "description": "One farmer in China, Pang Cong, told how his biggest pig could provide an incredible 4,000 sausages or rashers of bacon alone and sell for up to \u00a31,135", "authors": ["Martin Bagot", "Image", "Getty Images", "Reuters", "Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20540105.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Mexico-Retaliates-Against-US-Imposed-Tariffs-Outlining-Tariffs-Of-Their-Own-On-US-Products.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
