And even though these posts violate Facebook\u2019s stated terms of service, they\u2019re still up, Facebook is still paid for them, and the people who are targeted to receive them still believe them.\u201d\n\nClinton also complained that democracy was being threatened by \u201cphony, false, online news stories\u201d that \u201cmigrate to the so-called mainstream media.\u201d\n\nShe attacked Facebook for suggesting that users ought to \u201cdecide for themselves\u201d whether to believe or disbelieve content on the platform.\n\nAre you an insider at Google, Facebook, Twitter or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?
