The challenge here is that you have to rely on selling your transferable skills in a market where you are competing with those who are potentially more qualified for the role than you are.\n\nNot that we\u2019re saying it can\u2019t be done \u2013 just that you will need to really up your game if you want to be noticed.\n\nBefore you even begin with your search, some preparation will go a long way into making your search easier.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to invest some time in not only making a list of the skills you can bring (along with examples of how you used those specific skills), but you\u2019ll also want to ensure that your CV has been tailored to the needs of the industry you\u2019d like to work in.\n\nREAD MORE: How to use the skills you have to make a career switch\n\nOnce you have done your research about the industry and ensured that your CV reflects not only your set of skills but showcases your adaptability, you need to find innovative ways to not only market yourself but to maximise on any opportunity that presents itself along the way.\n\nMake them interested in you \u2013 build a brand for yourself\n\nAccording to Erin Greenawald from The Muse.com, many people underestimate how important it is to create an online presence\n\nthat not only highlights what you\u2019re offering but also focuses on what you want to be doing.\n\nSocial media has become one of the essential tools for both recruiters and job hunters \u2013 so take advantage and create a website or landing page that speaks for you.\n\nOn doing a quick search amongst those I am following on Twitter, I\u2019ve picked up on the fact that many freelancers have been making use of one-page portfolios or about me pages that effectively sums up the services they\u2019re offering.\n\nGreenawald adds that in developing your personal online site, you should think of yourself as a product and avoid going with a common approach that merely lists your achievements because many people can do the job that you do.\n\nPosition yourself as a brand and package what you\u2019re offering in a way that confidently shows how you accomplish what you do with tangible examples.

The key is to keep educating yourself even while you\u2019re in the process of looking for a job.\n\nEnrol in a course that will help you with a skill you\u2019re lacking\n\nIn addition to selling the skills you have, looking into ways to bridge the knowledge gap about the sector you\u2019re interested in can go a long way in showing your potential and future employers that you\u2019re committed to learning all that you can about the industry.\n\nAccording to Northeastern.edu, enrolling in courses related to the job you\u2019d like also gives you the chance to gain the experience of the type of work you\u2019d need to be doing and deciding whether or not it is actually something you\u2019d want to do.\n\nThe best part is that many online courses are actually free, so you don't necessarily have to spend money until you're sure you really want to invest in your career change, in which case you can then opt for more advanced courses.\n\nLike any change or transition, making a career change comes with its fair set of obstacles and challenges. But, if you\u2019ve been sitting in a position for years and have experienced no career or personal growth, with a little bit of effort and a lot of hard work, a new path could be just the kind of energy you need to inject into your career trajectory.\n\nWriter | Tammy February", "description": "Looking for a new position is no walk in the park, but how do you navigate the job searching territory when you want to make a career change?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7122/5425e695a0e74f97bb6ada0e88376bee.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
