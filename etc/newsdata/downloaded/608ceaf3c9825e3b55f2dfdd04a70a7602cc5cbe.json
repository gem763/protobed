The designer hosted his spring 2020 runway show at the Park Avenue Armory in NYC; he sent out an army of models wearing everything from prairie dresses to creations that echoed those of Tomo Koizumi. Nailing down a single theme in Jacob's collection would be difficult, since he appeared to design whatever his heart desired (e.g. one of his looks, a long jersey dress with a lace back, referenced a famous Jeanloup Sieff photo of YSL muse Marina Schiano, who passed away this week). Check out Jacobs' runway looks, ahead.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6eCUWpcXPm.TpGjMqV1MuA--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/marie_claire_447/16bae535c980c20d6dda2a54ad580592", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
