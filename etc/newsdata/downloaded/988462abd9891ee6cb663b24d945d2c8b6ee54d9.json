Trump abruptly announced a week ago that he was pulling U.S. forces out of northern Syria, and within days, Turkey had launched an offensive into the region.\n\nCritics have accused Trump of paving the way for Turkey\u2019s military intervention and have accused the administration of abandoning the Kurds, a key ally in the years-long fight against the Islamic State (ISIS) in the region.\n\n\u201cThe United States of America did not give a green light to Turkey to invade Syria,\u201d Pence said outside the White House, rebutting the assessment of lawmakers and former military officials. \u201cThe president has been very clear on that point and reiterated that to President Erdogan today.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump announced that he would impose sanctions on Turkey over the country\u2019s military incursion in northern Syria. The sanctions target government officials in Ankara. Trump is also increasing steel tariffs on Turkey from 25 percent to 50 percent and halting trade negotiations with Ankara.\n\n\u201cTurkey\u2019s military offensive is endangering civilians and threatening peace, security, and stability in the region,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cI have been perfectly clear with President Erdogan: Turkey\u2019s action is precipitating a humanitarian crisis and setting conditions for possible war crimes.\u201d\n\nThe move may assuage some of Trump\u2019s critics on Capitol Hill, among them many Republicans.\n\nTrump has vociferously defended his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria over the past week, reiterating his pledge to stop U.S. engagement in \u201cendless wars.\u201d Trump has also downplayed the importance of the U.S.-Kurdish alliance, saying the Kurds aligned with the U.S. on the anti-ISIS campaign only because of their own territorial interests and suggesting Russia, China or Syrian President Bashar Assad could protect them moving forward.", "description": "President Trump on Monday called on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan to negotiate a ceasefire with Kurdish forces amid violence in the region precipitated by a U.S. withdrawal from northern Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/syria_turkish_soldier_2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
