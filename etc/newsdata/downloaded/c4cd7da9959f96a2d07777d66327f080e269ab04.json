His broadcasting skills and genuine heart come across in both arenas. The journalist has delved into the deep devotion of fatherhood in his feature stories on Dragon Dads and a week-long \u201cToday\u201d series called \u201cDads Got This.\u201d It showcases fathers supporting daughters, in every regard, from learning how to braid hair to building microphone stands for dance rehearsals.\n\nOn the job or at home, Craig Melvin is all in as a dad, as any glance at his social media will show.\n\nCraig Melvin is a very involved and proud parent by all accounts to his five-year-old son, Delano, and three-year-old daughter, Sybil, who goes by \u201cSibby.\u201d Melvin and his wife, Lindsay Czarniak, frequently share glimpses of milestones and family downtime in photos. The recognition of the International Day of the Girl on \u201cToday\u201d this morning, October 11, fit right into the fatherhood character of Craig Melvin, and the salute to niceness, culminating in the naming of Columbiana, Ohio as the Reader's Digest \u201cNicest Place in America,\u201d was just fine, too.\n\nHe took no issue in Martina McBride championing the female presence in country music or the performance by Alessia Cara. There was a little something else.\n\nA neighborhood tradition of sneaking candy onto his doorstep, however, seemed to rub the newsman the wrong way.\n\nNot so fun to Melvin\n\nNo viewer ever knows where the opening few minutes of banter on the third hour of \u201cToday\u201d will go, and this morning, with Halloween drawing ever nearer, the topic of candy and kids had to come up.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news! Click on the topic you interest most. We'll keep you updated with all the news you shouldn't miss. TV Shows\n\nAl Roker openly confessed to a \u201cman-crush\u201d on Craig Melvin last week but thought his colleague was a little tough on some kids recently who snuck by the front door to leave some sweet treats.\n\nMuch love to my guy @alroker for his kindness & generosity. \ud83d\udc99\n\n\n\nThanks @Variety for putting me on your power list. Honored & humbled. https://t.co/LYJ5QFTSJm \u2014 Craig Melvin (@craigmelvin) October 1, 2019\n\n\u201cYou never know about the mean streets of Westport,\u201d poked the jovial weatherman.\n\nMelvin admitted he was very wary of the activity late at night by his door, and captured a snippet on his camera. He considered calling the authorities but thought better of it after viewing the evidence.\n\nCarson Daly piped in, being very familiar with this custom of \u201cghosting\u201d candy. The idea is to leave the candy, and sometimes a note, and the recipient can \u201cpay forward\u201d this week's gesture to another neighbor.\n\nDaly, also a dad to soon-to-be four children, displayed that he had several images of notes and the young goblins. Dylan Dreyer recalled the days of eggs and toilet paper being left in lawns, so being the victim of a candy deposit doesn't seem so bad at all.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the long hours\n\nSleep deprivation might be the reason why the smooth and affable Melvin is a little more jumpy than usual at the moment.\n\nThe correspondents at MSNBC are running on coffee to keep up with the never-ending breaking news of the impeachment proceedings, with shoes dropping by the minute. Every co-host on \u201cToday\u201d must report for duty at 3:15 AM, even if he or she has two anchor desks.\n\nCandy can be great for a brief sugar high to take Craig Melvin through his \u201cToday\u201d and MSNBC shifts, and maybe he can catch a nap and listen to a little Hootie & the Blowfish.", "description": "On a morning extolling girl power and niceness, the co-host and dad draws the line him at leaving candy on his doorstep.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Oliver Vandervoort", "Asmir Pekmic", "Read More On The Same Topic Tresa Patterson", "Hawaii Five-O", "Season Episode", "Cullen'S Surprise Croissants", "A Plane Crash Perp", "Erin Krakow Keeps", "When Calls The Heart S"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/11/os/b_1200x630/craig-melvin-loves-being-a-dad-here-with-sibby-but-be-careful-coming-to-the-today-co-hosts-doorstep-image-sourcetoday-youtube_2337863.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
