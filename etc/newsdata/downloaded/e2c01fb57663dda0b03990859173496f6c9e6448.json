But don\u2019t dismiss these Nats.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cWhat a tough break. We all feel terrible [for Scherzer],\u201d said the matriarch of the Lerner family, often affectionately called the brains of the outfit by her large family. Then she paused.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou got to have heart. Miles and miles and miles of heart,\u201d she quoted from the Broadway musical \u201cDamn Yankees.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to need it tonight.\u201d\n\nJust a few minutes later, Scherzer, walking gingerly and stiffly, barely able to move his neck, came to the media room to discuss the shocking development.\n\nNever, not in a lifetime, have you seen the player many call Mad Max so suddenly and forlornly transformed into Sad Max.\n\n\u201cStarted a couple of days ago . . . I\u2019ve had little neck spasms [in] the past. I know how to get through them. . . . Little adjustments keep it from blowing up on me,\u201d said Scherzer, who once had to come out of a game after one inning in Miami and once went on the disabled list \u2014 the only time in his career to that point \u2014 after similar spasms drove him off the mound. \u201cCame in [Saturday] \u2026 thought we found a way to ease this spasm. . . . I was able to play catch. . . .\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThen when I woke up this morning I was completely locked up. The nerve that\u2019s in the neck is all jammed up. . . . It became impossible just to do any menial task whatsoever today,\u201d he said, disgusted.\n\nThen Scherzer flared, jaw tight. \u201cI\u2019ve pitched through so much crap in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m as disappointed as I possibly can be not to be [starting]. It\u2019s Game 5 of the World Series.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he thought that the irregularity of postseason starts or being used for one inning of relief 23 days ago could be related, Scherzer said: \u201cAbsolutely not. This is just a little thing that turned into a big thing that turned into a giant thing. . . .\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been other little times where I\u2019ve been able to have it and get out of it. But this is the most severe one of all time.\u201d\n\nAnd at the worst possible time. The work ethic \u2014 or borderline-insanity \u2014 of pro athletes is illustrated by Scherzer\u2019s reaction to being unable to lift his arm. Since he has been told a cortisone shot takes 48 hours to be effective, Scherzer decided against one Saturday and crossed his fingers. On Sunday, a few hours before his team lost Game 5, 7-1, the shot was the only choice.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just hoping that the doctors are right and that something could be possible for Game 7,\u201d Scherzer said. Game 7, if the series goes that far, would be Wednesday night in Houston.\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this season, Scherzer pitched and shut down the Phillies with a whopper of a black eye and a broken nose \u2014 self-inflicted \u2014 from a fouled bunt during batting practice the previous day.\n\nIt would show a poor grasp of baseball history to dismiss the Nationals\u2019 chances of winning this series. Two years ago, with the Nats facing elimination, Stephen Strasburg shut down the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, fanning a dozen in seven innings, to force a Game 5. Strasburg carved through a fearsome Cubs lineup with such precision that, later, Chicago star Anthony Rizzo acknowledged his team had no chance.\n\nStrasburg will start Game 6 of this World Series, has been brilliant for his past dozen starts and, with Justin Verlander as a foe or not, may well force a Game 7.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn all sports, a Game 7 exists in a world of its own \u2014 an unpredictable subspecies that breeds unexpected heroes. A matchup of Zack Greinke vs. An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez, at least for the first few innings, could go in any direction. The Nats would have Patrick Corbin, on three days\u2019 rest, in the bullpen. And maybe a very Mad Max, too.\n\nA half-hour before the game, Ross was given a standing ovation by a nearly packed Nationals Park as he walked slowly and alone from the dugout to the outfield to begin his stretching. Sometimes the coolest moments are unscripted and exist independent of what happens next. If a crowd can lift an athlete, this one would try.\n\nWhen Ross got Jos\u00e9 Altuve to ground into double play for the first outs of the game, the crowd of 43,910 erupted like it was the final out. The crowds stood and chanted \u201cLet\u2019s go, Joe\u201d for the whole inning. Regardless of final score, those moments will be hard to forget.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, the World Series is not a movie, and there definitely was a final score: a 7-1 Astros win built on a pair of two-run home runs off Ross, by Yordan Alvarez in the second inning and Carlos Correa in the fourth. Ross deserved his chants. But that four-run deficit rendered moot a pitchers\u2019 duel, which Scherzer vs Cole might\u2019ve been.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that you got to have heart, you also must have bats to score some runs. For the third straight game, the Nats were suffocated. This time, at least they had an excuse \u2014 Cole looked every bit like the guy struck out 363 batters this season, including these playoffs.\n\nStrasburg may not need a great deal of support in Game 6, but this offense will need more than the one run it produced in each of the games at Nationals Park.\n\nAD\n\nWhat the sight of Scherzer, as well as his words, should underscore to fans is the incredible amount of pain and endurance required to play major league baseball. Scouts like to describe a player\u2019s five tools \u2014 hit, hit for power, run, field and throw. The sixth, acknowledged if unspoken, is always \u201cavailability.\u201d Can you master or train your body to play when others might not be able to stand?\n\nAD\n\nRecently, I asked Ryan Zimmerman, 35, how long it took him to \u201cprepare\u201d for a game with all the therapies, massages, chiropractic procedures, stretching and injury-specific exercises he required to loosen or alleviate his chronically injured heel, back and shoulder, as well as any new dings incurred during a 162-game season.\n\n\u201cHours, every day,\u201d Zimmerman said, \u201cjust to be able to get on the field. And that\u2019s when you\u2019re \u2018healthy.\u2019 People have no idea.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey also don\u2019t want to hear about it. And they shouldn\u2019t have to hear about it,\u201d said Zimmerman, who actually refused to explain or list what he does to get ready that can take two to three hours.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just part of the game \u2014 always has been. We\u2019re well paid,\u201d he said, wryly. \u201cWe love the game. We go through it \u2014 until we can\u2019t.\n\n\u201cA couple of years after every guy retires, they come back around and tell you how great they feel, how young,\u201d Zimmerman said, laughing. \u201cYou think, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s because you just played golf. You aren\u2019t playing pro baseball every day, month after month, anymore.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s all good,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cBut we all know.\u201d\n\nThey all know the times, time after time, when Max Scherzer has found a way to post, to pitch a game you probably thought was masterful when he was just trying to get his body to manufacture a facsimile of a pitching motion until more constant rehabilitation could make him slightly better five days later. The act of throwing over 100 pitches at full force, according to doctors, is an injury, in and of itself \u2014 you just recover from it in four days, then injure yourself again.\n\n\u201cThankfully, from what the doctors say, as long as I have no numbness coming down my arms, you don\u2019t actually deal with any serious long-term damage here,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201c. . . But I can\u2019t pick up my arm right now. So I can\u2019t pitch.\u201d\n\nBut on Wednesday, if there is a Game 7, Max Scherzer will have his spikes on, pacing the dugout, cheering his teammates. Whether he can pitch and how much, only he will know. But if that day and that game come, he won\u2019t be tipping his hand to the Astros.\n\nLet \u2019em worry.\n\nRead more on the World Series:", "description": "Joe Ross couldn\u2019t deliver in his spot start, but Washington has Stephen Strasburg lined up for Game 6.
