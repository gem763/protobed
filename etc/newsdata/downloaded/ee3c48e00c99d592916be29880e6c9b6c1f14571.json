Shortly before the storm made landfall an earthquake shook the area.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude 5.3 quake was centered in the ocean off the coast of Chiba, near Tokyo.\n\nAt least one person is confirmed dead. A man died after a tornado flipped over his car.\n\nFlooding was reported Saturday south of Tokyo. Rivers have swelled and boats have flipped. Mudslide warnings have also been issued.\n\n\"Be ready for rainfall of the kind that you have never experienced,\" said meteorological agency official Yasushi Kajihara, adding that areas usually safe from disasters may prove vulnerable.\n\n\"Take all measures necessary to save your life,\" he said.\n\nKajihara said people who live near rivers should take shelter on the second floor or higher of any sturdy building if an officially designated evacuation center wasn't easily accessible. He also expressed fears that disaster may have already struck in some areas.\n\nHagibis, which means \"speed\" in Filipino, was advancing north-northwestward with maximum sustained winds of 144 kilometers (90 miles) per hour on Saturday evening, according to the meteorological agency. It was traveling toward Tokyo and northern Japan at a speed of 35 kph (22 mph).\n\nThe storm brought heavy rainfall in wide areas of Japan all day ahead of its landfall, including in Shizuoka and Mie prefectures, southwest of Tokyo, as well as Chiba to the north, which saw power outages and damaged homes in a typhoon last month.\n\nYusuke Ikegaya, a Shizuoka resident who evacuated ahead of the storm, said he was surprised that the nearby river was about to overflow in the morning, hours before the typhoon made landfall.\n\n\"In the 28 years of my life, this is the first time I've had to evacuate even before a typhoon has landed,\" he said.\n\nA couple walks in heavy rain Saturday, Oct. 12, 2019, in Fujisawa, west of Tokyo.

Authorities acted quickly, with warnings issued earlier in the week, including urging people to stay indoors.\n\nSome 17,000 police and military troops were called up, standing ready for rescue operations.\n\nResidents taped up their apartment windows to prevent them from shattering.

Central Japan Railway Co. canceled bullet-train service between Tokyo and Osaka except for several early Saturday trains connecting Nagoya and Osaka. Tokyo Disneyland was closed, while Ginza department stores and smaller shops throughout Tokyo were shuttered.\n\nEvacuation advisories were issued for risk areas, including Shimoda city, west of Tokyo. Dozens of evacuation centers were set up in coastal towns, and people rested on gymnasium floors, saying they hoped their homes were still there after the storm passed.\n\nA typhoon that hit the Tokyo region in 1958 left more than 1,200 people dead and half a million houses flooded.", "description": "Typhoon Hagibis is forecast to be Japan's worst typhoon in six decades", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/12/cb818b7f-d049-4c02-abc9-6efcbb41991c/thumbnail/1200x630/c8ac5c2a6e077979f8819b13921a26d8/japan2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
