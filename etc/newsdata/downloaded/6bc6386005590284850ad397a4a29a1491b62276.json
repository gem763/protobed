There\u2019s also depth in the pitching staff after rookies like Zac Gallen and Alex Young performed well in the season\u2019s final months.\n\nEven better, Arizona appears to have at least a little payroll flexibility to make needed improvements.\n\nThe bad news is the Diamondbacks are still in a division with the Los Angeles Dodgers, who won 106 games and show no signs of slowing down soon.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how many games we finished out of the division, but it was a lot,\u201d Arizona general manager Mike Hazen said. \u201cWe need to make that up. The level of preparation it\u2019s going to take for our players, the front office and the coaching staff offseason-wise is significant.\u201d\n\nWALKER\u2019S EMERGENCE\n\nArizona figured to lose a lot of production when it traded six-time All-Star first baseman Paul Goldschmidt during the offseason. Instead, Christian Walker stepped forward and filled a big part of it.\n\nThe 28-year-old had a breakout season, batting .259 with 29 homers and 73 RBIs. Walker looked like he might never get an extended shot in the big leagues after bouncing between Triple-A and the majors for four seasons, but finally seized his opportunity.\n\nNow he could be a big part of the D-backs\u2019 future plans.\n\n\u201cI can tell looking around the clubhouse that a lot of people are really excited to get next year going and really looking forward to seeing what we can do,\u201d Walker said.\n\nPITCHING COACH CHANGE\n\nThe Diamondbacks made a somewhat surprising move Monday when they parted ways with pitching coach Mike Butcher after four seasons.\n\nArizona finished with a 4.25 ERA, which ranked seventh out of 15 teams in the NL. The pitching staff remained competitive despite dealing ace Zack Greinke at the trade deadline. Gallen and Young showed promise for the future.\n\nManager Torey Lovullo called it a \u201ctough decision,\u201d but said he believes there\u2019s room for improvement.\n\n\u201cI just think philosophically there were some differences that were happening and I wanted to explore some different angles,\u201d Lovullo said. \u201cI wanted to see what we could get into to make us a little better.\u201d\n\nMAGNIFICENT MARTE, ESCOBAR\n\nThe 25-year-old Marte turned into a superstar this season and will be the centerpiece of the lineup moving forward. He finished second in the NL batting race with a .329 average and added 32 homers, 36 doubles and 10 stolen bases while providing excellent defense in center field, at second base and even occasionally at shortstop.\n\nEscobar also had a career year, batting .269 with 35 homers and 118 RBIs while playing mostly third base.\n\nBACK END HELP\n\nHazen said he\u2019d look into adding some arms in the bullpen during the offseason.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean there will be a new closer. Archie Bradley did well in the role over the season\u2019s final few months. He finished with 18 saves and a 3.52 ERA, striking out 87 over 71 2/3 innings.\n\nLovullo said Bradley would certainly be in the conversation to close.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s earned that right,\u201d Lovullo said. \u201cI think we\u2019d be crazy not to consider him as one of the elite candidates to be closer. We might be too far away from next spring training to have that conversation.\u201d\n\nDEEP ROTATION\n\nLuke Weaver and Taijuan Walker pitched a few innings in the season\u2019s final games, giving hope that both will be good candidates for the starting rotation next year. The pack of contenders is large: Merrill Kelly, Robbie Ray, Taylor Clarke, Mike Leake, Gallen and Young are among those who will also be considered.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Arizona Diamondbacks lost some of their best players to trades or free agency over the past 12 months.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Brandt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/padres_diamondbacks_baseball_11252_c0-151-3600-2249_s1770x1032.jpg?86a0ad2941f4f8cac64fde118e16286d6ebd0c8d", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
