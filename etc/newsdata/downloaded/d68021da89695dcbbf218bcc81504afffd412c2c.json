The press secretary and the communications team has delegated out the job of answering questions from the reporters covering the White House to the president himself.\n\nIt\u2019s President Trump\u2019s idea, to be sure, to be his own spokesman. It\u2019s not even a bad idea for him to do so. Those most upset are the reporters themselves. The typical American isn\u2019t keeping up with daily press briefings at the White House, as used to be the routine, because they have lives of their own to attend to.\n\nMonday, during an appearance on Fox and Friends, White House Press Secretary and communications director Stephanie Grisham was asked by co-host Brian Kilmeade if she would be holding regular press briefings again. Nah, not so much, as essentially her answer.\n\n\u201cNot right now,\u201d Grisham told the hosts of \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d when asked whether the White House will resume its daily press briefing, a longstanding practice under President Donald Trump\u2019s predecessors. \u201cI mean, ultimately, if the president decides that it\u2019s something we should do, we can do that, but right now he\u2019s doing just fine,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd to be honest, the briefings have become a lot of theater. And I think that a lot of reporters were doing it to get famous. I mean, yeah, they\u2019re writing books now. I mean, they\u2019re all getting famous off of this presidency. And so, I think it\u2019s great what we\u2019re doing now.\u201d\n\nFair enough, actually. I regularly watched the briefings and since the Trump administration came into office, the tone has been one not seen before. There has always been friction between presidents and reporters but the vitriol is at an all-time high. Few reporters view Trump and members of his administration favorably. It\u2019s been a race to the bottom for most reporters. They no longer even pretend to mask their own political opinions.\n\nThe previous Trump press secretaries were beat up regularly during the daily (or semi-daily) briefings. Some take pleasure in being rude and confrontational because it guarantees a sound bite or video clip on their networks later in the day. Grisham said the president didn\u2019t like seeing how Sean Spicer and Sarah Huckabee-Sanders were treated by the press. She said Trump stopped the briefings.\n\nGrisham also suggested that reporters\u2019 criticisms of the president\u2019s previous press secretaries, Sean Spicer and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, played a role in Trump\u2019s decision to discontinue the briefings. \u201cI think that it\u2019s so important that, you know, the spokesperson for the president can adequately speak to his policies and get his message out there, and I think the president saw that that\u2019s not what was happening,\u201d she said. \u201cIt had become, again, theater, and they weren\u2019t being good to his people. And he doesn\u2019t like that. He\u2019s very loyal to his people, and he put a stop to it.\u201d\n\nI agree that Trump is his own best spokesman. He may be unconventional in his message delivery but Americans respond to it. He relies on Twitter to spread his messages and his tweets are seen by more people than the press briefings. Trump always stops and answers questions from the White House press pool when he goes to board Marine One at the White House. It isn\u2019t unusual for him to stand and answer questions for as long as 15 or 20 minutes. Past presidents never gave the press that kind of accessibility. Isn\u2019t an answer coming for the president himself better than from a third party?\n\nGrisham hasn\u2019t held a press briefing on camera yet. Her appearance on Fox and Friends was her first in her new job. She did weigh in on the ongoing Ukraine story. We\u2019ve gone from Russia, Russia, Russia to Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe president made it very clear he did absolutely nothing wrong. This is just another reason for Democrats and for the media to attack and look for things that just aren\u2019t there,\u201d she said.\n\nPerhaps Grisham will be the first White House press secretary to completely do away with on-camera briefings. Reporters trying to become celebrities will have to take another avenue to capture attention for book deals and late-night show guest interviews.", "description": "A thing of the past?", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
