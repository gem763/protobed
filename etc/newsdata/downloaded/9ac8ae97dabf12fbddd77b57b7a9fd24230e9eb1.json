A previous attempt by Sondland to testify was blocked by the state department, as part of a blanket White House defiance of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nCongress is also due this week to receive relevant documents from an array of the most powerful figures in the administration, including the vice-president, the defense secretary and the White House chief of staff.\n\nOut of the flow of new information, congressional investigators hope to fill in the picture of the Trump administration\u2019s dealings in Ukraine, and answer the question of whether Trump\u2019s conduct rises to the \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d cited in the constitution as grounds for impeachment.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry was sparked by a whistleblower complaint filed in August that in part described a 25 July phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which Trump requested the \u201cfavor\u201d of an investigation into a potential 2020 rival, Joe Biden.\n\nTrump and Republicans have repeated unproven allegations of corruption against Hunter Biden, the former vice-president\u2019s son who was on the board of a gas company in the eastern European country while his father was involved in international efforts to curb corruption in its government.\n\nThe stark nature of Trump\u2019s request to Zelenskiy has boosted support for Trump\u2019s impeachment, according to polling averages.\n\nThe administration has struggled to find a message to rebut the perception of its own corruption, with the president, at times seemingly alone in his own defense, lashing out on Twitter against Democrats, the whistleblower, the media, Biden and more.\n\nHill\u2019s testimony could significantly add to allegations of wrongdoing by Trump and Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor commonly described as the president\u2019s personal lawyer, who headed up the president\u2019s personal agenda in Ukraine while working on behalf of local clients of his own. Both Trump and Giuliani have denied wrongdoing.\n\nHill\u2019s testimony was expected to center on the recall of Yovanovitch, a widely respected diplomat who worked under six presidents and who defied the state department gag order to testify herself last Friday.\n\nYovanovitch said she had been the target of a smear campaign inside the administration fueled by Giuliani.\n\n\u201cI do not know Mr Giuliani\u2019s motives for attacking me,\u201d Yovanovitch said in an opening statement released to the press. \u201cBut individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nTwo Giuliani business associates from the former Soviet Union, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested at a Washington DC-area airport last week on suspected campaign finance violations regarding a large check they wrote to a political committee supporting Trump and donations to at least one Republican congressman, Pete Sessions of Texas.\n\nAfter a May 2018 meeting between Parnas and Sessions, Sessions sent a letter to secretary of state Mike Pompeo urging Yovanovitch\u2019s dismissal because she had \u201cspoken privately and repeatedly about her disdain for the current administration\u201d.\n\nYovanovitch denied the charge but she was dismissed nevertheless, in a move potentially driven by Ukrainians elements she was ostensibly charged with confronting and helping to dismantle.\n\nIt was also reported last week that Giuliani himself is the subject of an investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan.\n\nAs the first former White House aide to testify in the impeachment inquiry, Hill could be in a position to describe internal, and apparently heated, conversations among diplomats and security officials that led to Yovanovitch\u2019s departure.\n\nDonald Trump: xenophobe in public, international mobster in private | Robert Reich Read more\n\nA Russia expert fluent in the language, Hill was a senior official at the Washington-based Brookings institution before joining the Trump administration. She announced her resignation in June, before the July phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy, and left the White House in August.\n\nA third career public official, Kurt Volker, the former US special envoy to Ukraine, testified before Congress two weeks ago. He handed over lengthy text exchanges among US diplomats negotiating the idea of a White House visit for Zelenskiy if the Ukrainian president announced an investigation of Biden.\n\nSources close to Sondland, who in the text exchanges wrote \u201cI think potus really wants the deliverable\u201d, have said he will testify that he took Trump at his word when the president denied he was pursuing a quid pro quo with Ukraine.\n\nInvestigators will have a chance to ask Sondland what he meant, in that case, by \u201cdeliverable\u201d.", "description": "Former top aide\u2019s testimony could add to allegations of wrongdoing by Trump in impeachment inquiry", "authors": ["Tom Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d0c6f5b5cf5ac94e1e960367f6022f476ddf004/0_89_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=513708a0291fca71f58f7c0a599a35fa", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
