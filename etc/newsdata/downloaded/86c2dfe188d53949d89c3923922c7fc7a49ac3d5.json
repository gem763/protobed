Prudential lost 10%.\n\nAmong midcaps, Capital & Counties Properties jumped 8.2% after luxury property developer Nicholas Candy's investment arm said it was in early talks for a possible cash offer for the property manager. fastener maker Trifast plunged 15% on the UK small-cap index after forecasting lower earnings for the year, while peer-to-peer lending platform Funding Circle advanced 7% after reporting strong loan growth.
