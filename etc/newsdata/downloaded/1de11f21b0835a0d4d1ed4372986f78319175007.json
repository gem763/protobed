House committees have asked them to turn over all documents and communications related to the donations and have sought depositions from both men.\n\nAD\n\nSince late 2018, the two Florida-based business executives have been assisting Giuliani\u2019s push to get Ukrainian officials to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son, as well as Giuliani\u2019s claim that Democrats conspired with Ukrainians in the 2016 campaign. They have also been pursuing opportunities in Ukraine for a new liquefied-natural-gas venture.\n\nAD\n\nParnas, a 47-year-old former stockbroker who was born in Ukraine, has told The Washington Post that Giuliani is an attorney for the two men but declined to say what services he is providing them.\n\nParnas said he and Fruman helped set up a Skype call for Giuliani in late 2018 with Viktor Shokin, the ousted prosecutor general, and an in-person meeting in New York in January 2019 with Yuri Lutsenko, then Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general.\n\nAD\n\nParnas made his first large political contribution in 2016, when he gave $50,000 to Trump Victory, a joint fundraising committee for the Republican National Committee, the Trump campaign and GOP state parties, campaign finance records show.\n\nParnas told The Post that he decided to get involved politically because he was a passionate supporter of Trump\u2019s candidacy after growing up in New York and selling Trump condos in the city when Trump\u2019s late father, Fred, was still running the Trump Organization.\n\nAD\n\nIn May 2018, about six months before the men began working with Giuliani on his Biden investigation, a Florida business established by Parnas received a $1.26 million wire transfer from an account whose owner was represented by a real estate lawyer who specializes in assisting foreign buyers of U.S. property, court documents and corporate filings show.\n\nAD\n\nTwo days later, America First, the main pro-Trump super PAC, reported receiving $325,000 from a company Parnas and Fruman had incorporated the previous month called Global Energy Producers.\n\nLast year, the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center filed a still-pending complaint with the Federal Election Commission over the donation, alleging that it appeared to be a straw donation that masked the identity of the original contributor.\n\nParnas told the Miami Herald last week that the money for the super PAC donation was from proceeds from the sale of a Miami-area condominium. Kelly Sadler, a spokeswoman for the super PAC, has declined to comment on \u201congoing legal matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can tell you that we scrupulously adhere to all laws and regulations,\u201d she said.\n\nThe real estate lawyer involved in the transfer, Russell S. Jacobs, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAD", "description": "Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who routed a large donation to a pro-Trump super PAC, are accused of taking part in a scheme to funnel foreign money to candidates for federal and state office.", "authors": ["Devlin Barrett", "Reporter Focusing On National Security", "Law Enforcement", "John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/baPmH9mTxtza9J-Y2sjuVYU9vnA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NAS5R7HLMYI6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
