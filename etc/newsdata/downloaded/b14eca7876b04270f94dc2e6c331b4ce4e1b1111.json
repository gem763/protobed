Mr. Trump made the statement several minutes into his remarks before the group of about 50 mission employees and their families at the event intended to honor the mission. At the outset, he condemned the former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s role in Ukraine at a time when his son Hunter Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nMr. Trump repeatedly referred to the whistle-blower and condemned the news media reporting on the complaint as \u201ccrooked.\u201d He then said the whistle-blower never heard the call in question.\n\n\u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person who gave the whistle-blower the information because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d", "description": "\u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right?\u201d the president asked a room of American diplomats.", "authors": ["Maggie Haberman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/us/26dc-trump-promo/26dc-trump-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
