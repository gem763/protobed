The Wall Street Journal first reported the distributors\u2019 offer Tuesday. The money would be paid out in annual $1 billion increments, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are private.\n\nJ&J and the distributors -- which deliver the majority of prescription medications to U.S. pharmacies -- made the proposal in talks with a group of state attorneys general, the people said. The proposals came on the eve of the first federal trial in Cleveland over responsibility for the public-health crisis tied to opioids.\n\nShares of J&J gained 2.2% at 10:38 a.m. in New York on Wednesday, while McKesson shares rose 7.4%, Cardinal rose 5.7% and AmerisourceBergen gained 6.4%.\n\nTeva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., another drug manufacturer targeted in the nationwide litigation, offered to give away more than $15 billion in generic drugs, including those that help fight opioid overdoses, to resolve all of its cases, said the people. That agreement would run over 10 years, the people said.\n\nIsrael-based Teva\u2019s shares rose 6.3% in New York on news of the settlement proposal. Teva\u2019s bonds were among the top performers in the U.S. high-yield market on Wednesday, according to Trace bond trading data. The company\u2019s 6% unsecured bonds rose more than 1.5 cents on the dollar to around 91.5.\n\nOther opioid manufacturers implicated in the federal trial, including Mallinckrodt and Endo, also rose in the wake of the news.\n\nIf all the proposals are accepted, the Cleveland trial likely will be put off given that the three distributors and Teva are the main defendants, the people said. In the trial, two counties are seeking reimbursement for the hundreds of millions in tax dollars spent on the fallout from opioid addictions and overdoses.\u201cAs we\u2019ve stated previously, we remain open to viable options to resolve these cases, including through settlement,\u201d Ernie Knewitz, a J&J spokesman, said in an emailed statement.U.S.-based Teva spokeswoman Kelley Dougherty declined to comment on the proposed deal. AmerisourceBergen spokesman Gabriel Weissman and Brandi Martin, a Cardinal Health spokeswoman, also declined to comment. McKesson spokeswoman Sunny Rodriguez didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nSamantha Fisher, a spokeswoman for Tennessee Attorney Herbert Slatery III, didn\u2019t respond to an emailed request for comment, sent after regular business hours. Slatery is one of the leaders of the negotiations.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time J&J has put serious money on the table to end its opioid liability, the people said. The drugmaker agreed earlier this month to pay $20.4 million to two Ohio counties to avoid a federal trial, but that didn\u2019t extend to any other opioid claim. Some analysts have said it may take as much as $150 billion to resolve all the opioid cases on file.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s settlement of two opioid cases in Ohio, if reflective of a global settlement, is in-line with our expectation that it could pay up to $5 billion. The news, along with its lower-than-expected Oklahoma fine, may indicate J&J won\u2019t have to contribute much more than others based on its ability to pay.\n\n-- Sam Fazeli, senior pharmaceutical analyst\n\nClick here to view the research\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very rare for J&J to do anything else other than litigate these kinds of cases to the bitter end,\u201d said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor who teaches about mass torts. \u201cI think investors are going to be very happy they are talking global settlement.\u201d\n\nTobias said an Oklahoma judge\u2019s decision to hit J&J with $572 million in damages over its sales of opioid painkillers in that state may have sent J&J an unmistakable signal. That judge acknowledged Tuesday that he made a $107 million error in his damages ruling and cut the award to $420 million.\u201cThat ruling may have showed them that no matter where they try those cases, they are going to have trouble persuading judges and juries they shouldn\u2019t be on the hook for the costs of the opioid crisis,\u201d Tobias said.The distributors\u2019 latest proposal is $8 billion higher than the $10 billion offer they made in August. The National Association of Attorneys General, the group sponsoring talks on behalf of more than 35 states, countered with a demand for $45 billion at the time.The drug distributors generate large amounts of cash that could be used to pay a settlement. In its 2019 fiscal year, San Francisco-based McKesson generated $4.04 billion from operations, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In fiscal 2018, Cardinal brought in $2.77 billion and AmerisourceBergen $1.41 billion.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Johnson & Johnson has offered to pay $4 billion to settle all claims accusing the company of helping fuel the U.S. opioid epidemic, as part of a potentially larger deal involving drugmakers and distributors that could top $20 billion.J&J\u2019s overture came on the heels of a proposal by distributors", "authors": ["Jef Feeley", "Riley Griffin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6_zj6rvJALhzURMEruipYQ--~B/aD0yNDAwO3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/93b2575ea8a022501ed2e35e65422466", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
