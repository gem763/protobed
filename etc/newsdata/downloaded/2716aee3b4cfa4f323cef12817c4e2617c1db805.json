Rates of blindness in low- and middle-income countries are up to eight times higher than in wealthy countries, with people living in rural areas, ethnic minorities, women and older people suffering disproportionately.\n\nAt least 2.2 billion people live with a visual impairment or blindness. One billion of these cases \u2013 conditions like short and far-sightedness, cataracts and glaucoma \u2013 could either have been prevented or treated.\n\nDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO\u2019s director general, said: \u201cIt is unacceptable that 65 million people are blind or have impaired sight when their vision could have been corrected overnight with a cataract operation, or that over 800 million struggle in everyday activities because they lack access to a pair of glasses.\u201d\n\nAccess to eye care varies considerably in different parts of the world. People who need support for distance vision impairments who live in low- and middle-income regions are four times less likely to receive the help they need than in high income areas.\n\nThe report, published on Tuesday, estimates it would cost $14.3bn (\u00a311.7bn) to treat the billion people already living with visual impairment or blindness from cataracts, and short- and far-sightedness.\n\nAn ageing population together with inadequate nutrition mean that the number of people with eye conditions is projected to rise significantly.\n\nKirsty Smith, chief executive of disability inclusion NGO Christian Blind Mission UK, said: \u201cDespite decades of work to improve access to eye health, there are still millions of people worldwide needlessly losing their sight to conditions like cataracts \u2013 and in recent years we\u2019ve seen new challenges emerging, such as increasing levels of diabetes-related sight loss and ageing-related visual impairment across the world.\u201d\n\nApproximately 11.9 million people have impaired vision or blindness caused by glaucoma, diabetes and trachoma that could have been avoided. Preventing these cases would have cost $5.8bn, according to the report, which sets out the long term societal and economic impact for those affected and their families or carers.\n\nDr Alarcos Cieza, who leads WHO\u2019s work on blindness and vision impairment, said: \u201cMillions of people have severe vision impairment and are not able to participate in society to their fullest because they can\u2019t access rehabilitation services. In a world built on the ability to see, eye care services, including rehabilitation, must be provided closer to communities for people to achieve their maximum potential.\u201d\n\nBold vision: giving blind people back their sight in Pakistan \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nJuliet Milgate, director of policy and advocacy at Sightsavers, said: \u201cConsiderable progress in eye health has been made but serious challenges remain and there are significant unmet needs.\n\n\u201cThe report is a call to action for all states. We hope it will lead to greater awareness, galvanise political will and deliver better eye health for all, particularly those who are most marginalised.\u201d\n\nWHO argued that people who need eye care should be able to access it without facing financial hardship.\n\n\u201cIncluding eye care in national health plans and essential packages of care is an important part of every country\u2019s journey towards universal health coverage,\u201d said Tedros.\n\nJames Chen, founder of initiatives Clearly and Vision for a Nation, said: \u201cPoor vision is a ticking time-bomb that impacts the education, work and quality of life of around a third of the world\u2019s population, particularly women. The simple solution of a pair of glasses has existed for over 700 years. The world must make 2020 a year of action.\u201d", "description": "Operation could have corrected vision of many \u2018overnight\u2019, while 800 million struggle because they lack access to glasses, according to WHO", "authors": ["Lucy Lamble"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efd628cf07e4891d0abf44170b1dec75cc207453/0_610_5384_3230/master/5384.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2db00accdb616dd115114e6e21a1b8be", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
