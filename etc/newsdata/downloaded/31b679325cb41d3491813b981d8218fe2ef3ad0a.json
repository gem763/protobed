They have won a lot. The Detroit Lions have not.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nMatt Patricia is doing things \u201cThe Patriot Way.\u201d This week the Lions traded popular safety Quandre Diggs, a captain and leader, to the Seattle Seahawks for virtually nothing. Lions players weren\u2019t happy.\n\nAnd Diggs was as surprised as anyone.\n\nQuandre Diggs \u2018blindsided\u2019\n\nDiggs said he was taking a nap with his three-month-old daughter when he got traded, according to NBC Sports Northwest. He woke up to multiple missed calls, and called his agent. His agent told him he was traded to Seattle.\n\n\u201cMan, I\u2019m asleep, I\u2019m not headed to Seattle,\u201d Diggs said he told his agent, according to NBC Sports Northwest. \u201cWhat do you mean? It\u2019s an off day.\u201d\n\nHis agent informed him again that he was traded to the Seahawks.\n\n\u201cI was blindsided by it, honestly,\u201d Diggs said.\n\nEveryone seemed to be surprised. Seahawks coach Pete Carroll didn\u2019t figure Diggs was even available.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re lucky to get him,\u201d Pete Carroll said, according to NBC Sports Northwest. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think that could be possible. We were looking, and it happened to pop up just right.\u201d\n\nDiggs trade was surprising\n\nA couple weeks ago, the Lions were 2-1-1 and were in good shape. Losses to Green Bay and Minnesota weren\u2019t good, but at 2-3-1 the Lions weren\u2019t out of playoff contention yet.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat\u2019s why the Diggs trade was odd. And it\u2019s not just the trade in a vacuum. It\u2019s the ongoing referendum on Patricia as Lions coach. Patricia has done a lot of things to create waves in Detroit. This season seemed a lot calmer in regards to off-field headlines with players being unhappy with his style. Then the Diggs trade happened.\n\nLong, long ago, the Patriots cut safety Lawyer Milloy. He was popular, and a captain. It upset some of his teammates. That move ended up being the best example of Bill Belichick making moves that might be unpopular but generally work out. That came in 2003, after New England had already won a Super Bowl. Patricia is 8-13-1 as Lions coach.\n\nMany of Belichick\u2019s assistants have failed, and a common thread has been copying things the Patriots do that might not necessarily work out in other places, without Belichick\u2019s Hall-of-Fame coaching acumen to make it work. But hey, Patricia got his Lawyer Milloy moment. Now we wait to see if the same type of Patriots-level success follows.\n\nSafety Quandre Diggs was surprised by a trade from the Lions to Seahawks.
