He says Jones needs Adesanya a lot more than Adesanya needs him.\n\nAnd he\u2019d rather see \u201cThe Last Stylebender\u201d face heavyweight champ Miocic instead.\n\n\u201cJon Jones 100 percent needs Israel,\u201d Bareman said on Submission Radio. \u201cIsrael does not need Jon Jones at all. Israel is baiting Jon Jones at every corner, and Jon Jones just keeps biting because Jon Jones knows he needs Israel. Let\u2019s not talk about Jon Jones. Let\u2019s talk about Stipe. If we have to talk about this superfight, let\u2019s talk about Stipe. Let\u2019s talk about Israel going up. Has anybody gone up and won two titles, but skipped a division? Well, there you go. There\u2019s a bit of history.\u201d\n\nThe City Kickboxing head coach had a perfect night in Melbourne, Australia, with Brad Riddell making good on his UFC debut, Dan Hooker emerging as a lightweight contender, and Adesanya unifying the 185-pound title. He criticized Jones for his reluctance to move up to heavyweight.\n\nHe said Adesanya would have no hesitation to do so.\n\n\u201cJon Jones so far has not been willing to go to heavyweight,\u201d Bareman said. \u201cHe\u2019s been reluctant to go to heavyweight. Am I correct? Well, Israel wouldn\u2019t be reluctant to go to heavyweight. Israel would go to heavyweight and he would fight Stipe Miocic. There you go. We\u2019ll take that fight, Jon Jones. If you don\u2019t want to take it, you can hang around at light heavyweight. We\u2019ll skip light heavyweight and we\u2019ll take that fight off you. There\u2019s some more bait there, so Jon Jones can bite on it and start doing what he does, like what these guys do. But we\u2019ll take the fight. Don\u2019t worry about it, Jon Jones.\u201d\n\nFor now, Adesanya, who already said is focused on defending his title and being an active champ, has a big task ahead of him. Paulo Costa, who defeated Yoel Romero at UFC 241, sat front row to watch him win the title at UFC 243 and is Adesanya\u2019s likely first title defense.\n\nThe two exchanged words when Adesanya walked out of the cage, and all signs are pointing at the matchup being the next middleweight title fight.\n\nBareman wants his star student to focus on Costa then possibly Miocic, rather than Jones.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s stop talking about Jon Jones \u2013 let\u2019s talk about Stipe,\u201d Bareman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bit to do. We\u2019ve got Paulo Costa, we\u2019ve got other things. But yeah, let\u2019s talk about that. Let\u2019s stop talking about Jon Jones and the big matchup. There\u2019s bigger matchups than Jon Jones. How about a guy going up two weight divisions to claim another title?\u201d", "description": "Israel Adesanya's coach says Jon Jones needs Adesanya a lot more than Adesanya needs him.
