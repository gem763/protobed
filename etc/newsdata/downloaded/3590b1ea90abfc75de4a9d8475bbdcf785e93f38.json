(AP) \u2014 Leon Draisaitl scored the only goal in the shootout to give the undefeated Edmonton Oilers a 4-3 victory over the winless New Jersey Devils on Thursday night.\n\nDraisaitl, who also scored in regulation, connected in the third round of the shootout as the Oilers improved to 4-0-0.\n\nJames Neal and Connor McDavid also had Oilers goals. Mikko Koskinen stopped 28 shots.\n\nKyle Palmieri, Nikita Gusev and Damon Severson scored for New Jersey (0-2-2). Mackenzie Blackwood made 19 saves.\n\nSeverson scored late in the third period to give the Devils their third lead of the game. Severson, set up by Taylor Hall, scored his first of the season from the bottom of the left circle with 4:25 remaining.\n\nThe lead did not stand as McDavid forced the overtime, scoring a power-play goal with 1:06 left in regulation.\n\nThe whistle blew as McDavid knocked the puck past Blackwood on a scramble in front. The referees went to a video review before confirming the tying goal.\n\nIn the overtime, Hall had two outstanding chances for the Devils, including a shot off the post.\n\nThe red-hot Neal scored on the power play with 27.8 seconds remaining in the second period to pull the Oilers even at 2-2.\n\nNeal, who leads the NHL with seven goals, deflected Ryan Nugent-Hopkins' shot to knot the score with his fifth goal in the last two games.\n\nNeal's seven goals are a team record for Edmonton for the most through the first four games of a season. Wayne Gretzky held the old mark at six.\n\nEarlier in the period, Gusev took a feed from Jesper Bratt and hammered a shot from the top of the right circle to give the Devils their second lead at 2-1.\n\nThe teams exchanged goals in the opening period as Palmieri and Draisaitl scored.\n\nPalmieri put the Devils on the board at 6:14 with a great individual effort. Palmieri, playing in his 500th game, blocked an Oilers shot and sped up ice with Hall on a 2-on-1 break. Palmieri took the shot, rifling the puck over Koskinen's left shoulder for an unassisted tally.\n\nDraisaitl evened it up at 9:17, whipping home a shot from the left circle after a perfect setup feed from Darnell Nurse.\n\nP.K. Subban left the Devils bench early in the period, leaving New Jersey seriously shorthanded on the blueline. They were already missing defenseman Andy Greene, a pregame scratch with an upper body injury.\n\nSubban returned for the start of the second period.\n\nThe game featured five players selected first overall in the NHL draft: Jack Hughes, Nico Hischier and Taylor Hall (by the Oilers) for New Jersey; Connor McDavid and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins for Edmonton.\n\nNOTES: The Oilers have two games left on a four-game trip \u2014 Saturday afternoon at Madison Square Garden and Monday night in Chicago. ... New Jersey swept both games with Edmonton last season. ... Mirco Mueller replaced Greene on the New Jersey backline. ... The other Devils move was reinserting C Pavel Zacha in place of John Hayden. ... The Oilers scratched C Colby Cave, RW Alex Chiasson and D Brandon Manning.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nOilers: At New York Rangers on Saturday afternoon.\n\nDevils: At Boston on Saturday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
