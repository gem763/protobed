Bitcoin whales get rich by selling now to realize their paper gains before a market crash wipes them out. The whales must make sure the hodlers don't lose faith and cash out so that they can cash in!\u201d\n\nGold recent tumble\n\nSchiff\u2019s comments come after a week of dazzling market gains for the top cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin (BTC) posting its highest intraday gain \u2014 at 42% \u2014 since 2011.\n\nAgainst gold, Bitcoin was up by over 30% on Oct. 26, prior to Schiff\u2019s remarks.\n\nTwitter respondents retorted that the pattern was hardly unique to digital asset classes; those less generous sarcastically quipped that for Schiff, only gold is immune to such trading gambits.\n\nOn Oct. 29, gold notably fell to a one-week low amid buoyant investor sentiment in the wider markets, with many hopeful of a United States-China trade deal.\n\nA hawkish interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve could, however, be bullish for the precious metal, with lower rates reducing opportunity costs for holders.\n\nA store of value for the digital era\n\nAs reported, Schiff has been resoundingly and consistently bearish in his forecasts for Bitcoin.\n\nMounting recognition of the latter as a safe-haven asset has contributed to its moniker as \u201cdigital gold\u201d and the cryptocurrency has more frequently fallen into close-step correlation with physical gold at several points in recent market cycles.\n\nIndustry commentators point to the increasingly fraught issue of central bank policy as bullish \u201crocket fuel\u201d for Bitcoin\u2019s price performance.", "description": "HODLer of a bygone era, Peter Schiff has argued that retail investors are getting squeezed by whales\u2019 tactics on the cryptocurrency markets", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8yY2ViYmEyMjFhMzZiMDJlMWMxOWVhZTkwYjVlYTEzZS5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
