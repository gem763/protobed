Especially when it comes to medicine. Balancing biles? Bleeding with leeches? Driving out evil spirits? It all seems so medieval. Still, some of our most colorful language comes from those ancient practices\u2014like \u201cbiting the bullet\u201d (which you\u2019d do before the days of anesthesia), or saying \u201cI\u2019ve got a gut feeling.\u201d Turns out, that last one isn\u2019t so silly after all. Recent research has been pointing to one inescapable conclusion: Your gut is responsible for a large part of your mood. Or, to be more specific, your gut\u2019s microbiome affects the production of many mood-producing hormones. Some feelings really do come from your gut. Today, I\u2019ll show you what we\u2019re discovering about the link between gut microbiomes\u2014the probiotics, or \u201cgood bacteria\u201d that live in your gut\u2014and mood. And then I\u2019ll show you how you can have the healthiest, cleanest microbiome around. And why that might brighten your days more than anything else.\n\nYour second brain\n\nYou know that feeling of butterflies in your stomach before an important event? You aren\u2019t just imagining it. It turns out, there is an entire network of neurons that line your gut. 100 million in total\u2014more than you\u2019d find in your spinal cord. There are so many neurons that some scientists call this network your \u201csecond brain.\u201d Now, let\u2019s be clear\u2014there isn\u2019t any conscious thought going on here. When you are contemplating the works of Descartes, your intestines aren\u2019t chiming in. Rather, this network of neurons is responsible for all the mechanics of digestion. From squeezing food down the esophagus, to extracting nutrients in the intestine, this neural network is doing the work independent of your brain. But that\u2019s not all. Your second brain also produces the vast majority of your body\u2019s serotonin . Also known as the \u201cfeel good\u201d neurotransmitter in your brain, interestingly enough 80%-90% of your serotonin is made and found in your gut. Serotonin is extremely important for instructing muscles to constrict, carrying impulses between nerves, regulating cyclic processes within the body, and regulating mood as well. In addition to serotonin, the bacteria that make up your microbiome produce their own set of important, influential chemicals. In a very real way, your gut is more responsible for your feelings than your head. Seems like ancient beliefs about \u201cgut feelings\u201d were onto something.\n\nHow bacteria change your mood\n\nHow to have a happy gut\n\nHowever, one thing that the ancients didn\u2019t understand is the microbiome . Even today, the interaction between your body and the bacteria that call it home aren\u2019t all that well understood. In many ways, we\u2019re still in the dark. We don\u2019t understand how the interactions take place. But one thing we know for sure: Interactions are happening. Your microbiome is influencing the neurons in your gut, the production of serotonin, and your mood. In lab tests, we\u2019ve been able to influence the mood and behavior of animals just by replacing their microbiomes. For instance, we can give a shy mouse the microbiome of an adventurous one\u2014and it will become bolder and more adventurous. Or vice versa. We can give a normal rat the microbiome from an obese one, and the rat will immediately start to act like an obese one. There is even a tentative theory that a malfunctioning microbiome is responsible for autism in children\u2014explaining why autistic children often also have gastrointestinal problems.The next few years will see a flowering of research in this new field, and I\u2019m expecting a number of breakthroughs. We may discover that a malfunctioning microbiome is responsible for a whole host of psychological and physiological diseases, from autism to depression to who knows what else. In extreme cases, we may start treating some of these diseases with microbiome replacement\u2014basically, cleaning out the old bacteria and putting healthy samples in their place. But there\u2019s a simpler way to achieve the same thing, and to do it starting today. You see, in many ways, you\u2019re responsible for your own microbiome. What you feed yourself has a huge influence on what bacteria thrive. And we know exactly what good bacteria like. So follow this simple three-step plan, and your microbiome will be in great shape:\n\nEat prebiotics. Prebiotics are basically the favorite food of bacteria.\n\nTake probiotics. Probiotics are the healthy, good bacteria you want in your gut.\n\nDon\u2019t kill the little ones. The easiest way to mess up a microbiome is by wiping out your current one.\n\nBut it goes beyond simply feeding the bacteria. Your food isn\u2019t just their food\u2014it\u2019s also their entire environment. So you need to give them the best possible environment in which to thrive. Luckily, we know exactly what that means. Fiber\u2014and lots of it. Foods rich in fiber \u2014like fruits and vegetables\u2014make for a very healthy microbiome. Unsurprisingly, they make for a very healthy human as well. So make an effort to increase your fiber uptake, starting today.Once you\u2019ve made the perfect habitat for them\u2014by eating lots and lots of fiber\u2014make sure to put the good bacteria in there. Like it or not, your gut is always full of bacteria. But sometimes unwanted guests are part of the mix. By taking a quality probiotic supplement, you\u2019re giving beneficial bacteria the best chance of thriving.And that\u2019s very easy to do. If you take antibiotics, those medicines don\u2019t just kill infections\u2014they kill all bacteria. Avoid antibiotics except in cases of true need. Likewise, avoid eating anything caustic or toxic. That sounds simple enough\u2014but remember, most of your processed food contains preservatives that can do plenty of harm to the bacteria of a microbiome. Bottom line\u2014eat as many healthy, whole foods as possible. Avoid artificial preservatives and additives. And keep a steady flow of healthy bacteria heading towards your gut. Today, the best science indicates this will do more than help your digestion and health. It may also directly lift your mood, as well.\n\nReference", "description": "We often laugh about the foolish things the ancients believed. .09/02/2019 3:12:27AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
