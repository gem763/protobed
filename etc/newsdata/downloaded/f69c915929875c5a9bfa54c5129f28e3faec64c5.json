Here are the report's key takeaways:\n\n--Pending home sales, contract signings for purchases of previously owned homes, increased 1.5% in September from August. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 0.7% increase in September pending home sales.\n\n--Pending home sales were up 3.9% in September from a year earlier.\n\n--Low mortgage rates helped underpin the second straight monthly increase, said Lawrence Yun, the trade group's chief economist. \"Even though home prices are rising faster than income, national buying power has increased by 6% because of better interest rates,\" he said.\n\n--More broadly, the housing market has sputtered recently as a lack of available homes and rising prices have restrained home buying. The NAR said last week sales of previously owned U.S. homes fell 2.2% in September from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.38 million.\n\nWrite to Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 29, 2019 10:14 ET (14:14 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
