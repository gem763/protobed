The letter specifically knocked San Francisco. It was the latest move in the political battle between Trump and the nation\u2019s largest state, and one experts have said carries\n\n.\n\nThe EPA pushed back in a statement, saying California\u2019s failures on air and water create \u201cpubic health risks\u201d for its population.\n\n\"Highlighting that California has the worst air quality in the nation along with other serious environmental problems is not a political issue. The Trump Administration, unlike the previous administration, will act to protect public health and the environment for all Americans,\" EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said.\n\nThe letter from the former employees comes as the Environmental Integrity Project unveiled an investigatory deep dive that found via the EPA\u2019s enforcement database that many states, not just California, were out of compliance with EPA regulations when it comes to wastewater discharge violations.\n\nAccording to the internal EPA data, Ohio, New York and Iowa were the biggest offenders.\n\nThe group found 429 major sources across the country are in \u201csignificant noncompliance\u201d for either discharging more pollution than allowed under their permits or for not meeting deadlines for compliance. All of the information they highlighted is found publicly on EPA\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cOn September 26, you wrote to the Governor of California to express concern about, 'numerous exceedances' of Clean Water Act discharge limits for major sources and noted that the violations were serious enough to, 'suggest the need for more formal and in-depth EPA oversight.' We ask that you give equally close scrutiny to Clean Water Act violations at large municipal or industrial wastewater treatment plants in other states,\u201d the group wrote in a separate letter to Wheeler on Thursday.\n\nWhile Wheeler, who is from Ohio, said the EPA keeps an eye on all states that fall behind their pollution enforcement obligations, he said in September that California was the only state to receive such a warning.\n\n\u201cAndrew Wheeler should look at his own backyard, if he wants to pick on a state,\u201d said Tom Pelton, EIP director of communications.\n\nHe said the argument that the EPA worried about enforcement was disingenuous.\n\n\u201cIf they are going to be interested in enforcement, that would be a first for them because they've seen a significant decline in enforcement under the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nHe said the numbers showed the EPA\u2019s sharp focus on California was unwarranted.\n\n\u201cIt appears to be an improper political weaponizing of the EPA's enforcement authority. EPA should be using science and data to guide its enforcement actions, and there is zero science that backs up homeless pollution as a problem. And it\u2019s wrong to use ePA in this way.\u201d\n\nThe former EPA employees in their letter echoed similar criticisms.\n\n\u201cMr. Wheeler\u2019s actions cannot be treated as legitimate uses of EPA\u2019s authority taken for the purpose of advancing environmental protection, especially considering the current Administration\u2019s record. EPA has not shown much enthusiasm for enforcing environmental laws since President Trump took office, particularly when violations come from big polluters with political connections,\u201d read the letter.", "description": "Nearly 600 former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) officials are asking House leadership to investigate the\u00a0agency for appearing to place undue focus on California\u2019s pollution enforcement, an act they argu", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/sanfrancisco_060418getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
