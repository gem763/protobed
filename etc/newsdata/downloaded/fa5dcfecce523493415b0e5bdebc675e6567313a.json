USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Facing criticism from fellow Republicans as well as Democrats, President Donald Trump defended his withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria on Tuesday by claiming he is not selling out Kurdish allies.\n\n\"We may be in the process of leaving Syria, but in no way have we Abandoned the Kurds, who are special people and wonderful fighters,\" Trump said in an early morning string of tweets.\n\nCongressional lawmakers said Trump is doing exactly that by allowing Turkey to invade northern Syria and possibly crush U.S-supported Kurds who have helped combat Islamic State extremists.\n\nIn his tweets, Trump echoed a threat he made Monday to \"destroy\" Turkey's economy if it takes bad actions against the Kurds. He also defended Turkey, calling it \"a NATO and Trading partner\" with whom the United States has a \"very good\" relationship.\n\nAs the region braced for fighting between Turks and Kurds, officials in Turkey dismissed Trump's threats.\n\nPat Robertson: Trump could risk 'losing the mandate of heaven' with Syria decision\n\nTurkey Vice President Fuat Oktay, saying his country wants to create a zone to permit the resettlement of Syrian refugees, told reporters that \"where Turkey's security is concerned, we determine our own path but we set our own limits.\"\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, meanwhile, said in a statement that \"we will not hesitate for a moment in defending our people\" against Turkish troops.\n\nIn the United States, officials said Trump's withdrawal will trigger more fighting, pleasing Turkey, Russia, Iran and others who have their own designs for Syria.\n\n\"A precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., referring to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nDefending his decision, Trump noted that he campaigned for the presidency on a pledge to end wars in places like Syria.\n\nSyria: 4 reasons critics decry Trump's 'impulsive' Syria withdrawal\n\nHe also tweeted that \"we are helping the Kurds financially/weapons!\"\n\nThe White House announced late Sunday that \"Turkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria.
