However, profits reversed in 2018-19 and the group said in March it would part company with V\u00e9ronique Laury, who had been its CEO since 2014.\n\nBot, also a former CFO of Irish airline Aer Lingus, will receive a basic salary of 565,000 pounds ($689,526) and a pension allowance of 12.5% of salary. He will also be eligible to participate in Kingfisher\u2019s annual bonus scheme, long term incentive scheme and share award.\n\nThe group also said that John Wartig, who joined as interim CFO in April, has been appointed to the newly created role of chief transformation and development officer.", "description": "British home improvement group Kingfisher completed the line up of its top management with the appointment of Bernard Bot as its new finance chief on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
