Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, who won Pulitzers for their investigation exposing the multiple allegations of sexual assault against Weinstein, joined the podcast to share discoveries revealed in their just-published book about the case, She Said.\n\nWednesday\u2019s episode of The Daily centered on the previously reported memo that Bloom, working as a legal adviser to Weinstein at the time allegations against him began to be made public, sent the mega-producer to outline her suggested strategies for discrediting accuser Rose McGowan. Bloom, who has since said that she\u2019s \u201cmortified\u201d about having worked with Weinstein, has been accused of using her background representing women in high-profile sexual harassment lawsuits to undermine the allegations against the Hollywood figure.\n\nLisa Bloom's memo detailed plans to discredit Weinstein's accusers and rehabilitate his image.

Allred \u2014 who is famed for her work in lawsuits involving charges of sexual discrimination, harassment and misconduct, including cases against R. Kelly and Bill Cosby \u2014 is representing two of Weinstein\u2019s accusers ahead of the media mogul\u2019s trial next January.\n\nIn 2017, Allred issued a statement which declined to explicitly pass judgment on her daughter for representing Weinstein but insisted that she personally would have turned down his case. \u201cI only represent those who allege that they are victims of sexual harassment,\u201d she noted.\n\nAccording to Kantor and Twohey, however, there is more to the story. In 2004, Ashley Anderson \u2014 who now uses the name Ashley Matthau since her marriage to director Charles Matthau, son of the late actor Walter Matthau \u2014 accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting her on the set of Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights. Working as a dancer on the 2004 film, Matthau says she was approached by Weinstein about opportunities in Hollywood and claims that during a meeting in his hotel room, he masturbated on top of her.\n\nAshley Anderson Matthau, with husband Charles Matthau in 2012, says she settled a claim of sexual assault against Weinstein in 2004.
