Police say he confessed to the Aug. 3 mass shooting and that he carried out the attack targeting Mexicans.\n\nSome two-dozen people survived the attack with injuries; Hospital officials say two victims are still in the hospital.\n\nLocal prosecutors say they will seek the death penalty. Federal authorities are also considering capital murder charges and are investigating possible hate crimes charges. The Department of Justice has called the shooting an act of domestic terrorism.\n\nThere were 2,000 witnesses at the scene of the massacre, so almost everybody in the city of about 700,000 knew somebody affected by the shooting.\n\nThe first judge assigned the case recused himself, because he knew one of the people killed in the attack. The lead prosecutor says his sister was in the Walmart during the attack and that the gunman walked right by her.\n\nCrusius turned himself in less than an hour after the shooting after fleeing the scene in his car, according to police. His arrest warrant says he turned himself in, saying \"I'm the shooter.\" Police say he published a racist screed a few minutes before the shooting, saying he wanted to kill Latinos to balkanize the U.S. along racial lines.\n\nCrusius has been held without bond in an El Paso jail. He's been on a suicide watch since shortly after his arrest and is separated him from other prisoners.\n\nAnticipating a large crowd from the public, state District Court Judge Sam Medrano will hold the hearing in the county's largest courtroom, which seats 100. He said Wednesday that members of the public to should arrive an hour ahead of the 2 p.m. hearing for a security screening. Security will be heightened, according to a spokeswoman at the sheriff's department, which operates both the court and the jail.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
