After the leading crypto asset by market cap touched its bear market bottom at $3,200 the asset went parabolic until it topped out at $14,000 \u2013 just shy of setting a new all-time high.\n\nAfter consolidating in a symmetrical triangle for three months, Bitcoin\u2019s bullish trend has reversed, and according to a crypto analyst, a downtrend is now in full swing, and any bounces in price to higher levels are opportunities for a profitable short position entry.\n\nBitcoin Downtrend In Full Swing, Short Each Bounce\n\nThe consensus amongst crypto analysts throughout much of 2019 was that Bitcoin was well along its way into a new bull market, and that any dips were opportunities for buying or opening a long trade position.\n\nRelated Reading | Three Black Crows: Bitcoin Monthly Chart Forms Ominous Reversal Pattern\n\nA significant dip finally arrived after Bitcoin was rejected from $14,000, but buyers couldn\u2019t muster up enough buying force to sustain Bitcoin price above $10,000, and eventually, the multi-month triangle broke down, potentially causing a bearish reversal.\n\nOne crypto analyst, known for using unorthodox Renko candle charting, says that Bitcoin has indeed reversed and is now in a downtrend, and that buy the dip season has now turned back into an opportunity to short each bounce for profits.\n\n$BTC Daily Renko.

With what most believed to have been a bull market now put on pause, the market is now calling for new lows.\n\nPart of the reason for Bitcoin\u2019s parabolic rise in 2019, was due to crypto investors buying the crypto asset following what they had believed to be the bottom being put in. But as Bitcoin price begins a new downtrend, the December 2018 low of $3,100 potentially not being the bottom is now a realistic scenario that must be considered.\n\nRelated Reading | Crypto Market Death Cross Inches Closer, Will The Bear Market Return?\n\nThe thought has brought real fear back into the crypto market \u2013 a market that only a few short weeks ago was calling for Lambos and trips to the moon once again.
