REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/File Photo\n\nBritain is due to leave the EU on Oct. 31, but has yet to agree a divorce settlement with the bloc.\n\nBrussels has said that if there is a no-deal Brexit, investment firms in the EU must trade about 6,200 euro-denominated shares in the bloc; many are currently heavily traded in London.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore easy to conclude that for those shares, market liquidity would be damaged to no good end,\u201d Financial Conduct Authority Chief Executive Andrew Bailey said in a speech at Bloomberg.\n\nThe FCA will decide soon how to reciprocate on share trading, and Brussels has urged the watchdog not to require UK firms to trade euro shares in Britain as this would create an overlap that fragments trading.\n\nBailey said the best solution would be for Brussels to grant so-called temporary equivalence, or allow cross border share trading to continue in the event of a no-deal Brexit, as it has already done with derivatives clearing.\n\n\u201cThe EU have said to date they will not do that,\u201d he added.\n\nEquivalence is the main form of EU financial market access for non-member state countries. Brussels decides whether a foreign firm\u2019s rules are aligned enough with those in the bloc.\n\n\u201cWe stand ready to enter into dialogue with our European counterparts before we finalise our approach,\u201d Bailey said.\n\nBrussels has granted temporary equivalence for derivatives clearing so that EU customers could continue using clearing houses in London, but only until March 2020 if there is a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThis reflected Britain\u2019s original plan to leave the EU in March, and Bailey said Brussels would need to grant an extension soon to avoid costly disruption in markets.\n\nWithout an extension, clearing houses in Britain like the London Stock Exchange\u2019s LCH may have to tell EU customers by December to begin closing or moving derivatives positions from Britain by the end of March.\n\n\u201cUltimately, the best solution is for the EU to grant permanent recognition to UK CCPs (clearing houses),\u201d Bailey said.\n\nThe EU is keen to build up its own capital market capacity for trading and clearing to avoid relying on London after Brexit and has made it clear that granting permanent equivalence would not be automatic.\n\nBailey said British rules would be identical to those in the bloc on day one of Brexit, meaning equivalence should not be an issue.\n\nBritain, however, must not end up being a \u201ctaker\u201d of EU rules, or having to copy the bloc\u2019s regulation after Brexit for years to come to maintain EU access, he said.", "description": "Overlapping British and European Union share trading rules would damage markets \"to no good end\" and can be avoided if the bloc is more accommodative, Britain's top markets watchdog said on Monday.", "authors": ["Huw Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430381988&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0G6", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
