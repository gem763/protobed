And this scourge has no barriers.\n\nThe boxing champ\n\nBoxing champion Leighandre \u201cBaby Lee\u201d Jegels was murdered by her boyfriend on Friday.\n\nHe was a police officer. There were tell-tale signs of a relationship that was in trouble and Jegels had reportedly taken out a protection order against him.\n\nShe was only 25 and just getting started in her successful boxing career.\n\nShe had an unbeaten record of 9-0 with seven knockouts to her name.\n\nBut she was no match for bullets.\n\nThe student\n\nOn Monday, we learnt that missing University of Cape Town student Uyinene Mrwetyana was murdered, allegedly by a Post Office employee who had lured her back to the Post Office with the promise of a parcel she was expecting.\n\nHe was arrested on charges of rape and murder, and confessed to the crime.\n\nMrwetyana was just 19, with hopes of pursuing a career in the film and media space.\n\nThe family\n\nTwo weeks ago I attended the launch of a book titled Femicide, written by South African Human Rights Commissioner Angie Makwetla.\n\nHer family has lost two members to intimate partner violence, and the book is a sobering account of what the family have had to endure over the years.\n\nThe norm\n\nWith South Africa\u2019s Constitution billed as one of the most progressive in the world, why then do we still read about acts of violence, murder and rape as if it is an everyday occurrence?\n\nWhy is the safety and dignity of women and girls a topic discussed at dinner tables and family gatherings, where we are warned not to stay out too late.\n\nIt has become the norm, an everyday occurrence, something that has prompted this very piece of writing.\n\nSouth Africa has been labelled the \u201crape capital of the world\u201d following a crude estimate by figures obtained by Statistics South Africa and the 2016/17 South African Police Service statistics, which say that out of 100 000 women, 138 are raped in South Africa.\n\nWhile numbers can only begin to quantify the extent of violence which occurs in our society, it\u2019s the lived experiences and secondary trauma of survivors that bring the scariest stories to life.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa heard a few of these in November last year during the Presidential Summit on Gender Based Violence and Femicide in Centurion.\n\nRead: \u2018I\u2019m deeply hurt,\u2019 says Ramaphosa, after hearing painful stories of abuse\n\nAfter he listened to harrowing and shocking testimony delivered by women from various walks of life about their personal accounts of abuse and rape, Ramaphosa said that he was ashamed and \u201cdeeply hurt\u201d by what he had heard.\n\n\u201cIt is a moment that has filled me with sadness and shame as a man in South Africa,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his official Women\u2019s Day address this year, Ramaphosa announced that a gender-based violence steering committee would begin provincial consultations on the national strategy plan to end gender based violence.\n\nRead: Ramaphosa acknowledges gender-based violence on Women\u2019s Day\n\n\u201cThe department of justice is in the process of amending the national policy framework on the management of sexual offences. We are reviewing the Domestic Violence Act to strengthen its provisions around domestic homicide and the enforcement of protection orders,\u201d he said.\n\nBut is it enough? And is it happening quickly enough?\n\nIn March, during a dialogue in Tshwane on gender-based violence, a startling statement was made by Gauteng member of the executive council for community safety, Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane.\n\nGauteng recorded an unimaginable number of sexual offence cases in 2018 \u2013 10 116.\n\nAnd this number is only the reported cases, the ones where victims had the courage, either by themselves or with the support of community members and family, to report their abuser to the authorities.\n\nMany victims remain silent out of fear of stigmatisation or sometimes death.\n\nThis Sunday City Press ran an editorial expressing the team\u2019s disgust at the attacks on the female body following a picture spread of a lesbian couple.\n\nEditorial: The othering and hatred must stop\n\nYou may think that being eye-raped by a taxi driver in peak traffic is nothing compared with what the other women in this article have experienced.\n\nYet at the core of it is the same thing \u2013 disrespect.\n\nAnd its consequences are monumental.\n\nWomen don\u2019t feel safe. We have to think twice about what we wear, where we go and in whose company we are.\n\nHow did it get this bad? Where has South African society gone so wrong that many men objectify women to the point that abuse, rape and death can be meted out so easily?\n\nWhere is the respect of our bodies and our minds?\n\nWe can\u2019t and won\u2019t confine ourselves to the walls of our living spaces for fear of going out and being attacked, but we arm ourselves silently with the notion that we have to be vigilant and aware at all times.\n\nThat is the reality that we live in.", "description": "With South Africa\u2019s Constitution billed as one of the most progressive in the world, why do we still read about acts of violence, murder and rape as if it is an everyday occurrence?", "authors": ["Avantika Seeth"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4129/a9f7484dbfa24cd3b9af6d387c0be8c6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-03"}
