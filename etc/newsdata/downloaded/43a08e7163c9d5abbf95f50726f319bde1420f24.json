We, too, love money more than freedom and democracy. Xi doesn\u2019t look just like Winnie the Pooh at all. Tune into our 300th episode this Wednesday at 10! Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn\u2019s sorghum harvest be bountiful! We good now, China?\u201d\n\nThe satirical tweet comes on the heels of reports that China took action against the show after last week\u2019s episode took Hollywood to task for allowing China to censor all its movies, music, and TV shows.\n\nLast week\u2019s episode, \u201cBand in China,\u201d features jokes about China\u2019s crackdown on Winnie the Pooh, as well as skewering Hollywood for bending to censorship.\n\nIn the episode, Stan Marsh is approached by a Chinese film company when his heavy metal rock band begins turning heads. The Chinese filmmakers say that they think his group is the next big thing in music, and they want to make a biopic about the band\u2019s beginning. But soon, the kids find the Chinese overlords striking down their story, especially when it comes to describing the United States as a land of freedom.\n\n\u201cYou got to lower your ideals of freedom if you want to suck on the warm teat of China,\u201d the American director working for the Chinese film company tells Stan and his crew.\n\nWhen Stan complains about being forced to rewrite the story the kids are trying to tell, the director takes aim at Hollywood for allowing China to censor everything without complaints.\n\n\u201cCome on, guys,\u201d the film producer says to the boys. \u201cEveryone else is fine with China approving our entertainment. Even the PC Babies don\u2019t seem to mind. And PC Babies cry about everything!\u201d\n\nEventually, Stan quits the film because he can\u2019t stand the censorship.\n\nBut in the end, it appears that China was not amused and decided to quit South Park.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "The creators of South Park,\u00a0Trey Parker and Matt Stone, issued a fake apology to China Monday, after the communist country banned the Comedy Central show after its most recent episode called out the nation's censorship.", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/treyandmattmockchina1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
