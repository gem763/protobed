REUTERS/Sergio Perez\n\nMADRID (Reuters) - The leader of Spain\u2019s center-right Ciudadanos, Albert Rivera, on Monday unexpectedly made a proposal to get Spain out of political deadlock and avoid elections, saying he could facilitate Pedro Sanchez\u2019s investiture as premier under a number of conditions.\n\nSpanish politics have been in limbo since an inconclusive election in late April and had been all but certain to head to a repeat election.\n\nIt is not yet clear if Rivera\u2019s proposal will change that but he called on conservative party leader Pablo Casado to together propose a pact to Sanchez, that would include not increasing taxes and applying direct rule again in Catalonia if the regional government rejects an upcoming sentence in a separatist trial.\n\nThe third condition would be the Socialists not governing in the Navarra region with the support of far-left Basque nationalist party Bildu.\n\n\u201cWe offer a state solution for Spain: we will unblock the investiture if Sanchez accepts three conditions,\u201d his party tweeted him as saying.\n\nRivera gave a news conference in which he did not explicitly mention a possible abstention, but Spanish media including El Mundo newspaper said that was what he was considering.\n\nThe center-right leader had so far rejected giving any form of support or even an abstention and had not even showed up to a round of talks held by Sanchez with other party leaders.\n\nSanchez has until Sept. 23 to be voted in by parliament. If he is not, the country will head to elections.\n\n\u201cIf no one does anything we will waste (millions) in a repeat elections,\u201d Rivera said.", "description": "The leader of Spain's center-right Ciudadanos, Albert Rivera, on Monday unexpectedly made a proposal to get Spain out of political deadlock and avoid elections, saying he could facilitate Pedro Sanchez's investiture as premier under a number of conditions.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430412044&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0O5", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
