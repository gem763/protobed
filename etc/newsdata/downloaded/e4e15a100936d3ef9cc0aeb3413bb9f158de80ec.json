While many mainstream media reports have written of Mugabe\u2019s legacy in measured tones, his victims had a different story to tell.\n\nOne survivor told Breitbart London: \u201cMugabe\u2019s legacy? He doesn\u2019t have a legacy. What other people see as a legacy, I see as brutality\u2026 my father was murdered by his regime in 1983\u2026 I didn\u2019t go to school because of him.\n\n\u201cI was tortured in 2001 [at the] police station\u2026 they came and dispersed everyone with police dogs and batons, beating everyone up. I was locked up for six hours at the police station, hung by one leg from the roof, put inside a drum, beaten\u2026 I didn\u2019t know whether I was going to survive.\u201d\n\nZimbabwe'e brutal former leader Robert Mugabe, who turned his rich and fertile country from the breadbasket of Africa to a total basket case in one generation, has died https://t.co/8yL4xB1My5 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 6, 2019\n\nAnother said while Mugabe had left a legacy, it was not a positive one, remarking: \u201cwe are now fighting to destroy his legacy that he left with the Zanu-PF [Mugabe\u2019s political party]\u2026 the legacy of torture, intimidation, killing people, abducting.\u201d\n\nMugabe\u2019s legacy was also economic. During his brutal reign, the land went from being the richest and most productive country in Africa to one of the poorest, suffering massive hyperinflation and total collapse of basic services and unemployment. On the reasons for the former British colony and the \u2018breadbasket of Africa\u2019 Rhodesia having become the basket case of Zimbabwe, one demonstrator told Breitbart:\n\n\u201c\u2026my aunties, my nephews, I lost a lot of my family members through the butchering of the Ndebele\u2026 there is no money, there is no employment. There is no electricity, there is no water.\n\n\u201cI do blame Mugabe for that because he\u2019s the one who drove all the white farmers out of the country. If it wasn\u2019t for him, we would be in a better state by now.\u201d\n\nDespite the atrocities visited upon his own people, Mugabe never faced justice for his actions and, thanks to a global network of supporters and massive embezzlement of his country\u2019s wealth, was able to die in comfort. For that reason, he died too soon, one said, remarking: \u201cSome people are rejoicing he\u2019s dead. For me, I\u2019m sad because I wanted him to live so he could face [justice for] his criminal activities\u2026 we didn\u2019t want him to die yet.\u201d", "description": "\"There is no electricity, there is no water.
