The men said they didn\u2019t \u201cfuck with politics\u201d and left, calling for world peace as they did.\n\nStewart was criticised for being out of touch after he recalled the incident at an event this week, saying: \u201cOne thing about social media is that it allows people to see politicians listening \u2026 I can go to Brick Lane and three sort of minor gangsters can come up to me and spend a minute telling me I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d\n\nLilo Blues, one of the musicians, spoke to the Guardian shortly after finishing a driving lesson in Dublin on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s just another example of another weirdo white man trying to take advantage of black boys when it\u2019s convenient, then ridiculing them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat guy needs to apologise. He wants to seem like the people\u2019s man, mixing with people from diverse backgrounds, but he\u2019s chasing clout and now he\u2019s trying to chat shit about us. I\u2019m not letting this guy tarnish our name, especially given the positive message we try to push in our music.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a gangster, I\u2019m not pretending to be and I\u2019m not going to let some corny, goofy-looking man say I am. We\u2019re all about peace and love, and he calls us gangsters. It was definitely racist.\u201d\n\nOf the encounter, he said: \u201cI saw this opportunistic white man from a distance has noticed us three black lads and he\u2019s, like, getting really giddy and tells his camera, \u2018Lets go\u2019 \u2026 and then there\u2019s the awkward conversation. Then he goes, \u2018OK I\u2019m a politician,\u2019 so I was like, \u2018Nice to meet you but I\u2019m off to get some Nandos\u2019.\u201d\n\nHis bandmate, Tony Konstone, whose parents moved from Egypt to Dublin when he was two, said: \u201cThe irony he\u2019s running for mayor of London. He judged us off about 15 seconds. He didn\u2019t even have a decent conversation with us.\u201d\n\nKonstone previously told the Guardian that selling drugs for a living was common where he grew up, particularly as there were lots of students, but he took another path. \u201cWe do what we do, and he\u2019s not going to make us seem like that. To go off and make remarks after meeting us without any research is low and ignorant.\u201d\n\nHare Squead have almost 1 million listeners a month on Spotify. They have been signed to a major label and toured with Nas, Joey Bada$$ and Dua Lipa. They play infectiously catchy, feel-good soulful music which fuses rap, pop, R&B, electronics and trap, and have a new single, Meeting with Myself, out on 5 November, which is about being self-aware and staying focused.\n\nRory Stewart (@RoryStewartUK) You can\u2019t win \u2018em all... Brick Lane #RoryWalks pic.twitter.com/mAFSQuZuGp\n\nOn Friday, Labour\u2019s three most senior black female MPs accused Stewart of racism and bias.\n\n\u201cThis is racism,\u201d the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, tweeted. \u201cAnd it is completely shameful. Especially when it comes from someone running to be the mayor of our diverse and multicultural capital city.\u201d\n\nThe shadow minister for women and equalities, Dawn Butler, said his remark was an example of biased association brought about by the media\u2019s \u201cobsession\u201d with \u201cassociating black men with gangs\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is clear racial bias because they are black men and it perpetuates negative associations of them,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cAlso, what the hell is a minor gangster?!\u201d\n\nMarsha de Cordova, the shadow minister for disabled people, said: \u201cThis baseless negative stereotyping of Londoners based on nothing other than the way they look is completely unacceptable and flies in the face of our city\u2019s values.\n\n\u201cRory Stewart should immediately withdraw these comments and apologise.\u201d\n\nAs the row showed no signs of dying down on Friday, Stewart may reflect that his walks have been more trouble than they are worth. Sadiq Khan ridiculed them earlier this month with a reference to Stewart\u2019s previous adventures striding across Afghanistan, saying: \u201cI walk all the time. What I don\u2019t do is walk around London with an iPhone filming my walk. And what I don\u2019t do is treat Londoners like natives. We aren\u2019t natives.\u201d", "description": "Hare Squead rappers accuse politician of racism and \u2018trying to take advantage of black boys\u2019", "authors": ["Mattha Busby", "Kate Proctor", "Rory Stewart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ca369ae77c314ca862d47971660f7ef1c98ea45/740_739_4876_2926/master/4876.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=931fe3a1f17a787698e05509fa0795e7", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
