The project \u2015 about Miles \u201cPudge\u201d Halter, a reserved Florida teen who experiences love and loss when he falls for the enigmatic Alaska while attending an Alabama boarding school in 2005 \u2015 would round out a trio of screen reimaginings of Green\u2019s work, which included 2014\u2032s \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars\u201d and 2015\u2032s \u201cPaper Towns.\u201d\n\nAlaska is a character who, on paper, appears one-dimensional. But that\u2019s just what the author intends. The entire book is told through Miles\u2019 point of view in an effort to comment on \u201cthe catastrophically limited male gaze,\u201d according to Green. It\u2019s why he has his protagonist describe the mysterious, intellectual, third-wave feminist as \u201cnot just beautiful, but hot, too, with her breasts straining against her tight tank top, her curved legs swinging back and forth beneath the swing, flip-flops dangling from her electric-blue-painted toes.\u201d\n\nSo how would Alaska not just become another on-screen Manic Pixie Dream Girl? Luckily, a film script by \u201cThe O.C.\u201d creator Josh Schwartz, previously set to be helmed by director Rebecca Thomas, attempted to give Alaska her due.\n\nFroseth told HuffPost that Thomas initially reached out to her about the role, finding her through a modeling agency. The director helped the newcomer with audition tapes and even had Froseth do a chemistry read with British actor Charlie Rowe, who, at the time, was up for the part of Miles.\n\nBut then development plans were quashed.\n\n\u201cIt was really heartbreaking because this was my first time ever getting into the acting world, and to do that with this character and story was incredibly special,\u201d Froseth told us over the phone. \u201cI moved a lot from New Jersey to Norway \u2015 to different cultures and different languages. I really struggled with finding my people, or just finding out who I was. So with Alaska, I just related to how she protected herself in that way.\u201d\n\nFroseth, who was discovered at a mall in Oslo before her family moved back to the United States, ended up booking a slew of roles while \u201cLooking for Alaska\u201d was in limbo, including Netflix Original movies \u201cSierra Burgess is a Loser\u201d and \u201cApostle,\u201d and the series \u201cThe Society.\u201d\n\nAt 21, her star was rising when she received news that the gig of her dreams was once again up for grabs. This time, \u201cLooking for Alaska\u201d was greenlighted as an eight-part miniseries on Hulu, run by Schwartz and his creative partner, Stephanie Savage, known for \u201cGossip Girl\u201d and Marvel\u2019s \u201cRunaways.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight away, I was like, \u2018I need to get in the room with Josh and Stephanie,\u2019\u201d Froseth said.\n\nAnd so she did.\n\nAlfonso Bresciani Looking For Alaska -- \"Famous Last Words\" - Episode 101 -- Miles Halter, seeking a more than minor life, enrolls at Culver Creek Academy. On his first day, he gets a new nickname, a best friend, some enemies and makes a deal with Alaska Young that will change his life forever. Alaska (Kristine Froseth), shown.\n\nAt this point, Froseth had read \u201cLooking for Alaska\u201d almost a dozen times and discovered a new takeaway each go-around. She was ready to play this role, especially since Savage and Schwartz now had eight hours of TV in which they could fully ditch the male perspective.\n\nTheir story showcases a well-rounded young woman whose personal thoughts and emotions cater to the overall theme, which centers on an unexpected tragedy. The other characters \u2015 Miles (Charlie Plummer), Chip \u201cThe Colonel\u201d Martin (Denny Love) and Takumi Hikoito (Jay Lee) \u2015 still come to life, but with the showrunners\u2019 additions, viewers better understand Alaska\u2019s vulnerability through her solitary moments or in scenes with her college-age boyfriend, Jake (Henry Zaga).\n\nFroseth truly encapsulates the complex aura of Alaska \u2015 a seemingly put-together teenage girl who tries to hide the painful anxieties she faces every day. It\u2019s a part worth the wait.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been great not only to get \u2018the girl next door\u2019 roles,\u201d Froseth said. \u201cWhen I first started, it was mostly the guy\u2019s story and the girl kind of being there to help him through his journey. But now, I\u2019m getting very well fleshed out, complex characters that aren\u2019t just described as \u2018beautiful\u2019 or \u2018smart,\u2019\u201d she chuckled, adding, \u201cI just hope that keeps going.\u201d\n\nPhillip Faraone via Getty Images Denny Love, Kristine Froseth, Charlie Plummer, Jay Lee, and Josh Schwartz of \"Looking for Alaska\" attend the Hulu 2019 Summer TCA Press Tour at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on July 26, 2019 in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nIt\u2019s not lost on Froseth the impact of movements like Time\u2019s Up and Me Too have had on the industry, in terms of enhancing the experience of women in Hollywood. Froseth said that in the five years since she began working as an actor, she\u2019s seen a change in the ratio of female to male directors, as well as an uptick in women-centered projects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just really incredible to see that the conversation is being taken seriously, as it should be,\u201d she said of gender equality. Froseth also has noticed a lot more collaboration between producers and actors, something she respects as a young actor.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to not feel like you\u2019re just a puppet,\u201d Froseth added, \u201cthat they want you to be part of the process and they cast you for reason. Just to feel that trust is incredible. There\u2019s so many different opinions, and it\u2019s really great when we all kind of mix it into one pot and cook it together.\u201d\n\nAs for her own career trajectory, Froseth looks to Marion Cotillard and Robert Pattinson for inspiration \u2015 actors who appear to put their all into the craft.\n\n\u201cAnd obviously if I could ever get on some Joaquin Phoenix-level that would be pretty incredible,\u201d she concluded. \u201cThey care about what they do. I just want to keep feeling that because it\u2019s so important.\u201d\n\n\u201cLooking For Alaska\u201d is now streaming on Hulu.", "description": "At 23, the budding actor doesn't want to be treated as a \"puppet\" in the entertainment industry.", "authors": ["Senior Entertainment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daa1180200000f313506214.jpeg?cache=9zkwc4r7ky&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
