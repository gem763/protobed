For hundreds of thousands of others, who were yet to travel with the company, the only remaining option is to claim their money back.\n\nBut for Thomas Cook\u2019s 21,000 employees, the end of the line for Britain\u2019s oldest travel firm means something much worse: the loss of their jobs. That is usually the outcome of the type of the insolvency procedure used to wind up the company \u2013 a compulsory liquidation.\n\n\u201cGenerally on a compulsory liquidation, with some exceptions, staff unfortunately lose their jobs as the business quickly ceases trading,\u201d explains Emma Shipp, partner at law firm Hewitsons.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Claims are paid within 14 days on average, although the service plans to pay sooner \u201cif practicable\u201d, it says.\n\nHowever, the payments are subject to certain limits and so may not be paid in full, points out Ms Shipp.\n\n\u201cSay, if you\u2019ve got a very highly paid pilot, they may not get back in full what they\u2019re owed,\u201d she notes.\n\nThomas Cook had been in talks with Chinese conglomerate Fosun over a capital injection and break-up of the firm that would ensure its survival. But the rescue plan collapsed when Thomas Cook was unable to find an additional \u00a3200m demanded by its banks as part of the deal.\n\n\u201cFosun confirms that its position remained unchanged throughout the process, but unfortunately other factors have changed. We extend our deepest sympathy to all those affected by this outcome,\u201d the Chinese company said.", "description": "The collapse of Thomas Cook has left over 150,000 UK holidaymakers currently abroad facing a premature end to their holiday.
