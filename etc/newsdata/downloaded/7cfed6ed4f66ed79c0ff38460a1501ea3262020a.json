Here\u2019s why you should go now \u2013 before the rest of the world catches on.\n\nIt\u2019s Asia\u2019s mountain-climbing hotspot\u2026\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nMost weekends, Taiwanese people head for the hills \u2013 and who can blame them? Over 70 per cent of the island is mountainous: from small-scale fells topped with lush forests, to mighty peaks where only experienced hikers should tread. Yushan (Jade Mountain) often steals the limelight: at 3,952m, it\u2019s the island\u2019s loftiest \u2013 and climbing it is considered a rite of passage for many local people.\n\nBut Xueshan \u2013 Snow Mountain \u2013 is arguably more spectacular, with a trail that traverses bamboo groves, razor-edged cliffs and wildflower-strewn pastures. It\u2019s a two-day hoof to the 3,886m summit: you\u2019ll get there just before dawn, in time to see the golden sunrise spill over Taiwan\u2019s saw-toothed highlands. You\u2019ll need a good guide: Taiwan Adventures is highly recommended, and takes care of all hiking permits and meal arrangements.\n\n\u2026And the day hikes are pretty spectacular too\n\nYou don\u2019t need thighs of steel to see Taiwan\u2019s natural beauty writ large. The forested hills around the capital are ideal for refreshing yomps and sparkling city views, while the trails through Wuling National Forest lead to waterfalls, cherry blossom groves, and thickly tangled jungle \u2013 where wild monkeys hoot in the treetops. Taiwan Adventure Outings offers intrepid day hikes for all abilities.\n\nAlternatively, venture to Taroko Gorge to tackle the Zhuilu Old Trail: a three-hour walk that crosses rope bridges and untamed rainforest before emerging onto one of the world\u2019s most jaw-dropping pathways. Hand-chiselled into a smooth cliff-face, with a 1,100m drop just a misplaced step away, the trail is just 50cm wide in some places \u2013 but the views will (almost) take your mind off the fright. Below, the Liwu River thunders tirelessly, while the mountains soar up, up, into the clouds.\n\nYou can cycle around the entire island\n\nYou\u2019ll cover some serious ground on the Taiwan Cycle Route No1. It circumnavigates the island \u2013 taking in beaches, forests and cities \u2013 on a mix of dedicated bike tracks and main roads with cycle lanes. The 968km trail takes 10-12 days to complete, but can easily stretch to three weeks with plentiful sightseeing and rest days.\n\nTight on time? The trail between Hualien and Taitung \u2013 also known as Highway 11 \u2013 is a three-day coastal jaunt that\u2019s suitable for beginners. There are beaches to explore, villages to rest in and opportunities for hiking and surfing along the way. Happily, Taitung is the hot springs capital of Taiwan: your legs will thank you for a soothing soak at the trail\u2019s end.\n\nThe street food is seriously good\n\nEvery Taiwanese city has (at least) one road or market dedicated entirely to street food \u2013 its stalls sizzling with barbecue pork, beef noodle soup and seafood skewers. The food is fresh, authentic and ideal for nibbling while people-watching. Every now and again you\u2019ll catch a whiff of something ghastly: that\u2019s just \u201cstinky tofu\u201d, a fermented local speciality. Take a bite: it\u2019s surprisingly innocuous, with a sweet flavour and crispy deep-fried crust.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty for pud, too: think pancakes stuffed with peanuts and ice cream; pineapple cake; and mountains of sweet shaved ice topped with fresh mango.\n\nIt\u2019s a tea lover\u2019s paradise\n\nMaokong, in the mountains just south of Taipei, is a tea-growing hotspot \u2013 its hills a patchwork of family-owned plantations, dotted with cosy wooden teahouse cafes. Most have outdoor terraces overlooking the valley, for the ultimate brew-with-a-view. Take a seat (each table has its own kettle) and order a pot of tieguanyin or baozhong: both are local specialities, renowned for their flowery fragrance and deep jade colour.\n\nMaokong is best reached by gondola from Taipei. It\u2019s a half-hour journey up into the hills, swooping up over tiny rural villages and plunging valleys \u2013 made all-the-more thrilling by the cable car\u2019s glass floor.\n\nIt\u2019s great for grown-up backpackers\n\nWant to re-live the freedom of your first backpacking adventure \u2013 but without the sketchy bunk beds and sweaty bus journeys? Taiwan\u2019s hostels are clean and quirky, while the island\u2019s diminutive size and excellent public transport network makes getting around a cinch.\n\nWith their street-art-style murals, contemporary furniture and creative crowds, Taiwan\u2019s hostels set the bar for budget digs. Indeed, when you\u2019re making new friends over happy hour beers and paying just NT$1,000 (\u00a325) per night for a private double room, you\u2019ll wonder why you ever swapped hostels for hotels. Lazy House Hostel in Hualien and NK Hostel in Taipei are particularly high quality.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Instead, venture south to Kenting National Park, for secluded soft-sand beaches and coves the colour of swimming pools. Highlights include Baisha Beach (for tranquil water and handy facilities) and Little Bali Bay (for snorkelling).\n\nIn the island\u2019s oft-overlooked north, head to Baishawan or Fulong: up here, the sand is the colour and texture of demerara sugar. Both are an easy drive from Taipei, and Fulong hosts the annual International Sand Sculpting Art Festival (April-August) \u2013 where you\u2019ll spy some seriously impressive sandcastles.\n\nYou\u2019ve definitely underestimated Taipei\n\nYes, it\u2019s one of Asia\u2019s top financial hubs, but there\u2019s much more to Taipei than banks and office blocks. This minded city is stuffed with art galleries, cool bars, dumpling stalls and street markets. Check out Four Four South Village Simple Market (Songqin Street) for vintage threads and hand-made jewellery; and The Red House (Chengdu Road) for contemporary art prints and craft beer.\n\nTo get your bearings, head to Taipei 101\u2019s observation deck: until 2010, this ornate glass \u2019scraper was the world\u2019s tallest building. You can gaze out across downtown Taipei and over to the mountains beyond \u2013 but, for the best city views, you\u2019ll need to lace up your trainers instead. From the summit of Elephant Mountain, a 40-minute hike from Xiangshan metro station, Taipei\u2019s bright centre unfurls at your feet. Come here at sunset to see the towers twinkling beneath the blushing sky.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get around\n\nModelled on Japan\u2019s Shinkansen \u201cBullet\u201d trains, Taiwan\u2019s high-speed rail network can whisk you from Taipei to Kaohsiung (almost the entire length of the country) in just 1 hour 45 minutes \u2013 all for around NT$1,490 (\u00a337). The \u201cregular\u201d train network is great too, serving all the big cities as well as further-flung towns.\n\nGetting around by scooter is cheap and popular (Taiwan drives on the right) \u2013 but the roads are often hectic and traffic etiquette is non-existent. If you do try it, make sure you\u2019re covered by insurance. A safer bet is hiring a car, though you\u2019ll need an International Driving Permit from the UK Post Office.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to blow your budget\n\nDon\u2019t expect to pay more than NT$2,010 (\u00a350) per night for a king-size room in a boutique hotel \u2013 and you can get a decent double for NT$1,200 (\u00a335) outside Taipei.\n\nWhile you could happily feast on street food for just a few dollars, restaurants are great value too \u2013 as long as you don\u2019t want linen tablecloths or silver service. In a modest family-run restaurant you\u2019ll pay around NT$140 (\u00a33.50) for a bowl of beef noodle soup, and NT$50 (\u00a31.25) for a bottle of Taiwan Beer.", "description": "Welcome to east Asia\u2019s best-kept secret: a bite-sized island with a vibrant foodie scene, hot springs by the bucket-load and a gloriously crowd-free coast that\u2019s ripe for exploring by bike.
