Planes and drones are still in action.\n\nExtending Sophia\u2019s mandate until March 31, EU headquarters said Thursday that \u201cthe deployment of the Operation\u2019s naval assets will remain temporarily suspended.\u201d\n\nAid groups are shocked by the seemingly absurd prospect of a naval operation without any boats and accuse the EU of abandoning people seeking refuge in Europe.\n\nWell over a million migrants entered Europe in 2015 but arrivals into Italy are now at their lowest levels for several years.\n\n___\n\n1:55 p.m.\n\nMalta\u2019s interior minister says that only Germany and France have maintained their commitment to take migrants under distribution pacts reached when the small EU nation permitted their disembarkation from humanitarian rescue ships.\n\nInterior Minister Michael Farrugia told Malta state TV on Thursday that half of the migrants remain in Malta, despite deals brokered through the EU. He urged the EU and other nations to fulfil their pledges. He said the delay in relocation is putting \u201cgreat pressure\u201d on the detention center where the migrants are held.\n\nOn Wednesday, migrants being kept in the center hung up banners demanding their release in a peaceful protest. The 800 migrants being held at the Hal Safi center include migrants rescued at sea by Maltese armed forces.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Latest on the influx of migrants into Europe (all times local):", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
