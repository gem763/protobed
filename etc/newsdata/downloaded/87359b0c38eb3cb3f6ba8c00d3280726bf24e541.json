These picked up by 5.4 percentage points to 69% in the third quarter - compared with a 2023 target of 75%.\n\nIn the third quarter, SAP reported a 10% increase in revenue and a 15% rise in operating profit, after adjusting one-off items and currencies, helping it to achieve an expansion of 1.7% in its operating margins.\n\nThe company reiterated its forecast for the year and through to 2023. SAP is due to update investors on strategy at a capital markets' day in New York on Nov. 12.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Douglas Busvine; Editing by Tassilo Hummel and Sherry Jacob-Phillips)", "description": "Business software group SAP said on Monday it had reached a three-year deal with Microsoft to help its large enterprise customers move their business processes into the cloud.
