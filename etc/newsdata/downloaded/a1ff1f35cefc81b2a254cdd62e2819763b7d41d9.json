After the race, Wallace approached Bowman, who was being treated on pit road by a medic for overheating, and splashed a drink in his face.\n\nBowman later said Wallace had been giving him the middle finger during the race and that he was \u201cjust over it,\u201d according to NBC Sports.\n\nBUBBA WALLACE GOT A TATTOO OF RICHARD PETTY'S FACE\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to stand up for myself at some point,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cProbably wouldn\u2019t have gotten wrecked if he had his finger back in the car \u2026 I\u2019d be mad too, but he put himself in that spot.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Steve O\u2019Donnell, NASCAR executive vice president and chief racing development officer, told SiriusXM NASCAR Radio he\u2019ll be addressing the issue with Wallace this week before the next race at Delaware\u2019s Dover International Speedway.\n\n\u201cThat was really not classy whatsoever,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cI understand that drivers have issues with each other during the race. We totally get that, but with drivers on the ground being tended to by medical personnel, you need to be smarter than that, and we\u2019ll have that conversation with Bubba and we\u2019ll see how that goes, obviously prior to Dover.\u201d\n\nBowman finished second at Charlotte, which was good enough for him to move on to the second round of the NASCAR playoffs, which Wallace failed to qualify for this year.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM", "description": "\"That was really not classy whatsoever.\"", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
