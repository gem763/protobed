-\n\nTrump criticised Schiff for his depiction of the call during a congressional hearing last week.\n\nSchiff opened the hearing with a parody imitation of Trump speaking like a mob boss to pressure Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.\n\n\"It bore NO relationship to what I said on the call,\" Trump tweeted of Schiff's remarks. \"Arrest for Treason?\"\n\nTrump also raised eyebrows by retweeting comments made by a Baptist pastor, Robert Jeffress, to Fox News warning of the dangers of \"civil war\" if the president was impeached.\n\n\"If the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal,\" Trump paraphrased Jeffress as saying.\n\nAn Australian government spokesman meanwhile confirmed that Trump asked Prime Minister Scott Morrison to help US Attorney General Bill Barr gather information for a probe into the Mueller inquiry.\n\nAustralia \"has always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation,\" the spokesman said in a statement.\n\n\"The PM confirmed this readiness once again in conversation with the President.\"\n\nThe Times said the White House restricted access to the transcript of the Trump-Morrison call in a manner similar to what was done with Trump's call with Zelensky.\n\nThe original FBI probe into Russian election meddling -- which was taken over by Mueller -- was launched after the bureau received a tip from Australian officials.\n\n- Voters split on impeachment -\n\nOne new poll out Monday suggested that Americans were split down the middle over whether they support impeachment of the 73-year-old real estate tycoon.\n\nIf Trump were impeached by a simple majority vote in the 435-member House, he would face a trial in the Republican-led Senate, where a two-thirds majority would be needed to convict and remove him from office.\n\nFew Republican lawmakers have criticized Trump since the Ukraine scandal emerged, but former Republican senator Jeff Flake urged them on Monday to speak up.\n\n\"Trust me when I say that you can go elsewhere for a job,\" Flake said. \"But you cannot go elsewhere for a soul.\"", "description": "President Donald Trump attacked the Democratic lawmaker spearheading the impeachment inquiry on Monday as congressional committees subpoenaed his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, for documents related to his dealings with Ukraine.
