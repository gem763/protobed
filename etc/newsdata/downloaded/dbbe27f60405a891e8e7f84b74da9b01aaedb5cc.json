Giuliani has been resisting that advice. \u2014 Shimon Prokupecz (@ShimonPro) October 15, 2019\n\nGiuliani\u2019s decision to part ways with Sale comes as he faces congressional subpoenas and the arrests of two of his colleagues who had been assisting him in his investigation into Hunter Biden.\n\nAs for the congressional subpoenas, Giuliani told ABC News that he won\u2019t be cooperating with any of the requests related to the impeachment inquiry. This would leave Giuliani acting in contempt of Congress, though he seemed unconcerned, telling ABC, \u201cIf they enforce it, then we will see what happens.\u201d\n\nGiuliani was asked to turn over any documentation related to his efforts in Ukraine with a deadline of Tuesday evening.\n\nAt the time, Giuliani responded by hinting that he didn\u2019t believe in the legitimacy of the impeachment inquiry itself.\n\nI have received a subpoena signed only by Democrat Chairs who have prejudged this case. It raises significant issues concerning legitimacy and constitutional and legal issues including,inter alia, attorney client and other privileges. It will be given appropriate consideration. \u2014 Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) September 30, 2019\n\nHe has also been asked by Sen. Lindsey Graham to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.", "description": "Rudy Giuliani has parted ways with his personal attorney after announcing that he does not plan to comply with congressional subpoenas.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/582be1e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2Faf%2F29%2F66eaa4954380874b287c78ac2cae%2Fap-17228114256145.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
