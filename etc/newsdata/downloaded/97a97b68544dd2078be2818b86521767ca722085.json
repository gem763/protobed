The plane again entered Kadiz later that day at around 12:25 a.m. before leaving at 1:08 p.m., spending a total of 77 minutes inside the area between the two intrusions.Yet in contrast to the 25 other times China trespassed into Kadiz without any warning this year, in this case Beijing informed Korea of the motive and trajectory of its jet\u2019s flight after Korean officials requested intelligence about unidentified aircraft, according to an official from Korea\u2019s JCS.This attitude change may be owed to a vice-ministerial strategic defense dialogue held between the two countries in Beijing last week, in which the two sides agreed to connect additional military hotlines between their militaries and enhance defense cooperation a step further.From Oct. 21 to 22, Korea\u2019s Vice Defense Minister Park Jae-min met with Lt. Gen. Shao Yuanming, deputy chief of the Joint Staff Department of China\u2019s Central Military Commission, and held discussions over a host of security issues in the region.The talks were the first time the two countries\u2019 defense officials held military discussions in five years after Beijing withdrew from dialogue as a result of Seoul\u2019s decision to deploy the American Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) anti-missile system on its soil in 2015.The two sides agreed to revise an existing memorandum of understanding in order to further add another military hotline between their navies and air forces, while a separate agreement was signed regarding cooperation in the event of natural disasters.Currently there is only a single hotline between Korea\u2019s Master Control and Report Center (MCRC) and China\u2019s Northern Theater Command to relay military communication between the two countries, but talks are underway to install an additional channel between a second MCRC base and China\u2019s Eastern Theater Command.An air defense identification zone (ADIZ) corresponds to the airspace that extends beyond a country\u2019s national territory where a country can interrogate unidentified aircraft and possibly intercept them in the event it detects a threat to its sovereign airspace.After China declared its own identification zone, Cadiz, in 2013, the number of unauthorized entries by Chinese planes into Kadiz has dramatically increased. Many analysts interpret these growing intrusions as a sign of China\u2019s attempt to expand its military influence in the region.BY SHIM KYU-SEOK [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
