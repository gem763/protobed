Predicting information pertaining to menstrual cycles is complex and dependent on thousands of variables.\n\n\"Our users are made aware of our Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy prior to signing up on Maya. Post sign up, our users can export their data and delete their account whenever they choose to.\"\n\nLinchpin Health did not respond to PI and MIA said it did not wish its response to be published.\n\nFacebook told the BBC: \"Our terms of service prohibit developers from sending us sensitive health information and we enforce against them when we learn they are.\n\n\"In addition, ad targeting based on people's interests does not leverage information gleaned from people's activity across other apps or websites.\"\n\nImage copyright PI Image caption The Maya app encourages users to enter their mood and this is then shared with Facebook, in this case \"Anxious\"\n\nThe BBC has contacted both companies but at the time of publishing had not received responses.\n\nPI believes its findings raise serious concerns as to how such apps are compliant with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation.\n\n\"The responsibility should be on the companies to comply with their legal obligations and live up to the trust that users have placed in them when deciding to use their service,\" PI concluded.\n\nFacebook has announced it will launch a tool for users to stop apps and businesses sharing their data with the social network.", "description": "Some period-tracking apps are sharing intimate details with Facebook, says Privacy International.", "authors": ["Jane Wakefield", "Technology Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9559/production/_108733283_periodcalendar.gif", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
