Instead it will cause you pain, discomfort, and infection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVanessa Mackay, consultant gynaecologist and spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists tells Metro.co.uk: \u2018It is a myth that toothpaste will tighten the vagina.\n\n\u2018Putting toothpaste into the vagina, or on the vulva, would not only be uncomfortable but it could also cause serious damage and disrupt the natural flora of the vagina leading to the potential for infections like bacterial vaginosis and thrush.\u2019\n\nToothpaste is often abrasive (think of all those scrubby bits you use to whiten your teeth) and can cause microabrasions within the vaginal walls, which again makes you more likely to develop an infection \u2013 as well as causing you pain.\n\nThe vagina doesn\u2019t need tightening (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nIf anything, the discomfort might make your vagina feel tighter, because your vagina relaxes when it\u2019s comfortable and you\u2019re turned on.\n\nThe technique highlights the lingering insecurities so many women have around their genitals.\n\nLoads of us feel our vaginas need to be tighter and that \u2018looseness\u2019 is a terrible, shameful thing, or a sign that we\u2019ve had lots of sexual partners. This simply isn\u2019t true. Having \u2018too much\u2019 sex cannot loosen the vagina, and tightness is not a prerequisite to having pleasurable sex. Sex is far more enjoyable when the vagina is relaxed and well-lubricated.\n\nOur difficulty openly chatting about vaginas and our body image means that those who are worried about tightness may resort to dangerous DIY treatments, such as the use of vinegar, toothpaste, or vagina tightening sticks, rather than talking to a doctor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you are concerned about the appearance or tightness of your vagina, speak to a professional about your concerns rather than trying any treatments that aren\u2019t backed by science.\n\nYou can also try pelvic floor exercises to help build the muscles in the vagina.\n\nVanessa says: \u2018Women who are concerned about the tightness of their vagina should contact their healthcare professional who will be able to assess them and offer guidance in terms of treatment options, one of which could be pelvic floor exercises.\n\n\u2018There are various different ways in which women can carry out pelvic floor exercises but the easiest is to sit or stand comfortably with knees slightly apart and then engage and draw up the pelvic floor muscles as if trying to avoid passing urine or flatus.\n\n\u2018To check that the correct muscles are being exercised, women can place a finger or thumb into the vagina and squeeze the pelvic floor muscles at the same time, they should feel a gentle squeeze as the muscles contract.\n\n\u2018Women can build up the strength of their pelvic floor muscles by doing ten slow contractions and holding them for about 10 seconds each. The length of time can be increased gradually and the slow contractions can then be followed by a set of quick contractions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This process should be carried out three or four times a day.\n\n\u2018In some women, however, vaginal laxity may be due to pelvic organ prolapse, in which case it may be appropriate to be referred to a gynaecologist for an expert opinion.\u2019\n\nMORE: What is a \u2018blind vagina\u2019?\n\nMORE: It\u2019s normal to be anxious about your vagina, but a spa isn\u2019t the answer\n\nMORE: Mum could have died from septic shock after developing toxic shock syndrome from her tampon\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Doctors have warned women not to use toothpaste in an attempt to tighten and freshen the vagina for sex.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_89229707_1570782917.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
