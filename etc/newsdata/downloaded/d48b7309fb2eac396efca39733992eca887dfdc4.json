The first show at the newly refurbished Leeds Playhouse, it is surprisingly funny and full of fury.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Natalie Gavin (Helen) in There Are No Beginnings. Photograph: Zoe Martin\n\nTwo young women from Chapeltown teeter on the edge of adulthood. Sharon (Tessa Parr) is 15 when we first meet her: proud, stubborn and overprotective about Donny Osmond. Helen (Natalie Gavin) is a year younger: volatile and vulnerable, curling in on herself as if absorbing all the pain around her. They grow in parallel to each other; while Sharon is at school, Helen is pushed into prostitution. Parr is wide-eyed as they talk in whispers about sex, while her friend \u2013 who knows too much \u2013 tugs at the trauma around her like a heavy blanket.\n\nReports of the violent killings take over the news, frayed sound clips buzzing anxiously between dialogue. At first, it\u2019s mainly prostitutes being killed. Then they announce a new \u201cinnocent\u201d victim. Miles furiously investigates this implication of guilt, and the idea that any blame lies with the women being killed rather than the man doing the killing.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jesse Jones (Fiona) in There Are No Beginnings. Photograph: Zoe Martin\n\nJulie Hesmondhalgh plays Sharon\u2019s mum, June, worn down by worry for both her daughter and the vulnerable girls like Helen who she works with. Jesse Jones completes the quartet as Fiona, an austere, ambitious police officer trying to keep the girls safe. Arguments between the four are heated and loving and full of the charged confusion of trying to protect each other. As the number of victims grows, the adults deal with the mounting fear differently; where Fiona becomes ever more uptight, June becomes increasingly ragged with dread.\n\nIt is said that that women mature faster than men. This show suggests it\u2019s because of what they\u2019re put through. Every story of a woman abducted adds a month. Every time they\u2019re followed home at night adds a year. When they first meet, Sharon puts on a record and leaps around her bedroom, awkwardly trying to get Helen to free up and join in. But dancing for fun quickly gives way to protesting for their rights, as later, a less innocent echo of the scene repeats when Sharon drags Helen to a Reclaim the Night march. Nervous at first, Helen is quiet and restrained, but following Sharon\u2019s example, she begins to leap across the stage and finally releases her rage.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tessa Parr (Sharon) There Are No Beginnings. Photograph: Zoe Martin\n\nAmy Leach\u2019s subtly dynamic direction has the show in traverse, with the majority of the action on a raised terracotta block, and the cast changing clothes around the outside. Few scenes have clear seams, with half-sentences feeding into each other and overlapping. Though the second half slows, with the plot driving somewhat off course in the search of a neat ending, Miles\u2019 play is a raw, emotive depiction of a generation overshadowed by these murders.\n\n\u201cCan you believe that it\u2019s one man doing this to us?\u201d Hesmondhalgh rages. \u201cOne little man. One pathetic boy.\u201d We never hear the killer\u2019s name, and Miles\u2019 script actively smashes the glorification of the violence and the mystery surrounding him. Instead, this stage is a platform for women\u2019s voices. The real pleasure of There Are No Beginnings lies in watching the two teenage girls teach each other how to live, after being forced to grow up too fast.", "description": "The Yorkshire Ripper is never mentioned in Charley Miles\u2019s furious, funny play about women in Leeds between 1975-80", "authors": ["Kate Wyver"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8af1ff44c37ff5e311984311d730372bb68a1baf/0_187_5936_3562/master/5936.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=f992d8e6e3e565eb8e0e504d2e8acb1f", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
