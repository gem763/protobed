The idea has been under discussion in the White House for months and has divided Mr. Trump\u2019s aides, with some warning privately that it could cost him politically ahead of the 2020 election, the people said.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump was thoroughly briefed on the complex economic, legal and regulatory issues, and concluded that at this time he does not feel enough of the benefits will go to the middle class,\u201d White House spokesman Judd Deere said in an email when asked for comment.\n\nOne of the people familiar with the meeting said Mr. Trump didn\u2019t completely rule out eventually trying to index capital gains to inflation, but signaled he had no plans to do it in the short term.\n\nConservative groups and some Republican lawmakers had urged Mr. Trump in recent weeks to move forward with the plan.\n\nAt the same time, Democrats had already begun casting the move as a giveaway to the nation\u2019s wealthy.\n\nWednesday\u2019s meeting included Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Attorney General William Barr, Council of Economic Advisers acting Chairman Tomas Philipson, Office of Management and Budget acting Director Russ Vought, National Economic Council Director Lawrence Kudlow and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, officials said.\n\nThe discussion came after Mr. Trump sent mixed signals about whether he supports such a move, which would likely face legal challenges.\n\nAfter teasing the possibility of indexing capital-gains taxes to inflation last month, Mr. Trump appeared to reverse course the next day, saying it would be seen as \u201csomewhat elitist\u201d because it benefits the wealthy.\n\nBut he brought up the idea again a week later, touting a recent op-ed written by Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) and Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist urging him to index capital-gains taxes to inflation. Messrs. Cruz and Norquist argued in the op-ed that such a move would unleash \u201cuntapped potential across our economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn idea liked by many?\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted, linking to the article.\n\nStocks and bonds aren't your only investment options. There's a whole universe of alternative investments, including natural resources, precious metals, private equity, hedge funds and managed futures. Here's what you need to know.\n\nUnder current law, investors pay taxes on their nominal capital gains, meaning that someone who in 1990 bought $100,000 of stock that is now worth $1 million would pay taxes on $900,000 in capital gains, even though some of that gain is due to inflation.\n\nAllowing taxpayers to adjust their cost basis for inflation might encourage people to sell long-held assets. But it would also reduce taxes by about $100 billion over a decade, according to the Penn-Wharton Budget Model, with most of the benefits going to high-income households.\n\nCapital gains face a top federal tax rate of 23.8%, which is lower than the top rates on wages or profits from closely held businesses. That preferential rate exists, in part, as a rough way of countering the effects of inflation.\n\nThe National Economic Council, the Council of Economic Advisers, the Office of Management and Budget and the Treasury Department had all been reviewing the concept, administration officials said.\n\nSome of Mr. Trump\u2019s aides\u2014including Mr. Kudlow\u2014have long supported the idea. But Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had expressed reservations, aides said.\n\nSupporters of the effort said the discussion of indexing capital gains to inflation wasn\u2019t a direct response to concerns about a potential economic downturn, noting that many in the administration have sought to do it for years.\n\nTo make the change unilaterally, the administration would likely have had to reverse a 1992 opinion by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel that concluded that the Treasury lacked the authority to define the word \u201ccost\u201d to include inflationary gains. The attorney general at the time, William Barr, is again the attorney general.\n\nBefore Wednesday\u2019s meeting, two administration officials said it is unclear whether the Justice Department would alter the opinion, but the officials said the department had been involved in the discussions about the proposal. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nThe meeting also touched on a broader set of tax cuts the administration hopes to move through Congress commonly referred to as \u201cTax Cuts 2.0.\u201d Exactly what would be included in such a package couldn\u2019t be determined, though Republicans have at varying times said it would extend pieces of the 2017 tax law that are scheduled to expire, and hinted at a vague new middle-class tax cut that the administration hasn\u2019t yet detailed.\n\nMr. Trump and his advisers have said they hope to announce a second round of tax cuts in the coming months, but winning congressional approval would likely face major hurdles, given that Democrats now control the House.\n\n\u2014 Richard Rubin contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Andrew Restuccia at Andrew.Restuccia@wsj.com and Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.com", "description": "President Trump told his advisers that he doesn\u2019t plan to try to bypass Congress and lower capital-gains taxes by indexing gains to inflation, according to three people familiar with the matter.", "authors": ["Andrew Restuccia", "Kate Davidson", "Andrew.Restuccia Wsj.Com", "Kate.Davidson Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106133/social", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
