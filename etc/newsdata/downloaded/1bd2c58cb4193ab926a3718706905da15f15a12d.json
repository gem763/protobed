That makes storing their energy and releasing it later, when it\u2019s cloudy and the wind isn\u2019t blowing, one of the biggest challenges for renewable energy.\n\nCurrent devices, like capacitors and batteries, have their limitations, but a team of scientists at Queen Mary University of London just created a more efficient storage method. The little gizmo, based on the flaky French pastry, can hold 30 times more energy than any other device of its kind on the market right now \u2014 and it won\u2019t be any more expensive to produce.\n\n\u201cThe biggest problem with making the grid run on renewable energy sources has got to be energy storage systems,\u201d said Ramamoorthy Ramesh, a professor of physics and materials science and engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved with the study. \u201cOne way to do this is to have these capacitors \u2026 which can store large amounts of energy and discharge that energy very quickly.\u201d\n\nThe scientists invented a modification to a gadget called a polymer film capacitor, which can store energy and release it rapidly. Film capacitors, components found in almost every electronic device, use very thin layers of material as electrical insulation. The scientists figured out that by folding a capacitor over itself the way bakers do with dough to make pastries buttery and delicious, they can make the device more dense and store more energy in a smaller space.\n\nThe findings, published Friday in Nature Communications, could help the grid run on greener, more variable sources of energy like wind and solar.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve probably never made a croissant,\u201d Emiliano Bilotti, an author of the study and a materials engineer at Queen Mary University in London, told VICE News (correctly). \u201cYou should try, because it\u2019s actually quite simple. You put a layer of butter on a layer of dough, you squeeze the two layers together, and you fold it again.\u201d\n\nHuge batteries may ultimately be the key to making the grid run well on renewable energy, but capacitors play a role too. While batteries charge and release power slowly, capacitors do the opposite: They charge and release electricity fast. Depending on energy demand, the grid might release energy from either a battery or a capacitor to help you, say, power your microwave.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about finding a cheap way to store more energy,\u201d Bilotti said. \u201cOther methods have been extremely expensive and technical. The novelty of this capacitor is that we\u2019ve managed to modify commercially available materials to make them more effective.\u201d\n\nThe croissant-like capacitor could also improve other types of technology that people use all the time, not just renewables. The device might have applications in electric cars and wearable tech \u2014 in short, anything that needs to store energy in a minute package and release it quickly.\n\nThat said, this invention isn\u2019t a silver bullet. It\u2019s likely only a component of helping the grid run on renewable energy.\n\n\u201cIn a broader context, this isn\u2019t an Iron Man or Captain America\u2013level invention,\u201d Ramesh said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the supporting characters.\u201d\n\nCover image: Fresh croissants on the market in Palma, April 13, 2019 (Winfried Rothermel/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images)", "description": "Inspired by the flaky pastry, scientists invented a new device for storing renewable energy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5daef74c354287000a09b776/lede/1571747872597-AP_19134433395040.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8096351730589336xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
