Younger, less-educated women were most at risk of abuse overall.\n\nThe authors hope that these revelations will be \u201cused to inform policies and programmes to ensure that all women have positive pregnancy and childbirth experiences,\u201d with the support of \u201cempowered healthcare providers within well-functioning health systems.\u201d\n\nAccording to the WHO, millions of preventable deaths occur annually around the world, outside of the states mentioned above:\n\nOf the more than 130 million births occurring each year, an estimated 303 000 result in the mother\u2019s death, 2.6 million in stillbirth, and another 2.7 million in a newborn death within the first 28 days of birth. The majority of these deaths occur in low-resource settings and most could be prevented.\n\nThe study recommends numerous measures that could be used to address these widespread issues. First, targeted training that addresses \u201ccommunication and consent,\u201d followed by measures to increase patient privacy, and the ability to have a trusted companion present.\n\n\u201cAddressing these inequalities and promoting respectful maternity care for all are key to improve health equity and quality,\u201d the study concludes, warning that \u201caction is urgently needed to enhance the provision of respectful maternity care worldwide.\u201d\n\nThis is just one more recent analysis of medical abuse during childbirth in the region. Harvard\u2019s \u201cMaternal Health Task Force\u201d reviewed the findings of PLOS One and Elsevier studies in 2017, highlighting a 98 percent rate of abuse reported in Nigeria and similarly poor countries.", "description": "A study released on Wednesday found that as many as one in three women suffer abuse during childbirth in Nigeria, Ghana, Myanmar, and Guinea.", "authors": ["Nate Church"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-912804964-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
