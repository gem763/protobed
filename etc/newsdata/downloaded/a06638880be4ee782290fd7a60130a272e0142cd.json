He\u2019s not just speaking to his own audience, which might overlap with Trump\u2019s base, he may also be speaking to the famed audience of one, Donald Trump [who] turns to these TV individuals, some of them, for information. The Washington Post notes that Trump is \u2019as likely to heed a Fox News host as any a senior administration official.\u201d", "description": "\"Little bit like the policeman in that scene from \u2018The Naked Gun\u2019 when a rocket explodes in a fireworks factory.\"", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7c9097240000122779f762.png?cache=ofehhwjr2x&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
