prominent staff members that they had been sacked.\n\nEmployees at the People's Vote campaign staged a walkout on Monday morning after one of the group's most senior figures, Roland Rudd, moved to sack two of the group's most senior members of staff.\n\nTom Baldwin, the People's Vote campaign's head of communications and James McGrory, campaign director, were told to quit their jobs in an email from Rudd on Sunday, the Financial Times reported.\n\nRudd is the chairman of Open Britain, one of the groups that belongs under the People's Vote umbrella.\n\nHowever, Alaistar Campbell, one of the campaign's most well-known figures, on Sunday said Rudd had \"no right\" to sack the pair, and accused him of \"boardroom politics\" which \"with few exceptions has done little for the campaign.\"\n\nCampbell, who rose to prominence as head of communications to ex-prime minister Tony Blair, said Rudd sent the email \"without any consultation with the other groups\" in a series of tweets.\n\n\u2014Alastair PEOPLE\u2019S VOTE Campbell (@campbellclaret) October 27, 2019\n\nThe People's Vote campaign descends into chaos\n\nRudd told staff that Patrick Heneghan, former executive director at the Labour Party, had been appointed the acting chief executive of the People's Vote campaign.\n\nHe later told staff that he would address them in a meeting at the campaign's central London office 9am on Monday.\n\nHowever, he emailed staff shortly after 8:30am, informing them that the meeting had been postponed to Tuesday.\n\nStaff emailed Rudd shortly before 10am on Monday, saying they were waiting for him to arrive at the campaign's office as they \"can't be expected to get on with our jobs until some fundamental questions have been answered.\"\n\nStaff subsequently staged a walkout in protest at Rudd's refusal to address them and decided to work from a cafe after Heneghan told them they could have the day off, sources in the group told Business Insider.\n\nOne campaign source told Business Insider that there would be a number of senior resignations if Roland did not let Baldwin and McGrory report to work on Monday morning.\n\nRudd on Monday morning insisted that \"there's no row\" in the campaign.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he had a \"proper civilised chat\" with Baldwin before he was told to leave his post and said \"he has an opportunity for a different type of role\" in the organisation.\n\nHowever, the People's Vote's campaign official Twitter account accused Rudd of a \"board room coup\" in a series of tweets posted on Monday lunchtime.\n\n\u2014People's Vote UK (@peoplesvote_uk) October 28, 2019\n\nThe fall out within the campaign comes after months of disagreement over what the campaign's strategy for forcing a new referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union should be.\n\nRudd wants to adopt a more explicit Remain position, while figures like Baldwin and McGrory want to focus on winning \"soft\" Leave voters and members of Parliament who could yet be persuaded to support a new referendum, The Observer reported.\n\nThe row also comes in a key week for Brexit and the campaign to put it to a new public vote.\n\nMPs will on Monday vote on whether to hold a general election before Christmas after last week voting against Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan to force through all Brexit legislation by October 31.\n\nThe controversy in the campaign also came just hours before European Council leader Donald Tusk confirmed that Brexit had been delayed until January 31.\n\nA campaign source said staff had \"not been told what to do\" when news of the Brexit delay broke, and that the office was in a state of confusion after Rudd cancelled the Monday morning meeting.\n\n\"The staff decided we are waiting for Roland and Patrick to come up to the office and answer our questions, as they promised they would do in an email to all staff last night,\" they told Business Insider this morning.", "description": "The leading campaign group for a new Brexit referendum is at war with itself after senior members of staff were sacked on Monday.", "authors": ["Adam Payne"], "top_image":
