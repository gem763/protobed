And it is likely that those changes will determine the extent to which England are successful in Sofia.\n\nA 4-0 thrashing of the same opposition at Wembley last month should serve as good omens for Southgate\u2019s side, but destroying a team at home holds little importance as England discovered in their 2-1 defeat on Friday, a side that they had thrashed 5-0 on home soil.\n\nHowever, Bulgaria sit bottom of group A and this is close to the perfect fixture that Southgate would have chosen to get a low-confidence England back on their feet.\n\nWhichever front three Southgate chooses will cause problems for the Bulgaria defence, and should England show improvement defensively they will leave Sofia three points clear at the top of the group once again.\n\nWhen is it?\n\nKick-off is at 7:45 PM BST on Monday 14th October\n\nHow can I watch it?\n\nThe match will be broadcast on ITV1 from 7pm.\n\nYou can also live stream the match via ITV HUB Live on a range of devices, including laptops, smartphones and tablets.\n\nTeam news\n\nSouthgate is expected to make several changes to the line-up that lost in Prague, including handing an international debut to Tyrone Mings.\n\nThe Aston Villa defender is set to come in ahead of Joe Gomez to replace Michael Keane, whose latest struggle in England colours came against Czech Republic on Friday.\n\nLeicester\u2019s Ben Chilwell is also poised to replace the suspended Danny Rose, while Trent Alexander-Arnold could also come in for Kieran Trippier in the other full-back position.\n\nMidfielder Harry Winks is also in line for a starting berth after Declan Rice missed training through illness, while Ross Barkley may also replace Chelsea teammate Mason Mount.\n\nPredicted line-up\n\nPickford, Chilwell, Maguire, Mings, Alexander-Arnold, Henderson, Winks, Barkley, Sterling, Sancho, Kane\n\nOdds\n\nEngland are the favourites for this game despite Friday\u2019s defeat, with Paddy Power backing them at 1/5, while Bulgaria can be backed for inflicting a second successive defeat on Southgate\u2019s men for odds of 11/1.\n\nFor a draw you can get odds of 9/2.", "description": "England\u00a0take on Bulgaria\u00a0on Monday\u00a0looking to bounce back from their disappointing defeat to Czech Republic on Friday. \u00a0 Gareth Southgate\u2019s side still sit\u00a0top of group A, but now only on goal difference after Jakub Brabec and Zdenek Ondrasek\u2019s goals helped inflict\u00a0a 2-1 defeat on England following Harry Kane\u2018s opener\u00a0from the penalty spot.", "authors": ["Kishan Vaghela"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/12/08/gareth-southgate-czech-republic.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
