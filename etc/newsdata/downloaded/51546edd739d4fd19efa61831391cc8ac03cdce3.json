(AP) \u2014 Colleges are becoming a battleground in the conflict between federal and state marijuana laws as students who use medical pot challenge decades-old campus drug policies.\n\nIn states where medical marijuana is legal, students disciplined for using it are taking their schools to court. College officials argue they could lose federal funding for failing to follow federal law that labels cannabis an illegal drug with no accepted medical use.\n\nSheida Assar said she was expelled from GateWay Community College in Phoenix last month for violating the school\u2019s drug policy after she tested positive for marijuana, which she uses to treat chronic pain from polycystic ovary syndrome.\n\nShe was studying diagnostic medical sonography, Assar said, and an instructor had told her she wouldn\u2019t have any problems if she presented her Arizona medical marijuana card. She typically uses marijuana to help her sleep and had never been under the influence in class, she said.\n\n\u201cThey yanked me out of class in the middle of the school day,\u201d said Assar, 31, of Chandler, Arizona. \u201cThey escorted me to the administration like I was a ... criminal. It\u2019s discrimination, and it also violates my rights under the Arizona medical marijuana law.\u201d\n\nThe legal challenges are coming from students studying nursing and other medical specialties who, under school policies, must undergo drug testing.\n\nAssar and other students say they received approval to use medical marijuana from college employees who serve students with health-related needs \u2014 only to face discipline from higher-ranking school officials.\n\nAssar said she intends to sue GateWay to recoup the $2,000 she spent on tuition and other educational expenses and seek more money in damages. Her lawyer already has been in contact with the school, she said.\n\nA GateWay spokeswoman, Christine Lambrakis, said that she could not confirm Assar\u2019s status at the school and that the college continues to prohibit marijuana use.\n\nAsked about an Arizona Supreme Court ruling last year that overturned a 2012 state law that made possession or use of marijuana on college campuses a crime, Lambrakis said the school is in the process of reviewing its policies and will not change them in the meantime.\n\nThirty-three states and Washington, D.C., allow medical marijuana, and 11 states and Washington, D.C., have legalized recreational marijuana, creating clashes with federal law that have been playing out in courts, mostly in employment cases that have had mixed results for medical pot.\n\nThere don\u2019t appear to be efforts by recreational marijuana users to challenge college drug policies, observers say. That\u2019s likely because states limit recreational use to people 21 and older, excluding most college students, and because there haven\u2019t been successful legal challenges to campus alcohol policies even though state laws allow people 21 and over to drink, they say.\n\nStates with medical marijuana laws allow use by people 18 years or older with a doctor\u2019s recommendation, as well as by minors if their parents approve.\n\nConnecticut nursing student Kathryn Magner sued Sacred Heart University last month after she tested positive for marijuana and was barred from attending required clinical medical rounds, according to her lawsuit. She had begun using marijuana legally in her home state of Massachusetts over the summer to treat conditions that were not disclosed in legal documents.\n\nConnecticut law allows medical marijuana and forbids public and private colleges from discriminating against students who use it. A judge cited the state\u2019s law in ordering that Magner, 22, from Marlborough, Massachusetts, be allowed to return to the medical rounds. The lawsuit was settled under undisclosed terms.\n\nBefore the settlement, she stopped using marijuana, passed a drug screening and obtained approval to use medical pot from the Fairfield school\u2019s Office of Student Accessibility to try to salvage her nursing career, her lawsuit said. But nursing school officials wouldn\u2019t budge, her lawsuit said.\n\n\u201cMany schools disability services offices are not universally listened to by the university,\u201d said Michael Thad Allen, an attorney for Magner. \u201cIt just shows that these kinds of issues will become more common if employers and schools don\u2019t abide by the law.\u201d\n\nSacred Heart requires students to \u201cobey the law at all times,\u201d but it treats medical marijuana like other disability-related requests and \u201cseeks to provide reasonable accommodation under the law,\u201d school officials said in a statement.\n\nIn Florida, Kaitlin McKeon, of Naples, is suing Nova Southeastern University for expelling her from its nursing program in Fort Myers last year after she tested positive for marijuana. She has a state medical marijuana card to take the drug for several conditions.\n\nMcKeon also said school officials told her there would be no problem with her use of medical marijuana under the provisions of state law.\n\nBut after she failed the drug test in January 2018, higher-ranking officials moved to expel her, saying she violated the school\u2019s drug policy, her lawsuit says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really sad that Nova Southeastern ... took this stance on this issue and is really preventing a really good, caring person from entering the nursing field and living out her dream because she chose a medication that\u2019s legal in Florida but not one that they recognize,\u201d said her lawyer, Michael Minardi.\n\nNova Southeastern officials said they cannot comment on pending litigation.\n\nThe lawsuits have the potential to set legal precedents on the use of medical marijuana at colleges.\n\nIn the meantime, advocates say, universities can lighten penalties so students do not face expulsion or suspension for legally using medical marijuana.\n\n\u201cUniversities can effectively decriminalize it, de-punish it and make it not something they focus on,\u201d said Jared Moffat, campaigns coordinator for the Marijuana Policy Project, an advocacy group for pro-marijuana laws.", "description": "College officials claim they could lose federal funding for failing to follow federal law even in states where medical marijuana is legal.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FY060_weedet_ZG_20171109115531.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
