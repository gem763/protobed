Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said the recent withdrawal has raised worries beyond Israel.\n\n\u201cThere is danger and damage to every one of our allies in the area,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no one in the area who is better off as a result of this invasion except for Iran and Russia and Syria.\u201d\n\nThe administration has pushed back against the argument that Iran is now in a better strategic position.\n\n\u201cNothing has changed with the president\u2019s recent decision of withdrawing troops from Syria,\u201d Brian Hook, the U.S. special representative for Iran, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday. \u201cOur strategy is around denying revenue [to Iran] and using diplomatic leverage in Syria to get Iranian forces out.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYet Trump\u2019s sudden removal of U.S. troops have allies fearing that the president\u2019s \u201cgut-instinct\u201d policy, with little appearance of long-term strategy, will soon hurt them.\n\n\u201cI think that everybody in the Middle East recognizes that this administration is a complete circus,\u201d said Danielle Pletka, senior vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\n\u201cIn terms of how Netanyahu plays this, he\u2019s going to do exactly what the Saudis and the Emiratis and the others have done, which is to hedge their bets, not rely on assurances from the United States about anything, ensure that they have the ability to execute whatever they need to and keep it pleasant with the Trump administration. Because how else are they going to manage?\u201d\n\nWithout a strong U.S. presence in the Middle East, Netanyahu risks losing leverage with Russian President Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinSusan Rice blasts Trump as 'total sell-out' for saying Kurds are 'more of a terrorist threat' than ISIS Trump adviser heads to Turkey ahead of Pence to urge cease-fire Five unintended consequences of Trump's Syria withdrawal MORE.\n\n\u201cThe Russians are only going to be more influential because of Trump's decision,\u201d said Daniel Shapiro, former U.S. ambassador to Israel who\u2019s now a visiting fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv.\n\nNetanyahu \u201cwill probably be looking for a new opportunity to go up to Moscow and explain, yet again, what Israel\u2019s needs are, and try to ensure that he still has the Russian understanding. But he\u2019s in a weaker position to ask,\u201d Shapiro said.\n\nMore worrying for Israelis, Shapiro said, is Trump\u2019s apparent inaction in the face of bold Iranian aggression \u2014 such as the summer attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, the downing of a U.S. drone, and the attack on Saudi oil facilities last month \u2014 despite reports of retaliatory U.S. cyber attacks.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re Netanyahu, do you believe that Trump is \u2014 after what we\u2019ve seen, not just in the Syria decisions but in the Gulf decisions as well \u2014 do you believe Trump is going to participate, have U.S. forces participate in any kind of confrontation with Iran? I don\u2019t think Pompeo\u2019s holding a strong hand if he\u2019s trying to make that case,\u201d Shapiro said.\n\nWhile Netanyahu parades in front of the public his close friendship with Trump \u2014 his Twitter background is a cropped photo of him at the White House shaking hands with the American president \u2014 a lack of recent displays of support have onlookers speculating about tension between the two leaders.\n\nWhen reporters asked Trump last month if he had spoken to the Israeli leader following a second round of indecisive elections, the president appeared to distance himself from Netanyahu by saying, \u201cOur relationship is with Israel, we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump has largely ignored Netanyahu since he wasn\u2019t able to form a government in May,\u201d Shapiro said.\n\nPletka, of the American Enterprise Institute, said the meeting between Pompeo and Netanyahu will likely showcase the ceremony of close allies shaking hands, smiling and offering strong statements of assurance and commitment.\n\nBut, she warned, those commitments are meaningless when they are just rhetoric.\n\n\u201cI think that for everybody, this is the moment when they recognize \u2014 notwithstanding the president\u2019s Twitter feed \u2014 \u2018you guys don\u2019t have our back.\u2019\u201d", "description": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo finds himself in a difficult position ahead of Friday\u2019s meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following the withdrawal of troops from northern Syria and little concrete action against Iran\u2019s aggressi", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/pompeomike_101719getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
