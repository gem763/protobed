He plans to meet with Singapore authorities and will cease using the machine permanently if ordered.\n\nRestaurants across Asia often keep live seafood in tanks for diners to pick out for their meals.", "description": "Singapore (AFP) \u2013 A Singapore restaurant Thursday suspended a bizarre promotional stunt where customers use an arcade-style machine with a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
