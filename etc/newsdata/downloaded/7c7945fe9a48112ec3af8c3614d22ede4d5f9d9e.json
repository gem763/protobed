He was 73.\n\nKnown locally as the Barkers Point Ace, the left winger made his NHL debut playing one game with the Montreal Canadiens in 1965-66.\n\nWhile he only appeared in 22 regular season games, he did help the Habs win the Stanley Cup in 1968, playing in 10 playoff games.\n\nHe was then traded to the Minnesota North Stars and won the Calder Trophy as NHL Rookie of the Year in the 1968-69 season.\n\nIt was seven years later when Grant really made his mark, scoring 50 goals in a single season with the Detroit Red Wings.\n\nNHL Hall of Famer Marcel Dionne said he'll remember Danny Grant as a 'very nice guy' and 'a real sniper.' (Marcel Dionne Inc.)\n\nNHL Hall of Famer Marcel Dionne was his linemate during that outstanding 1974-75 season.\n\n\"Very nice guy,\" Dionne told CBC News on Tuesday. \"I played against him until I played with him. I appreciate the value of his friendship. And he was a real sniper. I will tell you this right now. He was a sniper.\"\n\nInjuries subsequently limited Grant's playing time and cut his career short.\n\n\"I think Danny was the best player ever to come out of the national hockey from New Brunswick,\" said Dave Morell, a former sports broadcaster and long-time friend.\n\n\"A great player, a good person, a great community guy.\"\n\nFormer sports broadcaster Dave Morell said his friend Danny Grant will be remembered for being New Brunswick's greatest hockey player, as well as for his community work. (CBC)\n\nMorell, who visited Grant during his illness, said he always enjoyed being around him. \"Danny had a smile that would take over a room. When he smiled it was his eyes, it was his ears \u2014 everything smiled.\"\n\nGrant also made friends easily and had a way of putting people around him at ease \u2014 \"that he wasn't anything special, that he was just another guy,\" said Morell. \"And if you ever tried to put a spotlight on him, he always deferred.\"\n\n\"His legacy in sport will live on through the impact he has made on so many,\" the New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame posted on Twitter Tuesday.\n\nGrant was inducted into the New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame in 1985.\n\nWe are deeply saddened by the passing of Hall of Famer and Sports Ambassador Danny Grant.

(CBC)\n\nIn 2008, a new arena being built on Fredericton's south side was slated to be named the Danny Grant Centre in his honour, but Grant asked council to include the name of his friend and former teammate, Fred (Buster) Harvey, who died after a battle with cancer.\n\nHarvey, also a Fredericton native, was best known for playing with the Minnesota North Stars during the early 1970s. He also played with the Atlanta Flames and the Detroit Red Wings before returning to New Brunswick to serve as head coach of the Fredericton Red Wings in 1979-80.\n\nCouncil agreed to name the arena the Grant-Harvey Centre.\n\nDanny Grant moved back to his farm just outside Fredericton when he left the National Hockey League. (CBC)\n\nJake Allen, goaltender for the St. Louis Blues and Fredericton native, offered his condolences to the Grant family on Twitter Tuesday.\n\n\"A local hero and resident in the NB community,\" he tweeted.
