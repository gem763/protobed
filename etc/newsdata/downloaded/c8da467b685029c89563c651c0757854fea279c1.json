(Beau Finley/Flickr)\n\nIt was another cooler than recent times kind of day that wasn\u2019t all that cool. Highs near and above 80 are about five to seven degrees above normal for the date. Lower humidity and a breeze helped negate that a good deal, but perhaps also a little frustrating to miss out on those mid-70s average highs! Today\u2019s as low as we\u2019ll see high temperatures rise for a while.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough Tonight: Our break in the humidity ends up short lived as winds from the south are already pumping more moisture into the area. This helps keep lows up from last night, with most spots settling to the 60s. Under partly cloudy skies, winds continue to blow around 5 mph after dark, from the south.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Saturday): Skies are mostly sunny early, and high levels of humidity -- dew points approaching 70 -- make it feel a bit icky. Highs should rise to the mid-80s in the cooler spots north and west to as high as the low 90s in the hottest locations. We\u2019ll need to eye the potential of some afternoon or evening storms moving in from the west. Whether they survive the journey is still to be decided.\n\nSunday: We\u2019re behind a weak front by Sunday, which means it should be a touch cooler than Saturday, but perhaps not much. Highs are largely in the mid-and-upper 80s. Sunshine rules once again, and humidity is still rather high, so it\u2019ll still be feeling like summer.\n\nSee Camden Walker\u2019s forecast through the beginning of next week.
