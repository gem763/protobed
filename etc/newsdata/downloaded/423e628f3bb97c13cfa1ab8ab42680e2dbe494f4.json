The expletive-filled video shared on shows the white man confronting Cristina Riofrio for speaking Spanish to her friends, saying she probably came over on a boat.\n\nAt one point, Riofrio says \"I'm videoing this. You're a racist,\" to which the man replies, \"I know I am.\" Riofrio says the man shouldn't be proud of that fact just before an off-screen employee tells the man he needs to leave.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
