Ren Yonezawa of Japan missed a short par putt and had to settle for a 73.\n\nJust like that, they were tied for the lead, and had plenty of company. Yung-Hua Liu of Taiwan and Yuto Katsuragawa of Japan each shot 69 for a four-way share of the lead at 8-under 208.\n\nIn the 10 previous editions of the Asia-Pacific Amateur, there had never been a tie after 54 holes. Now there are four players tied for the lead, all aiming to win the tournament and earn a spot in the Masters and the British Open next year.\n\nWindred, who tied the tournament record with a 63 in the first round, was happy to be part of the mix after the way his round was going.\n\n\u201cWhat I can take away from today is that it wasn\u2019t my best performance at all, but I was quite happy with my attitude on the golf course and when I rolled that birdie putt in on the last,\u201d Windred said. \u201cOn the last tee, I was 7 under and I didn\u2019t feel great mentally. But I told myself that there\u2019s another day and another opportunity to shoot a low score and take home the trophy.\n\n\u201cThat kind of pumped me up a little bit, and then I was in the right space to make a birdie on the last.\u201d\n\nSix other players were within three shots of the lead, a group that includes defending champion Takumi Kanaya of Japan, who shot 68 to get within one shot; and Yuxin Lin of China, who won the Asia-Pacific two years ago. He shot 71 and was among those shots behind.\n\nYonezawa, a 20-year-old who attends the same Tokyo university as Kanaya and two-time Asia-Pacific winner Hideki Matsuyama, has the best form going into the final day. He has finished among the top four in six of his last eight tournaments, and he has won three times this year.\n\nHe was runner-up at the Asia-Pacific Open Diamond Cup on the Japan Golf Tour, which would have earned him a spot in the British Open. Now he can earn his way to Royal St. George\u2019s next year by winning, along with a tee time at Augusta National in April.\n\n\u201cI am in a good position,\u201d Yonezawa said. \u201cI just need to work on my short-range putting today and I think I should be ready for the battle tomorrow.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Blake Windred of Australia has another entry in the record book at the Asia-Pacific Amateur, and it felt better than it might appear.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
