The Charter reaffirms the tenets of the 1976 Arab Convention on the Arab women workers and the 2004 Arab Charter on Human Rights. It also aligns with the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action and the UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security.\n\nHer Highness Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak\u2019s speech, delivered on her behalf by the UAE Minister of State for Tolerance, described the Charter as a historical document that reflects the natural keenness to engage women in sustainable development that is prevalent in the Arab region, and highlighted the contribution of women to the UAE\u2019s achievements.\n\nDr Al Qubaisi said: \u201cWhile developing the Charter over the past two years, we conducted 12 in-depth studies discussed across five workshops held by the Arab Parliament and worked closely with other parliaments and councils in the Arab world. These efforts aimed to garner support for the Charter to ensure its success and sustainability.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThe model of women\u2019s empowerment presented by Her Highness focuses on empowering society through women. The UAE\u2019s achievements in this regard are the result of carefully devised strategies, most notably the National Strategy for Empowerment of Emirati Women.\u201d\n\n*Source: AETOSWire\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191008005832/en/\n\nContacts\n\nFederal National Council, United Arab Emirates\n\nAbdlrahman Al Najar, +97143033816\n\na.alnajjar@almajles.gov.ae", "description": "ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Under the patronage of Her Highness Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak, Chairperson of the General Women\u2019s Union, Supreme Chairperson of the Family Development Foundation, and Chairwoman of the Supreme Council for Motherhood and Childhood, the Federal National...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bw20191008005832_group_photo_-_28photo_-_aetoswire29.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
