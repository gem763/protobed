Asian stocks rose on hopes for a thaw in U.S.-China trade frictions and expectations that the ECB will kick off another wave of monetary easing by global central banks. Indian equity markets are also moving in positive territory since opening, but still look amid growing worries over domestic fundamentals.\n\nOn analysis of the movements of , in different time frames, I find that despite a strong opening, Nifty has been constantly facing stiff resistance at its immediate resistance at 11,058; seems to be facing bearish pressure from Nifty IT as the consumer price index data due on Thursday. The country's retail inflation likely rose to a 10-month high in August, while staying below the Reserve Bank of India's medium-term target of 4%, a Reuters poll of economists showed.\n\nAlthough, the U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday welcomed China's decision to exempt some U.S. anti-cancer drugs and other goods from its tariffs and announced a delay to scheduled tariff hikes on billions worth of Chinese goods. Trump called on the \"boneheads\" at the Federal Reserve to push interest rates down into negative territory, a move reluctantly used by other central banks to battle weak economic growth that risks punishing savers and banks' earnings. U.S. producer prices unexpectedly rose in August, but the overall trend in producer inflation remains tame, cementing financial market expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again next week to support a slowing economy.\n\nNo doubt that the ECB is set to unveil fresh stimulus measures on Thursday to prop up the ailing euro zone economy, but its exact moves are far from certain and a decision that underwhelms markets risks, pushing up borrowing costs. Secondly, British government's plans for a no-deal Brexit warn of severe disruption to cross-Channel routes, affecting the supply of medicines and certain types of fresh foods.\n\nI find that despite a strong opening, has been constantly facing stiff resistance at its immediate resistance at 11,081; seems to be facing bearish pressure from Nifty IT as the consumer price index data due on Thursday. The country's retail inflation likely rose to a 10-month high in August, while staying below the Reserve Bank of India's medium-term target of 4%, a Reuters poll of economists showed.\n\nOn the other hand, India's auto sales is witnessing a painful slowdown with the country's economy cooling, growth slowing to a more than five- year low in April-June, and key sectors including real estate and agriculture looking at a slowdown. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday said the government will soon respond to the demands of the automobile sector, which is crippled by plunging sales.\n\nFinally, I find that if the make a sustainable move above 11,111, only then an end to bearishness can be confirmed; otherwise, sell offs may be seen, if Nifty 50 is not able to defend the level of 10,911 on September 12th, 2019.
