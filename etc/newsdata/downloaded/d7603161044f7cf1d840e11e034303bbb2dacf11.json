The Steelers announced before the start of the third quarter that Mason Rudolph would take over and that Roethlisberger was questionable to return.\n\nRoethlisberger didn\u2019t return and was later joined on the bench by running back James Conner, who suffered a knee injury. Head coach Mike Tomlin said after the game that both players were being evaluated and offered no other update.\n\nGerry Dulac of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports Roethlisberger will have an MRI.\n\nEvaluation was also the word for linebacker Vince Williams (hamstring), safety Sean Davis (shoulder) and linebacker Anthony Chickillo (plantar fasciatis), so the Steelers will have a lot of action in the trainer\u2019s room in the next few days.", "description": "The Steelers saw several players leave Sunday's 28-26 loss to the Seahawks with injuries, including quarterback Ben Roethlisberger.
