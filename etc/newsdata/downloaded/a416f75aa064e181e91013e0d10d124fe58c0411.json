One hundred million is not very satisfactory.\"\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nRatcliffe first ventured into sports by investing \u00a3110m in Britain's America's Cup sailing team last year, plus he rebranded cycling giants Team Sky as Team Ineos when he purchased them ahead of this year's Tour de France.\n\nThe tycoon's Team Ineos were behind the recent sub-two hour marathon triumph of runner Eliud Kipchoge in Vienna, and also boast Austrian side FC Lausanne-Sport among their portfolio.\n\nHe was brought up as a \u00ad Manchester United fan but after moving to London became a Chelsea season-ticket holder.\n\nRatcliffe confessed earlier in the year: \u201cI\u2019m a tortured Manchester United fan. But let\u2019s not go there!\u201d\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nNice are currently ninth in the table after nine games, having suffered four wins and four defeats.\n\nThey are managed by ex-Arsenal midfielder Patrick Vieira, who Ratcliffe admits he took a particular distaste to previously.\n\n\"I like Patrick because he's interested in young people and he's a very good young coach. I've met him twice before - I hated him!\n\n\"At Arsenal , he had his duels against Manchester United with Roy Keane ... He really was a b******, and now I have to be nice to him.\"", "description": "The Team Ineos owner considered ownership of several Premier League clubs before settling on France", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20647241.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FILES-SWITZERLAND-BRITAIN-BUSINESS-MARKETING-SPORT-INEOS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
