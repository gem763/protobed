Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, sat his colleagues down over lunch in the Capitol and warned them to prepare for an extended impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.\n\nAccording to people who were there, he came equipped with a PowerPoint presentation, complete with quotes from the Constitution, as he schooled fellow senators on the intricacies of a process he portrayed as all but inevitable.\n\nFew Republicans are inclined to convict Trump on charges that he abused his power to enlist Ukraine in an effort to smear his political rivals. Instead, McConnell, R-Ky., sees the proceedings as necessary to protect a half-dozen moderates in states like Maine, Colorado and North Carolina who face reelection next year and must show voters they are giving the House impeachment charges a serious review.\n\nIt\u2019s people like Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who will be under immense political pressure as they decide the president\u2019s fate.\n\n\u201cTo overturn an election, to decide whether or not to convict a president is about as serious as it gets,\u201d Collins said.\n\nMcConnell is walking a careful line of his own in managing the fast-moving impeachment process. On Friday, the senator wrote a scathing op-ed criticizing the president\u2019s decision to pull back troops from northern Syria, calling it a \u201cgrave strategic mistake,\u201d without naming Trump. But McConnell, who is known for his ruthless partisan maneuvering, also views it as his role to protect a president of his own party from impeachment, and in a recent fundraising video, he vowed to stop it.\n\nThe mood among Republicans on Capitol Hill has shifted from indignant to anxious as a parade of administration witnesses has submitted to closed-door questioning by impeachment investigators and corroborated central elements of the whistleblower complaint that sparked the inquiry.\n\nThey grew more worried still Thursday, after Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, undercut the president\u2019s defense by saying that Trump had indeed withheld security aid from Ukraine in order to spur an investigation of his political rivals. Mulvaney later backtracked, but the damage was done.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it \u2014 I was very surprised that he said that,\u201d said Rep. Francis Rooney, R-Fla., who mocked Mulvaney\u2019s attempts to take back comments, that had been broadcast live from the White House briefing room.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an Etch-A-Sketch,\u201d Rooney said, miming the tipping movement that erases the toy drawing board. \u201cThere were a lot of Republicans looking at that headline yesterday when it came up, I certainly was.\u201d\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who is seen as potentially open to removing Trump from office \u2014 told reporters that a president should never engage in the kinds of actions that Mulvaney appeared to acknowledge.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t hold up foreign aid that we had previously appropriated for a political initiative,\u201d she said. \u201cPeriod.\u201d\n\nStill, Republicans said they did not detect a significant shift that would pose a serious threat to the president in the Senate. It would require 20 Republicans to side with Democrats in convicting Trump, and few observers believe that will happen.\n\nMcConnell, his allies said, regards the impeachment fight in much the same way as he did the struggle last year to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, in which he was primarily concerned with protecting his Senate majority by insulating vulnerable incumbents. Then, as now, they said, McConnell is focused on keeping Republicans as united as possible, while allowing those with reservations about Trump\u2019s conduct and their own political considerations to justify their decision to their constituents.\n\n\u201cI think he will play it straight,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, a close McConnell ally, who noted his party\u2019s narrow voting margin. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has any alternative. When you are operating with 53 you have thin margins and you can\u2019t jam anybody or you end up with undesirable consequences.\u201d\n\nMcConnell has told colleagues he expects the House to impeach Trump quickly, possibly by Thanksgiving, an educated hunch based on the pace of the inquiry so far and Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s decision to keep the inquiry narrowly focused on Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. He plans to move swiftly too, he told colleagues, using the approach of Christmas to force the Senate to complete its work before the beginning of 2020.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- It was only a few weeks ago that the top Senate Republican was hinting that his chamber would make short work of impeachment.But this week, Sen.
