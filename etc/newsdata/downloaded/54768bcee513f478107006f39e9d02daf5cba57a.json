It will stay only eight weeks rather than the full four months.\n\n\u201cThe Vitruvian Man, such a discreet drawing on paper, but so revolutionary,\u201d said Susan Prion, 63, a professor of medicine.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 Leonardo da Vinci is the star in a blockbuster retrospective opening Thursday at the Louvre museum in Paris to mark 500 years since", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/88bf58_head-woman-loaned-by-galerie-nationale-parma-italy-is-162-works-on-display-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
