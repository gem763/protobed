YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE {{item.title}}\n\nIt would be a travesty to visit Paris without at least once sitting on a sidewalk caf\u00e9 sipping on a steamy coffee and munching on a melt-in-your-mouth croissant.\n\nWhile the traditional French caf\u00e9 is thriving in the cities and big tourist destinations, those in rural France are fading away. As populations plummet in small villages, caf\u00e9s are struggling, with so many closing up shop that some communities no longer even have one.\n\nQUICK GUIDE TO FRANCE: Say Bonjour to your next escape\n\nBut President Emmanuel Macron is not letting them die on his watch - last month he launched the 1000 Caf\u00e9s project where the French government will provide financial assistance and support to maintaining and opening a thousand caf\u00e9s in a 1000 villages with less than 3 500 residents.\n\nThese places are seen as vital social centres for communities, and seeing as 30% of the French population live in these rural villages it's seen as a vital service and a way to revitalise these communities.\n\n\"Operator of the 1000 caf\u00e9s initiative, the SOS GROUP, proposes to contribute to the social bond in rural areas by opening multi-service caf\u00e9s,\" it says on the project's website.\n\n\"In addition to offering drinks and snacks, these caf\u00e9s will be able to host a range of local services, such as a bread depot, a local fresh produce outlet, a post office, a digital access point, as well as a shared workspace, event planning, cultural and civic, or a tourist information point.\"\n\nREAD: I went to the 'most beautiful caf\u00e9 in the world' - and this is what I thought\n\nThe project is calling on mayors to apply if they have a caf\u00e9 in danger of closing or no longer have one, and it can't be a franchise or branded coffee shop.\n\nNow you might be tempted to plan a road trip through rural France to help the cause!\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
