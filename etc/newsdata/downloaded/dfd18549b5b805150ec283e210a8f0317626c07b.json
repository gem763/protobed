The raid led to a counter-attack by heavily armed men who surrounded the house and troops and, in what appeared to be a carefully orchestrated plan that will surely inspire a new Netflix series, unleashed chaos throughout the city with incredible precision.\n\nThe men, presumed to be members of the Sinaloa Cartel that El Chapo once led, worked in tandem, carrying high-caliber weapons. They blocked intersections, closed toll booths and burned cars. At the same time, inmates inside the local prison rioted in what appeared to be a planned attack, taking weapons from guards and breaking free. Of the 56 dangerous prisoners who escaped, 49 remained at large on Saturday morning, according to Sinaloa Public Security Secretary Crist\u00f3bal Casta\u00f1eda.\n\nAs the chaos unfolded, Mexican authorities now say they had no choice but to release El Chapo\u2019s son in the name of peace. \u201cThis decision was made to protect citizens,\u201d Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said Friday. \u201cYou cannot fight fire with fire. We do not want deaths. We do not want war.\u201d\n\nEl Chapo\u2019s sons Joaquin Guzman Lopez, 34, and Ovidio Guzman Lopez, 28, were charged for conspiring to distribute cocaine, meth and marijuana within the U.S. starting in April 2008 until April 2018. An extradition order for both was unsealed in Feb. 2019, which triggered the raid this week.\n\nState Security Secretary Alfonso Durazo admitted that security forces had not taken into account the cartel members would be waiting for them. El Chapo\u2019s three sons are among the most wanted men in Mexico and their protection is seen as a matter of priority by the cartel.\n\nEl Chapo, who is serving life prison in the U.S. for drug trafficking, was also the master of escape, evading authorities for years, even escaping prison through a tunnel built into his jail cell floor.\n\nThe son who was captured is seen as the least known of the famous drug kingpin\u2019s sons. Guzman\u2019s other sons, Iv\u00e1n Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n and Jes\u00fas Alfredo Guzm\u00e1n are far better known and referred to as \u201cLos Chapitos\u201d which means the \u201clittle Chapos.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was a failed operation,\u201d Durazo said Friday. He also said the troops involved in the raid acted independently to release the younger Guzman to prevent retaliation being carried out against the civilian population. \u201cWe are not going to convert Mexico into a greater cemetery than it already is,\u201d he said.", "description": "The raid, which was carried out on a U.S. extradition order, led to the escape of more than 50 prisoners, the death of 8 people, and the release of El Chapo\u2019s son.", "authors": ["Barbie Latza Nadeau"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1694,w_3012,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571487774/GettyImages-1176418314_pcburc", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
