What about their universities?\n\nThey could be.\n\nIf neither California nor the N.C.A.A. changes course, student-athletes with agents or endorsement contracts will be in violation of the association\u2019s rules. Normally, that would leave them ineligible to play.\n\nIn a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom in September, the N.C.A.A.\u2019s Board of Governors said California schools might gain \u201can unfair recruiting advantage\u201d because of the law, and they would eventually be barred from N.C.A.A. competition.\n\nColleges and universities could face substantial fines \u2014 \u201cpotentially in the millions of dollars,\u201d according to a legislative analysis \u2014 for N.C.A.A. violations, and the financial losses would be even steeper if universities lose eligibility for their teams to compete.\n\nIt is not clear, though, whether the N.C.A.A. could legally enforce any fines. California officials have said they do not believe the N.C.A.A. could punish colleges or athletes for complying with a state law.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, the N.C.A.A. said it would \u201cconsider next steps in California.\u201d\n\nIs California crazy?\n\nCalifornia is betting that the N.C.A.A. will back down before the law takes effect in January 2023. Given the threats of litigation, fines and competition restrictions, t hat\u2019s a risky proposition , but state officials contend that the N.C.A.A. and its members across the country simply cannot afford to ban or penalize California\u2019s colleges and universities.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the biggest media markets on planet Earth,\u201d Newsom said in an interview with The New York Times. \u201cMedia cannot afford not to have California at scale being participatory in the tournaments. They know that, we know that, it\u2019s a threat. I don\u2019t necessarily take it to heart.\u201d\n\nHow are people reacting?\n\nLess than two hours after the governor\u2019s decision became public, the N.C.A.A. said the law was already \u201ccreating confusion for current and future student-athletes, coaches, administrators and campuses, and not just in California.\u201d The N.C.A.A., which could bring a lawsuit to challenge the California statute, said its members would continue to weigh changes to their rules.", "description": "California is challenging the N.C.A.A.\u2019s business model built on amateur athletes.
