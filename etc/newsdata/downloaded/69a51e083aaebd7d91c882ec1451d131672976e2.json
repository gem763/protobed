Korea\n\nThe U.S. and North Korea are scheduled to restart nuclear talks this weekend despite a series of recent North Korean missile tests. The State Department earlier this week confirmed the talks; North Korea's first vice foreign minister, Choe Son-hui, said negotiations would begin Saturday. North Korea has conducted a half-dozen short-range missile tests in recent months, including the test-firing Wednesday of a new submarine-launched ballistic missile. President Trump has downplayed the significance of those weapons tests, even as others said North Korea was violating United Nations Security Council resolutions.\n\nA bigger threat?

The heat wave has forced the region to endure a number of high-temperature records, including a high of 97 degrees in Atlanta on Friday. The relief is expected to begin this weekend across the Carolinas and parts of Georgia where highs in the 90s will be replaced by highs in the 70s and 80s. But Accuweather warned folks in the Deep South will have to wait until early next week to see the same relief. The heat may finally be subsiding, but the effects may linger. In addition to the scorching heat, the South has also dealt with a lack of significant rainfall over the past few weeks, triggering what climate experts are calling a \"flash drought.\" The drought, which is affecting 45 million people in 14 states, is cracking farm soil, putting stress on a variety of crops and raising the risk of wildfires.\n\nCLOSE If you think it's hot now, just wait. Heat waves are becoming more frequent globally. But how do we measure heat waves? We explain. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nMask ban goes into effect in Hong Kong, but protesters march on\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam instituted a ban of protesters from wearing masks at rallies that went into effect on Saturday and it appears the ban has caused more problems than it solved. All subway and train services were suspended and shops were closed as protesters marched again Saturday after another night of brutality and destruction. Lam called Saturday \"a very dark day\" and described Hong Kong as \"semi-paralyzed\" and in the grips of \"unprecedented violence.\" She insisted the measure and her use of rarely deployed emergency powers to introduce it without legislative approval were not at the behest of the Chinese government. But pro-democracy residents of Hong Kong have long accused China of slowly encroaching on their rights and a government proposal to change extradition laws to allow suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to mainland China to face trial ignited months of massive protests this year.\n\nTarget shopping becomes more rewarding\n\nDays after shopping at some Target locations became more magical because of new Disney stores opening, it\u2019s becoming more rewarding.

USA TODAY\n\nFlorida and Auburn meet in first part of 'Triangle of Doom' round-robin\n\nCollege football's Southeastern Conference is filled with a staggering number of good-to-elite teams this season and the proof is in the Amway Coaches Poll where five of the top eight squads (No. 1 Alabama; No. 3 Georgia; No. 6 Louisiana State; No. 7 Auburn and No. 8 Florida) are all powerhouses with impressive pedigrees. But only two teams can play in the conference championship game in Atlanta on Dec. 7 and we'll start getting a clearer picture of the teams that may end up there on Saturday when Auburn travels to Gainesville to take on Florida in the first game of a three-week, three-team unofficial round-robin tournament for conference superiority. Next week, Florida is at LSU. Two weeks after that, Auburn visits Baton Rouge. The three teams may knock one another out of SEC title contention. But if one of those teams escapes with a 2-0 record, the winner will be in a great position going into the final stretch of the season.\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/10/05/us-nkorea-nuclear-talks-weather-south-5-things-know-weekend/3829617002/", "description": "Nuclear talks are set to resume for the U.S. and N.
