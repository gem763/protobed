REUTERS/Toru Hanai/Files\n\nGlobal equity markets also received a lift after the Chinese central bank\u2019s move on Friday to cut how much cash banks must hold in reserve, releasing liquidity to shore up an economy hit by the Sino-U.S. trade conflict.\n\nMSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.2%. The Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.6%.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s KOSPI rose 0.6% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei advanced 0.5%.\n\nTracking the cautious optimism in Asia, the pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures was up 0.1%, German DAX futures added 0.25% and Britain\u2019s FTSE futures gained 0.3% in early European trade.\n\nUnderlining the need for more stimulus, data on Sunday showed China\u2019s exports unexpectedly fell in August as shipments to the United States plummeted.\n\nRisk sentiment was also fortified as Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell said on Friday that the central bank would continue to act \u201cas appropriate\u201d to sustain economic expansion in the world\u2019s biggest economy.\n\nBroader stock market gains were tempered by lacklustre economic data - U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in August - although even this was seen as a positive factor for equities if it prompted more policy support measures.\n\n\u201cEquities usually respond negatively to soft data. But the fact that the U.S. jobs report shows the market is banking on stimulus, expecting the Fed to respond to economic weakness with rate cuts,\u201d said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management.\n\nBuoying market confidence on Monday were expectations that the European Central Bank would cut interest rates on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe equity markets will receive a further lift and consolidate their recent gains if they can confirm the ECB\u2019s dovish stance,\u201d Ichikawa at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management said.\n\nThe dollar was capped as U.S. yields came off two-week highs after Friday\u2019s soft U.S. jobs report also raised expectations for a Fed rate cut.\n\nThe greenback traded at 106.890 yen, off the one-month peak of 107.235 scaled late last week.\n\nThe euro was steady at $1.1027, weighed down ahead of Thursday\u2019s ECB policy decision and near a 28-month low of $1.0926 set last week.\n\nThe Australian dollar, sensitive to shifts in broader risk appetite, hovered near a five-week peak of $0.6862 set on Friday.\n\nThe pound was little changed at $1.2277. Sterling has bounced from a three-year low set a week ago as the threat of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal on Oct. 31 was seen to diminish.\n\nBut political uncertainty remains, preventing the pound from regaining further ground. British lawmakers will on Monday vote on whether to hold an early election.\n\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasury yield had bounced to a two-week high of 1.6080% on Friday as risk aversion which engulfed global markets at the start of last week eased. But it was last at 1.5650% and creeping back towards to a three-year low of 1.4290% set on Sept. 3.\n\nInvestors look at screens showing stock information at a brokerage house in Shanghai, China May 6, 2019.

Data on Monday showed Japanese investors in July were largest net buyers of U.S. bonds in three years, with the appeal of European bonds diminishing due to their negative yields.\n\n\u201cThe attraction of U.S. bonds has diminished since the start of the year. But U.S. bonds still remain the highest yielding within industrialised economies,\u201d said Kenta Inoue, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.\n\nBrent crude oil futures gained 1% to $62.14 per barrel after Saudi Arabia signalled that production cuts will continue under a new energy minister.", "description": "Asian stocks edged higher on Monday amid a cautious mood as investors pinned their hopes on expected global stimulus to support slowing growth in the world's major economies.", "authors": ["Shinichi Saoshiro", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427792628&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8805C", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
