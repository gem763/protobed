Instead, it can help with anxiety, depression, insomnia, and even muscle pains.\n\nToast recommends mixing its CBD oil into one's coffee, drinks, smoothies, cocktails, or underneath the tongue in order to experience the benefits.\n\nBesides the pumpkin flavor, the company also provides other fall scents including one in cinnamon.\n\nMore flavors: The company also includes other fall flavors including cinnamon\n\nGroundbreaking: Recently, Toast announced its own line of CBD oil for dogs and cats\n\nToast also recently expanded its CBD line to include calming Toast Miau and Toast Woef products for animals. Specifically formulated for pets, they are a blend of full-spectrum hemp oil with wild anchovy oil, flaxseed oil and Alaskan salmon oil for added health benefits.\n\nThe company decided to release a CBD line for people's dogs and cats as it is estimated 30 to 40 per cent of animals suffer from anxiety, according to research from American Veterinary Medical Association.\n\nTHE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THC AND CBD Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are both derived from the cannabis plant. Together, they are part of the cannabinoid group of compounds found in hashish, hash oil, and most strains of marijuana. THC is the psychoactive compound responsible for the euphoric, 'high' feeling often associated with marijuana. THC interacts with CB1 receptors in the central nervous system and brain and creates the sensations of euphoria and anxiety. CBD does not fit these receptors well, and actually decreases the effects of THC, and is not psychoactive. CBD is thought to help reduce anxiety and inflammation.\n\nTo coincide with the launch of the new pet-specific products, Toast has set up a thunderstorm hotline.\n\nThe company revealed that thunder and lightning are a major source of anxiety for animals. The next time a bout of thunderstorms occurs, they have instructed pet owners to email thunderstorm@toastwellness.com and they will receive a free bottle of Toast Woef or Miau.\n\nToast is not the only company to release innovative CBD items in recent weeks as the product grows more and more popular with consumers.\n\nA clothing company recently launched an activewear line for women with CBD encapsulated into the fabric.\n\nAcabada created its line of CBD-infused workout clothing after noticing the benefits people were experiencing when using the item in products ranging from skincare to food.\n\nThe company claims it used 'cutting-edge technology' called micro-encapsulation where the CBD is encapsulated in a protective polymer coating. This coating allegedly protects the CBD from being damaged by 'evaporation, oxidation and contamination.'\n\nFriction created between the skin and the fabric then releases the CBD slowly onto specific muscle groups, the company claims.\n\nNew concept: Acabada is a New York City-based clothing company that recently launched an activewear line for women infused with CBD\n\nCBD beauty: American Eagle just introduced a range of hemp-infused bath and body products\n\nIt is then up to the user on if they experience any added benefits from using the CBD oil or wearing the products.\n\nAmerican Eagle also just introduced its own gender neutral CBD-based wellness brand, Mood, which offers a collection of 45 hemp-infused bath and body products, including lip balm, hand cream, and face wash.\n\n'Inspired by our customers and their interest in this exciting new category, we see this as a perfect extension of the AE brand,' Chad Kessler, American Eagle Global Brand President, said.\n\n'Mood is designed to help everyone, especially young people, live a better quality of life. The first collection is just the beginning of a more expansive product line and what we see as a meaningful long-term growth opportunity.'\n\nThe brand includes six different scents across its products, which it says are targeted at helping the 'mind, body, and identity'.\n\nThese include Chill, a 'warm vanilla for those grrr moments', Energized, which is 'mandarin nectar to help when you're feeling tired', and zZz, a lavender fragrance 'to combat restlessness'.", "description": "Aspen-based cannabis brand Toast has unveiled a pumpkin spiced-flavored CBD oil for consumers costing $55.", "authors": ["Danielle Zoellner For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/22/19608588-0-image-a-58_1570828751527.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
