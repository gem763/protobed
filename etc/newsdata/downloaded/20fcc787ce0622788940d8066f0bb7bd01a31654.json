Check. Moral compromises? Check. Emotionally nuanced endings? Check. By any reasonable measure, \u201cNeo Cab\u201d is the most captivating video game noir that\u2019s drifted into my life in the Trump era. This visual novel, set in the futuristic city of Los Ojos, delivers a smart, socially-conscious tale about a woman trying to scratch out a living as a taxi driver in a gig economy that\u2019s tilted against her. \u201cNeo Cab\u2019s\u201d vision of a future in which technology has become even more physically invasive is imaginatively persuasive and packs the punch of a classic science-fiction warning \u2014 heads up, big data is coming to get you.\n\nLina is a driver for Neo Cab, an app-based taxi company. Almost broke and hankering to start a new chapter in her life she moves to Los Ojos at the invitation of her friend Savy. In L.O., she chafes at the domination of Capra, a tech company whose driverless cars dominate the streets. Lina once worked for Capra until she and everyone like herself were downsized when the company updated its cars so they would run on a driverless network.\n\n\n\nNeo Cab (Fellow Traveler)\n\nSoon after Lina gets to town she gives Savy a lift. She doesn\u2019t get much time to catch up with her friend who is eager to get to an engagement. Savy makes Lina drop her off a few blocks from where she is going because she doesn\u2019t want the people she is meeting to think of her as \u201cpro-car.\u201d As Lina later comes to find out, Savy is involved with a grass roots political faction in Los Ojos that contends that all cars, whether human operated or driverless, are \u201cdeath machines.\u201d To their way of thinking, cars are unnecessarily dangerous vehicles that would be better replaced by public transportation or biking. Before Savy \u2014 the story\u2019s the femme fatale \u2014 disappears on Lina, she gives her a Feelgrid bracelet. Feelgrids are a line of wearable tech that reflect your emotional state to the world by reading your blood flow. So, when Lina is feeling depressed, her Feelfgrid lights up blue. When she is angry it turns red, when elated, yellow, when content, green.\n\nConversational options are tied to Lina\u2019s emotional state. If she isn\u2019t already in the red, for example, she won\u2019t be able to say something that registers as angry even if there might be ample reason for her to say something cutting. If you select a response that doesn\u2019t jibe with her emotional state a rationalization will appear on the screen to explain away her aversion. By pushing Lina into certain emotional states assorted conversation branches become available.\n\n\n\nNeo Cab (Fellow Traveler)\n\nLina is affected by a number of variables such as who she picks up, the conversations she has with her passengers, where she decides to crash for the night and how well she sleeps. Capra, the company that Lina loathes, offers the cheapest rooms for one-night stays, but I never had Lina stay in any because the savings didn\u2019t seem worth risking her mental well-being. Instead, I generally had Lina stay at a cheap motel where the quality of her rest varied. Once, I let one of Lina\u2019s passengers con another guy out of some money by steering her away from interceding. The guy was a well-heeled jerk and guiding Lina to tears of joy at the prospect of spending the night in a cozy room was totally worth it. In video games, I\u2019m happy to wage a little class warfare when I can.\n\n\n\nNeo Cab (Fellow Traveler)\n\n\u201cNeo Cab\u2019s\u201d narrative neatly wraps itself around the ethics of biofeedback monitoring by considering how an unethical corporation might leverage such data for its benefit. The game also cleverly weaves in a subplot involving one of Lina\u2019s passengers, a \u201cquantum statistician,\u201d who dedicates herself to exploring divergent timelines spread across parallel universes. I found myself so taken in with the statistician\u2019s story that at a certain point I felt a metaphysical chill creep over me as I dithered between choosing different options. The statistician\u2019s words made me idly entertain the possibility that in another dimension I might be choosing my responses differently. Considering that the game is interested in the concept of suggestibility, I commend the developers for pulling off one good narrative beat after another.\n\nI loved \u201cNeo Cab\u2019s\u201d story, characters, and simple though thoughtful game mechanics. Emphatically, this is a ride worth catching.\n\nChristopher Byrd is a Brooklyn-based writer. His work has appeared in the New York Times Book Review, the New Yorker and elsewhere.
