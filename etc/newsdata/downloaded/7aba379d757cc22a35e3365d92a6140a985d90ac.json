The 47-year-old is expected to appear in an Ottawa courtroom this afternoon.\n\nA source tells CBC News that because Ortis' work was so central to national security, federal departments across government are conducting in-house damage assessments in the wake of his arrest.\n\nSources also say multiple security agencies were involved with the arrest.\n\nOrtis is known for his expertise in East Asian affairs, critical infrastructure and the use of \"bots\" online.\n\nHe was charged under a section of the Security of Information Act that applies to individuals \"permanently bound to secrecy\" as a condition of their work \u2014 which strongly suggests he had access to top secret material.\n\nUnder the Security of Information Act, Ortis has also been charged with:\n\nUnauthorized communication of special operational information.\n\nPreparing for the commission of an offence by obtaining or gaining access to information, or possessing any device, apparatus or software used for concealing, surreptitiously communicating or obtaining information.\n\nUnder the Criminal Code, Ortis has been charged with:\n\nBreach of trust by a public officer.\n\nUnauthorized use of a computer, which can include obtaining a computer service through an electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device, and intercepting or causing to be intercepted any function of a computer system.
