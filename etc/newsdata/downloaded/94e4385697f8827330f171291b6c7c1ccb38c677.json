Victor the cameraman eagle soars over the Alps with a GoPro on his back to catalogue the impact of temperature rise on Western Europe\u2019s highest mountain range. But the Eagle Wings Foundation, who organizes Victor's flights, also hopes that the videos will inspire people to care more about the environment.\n\n\u201cWe want to raise attention about climate change,\u201d Ronald Menzel told ABC News. \u201cGlaciers are disappearing. We know that in 100 years we\u2019re not going to have any glaciers in the Alps.\u201d\n\nNomi Baumgartl/Eagle Wings Foundation/Chopard\n\nMenzel is one of the co-founders of the Eagle Wings Foundation, a project that combines photos, video and satellite imagery to document humankind\u2019s effect on the planet. \u201cThis project talks about the impact of climate change on the Alps, in a very original way,\u201d he says.\n\nVictor is a nine-year-old white tailed eagle. He was raised in captivity and trained by his owner Jacques-Olivier Travers who first had the idea to strap a GoPro to his back.\n\nAfter a quick snack Victor glides down the mountain side, hugging the contours of the terrain and taking advantage of air currents that lift him and aid his flight. He is held by falconer Eva Meyrier on the mountainside at the Plan de l\u2019Aiguille and flies the four kilometres to Jacques-Olivier Travers down in the town of Chamonix as soon as he spots him. Victor arrives at the bottom in just over four minutes.\n\nNomi Baumgartl/Eagle Wings Foundation/Chopard\n\nEagles have excellent eye sight but four kilometres is Victor\u2019s limit, Meyrier explains to ABC News. \u201cWe did so many flights with different lengths,\u201d she says, that \u201cyou can tell when Victor doesn\u2019t see Jacques-Olivier anymore and it\u2019s more or less 4 km.\u201d Travers always wears orange, and he always stands in an orange target, in a green field, which Victor has been taught to recognise. When he flies greater distances than for kilometres, Victor aims for a green field, knowing that he will find his handler there.\n\nEagles are intelligent, they really learn. Once, says Meyrier, he landed in the Chamonix golf course \u2013 the first green space he saw. \u201cHe was waiting next to the road \u2026 it\u2019s something not normal for an eagle, but he has learned that somebody will pick him up!\u201d\n\nNomi Baumgartl/Eagle Wings Foundation/Chopard\n\n\u201cVictor is the perfect ambassador,\u201d says Menzel, as he shows how beautiful the planet is from a unique point of view. \u201cWe want to use these amazing images to show the world how beautiful it is and that it\u2019s worth doing things to preserve this environment,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe have to act right now so that the changes do not become totally irreversible.\u201d\n\nData shows that the average global temperature has increased by 0.8 degrees centigrade. But in the Alps overall the temperature has increased by 1.5 centigrade. And at Mont Blanc, says Menzel, it\u2019s 2 degrees. \u201cClimate change is affecting the Alps much more than the rest of Europe. Places that have more extreme climates see a bigger impact. The Alps are experiencing changes that are really dramatic.\u201d\n\nWe are already seeing glacier shrinkage, and alpine wildlife is losing habitat \u2013 including the habitat of white tailed eagles like Victor. Humans should take note too, and not only those who live within a risk zone of crumbling glaciers.\n\n\u201cEveryone unanimously agrees that mountains are so beautiful,\u201d said Dr. Jan Beutel a researcher at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, talking to ABC News. But they are also a vital water supply around the world. \u201cThe Alps represent the \u2018water tower\u2019 of Europe and form the watershed of the Mediterranean Sea, the North Sea/North Atlantic Ocean, and the Black Sea\u201d according to the World Glacier Monitoring Service. And not just the Alps; all the water that comes from the Rocky Mountains is fed from glaciers, Beutel explains. Without glaciers, people have to rely on rain only. \u201cYou live in Kansas and you don\u2019t think you have anything to do with mountains,\u201d he says. \"But it\u2019s all connected.\"", "description": "Victor the cameraman eagle soars over the Alps with a GoPro on his back to catalogue the impact of temperature rise on Western Europe\u2019s highest mountain range.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/eagle-wings-bird-ht-ps-191022_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
