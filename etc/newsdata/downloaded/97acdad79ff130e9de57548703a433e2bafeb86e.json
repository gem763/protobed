Their team tried to calm their supporters down, they tried their best and they supported us \u2014 they said 'if you're walking off we're walking off with you. I took the decision to take my team off and I don't want Yeovil Town to get punished for it. If we get thrown out of the FA Cup and they go through, there is no hard feelings there.\"\n\nThe incident comes four days after England's European Championship qualifier in Bulgaria was stopped twice in the first half as home fans hurled racial abuse at England's black players. However, England decided to play on and won 6-0.\n\nIn a statement ont Twitter, the football anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out praised the \"swift and decisive action\" taken by the Haringey manager Tom Loizou and his players.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
