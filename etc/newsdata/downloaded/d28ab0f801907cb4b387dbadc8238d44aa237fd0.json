The Black Mirror: Bandersnatch and Maze Runner star has been cast in an undisclosed role according to the all-knowing teams at Variety, Deadline, and The Hollywood Reporter. So I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a done deal.\n\nNothing else is known about Poulter\u2019s role but fans seem to have given him the nod of approval.\n\nHere's an Elrond faceswap with Will Poulter on the left and Hugo Weaving on the right pic.twitter.com/kPCM36wfQK \u2014 Jacob Oller (@JacobOller) September 4, 2019\n\nIn July, Aussie actor Markella Kavenagh (Romper Stomper) became the first star to cop the \u201cin talks\u201d treatment for a role in the series. At the time, Variety\u2019s sources said she would be playing a character named Tyra, but not much else is known.\n\nAs you can tell details on ground are thin as hell but we\u2019re slowly getting there. In July Amazon unveiled the show\u2019s creative team with J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay as the showrunners. The Star Trek 4 writers don\u2019t actually have any previous experience as showrunners but, uh, they\u2019ve got a really experienced team.\n\nGennifer Hutchinson (Better Call Saul, Breaking Bad), Helen Shang (13 Reasons Why, Hannibal), Jason Cahill (Halt and Catch Fire, The Sopranos, ER) Justin Doble (Stranger Things, Fringe), Stephany Folson (Toy Story 4), and Bryan Cogman (Game of Thrones writer) are all on the writing team.\n\nJ.A. Bayona, whose directing credits include The Impossible, The Orphanage, A Monster Calls, and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, will helm episodes 1 and 2.\n\nAmazon has also brought in Ron Ames (The Aviator, The Departed, Star Trek Into Darkness, Avengers: Age of Ultron) as co-producer. Kate Hawley (Crimson Peak, Edge of Tomorrow, and Suicide Squad) is set to design costume and Academy Award winner Ricky Heinrichs will serve as the production designer. He has worked on Sleepy Hollow, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man\u2019s Chest, and Star Wars: The Last Jedi.\n\nJohn Howe, of the original Lord of the Rings film trilogy, will return as the illustrator / concept artist. And Tom Shippey has signed on as the Tolkien Scholar.\n\nA little while ago Shippey said \u201cthere are supposed to be 20 episodes for the first season\u201d so make of that what you will.\n\nFor the full creative team, watch the below.\n\nMeet our Fellowship. pic.twitter.com/Npouu6ZlRt \u2014 The Lord of the Rings on Prime (@LOTRonPrime) July 27, 2019", "description": "Amazon's humongous\u00a0Lord of the Rings\u00a0series has found one of its lead actors in the form of Midsommar actor Will Poulter.", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-504387698-1024x680.jpg"}
