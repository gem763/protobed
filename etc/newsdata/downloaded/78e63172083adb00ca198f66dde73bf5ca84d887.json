The Lithuania goalkeeper got his hand to it, but it hit his head and bounced into the net.\n\nThree minutes later, Ronaldo was left free in the area to sweep home Bernardo Silva\u2019s cross and Silva also provided the pass for Ronaldo to sidefoot his fourth 11 minutes later.\n\nCarvalho\u2019s goal, his fourth in 60 games, was a fitting reward for a player who keeps the Portugal midfield ticking over without getting much attention.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced that these players are capable of finishing top of this group,\u201d said Santos.\n\nAleksandar Mitrovic scored twice to keep Serbia\u2019s hopes alive with a win in Luxemburg. He headed Serbia in front after 36 minutes and Nemanja Radonjic curled in the second 10 minutes after the restart.\n\nSubstitute David Turpel pulled one back and Serbia were on the ropes until Sergej Milinkovic-Savic produced a delightful reverse pass for Mitrovic to fire in the third.", "description": "Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo took his international tally to 93 goals when he scored four times to give the European champions a 5-1 win away to Lithuania in their Euro 2020 qualifier on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428466151&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF89263", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
