REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Super Mario is running circles around a Japanese rival. The iconic plumber\u2019s mobile racing hit has helped power up shares of Nintendo by almost 30% this year. Its richer valuation also intensifies the pressure on Sony, which is facing calls to reduce its sprawl. Nintendo has been on an impressive winning streak. Its recently released \u201cMario Kart Tour\u201d racked up more than 90 million downloads in its first week, industry tracker Sensor Tower estimates. Moreover, a new and smaller version of the popular Switch console, as well as a tie-up with Chinese titan Tencent to enter the world\u2019s largest gaming market, should give a boost to Nintendo\u2019s quarterly results due Thursday. Operating profit in the three months to September is expected to rocket up 65% from a year earlier, to 51 billion yen, or $470 million, according to the average of analyst estimates gathered by Refinitiv. That puts $75 billion Sony in danger of falling further behind its nimbler and more focused rival. Nintendo trades at 18 times anticipated earnings for the next 12 months. Sony, by comparison fetches only about 14 times, weighed down by its lower-valued TV, smartphone and camera businesses, as well as a conglomerate discount. Sony boss Kenichiro Yoshida has been reluctant to break up the company.
