But in a political season in which Democratic candidates for president have more to say on saving the planet for future generations than on the practice of ending those generations in the womb, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard Tulsi GabbardWatch live: 2020 Democrats speak at criminal justice forum Mark Zuckerberg deserves praise for his noble stand on free speech The Hill's 12:30 Report \u2014 Presented by Nareit \u2014 State of the states: Political fights heat up MORE (D-Hawaii) has some advice for my family's former party that Democrats really should consider if they want to win.\n\nAt last week\u2019s Democratic debate, Gabbard has had the nerve to state the obvious; that abortions in the third trimesters when preborn babies can feel pain, when the risks to women dramatically rises, and as babies can live outside the womb should be curtailed. While she stated her overall support for abortion, Gabbard said that she did not believe limitless abortion should be the goal.\n\n\u201cI do, however, think that there should be some restrictions in place,\u201d she said. \u201cI support codifying Roe v. Wade \u2014 while making sure that, during the third trimester, abortion is not an option unless the life or severe health consequences of a woman are at risk.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\nAnd just in case you think that only pro-life Americans would agree, consider that Dr. Leanna Wen, the former president of Planned Parenthood, tweeted her support: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with @TulsiGabbard on a lot, but do appreciate that she brought up the third rail for Democrats: that abortion should be \u2018safe, legal, and rare,\u2019\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe should reduce the need for abortions by investing in prevention.\u201d\n\nHonestly, if Democrats were smart, they would listen to Gabbard and not ignore her.\n\nWhile what she proposed, limiting only third trimester abortions, is not enough, it\u2019s a place to start. The policy would be seen as a realistic compromise blue collar Democrats could get behind.\n\nBut sadly, the Democratic Party has already been bought and paid for by Planned Parenthood and the rest of the abortion lobby, so Gabbard won\u2019t get the attention or money from the powerhouse Democratic Party donors.\n\nHowever, if they were looking at swing state demographics, the Democrats would adopt this view, re-embrace \u201csafe, legal and rare,\u201d as Gabbard recommends, and try to appear as compromisers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe abortion extremist rhetoric that celebrates abortion even post-birth, infanticide for babies born during an abortion, appeals to almost no one, despite the cheers in New York for abortion through all 9 months or the platitudes of Virginia\u2019s Governor who wants babies to be comfortable as they die.\n\nVoter in the rustbelt, in the heartland, and in the parts of America sometimes sneeringly called fly-over country, don\u2019t see abortion, as do Democratic Party operatives.\n\nSince 2016, the Democratic Party platform supports abortion through all 9 months, for any reason at all, and with taxpayer subsidies. In fact, buried in the \u201cMedicare for all\u201d mantra repeated by many presidential contenders is the goal of full-abortion funding.\n\nPolls repeatedly show that Americans support abortion limits and don\u2019t want to pay for abortions with tax dollars. A Marist poll earlier this year found that 3 out of 4 Americans would limit abortion to the first three months of pregnancy. Almost two-thirds in that same poll believe that the Supreme Court should allow limits on abortion. Also in SFLA\u2019s polls, 65 percent of Millennial wanted to vote on abortion-related policy, rather than leaving it in the hands of a few judges.\n\nBut rather than trying to make common cause with the majority of Americas, the current Democratic debate showed just how extreme the party has gone with the candidates endorsing a number of proposals to push the limits of abortion, including packing the Supreme Court with more abortion-supporting justices, putting the extremism of Roe into law, expanding the government\u2019s advocacy for abortion through tools like an Office of Reproductive Freedom and Reproductive Rights and opposing the rights of voters to pass abortion laws at the state level.\n\nWhere does it end? As politicians nationwide ask for votes in 2020, I hope the electorate will ask them to take the Tulsa Challenge.\n\nCandidates should be asked what abortions they would limit. Where do they draw the line? Do they oppose aborting viable babies, infants targeted because of their sex or genetics, infanticide for babies born during abortion, full-taxpayer funding of abortion, or forcing abortion into citizen\u2019s health-care policies? Do they support conscience protections for health-care workers who don\u2019t want to end pre-born lives or for Americans who don\u2019t want to fund life-ending drugs or abortions?\n\nSo far, only Gabbard has been brave enough to tell America what she thinks. It\u2019s time to know where all candidates stand on the human rights issue of our day.\n\nKristan Hawkins is president of Students for Life of America, with more than 1,220 groups on college, university and high school campuses in all 50 states.
