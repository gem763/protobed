The hashtag continues to inspire women around the world to share photos on social media of their breasts which don\u2019t necessarily adhere to widely accepted unrealistic beauty standards. \u2018Success is being able to look at yourself and not compare yourself to idols, or predefined goals,\u2019 she says. \u2018It is looking at what you have achieved and needing no other validation than a smile from yourself in the mirror.\u2019 The writer is also the brains behind the #BlockHimParty hashtag \u2013 encouraging women to celebrate their independence and block \u201cemotional unavailable\u201d men \u2013 and written a book titled \u2018What a Time to Be Alone\u2019, about female self-acceptance. \u2018Be the most exciting and daring you can be. Tear the walls down - decide that you are enough,\u2019 she advises. 2/29 Katharine Hamnett CBE, fashion designer A graduate from Saint Martin\u2019s School of Art, Hamnett founded her eponymous clothing line in 1979. Over the years, she has become renowned for sustainable fashion and political T-shirts. In 1983, George Michael wore one of her designs \u2013 a white T-shirt with the phrase 'Choose Love!' emblazoned on the front - in the music video for 'Wake Me Up Before You Go Go'. Her T-shirts have also been worn by members of the band Queen and model Naomi Campbell. When it comes to achieving success in your career, Hamnett advises: 'Find a gap in the market that you think you can fill. Don\u2019t compromise. Only make things you would kill for yourself. If you want them, then so will everybody else.' She also suggests remembering what you wanted to do with your life when you were 10-years-old. 'We always underestimate how clear sighted and wise we were when we were young. Better to be a failure on your own terms than a success on somebody else\u2019s.' Getty Images for The Business of 3/29 Gena-mour Barrett, freelance writer and journalist Recently named on the Forbes 2019 '30 Under 30' media and marketing list in Europe, Barrett should definitely be on your radar this year. Over the years, the journalist has been on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour, BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast and written for publications such as Buzzfeed and ELLE UK. Perseverance, consistency, and a touch of fearlessness, she says, are key components to finding success. 'I constantly tell myself \"it's a marathon, not a sprint\" so I'm competitive but I like to be tactical in my approach,' she explains. 'The key is to keep going and have the courage to do so, even in the face of possible failure.' As someone who has faced challenges during her career, she says: 'I know it's easier said than done, and I'm prone to being really hard on myself, but I try to take the rough with the smooth and speak to myself as I would a friend. Social media makes it difficult not to compare yourself to other people, but stay tunnel visioned on your own goal and be patient.' Laura Gallant 4/29 Gina Martin, writer and activist Following an 18-month campaign to make 'upskirting' - the act of taking a photograph underneath another person\u2019s clothing without their knowledge or consent - illegal, activist Gina Martin succeeded in her mission in January. Her tireless efforts to change the law came to show a generation of young women just how powerful their voice can be. Her top tip for success? 'Not seeing it as success but seeing it as progress,' she says. 'Don't look for that big perfect end goal, just stay focused on doing your best and pushing forward.' The 26-year-old also highlights the importance of building a strong support system around you. 'Get rid of anyone who doesn't make you feel supported, respected or who doesn\u2019t prioritise you in their life. They are what get you through the tough times and if they\u2019re the right people you won't feel guilty about needing their support.' Getty Images for Spirit Forward 5/29 Tobi Oredein, journalist and Black Ballad founder Award-wining journalist. Media entrepreneur. International public speaker. These are just a few titles to describe Tobi Oredein. In 2014, the writer launched Black Ballad \u2013 a digital media and lifestyle subscription platform with the aim to tell the human experience through the eyes of black women in Britain. On the subject of success, Oredein says: \u2018If someone tells you no, then you are talking to the wrong person. There is no singular path to success and be sure not to define your success based on what others think it should be.\u2019 Instagram: Tobi Oredein 6/29 Rosie Davies-Smith, founder of the London Fashion Agency (LFA) and PR Dispatch Davies-Smith founded LFA at the age of 25 to offer lifestyle brands a digital alternative to traditional PR. When it comes to success, the entrepreneur believes it derives from three main factors which include 'making a difference to an industry or someone\u2019s live, doing something you love day in day out, and reflecting on how you come otherwise you\u2019ll never appreciate what you have achieved'. In 2016, Rosie won the GB Creative Industries Entrepreneur of the year award. A year later, she launched her second business PR Dispatch which helps small businesses DIY their PR. Her top tip for overcoming challenges? 'Take a deep breath and write everything down,' she suggests. 'When I face challenges I always try and work though them with other people.' She also advises finding the confidence to acknowledge when something isn\u2019t working. 'Be brave enough to take the leap and move on. The fear of the unknown can be terrifying but also exciting,' she notes. LFA 7/29 Amika George, activist and founder of #FreePeriods George launched #FreePeriods campaign in April 2017 after learning that children in the UK were missing school because they were unable to afford menstrual products, also known as \u2018Period Poverty\u2019. The campaign petitions the UK government to give free sanitary products to children on free school meals and has received over 271,000 signatures on change.org. In light of George\u2019s work, UK International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt unveiled a \u00a32 million fund to tackle \u2018period poverty\u2019 around the world earlier this month. \u2018Success comes from knowing that, despite all the odds, you've made things slightly better for someone, no matter how invisible or insignificant that change may seem,\u2019 she says. The 19-year-old adds: \u2018Strength in numbers is vital, especially for those times where it can feel lonely and progress doesn't appear to be coming. Keep going, lean on each other, and tap into the different skills and resources on offer and change will come.\u2019 AFP/Getty Images 8/29 Niomi Smart, lifestyle influencer and entrepreneur At 26, Niomi Smart is already a best-selling author of \u2018Eat Smart\u2019 cookbook, has over 1.6m Instagram followers and collaborations with high-street brand Oasis under her belt. Despite such accolades early on in her career, Smart hasn\u2019t been immune to pitfalls. 'Many challenges have been thrown my way throughout the years, and of course it can be disheartening, but it\u2019s no reason to stop,' she says. The entrepreneur explains that her career has taught her that a sign of success isn\u2019t how long you stay in one job or company. 'I now understand that it can be more beneficial to move, change and evolve,' she says. 'What\u2019s most important is following your heart, gaining the experiences that matter and keeping your mind stimulated.' The influencer also values self-care as an integral part in finding success. 'I\u2019m a huge advocate of practicing some form of self-love everyday such as meditation, yoga or cooking to appreciate our bodies and learn to respect ourselves,' she suggests. Stuart C. Wilson/Getty Images 9/29 Mollie Hughes, Mount Everest record-breaking adventurer In 2017, aged 26, Mollie became the world\u2019s youngest person to have successfully climbed both the north and south sides of Mount Everest, the world\u2019s highest peak. Now, the Edinburgh-based adventurer and motivational speaker plans to become the youngest woman in the world to ski solo and unsupported to the South Pole in November. As a result, it\u2019s safe to say Hughes knows a thing or two when it comes to overcoming adversity. 'You need to convince yourself that you can and visualise yourself succeeding,' she says. 'Focus on succeeding in something you love and are passionate about. If your ambition means everything to you, work will never feel like work, you will be unwaveringly committed and most likely succeed.' Mollie Hughes 10/29 Sherrille Riley, owner of Nails and Brows in Mayfair Jamaican-born Riley launched luxury nail and brow styling boutique Nails & Brows Mayfair in 2014 after two decades working as a beautician in London. In 2017, Riley launched a collection of brow styling solutions (think pigmented brow pencils and highlighters) which has been featured in Vogue, Harper\u2019s Bazaar and the Sunday Times. Reflecting on what makes an entrepreneur successful, the businesswoman says: 'Your passion will provide you with the drive that will inevitably lead you to success. An old saying I\u2019ve always kept with me is \"if you want to get dusty, stand under a windmill\".' To overcome challenges, Riley warns: 'Don\u2019t panic, there will always be challenges. I tend to think of challenges like jigsaw puzzles. You just need a calm mind in order to work out how all of the pieces will \ufb01t together.' 11/29 Laura Haynes, Chair Emeritus of UN Women National Committee The native New Yorker became co-chair of UN Women UK in September after assisting in the organisation\u2019s initial strategic planning. Representing UN Women in the UK, Haynes and her team are on a mission to promote gender equality and empower women and young girls around the world through partnership, advocacy and fundraising. When it comes to one's career, she suggests always thinking about what makes you happy. 'Life does not run in a straight line (wouldn\u2019t that be boring?), so follow new opportunities to give, and take, the best you can,' she says. If you want to find success, Haynes warns it\u2019s important to first recognise your strengths. 'Remember that there is potential in everything you do,' she adds. 'Listen and learn, but also share. Be generous - give your ideas away and continue to strive for better. You do not need to follow anyone else\u2019s way of doing things, you need to find your own.' Getty Images for Spirit Forward 12/29 Malaika and Anoushay Butt, co-owners of Wafflestick The brainchild of two childhood friends with a shared love of sweet treats, street food dessert business Wafflestick began in 2017. Within the first six months of launching their company, the pair were asked to cater to a film crew of a Disney film, and have since teamed up with Facebook and Secret Cinema. In December 2018, the duo launched their second street food business, Baba Dhaba. 'Get out of your comfort zone, and throw yourself in the deep end - hand that notice in!' says Malaika. 'It will push you to succeed and to look for new opportunities that will give you purpose. Don\u2019t work aimlessly, write a plan. We chose to write a five-year plan both for our personal lives and for the businesses, and then created another short term plan for the coming year, it can also be for the weeks or months ahead.' 13/29 Isabel Garvey, MD, Abbey Road Studios With arguably one of the coolest jobs in the music industry, Garvey joined Abbey Road Studios in 2014 with the task of implementing the largest investment in the Studios since its opening in 1931. From building new studio spaces and creating new revenue streams, the businesswoman admits she\u2019s learned that things go wrong but it\u2019s important to 'learn quickly and move on. 'My father (who has four daughters) always had the mantra \"take the emotion out of the situation\" which has taught me not to take things personally and to try and look at every situation objectively.\" As for reaching out for help, she says it\u2019s important to trust your gut but also those you believe in. 'Seek advice and find people who will help champion your career,' she advises. 'I think, particularly as a woman, it important to have male (as well as female) mentors as they have valuable insight on how to navigate the corporate world.' Jill Furmanovsky 14/29 Liz Johnson, gold medal Paralympian You\u2019ll best know Johnson as a former Team GB Paralympian who won a gold medal in the 2008 Beijing Olympics just days after losing her mother. In the years since, she has worked as a Channel 4 pundit during the Rio 2016 Games, graduated as an accountant, and co-founded The Ability People, an employment agency staffed only by people with disabilities. Last year, she was recognised as one of the BBC\u2019s 100 Women 2018. When it comes to fulfilling your goals, Johnson says: 'Allow yourself time to step back and process everything so you can be confident you\u2019re making the right decisions. Stepping back gives you the perspective you need to think of alternatives and solutions to the problems you face.' If you find yourself doubting your career, 'the key question to ask yourself is if you still fundamentally enjoy what you\u2019re doing and the field you\u2019re in', she says. Amy Mace 15/29 Michelle Kennedy, CEO & Founder of Peanut 'You make your own success!' says former Badoo deputy CEO Michelle Kennedy. In 2017, Kennedy co-founded mothers networking app Peanut - a global community of over 500,000 women who happen to be mothers and want to connect with like-minded individuals. Kennedy advises defining what success means to you. 'That takes some soul searching, and critical analysis about what is motivating you,' she explains. 'Once you know what success looks like to you, you can go after it.' Having started her career as a lawyer before moving into the technology field, the CEO knows all too well that it\u2019s never too late to make a change when it comes to developing your skills. 'It's all about planning,' she advises. 'If you're feeling stuck, think about what you'd like to do, the steps it will take to get there (work backwards), and then make a plan. That might mean trying to save, that might mean milestones over a certain period.' 16/29 Lavinia Davolio, founder of luxury Italian confectionery business Lavolio Davolio launched her business in 2013 with no external funding and just a team of five people. Over the years, the company has grown exponentially and now supplies the likes of Fortnum & Mason and the V&A. When you encounter problems in business, Davolio says you should never be afraid to learn. 'I created Lavolio out of the adversity of losing my job in banking,' she says. 'In the beginning, almost everything was done out of my kitchen table.' From selling her products at markets to learning how to understand business plans and food laws, the entrepreneur says she continues to learn from other business owners and mentors. 'Different challenges will require you to learn how to tackle tasks you weren\u2019t even aware that existed. For example, I discovered that learning some tricks in how to code improved my e-commerce revenues by 50 per cent,' she adds. 'It gives me the greatest satisfaction to learn something new.' Geoff Pugh 17/29 Christine Telyan, CEO and co-founder of London-based tech company UENI Telyan became inspired to launch UENI in 2014 when tasked with finding a dentist for her husband. On discovering that over 70 per cent of small businesses lacked an online presence, Teylan and her husband set up the company. Five years later, UENI has raised a total of \u00a315m in funding. 'Be ambitious,' Teylan advises women aiming to succeed. 'Whatever it is you set out to do, always set goals which stretch you. Believe in yourself, push the boundaries and always be thinking about the next phase. Ask yourself: \"Where can I be in a year's time?\" It can be really far.' If you feel like you\u2019ve reached a dead end in your career, Teylan suggests: 'Get a lot of advice and don't stay stuck for long. So many people are willing to help and mentor others because they, too, have been helped in their careers, but you need to ask them. Fresh perspectives can give you confidence to approach your current role in a different way or to make the career change you need.' Andrew Hasson 18/29 Emma O\u2019Dell, co-owner of family-run restaurant and bar Acanteen Mother-daughter duo Emma and Brenda launched Acanteen in Chelmsford in 2001 with a vision of selling ethically-produced and sustainably-sourced food. 'My mum taught me never to be afraid to fail and learn from your mistakes,' says Emma. 'One challenge we had when we first opened, was realising that we were missing out on sales because people could only pay in cash,' she explains. 'We looked into a number of new payment provider options and settled on payments technology Square.' Learning how to adapt to change is also invaluable. 'I was made redundant from a really well paid job which at the time sent me into a depression but I dug deep and changed direction completely, redundancy was a blessing in disguise for me,' adds the restaurateur. 19/29 Ella Mills, author and founder of Deliciously Ella Mills is the entrepreneur behind Deliciously Ella, the plant-based brand which started out as a food blog and has since grown into a lifestyle website, series of best-selling recipe books, chain of delis and range of healthy food products. Mills now has over 1.5 million followers on Instagram. \u2018My two biggest tips would be: firstly, find an unwaveringly optimistic attitude, always look for the solution to a problem as quickly as possible rather than dwelling/worrying about the issue \u2013 find a way to lead your team to the answer too,' she says. 'Secondly, recognise your strengths and weaknesses, and bring on a team of people that excel where you\u2019re weakest. Remember than no one is great at everything, there\u2019s no shame in putting your ego to one side and acknowledging where you need help.' 20/29 Sheridan Ash, technology and investment director at PwC and Tech She Can founder Sheridan took an unconventional route into technology - a single mum who left school at 16, worked as a runway model alongside Jerry Hall, and then re-trained and did an MBA, progressing to a director in PwC\u2019s technology team. Ash is also the brains behind the Tech She Can Charter which brings together 18 large organisations, including Tesco, JP Morgan and British Science Association, to take action to increase the number of females taking up technology roles in the UK. 'Don\u2019t beat yourself up,' Ash tells budding entrepreneurs. 'Pretend to be confident, even if you\u2019re not, after a while it becomes part of who you are and you stop having to remind yourself. Take responsibility to make the changes you want to see. Be the ambassador for the world you want to live in and the workplace you want to work in.' 21/29 Michelle Dewberry, broadcaster and businesswoman Dewberry made her mark by winning series two of BBC\u2019s 'The Apprentice'. Today, she continues to work as a business transformation consultant, and uses her own experiences and knowledge to empower CEOs and businesses all over the country. The businesswoman regularly appears on national TV discussing business and politics. \u2018My top success tip is to take action!' she says. 'Action is better than all of the planning in the world. In life or business people can plan all they like, but the longer they take, the more opportunities they will miss.' 22/29 Kara Rosen, founder of Plenish Rosen, previously a director at publishing powerhouse Cond\u00e9 Nast, founded juice and dairy-free nut milk brand Plenish after she began seeking out nutritional advice to replenish her body and build back immunity and energy lost as a result of many years spent running on empty. The brand is now loved by celebrities including Gwyneth Paltrow. \u2018Execute precisely,' she advises. 'There is no escaping execution. In your own business, ideas are 10 per cent of success and execution is 90 per cent at a minimum.' She adds: 'Make sure your ideas are brought to fruition with great care, with attention to detail and with your consumer\u2019s experience in the heart of everything that you do.' 23/29 Rhiannon Lambert, nutritionist and best-selling author Lambert is a leading Harley Street nutritionist specialising in weight management, eating disorders and sports nutrition. Founder of Rhitrition, her private clinic, and author of \u2018Re-Nourish: A Simple Way To Eat Well\u2019, Lambert\u2019s qualified approach to nutrition and total dedication to her clients\u2019 needs has seen Lambert work with some of the world\u2019s most influential people. \u2018Be positive; look for the good in every situation and find the lesson in everything that goes wrong,' she suggests. 'Changing a negative mental attitude to a positive one can result in a completely different lifestyle, both personally and professionally.' 24/29 Hannah Witton, vlogger and author Witton is an award-winning vlogger, author and online creator, with her vlogs attracting more than 45 million unique views on her official YouTube channel. Witton is also regarded as one of the UK\u2019s leading young voices, using her unique blend of positivity, optimism and knowledge to talk about a range of topics including sex, relationships, feminism, body image, gender and sexuality. \u2018Listen to your gut.,' she says. 'Sometimes when you\u2019re torn over a decision, your instinct is the best thing to guide you. Don\u2019t ignore it.' 25/29 Dr Vivian Chan, CEO and co-founder of Sparrho After completing her biochemistry PhD at Cambridge University and working in venture capital, Chan founded Sparrho \u2013 a science research discovery platform \u2013 as a tool to help democratise access to science for people at every level of education across the world. An alumnus of Entrepreneur First, Chan was named one of MIT Tech Review\u2019s 35 Under 35 Innovators and one of the Top 100 Asian Stars in UK Tech in 2017. \u2018Being true to yourself can go a long way: it helps define what kind of leader, team player, mentor, friend you become,' she says. 26/29 Clare Smyth MBE, owner of Core by Clare Smyth, Notting Hill, London Smyth is the debut restaurant of the restaurateur - the first and only female chef to run a restaurant with three Michelin stars in the UK. With appearances on \u2018Saturday Kitchen\u2019, \u2018Great British Menu\u2019, \u2018MasterChef\u2019, \u2018The Late Show\u2019, \u2018The One Show\u2019 and numerous international demos across the world, Smyth is quietly building her own empire. \u2018My tip for success is hard work and dedication above all else, focus on the end goal and don\u2019t cut corners or make excuses,' she says. 27/29 Phoebe Gormley, entrepreneur and founder of Gormley & Gamble Gormley is the founder of Gormley & Gamble, Savile Row\u2019s first-ever women-only tailor. When it comes to business, confidence is key for the designer. She says: \u2018Being in a hugely male-dominated industry, it can often be pretty intimidating, but I try to remember an Eleanor Roosevelt quote: \u2018No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.\u2019 She's also a big advocate of self-care. 'In a 24/7 world we can try to keep up and it can end up being counterproductive,' she notes. 'I personally like to tackle one problem at a time, I forget about things if I have too many mental tabs open at one time. It can be a nightmare trying to balance work, relationships, family time, friends, eating well, exercise, and that damn chair that\u2019s always covered in laundry.' As a result, Gormley says it's important to carve out time for yourself. 'Don\u2019t think of \u201cme time\u201d as a fallback option for when plans fall through, actively make time for it,' she notes. 28/29 Jazmin Sawyers, Team GB athlete Sawyers is a British track and field athlete who won Silver in the long jump at the 2014 Commonwealth Games. The sportswoman also competed in the 2017 series of \u2018The Voice\u2019, successfully achieving Will.i.am as her coach. \u2018I try and keep three things in mind when I\u2019m striving for success in anything,' she explains. 'Am I being consistent? Am I being consistently *excellent*? Am I happy?' she questions herself. 'Consistency and excellence need each other in whatever you\u2019re pursuing, and I believe happiness leads to success, not the other way around!\u2019 29/29 Hilary Stephenson, MD of leading UX design agency Sigma Stephenson originally founded Sigma in 2006 - when the field of UX design was in its infancy \u2013 and has grown the agency substantially since, with the company picking up a string of awards and a global client portfolio, including Sport England, AstraZeneca and the BBC. The entrepreneur has been an outspoken advocate for increasing the number of women in tech, writing extensively on the subject over the years. 'The focus on gender equality and broader diversity inclusion initiatives is still vital,' she notes. 'This is true not only for employers looking to build better, stronger teams, but also to ensure the work they do meets the true needs of their widest possible audience. It just makes good business sense to be both inclusive and representative of what our society looks like.' 1/29 Chidera Eggerue aka The Slumflower, writer and fashion blogger In 2017, fashion blogger Eggerue launched the #SaggyBoobsMatter campaign \u2013 a hashtag to celebrate diversity and challenge the assumption that women with large breasts should wear a bra.

There is no singular path to success and be sure not to define your success based on what others think it should be.\u2019 Instagram: Tobi Oredein 6/29 Rosie Davies-Smith, founder of the London Fashion Agency (LFA) and PR Dispatch Davies-Smith founded LFA at the age of 25 to offer lifestyle brands a digital alternative to traditional PR. When it comes to success, the entrepreneur believes it derives from three main factors which include 'making a difference to an industry or someone\u2019s live, doing something you love day in day out, and reflecting on how you come otherwise you\u2019ll never appreciate what you have achieved'. In 2016, Rosie won the GB Creative Industries Entrepreneur of the year award. A year later, she launched her second business PR Dispatch which helps small businesses DIY their PR. Her top tip for overcoming challenges? 'Take a deep breath and write everything down,' she suggests. 'When I face challenges I always try and work though them with other people.' She also advises finding the confidence to acknowledge when something isn\u2019t working. 'Be brave enough to take the leap and move on. The fear of the unknown can be terrifying but also exciting,' she notes. LFA 7/29 Amika George, activist and founder of #FreePeriods George launched #FreePeriods campaign in April 2017 after learning that children in the UK were missing school because they were unable to afford menstrual products, also known as \u2018Period Poverty\u2019. The campaign petitions the UK government to give free sanitary products to children on free school meals and has received over 271,000 signatures on change.org. In light of George\u2019s work, UK International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt unveiled a \u00a32 million fund to tackle \u2018period poverty\u2019 around the world earlier this month. \u2018Success comes from knowing that, despite all the odds, you've made things slightly better for someone, no matter how invisible or insignificant that change may seem,\u2019 she says. The 19-year-old adds: \u2018Strength in numbers is vital, especially for those times where it can feel lonely and progress doesn't appear to be coming. Keep going, lean on each other, and tap into the different skills and resources on offer and change will come.\u2019 AFP/Getty Images 8/29 Niomi Smart, lifestyle influencer and entrepreneur At 26, Niomi Smart is already a best-selling author of \u2018Eat Smart\u2019 cookbook, has over 1.6m Instagram followers and collaborations with high-street brand Oasis under her belt. Despite such accolades early on in her career, Smart hasn\u2019t been immune to pitfalls. 'Many challenges have been thrown my way throughout the years, and of course it can be disheartening, but it\u2019s no reason to stop,' she says. The entrepreneur explains that her career has taught her that a sign of success isn\u2019t how long you stay in one job or company. 'I now understand that it can be more beneficial to move, change and evolve,' she says. 'What\u2019s most important is following your heart, gaining the experiences that matter and keeping your mind stimulated.' The influencer also values self-care as an integral part in finding success. 'I\u2019m a huge advocate of practicing some form of self-love everyday such as meditation, yoga or cooking to appreciate our bodies and learn to respect ourselves,' she suggests. Stuart C. Wilson/Getty Images 9/29 Mollie Hughes, Mount Everest record-breaking adventurer In 2017, aged 26, Mollie became the world\u2019s youngest person to have successfully climbed both the north and south sides of Mount Everest, the world\u2019s highest peak. Now, the Edinburgh-based adventurer and motivational speaker plans to become the youngest woman in the world to ski solo and unsupported to the South Pole in November. As a result, it\u2019s safe to say Hughes knows a thing or two when it comes to overcoming adversity. 'You need to convince yourself that you can and visualise yourself succeeding,' she says. 'Focus on succeeding in something you love and are passionate about. If your ambition means everything to you, work will never feel like work, you will be unwaveringly committed and most likely succeed.' Mollie Hughes 10/29 Sherrille Riley, owner of Nails and Brows in Mayfair Jamaican-born Riley launched luxury nail and brow styling boutique Nails & Brows Mayfair in 2014 after two decades working as a beautician in London. In 2017, Riley launched a collection of brow styling solutions (think pigmented brow pencils and highlighters) which has been featured in Vogue, Harper\u2019s Bazaar and the Sunday Times. Reflecting on what makes an entrepreneur successful, the businesswoman says: 'Your passion will provide you with the drive that will inevitably lead you to success. An old saying I\u2019ve always kept with me is \"if you want to get dusty, stand under a windmill\".' To overcome challenges, Riley warns: 'Don\u2019t panic, there will always be challenges. I tend to think of challenges like jigsaw puzzles. You just need a calm mind in order to work out how all of the pieces will \ufb01t together.' 11/29 Laura Haynes, Chair Emeritus of UN Women National Committee The native New Yorker became co-chair of UN Women UK in September after assisting in the organisation\u2019s initial strategic planning. Representing UN Women in the UK, Haynes and her team are on a mission to promote gender equality and empower women and young girls around the world through partnership, advocacy and fundraising. When it comes to one's career, she suggests always thinking about what makes you happy. 'Life does not run in a straight line (wouldn\u2019t that be boring?), so follow new opportunities to give, and take, the best you can,' she says. If you want to find success, Haynes warns it\u2019s important to first recognise your strengths. 'Remember that there is potential in everything you do,' she adds. 'Listen and learn, but also share. Be generous - give your ideas away and continue to strive for better. You do not need to follow anyone else\u2019s way of doing things, you need to find your own.' Getty Images for Spirit Forward 12/29 Malaika and Anoushay Butt, co-owners of Wafflestick The brainchild of two childhood friends with a shared love of sweet treats, street food dessert business Wafflestick began in 2017. Within the first six months of launching their company, the pair were asked to cater to a film crew of a Disney film, and have since teamed up with Facebook and Secret Cinema. In December 2018, the duo launched their second street food business, Baba Dhaba. 'Get out of your comfort zone, and throw yourself in the deep end - hand that notice in!' says Malaika. 'It will push you to succeed and to look for new opportunities that will give you purpose. Don\u2019t work aimlessly, write a plan. We chose to write a five-year plan both for our personal lives and for the businesses, and then created another short term plan for the coming year, it can also be for the weeks or months ahead.' 13/29 Isabel Garvey, MD, Abbey Road Studios With arguably one of the coolest jobs in the music industry, Garvey joined Abbey Road Studios in 2014 with the task of implementing the largest investment in the Studios since its opening in 1931. From building new studio spaces and creating new revenue streams, the businesswoman admits she\u2019s learned that things go wrong but it\u2019s important to 'learn quickly and move on. 'My father (who has four daughters) always had the mantra \"take the emotion out of the situation\" which has taught me not to take things personally and to try and look at every situation objectively.\" As for reaching out for help, she says it\u2019s important to trust your gut but also those you believe in. 'Seek advice and find people who will help champion your career,' she advises. 'I think, particularly as a woman, it important to have male (as well as female) mentors as they have valuable insight on how to navigate the corporate world.' Jill Furmanovsky 14/29 Liz Johnson, gold medal Paralympian You\u2019ll best know Johnson as a former Team GB Paralympian who won a gold medal in the 2008 Beijing Olympics just days after losing her mother. In the years since, she has worked as a Channel 4 pundit during the Rio 2016 Games, graduated as an accountant, and co-founded The Ability People, an employment agency staffed only by people with disabilities. Last year, she was recognised as one of the BBC\u2019s 100 Women 2018. When it comes to fulfilling your goals, Johnson says: 'Allow yourself time to step back and process everything so you can be confident you\u2019re making the right decisions. Stepping back gives you the perspective you need to think of alternatives and solutions to the problems you face.' If you find yourself doubting your career, 'the key question to ask yourself is if you still fundamentally enjoy what you\u2019re doing and the field you\u2019re in', she says. Amy Mace 15/29 Michelle Kennedy, CEO & Founder of Peanut 'You make your own success!' says former Badoo deputy CEO Michelle Kennedy. In 2017, Kennedy co-founded mothers networking app Peanut - a global community of over 500,000 women who happen to be mothers and want to connect with like-minded individuals. Kennedy advises defining what success means to you. 'That takes some soul searching, and critical analysis about what is motivating you,' she explains. 'Once you know what success looks like to you, you can go after it.' Having started her career as a lawyer before moving into the technology field, the CEO knows all too well that it\u2019s never too late to make a change when it comes to developing your skills. 'It's all about planning,' she advises. 'If you're feeling stuck, think about what you'd like to do, the steps it will take to get there (work backwards), and then make a plan. That might mean trying to save, that might mean milestones over a certain period.' 16/29 Lavinia Davolio, founder of luxury Italian confectionery business Lavolio Davolio launched her business in 2013 with no external funding and just a team of five people. Over the years, the company has grown exponentially and now supplies the likes of Fortnum & Mason and the V&A. When you encounter problems in business, Davolio says you should never be afraid to learn. 'I created Lavolio out of the adversity of losing my job in banking,' she says. 'In the beginning, almost everything was done out of my kitchen table.' From selling her products at markets to learning how to understand business plans and food laws, the entrepreneur says she continues to learn from other business owners and mentors. 'Different challenges will require you to learn how to tackle tasks you weren\u2019t even aware that existed. For example, I discovered that learning some tricks in how to code improved my e-commerce revenues by 50 per cent,' she adds. 'It gives me the greatest satisfaction to learn something new.' Geoff Pugh 17/29 Christine Telyan, CEO and co-founder of London-based tech company UENI Telyan became inspired to launch UENI in 2014 when tasked with finding a dentist for her husband. On discovering that over 70 per cent of small businesses lacked an online presence, Teylan and her husband set up the company. Five years later, UENI has raised a total of \u00a315m in funding. 'Be ambitious,' Teylan advises women aiming to succeed. 'Whatever it is you set out to do, always set goals which stretch you. Believe in yourself, push the boundaries and always be thinking about the next phase. Ask yourself: \"Where can I be in a year's time?\" It can be really far.' If you feel like you\u2019ve reached a dead end in your career, Teylan suggests: 'Get a lot of advice and don't stay stuck for long. So many people are willing to help and mentor others because they, too, have been helped in their careers, but you need to ask them. Fresh perspectives can give you confidence to approach your current role in a different way or to make the career change you need.' Andrew Hasson 18/29 Emma O\u2019Dell, co-owner of family-run restaurant and bar Acanteen Mother-daughter duo Emma and Brenda launched Acanteen in Chelmsford in 2001 with a vision of selling ethically-produced and sustainably-sourced food. 'My mum taught me never to be afraid to fail and learn from your mistakes,' says Emma. 'One challenge we had when we first opened, was realising that we were missing out on sales because people could only pay in cash,' she explains. 'We looked into a number of new payment provider options and settled on payments technology Square.' Learning how to adapt to change is also invaluable. 'I was made redundant from a really well paid job which at the time sent me into a depression but I dug deep and changed direction completely, redundancy was a blessing in disguise for me,' adds the restaurateur. 19/29 Ella Mills, author and founder of Deliciously Ella Mills is the entrepreneur behind Deliciously Ella, the plant-based brand which started out as a food blog and has since grown into a lifestyle website, series of best-selling recipe books, chain of delis and range of healthy food products.

'Secondly, recognise your strengths and weaknesses, and bring on a team of people that excel where you\u2019re weakest. Remember than no one is great at everything, there\u2019s no shame in putting your ego to one side and acknowledging where you need help.' 20/29 Sheridan Ash, technology and investment director at PwC and Tech She Can founder Sheridan took an unconventional route into technology - a single mum who left school at 16, worked as a runway model alongside Jerry Hall, and then re-trained and did an MBA, progressing to a director in PwC\u2019s technology team. Ash is also the brains behind the Tech She Can Charter which brings together 18 large organisations, including Tesco, JP Morgan and British Science Association, to take action to increase the number of females taking up technology roles in the UK. 'Don\u2019t beat yourself up,' Ash tells budding entrepreneurs. 'Pretend to be confident, even if you\u2019re not, after a while it becomes part of who you are and you stop having to remind yourself. Take responsibility to make the changes you want to see. Be the ambassador for the world you want to live in and the workplace you want to work in.' 21/29 Michelle Dewberry, broadcaster and businesswoman Dewberry made her mark by winning series two of BBC\u2019s 'The Apprentice'. Today, she continues to work as a business transformation consultant, and uses her own experiences and knowledge to empower CEOs and businesses all over the country.

The brand is now loved by celebrities including Gwyneth Paltrow. \u2018Execute precisely,' she advises. 'There is no escaping execution. In your own business, ideas are 10 per cent of success and execution is 90 per cent at a minimum.' She adds: 'Make sure your ideas are brought to fruition with great care, with attention to detail and with your consumer\u2019s experience in the heart of everything that you do.' 23/29 Rhiannon Lambert, nutritionist and best-selling author Lambert is a leading Harley Street nutritionist specialising in weight management, eating disorders and sports nutrition.

When it comes to business, confidence is key for the designer. She says: \u2018Being in a hugely male-dominated industry, it can often be pretty intimidating, but I try to remember an Eleanor Roosevelt quote: \u2018No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.\u2019 She's also a big advocate of self-care. 'In a 24/7 world we can try to keep up and it can end up being counterproductive,' she notes. 'I personally like to tackle one problem at a time, I forget about things if I have too many mental tabs open at one time. It can be a nightmare trying to balance work, relationships, family time, friends, eating well, exercise, and that damn chair that\u2019s always covered in laundry.' As a result, Gormley says it's important to carve out time for yourself. 'Don\u2019t think of \u201cme time\u201d as a fallback option for when plans fall through, actively make time for it,' she notes. 28/29 Jazmin Sawyers, Team GB athlete Sawyers is a British track and field athlete who won Silver in the long jump at the 2014 Commonwealth Games.

'Am I being consistent? Am I being consistently *excellent*? Am I happy?' she questions herself. 'Consistency and excellence need each other in whatever you\u2019re pursuing, and I believe happiness leads to success, not the other way around!\u2019 29/29 Hilary Stephenson, MD of leading UX design agency Sigma Stephenson originally founded Sigma in 2006 - when the field of UX design was in its infancy \u2013 and has grown the agency substantially since, with the company picking up a string of awards and a global client portfolio, including Sport England, AstraZeneca and the BBC. The entrepreneur has been an outspoken advocate for increasing the number of women in tech, writing extensively on the subject over the years. 'The focus on gender equality and broader diversity inclusion initiatives is still vital,' she notes. 'This is true not only for employers looking to build better, stronger teams, but also to ensure the work they do meets the true needs of their widest possible audience. It just makes good business sense to be both inclusive and representative of what our society looks like.'\n\n\u201dThe world is pointing us towards becoming the ultimate soloist, because there\u2019s a lot you can do on your own as a woman now, you can earn money, work, enjoy yourself, and that\u2019s amazing, but it\u2019s challenging too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard being alone in the world, but the world seems to be pushing us towards that,\u201d she said.\n\nThe actor has two sons with her ex-husband and fellow actor, Lawrence Fox, and a baby daughter with her current partner, musician, Johnny Lloyd.\n\nIn 2018, she said that expanding her family was her \u201cdream\u201d and that in her dream world she\u2019d have \u201cloads\u201d.\n\nPiper identified the fight for gender equality in the film industry as crucial in securing funding for her film.\n\n\"I would never have got this film made even two years ago,\" she said.\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s a dramatic shift and it\u2019s turning around so much.
