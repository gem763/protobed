(Laurel Demkovich/The Washington Post)\n\nA 57-year-old D.C. man was drinking, speeding and driving on the wrong side of the road before crashing into a downtown Washington park in July, killing two men who were sitting on a bench, according to court papers.\n\nDetails of the cause of the deadly July 10 incident came as U.S. Park Police said they had charged Jeoffrey Richard Williams of Southeast with two counts of second-degree murder.\n\nThomas Dwight Spriggs, 42, and Jesus Antonio Llanes-Datil, 63, were killed in the crash, which occurred around 11:30 p.m. The men had been sitting on a bench in James Monroe Park, a few blocks from the Foggy Bottom Metro stop at Pennsylvania Avenue and 21st Street NW.\n\n[Two men fatally struck by SUV while sitting on park bench are identified]\n\nNeither Spriggs nor Llanes-Datil had a fixed address,according to authorities.\n\nAccording to an arrest warrant filed in D.C. Superior Court, Williams was driving from 63 to 68 miles per hour in a 25 mph zone before the crash. Surveillance video showed a GMC Yukon he was driving \u201cspeeding down the wrong side of the roadway, careening off of the roadway into the park area,\u201d the document states.\n\nThe vehicle went up onto the sidewalk and hit a concrete curb before it \u201cwent airborne for several feet,\u201d the document states. In the park it struck trees and benches, including one where the men were sitting. The SUV stopped next to a tree.\n\nData from a crash recorder in the vehicle found it was traveling at 68 mph \u201cwith no evidence of braking\u201d just one second before the crash.\n\nSpriggs and Llanes-Datil died at the scene. Williams was taken to an area hospital.\n\nDetectives interviewed Williams about an hour after the crash at the hospital and \u201ccould smell a faint odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from Williams,\u201d according to the court document.\n\nAccording to the warrant, Williams told detectives he had left his home around 7 p.m., stopped at a liquor store near Marlboro Pike and Southern Avenue SE and bought a Red Bull energy drink and a bottle of Jose Cuervo tequila. He said he then went to a friend\u2019s house and had two cocktails.\n\nWith a third cocktail in a hand, Williams told detectives, he got back into the vehicle and drove toward downtown Washington.\n\nHe said he remembered driving near 16th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW and that the \u201cnext thing he remembered was a person standing behind his vehicle asking if he was okay.\u201d He told investigators he \u201cmust have passed out.\u201d\n\nA toxicology report found his blood alcohol level was .10 and .12 \u2014 above the .08 that\u2019s considered to be driving under the influence in the District.\n\nOn Friday, a woman who answered a phone number belonging to Williams identified herself as his fiance. She said \u201cwe have no comment at this time\u201d before hanging up the phone.\n\nRead more:\n\nTeens stole scooters and in 1 hour robbed 7 women in separate incidents in D.C., authorities say\n\nWith a letter of support from Kim Kardashian-West, D.C. man convicted of murder gets a second chance\n\nBefore he died in prison, prosecutors were trying to cut down his 40-year prison sentence\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "D.C. man was arrested on charge of second-degree murder.", "authors": ["Dana Hedgpeth", "Reporter Covering Local Breaking News", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9BRFBujqzTDYjivFXhCos7i44sw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LVYG7BWWFII6TBVMB4SQZSIXLA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
