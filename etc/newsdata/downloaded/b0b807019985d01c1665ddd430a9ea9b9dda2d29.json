At 20.8%, India\u2019s child wasting ratio is the highest of any country in this year\u2019s Global Hunger Index. This is a measure of the share of under five children who have low weight for their height, reflecting acute undernutrition. India\u2019s child stunting rate, which is the share of under five children with low height for their age, reflecting chronic undernutrition, is a whopping 37.9%. Over the last four years the country has actually plummeted nine ranks in the index \u2013 to 102 out of 117 nations \u2013 after steady improvement in earlier years. This must ring some alarm bells in government. All our South Asian neighbours, including those we think of as more poverty stricken than us (Pakistan, Nepal), have pulled ahead.\n\nLet us understand why these numbers are calamitous. Scientists say 90% of the brain grows in the first thousand days of human life. Nerves grow and connect and build the scaffolding which will determine how one will think and feel and learn all through adulthood. Studies have shown that proper nutrition and stimulation in these early years can make future decades 50% more productive.\n\nSo we have to think about feeding young children not just in terms of saving their lives but beyond this, saving their brains and their future. On the upside, shortage of resources is no longer a huge problem and to some extent, it is not even about distribution of resources. If only 9.6% of all children between 6-23 months are being fed a minimum acceptable diet, obviously even well to do families are somehow failing their children.\n\nEvidently, the general population\u2019s awareness about a good diet needs improvement. And there is an urgent need for a candid reassessment of various nutrition schemes to capture where they are falling short. Supplementary food programmes may be failing to reach the family\u2019s most vulnerable members. It may need focusing on anaemic mothers, to alleviate low birth weight. Suboptimal breastfeeding practices are also a worry. Different states will need different medicine, given wide variations. Six of the ten districts with the highest rates of stunting are in Uttar Pradesh alone. Addressing malnutrition must become a top priority for both Centre and state governments. Not just for humanitarian reasons but also for developmental ones: Weak human capital prepares us badly for the economy of the future.", "description": "Children are our future and it is in dire need of proper feeding.
