Greta Thunberg could be a Russian puppet, climate skeptic AfD MEP tells EU Commission", "language": "en", "text": "An Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) MEP has written to the European Commission to request a probe into whether Greta Thunberg\u2019s eco movement could represent a \u201chybrid threat\u201d to Europe and be \u201cfinanced and steered\u201d by Russia.\n\nIn the written question to the Commission, J\u00f6rg Meuthen notes that he has been \"following with interest\" the measures being taken by Europe to \"avert hybrid threats.\" He describes hybrid threats as being designed to \u201cinfluence decision-making, to weaken societies and undermine unity.\u201d\n\nBut could we really be looking at yet another of the Kremlin\u2019s many feared discord-sowing tentacles wearing the doomsaying teen activist as a sock puppet?\n\nGiven that Meuthen\u2019s AfD party colleagues have themselves been questionably accused of being beholden to and financed by Russia, there is a strong scent of trolling from the German MEP\u2019s request. Indeed, almost any political party or figure who is not hostile to Moscow has been pegged as a Russian stooge at some point in time.\n\nAlso on rt.com Nobel Peace Prize for Greta? Bad idea, say two-thirds of Germans\n\nA climate-change skeptic, Meuthen highlights the Thunberg-led 'Fridays for Future' school protest movement, as well as Greenpeace actions and the presence of civilian rescue vessels in the Mediterranean, saying they are all \"managed professionally and have significant sources of funding.\"\n\nThese campaigns, he says, are having a strong impact on politics \"to the detriment of other goals\" and will ultimately \"contribute to a loss of global competitiveness and the impoverishment of Europe.\"\n\nRead more\n\nTherefore, Meuthen asks whether an EU investigation has been conducted \u2014 and if so, he says he would like to learn of its findings. One assumes Meuthen is already well aware that the EU has not investigated Thunberg as a \u201chybrid threat\u201d and is simply trying to point out what he sees as hypocrisy on Brussels\u2019 part.\n\nAdditionally, the MEP asks if the Commission is willing to rule out \"the possibility that these campaigns are being financed and steered by Russia\" before conducting any investigation \u2014 a possible reference to the fact that Russia is regularly pinned as the nefarious culprit behind various political figures and movements in the Western world without any evidence to back up such assertions.\n\nIndeed, Russia has often been accused of waging \u201chybrid warfare\u201d against Europe, but it has typically been fringe parties on the right and left accused of Russia ties due to their reluctance to adhere to prescribed anti-Russia narratives.\n\nLike this story?
