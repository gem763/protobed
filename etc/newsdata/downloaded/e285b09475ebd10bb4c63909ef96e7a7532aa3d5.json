Not a moment went to waste. This episode of Bachelor in Paradise really used every part of the animal. But there is something that I can no longer let pass without comment: What is Blake doing during the opening credits? What the fuck is he doing?\n\nEach week, as I write my notes, I basically transcribe the episode and scatter in a few of my own thoughts. This week, the first line is, \u201cIf I have to watch Blake do that weird li\u2019l dance one more time, I\u2019ll lose my goddamned mind.\u201d What is Blake trying to do here? Is there a dance he\u2019s approximating? And at the end \u2026 are those finger guns? Sideways finger guns? Are you kidding me right now? Blake has very strong \u201cKid in a suit at a seventh-grade dance\u201d energy, and it\u2019s unwatchable.\n\nOkay, with that old business out of the way, let\u2019s get to it.\n\nThe episode picks up right where we left off, with the arrival of Angela and her pursed lips. This bitch is serving face at every turn, and that face is Evil Queen. Everyone immediately starts staring down Clay, looking for an indication that he\u2019s still in love with Angela and is only waiting for Nicole to go to sleep so he can run off with Angela in the moonlight. Mike says that Clay must be having \u201cWorld War III\u201d in his head. Thus begins the segment of the show where everyone weighs in on Clay and Angela\u2019s relationship and their so-called \u201cunfinished business\u201d with literally no evidence. Clay has done nothing but say that Angela is a great person and their relationship is over. How does this translate into \u201cCLAY AND ANGELA STILL LOVE EACH OTHER\u201d?\n\nNicole takes a different tactic and just talks shit about Angela the entire time: \u201cShe\u2019s the desperate one; she\u2019s the crazy one, the one who wants to be in the same place as her ex. She\u2019s weak. She has no body mass.\u201d Sweet Christ, that\u2019s only three \u201cfucks\u201d away from a Selina Meyer takedown. Meanwhile, Clay starts rambling to anyone who will listen that he can\u2019t imagine why someone would want to spend time around their ex and watch them date their friends. Dear readers, Clay isn\u2019t talking about Angela, he\u2019s really talking about himself. It\u2019s called projection.\n\nAngela\u2019s only response to everyone\u2019s questions is, \u201cIt\u2019s okay for him to be here. Why is it not okay for me to be here?\u201d Okay. Well. Um \u2026 that\u2019s not really \u2026 part of it? It\u2019s not inherently weird for someone to be on Bachelor in Paradise. It\u2019s \u201cokay\u201d for a human adult to be on Bachelor in Paradise. Well, I don\u2019t mean \u201cokay,\u201d because nothing about Bachelor in Paradise is okay. I mean \u201cacceptable,\u201d but, like, \u201cacceptable\u201d in the way that we all accept that charcoal is a thing we drink now.\n\nWhat is strange, Angela, is that you probably were informed that it was very likely that your ex-boyfriend was going to be on this season from a very early stage, and you still chose to head to the beach. What\u2019s strange is that it\u2019s fine for everyone to question if Clay is there for the right reasons, but the second anyone asks you, a woman who was just in a relationship with \u201cthe greatest love of her life\u201d three months ago, if you\u2019re ready for a relationship, you just scream, \u201cWHY AREN\u2019T YOU ASKING CLAY THIS?!?!?\u201d We did, ma\u2019am. Please unpurse your lips.\n\nAngela asks Mike on a date, and apparently he\u2019s not with Sydney anymore? When did this happen? Don\u2019t you know we\u2019re starved for Mike Johnson content? Give him the airtime he deserves. Give Sydney\u2019s front splits the respect they deserve. It seems like two adults had a productive conversation that led to them ending their relationship amicably. Why would you deprive me seeing Mike and Sydney peacefully work through things? Seeing mature conversations where two people walk away with mutual respect, that\u2019s my pornography. I just type in \u201chealthy emotional boundaries\u201d on Pornhub.\n\nNicole takes Angela aside before her date to \u2026 warn her? Unclear. Angela just says she\u2019s not a drama person, which, again, if you weren\u2019t \u201ca drama person,\u201d you would not be on this show. Angela says that since Clay didn\u2019t mention he had a girlfriend when they talked at the wedding, his relationship with Nicole means he still cares about Angela. Angela or Nicole could talk to Clay about this but don\u2019t worry, Tayshia is on the case.\n\nAfter this episode, I\u2019m officially over Tayshia. Instead of starting her day by talking to either John Paul Jones or Derek about this feud, she decides to confront Clay for not introducing Nicole as his girlfriend. Tayshia asks, \u201cIf I don\u2019t do it, who will?\u201d No one. Literally no one, because we\u2019re not in seventh grade anymore. When I was in actual seventh grade, I won a debate in humanities class and my opponent accused me of cheating and her boyfriend (who was in the eighth grade and sounded not unlike Homestar Runner) confronted me at my locker after class. That was more dignified than Tayshia confronting Clay.\n\nThe next day, I guess everyone forgets about Clay and Nicole and Angela because another love polygon has emerged and it\u2019s all in JPJ\u2019s head. JPJ has decided that Tayshia is the love of his life. Has he talked to her about this? No. Has he been trying to spend time with her? No. Is this all a figment of his imagination as a result of chicken-nugget-induced mania? Yes. Haley is talking to Derek about the fight at the wedding and he lets it slip that JPJ is infatuated with Tayshia. Haley is positively stunned and is pissed that JPJ gave her a rose.\n\nHaley sits down with JPJ about this and he says that he still has feelings for Tayshia out of a sense of loyalty. I\u2019m sorry, my good dude, what did you say? His intuitive sense of loyalty. Once Haley reveals that the source of this information is Derek, JPJ shows off how many legal-sounding words he knows. Jurisdiction! Dominion! Notary! Instead of being upset that he hurt or led Haley on, he just wants to let her know that he\u2019s doing his best. Haley calls him out for accusing Derek of manipulating Tayshia when he manipulated Haley by giving her his rose and saying they had an instant connection. She says that he wasn\u2019t honest when he\u2019s accusing Derek of being dishonest. Affidavit! Perjury! Habeas Corpus! Demi and Kristian are in the background mugging for the camera. JPJ is in trouble. Haley cries to Blake when JPJ is completely unable to take responsibility for his actions, and Blake darkly agrees with her \u201cfuck men.\u201d\n\nDerek comes up to JPJ later that night to talk to him for some reason that I do not understand. Derek just wants to know why JPJ thinks it\u2019s okay for him to make up lies about him. He also calls out that JPJ has decided that Derek is the wrong guy for Tayshia. This ends with Derek screaming, \u201cTAYSHIA GETS TO DECIDE. IT\u2019S UP TO HER. STOP CALLING HER YOUR GIRL.\u201d Please let a man scream about my right to make a decision in a blond man\u2019s face. All those bullshit \u201cPornography for Women\u201d calendars where men are like wearing aprons? Not interested. But Derek screaming about Tayshia\u2019s romantic autonomy? That\u2019s the future liberals want.\n\nWhat\u2019s Tayshia\u2019s reaction to all this? \u201cThis is what I don\u2019t like. They are gentlemen.\u201d Well, Tayshia, this whole problem could be solved if you went up to John Paul Jones and told him that you aren\u2019t interested in him. Literally this entire problem comes down to the fact that John Paul Jones misinterpreted Tayshia\u2019s request that he go on dates with other women as a sign that she wanted to make their relationship stronger. Maybe, just maybe, Tayshia could have just been honest and broken up with him at that moment and some of this would have been dealt with. Listen, I\u2019m not saying that women are responsible for the actions of men, but Tayshia sits around watching Derek and JPJ fighting and asks, \u201cWhy won\u2019t someone do something?\u201d\n\nSo what fills the time between Tayshia deciding that something should be done and her actually doing something? Old Matt Donald and Luke S. arrive in Paradise and take Sydney and Kristina on a double date. Dylan and Hannah fuck on his birthday. And Blake sits quietly and does nothing.\n\nFinally, Tayshia takes JPJ aside to tell him that the whole fight rubbed her the wrong way. Oh, dear, sweet Tayshia. JPJ has fixated on you like you were the first thing he saw after he hatched out of his egg. You\u2019re gonna need a little more than that. So many of the women on these shows, and in life in general, need to understand that the urge to \u201clet a guy down easy\u201d is just socialized pressure to put a man\u2019s feelings above your own. JPJ breaks down crying because he didn\u2019t do a good job communicating about the whole Haley thing. Yikes. This dude is never going to get it. He starts crying after talking to Tayshia, while he sits alone, and in the confessional.\n\nTayshia takes Derek aside to tell him that even though they have a strong connection and relate to each other like no one else on the beach can, she just can\u2019t see herself getting there. Derek asks if she can\u2019t or won\u2019t let herself get there. I\u2019m usually not interested in men trying to talk a woman out of breaking up with him but \u2026 c\u2019mon. Even though Tayshia says it\u2019s not about anyone else, it\u2019s about Derek\u2019s relationship with JPJ. Tayshia asks if Derek is mad at her. This is a tactic utilized by beautiful people to deflect from the pain that they\u2019re causing.\n\nDerek says all he feels is self-loathing and sadness. So he decides that he\u2019s going to leave Paradise. He\u2019s tired of hearing that he\u2019s a great guy that should meet someone and wants to be a great guy that meets someone. He gathers everyone around and says good-bye. Then KRISTIAN GETS A CONFESSIONAL ABOUT DEREK\u2019S EXIT. I did not sign up for this. Kristian says that even after everything that happened with Demi, Derek is a beautiful person. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What does that have to do with anything?\n\nAs Derek walks into the sunset, he worries that he\u2019s never going to find his person \u2014 and that, my friends, is how you audition to be the next Bachelor.\n\nSee you tomorrow!", "description": "Derek walks into the sunset, worrying that he\u2019s never going to find his person \u2014 and that, friends, is how you audition to be the next Bachelor.
