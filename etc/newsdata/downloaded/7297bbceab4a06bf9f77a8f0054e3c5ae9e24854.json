The Silke London Hair Wrap is one of the first products in ages that\u2019s made a difference.\n\nThe Silke London Hair Wrap is basically a small cap you wear to bed. It\u2019s elasticised around the back, so it fits comfortably even when you have a giant bonce like I do. It\u2019s basically harnessing the power of silk in protecting your hair from frizz, breakage and knots.\n\nIf you\u2019re across silk pillowcases and a big fan, you\u2019re probably already sold. For anyone not across, here\u2019s the deal. Silk is gentle on hair and skin, it doesn\u2019t absorb moisture (for skin this means your skincare stays on your face, and doesn\u2019t leech into your pillow) but it\u2019s also slippery, so as you move in the night your hair is less likely to retain damage from dragging or getting stuck.\n\nBut the Silke London wrap goes one step further.\n\n1. I Don\u2019t Need Hair Ties Anymore\n\nUsing hair ties when sleeping isn\u2019t the best practice when you\u2019re trying to avoid damage, but as someone with a lot of hair \u2013 I fucking hate wearing it out to bed. It gets stuck everywhere and is super uncomfortable. So I\u2019ve always slept with my hair tied up and just dealt with the extra styling I need to do in the morning to fix the kinks.\n\nNo I just shove all of my hair up into the Hair Wrap. I generally just twist my hair up, lean over so it stays in place and then pop the cap on, shoving any stray bits into it afterward.\n\nMost nights the cap stays on my head \u2013 sometimes I woke up with it off, but it was rare.\n\n2. My Blow Dries Were Prolonged\n\nThere\u2019s nothing worse than spending $$ (or taking the time yourself) on a blow dry and then finding it turns into a frizzy mess after 24 hours. I used to do the stocking-tie-up thing for mine, but this works way better because while the stocking trick would leave me without kinks in my hair, the top would rub on my pillow and need fixing in the morning.\n\n3. It\u2019s Also Great For Curls\n\nI wear my hair curly most days, and the hair wrap is great for keeping curls bouncy and kink-free. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s foolproof on this front \u2013 sometimes when I\u2019ve worn my hair damp to bed and put the hair wrap on, my curls have dried a bit strangely. But when they\u2019re dry and I bundle them up in there, they retain their shape and bounce.\n\n4. It\u2019s Not So Great For Fringes\n\nOne thing I want to note \u2013 the Silke London Hair Wrap hasn\u2019t worked on my fringe. It\u2019s pretty obvious that shoving your fringe back into a cap isn\u2019t going to leave you with a perfect-sitting fringe in the morning. I tried leaving my fringe out and putting the hair wrap over the rest of my hair, but it wasn\u2019t very comfortable.\n\nNow I just spritz my fringe with some water and let it dry again (I wear it curly).\n\nIt\u2019s not cheap \u2013 it\u2019ll cost you $96. But you don\u2019t have to replace it \u2013 it\u2019s washable, good quality and obviously since you\u2019re wearing it to bed, you\u2019d have to work really hard to ruin it. Like, don\u2019t feed it to your dog and you\u2019re good.\n\nI think I\u2019d recommend it to people without a fringe, you\u2019ll get the most out of it. Also, anyone who styles their hair every day because they need to iron out kinks or add curls would find it amazing, I think \u2013 over people with natural curls.", "description": "I tried the Silke London Hair Wrap to determine if it would prevent frizz and damage on my hair, both curly and while wearing straight.", "authors": ["Melissa Mason"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-20-at-12.28.10-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
