He must be allowed to recover his joy on the pitch, as he is very important for Barcelona, especially when on his best form.\u201d\n\nRivaldo says the clash with Sevilla could be too early.\n\n\u201cOf course Messi wants to play. But it could be time to reflect with the medical staff and check if playing too much time after coming back from an injury could be risky for his recovery,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important match against Sevilla but there is a lot of the league season to play yet, so perhaps protecting the player could reap rewards later, as it would allow Messi to have some more days to recover from his midweek efforts.\u201d", "description": "Lionel Messi completed his first 90 minutes of the season for Barcelona in midweek when he helped them battle back to beat Inter Milan in the Champions League but former Barca striker Rivaldo says the Argentine must not be rushed.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437077077&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF93185", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
