One of the most popular yet controversial films of the year was Kabir Singh.\n\nShahid Kapoor and Kiara Advani's film was touted as a blockbuster but that in no way reduced the amount of criticism that the film received for its 'problematic' characters.\n\nKareena Kapoor Khan recently spoke to Filmfare and gave her two cents on the topic. Even though she has yet to watch the film, she gave her views as an artist, after she gauged the film's popularity.\n\nExpressing her views and talking about Kiara Advani's character Preeti, she explained why she \u2018personally doesn't believe in a character like that.\u2019\n\nShe said, \"I haven\u2019t seen the film. But clearly it hasn\u2019t affected anything because the movie has made over Rs 300 crores. So, it\u2019s a double-edged sword. Because there are people who are actually going to watch it and have found something that they love.\"\n\nDon't Miss 43.8 K SHARES 21.9 K SHARES 20.7 K SHARES 16.2 K SHARES 6.5 K SHARES\n\n\"Otherwise, it is not possible for it to have done so well. But I\u2019m happy that people are talking about it and if you ask me, I don\u2019t personally believe in a character like that because that\u2019s not me as a person,\" she explained.\n\nDescribing the fact that it was problematic and that people who liked the film outnumbered those who raised valid concerns around the film, she added, \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s a film and it has worked. But I\u2019m happy that people are talking about things and they want their voice to be heard. But they clearly are outnumbered by the people who have loved the film. That\u2019s the reality which is sad.\"\n\nOn the work front, she has almost completed two decades in the industry and in one of her recent interviews, she said that was born to act and that she will hopefully do it till the end of her life.", "description": "In India, films spark debates every now and then and everyone's opinions get counted in making them controversial.
