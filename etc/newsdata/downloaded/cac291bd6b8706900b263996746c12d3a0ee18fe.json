inevitable\u2019 as key Congress members decide president must be removed", "language": "en", "text": "A majority of Democrats in the House of Representatives now support impeaching Donald Trump as Washington reels from allegations that the president improperly pressured Ukraine\u2019s leader to investigate Joe Biden\u2018s son.\n\nNancy Pelosi, the speaker of the house, has contacted key allies to gauge whether the party should launch impeachment proceedings.\n\nThe senior Democrat has long resisted pressure to impeach the president but is believed to be reconsidering her position in the wake of the Ukraine scandal, according to The Washington Post.\n\nThe California representative has called her closest allies and senior legislators to help judge whether there is enough momentum to successfully impeach the president.\n\nAt least 143 of the 235 House Democrats believe the president should face impeachment proceedings, according to The New York Times.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s latest troubles began after an intelligence official filed a formal whistleblower complaint on 12 August, alleging the president\u2019s conversations with a foreign leader were a matter of \u201curgent concern\u201d.\n\nThe White House has refused to pass the complaint on to Congress, despite the fact that disclosure is required by the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act 1998.\n\nMs Pelosi has given Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, until Thursday to hand over the complaint.\n\nOn Monday night seven House Democrats announced their support for impeaching the president, in an opinion piece for The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cWe believe these actions represent an impeachable offence,\u201d said the group, made up of politicians with past careers in the US military, defence and intelligence industries.\n\n\u201cWe have devoted our lives to the service and security of our country, and throughout our careers, we have sworn oaths to defend the constitution of the United States many times over.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe allegedly sought to use the very security assistance dollars appropriated by Congress to create stability in the world, to help root out corruption and to protect our national security interests, for his own personal gain,\u201d the group wrote.\n\n\u201cThese allegations are stunning, both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent.\u201d\n\nDemocratic leadership aides told The Washington Post they believed an impeachment process was almost inevitable.\n\nIndividual representatives, such as Brad Sherman, have previously filed impeachment articles but these failed at the voting stage.\n\nIf Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic leadership choose to support the process, the president would likely face hearings.\n\nMedia reports in the US suggest the whistleblower complaint concerns a phone call between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine.\n\nThe reports suggest the president pressured Kiev to launch an investigation into Hunter Biden, the son of Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and a former vice president.\n\nMr Trump is alleged to have asked Mr Zelensky eight separate times to launch a probe.\n\nHunter Biden previously sat on the board of Burisma, a Ukranian gas company.\n\nThe Trump administration put a hold on nearly $400m (\u00a3322m) US military aid to Ukraine a week before the call, according to CNN.\n\nMr Trump has denied he offered military aid to Kiev only if the country launched a probe into Hunter Biden.\n\n\u201cImagine if the Mueller report had included evidence of a phone call between Trump and Putin in which Trump asked Putin 8 times for his help in the 2016 election,\u201d said Robert Reich, a former Clinton administration official.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking

members\u2019 votes, the president is technically impeached.\n\nThe issue then moves to the senate which conducts a trial, presided over by the Supreme Court\u2019s chief justice.\n\nIf two-thirds of senators find the president guilty, he is removed and the vice president becomes president.\n\nThis outcome remains unlikely, as the Republican Party controls the senate.\n\nNo president has ever been successfully removed from office through the impeachment process.\n\nRead more\n\nBiden tells Trump to release Ukraine call transcript\n\nTrump insists he is not taking impeachment threat
