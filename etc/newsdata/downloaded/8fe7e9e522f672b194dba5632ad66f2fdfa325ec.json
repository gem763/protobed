He told us what he\u2019s buying now ahead of the 'worst crash of our lifetime.'", "language": "en", "text": "Jim Rogers, the chairman of Rogers Holdings, shot to investing fame in the 1970s and 1980s due to the huge success of a hedge fund he cofounded with George Soros.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Business Insider, he discussed some of the market opportunities he's seizing upon today and responded to investors who have scoffed at his brazen forecast for the \"worst crash of our lifetime.\"\n\nClick here for more BI Prime stories.\n\nJim Rogers is not backing down from his forecast that we're headed for the \"worst crash of our lifetime.\"\n\nIn the two years since the legendary investor made this brazen call in an interview with Business Insider, global markets have weathered various storms and US stocks have hit successive record highs. That's a far cry from a crash that supersedes the 2008 financial crisis, which remains the worst since the 1930s Great Depression.\n\nBut Rogers, 77, has no qualms with investors who may be skeptical of his forecasts and investing recommendations.\n\n\"I've been wildly bullish on many things many times, but often it's things that people don't understand,\" he told Business Insider during a recent interview.\n\nHe added, \"That's how you get rich: you buy things that other people don't care about.\"\n\nAfter all, his contrary disposition and willingness to take big risks were responsible for his rise to investing fame.\n\nThe Quantum Fund he cofounded with billionaire investor George Soros was considered one of the most successful hedge funds in its heyday. The portfolio used a good amount of leverage to invest in risky stock-index and currency futures that could have generated huge losses. Instead of getting wiped out, the duo infamously earned a 4,200% return over 10 years through 1980 versus 47% for the S&P 500.\n\n\"It's the same thing successful investors have been doing for hundreds of years: you find things that are cheap that nobody wants, and make a lot of money,\" Rogers said. \"And likewise, you sell short things that are overvalued.\n\nHe continued: \"You might make a lot of money if you've done your homework. And in those days, we certainly did a lot of homework.\"\n\nWhere Rogers sees risks and opportunities\n\nThese days, Rogers is keeping tabs on ballooning debt around the world \u2014 a phenomenon he considers a trigger for the crash he forecasts.\n\n\"Nobody's reduced their debt since 2008,\" he said, calling out the US and China's national deficits specifically.\n\nEven student debt is on his radar. \"There's a bubble in college education in the US, but I don't know any way to short Princeton,\" he said.\n\nAdditionally, Rogers sees President Donald Trump's trade war with China as one of the ingredients that is brewing a crisis.\n\n\"He thinks he's smarter than history,\" Rogers said of Trump. \"History would indicate that he's not correct in that nobody ever won a trade war, and trade wars are not good for anybody.\"\n\nTo hear him tell it, Rogers is not keen on instructing other investors on how to manage their money ahead of the next crash \u2014 even though he strongly believes a severe one is coming.\n\n\"Everybody has to invest in what they know about,\" Rogers said when asked about the opportunities for investors, given the risks he sees ahead.\n\nHe then ventured to share what he has been buying and avoiding of late.\n\n1. Rogers doesn't own any US stocks.\n\nThe veteran investor said it's \"only been a year or two\" since he reduced his holdings of US stocks to zero.\n\nHe is nonplussed about the fact that the record-long bull market has lived on since then. That's because the market's rally was precisely why he fled it in the first place: he says it is overvalued but short of a bubble.\n\nHe's particularly wary of the technology companies that form the so-called FANG stocks. Facebook, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet are \"definitely overvalued,\" he said.\n\n2. He's bullish on Russian agriculture.\n\nIn keeping with his investing ethos, Rogers is betting on beaten-down parts of the world and assets where other US investors are not rushing into.\n\nOne such place is Russia's agriculture industry, which the US and EU slammed with sanctions after the invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea in 2014.\n\n\"I hope it's the best of all worlds: agriculture is depressed and Russia is depressed,\" Rogers said. \"The currency is depressed. If I get it right I'm going to make some money.\"\n\nHe is a director and owns shares of Phosagro, a Russian fertilizer maker that trades in Moscow and London.\n\nHe has also been buying shares of Far East Shipping Co.\n\n3. He's buying US dollars.\n\nThis trade is based on his expectation that the dollar will rally as a downturn kicks in.\n\n\"I expect people to be fleeing to what they think is a safe haven,\" Rogers said. \"My plan is: the US dollar is going to get overpriced. It could even turn into a bubble depending on how bad the turmoil is. And hopefully, I'll be smart enough to sell.\"\n\nIf he's able to take profits in good time, he said he would consider investing the proceeds in gold, silver, and the Chinese renminbi.", "description": "In an exclusive interview, the legendary investor shared the market opportunities he's seizing upon today and what he's avoiding.", "authors": ["Akin Oyedele"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5238836a6bb3f7dc06b56552?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
