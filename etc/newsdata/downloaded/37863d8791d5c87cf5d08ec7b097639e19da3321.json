Attackers are then able to masquerade as any user -- with any level of privilege -- they choose.\n\nThe cryptocurrency mining component of Skidmap will drop either as standalone software or as an encrypted .tar.gz file depending on whether the target machine is Debian or RHEL/CentOS.\n\nCNET: The pivot to privacy could come with a $100 million grant\n\nOne of the most interesting features of this malware is its handling of the kernel. Many of Skidmap's routines ask for root access, and so kernel-mode rootkits are used to provide the access required -- as well as to make sure infections and mining activity are more difficult to detect.\n\nA file installed as /usr/bin/kaudited will drop and install loadable kernel modules (LKMs), and different modules are used depending on the kernel to make sure an infected machine won't crash when tampered with.\n\nIn particular, one rootkit will fake network traffic and CPU-related statistics to make it appear that the machine is clean. This will include the creation of sham traffic involving particular ports, IP addresses, CPU loads and processes.\n\nTechRepublic: Companies still unprepared for GDPR rule changes and potential EU data breaches\n\nA CPU with a heavy load is a well-known indicator of cryptocurrency mining as the power used to work out the mathematical puzzles required to secure digital coins is generally high. In Skidmap's case, traffic information is faked to make CPU usage always appear low.\n\nIn addition, the malware is equipped with modules able to monitor cryptocurrency mining processes, hide specific files, and set up malicious cron jobs for executing other malicious files.\n\nThe use of rootkits is an interesting development in the world of Linux-based cryptocurrency mining. Another recently-discovered Trojan sample, called InnfiRAT, was found to contain functionality specifically designed for the theft of cryptocurrency-related wallet credentials on infected machines.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
