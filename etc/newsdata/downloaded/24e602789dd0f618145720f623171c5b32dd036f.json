And that\u2019s part of the plan.\n\n\u201cBut results are always are always the main thing and we can move forward quicker if we get results and performances.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m sure we will get there. It\u2019s just still planning for the next transfer window, summer transfer window and how we see the team moving forward.\u201d\n\nLetting the likes of Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez go for the benefit of the squad has certainly left them light in attack, with injuries compounding matters ahead of his players\u2019 chance to \u201cget in the history books\u201d against Liverpool.\n\nAnthony Martial may return against Liverpool (Nick Potts/PA)\n\nAnthony Martial and Aaron Wan-Bissaka could return on Sunday, but Paul Pogba is out and David De Gea is expected to join him on the sidelines. Question marks also hang over the likes of Jesse Lingard, Phil Jones, Luke Shaw, Diogo Dalot and Mason Greenwood.\n\n\u201cOf course, I would like to tell you positive news, hopefully\u2026 we\u2019ll see on Sunday who\u2019s come through the last two sessions,\u201d Solskjaer said.\n\n\u201cBecause there\u2019s players here who have just started training, just on the verge of coming back or not so I can\u2019t really say.\u201d\n\nAsked what the scan on De Gea came back with, he said: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t expect him to play.\n\n\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t as bad as feared. When I saw the game, I thought that\u2019s him out until next international break because we\u2019ve had some long-term muscle injuries but it\u2019s not as bad as feared.\u201d\n\nAs for Pogba, he has been doing warm-weather training in Dubai as he bids to return from a nagging ankle injury \u2013 although the trip has increased speculation about his future.\n\nTalk has been rife about the France international since admitting his openness to leaving in the summer, while the publication of a photo of him with Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane in Dubai has set tongues wagging.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not heard Paul say he doesn\u2019t want to be here,\u201d Solskjaer said. \u201cPaul wants to stay here and play well.\u201d\n\nSolskjaer insists Paul Pogba is happy at the club (Richard Sellers/PA)\n\nPut to him he has said he wanted a new challenge, he added: \u201cPaul is part of our plan going forward and Paul knows that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to him so many times. He\u2019s been playing through the pain barrier and he\u2019s been criticised left, right and centre but when he came back for Rochdale and Arsenal he could easily have opted to not try to play them, but he wanted to play, he wanted to try to get back.\n\n\u201cIt was too painful so he had that scan but he\u2019s on the way back, he\u2019s mending, he\u2019s recovering.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been on a few days off working but he\u2019s away from here and then there\u2019s a picture.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re at Man United, you do get pictures, speculation, I don\u2019t have any problem with that at all.\u201d", "description": "United enter the weekend two points off the relegation zone.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/11/wire-19879366-1571393962-326_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
