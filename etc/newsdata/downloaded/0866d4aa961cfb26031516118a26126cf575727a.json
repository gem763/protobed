Either it's data or something on the political front,\" he said.\n\nA strong rally in mining shares propped up European shares, but they ended the week lower for the first time in five weeks as concerns about economic growth and trade, as well as political worries, kept a lid on gains. pan-European STOXX 600 index closed up 0.47% and the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares gained 0.41%.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 6.82 points, or 0.03%, to 26,897.94.
