Not only did the boycott of surf excel trend in the country, people called it against their religion. The same country was also in the news because Hindu and Sikh girls were being forcefully converted and married. But, Forbes apparently seems to think the country is safe for a \u2018solo woman traveler\u2019.\n\nWhy Pakistan should be on every solo female traveler's bucket list https://t.co/xBg9BHARrP pic.twitter.com/Sizp2SiFaC \u2014 Forbes (@Forbes) October 12, 2019\n\nOn October 12, Forbes published a story featuring, Eva zu Beck, a travel vlogger who listed out reasons \u2018why a solo female traveler should consider as Pakistan as a must visit destination\u2019. Now, here is the thing, may be the individual experience of this woman might have been good, assuming that she did manage to explore the country in the dead of the night, one cannot ignore the atrocities that women are subjected to in the country - the same country where the Women\u2019s Day march was condemned by the authorities.\n\nThe blogger, Eva Zu Beck, has over 381,000 followers on Instagram, 421,000 followers on Facebook, and 324,000 YouTube subscribers and she's apparently endorsing that Pakistan could be world\u2019s #1 tourist destination. We wonder how that could be, given the increasing cases of forced conversions, kidnappings and other terror related threats, that are surfacing in the country.\n\nDon't Miss 107.8 K SHARES 16.7 K SHARES 11.5 K SHARES 4.4 K SHARES 4.2 K SHARES\n\nNot only is the blogger responsible for a very narrowly thought out piece, Forbes is too, for peddling the belief that Pakistan could actually be safe for women and making a blanket statement about the same. We genuinely hope it is someday, but right now does not seem to be that time.\n\nThis was people\u2019s reaction to the post.", "description": "In what world will Pakistan be safe for women? When that woman is a Muslim who lives by the guidelines of the male in her family? A safe space can be subjective, for a conservative male it will be the four walls of his house, for a woman it might be a place where she can roam around at midnight without the fear of getting assaulted or raped.", "authors": ["Shreya Chauhan"], "top_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Oct/pakistan_1571039547_800x420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
