To get in on this deal, you\u2019ll need to create a free Rakuten account, then paste HND24 in at checkout.\n\nThese AirPods are Apple\u2019s latest model and come in the standard, non-wireless charging case. If you\u2019re looking for what sets these apart from the first-generation model, it\u2019s the H1 wireless chip. It allows hands-free \u201cHey Siri\u201d voice commands and speeds up the time it takes to switch between, say, your iPhone and iPad, or whatever else you\u2019re connected to. It also lowers the audio latency while you play games and adds an additional hour of battery life during talk time, totaling three hours per charge.\n\nAccording to my colleague Dan Seifert\u2019s review of the new AirPods, the \u201cHey Siri\u201d voice functionality is easier than double-tapping on the first-gen AirPods, but it\u2019s currently slow to respond to queries or commands. That they can\u2019t be connected to two devices at the same time is troublesome, too. However, these are among the best truly wireless earbuds available now, and you can get them for less than usual until later today.", "description": "Apple\u2019s AirPods rarely see much of a discount, but $25 off is nothing to sneeze at.
