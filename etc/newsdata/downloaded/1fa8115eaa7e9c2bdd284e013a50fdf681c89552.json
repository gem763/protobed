Unwelcome in the sense that the US is in effect, importing eurozone and Japanese deflation. I simply don't think this is sustainable much longer. Patience is wearing very thin at the White House at the Fed's lack of easing vigor and the impact this is having on the dollar. I expect President Trump to take matters into his own hands and respond with real aggression imposing tariffs on EU auto exports to the US and authorizing unlimited foreign exchange intervention to drive the dollar lower.\n\nJapan has lagged the ECB recently in the easing game but seems set to catch up. In that context US yields have resumed their downward slide despite the recent stronger than expected economic data. Consequently the dollar remains annoyingly strong against the euro for the US administration - and even stronger if one looks at a broader [trade-weighted] basket.\n\nTrade-Weighted Dollar\n\nTrade Weighted Dollar Chart\n\nMonetary Madness Trademark\n\nMake no mistake, further BoJ QE is taking us to a whole new level of monetary debauchery pioneered in Japan and now known under the Monetary Madness Trademark (aka MMT). The ECB and especially the Fed are real amateurs at this game. No wonder the dollar is around 50% too strong versus the yen\n\nJapan on Different Planet\n\nBoJ Balance Sheet Expansion\n\nThe Bank of Japan's balance sheet is over 100% of GDP. By comparison, the Fed is in the gutter at about 18% of GDP.\n\nIn Search of the Effective Lower Bound\n\nYesterday, I penned In Search of the Effective Lower Bound\n\nI define ELB as the \"point at which monetary policy becomes counterproductive to the goal, whether or not the goal makes any sense.\"\n\nIn this case, neither the policy nor the goal makes any sense.\n\nAfter decades of monetary madness, all Japan has to show for it is stagnation.\n\nI proposed yesterday Japan was already at the ELB. If so, rate cuts cannot possibly help.\n\nHowever, it will be difficult to assess the blame because the monetary policy action will be in addition to the counterproductive fiscal policy action, raising taxes.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Forex Analysis by Mike (Mish) Shedlock covering: .
