I\u2019ll certainly keep trying.\u201d\n\nThe government has cut the tax agency\u2019s budget amid a fight for resources, hindering the organisation\u2019s ability to do its work effectively. SARS\u2019s R9.45bn allocation for this fiscal year is smaller than its total spending in the 2014 financial year. Kieswetter, who took over as head on May 1, inherited an institution that suffered \u201cmassive failure of governance and integrity\u201d after the appointment of former head Tom Moyane in 2014, a commission that probed problems at the body found.\n\n\u201cThe resources that have been allocated to SARS have been significantly constrained, for no other reason that there just is no money,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless we have the resources to rebuild the capability, the project of restoring SARS is at risk.\u201d\n\n\n\nWeak economic growth has translated into lower-than-expected tax revenue from both citizens and companies, with a total collection shortfall of R57.4bn in the year that ended March 31, the agency said in April.\n\nSARS, which employs about 12 500 people, has around 1 000 vacancies, 600 of which are critical, Kieswetter said. Many skilled professionals left the organisation under the previous administration, and the new commissioner wants to lure some of them back to boost the agency\u2019s capabilities.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a single silver bullet to fixing SARS,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot even tell you the full extent of what it means to fix SARS. The tragedy of SARS is microcosmic of the tragedy of South Africa.\u201d\n\nFinance Minister Tito Mboweni will present the mid-term budget on October 30. Additional support of R59bn for the cash-strapped power utility Eskom will probably push the fiscal deficit for this year much wider than the 4.5% of domestic product that was projected in February. Mboweni reiterated that the aid, combined with lower expected tax revenue, will come at a significant cost to taxpayers.\n\nMboweni \u201cunderstands there are two sides to the coin of how much money you extract from the economy via taxes,\u201d and is \u201cvery mindful\u201d of the implications, Kieswetter said. To raise revenue, the minister will first make sure the agency functions effectively and see that cabinet colleagues \u201crein in their expenditure\u201d before raising taxes, he said.\n\nThe Treasury in August said it has asked departments to prepare proposals on how to reduce expenditure in a way that has the least impact on service delivery.\n\n\u201cBefore you look at just adjusting policy, you first have to make sure that the money that\u2019s due to you, you can collect,\u201d Kieswetter said.", "description": "'There isn\u2019t a single silver bullet to fixing SARS,' the commissioner says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8680/6068e701ddbd4dd8819203be2f418894.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
