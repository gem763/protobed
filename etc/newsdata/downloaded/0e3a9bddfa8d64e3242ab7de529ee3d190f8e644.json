The announcement came after the NRA filed a lawsuit alleging the city was violating the gun group\u2019s First Amendment speech rights.\n\nPreviously:\n\nA resolution passed unanimously in San Francisco this week declares the National Rifle Association a domestic terrorist organization.\n\nThe city\u2019s board of supervisors passed the resolution on Tuesday, accusing the NRA of inciting gun violence and arming people who commit acts of terror across the U.S.\n\n\u201cAll countries have violent and hateful people, but only in America do we give them ready access to assault weapons and large-capacity magazines thanks, in large part, to the National Rifle Association\u2019s influence,\u201d the resolution reads in part. \u201cNow, therefore, be it RESOLVED, That the City and County of San Francisco intends to declare the National Rifle Association a domestic terrorist organization.\u201d\n\nThe board also cited gun violence statistics in its decision.\n\n\u201cThe United States is plagued by an epidemic of gun violence, including over 36,000 deaths, and 100,000 injuries each year,\u201d the document notes. \u201cEvery day approximately 100 Americans are killed with guns and ... there has been more than one mass shooting per day in the United States in 2019.\u201d\n\nThe NRA \u2015 which is facing collapse amid financial mismanagement and legal fees \u2015 dismissed the resolution, calling it \u201cludicrous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis ludicrous stunt by the Board of Supervisors is an effort to distract from the real problems facing San Francisco, such as rampant homelessness, drug abuse and skyrocketing petty crime,\u201d NRA spokesperson Amy Hunter told KQED.\n\nThe resolution calls on other cities and states, as well as the federal government, to join San Francisco in designating the group a domestic terrorist organization.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nOver 40 People Have Been Arrested As Potential Mass Shooters Since El Paso\n\nAt Least 7 Killed, More Than 20 Shot In West Texas Shooting Spree\n\nMass Shootings Are 'Just Getting Worse' As FBI Fights To Keep Up\n\nLove HuffPost?
