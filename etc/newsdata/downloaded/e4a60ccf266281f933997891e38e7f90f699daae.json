Graham labeled the Kurds a \u201cthreat\u201d to Turkey in the call, seemingly contradicting what he has said publicly in recent days.\n\nGraham also mentions Trump\u2019s personal interest in a \u201cTurkish bank case\u201d in the call that appears to refer to a U.S. case involving Reza Zarrab, an Iranian-Turkish gold trader and client of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that Trump had asked then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in 2017 to help persuade the Justice Department to drop the Zarrab case.\n\nThe pranksters\u2019 conversation with Graham, a Trump ally who has the president\u2019s ear on national security issues, also raises obvious questions about potential security breaches. While the pranks appear on their face to have been relatively harmless, the incident suggests it\u2019s getting easier for bad actors to elicit sensitive information from policymakers. Stolyarov provided POLITICO with a recording of their call.\n\nIn the call, Graham was primarily concerned with getting Turkey back into the F-35 program and urging the \u201cdefense minister\u201d to refrain from using Russia\u2019s S-400 anti-aircraft weapon system, which was fully delivered to Turkey last month in defiance of requests from the U.S. and NATO.\n\nBut Graham also expressed sympathy for Turkey\u2019s \u201cKurdish problem\u201d and described the Kurds as a \u201cthreat.\u201d Those private comments appear to contradict his public statements this week, in which he criticized Trump\u2019s decision to pull U.S. troops out of northern Syria because it\u2019s \u201cwrong to abandon the Kurds, who have been strong allies against\u201d the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cYour YPG Kurdish problem is a big problem,\u201d Graham told the pranksters. He was referring to the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units, a group that began fighting ISIS as part of the Syrian Democratic Forces in 2015\u2014with support from the U.S.\u2014but is considered a terrorist group by Turkey because of its push to establish an autonomous state for the Kurds on the Turkish-Syrian border.\n\n\u201cI told President Trump that Obama made a huge mistake in relying on the YPG Kurds,\u201d Graham continued. \u201cEverything I worried about has come true, and now we have to make sure Turkey is protected from this threat in Syria. I\u2019m sympathetic to the YPG problem, and so is the president, quite frankly.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Trump acknowledged as much in a press conference on Wednesday, appearing to echo Graham\u2019s private comments. \u201cIf you read today \u2014 a couple of reports saying that when President Obama started this whole thing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAs you know, it was started by President Obama; he created a natural war with Turkey and their longtime enemy, PKK. And they\u2019re still there.\u201d Turkey has been in conflict with the P.K.K., also known as the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, since the 1980s. Both Turkey and the U.S. consider it a terrorist organization.\n\nAfter Trump issued a surprise statement on Sunday night announcing the removal of U.S. forces from northern Syria, Graham warned Turkey that the country would be sanctioned if it attacked the Kurds\u2014which the Turkish military did just hours after American troops were removed from the area.\n\nBut on Wednesday, a senior adviser to Erdogan told CNN that Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had \u201creached an understanding over precisely what this operation is\u201d prior to Trump\u2019s announcement.\n\nThe pranksters managed to get Graham on the phone again a few days after the first call. In the second call, Graham says he met with Trump to discuss what the \u201cdefense minister\u201d had told him. \u201cWe want a better relationship with Turkey. That\u2019s exactly what he wants,\u201d Graham said, referring to Trump and again urging Turkey to rethink the S-400 purchase.\n\nGraham then raised an issue that\u2019s been top of mind for Erdogan for years\u2014the U.S. case involving Zarrab, who was convicted in 2018 and sentenced to 32 months in prison stemming partly from bribes he paid to Turkish bank officers.\n\n\u201cAnd this case involving the Turkish bank, he\u2019s very sensitive to that,\u201d Graham said of Trump. \u201cThe president wants to be helpful, within the limits of his power.\u201d\n\nAccording to U.S. prosecutors, Zarrab and others used the Turkish bank Halkbank to \u201claunder billions of dollars-worth of Iranian oil proceeds, ultimately creating a slush fund for Iran to use however it wished \u2014 the very harm that U.S. sanctions were put in place to avoid.\u201d A senior banker at Halkbank was found guilty of working to evade sanctions on Iran, and Halbank itself could still face fines by the Treasury Department.\n\nZarrab also had ties to the Turkish government, according to a memo written in 2016 by former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, and was \u201cengaged in a massive bribery scheme... paying cabinet-level [Turkish] governmental officials and high-level bank officers tens of millions of Euro and U.S. dollars\u201d to facilitate his transactions.\n\nErdogan, wary of corruption being revealed in open court, fiercely lobbied high-level Obama administration officials for Zarrab's release after his 2016 arrest, the Washington Post reported at the time. At one point he even asked Vice President Joe Biden to have Bharara fired. Erdogan also sent his justice minister at the time to meet with then-Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch and argue that the case was \"based on no evidence.\"\n\nIn the hoax call, Graham suggested that the president would try to help Erdogan regarding that case as best he could. \u201cI like President Erdogan,\u201d Graham told the pranksters. \u201cI think President Trump likes President Erdogan. I think he\u2019s a strong man and we need to deal with strong people.\"\n\nBishop, Graham\u2019s spokesman, said in a statement that \u201cit\u2019s no secret Senator Graham has often traveled to Turkey and continued to speak with many members of Turkish government, including President Erdogan, about the relationship between our two countries.\"\n\n\"He has been clear he wants a stronger relationship and often talked about the importance of maintaining peace in northern Syria to prevent the reemergence of ISIS,\" Bishop added.\n\n\"With Turkey\u2019s invasion into northern Syria the drive for better relations between our two countries has suffered a body blow. Turkey should immediately withdraw their military forces and America should reinstitute the safe zone concept to keep the peace in the region. Until this is done, Senator Graham will continue to push for severe, biting sanctions against Turkey.\"", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/69/8e/550bb8134017b7a8bf2f8964118f/191010-lindsey-graham-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
