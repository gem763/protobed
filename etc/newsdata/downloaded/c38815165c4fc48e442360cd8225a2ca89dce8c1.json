But when I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019ll be sure to let you know.\u201d\n\nIt was not going to be Tuesday night, Colbert said, because that afternoon, America\u2019s top diplomat to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, testified to Congress as part of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry. At particular issue was Trump\u2019s 25 July phone call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u2013 one reported to Congress by a whistleblower \u2013 in which Trump threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine if Zelenskiy didn\u2019t promise to investigate Joe Biden, a political rival for Trump in 2020. Taylor\u2019s testimony was \u201cincredibly damaging to the president\u201d, according to reports, with the opening statement said to have prompted gasps.\n\nTaylor testified that release of aid to Ukraine was contingent on a public declaration to investigate the Bidens and the 2016 election. \u201cDo you understand what this means?!\u201d Colbert said. \u201cWe finally have solid evidence of the crime that Trump and his chief of staff have already confessed to committing on camera.\u201d\n\nColbert: Trump hosting G7 'not just unbelievable, it\u2019s unconstitutional' Read more\n\nTaylor also testified that \u201ceverything\u201d was contingent on the announcement of an investigation, including security assistance. \u201cSo Trump was holding everything hostage,\u201d said Colbert, who then imitated the president on the phone: \u201cJust make the announcement, Ukraine, and I\u2019ll give you the White House trip, military aid to fight the Russians, and a beautiful new dinette set from Broyhill. And, if you act now, I\u2019ll throw in this gently used constitution \u2013 I don\u2019t really want it.\u2019\u201d\n\nTo defend himself, Trump \u201cwent to his safe space: Fox News\u201d, where he called the phone call a \u201cletter\u201d and lamented that \u201cthey don\u2019t mention the letter any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, they don\u2019t mention the letter any more, because it\u2019s not a letter, it\u2019s a phone call,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cBut if Pelosi wants to impeach you over this, I say: let her.\u201d\n\nIn a separate segment, Colbert welcomed guest John Lithgow to the show \u2013 dressed as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and cable news staple Rudy Giuliani.\n\n\u201cMr Mayor, how do you respond to critics who say you\u2019re traveling the world pushing debunked conspiracies as part of a scheme to help the president\u2019s re-election?\u201d asked Colbert to Lithgow-as-Giuliani, complete with dentures and Giuliani\u2019s characteristic bluster.\n\n\u201cThe 2016 election was not hacked by the Russians, it was hacked by Hunter Biden \u2013 who\u2019s actually a Men in Black-style alien being operated by a tiny Hillary Clinton in his neck!\u201d Lithgow said.\n\nDid he have any proof? \u201cOh, not yet, or ever!\u201d Lithgow said. \u201cI\u2019m not falling into that proof trap.\u201d\n\nAsked why he met with Rick Perry and Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, Lithgow responded as Scooby-Doo: \u201cWhen you\u2019re solving big, spooky mysteries you need a team. It was Gordon Sondland, Rick Perry, Velma and me, Rudy-Rudy-Rudy-Roo.\u201d He then helped himself to a \u201cRudy snack\u201d \u2013 a large glass of red wine.\n\nFinally, Colbert asked about former national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s comment that Giuliani was a \u201chand grenade\u201d that would blow everyone up. \u201cStephen, that\u2019s crazy. Grenades are used by highly trained soldiers,\u201d said Lithgow. \u201cI\u2019m more like a can of hairspray someone turns into a flamethrower during a prison riot.\u201d", "description": "Late-night hosts discussed the explosive testimony of Bill Taylor, the US envoy to Ukraine, as the impeachment inquiry continues", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5eebb4e6e0d8e095cedb3b85e5f31c78a974a8ba/13_0_1647_988/master/1647.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eae9e45a1edbb2d623067a7fa9657320", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
