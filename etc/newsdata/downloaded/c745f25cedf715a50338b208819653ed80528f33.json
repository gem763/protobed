These investigations were happening at a time when there was little public confidence in the response to this type of allegation against prominent people.\u201d\n\nHe admitted that he did not get \u201cthe balance right between our determination to maintain that confidence and our duty to robustly test the allegations being made\u201d.\n\nMr Rodhouse was also criticised over a separate investigation into an allegation against Lord Brittan but was not found to have committed misconduct in either probe.\n\nThe current Deputy Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Stephen House, said the force would learn lessons and improve its future response.\n\n\u201cThe Met has had this report for nearly three years now so we have, as you would rightly expect, acted on the majority of Sir Richard\u2019s recommendations,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cMistakes were made in Operation Midland and we have apologised for those. We apologise for them again today. However, we do not agree with everything Sir Richard wrote in his report or indeed all of his recent statements regarding further investigations into the actions of officers.\u201d\n\nThe report - which was previously redacted because of ongoing legal proceedings against Beech - was released after Priti Patel called for a police watchdog to launch an inspection \u201cat the earliest practicable opportunity\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that the public receive assurance that the MPS has learned from the mistakes identified and have made \u2013 and continue to make \u2013 necessary improvements,\u201d the home secretary said.\n\nA spokesperson for HM Inspectorate of Constabulary confirmed receipt of the letter and added: \u201cWe will publish the terms of reference for the related inspection in due course.\u201d\n\nThe Independent understands that the inspectorate is obliged to accept the home secretary\u2019s recommendations.\n\nMs Patel said following the publication of Sir Richard\u2019s review and a separate IOPC report, she would \u201cconsider whether any further steps are needed to address any wider issues with policing practice\u201d.", "description": "Police should not automatically believe people who report sexual abuse, a review of Scotland Yard\u2019s botched investigation into a fake \u201cWestminster paedophile ring\u201d has found.
