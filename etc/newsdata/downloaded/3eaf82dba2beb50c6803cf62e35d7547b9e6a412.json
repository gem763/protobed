While some people can tolerate lace on their skin all day, others find it irritating and prefer soft cotton.\n\nFinally, if you find that you\u2019re left with indentations on your shoulders from your lingerie, you might want to choose something with adjustable or wider straps. To narrow down your options, we tested the best bralettes on offer right now.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews. We may earn commission from some of the retailers, but we never allow this to influence selections, which are formed from real-world testing and expert advice. This revenue helps to fund journalism across The Independent.\n\nGap seamless ribbed bralette: \u00a319.95, Gap\n\nGap\u2019s power lies in wardrobe staples like this seamless bralette. While this kind of design often ends up feeling too tight, it felt gentle on the skin and didn\u2019t cause any awkward chafing. It\u2019s only available in four sizes (extra small to large) so there isn\u2019t much variety, but we found that there was plenty of leeway with each option. Like any seamless bra, you can\u2019t expect too much support, but it provides enough to get you through light activity. If we had to sleep in a bra, this would be it.\n\nBuy now\n\nTutti Rouge gia bralette: \u00a315, Tutti Rouge\n\nLingerie brand Tutti Rouge caters to sizes 30DD to 48G, making its collection supportive, comfortable and sexy for people who often struggle to find that rare triple threat in a bralette. We absolutely love the whole collection, but our tester\u2019s favourite was this strappy black bralette. The front straps are purely decorative, adding a nice touch when peeking out of a top, but don\u2019t dig into your chest and are unnoticeable throughout the day. Thinking practically, the main straps are adjustable and the longline shape does a great job of cinching in your waist. Our tester was sceptical at first whether something so pretty could also be supportive, but was pleasantly surprised to not have to make any awkward adjustments throughout the day.\n\nBuy now\n\nCalvin Klein modern cotton bralette: \u00a323, Asos\n\nThe Calvin Klein bralette has become something of a cult classic, cropping up in the Insta feeds of Kardashians and Baldwins alike. Aside from its 90s racerback design, it\u2019s soft, comfy and versatile, acting as a bra or top. It comes in four sizes and while we recommend sizing up as they tend to come up quite small, stick to your regular size if you\u2019re looking for the push up effect associated with this kind of style. Despite its sports bra-esque appearance, it\u2019s definitely not one for vigorous activity and those with a fuller bust might prefer something with more support.\n\nBuy now\n\nVictoria\u2019s Secret zebra lace longline bra: \u00a349, Victoria\u2019s Secret\n\nThis brand might be known for its extreme push up styles, but Victoria\u2019s Secret has developed an impressive line of bralettes over the past few years. This was our favourite thanks to its simple pattern and ability to support a range of chest sizes. Larger cup sizes are rarely supported by triangle designs, but our tester found that the adjustable straps went a long way in controlling the fit.\n\nBuy now\n\nLindex velvet bralette: \u00a319.99, Lindex\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for comfort, it doesn\u2019t get much softer than velvet. This was one of the prettiest bralettes we tried and is our winner for decorative value. Thinly padded and lace lined, the triangle design works best for those with a smaller cup size, as it doesn\u2019t provide the right level of restriction or support. The straps are quite thin and our tester found that they did dig into her shoulders after extensive wear.\n\nBuy now\n\nPretty Little Thing black lace cross front detail bralette: \u00a315, Pretty Little Thing\n\nWhether you want to wear it as lingerie or a top, this bralette gives a lot of shape and sits comfortably on your chest. Available in clothing sizes 4-16, it can be tricky to translate from your usual bra size, but our tester found that the 12 was perfect for a 32DDD for reference. You can choose from five colours, but we liked the classic black option the most.\n\nBuy now\n\nSloggi zero feel top: \u00a330, Figleaves\n\nThe name isn\u2019t exaggerating \u2013 we genuinely forgot that we were wearing this bralette. Minimalistic, seamless and smooth, it sits invisibly beneath almost any outfit and offers almost as much support as a regular bra. As if the wide straps and longline design aren\u2019t comfortable enough, you can also remove the padding. It might not be the most glamorous entry on the list, but is up there with the most comfortable.\n\nBuy now\n\nBluebella Nyane soft bra: \u00a328, Bluebella\n\nBluebella\u2019s lingerie is delicate, beautiful and surprisingly well priced for its quality. The collaboration with social influencer Nyane Lebajoa produced some of the best pieces yet, combining luxurious lace with comfort. The straps are thin without feeling constrictive and it\u2019s not itchy, despite the abundance of lace fringing. While it goes up to a size large, disappointingly this only covers up to cup size D.\n\nBuy now\n\nSavage X Fenty floral lace racerback bralette: \u00a324, Savage X Fenty\n\nWhen you\u2019re shopping Rihanna\u2019s lingerie brand, you expect nothing short of perfection. Thankfully she delivered, with a stretch lace bralette that\u2019s as pretty as it is comfortable. Lace can be irritating when all over the skin but our tester had no issues wearing this bralette for a whole day. The straps are adjustable, but not radically so, making it potentially a tight squeeze for those with larger shoulders. Sizes go up to XL, which is the equivalent of a 40C, making this one of the most accessible lingerie brands we tried \u2013 some additional options on the website cater up to a 44D.\n\nBuy now\n\nFree People rockie bralette: \u00a324, Free People\n\nWe were immediately drawn to this bralette\u2019s pattern, but soon fell in love with its comfort. It\u2019s soft enough to wear out or around the house and the V-neck is so deep that it fits nicely under a variety of tops. We did find that it compresses your chest rather than supports it, which can lead to chafing and isn\u2019t ideal for warm weather or larger sizes. It also only comes in two different sizes and while each option is very stretchy, there are obvious limitations for which chest sizes could wear the smallest or largest option.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Bralettes\n\nFor comfort, support and value, we loved Gap\u2019s seamless ribbed bralette. But for those who struggle to find support in anything but a thickly wired bra will love Tutti Rouge\u2019s gia bralette, which was a total game changer for our tester.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
