The Slovenian then bizarrely raced Dennis to the line.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long route to get here since July,\u201d Dennis, who pointed to his head at the finish, told a news conference held in a church. \u201cThere are a lot of people to thank. It\u2019s not just been tough for me, it\u2019s been tough for them too.\u201d\n\nCONFIDENCE BACK\n\nAsked about his odd build-up to the Championships, Dennis said; \u201cThe confidence did not come until very late in my preparation. It wasn\u2019t until Sept. 15 when I nailed a training session and that\u2019s when the confidence came up.\n\n\u201cThat was a real turning-point. It was about getting the mental side to really be back in that fold of not caring too much. When I was riding I was thinking negatively and that was effecting my training. My coach Neal Henderson has tried to help me through thinking I wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\n\u201cConfidence is a huge part of time trialling. Today I was just zoning out, counting the pedal strokes for an hour. It\u2019s just about going to a special place of pain.\u201d\n\nAdelaide-born Dennis, a former Hour record holder, said his wife had sent him a photo of his baby son on the morning of the race, helping him keep everything in perspective.\n\nCycling - Tour de France - Bahrain-Merida News Conference - Brussels, Belgium - July 5, 2019 - Bahrain-Merida rider Rohan Dennis of Australia attends a news conference.
