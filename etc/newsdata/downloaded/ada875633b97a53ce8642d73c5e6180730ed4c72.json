While there, they asked the famed manga creator how much longer One Piece was going to run.\n\nIn the clip, which you can see below, Oda\u2019s face was blurred out. In the past few years, Oda has ceased showing his face on camera \u2014 probably so he can leave his house undisturbed. Makes sense!\n\nInitially, Fischer\u2019s asked Oda somewhat irrelevant questions like whether or not he likes sushi (he says he loves it), his shoe size (26.5 cm) or if he plays any sports (Oda takes walks). One member of Fischer\u2019s said he had heard Oda has an ATM in his house, which Oda denied.\n\nThe same member asked Oda when the entirely of the One Piece story was going to come to an end. \u201cI want to end it after five years,\u201d Oda replied. Keep in mind, he wants One Piece to end then, but whether or not it will remains to be seen.\n\nLast year, Oda said that One Piece was 80 per cent finished.\n\nOne Piece debuted on July 22, 1997. It has gone on to become the best-selling manga in history.", "description": "YouTube comedy group Fischer\u2019s recently visited Eiichiro Oda\u2019s home studio.
