Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, was in attendance on one trip to Tijuana on Aug. 21. Escobar, who is not on the Oversight Committee, has been a vocal advocate of left-wing policies on illegal immigration.\n\nAccording to The Washington Examiner, staff from Escobar\u2019s office recently coached migrants in Ciudad Juarez on how to exploit federal immigration law \u2014 including telling would-be border crossers to pretend they cannot speak Spanish to exploit a loophole that would let them enter the U.S.\n\nEscobar responded by calling the article \u201cfabricated\u201d and \u201cfueled by xenophobia and misinformation.\u201d\n\nON THE BORDER, OFFICIALS SEE DIVIDENDS FROM TRUMP'S DEAL WITH MEXICO\n\nIn the letter, Jordan asked Democrats a number of questions including what the purpose of the visit was, which individuals and groups they interacted with, why Escobar\u2019s office was invited, and what \u201ccoaching\u201d on immigration laws, if any, was given to migrants.\n\nThe letter marks the latest controversy over Democrats\u2019 trips to the border. Fox News first reported last month that the Department of Homeland Security had barred staffers from the committee from visiting Customs and Border Protection facilities at the U.S.-Mexico border during a trip after staff were allegedly disruptive and refused to follow instructions.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSources told Fox News that DHS revoked access to CBP facilities for one visit, citing staff behavior that \u201cinterfered\u201d with law enforcement operations \u2014 including refusing to leave one site after their scheduled window, skipping some tours and being \"rude\" to officers.\n\nDemocrats suggested the visit was nixed due to concerns about what staff were learning from detainees about conditions on the ground. Cummings later wrote that his staff was blocked \"after previous staff inspections revealed potentially serious ongoing problems with the treatment of children and adults in DHS custody.\"", "description": "Republicans on the House Oversight Committee are calling on their Democratic colleagues to provide more details about a series of trips taken into Mexico while staff were touring border detention facilities \u2013 amid reports that at least one Democrat has been involved in \u201ccoaching\u201d migrants there on how to exploit U.S. immigration law.", "authors": ["Adam Shaw"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/29/694940094001_6079238402001_6079234377001-vs.jpg"}
