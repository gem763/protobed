REUTERS/Amir Cohen\n\nThe hearing on admissibility will be held in a Dutch district court as voting gets under way in Israel.\n\nThe case has been brought by a Dutch national of Palestinian descent using Dutch universal jurisdiction laws.\n\nIsmail Ziada is seeking compensation of 600,000 euros (659,900 dollars) for the death of six family members - his mother, three brothers, sister-in-law and 12-year-old nephew - when the family\u2019s home in the al-Bureij refugee camp in Gaza was bombed in 2014.\n\nLawyers on behalf of Gantz and his co-defendant, former Israeli air force chief Amir Eshel, filed a motion to have the case dismissed, arguing that the Dutch courts do not have jurisdiction.\n\nThe defendants also will argue that they have immunity from prosecution because the deaths occurred while they were carrying out official government functions.\n\n\u201cThe Israeli Defence Force (IDF) is the most moral army in the world and I am proud to have served in it for almost 40 years and to have commanded it,\u201d Gantz told Reuters in a written response to a query about the case.\n\nThe bombing of the Ziadi residence occurred in 2014, during the third war between Israel and Gaza\u2019s Islamist Hamas rulers. According to Gaza health officials, 2,100 Palestinians, mostly civilians, were killed in 50 days of fighting. Israel put the number of its dead at 67 soldiers and six civilians.\n\nRebuffing international censure over the non-combatant toll in Gaza, Israel said it forces exercised restraint while confronting guerrillas who operated in densely populated areas.\n\nUnder universal jurisdiction laws, war crimes committed abroad can be considered by courts in the Netherlands if the victims of such crimes are Dutch citizens who are unable to access justice elsewhere.\n\nZiada\u2019s lawyer Liesbeth Zegveld said she would argue Israeli courts were not accessible to Palestinians.\n\n\u201cThe Israeli judicial system is closed to Palestinians especially for Palestinians from the Gaza strip including my client who has also been deemed an enemy subject,\u201d she told Reuters.", "description": "A Dutch court will consider on Tuesday a request to hear a civil suit seeking damages from former Israeli armed forces chief Benny Gantz, who is standing against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a parliamentary election.", "authors": ["Stephanie Van Den Berg", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430588883&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1J9", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
