I'm hoping to prove him wrong.\n\nFor nigh on 33 years I have been getting up in the middle of the night to present a radio programme.\n\nOne of the many reasons I stopped a few weeks ago is that I'd finally had enough of going to bed very early, just as most people are settling down for the evening with their latest box set. And even then I'd spend the next day half asleep.\n\nThe former Radio 4 host, John Humphrys, has revealed that he has now bagged himself a job presenting on Classic FM\n\nSo I resolved to start living like normal people.\n\nMaybe a leisurely supper with loved ones rather than a lonely meal on a tray while reading a book, taking swift glances at the clock as I turned the pages to judge whether there was time for another chapter.\n\nIn short: I resolved to get a life.\n\nThat's what I dreamt of as I walked out of Radio 4's Today studio five weeks ago, after my colleagues had given me a magnificent send-off \u2014 no doubt secretly celebrating the departure of the grouchy old sod who'd grown ever grumpier as the years passed.\n\nNo more setting the alarm clocks (three of them) for before the birds have started singing, to prepare for a programme that starts at 6am and ends at 9am. Hallelujah!\n\nSo what will I be doing next week?\n\nI shall be setting those alarms again, getting up in the middle of the night and traipsing off to... a radio studio, to present a live programme for three hours.\n\nHe said he was in his mid 20s when he first heard the Beethoven Violin Concerto with the slow movement reducing him to tears\n\nI hear you exclaiming: 'Einstein was right. This man is mad!'\n\nBut it will not be a BBC studio. It will be the studios of Classic FM. One job is about communicating through spoken language; the other about communicating through music.\n\nYou might think 'communicating' a strange word to use in a musical context, and in one sense you'd be right.\n\nBut when humans first began to communicate with each other, it seems they did it through music rather than language.\n\nProfessor Robin Dunbar, of Oxford University, is one of our most respected anthropologists.\n\nHis research goes back to our primate ancestors. One of the ways they communicated was by grooming each other.\n\nBut when humans arrived and wanted to form much bigger social groups, they realised you couldn't do it simply by touching each other for hours on end.\n\nNor did they have the luxury of words. So they developed a language of intonation. We would call it singing.\n\nIt is estimated, says Dunbar, that even now, more than 90 per cent of communications between humans is non-verbal.\n\nWe do it through body language and, above all, by intonation.\n\nBut who needs anthropologists to make the case for communicating through music when we have babies?\n\nThe 76-year-old (pictured during the first broadcast of the Today programme) said he 'finally had enough of going to bed very early' and getting up in the middle of the night to present\n\nPsychiatrist Dr Iain McGilchrist is in no doubt that when children learn to communicate, it is the musical aspects of language that come first: the intonation, the phrasing of the sounds \u2014 all crucial in the development of music.\n\nNewborn babies, he points out, are already sensitive to the rhythms of language. You can hear it in their baby talk.\n\nTheir mothers respond to it \u2014 with sounds that make no linguistic sense but which the baby recognises.\n\nAs a boy I liked to sing. Everyone knows the Welsh can sing, right? Wrong. At the end of my first choir practice in St Saviour's Church in Cardiff, the choirmaster took me aside for a quiet word.\n\n'I think you'd better not come to any more practices, bach... you're putting the other boys off.'\n\nI was nine and scarred for life. Whenever I belted out Mae Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau, the Welsh national anthem, at a Welsh rugby international, I could feel 80,000 supporters edging away from me.\n\nWhen we went from door to door singing carols, the leader would suggest that perhaps I should scout out the next house while they did the actual singing.\n\nEventually, I took singing lessons from a teacher who assured me that I was not actually tone deaf but, on balance, I should stick to speaking. So I did \u2014 until my firstborn, Christopher, decided he wanted a career in music.\n\nHe was eight when he started learning the cello. He left it until he was 17 before announcing that he wanted to make a career of it.\n\nHe got an audition at the Royal College of Music, with me turning the pages as he played. The tutor paused when he'd finished and said: 'I'm not at all sure you should consider a career as a cellist...'\n\nChristopher looked devastated. So did I. The tutor paused again and added: '...unless doing anything else would make you desperately unhappy.'\n\nToday, 35 years later, he is a star cellist with a Greek baroque orchestra (the Armonia Atenea), enjoying rave reviews at many of the greatest musical venues in Europe. But his success has not been achieved without pain.\n\nI remember the day we were on holiday at our house in Greece. He was in the basement practising, learning to convert from playing a classical cello to playing a baroque instrument.\n\nI was upstairs when I heard the music stop abruptly, then a howl of pain followed by silence. I rushed down and Christopher was lying on his back, his face white, clearly in agony.\n\nThe baroque cello has no spike to balance the instrument on the ground: you must squeeze it between your knees, moving with the rhythm of the music. Christopher had put his back out and it took months to recover.\n\nHe suffered far more, poor chap, when he tried to teach me to play the cello. He did his best, but it's fair to say I had no natural talent and eventually gave up.\n\nBut my brief attempt boosted my love for the instrument, and to this day I can feel a tingle in my upper arms from squeezing them so fiercely as I sat in the front row when Christopher played his first solo: the sublime Elgar Cello Concerto.\n\nElgar wrote it in 1919, after the Great War. Like millions, he was devastated by the slaughter in the trenches, and that pain was conveyed so strongly it has become one of the two cello concertos performed most often since. The other was written by Dvorak.\n\nI was in my mid 20s when I first heard the Beethoven Violin Concerto and the slow movement reduced me to tears. It still does.\n\nI remember taking a very close friend to a performance at the Royal Festival Hall in London.\n\nShe had no interest in classical music and no real idea what to expect, but it had precisely the same effect on her as it had on me.\n\nThere are no tears shed in the audience at another of my favourite pieces: Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 21. It's better known now for its glorious second movement, which was used in the theme of the film Elvira Madigan.\n\nI've no doubt most reasonably sophisticated classical music buffs will pour scorn on me for my populist tastes. But so be it.\n\nThey have become popular because they are wonderful pieces of music. They make the hair stand up on the back of your neck. Which is why I expect to be playing them on Classic FM next week.\n\nOn the other side of the divide are those who reject classical music because, they say, they really don't understand it.\n\nIf you are one of them, I'd say give it a chance. It will speak to you. Don't forget: music is the ultimate form of communication.", "description": "JOHN HUMPHRYS: Einstein is supposed to have said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.", "authors": ["John Humphrys For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/20/20150176-0-image-a-19_1571946932603.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
