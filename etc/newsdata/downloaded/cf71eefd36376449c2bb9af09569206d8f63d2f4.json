Since the second-quarter report analysts have also raised their earnings estimates, and the \u201cwhisper number\u201d they\u2019re hoping for is even better.\n\nIt seems analysts really haven\u2019t soured on Square. They\u2019ve soured on the economy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Problem\n\nSquare found a niche in the payments business by giving the tiniest businesses a way to take credit cards.\n\nIt did so with card-swiping machines that plugged directly into a smartphone and came with a simple price structure of 2.75% per transaction. Then Square began layering other services on top of it, including loans, based on the merchants\u2019 transaction volumes.\n\nFor the first three years after going public, this business model made Square an attractive growth stock. SQ stock closed on Sept. 24, 2018 at $99. But now analysts see the downside to this. Square\u2019s pricing keeps it from going after bigger accounts.\n\nSo Square is doing something about it. It\u2019s changing its pricing. Starting Nov. 1, merchants will pay 2.6% along with a 10 cent \u201cswipe fee\u201d instead of the former 2.75% rate. Instead of paying 2.75%,\n\nThis may let Square go after fancy restaurants, where tickets average $100 or more. But it hurts small coffee shops and the other \u201cmicro-merchants\u201d Square was built on. The rest of the industry has also been consolidating to deal with Square.\n\nProcessors have been buying software companies and merging with one another to create scale and lower prices. Merchant processors have been buying card processors, and these have become the new shiny objects of analysts. Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) shares remain strong.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan Square Bounce Back?\n\nThe problems with SQ stock are all in the stock market. Square hasn\u2019t changed. Analysts\u2019 views of it changed.\n\nThey realized that Square is a very expensive stock. Even on Oct. 24 you\u2019re paying nearly 8 times revenue for a company that usually loses money. That\u2019s not out of line for the industry. Visa now trades at over 17 times revenue. So does Mastercard. But those companies have earnings and dividends. Square doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe fall of SQ stock has some analysts pressing the buy button. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) upgraded the stock in September. The last few times Square hit a dreaded \u201cdeath cross,\u201d the average price over a quarter falling below that for a year, it quickly bounced back.\n\nSquare shares did rise after the bullish calls, to over $64. But a month later they trade at nearly the same price they were at before the \u201cbuy\u201d signal went out. So much for technicians and \u201coversold\u201d indicators.\n\nThe Bottom Line on SQ Stock\n\nSquare is flashing a signal about the economy. It\u2019s not a good one.\n\nThe stock has become much more sensitive to economic moods and the current mood is souring.\n\nThe price hike won\u2019t be reflected in the third-quarter results. They could disappoint again.\n\nManagement seems aware of the gathering gloom. Cash on hand has been increasing this year and stood at over $1.6 billion in June. There has been a focus on operating cash flow, which has also been increasing. Over the longer run Square should keep growing and could even be bought in the wake of a recession.\n\nBut now is not the time to buy Square. Now may not be the time to buy anything.\n\nDana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.
