Biden investigated for any overlap between his official actions and his son Hunter\u2019s business ties abroad.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s view is there is no linkage between that and the trade talks. I guarantee there will be no linkage,\u201d Mr. Kudlow told White House reporters.\n\nHowever, Mr. Kudlow was unable to say whether the president was joking when he said China ought to look into the Bidens, generally.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t honestly know,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s suggestion about China and the Bidens, floated in the White House driveway last week, sparked consternation among House Democrats pursuing an impeachment inquiry into whether Mr. Trump dangled military aid to Ukraine in exchange for dirt on Mr. Biden, a key 2020 Democratic rival.\n\nA pair of Senate Republicans, Mitt Romney of Utah and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, pushed back against the president\u2019s China suggestion, though others said Mr. Trump appeared to be kidding or baiting the press.\n\nThe flareup over Mr. Biden and China is unfolding as U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Steven Mnuchin welcome a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier Liu He to restart thorny trade talks in Washington on Oct. 10.\n\n\u201cThe two sides will look to build on the deputy-level talks of the past weeks,\u201d White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said. \u201cTopics of discussion will include forced technology transfer, intellectual property rights, services, non-tariff barriers, agriculture, and enforcement.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
