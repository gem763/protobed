Check.\n\nOne, sitting next to me, didn\u2019t just know Christian McCaffrey was the best player on the field. He knew O.J. Howard wasn\u2019t having much of a year but had recently caught a foul ball one-handed. He had D.J. Moore on his fantasy team. A New England Patriots fan, he bitterly recalled the Philly Special play in Super Bowl LII, and wondered whether Antonio Brown\u2019s release would lead to Rob Gronkowski\u2019s return from retirement.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t alone in my admittedly small sample size. One gave a good overview of the Buffalo Bills. Another claimed, somewhat to my disbelief, to have previously seen the same fair-catch-free-kick attempt that Carolina unsuccessfully attempted at the end of the first half.\n\nAl Riveron explains the fair catch, free kick in #CARvsTB: pic.twitter.com/QNbuinAtNz \u2014 NFL Officiating (@NFLOfficiating) October 13, 2019\n\nThere were, of course, NFL first-timers on hand, but the near-capacity crowd of 60,087 understood what was going on. It cheered in the right places, got loud at critical times, even mockingly applauded the Buccaneers\u2019 punt returner for catching one following two consecutive muffs.\n\nAbout the only thing out of whack were the teas on offer in the stadium.\n\nWhat follows from here isn\u2019t obvious. The current four-games-per-year setup in London, in two stadiums, is a pretty good one, and may be just enough to satiate demand. The London games still have a celebration-of-football feel to them \u2014 fans wore the jerseys of pretty much every team (Aaron Rodgers in particular, to my eye).\n\nActually moving a team to London full-time would bring all sorts of logistical challenges, as well as probably depress the number of Americans flying in to watch.\n\nWhat is clear, though, is that the NFL has cultivated a base in the U.K.\n\nAnd that Brit joining your fantasy football league won\u2019t be a walkover.", "description": "The American football league has moved beyond its image as a freak show in the British capital.", "authors": ["Steve Goldstein", "European Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT233_caroli_ZG_20191014094930.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
