He is very pragmatic and a born politician who has been a Socialist activist since he was a teenager,\u201d said University of Lisbon political scientist Marina Costa Lobo.\n\nAfter earning a law and political science degree, Costa was named secretary of state for parliamentary affairs in 1995, aged just 34 \u2014 a key role in the Socialist minority government of Antonio Guterres, the current UN secretary general. Costa was promoted to justice minister four years later.\n\nFollowing a brief stint as a member of the European Parliament, he was appointed interior minister in 2005 in the government of Jose Socrates.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Odd contraption\u2019 \u2013\n\nHe quit two years later to make a successful run for mayor of Lisbon. He was re-elected to the post in 2009 and 2013.\n\nThe move to municipal politics allowed Costa to distance himself from Socrates, who stepped down as prime minister in 2011 after negotiating Portugal\u2019s international bailout. Socrates was arrested in 2014, accused of corruption and tax evasion.\n\nCosta came to power in 2015 following an election in which his Socialists had finished second behind a centre-right coalition that had overseen a harsh EU-imposed austerity programme. Under the plan, a three-year 78 billion euro ($85 billion) bailout kept finances afloat during the eurozone debt crisis.\n\nIn a surprise move, he convinced two smaller hard-left parties to support a minority Socialist government that foes nicknamed the \u201cgeringonca\u201d, or odd contraption.\n\nThe post-election deal was seen as a demonstration of the former lawyer\u2019s negotiating skills.\n\nMany analysts predicted the government would last six months at most but it completed its four-year mandate.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Slightly annoying optimism\u2019 \u2013\n\nRiding the tide of a global economic recovery and a tourism boom, Costa was able to undo some of the austerity measures imposed by his predecessors even as his government slashed the budget deficit to nearly zero \u2014 well within the limits imposed by European budget rules.\n\nCosta \u201chad the clear-sightedness to see that he could ally himself with the (hard) left without making too many compromises,\u201d said political scientist Antonio Costa Pinto.\n\nThough the prime minister is praised among supporters for his constant smile and common touch, voters got a glimpse of another side during a final campaign appearance on Friday in downtown Lisbon.\n\nWhen an elderly man challenged the prime minister over the government\u2019s handling of wildfires in central Portugal in 2017 that killed over 60 people, the usually affable Costa lost his temper. But within minutes he was smiling again as the TV cameras rolled.\n\nPortugal\u2019s conservative President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who was Costa\u2019s professor in law school in Lisbon, once called out the prime minister for his \u201cchronic and slightly annoying optimism\u201d.\n\nA fan of Lisbon-based Benfica, Portugal\u2019s most successful football team, the married father-of-two likes to relax by doing 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzles.", "description": "Lisbon (AFP) \u2013 Portugal\u2019s Prime Minister Antonio Costa, whose Socialist Party won re- election Sunday, is a shrewd tactician who balanced the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/5e74ef_costa-has-an-affable-style-is-as-shrewd-negotiator-portugal-socialist-leader-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
