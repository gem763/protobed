Both parents can take up to a year off, with additional renewable six-month periods if a nursery place is unavailable.\n\nBut only six percent of fathers take parental leave, compared to more than 80 percent of mothers who use their allowance beyond the mandatory eight weeks after birth.\n\nThe disparity, activists say, is partly due to pressure from employers and a society that prizes long work hours.\n\nAmong the small number of men in Japan who take paternity leave, more than 70 percent are away for less than a fortnight.\n\nThe Japanese government recently announced it hopes to increase the proportion of men who take paternity leave to 13 per cent by 2020.\n\nThere have been only a handful of suits brought in Japan by alleged victims of pata-hara, with judges tending to favour employers because of the difficulty in proving that perceived mistreatment was triggered by employees taking leave, lawyers say.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 A Canadian father who alleges he was bullied and fired by his Japanese employer after he tried to claim paternity leave appeared in a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/a16630_japan-is-struggling-one-world-lowest-birth-rates-canadian-father-sues-japan-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
