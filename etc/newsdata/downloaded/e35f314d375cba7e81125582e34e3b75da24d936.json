Black Mirror is officially happening guys. It\u2019s here.\u2019\n\nJameela\u2019s followers agreed, with one tweeting: \u2018Did we not already go through this with The Swan and decide it was appalling?\u2019 and another writing: \u2018Fantastic. Like we really need more of this s*** to make us all feel inadequate.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Caroline defended the show, and hinted that it wasn\u2019t what we all thought.\n\nThe Love Island host replied: \u2018Have you managed to see a copy before me ? Please forward .. am desperate to see..\u2019\n\nChannel 4 said of the show: \u2018From bum-lifts to nose jobs, sculpted abs to breast enlargements, The Surjury allows people to explore their choices more thoroughly.\u2019\n\nWhile Ross McCarthy, executive producer for show creators Gobstopper Television, added: \u2018This is a totally new way of doing peer-to- peer advice.\n\n\u2018Our pitchers will either get the surgery they\u2019ve always wanted, or a massive boost in confidence when the public rules they don\u2019t need work at all!\u2019\n\nChannel 4 defended the premise amidst the controversy, saying: \u2018Rather than wag a disapproving finger, this new series looks at who wants it, and why \u2013 and allows those who make a strong enough case to their peers, to undergo the procedure of their choice\n\n\u2018The show will neither glamorise nor condemn their choices: the aim is instead to interrogate the realities.\n\n\u2018All contributors featured in the series have actively been seeking surgery of their own accord.\u2019\n\nThe Surjury airs in 2020 on Channel 4.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
