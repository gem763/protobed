I especially want to thank Senator Ron Johnson, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx, Congressman Andy Harris, and Congressman Ralph Norman for your leadership on the Hill and for your commitment to education freedom. Thanks to each of you.\n\nParents and students, thank you for sharing your stories. You're why we're here.\n\nYou inspire all of us to keep fighting alongside you for your futures, and ours.\n\nI am blessed and encouraged to visit with students and families whose lives have been changed by the Opportunity Scholarship Program \u2014 by education freedom. And I am highly motivated by the students and families who don\u2019t yet have that freedom.\n\nEducation freedom is what motivated my friend \u2014 our friend \u2014 Virginia Walden Ford. Her son\u2019s future hung in the balance.\n\nWe are so grateful for Virginia\u2019s faith, for her courage, her perseverance, and her example. How exciting it was to see Virginia\u2019s story dramatized for the silver screen.\n\nAnd how sad it was to see folks in Tinseltown turn a blind eye to a story ready-made for Hollywood. \u201cMiss Virginia\u201d should be in bright lights on every marquee across America. But Hollywood elites let their politics get in the way of advancing the greatest civil rights struggle today. Sure, they say they\u2019re \u201cpro-public school,\u201d and then they choose to send their own children elsewhere. They have a choice.\n\nWell, Virginia\u2019s story is a poignant one. It powerfully reminds us all that parents want better for their children, and they\u2019ll do anything for their children.\n\nAnd here in our Nation's capital, parents will persist, they will persevere, and they will win!\n\nTheir children win with freedom. That\u2019s why 94 percent of D.C.'s parents who use scholarships for them are happy with their decision.\n\nThey like that their children are safe. They like that their children are learning and achieving in school. They like education freedom, and they want more of it.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here today. We\u2019re here to tell all those folks on the Hill that the Opportunity Scholarship Program works. Empowering parents and students works. Freedom works.\n\nIt\u2019s simply common sense to us. But to the bullies whose goal is to suppress education freedom, it\u2019s not. They\u2019ll claim this great program is a threat to public schools. Well, since we know it equally funds traditional and charter public education, and we know that all students do better because of it, the program is clearly not a threat. It\u2019s not a threat to anyone except maybe the bullies.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen them protect their interests at the expense of kids. Just ask the 216 aspiring students who had their scholarships \u2014 their education freedom \u2014 taken from them in 2009.\n\nBut we\u2019re not here for those bullies. We\u2019re here for these students! And all the students who are waiting and hoping for a scholarship. Those who need an Opportunity Scholarship. Those who need education freedom.\n\nThis administration trusts parents and believes in students. We\u2019ve fought for this program and now more students are receiving scholarships.\n\nDo you know that more than half of all D.C. students attend a school other than their government-assigned one? Washington is one of the most choice-rich environments in the country, and students \u2014 no matter where they go to school \u2014 are better because of it.\n\nBut there is still so much unmet demand. We can\u2019t stop fighting until every student in this city \u2014 and across the country \u2014 is free.\n\nTheir freedom and their futures are not political footballs. There is strong bipartisan support for this bill. I\u2019m so encouraged to see that.\n\nThis is not a partisan issue. This transcends left or right, red or blue. This is about each student\u2019s future, and it\u2019s ultimately about our country\u2019s future. Our future is won with freedom. And freedom belongs to all of us.
