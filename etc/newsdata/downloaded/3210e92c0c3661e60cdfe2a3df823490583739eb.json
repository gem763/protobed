Chris Stewart announced on Fox News' \"Ingraham Angle\" and on social media late Wednesday that the explosive whistleblower complaint concerning President Trump's July call with Ukraine's leader has been declassified -- and Stewart said that it doesn't contain any damning information.\n\n\"I encourage you all to read it,\" Stewart tweeted. The complaint was not immediately available to the public.\n\n\"It's been declassified and it's been released,\" Stewart told anchor Laura Ingraham. \"So it should be available for everyone to go and look at, and I encourage everyone to go and look at it.\" Stewart added that he has viewed the complaint, and was initially \"anxious\" before viewing the complaint, but now is \"much more confident than I was this morning that this is going to go nowhere. ... there are just no surprises there.\"\n\nTRUMP GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE, ALLEGES BIDEN CORRUPTION, SAYS DEMS THREATENED UKRAINE AID MULTIPLE TIMES\n\nThe fact a document has been declassified does not mean it has been made public, but it does increase the likelihood of the document being released.\n\nHe continued, \"The entirety of it is focused on this one thing, and that's the transcript of one phone call, the transcript that was released this morning.\"\n\nLawyers for the whistleblower \u2013 a member of the intelligence community \u2013 confirmed to Fox News on Wednesday that the whistleblower wanted to testify before Congress and was waiting on possible guidance from acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, the lawyers said. Maguire is set to testify himself on Thursday.\n\nFox News is told there was serious conversation among lawmakers as to how far Maguire could go in an open session at the hearing tomorrow. One source tells Fox News they may have declassified the document so it could be discussed publicly during the hearing.\n\nWHISTLEBLOWER SETS UP GOFUNDME, WANTS $100G\n\nA bipartisan select group of intelligence committee lawmakers in the House and Senate, who have been demanding details of the whistleblower's complaint, gained access to the document in a classified setting earlier Wednesday ahead of Maguire's testimony.\n\nThe news came as President Trump has continued his push for transparency in the matter. Earlier in the day, the White House released a transcript of Trump's July call with Zelensky, showing Trump sought a review of Biden family dealings in the country.\n\nBut the transcript also did not demonstrate that Trump leveraged military aid to Ukraine to obtain a \"promise\" on a Biden investigation, as a widely cited report in The Washington Post had claimed.\n\nAt a press conference in New York on Wednesday, Trump specifically called attention to a little-discussed CNN report from May, which described how Democratic Sens. Robert Menendez, Dick Durbin, and Patrick Leahy pushed Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor not to close four investigations perceived as critical to then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe -- and, by Democrats' current logic, seemingly implied that their support for U.S. aid to Ukraine was at stake.\n\n\"The Democrats have done what they're accusing me of doing,\" Trump said.\n\nThe Democratic senators wrote in a letter to Ukraine's leader at the time: \"In four short years, Ukraine has made significant progress in building [democratic] institutions despite ongoing military, economic, and political pressure from Moscow. We have supported [the] capacity-building process and are disappointed that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these [democratic] principles to avoid the ire of President Trump.\"\n\nThe senators called for the top prosecutor to \u201creverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation.\u201d\n\nThe Post's Marc Thiessen initially flagged the letter on Tuesday, calling it evidence of a \"double standard\" among Democrats.\n\n\"Senator Chris Murphy literally threatened the president of Ukraine that if he doesn't do things right, they won't have Democrat support in Congress,\" Trump added.\n\nThat was a reference to the Connecticut Democrat's comments at a bipartisan meeting in Kiev earlier this month when Murphy called U.S. aid the \u201cmost important asset\u201d of Ukraine -- then issued a warning.\n\n\"I told Zelensky that he should not insert himself or his government into American politics,\" Murphy said, according to The Hill. \"I cautioned him that complying with the demands of the President's campaign representatives to investigate a political rival of the President would gravely damage the U.S.-Ukraine relationship. There are few things that Republicans and Democrats agree on in Washington these days, and support for Ukraine is one of them.\"\n\nREAD THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE TRUMP PHONE CALL\n\nResponding to Trump's statements, Murphy said that \"in the meeting Republican Senator Ron Johnson and I had with President Zelensky three weeks ago, I made it clear to him that Ukraine should not become involved in the 2020 election and that his government should communicate with the State Department, not the president's campaign. I still believe this to be true.\"\n\nTrump's comments came shortly after he wrapped up a joint media appearance with Zelensky -- who flatly told reporters that he did not feel \"pushed\" to investigate Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cWe had a great phone call,\u201d Zelensky said earlier, as he sat across from Trump. \u201cIt was normal.\u201d\n\nIn colorful language, Trump told reporters that the evidence clearly showed Democrats were disingenuously attacking him for political gain.\n\n\"We have the greatest economy we've ever had,\" the president said. \"When you see little [House Intelligence Committee Chair] Adam Schiff go out and lie and lie and stand at the mic, smart guy by the way. ... Then he goes into a room with [House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry] Nadler, and they must laugh their asses off.\"\n\nNot all Democrats in the House have been on board with impeachment. 2020 presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, said Wednesday that the Ukraine transcript did not present a \"compelling\" reason to impeach the president.\n\nTaking the fight to the Democrats over the scores of Democrats who do support an impeachment inquiry could pay dividends for Republicans ahead of next year's elections. The National Republican Congressional Committee indicated Wednesday that its fundraising was up 608 percent after Democrats' impeachment push.\n\nAnd the Trump reelection campaign and GOP announced they had raised a combined $5 million in just 24 hours.\n\nMeanwhile, political scientist Ian Bremmer said the real scandal wasn't Biden's pressure to get rid of Shokin, but Hunter Biden's lucrative business work in Ukraine.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHunter Biden took a key position at Burisma shortly after Joe Biden visited Ukraine in 2014 and pushed officials there to greatly increase natural gas production. Hunter made tens of thousands of dollars a month but had no relevant credentials.\n\n\"Impossible to justify $50k/month for Hunter Biden serving on a Ukrainian energy board w zero expertise unless he promised to sell access,\" Bremmer wrote.\n\n\"That\u2019s a problem for the Vice President, but completely unrelated to Biden urging Ukraine President to fire his Special Prosecutor,\" Bremmer continued. \"[The prosecutor] was corrupt, refused to investigate anyone, and who Dems and GOP agreed needed to go.\"", "description": "Utah Republican Rep.
