He experienced three days of severe headaches and vomiting and went to the ER\n\nAfter one week, Perry was transferred to another hospital, where he was placed in a medically-induced coma. Pictured: Perry before the accident, left, and after, right\n\n'I ended up going to the ER...because it was excruciating pain,' Perry told WMAR of his headaches.\n\nAccording to his sister, Perry began hallucinating, experiencing severe tremors and weakness of his lower extremities.\n\n'That's the last memory I have,' he said. 'I was in Upper Chesapeake for about a week and I was transported to University of Maryland Downtown.'\n\nDoctors placed him on ventilator and in a medically-induced coma as they tried to figure out the cause behind his illness.\n\n'I tested negative for everything they could test me for,' Perry told WMAR.\n\n'Finally, what they determined is water went up my nose when I was jet skiing. [The amoeba] attacked my brain, traveled to my spinal cord and paralyzed me from the neck down.'\n\nDoctors believe he may have become infected with naegleria fowleri, a parasite that can cause a rare and devastating infection of the brain.\n\nThe single-celled organism is commonly found in warm freshwater, such as lakes, rivers, and hot springs, as well as in soil.\n\nDoctors determined an amoeba had entered Perry's brain after water went up his nose when he fell into the water. Pictured: Perry in his wheelchair at home\n\nPerry spent three months in the hospital and two months in rehabilitation. He is currently paralyzed but doctors say they expect he'll make a full recovery.

Once the amoeba enters the nose, it travels to the brain.\n\nA person cannot become infected by swallowing water contaminated with Naegleria.\n\nThe infection, known as primary amebic meningoencephalitis, is very rare, with only about 35 cases reported in the US in the last decade, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAccording to a GoFundMe page, Perry was transferred to the University of Maryland Orthopedic Institute on June 13 where he underwent intense physical and occupational therapy.\n\nAfter three months in the hospital and another two months in rehabilitation, he was discharged home.\n\n'Initially it was we're not sure if I'm ever going to be able to walk again,' Perry told WMAR.\n\n'I had a neurology appointment at the University of Maryland and my neurologist told me she can't believe the progress I've made and she thinks I will make if not a full recovery pretty close to it.'\n\nPerry's family has set up a GoFundMe page to help cover his medical expenses. As of Wednesday afternoon, more than $4,000 has been raised out of a $50,000 goal.", "description": "Ryan Perry, 30, of Bel Air, Maryland, was infected with a brain-eating amoeba after he fell off his jet ski while riding on\u00a0the Susquehanna River on May 8 and ended up temporarily paralyzed.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/20/20395002-0-image-a-19_1572467966980.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
