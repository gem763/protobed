An attorney for Correia, who was also charged as part of the alleged campaign-finance scheme, declined to comment. All three have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them.\n\n\u201cMany false things have been said about me and my family in the press and media recently,\u201d Parnas said after a court appearance in New York on Wednesday. \u201cI look forward to defending myself vigorously in court, and I\u2019m certain that in time the truth will be revealed, and I will be vindicated.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump has claimed that he does not know the duo. But he appeared in photos with both and hosted them for dinner at the White House last year, according to photos and videos Parnas posted on Facebook. The two men also told associates that they met with the president in the residence, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know those gentlemen. . . . Now, it\u2019s possible I have a picture with them, because I have a picture with everybody,\u201d the president said earlier this month.\n\nWhite House officials and Giuliani did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA highflying lifestyle\n\nPeople who encountered Parnas and Fruman over the past year said the two appeared to be burning through cash at a high rate, zipping around the country on a private jet and staying at luxury hotels.\n\nAD\n\nAt the same time, they were pouring money into American political campaigns, including a $325,000 contribution in May 2018 to a pro-Trump super PAC that gave them access to elite donor events where they made new business connections, according to campaign finance filings and people who encountered the two men.\n\nIt is not clear where the duo was getting the money to support their luxury lifestyle, raising questions about whether they had financial backers. Public filings suggest the men have had financial challenges in recent years.\n\nAD\n\nSometime in the summer or fall of 2018, the two were introduced to Giuliani by a mutual friend, the former New York mayor has said. Giuliani has said his security firm was then hired by a business co-founded by Parnas, Fraud Guarantee, to offer advice on technology and regulatory issues.\n\nAD\n\nFor his services, Giuliani has said his firm was paid $500,000 in two installments in the fall of 2018. He said he knows the source of funds used to pay his fee.\n\n\u201cI know exactly where the money came from. I knew it at the time,\u201d Giuliani told The Post earlier this month. \u201cI will prove beyond any doubt it came from the United States of America \u2026 It\u2019s not Russian money. I have seen the wires.\u201d\n\nPeople who encountered Parnas and Fruman around that time said the two spoke openly about their difficulty in finding money to pay Giuliani. \u201cCan you loan me $500K so I can get Rudy off my back?\u201d Parnas asked, said one person who spoke to him in that time period.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy early 2019, the two appeared to be growing closer to Giuliani. Parnas has said that in January he helped connect Giuliani to a former Ukrainian prosecutor who claimed he had been fired at the urging of then-Vice President Joe Biden because he was investigating a Ukrainian company whose board included Biden\u2019s son.\n\nIn fact, the prosecutor\u2019s ouster was supported by the international community, and former Ukrainian and U.S. officials have said the investigation into the company was dormant at the time.\n\nIn a phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president in July, Trump pressed for Ukraine to open an investigation into the matter.\n\nClaims of ties to billionaires\n\nParnas and Fruman claimed to have a deep book of influential foreign contacts.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to two Florida developers and a lawsuit filed by Parnas, he dangled the prospect of securing a major investment from Akhmedov, an energy mogul, for a real estate project.\n\nAD\n\nOriginally from Azerbaijan, Akhmedov served for several years in the Russian senate. In an interview last year, Turkey\u2019s foreign minister credited Akhmedov with using his personal relationship with Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin to improve ties between the two countries.\n\nIn 2017, Parnas and Correia made an unsuccessful attempt to secure a $100 million investment from Akhmedov to finance the purchase and renovation of the 100-year-old historic St. Louis Railway exchange, according to the suit.\n\n\u201cThey were trying to secure investment from him for our projects and I believe other business deals of theirs,\u201d Steven Michael, managing partner of the railway project, wrote in an email to The Post. Michael said that Parnas and Correia\u2019s involvement with the project was limited and has now ended.\n\nA spokesman for Akhmedov said he met the men during a visit to Florida, but he later declined several investment opportunities they presented to him. Akhemedov \u201chas no relationship with any of those individuals, business or personal, and was not aware they were using his name in their business dealings,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nAD\n\nThis summer, Parnas and Fruman began telling potential business partners that their luxury lifestyle was being bankrolled by a different billionaire: Firtash.\n\nThe two men claimed to associates that they and Correia were pitching a lucrative business deal involving Middle East natural gas that would involve the powerful Ukrainian, and that he was paying their expenses, according to the people familiar with the discussion.\n\nFirtash is a major player in the fertilizer industry in Ukraine and owns fertilizer plants in neighboring countries, as well.\n\nThe proposal did not get off the ground before Parnas and Fruman were arrested earlier this month, the people said.\n\nAttorneys for Firtash have denied he has had any business dealings with the two men. A Firtash spokesman did not respond to questions about the gas proposal.\n\nFirtash was charged in Chicago in 2013 with being involved with a bribery conspiracy in India related to mining interests. Prosecutors have alleged in court filings that he has ties to Russian organized crime. Firtash has denied all wrongdoing.\n\nAs he fights extradition to the United States, Firtash has made moves aligning himself with Trump and the president\u2019s allies. This summer, he replaced his longtime lawyer, a Democrat, with the husband-and-wife team of Victoria Toensing and Joseph diGenova, who appear frequently on Fox News to defend Trump and have served as informal advisers to Trump\u2019s legal team, including Giuliani.\n\nParnas, who met Firtash in Vienna this summer through a mutual Ukrainian friend, had recommended Toensing and diGenova, as The Post previously reported. The lawyers, in turn, hired Parnas to serve as a translator.\n\nTrump contacts\n\nAnother business pitch by the two men in April placed them even more squarely at the intersection of U.S. and Ukrainian politics.\n\nThat month, the two men secured a meeting with Kolomoisky in Tel Aviv, where the billionaire had been living in self-imposed exile after the Ukrainian government nationalized a bank he had controlled.\n\nKolomoisky has been seen as an ally of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. His business holdings include the television station that aired a comedy series that starred Zelensky before the comedian was unexpectedly elected as Ukraine\u2019s president in May. Zelensky also tapped Kolomoisky\u2019s former lawyer to be his chief of staff.\n\nMarks, a Pennsylvania-based attorney who represents Kolomoisky in several U.S.-based matters, said Parnas and Fruman bragged to Kolomoisky of their ties to top Republicans, taking out their phones to show the Ukrainian photos of themselves with Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Giuliani.\n\nThen, Marks said, they told Kolomoisky that they could arrange for top U.S. officials, including Pence and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, to attend Zelensky\u2019s inauguration should he win the presidency. In exchange, Marks claims, Parnas and Fruman asked that Kolomoisky pay them $250,000. Marks\u2019s allegations were first reported by CNN.\n\nMarks said Kolomoisky immediately threw the two men out of his office. \u201cIt made no sense why private people would pay these two guys to bring U.S. government officials over. Presumably, governments would deal with that,\u201d Marks said.\n\nPerry ultimately attended Zelensky\u2019s inauguration, but Pence was instructed by Trump to stay away, The Post has reported.\n\nPence officials have said he had never committed to the event.\n\n\u201cIf this account is true, the vice president was unaware of the meeting or the men\u2019s request for money,\u201d said Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for Pence.\n\nA spokesman for Perry did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAfter the meeting, Parnas and Fruman accused Kolomoisky of threatening them during the session and filed a lawsuit against the billionaire in Ukraine. Giuliani has said that he provided legal advice to the two men in the dispute.\n\nHe also defended the two publicly, tweeting about the Ukrainian businessman three times in May and suggesting that \u201cKolomoisky\u2019s representatives and enemies of Pres. Trump\u201d were advising Zelensky.\n\nMarks said Giuliani was wrong to suggest that Kolomoisky opposes Trump. In fact, Marks said he keeps a photo of himself and Kolomoisky in Geneva from shortly after the presidential election, with both of them sporting \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats. And Marks said he himself represented the Trump campaign in court on several matters during the 2016 campaign.\n\n\u201cIt was surprising that Giuliani would have involved himself, saying the things he said without having done any real due diligence on his clients,\u201d Marks said.", "description": "Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman pitched a natural gas deal they said would involve Ukrainian energy mogul Dmytro Firtash, according to people familiar with the discussions.", "authors": ["Rosalind S.
