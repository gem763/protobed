The Nationals also benefited from a pair of defensive misplays by a Cardinals defense that was one of the best in the majors during the regular season.\n\nSecond baseman Kolten Wong dropped a throw on a potential force play and a trio of Cardinals \u2013 Wong, right fielder Jose Martinez and first baseman Paul Goldschmidt \u2013 allowed a shallow popup off the bat of Victor Robles to drop in between them, scoring another run.\n\nYan Gomes added a two-RBI single and Trea Turner drove in another pair with a single in his second at-bat of the inning, before the frame mercifully came to an end.\n\nThe Nationals have scored first in every game of the series and have never trailed. The only team to ever sweep a postseason series and never lose the lead at any point: the Baltimore Orioles in the 1966 World Series.", "description": "Washington jumped all over St. Louis with seven runs in the first inning of NLCS Game 4.", "authors": ["Steve Gardner", "Published P.M.
