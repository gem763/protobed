One senior Republican Senate staffer, who requested anonymity to describe the situation candidly, told me, \u201cIf it was just a matter of magically snapping their fingers \u2026 pretty much every Republican senator would switch out Pence for Trump. That\u2019s been true since day one.\u201d\n\nThis week isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen signs of a potential rift. Last year, The New York Times reported that Trump was privately asking allies whether they thought Pence was loyal. More recently, rumors have circulated that the president might replace Pence on the 2020 ticket with former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley. And in a news conference last week, Trump voluntarily dragged his vice president into the Ukraine mess by suggesting that journalists look into the calls Pence had made to President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nRead: God\u2019s plan for Mike Pence\n\nBut the roots of Trump\u2019s distrust can be traced back to the final weeks of the 2016 election, when the Access Hollywood tape became public. In the uproar that followed, Pence did not jump to his running mate\u2019s defense. Instead, he retreated from the campaign and issued a disapproving statement: \u201cI do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them.\u201d Anonymous quotes began popping up in the press describing Pence as \u201cbeside himself\u201d over Trump\u2019s remarks. And as I would later report in a profile of the vice president, Pence made it clear to the Republican National Committee that he was ready to take Trump\u2019s place at the top of the ticket. (A spokesperson for Pence has denied this.) I wrote:\n\nRepublican donors and party leaders began buzzing about making Pence the nominee and drafting Condoleezza Rice as his running mate. Amid the chaos, Trump convened a meeting of his top advisers in his Manhattan penthouse. He went around the room and asked each person for his damage assessment. [Reince] Priebus bluntly told Trump he could either drop out immediately or lose in a historic landslide. According to someone who was present, Priebus added that Pence and Rice were \u201cready to step in.\u201d\n\nThis episode has not been forgotten by certain Trump loyalists, who believe Pence has shown he will prioritize his own political interests over the president\u2019s if necessary. As one former Trump adviser told me in 2017, \u201cI don\u2019t think he goes down with the ship.\u201d\n\nOf course, the ship is still a long way from sinking. Even if the House impeaches Trump, it remains unlikely that the Senate will vote to remove him from office. But many of the traits that make Pence valuable to Trump now could make him a threat if the dynamics change.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, where Trump\u2019s fate may be decided, Pence is far more popular than the president. Doug Heye, a Republican strategist who worked for more than a decade in Congress, told me the lawmakers he\u2019s talked to are exhausted by the president\u2019s behavior. \u201cEverywhere they go, there\u2019s a mic in their face and a reporter saying, \u2018Defend what Trump just did,\u2019\u201d Heye said. If Pence ascended to the Oval Office, \u201cit would make the lives of every Republican member easier.\u201d", "description": "The fragility of Mike Pence\u2019s partnership with Donald Trump could soon be on high display.", "authors": ["Mckay Coppins"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/GettyImages_1159892040toned/facebook.jpg?1570195732", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
