JPMorgan economists argue that after this week\u2019s rate cut, no additional cuts are expected this year; however, Capital Economics believes one more cut in December looms. The Fed\u2019s message will be critical for markets.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell presents the monetary policy report to the Senate Banking Committee, July 11, 2019, on Capitol Hill in Washington.

Not enough has changed in the outlook to convince them of the need for additional cuts. It is possible we also have a dovish dissent from St Louis Fed's Bullard who would favor a 50bp cut. We suspect he will be OK with a 25bp cut and dovish language in the statement, but it remains an outstanding risk. In any event, the dissents will highlight that a division remains in the Committee. It\u2019s up to Fed Chair Powell to deliver the dovish tone that the market expects.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Fed Chair Powell\u2019s messaging and tone will be closely monitored at the press conference following the FOMC\u2019s decision. \u201cThe press conference itself is difficult to forecast,\u201d UBS wrote in a note Friday. \u201cOur expectation is that Powell will want to sound slightly dovish to maintain a bias toward easing. Doing so will preserve market pricing, which Powell has stressed has caused the easing in financial conditions this year.\u201d\n\nYahoo Finance All Markets Summit More\n\n\u2014\n\nHeidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
