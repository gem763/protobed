While a majority of the roughly 100-person caucus already publicly supports impeachment, it would serve to solidify the progressive wing\u2019s support for aggressive action against Trump at a critical point for the Democratic caucus.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDemocratic Reps. Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Mark Pocan of Wisconsin made the motion to formally support the impeachment investigation in a closed-door meeting on Tuesday, just days ahead of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s vote to formally define the panel's powers in its impeachment probe.\n\nStill, the caucus\u2019 formal position is not binding. While it might put the spotlight on several high-profile holdouts on impeachment \u2014 including House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries and Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Karen Bass \u2014 it may not spur more members to declare their support publicly.\n\nNew Window INTERACTIVE: See which House lawmakers support impeachment.\n\nAnd it does not guarantee that every member would vote that way on the floor. The CPC\u2019s sprawling membership comprises lawmakers whose positions sometimes clash with the overall philosophy of the caucus, which does not always vote as a bloc on issues.\n\nThe caucus\u2019 full membership has until Tuesday afternoon to decide whether they support taking a position. But people familiar with the process said Tuesday they expected the position to be adopted.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible to ignore the mounting evidence that President Trump has repeatedly broken the law, committed impeachable offenses, and continues to obstruct justice,\u201d according to the proposed statement, which was obtained by POLITICO. \u201cThe Congressional Progressive Caucus strongly endorses the House Judiciary Committee's current formal impeachment investigation and the adoption of the Resolution of Investigative Procedures.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur duty is to uphold the Constitution and we must do all we can to protect our democracy,\u201d the statement continues.\n\nRoughly two dozen members of the CPC have not come out in favor of the impeachment probe, including closely watched members like House Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), House Oversight Chairman Elijiah Cummings (D-Md.) and Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.).\n\nKyle Cheney and Heather Caygle contributed to this report.", "description": "The progressive caucus would become the first faction in the House to take an official position.", "authors": ["Sarah Ferris"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/1f/52/db58be0e411186d6def01e67c749/20190910-prog-committee-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
