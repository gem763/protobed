The first is that the Church must listen to its local congregations, or laity; the second is that Church teaching, or doctrine, \u201cdevelops\u201d over time.", "description": "On Sunday Britain will gain its first saint in over forty years.", "authors": ["Tim Stanley", "Daniel Hannan", "Jacob Rees-Mogg"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000001873062-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqflqy7C_9_-Jt9M13Z1ZP8LvnGB2bjNV_984fjO-RWlE.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
