He'd be like, 'OK, so I'd like you to wear one of these to the premiere'.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\nJennifer said this was one of the rare instances she had been bullied in her life.\n\nShe continued: \"And I went through the book, and at the time, it wasn't what it is today. It was not for me.\n\n\"He was like, 'You have to wear the dress.' That was my only bullying. And I was like, 'No, I will not wear the dress.\"'\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\nJennifer said Weinstein \"knew better\" than to force her to wear the dress.\n\n\"Well, what was he going to do? Come over here and make me wear it?\", she added.\n\nWeinstein, who was one of the most powerful men in Hollywood for more than two decades, has been accused by dozens of women of sexual assault.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nJennifer is now starring alongside Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell in Apple TV+ drama The Morning Show, which deals with the fallout from a high-profile entertainment figure being brought down by allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nThe show was conceived before Weinstein's downfall in October 2017 but its plot was altered after the #MeToo movement sent shockwaves through the industry.\n\nWeinstein denies all allegations of non-consensual sex and is awaiting trial in New York for rape charges.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
