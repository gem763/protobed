She was the love of our lives and every single night before she went to bed, she told us that she loved us too.\n\n'She was the love of our lives and every single night before she went to bed, she told us that she loved us too.'\n\nDescribing the 'cold fear' of Ana's disappearance, Mrs Kriegel said she was living with 'haunting nightmares' after the trauma of the schoolgirl's death.\n\n'No one could suspect the evil that lay in waiting for her. No one could anticipate the darkness that swirled in the souls of those that murdered and violated her,' she said.\n\n'She wanted to live but she was not permitted to do that. Our lives are destroyed by what happened to Ana.\n\n'We cannot look at a group of teenage boys in the same way ever again. That cold fear hits and brings all the horror back.\n\n'Imagine the terror. Imagine the pain she suffered. That will live with us all our lives.\n\n'We lie awake at night thinking about the fear she felt when she realised she was going to be killed.'\n\n'Wild and wonderful': Mrs Kriegel paid an emotional tribute to her daughter Ana (pictured) ahead of the sentencing of her two 15-year-old killers\n\nMrs Kriegel continued: 'We pace the house at night agonising about the torture she went through, the horrendous pain she suffered, the sadistic violation of her beautiful, pure and innocent body. '\n\n'She was just a little girl with so many hopes and dreams and so much love inside her that she shared generously with all who knew her.\n\n'What words can describe how we feel at the loss of our wonderful girl.\n\n'The pain of living without her is unbearable. There is such emptiness in our lives without her.\n\n'Life without Ana is no longer a life, nor is it even an existence, it is a misery that we must endure for the rest of our lives.\n\n'We have lost our precious daughter. Her brother has lost his sister and every family occasion is entrenched with pain and sorrow.'\n\nThe 15-year-old boys, who cannot be named for legal reasons, remain in custody ahead of their sentencing next Tuesday.\n\nAna's naked body was found in an abandoned farmhouse in Lucan, Co Dublin, last May after the 14-year-old had been reported missing by her parents.\n\nBoth boys were found guilty of murder and Boy A was also convicted of aggravated sexual assault.\n\nThe six-week trial heard how police officers found a book with a 'satanic pledge' at Boy A's home.\n\nReferences included those to a 'satanist cult', detailing a number of 'rules', which included no 'talking about Jesus or God, only Satan'.\n\nYesterday Boy A watched on as his grandfather said the teenager was 'incredibly sorry' over Ana's death.\n\nMrs Kriegel (pictured with her husband Patric outside the court in Dublin yesterday) said she lay awake at night haunted by the 'terror' that her daughter had faced\n\nOffering his 'sincere sympathy' to Mrs Kriegel after listening to her emotional statement, the grandfather said he was 'personally heartbroken' over the death.\n\n'[Boy A] is a loving, kind, caring child who was never in trouble or shown any aggression in my experience of him. He is loved by parents, sister and grandparents,' he said.\n\nHe said his grandson was very happy at secondary school and loved practical subjects.\n\nThe grandfather also cannot be named to avoid identifying the boy.\n\nThe court earlier heard how Boy A has accepted he caused Ana's death but continues to deny that he sexually assaulted her.\n\nIn accounts of the death, he described a number actions including headlock, choke hold, kicking, hitting her with a stick and with a block, the court heard.\n\nThe court heard that there is a dispute as to whose idea it was to meet Ana, who decided to meet at the disused farmhouse and how Ana's clothing was removed.\n\nThere was also a dispute over who assaulted Ana and with what, who smashed her phone when it started to ring and who put tape on her neck.\n\nBoy B has maintained that he did not have any part in Ana's death and says he ran away when he saw Boy A attacking her.\n\nGarda Detective Inspector Mark O'Neill said that no explanation has been offered as to why the 14-year-old was killed.\n\nThe two boys will be sentenced next Tuesday.", "description": "Ana Kriegel (pictured), 14, was found dead in an abandoned farmhouse near Dublin in May 2018 and two 15-year-old boys were found guilty of her murder earlier this year.", "authors": ["Tim Stickings For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/09/20367374-0-image-a-18_1572428513953.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
