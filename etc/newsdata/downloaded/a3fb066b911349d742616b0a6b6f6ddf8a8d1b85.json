So, a priest has decided to invite the strays into his church and has made them a part of his service.\n\nFather Jo\u00e3o Paulo Araujo Gomes who is the head of the parish of Santana brings them to mass in hopes to convince families to adopt them.\n\nForgotten doggos often wander into the church, hoping to meet their new owner.\n\nAnd Father Jo\u00e3o does his best to make it happen.\n\nThe kind priest houses them at his rectory, ready to take them to Sunday service and show them off.\n\nThe dogs take centre stage at the service so potential new owners can watch them and fall in love.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPooches, who sometimes fall asleep at the altar, are also down for some petting and belly rubs. If only all Sunday services included the lovable canines.\n\nDoggos are just attracted to Father Jo\u00e3o (Picture: Padre Joao Paulo Araujo Gomes)\n\nFather Jo\u00e3o explained it started when someone had offered him cookies one day.\n\nWhen he left them out in mass, they were quickly taken up by attendees. And that gave him an idea when he came across a dog kennel with 96 dogs.\n\nHe told Metro.co.uk: \u2018Then I began to bring the dogs to mass, with the same hopes of giving them away.\n\nHe can\u2019t help but pet them during service (Picture: Padre Joao Paulo Araujo Gomes)\n\n\u2018In six months, I finished this process. All dogs were adopted.\n\n\u2018Now I work with street dogs. They sometimes come into the church looking for food and water.\n\n\u2018During service, we speak about dogs of the street, about how to respect and protect them. The church also helps with a castration project (to limit the number of stray dogs).\n\n\u2018We also help dogs in emergencies such as victims of violence or health problems.\u2019\n\nThey sometimes fall asleep during mass (Picture: Padre Joao Paulo Araujo Gomes)\n\nThe priest even adopted three of the dogs himself (Picture: Padre Joao Paulo Araujo Gomes)\n\nThanks to the selfless priest, the number of strays has decreased substantially.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd hanging out with doggos so much, Father Jo\u00e3o couldn\u2019t help but adopt some himself. He now has three canine friends who even share a bed with him.\n\nMORE: Two sausage dogs make their relationship official with lavish wedding\n\nMORE: Why you should \u2018date\u2019 rescue dogs before you decide to take them home\n\nMORE: Can cats, dogs and other pets eat pumpkin seeds?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Father Jo\u00e3o Paulo Araujo Gomes, head of the parish of Santana in the city of Gravat\u00e1 in Brazil, has helped many street dogs get adopted.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_91790608_1572171310.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
