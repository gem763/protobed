(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nThe future is looking bright... or is it dark? io9 co-founder Charlie Jane Anders\u2019 novel The City in the Middle of the Night is being adapted for television!\n\nDeadline is reporting that Sony Pictures Television has optioned a series for the dynamic sci-fi novel with The Expanse executive producer Sharon Hall coming on board. According to Deadline, Hall brought The City in the Middle of the Night to Sony as part of a first-look deal.\n\nThe book, which followed Anders\u2019 Nebula-winning debut All the Birds in the Sky, takes place in the distant future on a harsh, inhospitable planet that\u2019s split between freezing, black nights and scorching-hot days. A young woman named Sophie, excommunicated from one of the planet\u2019s tyrannical cities and left to die in the wilderness, rises up to become a hero for the people she loves and the planet\u2019s original inhabitants.\n\nAnders herself had this to say when contacted by Gizmodo:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m overjoyed to be working with Sony and with Sharon Hall\u2019s Mum de Guerre Productions, especially after being utterly blown away by Sharon\u2019s work on The Expanse. There\u2019s so much fun stuff that a TV series can explore about this world of extremes, and the damaged, resourceful, open-hearted people who try to survive there. I\u2019ve been so overjoyed by all the conversations we\u2019ve had about bringing my exoplanet fairy tale to life, and I\u2019m stoked to be working with some of the smartest people in the business.\u201d\n\nCharlie Jane Anders And Annalee Newitz On Creating Worlds, And How To Tell If You're In An Alternate Timeline Readers of Gizmodo are no doubt very aware that since leaving the site, io9 co-founders Charlie Jane Anders and Annalee Newitz have gone on to write their own award-winning works of fiction. But how do science fiction and fantasy bloggers move to writing science fiction themselves? At a recent talk in London, England, the duo discussed their process. Read more\n\nAnnalee Newitz And Charlie Jane Anders On The Intersection Between Writing About Science And Writing Science Fiction io9 was founded as a website dedicated to both science journalism and science-fiction and cultural criticism. And although that mission has evolved over the years, that intersection between science and science fiction is something that still drives co-founders Charlie Jane Anders and Annalee Newitz\u2019 work as authors. At a recent talk in London, England, the duo discussed how their science backgrounds have influenced their fiction. Read more\n\nOur own James Whitbrook actually had a chance to sit in on Anders\u2019 and io9 co-founder Annalee Newitz\u2019s recent talk in London, where they discussed the challenges and rewards of telling stories that speculate on the future of science, technology and how people relate to one another (parts one and two are above, but just in case you can also find them here and here).\n\nOne of Anders\u2019 fascinations was with time, sharing how setting The City in the Middle of the Night in the far-distant future gave her an opportunity to explore a reality we most likely could never truly understand.\n\nThe City in the Middle of the Night takes place in the 34th century. There\u2019s a date revealed later in the book where you find out it\u2019s the year 3309, or something. And [it got me] thinking about how different people were 1,200 years ago, versus how we live now. Like, in the 900s versus the present. There\u2019s a lot of stuff you\u2019d have a hard time explaining to someone from the year 819. Someone from 819 would have a really hard time understanding a lot of stuff about the world we\u2019re living in. There\u2019s certain things they\u2019d be like: \u201cOf course \u2014 we do that, just slightly differently.\u201d So, when you\u2019re projecting into the future, I think you kind of have to do that in reverse and think about how shockingly different the world 1,200 years from now might be.\n\nNo word on when we can expect The City in the Middle of the Night to hit screens, but we\u2019ll definitely see more from Anders on television before then: She recently announced she\u2019s joined the writing team for Y: The Last Man, which is currently in production for FX.", "description": "The future is looking bright... or is it dark? io9 co-founder Charlie Jane Anders\u2019 novel The City in the Middle of the Night\u00a0is being adapted for television!...", "authors": ["Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/qq8rkujahd7o9gclreys.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
