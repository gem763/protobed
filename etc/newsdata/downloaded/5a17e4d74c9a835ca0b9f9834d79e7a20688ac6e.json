Americans are sick of always getting handed the bill for some lame ruling caste priority, whether it\u2019s paying for the privilege of defending Europe on behalf of ungrateful continentals or funding the weird climate religion or letting China get rich off of gutting our industries. Mostly, we are sick of shipping our magnificent warriors off to die in ill-conceived, poorly-planned, ineptly-executed wars where we ended up shedding our boys\u2019 (and girls\u2019) blood refereeing fights that go back a dozen centuries.\n\nThe coastal elite gets to bask in the radiance of its own moral superiority for deploying young people in camo from Nebraska farms and Texas towns, and we get to hold the funerals.\n\nHard pass.\n\nWe\u2019re done being suckers. We\u2019re done being at the back of a line that consists of the entire world when it comes to who our master caste protects. And we\u2019re done with the elite cashing-in \u2013 have you noticed that all the outrage out there among the hoi polloi is directed not at the manifest corruption itself but at Donald Trump for calling out the manifest corruption of noted-Boliviaphile Hoover McPaternity Biden?\n\nAmerica First is a commonsense response to decades of America Last. It\u2019s a repudiation of those who get elected by Americans to protect and promote American interests yet think of themselves as \u201cGlobal Citizens.\u201d\n\nThe elite scoffs at the notion of a \u201cTrump Doctrine,\u201d imagining that no one but them could construct a coherent geopolitical paradigm. Of course, their neo-Wilsonian faculty lounge geopolitical paradigm has been a disaster, but if there\u2019s one thing our garbage elite is good at \u2013 it is certainly no good at its core responsibilities of preserving American power, prosperity and freedom \u2013 it is weaseling out of accountability for its myriad failures.\n\nYet the Trump Doctrine \u2013 the notion that American power should be directed toward serving the interests of the American people \u2013 is a coherent foreign policy vision of the kind we have not had in the United States for decades. For the last 35 years, since the Reagan Doctrine of using American power to bring down the Soviet Union, we have had no coherent framework within which we could develop sensible national strategies.\n\nThe Cold War ended and we sort of implemented a mishmash of strategies, but without a clear objective to aim them at like the Reagan and Trump Doctrines offer. One strategy was to try to turn nations toward global mega-corporate capitalism, but the purpose of that was what? How was it helpful to America when we subsidized international development through bad trade deals that wrecked our manufacturing base and traumatized our working class? Sure, it was helpful to the pocketbooks of the globalist elite\u2019s US Franchise, but if you want to see the true cost walk through the opioid-scarred, despairing ruins of the Midwest that are only now, under Trump, stirring back to life.\n\nAnd then there was the strategy of encouraging \u201cfreedom\u201d (the Bush Doctrine was less a doctrine than a subordinate strategy), as if the denizens of these backwaters were yearning for Jeffersonian Democracy rather than a chance for their own tribe to take charge and get their shot at some prime pillaging.\n\nWhat this turned out to entail was us deploying then going beyond killing the people who needed killing and sticking around afterwards to try to turn populations of Third World psychos into lil\u2019 Norman Rockwell subjects. Sometimes it worked out okay \u2013 Kosovo went fine, though we\u2019ve been there 20 years. Sometimes it went disastrously \u2013 Iraq\u2019s free in the same way Brian Stelter is ripped. And sometimes it just went on and on \u2013 how many decades have we been in Afghanistan again?\n\nIn the hands of our loser elite, now the term \u201cDemocracy\u201d is to American foreign policy as the term \u201cfetch\u201d is to Mean Girls.\n\nI watched Secretary of State Mike Pompeo articulate the Trump Doctrine at this year\u2019s Claremont Institute dinner with the kind of depth and clarity our useless foreign policy elite can only dream of (BTW, you know that the right is embracing conservative wokeness when the loaded donor class boos as pictures of George Will and Paul Ryan flash on-screen). He was remarkable and worth watching. In the hands of Secretary Pompeo and other believers (as opposed to the Deep State moles in the foreign policy bureaucracy), the Trump Doctrine means an on-going re-ordering of our foreign relations priority toward the only proper priority \u2013 American interests.\n\nYou see that when Donald Trump wields US economic power by imposing tariffs (Oh, summon the smelling salts!) on China to finally force it into an equal relationship with the United States. This horrifies those who are quite willing to put up with the PRC\u2019s trade malfeasance because it lines their pockets, or because taking the side of US workers is just too hard, or because zombie Milton Freidman would be sad.\n\nYou see it when Ambassador to Germany Ric Grenell spins the euroweenies into a tizzy by demanding that they stroke checks for their fair share of the NATO bill. My favorite elite talking point is always how demanding members pay the dough they owe to defend against Russia helps Putin because [reasons]. And you also see it when Grenell drops the figurative Adam Schiff in the party punchbowl and demands the Krauts and the Frogs and all the rest stop playing business-as-usual footsie with the mullahs in Tehran.\n\nBut mostly you see it when the President avoids new wars no matter how hard the smart set demands he create his own quagmire. Iran has been ham-handedly trying to provoke a fight by poking our allies. Trump won\u2019t bite. He sees the trap. And in Syria, he is keeping his promise to leave. There\u2019s always a good reason for going into these conflicts (ISIS is bad), and there\u2019s always a good reason to stay (Many Kurds are fine people). But there are better reasons to pack up and leave. The phase \u201cendless war\u201d used to be irritating, except then it became clear that\u2019s exactly what many foreign policy \u201cexperts\u201d are advocating. If your exit criteria for closing out some overseas adventure is \u201cWe can leave when things are stable\u201d in a place that hasn\u2019t been stable in 5000 years, you are advocating for \u201cendless war.\u201d\n\nGetting out of wars requires getting out of wars. And sometimes, it\u2019s going to be ugly. But unless you can explain to the family of a dead soldier why it\u2019s worth it to stay, it\u2019s not worth it to stay. The American people, at least those who aren\u2019t in DC or the media, understand that every problem around the world is not our problem. If you\u2019re one of those Citizens of the World, then feel free to enlist in the Army of the World. Just count us out of your bloody altruism.\n\nIt\u2019s particularly galling to see people you know would screech if Trump used force (like against NATO ally Turkey) screeching because he won\u2019t. President Trump ought to throw this back in their pouty faces and tell them that if the members of the House and Senate are so eager for war, they should avail themselves of the Constitution\u2019s War Powers Clause at Article I, Section 8, Clause 11, and declare one. Let them sign on the line that is dotted if they\u2019re so psyched to rumble in Whocaresistan.\n\nBut they won\u2019t. Our representatives know full well that the people back home voting next November don\u2019t think like the smarmy suits from McLean and Foggy Bottom these elected officials mingle with over cocktails in Georgetown. The American people have had enough of stupid trade deals, of stupid border shenanigans and of stupid wars.\n\nThe Trump Doctrine is really just a fancy name for the common sense view that America\u2019s leaders should use American power to advance the interests of Americans. And that\u2019s why the elite hates it.\n\nWe\u2019re in a struggle for the future of our country \u2013 are we going to be citizens or serfs? See how both fates play out in my action-packed yet hilarious novels of America torn apart by liberal insanity, People's Republic, Indian Country and Wildfire (plus Book Number IV comes out this November)!
