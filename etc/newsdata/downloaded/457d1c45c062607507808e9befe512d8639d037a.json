She was a very popular lady.\n\n'[Now], she has become a frailer version of herself. It's as if she is slowly fading in every aspect - physically, mentally and just in who she is. It's like she's being erased by [dementia].\n\n'I'd never seen the first photograph of Gill before - it was sent to me by one of her friends who was down at a Women's Royal Naval Service reunion this weekend.\n\n'It knocked me sideways really. I got quite upset. The photograph was the last time Gill went [to the reunion] four years ago. That's what hit me. I knew how much it meant to her.\n\nThe family are pictured with Georgia, 26, left, Gill, 56, centre, Dominic, 55, and Emily, 30,\n\nMr Cardall, from Congleton in Cheshire, said: 'It's horrible really, to see that change.'

[Dementia] can happen to anyone.\n\nWhat is young onset dementia? Dementia is considered 'young onset' when it affects people under 65 years of age. It is also referred to as 'early onset' or 'working age' dementia. However this is an arbitary age distinction which is becoming less relevant as increasingly services are realigned to focus on the person and the impact of the condition, not the age. Dementia is a degeneration of the brain that causes a progressive decline in people's ability to think, reason, communicate and remember. Their personality, behaviour and mood can also be affected. Everyone's experience of dementia is unique and the progression of the condition varies. Some symptoms are more likely to occur with certain types of dementia. Dementias that affect younger people can be rare and difficult to recognise. People can also be very reluctant to accept there is anything wrong when they are otherwise fit and well, and they may put off visiting their doctor. Signs and symptoms: Memory loss that disrupts daily life Challenges in planning or solving problems Difficulty in completing tasks at home, work or leisure Confusion with time or place Trouble understanding visual images or spatial relationships New problems with words in speaking or writing Misplacing things and losing the ability to retrace steps Decreased or poor judgement Withdrawal from work or social activities Changes in mood and personality Source: Young Dementia UK\n\n'Gill now needs 24-hour care, including her personal care and feeding. She has to have pureed food because of swallowing and choking issues.\n\n'Her fluids are all thickened to make them like wallpaper paste. She's also losing a lot of weight. We can't keep the weight on her because of her eating issues.'\n\nGill and Dominic married in 1986 while they both worked for the Royal Navy in Plymouth, before leaving two years later to start a family.\n\nThey have two daughters, Emily, 30, and Georgia, 26, who now help with their mother's care.\n\nBoth girls still lived at home when their mother first became ill, and they noticed her starting to struggle with her speech.\n\nMr Cardall said: 'The first sign that anything was wrong was Gill started to have speech problems.\n\n'At first we didn't know what it was. She'd say the wrong word in a sentence or get a word mixed up.\n\n'It progressed over the next couple of months where she was having real problems with her speech, then her work contacted me to say she was having difficulties.\n\n'We saw the GP and what was flagging it up for me was Gill's mum had Alzheimer's and her eldest sister, Anne, had dementia.\n\n'Gill's condition is a type of frontal temporal dementia. It affects the speech element of the brain. She'd get words mixed up or couldn't find the right word.\n\n'For example, she asked me to 'get her handbag out of the carton'. She didn't realise she wasn't saying car.\n\n'That was one of the things I realised she was adamant about. It wasn't a slip of the tongue.\n\n'We always called the TV remote control the 'zapper'. But she would say 'can you pass me, that tele-pointer thing'.\n\n'She'd say 'I'd like a cup of hot water with a bag in it', rather than a cup of tea.\n\n'Her brain was trying to work things out but getting them wrong, or mixed up.'\n\nMrs Cardall's family had a history of dementia and Alzheimer's, with her husband admitting he feared from the beginning it was his wife's fate.\n\nThe Cardalls are pictured with their daughter Georgia at her graduation ceremony before her mother was diagnosed with dementia\n\nAs her speech deteriorated, he noticed her personality beginning to change.\n\nWHAT IS DEMENTIA? Dementia is an umbrella term used to describe a range of progressive neurological disorders, that is, conditions affecting the brain. There are many different types of dementia, of which Alzheimer's disease is the most common. Some people may have a combination of types of dementia. Regardless of which type is diagnosed, each person will experience their dementia in their own unique way. Dementia is a global concern but it is most often seen in wealthier countries, where people are likely to live into very old age. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED? The Alzheimer's Society reports there are more than 850,000 people living with dementia in the UK today, of which more than 500,000 have Alzheimer's. It is estimated that the number of people living with dementia in the UK by 2025 will rise to over 1 million. In the US, it's estimated there are 5.5 million Alzheimer's sufferers. A similar percentage rise is expected in the coming years. As a person's age increases, so does the risk of them developing dementia. Rates of diagnosis are improving but many people with dementia are thought to still be undiagnosed. IS THERE A CURE? Currently there is no cure for dementia. But new drugs can slow down its progression and the earlier it is spotted the more effective treatments are.

She became less empathetic. She was always the most kind, loving person you could ever meet.\n\n'I remember one of the girls came in and they'd passed something, an exam or a test, and Gill was completely blank about it.\n\n'She also became very sharp with people, as if her inhibitions had gone completely. We'd go to a cafe and Gill would shout the waiter 'coffee, coffee!'\n\n'That was not her, so we knew something had gone wrong.'\n\nAt the end of 2015, the mother-of-two was booked to see a specialist at Salford Royal's cerebral function unit and after the first appointment, she was diagnosed with 'advanced' dementia.\n\nOnly eight months after her diagnosis, the couple had planned to renew their vows, but after writing them together, Mrs Cardall was unable to read them.\n\nMr Cardall said: '[The diagnosis] was a little bit of a relief. At least we knew then what it was.\n\n'But also it's a double edged sword, the diagnosis, because then you know what's coming.\n\n'Gill was in complete denial. She'd just keep saying 'it's just my speech, it's not dementia'. It progressed really quickly. She'd lost virtually all her speech by August 2016.\n\n'It was our 30th wedding anniversary around that time and I arranged for us to renew our vows down in Plymouth, where we'd both served in the navy.\n\n'She was determined to say the vows we'd written together and she couldn't do it when we went to church. She couldn't physically get them out.\n\nGill and Dominic Cardall are pictured on their wedding day more than 30 years ago\n\n'It was fine, she wasn't upset about it, but pretty soon after that she lost her voice completely.\n\n'She was still writing things down, but that soon turned into symbols or squiggles. She'd just scribble circles that didn't make any sense.'\n\nBefore: Gill Cardall is pictured before her diagnosis in 2015\n\nWithin two years, Mrs Cardall was confined to a wheelchair as she struggled to walk properly. Stepping off the bottom step of her stairs 'terrified' her.\n\nIn the last 18 months, an occupation therapist has helped the family adapt their home for Mrs Cardall, who now sleeps in their old dining room.\n\nHer husband added: 'We went to see the specialist two years ago. He said at the point she was in the advanced stages and that things would get progressively worse, and they have.\n\n'Gill is in a wheelchair full time now. Quite quickly she had problems with working out how to get in and out of a chair.\n\n'Trying to sit down was terrifying for her. She couldn't work it out. That progressed to walking and stepping downstairs.\n\n'We'd manage to get her down the stairs and she'd spend 20 minutes trying to get off the bottom steps.\n\n'She couldn't move her right leg and would shuffle along.\n\n'We borrowed a wheeled walking frame with a seat which she used for a while, but then quite quickly within a couple of months she couldn't coordinate that.\n\nHappier times: The Cardall family from Cheshire are pictured at a fancy dress party\n\n'It was difficult to get her in and out of the car because she couldn't work out how to sit in it properly. I'd spend ages trying to get her to sit right. She couldn't get in and out of her chair without help to lift her.\n\n'We then needed equipment which the occupational therapist provided. We had mobile hoists and swings, but soon we couldn't use those as she couldn't hold her weight up.\n\n'Now we have a room that was the dining room converted into a bedroom for her downstairs. That's fully adapted.'\n\nPictured: Gill Cardall during her Royal Navy days in Plymouth in the 1980s\n\nMr Cardall is urging people 'to push' for a diagnosis if they notice something isn't right.\n\nAlthough he finds comfort in his family, he admits there is little support out there for victims of early-onset dementia.\n\nHe said: 'If you think there's a change in your speech or personality, get to the doctor's straight away. People need to push.\n\n'In groups I'm in [online], so many people have said their loved ones were diagnosed with depression or anxiety before being diagnosed with a form of dementia.\n\n'There's a lot of misdiagnosis - especially with the rarer forms of dementia. I found a lot of information on the Alzheimer's UK website.\n\n'I know they say you shouldn't self diagnose things, but the symptoms we had were absolutely spot on.\n\n'The other really good help, because of Gill's age, was YoungDementia UK, because there's hardly anything out there for people with young onset dementia.\n\n'Everything is focused towards older people and this is why I want to raise awareness.\n\n'The groups that are held by charities are all sing-along groups or coffee mornings and focused on older people.\n\n'Gill loved music but she didn't like Vera Lynn, she wanted to listen to Rick Astley. There's a hole in the whole system.'", "description": "Gill Cardall, 56, of Congelton, Cheshire, was diagnosed with a form of dementia called progressive non-fluent aphasia in December 2015.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/10/20369016-0-image-a-78_1572431289204.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
