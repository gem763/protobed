Instead, posturing MPs subjected us to yet more agonising delay.\u2019\n\nThe Sunday Express features a front page picture of a glum looking Boris Johnson and a headline asking \u2018Why won\u2019t they let us leave?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut The Observer applauded the MPs who caused another delay in the Brexit process saying Boris Johnson \u2018is a prime minister without a mandate\u2019.\n\nMP\u2019s who supported the Letwin amendment were labelled the \u2018Brexit wreckers\u2019 by The Times (Picture: The Sunday Times)\n\nThe Observer argued MPs were given very little time to study the terms of the most important decision the country has faced in decades (Picture: The Observer)\n\n\u2018He has never faced an election and has lost every vote he has put to the House of Commons,\u2019 the paper said in its editorial.\n\nIt said MPs were given very little time to study the terms of the most important decision the country has faced in decades.\n\nIt said: \u2018(Mr Johnson) miscalculated badly.\n\n\u2018Parliament reasserted its sovereignty, voting to withhold approval of his EU deal until MPs have a chance to scrutinise the relevant legislation, effectively forcing him by law to request an extension from the EU.\u2019\n\nThe Sunday Mirror\u2019s front page deatures a one word headline: \u2018Humiliated.\u2019\n\nIt goes on to say that Mr Johnson has been \u2018forced to beg\u2019 the EU for another Brexit delay.\n\nBut The Sunday Telegraph\u2019s editorial reads: \u2018All is not lost if Tories get behind the PM.\u2019\n\nIt adds: \u2018This dithering and disgraced Parliament made a complete fool of itself yesterday.\n\n\u2018Instead of voting in sensible order on the new Brexit deal \u2013 for which the Government seemed so tantalisingly close to a majority \u2013 it passed Sir Oliver Letwin\u2019s preposterous amendment, kicking Brexit into the long grass yet again.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe paper ended its editorial with what it calls a \u2018recipe to restore trust in British politics\u2019, saying: \u2018We must leave the EU as soon as possible and we need a new generation of MPs who remember exactly who put them there.\u2019\n\nWhile the Express described Mr Johnson as \u2018defiant\u2019 (Picture: Sunday Express)\n\nWhile the Mail on Sunday branded MP\u2019s the \u2018House of Fools\u2019 (Picture: The Mail)\n\nThis morning, shadow chancellor John McDonnell has insisted Mr Johnson may be in contempt of Parliament over his decision to distance himself from a Brexit extension.\n\nMr McDonnell hit out at the way the prime minister sent the legally required request to the EU for a Brexit delay \u2013 which he refused to sign.\n\nThe Labour MP accused Mr Johnson of \u2018behaving a bit like a spoilt brat\u2019 after he stressed to Brussels he was only sending the communication at Parliament\u2019s bidding.\n\nSpeaking on Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Mr McDonnell said: \u2018He may well be in contempt of Parliament or the courts themselves because he\u2019s clearly trying to undermine the first letter and not signing the letter.\n\n\u2018Parliament made a decision, he should abide by it and this idea that you send another letter contradicting the first, I think it flies in the face of what both Parliament and the courts have decided.\u2019\n\nThe PM rang European leaders, including Mr Tusk, on Saturday night declaring that the letter \u2018is Parliament\u2019s letter, not my letter\u2019.\n\nThe Benn Act set a deadline of 11pm on Saturday for the Prime Minister to get a deal if the UK is to leave on October 31, otherwise he is supposed to seek an extension.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said the Government was planning to give MPs a fresh chance to have a \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 on the deal hammered out by Mr Johnson with Brussels on Monday.\n\nSpeaker John Bercow said he would rule on Monday whether it was in order for the Government to hold the vote, after not pressing ahead with it on Saturday following its defeat on the Letwin amendment.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
