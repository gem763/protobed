As I said, the government and the people of Queensland decide when they close. No-one else,\" Dr Lynham said.\n\n\"Unlike in southern states - where power stations are privately-owned - the government will decide when power stations are retired.\n\n\"And in the future when we do, as the renewable energy transition continues, the local communities and the workers will be looked after under our transition policies.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCFMEU mining and energy division Queensland president Steve Smyth said the closure of Callide B would have a big impact in Central Queensland, with no obvious reliable replacement for coal-fired power.\n\n\"There will be job losses and it will have a massive effect on the local community,\" he said.\n\n\"Again these decisions being suggested and still no evidence of how other power generation will ensure cheap and reliable power. I don't believe a lot of these so called experts really understand the effect of wanting to shut down the coal industry.\"\n\nDr Lynham - who has admitted the state's coal-fired power stations would be squeezed out of the grid by renewable energy projects, but not before 2030 - said Queensland's coal fleet was the youngest in the nation and the stations were maintained to ensure their reliability.\n\nPremier Annastacia Palaszczuk's government is particularly sensitive to criticism about the coal sector after it was accused of doing a \"go slow\" on approvals for Adani's $2 billion Carmichael mine, which contributed to Labor's poor showing in Queensland in the federal election.\n\nAEMO's latest database of generating unit closures shows the state-owned 1680 megawatt Gladstone power station will stay open for five more years than expected and was now scheduled to close in 2035.\n\nAnother state-owned coal-fired power station in Queensland, the 1400 megawatt Tarong facility, will close in 2036-37 as planned, while the newer 1445 megawatt Stanwell plant, which was commissioned in 1993, will not close until 2044-45.\n\nClean energy advocates welcomed the news about the proposed earlier closure of Callide B, saying it made sense in the move to a low-emissions economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Significant advance notice of the closure of Callide B power station allows ample time for new investment in renewable energy and energy storage to ensure the Queensland energy system remains reliable and energy prices affordable,\" Clean Energy Council chief executive Kane Thornton said.\n\n\"This will also make further progress on Queensland's 50 per cent renewable energy target.\"\n\nThe federal and NSW governments in August launched a taskforce to examine the closure of the Liddell power plant and ensure there was not a repeat of the Hazelwood closure.\n\nOther key coal-fired power plant closures in the grid include Sunset Power's Vales Point in 2028, EnergyAustralia's Yallourn plant in Victoria in 2032 and AGL Energy's Bayswater in 2035.", "description": "The federal energy minister warned Queensland is risking a repeat of the \"mess\" in Victoria created with the early closure of the Hazelwood power station.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2373%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_11/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e57dcb741ff017b51f809c95dae351d36237bd92", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
