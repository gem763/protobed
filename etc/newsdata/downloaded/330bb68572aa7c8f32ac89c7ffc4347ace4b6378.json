But the Turkish assault has diverted their attention, as US forces have also suspended operations against ISIS as the Pentagon announced the US is withdrawing the remaining troops in northern Syria on top of the small group already relocated.\n\nOver the weekend, hundreds of ISIS-related detainees escaped from a prison camp in northern Syria.\n\nTrump suggested the escape may have been the work of the Kurds to bait him back into Syria, but there\u2019s no evidence of this and Defense Secretary Mark Esper subsequently blamed Turkey.\n\n\u201cThis unacceptable incursion has also undermined the successful multinational \u2018Defeat ISIS\u2019 mission in Syria, and resulted in the release of many dangerous ISIS detainees,\u201d Esper said in a statement.\n\nThe Turkish military operation is a direct result of Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US forces from northeast Syria and the move \u2013 which Trump announced after a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2013 was widely seen as a greenlight to Erdogan to begin his long-desired assault on the Kurds.\n\nRead more: Trump\u2019s coziness with authoritarians is backfiring spectacularly in Syria\n\nThe White House has rejected the notion he paved the way for the Turkish operation. But in announcing the abrupt withdrawal of US troops from the region last Sunday, the Trump administration said: \u201cTurkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria\u2026United States forces, having defeated the ISIS territorial \u2018Caliphate,\u2019 will no longer be in the immediate area.\u201d\n\nAs Brett McGurk, Trump\u2019s former top US envoy for the fight against ISIS, put it in a tweet on Tuesday, \u201cTrump administration officials are working overtime to say he never gave the green light to this disastrous gift to ISIS, Russia, and Iran. I don\u2019t envy them. But it\u2019s demonstrably false.\u201d\n\nHere is the statement from Sunday night with no warning whatsoever. That\u2019s called a green light.???? pic.twitter.com/uf5I2Ni5r3 \u2014 Brett McGurk (@brett_mcgurk) October 15, 2019\n\n\u201cThe disaster unfolding tonight in Syria was predictable from the moment Trump made clear he wanted to leave,\u201d McGurk said in a separate tweet on Sunday.\n\nTrump handed a big victory to Assad and Putin\n\nWithin the first week of the Turkish operation, both the Pentagon and the United Nations have warned there are already signs war crimes have been committed against the Kurds by Turkish-backed Syrian Arab forces.\n\nIn this context, and having been abandoned by the US, the Kurds have turned to Damascus and its allies in Moscow for protection against the Turkish assault.\n\nThe US moved out, and its adversaries capitalized on it.\n\n\u201cAfter the Americans abandoned the region and gave the green light for the Turkish attack, we were forced to explore another option, which is talks with Damascus and Moscow to find a way out and thwart these Turkish attacks,\u201d senior Kurdish official Badran Jia Kurd said. \u201cThis is a preliminary military agreement. The political aspects were not discussed, and these will be discussed at later stages.\u201d\n\nTrump seemingly has no problem with this, and has presented the chaos in Syria as a distant problem.\n\nThe president on Monday tweeted; \u201cAnyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte. I hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!\u201d\n\nRussian troops have now moved into areas abandoned by US forces, in one of the biggest physical indications Moscow is filling the void created by Trump\u2019s retreat.\n\nVideo scenes from Manbij #Syria this morning.

The US partnership with Kurdish forces placed strains on relations between Washington and Ankara.\n\nBut if Trump originally hoped to improve relations with Turkey via this move, it\u2019s backfired spectacularly as he faces mounting pressure in Congress to punish Erdogan over the Syria operation.\n\nAmerica\u2019s credibility is in tatters\n\nCritics of Trump\u2019s decision to abandon the Kurds say he\u2019s sent a dangerous message to other allies and potential partners that the US cannot be relied upon.\n\nEuropean leaders have slammed the US withdrawal, as they express concerns about new security threats posed by ISIS as well as the escalating humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said the situation could allow ISIS to \u201cre-find its breathing space inside that territory\u201d and poses a direct threat to European security.\n\nRead more: Trump defends abandoning the Kurds by saying they didn\u2019t help the US in WWII\n\nNorbert R\u00f6ttgen, the chairman of the German parliament\u2019s foreign affairs committee, told The Washington Post: \u201cIn withdrawing US troops from Northern Syria, Trump not only let his Kurdish allies down, he also enabled the Turkish invasion in the first place.\u201d\n\nR\u00f6ttgen added that as a result of Trump\u2019s decision, \u201cUS credibility has been badly damaged\u201d and \u201cregional stability is now at serious risk.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell on Monday said that if US troops had not withdrawn from northeast Syria then the Turkish invasion would not have been possible. He added: \u201cThe American troop withdrawal was a condition in order to make the attack possible.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - ISIS is regrouping in Syria, US credibility has been badly damaged on the global stage, and Russia is the biggest winner of all..
