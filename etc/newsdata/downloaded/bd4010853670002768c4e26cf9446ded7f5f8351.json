Last week, the beans were offered at $300 premiums to the December contract.\n\n\"There was hardly any trade with supply depleted and little demand from buyers,\" a trader said.\n\n($1 = 23,203 dong)", "description": "Asia Coffee-Vietnam prices rebound, Indonesia market dull", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/Coffee_800x533_L_1421322814.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
