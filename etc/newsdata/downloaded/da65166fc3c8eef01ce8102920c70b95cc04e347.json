One is a policewoman the other works in a beauty salon.\n\n\"When my mother calls me, she always asks me about my studies first. Did you do your homework, or you must finish that presentation.\n\n\"Then she asks about football like who are you playing against and about my life and how I'm getting on.\"\n\nThe former Mamelodi Sundowns forward explained that he graduated last year but decided to now do his post graduate degree.\n\nHe said that he fits his studying time between training, playing and traveling.\n\nTau added: \"I'm doing a postgraduate degree in management - researching strategic management.\n\n\"It all comes down to time management. I can do my research on my phone and if I don't understand something, I ask for an explanation by e-mail.\n\n\"But that happens less and less. I do research on my own. When I come across something interesting, I take a screenshot and save it.\n\n\"If I have to go to a library or some other institution I will ask for help.\"\n\n- TeamTalk", "description": "Bafana Bafana star Percy Tau has a busy football career but insists that he is determined to continue his studies while excelling on the field.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9466/b5f71f489be747c5bf58252eb0c21cd6.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
