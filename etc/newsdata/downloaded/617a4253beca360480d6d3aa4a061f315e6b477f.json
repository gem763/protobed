I just keep getting messages from people saying, \"F the begrudgers\", and I keep thinking, \"What's going on?\".\n\n'We are within a win of qualifying and I just don't get the sense of anticipation or excitement - and there should be.\n\n'I've been asked if it is a cup final. No, but I'm excited about it. I'm excited about the prospect of winning.'\n\nIt is two years since Ireland won away against a higher-ranked team and, after the toil of Georgia, McCarthy looks set to start Connolly, who made his debut as a late substitute in Tbilisi.\n\nA win for Ireland in Switzerland will guarantee qualification for Euro 2020 next summer\n\n'Asking me would I risk him, there's some suggestion that there is - I don't think there is a risk,' said McCarthy.\n\n'He's had a cameo and did well in it and I think he will be feeling comfortable about himself.'\n\nSo he is starting?\n\n'If you can deduce that from my tone of voice, well fair play to you,' said McCarthy. 'I might just drop him to spite you now\u2026'\n\nMcCarthy will be hoping that the mischievous grin he wore on his face will be replaced by a winning one on Tuesday evening - do that and he will deservedly get the credit he craves.", "description": "CRAIG HOPE IN TBILSI: The subject of Aaron Connolly and whether he will start the Brighton teenager caused McCarthy to bristle, even though he hinted that will be the case.", "authors": ["Craig Hope For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/19/19705038-0-image-a-27_1571076882187.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
