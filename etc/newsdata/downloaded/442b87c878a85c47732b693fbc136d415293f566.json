That call \u2014 which Trump has vowed to release as an unredacted transcript \u2014 has been the focus of increasing calls for his impeachment if the conversation proves to have involved a quid pro quo offer: seeking Ukraine\u2019s help to get dirt on Biden in exchange for military aid to the country.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe White House setting offers the president a backdrop of law and order even as the impeachment process enters its most intense phase yet. Many of the sheriffs planning to attend the meeting, which will also include acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, are in Washington this week for a conference focused on immigration and border security hosted by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group with close ties to the Trump White House that supports reducing overall levels of immigration to the United States. The sheriffs will urge Trump to continue pushing for immigration reform measures that have tormented Congress for years, according to three sources with knowledge of the meeting.\n\n\u201cThey want to see some type of action. They want to create a sense of urgency on this,\u201d one of those sources said, adding that more than 100 sheriffs will gather with Republican lawmakers and so-called \u201cAngel Families\u201d outside the Capitol on Wednesday to outline their concerns about the current standstill on immigration policy.\n\nA similar news conference held last year was attended by Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), who was recently rebuked by the Democrat-controlled House for a series of eyebrow-raising comments on race, and White House counselor Kellyanne Conway.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3888/1155968404_6089163104001_6089162887001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nThe meeting between Trump and local sheriffs comes as the White House prepares to release draft legislation that aims to fix loopholes in the legal immigration system and enhance border security. Administration officials have begun circulating the draft to stakeholders, just weeks after White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, who is at the center of the latest immigration push, told GOP senators their party would be wise to unify behind one plan ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nBut some White House officials have pressured the president and Kushner to shelve immigration \u2014 an issue Trump\u2019s base cares deeply about \u2014 until 2020, despite concerns that Democrats will be even less likely to work across the aisle in an election year and as an impeachment inquiry plays out.\n\nThese officials say the president should focus this fall on passing the USMCA, a renegotiated version of NAFTA that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has so far declined to put to a floor vote, tackling prescription drug costs and avoiding a partial government shutdown when a stopgap spending bill \u2014 which is expected to pass the Senate this week \u2014 expires just before Thanksgiving.\n\nThat laundry list does not include new gun control legislation, which the White House previously said it planned to get behind after back-to-back mass shootings in August. The president has yet to release any gun-related framework that Republicans can rally around, partly because of the conflicting advice he\u2019s receiving from his adult children Ivanka and Don Jr., as POLITICO reported Monday.\n\nRather, the president has remained fixed on immigration \u2014 touting the success of his administration\u2019s partnership with Mexican officials at the southern border, defending his use of military construction funds to break ground on new border wall, and celebrating a recent Supreme Court decision to undo a lower court ruling that barred the administration from enforcing new rules for asylum seekers. Trump even used a portion of his remarks at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday to smack down critics of his immigration actions.\n\n\u201cYour policies are not just. Your policies are cruel and evil,\u201d he told a roomful of foreign leaders, referring to those who favor \u201copen borders.\u201d\n\nWhen the sheriffs participating in Thursday\u2019s meeting arrive for their sit-down with Trump, it\u2019s unlikely everyone in the room will be as enthusiastic as the president about his recent actions on immigration.\n\nMorning Shift newsletter Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

After delivering brief remarks about immigration, Trump left the 30-plus law enforcement officials standing behind him as he fielded questions from reporters about a critical op-ed published in the New York Times by an anonymous official inside his administration.\n\n\u201cHey, I\u2019ll ask the sheriffs: Can you imagine? We have somebody in what I call the \u2018failing New York Times\u2019 that\u2019s talking about he\u2019s part of the resistance within the Trump administration,\u201d Trump told his guests.\n\n\u201cIt kind of took some of our members off guard last year,\u201d said an official with one organization representing law enforcement.\n\nSome members of the group, which will send its executive director to Thursday\u2019s meeting but avoided involvement in planning it, were upset last year when their colleagues told Trump they support all that his administration is doing on the immigration front. \u201cThe spokespeople said last year, \u2018We support everything you do,\u2019 and that\u2019s not the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of our members \u2014 especially our leaders \u2014 are more middle of the road,\u201d the official added.\n\nA White House official did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nShould the Trump administration\u2019s anticipated immigration plan fail to gain traction on Capitol Hill \u2014 as some Senate GOP offices have privately predicted it will \u2014 the president has already teased a fallback message that largely focuses on his long-promised border wall. As he stood beside a segment of the wall last week that is under construction near San Diego, Trump said his advisers \u201cthink we can get it close to 500 miles by the end of next year, depending on certain terrain conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can fry an egg on that wall. It\u2019s very, very hot,\u201d he added, previewing a line he\u2019s likely to recycle on the campaign trail in the months ahead.", "description": "A White House gathering of sheriffs to discuss immigration will take place as Democrats accuse the president of subverting the Constitution.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/92/a6/794f01b646feb8d6ce8fa98e479a/20190924-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
