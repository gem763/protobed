In total, three rounds of tariffs imposed would impact $250 billion in US products if enforced -- a potential future unless US and Chinese leaders break the trade war impasse.\n\nThe Trump Administration has implied that other tariffs may also be imposed in the future unless terms are agreed upon.\n\nHuawei was added to the US Entity List, which includes vendors disallowed from trading with US companies on the grounds of national security unless approved by the government. Recently, eight new Chinese technology companies were added to the list for allegedly being involved in the suppression of Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities.\n\nIn addition, 20 Chinese public security bureaus have been added to the list.\n\nCNET: Huawei ban: Full timeline as Mate 30 phones lose backdoor Google app access\n\nIn Huawei's case, the tech giant was given a reprieve until November to continue trading with the US in order to give partners the opportunity to keep existing networks and equipment functional until alternative arrangements could be made.\n\nThe report surfaced at the time the US and China are on the brink of the 13th round of trade talks aimed at agreeing on a resolution satisfactory to both parties to end the tariff war.\n\nThe ongoing trade battle could impact US companies based in China, too. Recently, government officials confirmed that the president does have the power to force American firms out of China -- but no such orders have yet been made.\n\nHuawei, as one of the world's most popular smartphone vendors, has not only suffered when it comes to purchasing components and materials from US companies, but also when it comes to its product lines. Inclusion on the Entity List, even with a temporary license to continue trade, has thrown the operating system of future handsets in doubt.\n\nTechRepublic: Huawei's new smartphone operating system is 'completely different from Android and iOS'\n\nWith the partnership between Huawei and Google in disarray, the use of the Android mobile OS has been, too. Without the full assurance that future Android handsets would be able to receive updates, Huawei has developed an alternative operating system called Harmony, or Hong Meng.\n\nThe temporary license still holds and the Chinese tech giant does not want to fragment its ecosystem unless absolutely necessary -- and so, for now, no handsets will be launched during 2019 with the new 'plan B' operating system.\n\nTo bring the point home, a new variant of the P30 Pro smartphone is shipping with the latest version of Android this year.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
