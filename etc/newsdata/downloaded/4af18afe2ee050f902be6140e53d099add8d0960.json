He is working very hard on the Amazon fires and in all respects doing a great job for the people of Brazil - Not easy. He and his country have the full and complete support of the USA!\u201d (President Trump Tweet, Aug. 27.)\n\n\"In recent months we have seen also a shrinking of civic and democratic space (in Brazil) highlighted by documented attacks against human rights defenders, restrictions on the work of civil society and attacks on educational institutions.\" (Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and President of Chile from 2006 to 2010 and again from 2014 to 2018.)\n\nOther items of interest on Bachelet\u2019s C.V. which aren\u2019t often mentioned by the mainstream media: Bachelet\u2019s family served as apparatchiks in Salvador Allende\u2019s Soviet/Cuba-run regime from 1970-73, and were arrested after Pinochet\u2019s coup. Michelle herself, while in college, was a member of Chile\u2019s Socialist Youth (Communist) organization. In 1974 she was arrested and briefly detained. Upon release, this hallowed spokeswoman for human rights and democracy was welcomed with open arms by machine-gun-and-barbed-wire enclosed Stalinist East Germany where she lived comfortably until returning to Chile in 1979.\n\nCan you imagine the fun Trump might have with a rebuttal tweet to someone with that background who was insulting him? Well, there\u2019s probably good reason why he gets along so well with Jair Bolsonaro:\n\n\"While [Bachelet] says that Brazil is losing democratic space, she forgets that her country is not Cuba thanks only to those who had the courage (Pinochet & Co) to put a stop on the left-wing in 1973....among the communists during that era was her brigadier father\u2026When you have people with nothing to do, they occupy the UN human rights chair.\u201d (Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Facebook, Sept. 4.)\n\nFascinating items regarding recent Chilean history which aren\u2019t often mentioned by the mainstream media:\n\n\"We\u2019re following the example of the Cuban Revolution and counting on the support of her militant internationalism represented by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara!\u201d boasted Chilean president Salvador Allende\u2019s minister Carlos Altamirano in January 1971. \u201cArmed conflict in continental terms remains as relevant today as ever!\" he declared.\n\nAnd he wasn\u2019t bluffing. By the time of Pinochet\u2019s coup, an estimated 31,000 Cuban and Soviet bloc operatives and terrorists infested Chile, including Castro\u2019s top KGB-trained terrorist spymasters, Antonio De La Guardia and Manuel \"Barbarroja\" Pineiro. Among the hundreds of Soviet personnel were KGB luminaries Viktor Efremov, Vasili Stepanov and Nikolai Kotchanov.\n\nBy 1973, 60% of Chile\u2019s arable land had been stolen by Allende\u2019s Marxist regime, often with the aid of Cuba-trained death squads. \"In the final analysis only armed conflict will decide who is the victor!\" added Allende\u2019s governmental ally, Oscar Guillermo Garreton. \u201cThe class struggle always entails armed conflict. Understand me, the global strategy is always accomplished through arms!\"\n\nAllende\u2019s deputy economic minister, Sergio Ramos, didn\u2019t mince words either: \"It\u2019s evident,\" he proclaimed in mid-1973, \"that the transition to socialism will first require a dictatorship of the proletariat!\"\n\n\"Stalin was a banner of creativity, of humanism and an edifying picture of peace and heroism!\" declared Salvador Allende during a eulogy in 1953. \"Our father Stalin has died but in remembering his example our affection for him will cause our arms to grow strong towards building a grand tomorrow\u2014to insure a future in memory of his grand example!\"\n\nIn September 1973 General Augusto Pinochet, his military colleagues and a majority of the Chilean people (Allende had won in 1970 with a slight plurality not a majority of the Chilean vote) failed to recognize Stalin\u2019s Great Terror as a \u201cgrand example.\u201d The Chilean legislature and Supreme Court had already declared Allende\u2019s Marxism unconstitutional.\n\nSo with the clock ticking ominously toward irreversible Castroism, Chile\u2019s traditionally un-political military made a (genuine) pinprick strike against Allende and his Stalinist minions.\n\nAllende and Castro\u2019s media minions claim 3000 people were \u201cdisappeared\u201d during this anti-Communist coup and its aftermath, collateral damage and all. Well, even if we accept the Castroite figure, compared to the death-toll from our interventions/ bombing campaigns in the Middle East (that have yet to create a single free, peaceful and prosperous nation) Pinochet\u2019s coup should be enshrined and studied at West Point, Georgetown and John Hopkins as the paradigm for effective \u201cregime\u2013change\u201d and \u201cnation-building.\u201d Granted, Pinochet had much better raw material to work with.\n\nBut the Castroite\u2013MSM figure is mostly bogus, as many of those \u201cdisappeared\u201d kept appearing, usually behind the iron curtain. (Take Michelle Bachelet herself\u2014please!)\n\nMore importantly, Pinochet and his plotters were scrupulous in keeping U.S. State Department and CIA \u201cnation-builders\u201d and other such liberal egghead busybodies out of their plotting loop. (This probably explains Pinochet\u2019s success.) Then two years after the coup they invited free-market economist Milton Friedman and his \u201cChicago Boys\u201d over for some economic tutelage. Consequently: today Chile is probably the freest and richest nation in Latin America.\n\nAnd oh!...by the way, a couple of years ago, during the Brazilian administration of crypto-commie Lula da Silva, your humble servant got word that\u2014get this:\n\nChe Guevara t-shirts were being burned in demonstrations against Bolsonaro\u2019s crypto-commie predecessor! My Brazilian informants (publishers) further informed that some of the demonstrators were seen openly brandishing copies of a book that had recently been translated and published in Brazil! As proof they even sent a few brief clips.", "description": "\u201cI have gotten to know President Bolsonaro well in our .09/08/2019 7:40:09AM EST.", "authors": ["Humberto Fontova", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/143/91546319-519c-44a1-8444-c90a1fa11916.png", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
