Ex-dividend means that investors that purchase the stock on or after the 30th of October will not receive this dividend, which will be paid on the 6th of November.\n\nCyient's next dividend payment will be \u20b96.0 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of \u20b915.0 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Cyient stock has a trailing yield of around 3.7% on the current share price of \u20b9405.05. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether Cyient can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Cyient\n\nIf a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fortunately Cyient's payout ratio is modest, at just 36% of profit. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It paid out 84% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is within usual limits but will limit the company's ability to lift the dividend if there's no growth.\n\nIt's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.\n\nNSEI:CYIENT Historical Dividend Yield, October 26th 2019 More\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nStocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. For this reason, we're glad to see Cyient's earnings per share have risen 12% per annum over the last five years. It paid out more than three-quarters of its earnings in the last year, even though earnings per share are growing rapidly. Higher earnings generally bode well for growing dividends, although with seemingly strong growth prospects we'd wonder why management are not reinvesting more in the business.\n\nThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, ten years ago, Cyient has lifted its dividend by approximately 35% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nHas Cyient got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share have grown at a nice rate in recent times and over the last year, Cyient paid out less than half its earnings and a bit over half its free cash flow. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.\n\nEver wonder what the future holds for Cyient?
