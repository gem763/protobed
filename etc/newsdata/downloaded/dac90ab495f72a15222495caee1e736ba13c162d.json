West Ham visit Goodison Park with the manager desperate for a result to escape the bottom three.\n\nAlthough the pressure is intensifying, Silva feels reassured by owner Farhad Moshiri saying his position does not hinge on the outcome of Saturday\u2019s game.\n\nBut he also accepted there must be a rapid transformation to get the club out of trouble.\n\n\"It [the sack] is not something that is ever in my mind because when I\u2019m winning five or six games I\u2019m not thinking if I win I will renew the contract and get three years more,\" said Silva.\n\n\"It is something that doesn\u2019t stay in my mind. A manager doesn\u2019t have to lose one second to even think in this situation. We have to go with, \u2018we worked well during the week, we have planned everything well, tomorrow our players they will perform well playing in our stadium and we have to show togetherness to win a football match\u2019. The other things I don\u2019t lose one second thinking about that.\"", "description": "Marco Silva is not contemplating being sacked should Everton suffer a fifth consecutive league defeat this weekend.", "authors": ["Chris Bascombe", "James Ducker", "Simon Briggs"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/18/213415051_Action-Images-via-Reuters_FILE-PHOTO-Premier-League-Burnley-v-Everton-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqhReA7Q0u4LUCTRHf7LduJlVnOzysl5NOipSEi4jmzF8.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
