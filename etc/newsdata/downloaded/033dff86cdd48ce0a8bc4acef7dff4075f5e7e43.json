And several said it generally shouldn't be done.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m OK with that as long as they play within the confines of the law and don\u2019t go beyond that,\u201d Rep. Ted Yoho Theodore (Ted) Scott YohoGOP lawmakers express concerns about Giuliani's work in Ukraine CNN slams GOP for not appearing on network after mass shootings, conservatives fire back Conservatives call on Pelosi to cancel August recess MORE (R-Fla.) said. \u201cBlanket OK \u2014 no. In certain areas, yes.\u201d\n\nRep. John Curtis (R-Utah) called it \u201cbad form\u201d for outside officials to be tasked with foreign policy.\n\n\u201cMy point is \u2014 this is not the first time this has been done,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything from former secretaries of State being involved with foreign policy to basketball players being involved with foreign policy, and I would say that I think all of those are in bad form.\u201d\n\nThe criticisms show that even in the House, where GOP support for Trump in the impeachment inquiry is strong, some Republicans at a minimum are unnerved with actions by Giuliani and shadow efforts in general.\n\nThese criticisms are echoed in testimony in the impeachment inquiry, with witnesses saying former national security adviser John Bolton John BoltonOn The Money: Trump puts fresh pressure on Fed over rates | White House reportedly delayed Ukraine trade decision | Pence hammers NBA over China controversy White House delayed Ukraine trade decision amid aid hold-up: report Whistleblower exposed much more than Trump's self-dealing MORE called Giuliani a \u201chand grenade\u201d and described his involvement in a diplomatic side channel as a \u201cdrug deal.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoOvernight Defense: Top general briefs GOP senators on Syria plan | Senators 'encouraged' by briefing | Pence huddles with Republican allies on Syria | Trump nominee sidesteps questions on arms treaties Pompeo hints State Dept. will comply with order to release Giuliani communications Pompeo to reporter in Kansas: 'The whole predicate of your question is insane' MORE on Sunday defended Giuliani\u2019s role, however.\n\nIn an appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d he said it was \u201ccompletely appropriate\u201d and that \u201cprivate citizens are often part of executing American foreign policy.\u201d\n\nRepublican strategist Rick Wilson, a frequent critic of Trump\u2019s on cable news, said House GOP members are caught in a dilemma. They risk incurring Trump\u2019s wrath if they refuse to toe the president\u2019s line, but they also don\u2019t want to endorse activities they see as wrong \u2014 especially with polls showing growing support for the impeachment inquiry, especially among independents.\n\n\u201cIf they [Republicans] were being honest with you, they would tell you they know this is a disaster, and they know this is a very bad call on the president and this team,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nWilson said the climate has made it difficult for some Republicans to stay in Washington. He said he\u2019d talked to one retiring House Republican who told him, \u201cI would love to have stayed for years, but I can\u2019t do it in this environment.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, House Republicans this week were offering a firm defense of Trump while attacking the Democratic impeachment process.\n\nRep.

There are rules and regulations governing to diplomatic communications. It's important that there be a consistent strategy amongst all the players.
