The headline reads, \"As a centrist path opens, Pete Buttigieg moves towards it.\"\n\nA close reading, however, shows that the South Bend Mayor really is a neoliberal shapeshifter who bows wherever the wind blows for political expediency and much like his rival Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenSaagar Enjeti questions Warren's authenticity on 'Medicare for all' All-female panel to moderate November Democratic primary debate Ocasio-Cortez grills Zuckerberg over political ad policy MORE avoids specifics on anything controversial to allow himself exactly the type of pivot that he's now exhibiting. The Times shows that in June the mayor was calling for decriminalized border crossings and dismissed criticism of raising taxes on the middle class to pay for health care.\n\nBy October, they say that his pivot to the center entails a climate focused TV ad which says, \"I believe that we need to have a plan that works for us all.\" He later equivocated in a CNN interview about whether he would actually commit to his border promise, and of course he has been attacking Elizabeth Warren for not having a plan to pay for her health care plan during the debate.\n\nThe Times may see a remarkable pivot, but what I and most of you see is exactly the same person. I mean, saying you need a climate plan that works for us all is the definition of meaningless. Paying lip service to the immigration issue in the summer when tensions are high and then not clarifying where you stand in the fall are exactly the same position of opportunism and emptiness.\n\nIt reminds me of a great moment on this show when we all had a great laugh at his first campaign ad:\n\nAs for Medicare-for-All who want it, well. I refuse to believe that the name is not the product of extensive poll testing to gaslight those who want Universal Healthcare and placate the skeptics. On that I appear to be right, the Times tell us in their story that the Mayor's campaign spent three times every other rival campaign on polling save for billionaire Tom Steyer Thomas (Tom) Fahr SteyerAll-female panel to moderate November Democratic primary debate 2020 Democrats criticize Trump invoking lynching: 'Stain on this nation's history' Buttigieg closes on Biden, Warren in Iowa: poll MORE.\n\nVan Jones dubbed Buttigieg \u201cPistol Pete\u201d after the last debate, it's looking a lot more like \u201cPoll Tested Pete\u201d to me. Lets see if we can get that one trending.\n\nFurther within the story is more evidence of Buttigieg's shapeshifting. The South Bend Mayor grabbed a lot of headlines in the summer when he was discussing packing the Supreme Court and abolishing the electoral college. So much noise in fact that I even featured a guest on this show who celebrated his plan. The Times says however that Pete's big dollar donors and his financial bundlers told him to stop saying that because it was too radical, and lo and behold its missing now from his stump speech.\n\nThat's all it takes to get Pete Buttigieg to change his mind. Polls and a few calls from his Silicon Valley and Wall Street donors.\n\nThe funny thing is however that Buttigieg's entire gamble is based on ideology and not on how voters actually operate.\n\nThe latest Morning Consult Second Choice data tells us that the second choice for Biden voters is Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersSaagar Enjeti questions Warren's authenticity on 'Medicare for all' All-female panel to moderate November Democratic primary debate Senate rejects Dem measure to overturn IRS rules on SALT deduction cap MORE.

The second choice for Warren voters is? You guessed it Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden.\n\nButtigieg may be doing well in Iowa, but it's a long race to that convention. The truth is that national Democratic primary process really doesn't very have much room for him. That's because that Second Choice data tells us the truth behind what voters actually want, someone they can trust.\n\nWith Biden, you can trust you'll get more of the same you had under Obama. With Bernie, you\u2019ve been saying basically the same thing for 40 years. And with Elizabeth Warren, you can be reasonably certain you'll get some pretty transformative executive changes. With Pete Buttigieg you don't know what the hell you're going to get, except platitudes.", "description": "Opinion by: Saagar EnjetiWell, Pete Buttigieg is reinventing himself again.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/buttigiegpete_10152019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
