MOOCs are offered periodically throughout the year, but more than 3700 of them start this month, according to Open Culture.\n\nThe courses are designed to be accessible from anywhere in the world, so you don't have to worry about time zones or geo blocks. Each course include recorded video lectures, auto-graded and peer-reviewed assignments, and community discussion forums.\n\nIf the idea of taking a free uni course just for the hell of it appeals to you but you\u2019re not sure where to start, I\u2019ve picked several worth checking out:\n\nI could go on and on.
