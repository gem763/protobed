Maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based upon some ethical lapse? Absolutely not,\" he said.\n\n\"It's crazy,\" Biden said of the political hay that has been made of his role with Burisma. as well as his business dealings in China. \"They feel like they have the license to go out and say whatever they want. It feels to me like living in some kind of 'Alice in Wonderland.'\"\n\nBiden said he felt he was qualified to sit on Burisma's board but acknowledged that he would \"probably not\" have been offered the seat were it not for the fact that his father was vice president.\n\nHunter Biden: Hunter Biden will resign from board of Chinese firm, says he won't serve on foreign boards if Joe Biden elected president\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Hunter Biden says he did nothing \"improper\u201d while serving on board of Ukrainian gas company, but may have showed \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in joining.\n\n\n\n\u201cWas it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is...a swamp in\u2014in\u2014in many ways?
