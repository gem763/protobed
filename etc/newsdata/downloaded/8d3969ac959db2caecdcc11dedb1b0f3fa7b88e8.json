To help achieve these Ten Grand Challenges, the federal government should double its funding for energy research and keep the United States number one in the world in advanced computing.\n\nThere is a reason advanced nuclear reactors are at the top of my list of priorities.\n\nNuclear power is our best source of carbon-free power, and we are running a risk of losing it just at a time when most Americans are increasingly worried about climate change. While nuclear power provides about 60 percent of our nation\u2019s carbon-free electricity, solar power provides just 5 percent, and wind power provides just under 18 percent, despite billions of dollars in subsidies.\n\nWith nuclear power available, depending on wind and solar power makes about as much sense as going to war in sailboats. Nuclear power must be part of our energy future if we want clean, cheap and reliable energy that can create good jobs and keep America competitive in a global economy. Simply put, nuclear power is much more reliable than solar or wind power. It is available when the sun doesn\u2019t shine and the wind doesn\u2019t blow.\n\nUnfortunately, we do not need to speculate about what happens when a major industrialized country eliminates nuclear power. Before 2011, Germany obtained one quarter of its electricity from nuclear energy. Today, after mandating that it replace its nuclear power with wind and solar power, that number is down to 12 percent. Now Germany has among the highest household electricity rates in the European Union and has had to build new coal plants to meet their energy demands, increasing their emissions.\n\nThat is where we are headed in the next 10 years if we do not do something. The stakes are high.\n\nThe strategy I propose, however, takes advantage of the United States\u2019 secret weapon: our extraordinary capacity for science and energy research, especially at our 17 national laboratories. Congress has recognized the importance of this research by providing record-level funding for the Office of Science the past four years. Unlike the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d \u2014 which is basically an assault on cars, cows and combustion \u2014 meeting the Ten Grand Challenges will curb carbon emissions, strengthen our economy and raise our family incomes.\n\nThis strategy also recognizes that, when it comes to climate change, China, India and other developing countries are the problem; American innovation is the answer.\n\nAccording to the Global Carbon Project, over the last 13 years, the United States has reduced emissions of greenhouse gases more than any major country. But over the last five years, China\u2019s carbon emissions have risen.\n\nA University of California, Berkeley physicist put it this way: Our mothers told us as children to clean our plates because children in India were starving. Cleaning our plates was a good thing to do, but it didn\u2019t do much for starving Indian children. In the same way, reducing carbon emissions in the United States may be good to do, but it doesn\u2019t do much to address climate change, because most of the increase in greenhouse gases is in developing countries.\n\nIf we want to do something about climate change, we should use American research and technology to provide the rest of the world with the tools to create low-cost energy that emits fewer greenhouse gases.\n\nThe purpose of the original Manhattan project during World War II was to find a way to split the atom and build a bomb before Germany could. The New York Times described this as the \u201cmost concentrated intellectual effort in history.\u201d\n\nInstead of ending a war, the goal of this New Manhattan Project will be to minimize the disruption of our lives and economies caused by climate change \u2014 both in our country and in the rest of the world \u2014 by creating large amounts of clean, inexpensive energy.\n\nThis bold agenda \u2014 which will hopefully have bipartisan support \u2014 can over the next five years place us firmly on a path toward dealing with climate change, and at the same time, produce large amounts of reliable, clean energy that lifts family incomes in our country and around the world.\n\nSen.
