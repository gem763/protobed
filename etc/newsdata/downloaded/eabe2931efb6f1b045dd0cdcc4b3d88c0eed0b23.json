Coming from a region regarded as a near-permanent conflict zone, these stirrings \u2014 reported as isolated protests against inflation or for jobs \u2014 hardly appeared on the radar of a world dealing with a global economic crisis.\n\nTwo years later, the world was forced to take notice as simmering tensions boiled over. The self-immolation of a Tunisian fruit vendor, Mohamed Bouazizi, galvanized the region\u2019s youth, who took to the streets and set in motion a wave of dissent unlike any seen in the region for decades.\n\nTime magazine eventually would recognize the movement with \u201cThe Protestor\u201d as its 2011 \u201cPerson of the Year,\u201d noting that the \u201cprotestors didn\u2019t just voice their complaints; they changed the world.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs U.S. media converged on the squares and streets of Middle Eastern cities to cover what quickly was dubbed the \u201cArab Spring,\u201d the traditional narrative associated with the region \u2014 oil, wars and chaos in Palestine \u2014 was replaced by what young men or women anywhere in the world could relate to: the right to dignity, need for jobs, urge for self-respect and desire for a better life.\n\nToday, we recognize in the voice of young people \u2014 be they the Parkland, Fla., high school students calling for gun control, or Greta Thunberg igniting a global campaign on climate change \u2014 the definitive call for change that cannot be ignored. And it is the same voice of young people that we have documented for 11 years through the ASDA\u2019A BCW Arab Youth Survey.\n\nWe embarked on this initiative because we were surprised by the enormous data vacuum about the largest demographic of one of the world\u2019s most important regions \u2014 one that fuels the world, with 60 percent of the world\u2019s oil reserves and 45 percent of its natural gas reserves. The Middle East also is home to about 400 million people, more than 60 percent of them below age 30. That\u2019s a youth population of 240 million people, more than half the entire U.S. population.\n\nOver the years, our survey has proven to be a remarkably accurate barometer of the prevailing mood of this important demographic. In 2008, when some 23 million millennial voters helped to propel Barack Obama into the White House, our first survey explored how the Arab world\u2019s youth fared against their Western counterparts. The findings underscored what perhaps the world largely believed: that young people in the Arab world looked up to and respected their leaders and viewed religion as an integral part of who they were. But we also learned, perhaps surprisingly, that Arab youth were more optimistic about the future than their Western peers.\n\nA year later, in a foreshadowing of the region\u2019s imminent socio-political turmoil, a majority of young people said their \u201csingle most important priority\u201d was to live in a democratic country. The next year, the message was clearer: Young people had an enduring desire for democracy; there was growing anxiety about the rising cost of living, and less optimism about economic recovery. That year, in 2011, the Arab region witnessed an epochal wave of transformation, led by the very demographic our survey profiled.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Arab Youth Survey, ever since, has held the mirror to \u201cwhat\u2019s next\u201d for the region. As the Arab Spring turned to the Arab Winter, more cynical generations of young Arabs expressed concern \u201cwhether democracy could ever work in the Middle East\u201d (2014); viewed \u201cthe rise of ISIS as the biggest obstacle facing the region\u201d (2015); rejected ISIS and believed the group would fail to establish an Islamic state (2016); wanted their countries to do more for them (2017); and said the previous decade, shaped by the Arab Spring and ISIS, left the region drifting off course (2018).\n\nThe 2019 survey, titled \u201cA Call For Reform,\u201d comes full circle from 2008. This year, Arab youth said religion plays too big a role in the Middle East and that religious institutions need to be reformed. These top findings of our survey are all bold statements that give a more insightful, intuitive understanding of the region for policymakers than endless news cycles about \u201cthe conflict-ridden Middle East.\u201d\n\nSince 2010, the survey has gauged perceptions of Arab youth about the U.S. Until 2016, the U.S. had been regarded as one of the most favored allies of their nations by more than one in three young Arabs, and as the region\u2019s top ally by almost two in three young Arabs in 2016. But that favorable perception has plummeted since President Trump Donald John TrumpZuckerberg launches public defense of Facebook as attacks mount Trump leaning toward keeping a couple hundred troops in eastern Syria: report Warren says making Israel aid conditional on settlement building is 'on the table' MORE entered office; this year, only 41 percent of young Arabs viewed the U.S. as their ally. However, the U.S. still is seen as a top country in which to live and which Arab youth would like their own countries to emulate.\n\nThis suggests that Arab youth take two nuanced views of America \u2014 one defined by foreign policy, the other accepting the U.S. as a success story and a model nation.\n\nWhat do these findings really mean for the U.S.? And why should Americans care?\n\nIt is my view the Americans also should have a nuanced view of the Middle East. I believe the Arab Youth Survey reveals three strategic imperatives that call for knowing the Middle East through the eyes of its largest demographic:\n\nThe economic imperative: While the U.S. has achieved greater energy self-sufficiency, the global economy will continue to depend on the Middle East\u2019s vast oil reserves.\n\nThe security imperative: As our survey reveals, traditional U.S. notions regarding regional terrorism are far removed from reality. Time and again, young Arabs have rejected violence, and policymaking should address this, seeing Arab youth as potential allies in the war on terror, not as enemy combatants.\n\nThe socio-political and cultural imperative: U.S. views about the Middle East, shaped from distant perceptions, are largely irrelevant. Young Arabs \u2014 like young Americans \u2014 prioritize jobs, a good education and better living. They are conscious of climate change, love Hollywood movies alongside the local cultural output of which they are rightly proud, and aspire for a better tomorrow underpinned by opportunities for growth.\n\nIf the U.S. were to look at the Middle East through the eyes of its youth, it could generate a stronger empathy for the region and its people. Rather than the angry mobs we see on cable news, the Arab Youth Survey gives voice to countless millions who deplore violence and have similar hopes, fears and aspirations as young Americans.\n\nThis empathy, I believe, can be the foundation of a new approach to dialogue, one based on mutual respect and shared goals. Ultimately, greater understanding of Arab youth will promote progress and peace, rather than polemics and pessimism.\n\nSunil John is the founder of ASDA\u2019A BCW, a leading Middle Eastern and North African public relations firm based in the United Arab Emirates, which conducts the annual \u201cArab Youth Survey.\u201d He is president of the BCW (Burson Cohn & Wolfe) Middle East communications agency.
