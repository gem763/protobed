Her 2-year-old twins, Rumi and Sir, have several cameos (including their walking and talking debuts), and 7-year-old Blue Ivy Carter gives an impressive rendering of \u201cBrown Skin Girl,\u201d for which she earned her second writing credit.\n\nMaking the Gift follows Homecoming, Bey\u2019s first documentary for Netflix, which covered the lead-up to her historic 2018 Coachella performance. Like this latest project, it gives viewers a candid look at the artist\u2019s life, with Bey sharing frank details about her post-pregnancy body and the challenges of balancing motherhood and work. (Homecoming inexplicably lost to Carpool Karaoke in the variety-special category at the Creative Arts Emmys over the weekend.)\n\nRUMI CARTER IS ADORABLE!

She\u2019s performed while pregnant, shared Instagram photos of her pregnant body, and in last year\u2019s Vogue September issue described the harrowing details of an emergency C-section she underwent. For someone who curates her public image as rigorously as she, the decision to share the (frequently uncomfortable) realities of motherhood is deliberate and profound. As Soraya Nadia McDonald put it in The Undefeated, Bey\u2019s performance of pregnancy is a political act, a way to reclaim \u201ca positive image for black women amid a history of degradation and slander.\u201d\n\nIn any case, intimate documentaries seem to be Bey\u2019s preferred way of giving peasants a glimpse into her life, and a $60 million, three-project deal with Netflix suggests that more could be in our future.", "description": "Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cMaking the Gift\u201d features intimate footage of the twins, highlights Blue Ivy as a superstar-in-the-making.", "authors": ["Sangeeta Singh-Kurtz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/17/16-beyonce-making-the-gift-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
