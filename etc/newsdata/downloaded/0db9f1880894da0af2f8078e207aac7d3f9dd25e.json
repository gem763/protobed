The less time Democrats give themselves to build a case against Trump, the less persuasive that case will be by the time it gets to the Senate, the easier it\u2019ll be for Republicans there to say, \u201cI\u2019m troubled but it\u2019s just not enough to convict.\u201d\n\nPlus, Cocaine Mitch doubtless wants this over as soon as Pelosi does. Nothing good can come from Susan Collins and Cory Gardner having to linger in impeachment limbo while voters in their home states scream at them to vote yes/no.\n\n\u201cVery few hearings, if any,\u201d said a senior Democratic aide, who said the coming investigative work will largely take place in closed-door interviews. The aide spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly\u2026 Under an informal timeline discussed by multiple Democrats on Wednesday, the Intelligence Committee would spend the coming weeks investigating the Ukrainian allegations. Meanwhile, the other five committees investigating Trump-related matters would work to close out their own investigative portfolios. After that, the findings would be passed to the Judiciary Committee, with Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) taking the lead in drafting potential articles of impeachment. Following the two-week recess, the House is scheduled to be in session for the last three weeks of October, then after another one-week recess, another two weeks in session before Thanksgiving. Some Democratic lawmakers and aides said Thursday, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private deliberations, that they believed impeachment articles could be ready for a House vote around Thanksgiving.\n\nCentrist Dems want to go slow in order to show right-leaning voters back home that they\u2019re taking this seriously and not rushing to conclusions about Trump. But that timeline doesn\u2019t work for the party. Pelosi\u2019s worried about this bleeding into next year and disrupting the primaries while Democratic candidates are busy trying to make their case to voters on policy. And with every day that passes, the argument grows stronger that we\u2019re close enough to Election Day to let voters resolve this matter at the polls. Pelosi\u2019s also worried about the public losing interest in the Ukraine matter if it drags on for months. And of course lefties fret that impeachment might backfire on them by driving undecided voters to sympathize with Trump the same way it backfired on the GOP in 1998.\n\nAll of this fits with Pelosi\u2019s baseline view of impeachment \u2014 it\u2019s a bad idea that could actually help Trump next November, but if the base simply won\u2019t be denied its heart\u2019s desire then the House is better off doing it as quickly as it can and dumping it on McConnell. McConnell will doubtless dispense with it quickly too and come next November it\u2019ll be a distant memory. The base gets what it wants and Pelosi still kinda sorta gets to stick with her \u201cfocus on the election\u201d approach. In fact, the most interesting detail in the excerpt is that House committees investigating Trump on matters other than Ukraine \u2014 emoluments, tax returns, hush-money payments, etc \u2014 will now also be pressured to wrap up quickly and send their findings to Nadler. That is, Pelosi\u2019s going to seize this opportunity to snuff as many impeachment candles as she can while she\u2019s busy granting progressives their wish with an impeachment vote on Ukraine. She\u2019s not going to go through this mess again in six months over something else because liberals are mad that the Senate didn\u2019t bounce Trump over Ukraine.\n\nThe standard view of how impeachment might backfire on Democrats is by so infuriating right-leaning voters that Trump\u2019s turnout next fall ends up higher than anyone expected. That\u2019s possible, but there\u2019s a greater risk per Noah Millman \u2014 the process might placate some anti-Trump voters who are outraged by Trump\u2019s behavior and looking to punish him for it. Impeachment might scratch their itch such that they\u2019re less motivated to vote, or it might inadvertently convince them that Trump\u2019s not as corrupt as they\u2019ve been led to believe. It might even move the goalposts on what properly counts as \u201ccorruption\u201d:\n\nThen, while the inquiry is ongoing, there\u2019s a real possibility that the allegations move in the minds of at least some of the public from the political column to the criminal one. The standards of evidence could move from \u201cdo I want to hire this guy again?\u201d to \u201cis he guilty enough to convict?\u201d \u2014 and attacks could feel more like prejudging the case than weighing it and finding the president wanting. This dynamic is arguably ridiculous \u2014 but it\u2019s also exactly what happened in the Kavanaugh hearings. Ironically, starting a process designed to remove the president for his crimes could lead the public to view that process as the sole legitimate venue for adjudicating whether those crimes were committed, and remove them from the electoral calculus. And the GOP is going to pursue all of these lines of argument through official channels and through friendly media, to make sure that the public evolves in the desired fashion.\n\nIt\u2019s pointless to weigh the political pros and cons of impeachment anymore, though, since it\u2019s now assuredly going to happen. Yuval Levin wrote today at NRO about his time as a staffer for Newt Gingrich during the Clinton impeachment saga, when pundits routinely predicted that the GOP would find a reason to hold off and the GOP went right ahead and impeached him anyway. Once you commit to a course this dire and gratifying to your base, Levin explains, there\u2019s no way to retreat without losing face. The momentum is nearly unstoppable. In Trump\u2019s case, it would probably take something on the order of the whistleblower confessing to having made up some of the allegations in his complaint to give Pelosi a strong enough reason to cancel the attack on Trump at the eleventh hour. As it is, Levin\u2019s correct to say that \u201cPelosi now seems to be operating under the logic that the best way to contain the damage from this process to her conference is to get it over with quickly.\u201d She\u2019s going to check the box, then McConnell\u2019s going to check it, and that\u2019ll be that.
