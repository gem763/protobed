They claim that many of those who contributed may have broken NHS confidentiality rules (stock image)\n\nThey said the Tavistock feared the book may contain comments 'defamatory' of its staff.\n\nIt warned that if the editors refused to send the book to the clinic prior to publication, the Trust reserved its 'full legal rights' to take court action.\n\nAn earlier letter from the clinic's lawyers at the firm DAC Beachcroft insisted the service was not trying to 'gag' the writers and staff who had been interviewed, but wanted to ensure the book contributes to the transgender 'debate' in 'a fair, accurate and positive manner'.\n\nProfessor Frank Furedi, who has spoken out against transgender activists 'shutting down' debate, said the legal letters appeared to be an attempt to 'silence' medical staff raising 'valid concerns'.\n\nOne of the book's co-editors, Dr Heather Brunskell-Evans, said the concerns raised by the clinic were unfounded because there had been no breaches of confidentiality.\n\nOn the decision not to send the book to the Trust before publication last month, she said: 'The Tavistock are an NHS organisation, using public funds to try to influence the manner in which [co-editor] Michele Moore, myself and the other writers contributed to the debate.'\n\nThe book includes interviews with whistleblowers from the Gender Identity Development Service warning that doctors are failing to tell young people they are 'sacrificing' their chance to have children (stock image)\n\nThe Mail on Sunday exclusively previewed the book in July, highlighting how it challenges what it claims are transgender 'myths' told to children.\n\nThe book includes interviews with whistleblowers from GIDS, the only NHS gender clinic for under-18s, warning that doctors are failing to tell young people they are 'sacrificing' their chance to have children by taking powerful sex-change drugs.\n\nIt also warns that psychologists will not question if a child is transgender or not for fear of accusations of transphobia, and claims clinicians are failing to acknowledge other reasons for youngsters wanting to change sex, such as autism.\n\nA spokesman for GIDS said: 'The Trust welcomes thoughtful, informed discussion. But we consider any correspondence between the Trust and third parties on these matters to be confidential.'", "description": "The editors of Inventing Transgender Children and Young People were contacted by lawyers who claimed many people who  contributed to the book may have broken confidentiality rules.", "authors": ["Sanchez Manning Social Affairs Correspondent For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/23/19638128-0-image-a-159_1570918911422.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
