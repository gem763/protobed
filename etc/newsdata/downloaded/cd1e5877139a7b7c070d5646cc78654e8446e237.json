It won't be until Parliament passes the Identity-matching Services Bill of 2019, which was just rejected by the bipartisan joint intelligence and security committee due to its lack of privacy safeguards. The committee recommended the bill be entirely redrafted.\n\nThe Document Verification Service, which allows businesses and government agencies to verify an individual's identity documents with the relevant issuers, is operational.\n\nThe Australian government is investigating whether current age verification is sufficient\n\nFlickr\n\nAnnounced last month, the Australian House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs' inquiry intends to determine whether current age verification systems on porn and gambling sites are sufficient. In the press release announcing the inquiry last month, the committee's chair Andrew Wallace specifically expressed concern there is a discrepancy between the requirements for porn as compared to gambling.\n\n\"While customers must verify their age within 14 days to continue using an online wagering account, an age verification process is not required at all for customers to access online pornography,\" Wallace said.\n\n\"This is concerning, as research shows that accessing pornography negatively influences young peoples' attitudes to sex, sexuality and relationships.\"\n\nThe committee stressed in its press release it does not intend to target the \"legitimate\" use of online porn and gambling.\n\nThe committee asserts 44 percent of children between the ages of nine and 16 have reported encountering sexual images online.\n\nThe national facial recognition system has been extremely controversial\n\nWith the ominous nickname '\"The Capability,\" the national facial recognition database has previously faced scrutiny.\n\nThe National Facial Biometrics Matching Capability is intended to utilize photographic documents like passports and drivers licenses to create a national biometric database. This data could then be matched with pictures captured on CCTV to rapidly identify criminals and identity thieves. Australian citizens cannot opt-out of this system, unlike other contentious government data collection programs.\n\nLast month, it was announced the driver's licence photos of every Victorian resident had been uploaded to the database, on the proviso that access would be limited to select, state-based government agencies. The Victorian government had previously flagged its opposition to \"The Capability\" in its current form.\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs' submission on age verification suggests it is willing to extend the purview of \"The Capability\" beyond a narrow definition of identity fraud.\n\nThe UK tried enhanced age verification for online porn \u2013 and ditched it earlier this month\n\niStock/SolisImages\n\nOne of the reference points for the parliamentary inquiry into age verification is the UK's proposed porn block system, which would have forced operators of porn sites to implement systems verifying their users are over 18, or face being entirely blocked in the country.\n\nThe proposed legislation left it open to site operators as to how the verification would actually be implemented, with facial biometrics being touted as one possible outcome. Another widely derided proposal suggested the introduction of \"porn passes\" \u2013 physical vouchers which could be purchased from shops after showing ID.\n\nBut the ban was scrapped earlier in October \u2013 after the Australian inquiry was announced, which explicitly referenced the UK experiment.", "description": "The government facial recognition software, nicknamed \"The Capability,\" would verify internet users' ages before they can access porn or gambling sites.", "authors": ["James Hennessy", "Business Insider Australia"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db799e2dee01905ec4ea632?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
