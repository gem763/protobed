spooking several of the company\u2018s backers along the way.\n\nFour months on, and after losing many of its original supporters, Facebook finally managed to get 21, out of the original 28, organizations to sign the Libra Association charter.\n\nHard Fork has put together a quick overview of every organization that\u2019s still involved and those who have (understandably!) ran a mile, because, let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s hard to keep track.\n\nWho\u2019s out?\n\nRumors about uneasiness among Facebook\u2018s Libra supporters have mounted for some time, but confirmation about a series of high-profile departures finally arrived over the past few weeks.\n\nPayPal\n\nPayPal\u2019s announcement as one of Libra\u2018s initial backers failed to raise many eyebrows, given that that David Marcus, Libra\u2018s managing director and COO, used to be president at the online payment system.\n\nHowever, the multinational company became the first company to leave Libra when it announced its withdrawal earlier this month.\n\nPayPal didn\u2019t specify why it had decided to part ways, but said in a statement that it taken \u201d the decision to forgo further participation in the Libra association at this time and to continue to focus on advancing our existing mission and business priorities as we strive to democratize access to financial services for underserved populations.\u201d\n\nMastercard, Visa, eBay, Stripe, and Mercado Pago\n\nFollowing increasing political pressure and just days before the project\u2018s supporters were due to meet in Geneva, to sign the charter, Mastercard, Visa, eBay, Stripe, and Mercado Pago pulled out.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to evaluate and our ultimate decision will be determined by a number of factors, including the Association\u2019s ability to fully satisfy all requisite regulatory expectations,\u201d a Visa company spokesperson said last Friday.\n\n\u201cVisa\u2019s continued interest in Libra stems from our belief that well-regulated blockchain-based networks could extend the value of secure digital payments to a greater number of people and places, particularly in emerging and developing markets,\u201d they added.\n\nAn eBay spokesperson told the Financial Times (FT) that it had made the decision in order to \u201c[focus] on rolling out eBay\u2019s managed payments experience for our customers\u201d.\n\nFinTech giant Stripe said that in spite of its exit it still believed Libra had \u201cpotential\u201d to \u201cmake online commerce more accessible for people around the world\u201d and remained open to working with the project \u201cat a later stage\u201d.\n\nTwo people familiar with the decisions tod the FT Mastercard and Mercado Pago had also quit.\n\nBooking Holdings\n\nOnline travel company Booking Holdings Inc., which runs websites including Kayak.com and Priceline.com, has also left the \u2018cryptocurrency\u2019 project spearheaded by Facebook.\n\nWho\u2019s still in it to win it?\n\nTable featuring the Libra Association\u2019s members, correct as of October, 15, 2019.\n\nThe blockchain band\n\nThe blockchain and cryptocurrency industry is being represented by Anchorage, a firm seeking to advance institutional participation in the digital asset class; Bison Trails, a blockchain infrastructure provider; cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and bitcoin wallet and storage provider Xapo.\n\nFacebook\u2019s foothold\n\nUnsurprisingly, Facebook\u2018s subsidiary Calibra, which will oversee the giant\u2019s cryptocurrency plans \u2013 including the creation of a blockchain-based digital wallet \u2013 is staying put despite recently being sued by another mobile banking app for using a very similar logo.\n\nThe venture capitalists\n\nAlthough Facebook\u2018s Libra is not out of the woods yet, it can (at least for now!) count on the support of heavyweights from the venture capital world.\n\nAndreessen Horowitz, an investor in Facebook; Ribbit Capital, which has backed Coinbase and Xapo; and Union Square Ventures, an investor in Coinbase and Stripe, are all supporting the project.\n\nThrive Capital, which backs media and technology companies; and Breakthrough Initiatives, are also remaining loyal.\n\nThe multinational telecoms experts\n\nVodafone, which recently repledged its support for the project so long as it operated independently of Facebook, is still involved.\n\nIliad, a French provider of telecommunication services, also remains a partner.\n\nThe non-profits and academics\n\nCreative Destruction Lab, one of the original backers, is a not-for-profit startup program that combines computer science and economic design. It supports startups building new infrastructure and applications using blockchain technologies via a dedicated Blockchain stream and has also signed the charter.\n\nFellow founding member Kiva, which crowdfunds loans for the underserved and seeks to improve financial barriers across the world, is also sticking around. So is Mercy Corps, a humanitarian organization helping people to recover from a crisis.\n\nWomen\u2019s World Banking, focused on low-income women and helping them gain access to financial markets, is also remaining involved.\n\nThe luxury fashionistas\n\nAnother founding member is Farfetch Limited, a well-known luxury fashion platform set up in the United Kingdom.\n\nWhen it announced its support, the company said that it had long been interested in blockchain, noting how it had been researching potential applications of the technology.\n\nThe music streaming giant\n\nSpotify, which also pledged its support when the project was first announced, is in.\n\n\u201cLibra offers a massive opportunity for simple, convenient, and safe payment over the internet (particularly for the 1.7 billion adults worldwide without access to mobile money, a bank account, or a payment card,\u201d it said in its original statement.\n\nThe transport disrupters\n\nUber and Lyft, both founding members, will be sticking around to help with the launch of Libra.\n\nThe solo payments star\n\nPayU was joined by Mastercard, Paypal, Stripe, and Visa in this category, but is now flying solo.\n\nThe Dutch online payment service provider (also Naspers\u2019 fintech arm!) is also a founding partner and will be staying put.\n\nWhere we are now\n\nCompliance issues, which have hit payment firms particularly hard, still remain and even though Facebook may perceive the signing of the membership charter to be a roaring success, Libra\u2018s true tests still lay ahead.\n\nAt least Facebook has finally formalized a group seemingly working towards the same objective, though.\n\nWant more Hard Fork?
