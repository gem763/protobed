But that is starting to change.\n\nElon Musk has promised to unveil an all-electric pickup truck later this year. With his characteristic flair for product hype, the entrepreneur has already let drop a few details, including a surprisingly low starting price below $50,000, a range of at least 400-500 miles for some\u2014presumably more expensive\u2014options, and plugs for power tools so that users don\u2019t need a generator.\n\nAnnouncing a vehicle and making one are quite different things. Tesla TSLA -1.92% has already announced three models that it hasn\u2019t started to build commercially yet\u2014the Model Y crossover, Roadster sports car and a semitrailer truck\u2014and its problems with the Model 3 production ramp up have been well documented.\n\nEven so, a Tesla truck is news Detroit can\u2019t afford to ignore. Pickups matter far more for its profit base than sedans and other categories Tesla wants to push into.\n\nPickup trucks accounted for 33% of U.S. sales at GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler in the second quarter, according to Wards Intelligence, up from 30% for the same period last year. They probably generate a much bigger share of profits. New \u201cfull-size\u201d trucks such as Ford\u2019s F-150, GM\u2019s Silverado or Fiat Chrysler\u2019s RAM face little competition from German or Japanese brands, and now come with an average price point of $47,255, according to Edmunds. Moreover, none of the Detroit manufacturers made any profit outside North America in the second quarter.\n\n\u201cTrucks are the one sure bet for all three. They\u2019re trying to take every cent off the table and use it to fund their research and development,\u201d says Tyson Jominy, an analyst at research firm J.D. Power.\n\nGM and Ford both have projects to make all-electric trucks that would compete head-on with any Tesla might offer. Neither has given a launch date, but like Mr. Musk they are ramping up the hype. In June, Ford released a video showing an all-electric F-150 towing well in excess of one million pounds in front of some initially-skeptical customers. Only Fiat Chrysler seems to be operating a wait-and-see strategy, in keeping with its cautious approach to electrification in Europe\u2019s small-car market.\n\nThe incumbent pickup manufacturers have every interest in delaying the electric rollout as long as possible. Trucks are heavy and require substantial battery power to move. Lithium-ion batteries are good at delivering power\u2014hence Ford\u2019s PR stunt\u2014but the more power that is used to tow a big load, the less is available to stay on the road. The most obvious solution is to give electric trucks big batteries, but that will make them disproportionately heavy and expensive.\n\nThe longer Detroit waits, the further battery costs should fall\u2014and the longer it can make fat profits on engine vehicles it mastered long ago. But nor can the incumbents afford to fall behind Tesla in a core product category. Ted Cannis, global director of electrification at Ford, stresses the company\u2019s \u201cdesire to maintain leadership\u201d with the F-150 franchise.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just Tesla. Rivian and Bollinger Motors, two Michigan-based startups, are trying to take on GM, Ford and Fiat Chrylser on their own turf.\n\nRivian revealed a pickup prototype last November with a starting price of $69,000 that will deliver a single-charge range of at least 230 miles. The company has since received funding from both Amazon and Ford, and expects to start deliveries late next year. Bollinger, which is making a sport-utility vehicle as well as a pickup truck, hopes to start production in the second half of 2020, and is targeting a range of at least 200 miles. It will give further details, such as price, when it unveils prototypes next month.\n\nRivian is targeting its product squarely at the leisure market\u2014the kind of consumers who might buy a pickup for weekend trips away rather than huge loads\u2014and the Bollinger also seems likely to be a specialist product. If Tesla takes a similar approach, Detroit can relax a bit, but Mr. Musk doesn\u2019t have a record of settling for niche.\n\nHowever technologically fanciful it turns out to be, Tesla\u2019s truck project will likely keep pressure on the Detroit Three to invest billions of dollars in electrifying their pickups. This is a fight that will only get more expensive for investors in the years ahead.\n\nWrite to Stephen Wilmot at stephen.wilmot@wsj.com", "description": "So far, Tesla\u2019s efforts to disrupt the auto industry have caused more trouble in the luxury-sedan hub of Germany than in Detroit.
