In this latest round of obviously disproven lies about antifa, conservative parents are scared that the movement\u2019s activists will report them to Child Protective Services to take their children away.\n\nConservative activist Patrick Howley\u2014the Big League Politics founder who\u2019s now at the pro-Trump Epoch Times\u2014kicked things off earlier this month by citing a graphic from ostensible antifa account \u201c@JoinAntifa\u201d that promised to report Trump supporters with children to social services.\n\n\u201cLots of sources say this is happening\u2014don\u2019t let them say this was a joke,\u201d Howley tweeted.\n\nFrom there, the idea that antifa activists are trying to steal away Trump supporters\u2019 kids earned articles across right-wing blogs in addition to being picked up by Twitter personalities like Jack Posobiec .\n\n\u201cThis is sick,\u201d declared adult film star Jenna Jameson .\n\nDespite its popularity on the right, this idea is totally fake. The entire claim is based on the single @JoinAntifa tweet. @JoinAntifa has just 36 followers, and is obviously set up to either troll Trump supporters or help create damaging fake news stories about antifa.\n\n@JoinAntifa\u2019s page features other slick, if obviously ridiculous, graphics\u2014including supposed antifa schemes to report pro-Trump Boy Scout troop leaders as pedophiles and promising to send armed antifa members to polling sites.\n\nAs of Wednesday, Twitter had limited the account\u2019s visibility on the site, apparently to stop it from spreading disinformation.\n\nFake MAGA hat story riles up Love Connection host\n\nConservative pundit and former game show host Chuck Woolery got his more than 600,000 Twitter followers fuming Monday with a tweet claiming that budget airline Frontier Airlines was booting innocent Trump supporters off their planes for wearing MAGA hats.\n\nWoolery\u2019s tweet inspired a wave of angry tweets at Frontier\u2019s Twitter account, articles across the right-wing blogosphere, promises to boycott the airline, and vows to wear even more MAGA hats onto Frontier flights. As it turns out, the story Woolery is promoting is filled with inaccuracies.\n\nIn Woolery\u2019s telling, a young man had been booted from a Frontier plane solely for wearing the red hat.\n\n\u201cSo a kid wearing a MAGA hat gets on a Frontier Flight,\u201d Woolery wrote. \u201cHe is verbally attacked by to (sic) passengers. Instead of them being thrown off the flight, Frontier decides he\u2019s the bad guy? Thank you for not flying Frontier Air Lines.\u201d\n\nThe first thing Woolery\u2019s tweet misses is that the alleged incident happened in January and already made the rounds on the conservative blogosphere once. Back then, a minor MAGA personality calling himself Kenny Cool complained in a video that he had been kicked off a Frontier plane.\n\nIn his video, Cool said he entered the plane and announced \u201cMAGA, Trump 2020, Roger Stone is an innocent man.\u201d Then Cool notes that this was the second time he\u2019d been kicked off a plane over the hat\u2014another sign that Cool\u2019s hat might not actually be the problem here.\n\nIn January, Frontier told me in an email that Cool had been booted from the flight for not for his hat, but for \u201cexhibiting threatening behavior.\u201d\n\n\u201cA customer was agitating fellow passengers and being argumentative and disruptive to the point that our flight crew, and even other passengers, asked him to stop,\u201d a Frontier spokesperson told me in a statement. \u201cFrontier does not tolerate behavior that could jeopardize safety of flight. The passenger was deplaned because he was exhibiting threatening behavior and would not follow crewmember instructions to stop.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s new house looms large in right-wing imagination\n\nRight-wing media outlets have seized on Barack and Michelle Obama buying a $15 million waterfront mansion in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, seeing it as proof that global warming isn\u2019t real.\n\nNormally, two wealthy people whose new Netflix production deal alone is reportedly worth several multiples of $15 million wouldn\u2019t be big news. But this fast-spreading talking point, laid out on Fox News and other conservative outlets, holds that if global warming was real, Obama wouldn\u2019t buy a house near the water.\n\nUnder this thinking, as a former president, Obama is presumably privy to any information about global warming being a hoax. Therefore, Obama is only buying a waterfront house because global warming is fake.\n\n\u201cIf comfortable members of the progressive gentry set don\u2019t take global warming seriously, why should anyone else?\u201d asked an editorial in the Las Vegas Review Journal , which is owned by Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson .\n\nPundit and Trump pardon recipient Dinesh D\u2019Souza pushed this line in an appearance on Fox News.\n\n\u201cIt shows that Obama himself knows it\u2019s nonsense because if he believed a word of it, if he thought the oceans were going to rise and his property was going to go underwater, he would not have made the investment,\u201d D\u2019Souza said.\n\nThe idea that Obama\u2019s new mansion disproves global warming has spread so far that pro-Trump vlogging duo Diamond and Silk refered to it in passing at Trump\u2019s rally Monday in Fayetteville, North Carolina. \u201cDiamond\u201d\u2014real name Lynnette Hardaway\u2014told the audience that Obama was hypocritical for \u201cpreaching about climate change and the mansion is right there off the ocean.\u201d The crowd loved it.", "description": "See what\u2019s happening with the extreme Right Wing.", "authors": ["Will Sommer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568235779/190911-right-richter-hero_goog9m", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
