I went with the Dark Tan Grab N Go Tote over the Small Tin Cloth Duffle mainly for versatility since I mostly carry totes to work and when going out for errands. I agree with Kyle (below) that it is pretty large - too big for every day use, for sure - but it works great as a carry on or overnight bag and can be used as a day bag if you have a lot to carry or, like me, like to be prepared for the apocalypse at all times. As for the quality, it's as good as it gets; everything you'd expect from a Filson product.\n\n\n\nThe only note I have is that the product photos of the Dark Tan/Brown aren't accurate. Filson has updated the Grab N Go and Field Bags to have dark brown handles/straps instead of tan handles like the older version pictured. Still a handsome bag!", "description": "Buy the Filson Large Grab 'N' Go Tote online or shop all  from Backcountry.com.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://content.backcountry.com/images/items/large/FSN/FSN008G/DARTAN.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-05"}
