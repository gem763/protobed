Some want to do what the government promised and get Brexit agreed to first, even if it means compromise. The voters, they argue, will reward the Conservative Party even if they think the deal imperfect.\n\nMr. Johnson has chosen, instead, to respond with deadlines and threats.\n\nOn the one hand, it\u2019s important to recognize this demand for an election as the piece of political theater that it is. It\u2019s intended both to reinforce the myth Mr. Johnson\u2019s been building \u2014 that he\u2019s the person willing and able to deliver Brexit, and the only reason he can\u2019t deliver it is the obstinacy of Parliament or the Europeans standing in his way \u2014 and to distract from his own failures.\n\nThe two core pledges of his leadership \u2014 that he\u2019d get Britain out of Europe by the end of October, and that he would never request an extension \u2014 have been shamelessly reversed this week. The reason his deal is in trouble in Parliament is not general recalcitrance, but the fact that the minute the members have the time to examine it, the fragile coalition that might vote for it dissolves, as both the right wing, the moderates and the opposition rebels will find elements of it they cannot support.\n\nSo, yes, the demand for an election is a diversion.\n\nOn the other hand, to see it only as theater is to miss something crucial: The fight over whether to hold an election before or after Brexit is about more than what gives Mr. Johnson the better chance of winning. It is, as a senior Tory said grimly to me, a battle for the soul of the Conservative Party, and over the nature of British politics.\n\nAn election fought after a Brexit had been agreed to would be on orthodox territory; parties would offer competing visions of a better Britain.", "description": "The soul of Britain\u2019s Conservative Party \u2014 and the country itself \u2014 is at stake.", "authors": ["Jenni Russell"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/28/opinion/27Russell/27Russell-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
