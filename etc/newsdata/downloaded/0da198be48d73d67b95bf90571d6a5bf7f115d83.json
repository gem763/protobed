USA TODAY\n\nThe dead sometimes speak louder than the living.\n\nThat's especially true when it comes to investing, markets and the economy, topics that generate many opinions from living people, few of which are useful.\n\nI find it's better to ask the deceased what they think. With that in mind, I\u2019ve profiled seven departed legends whose views should always remain at the top of your mind when you want advice about investing. The more you study these people, the better you'll fare.\n\nNeff: Bragging means selling\n\nJohn Neff, the last of the legendary mutual fund managers, died June 4. His 31 years running the Windsor Fund, part of Vanguard, averaged 13.7% annually to 1995, more than doubling a comparable S&P 500 investment. How did he do it? Neff avoided fads and focused on fundamental firms and value, seeking to buy stocks cheaply compared with their intrinsic worth. That is a timely reminder since value investing is now long out of fashion. It will return someday.\n\nNeff said things like, \u201cWhen you feel like bragging about a stock, it\u2019s probably time to sell.\u201d\n\nJohn Bogle in his Malvern, Pa. office on April 12, 2007.

Buffett is often depicted as 85% Ben Graham (the other 15% being Phil Fisher, see below). Graham is often called, \u201cthe father of value investing.\u201d If you have time for just one investing book, make sure it's Graham\u2019s classic, \"The Intelligent Investor.\" Graham\u2019s key takeaway? Heeding value provides a margin of safety and higher returns, although those returns are irregular over time. That's because most investors oversell and underappreciate what isn\u2019t faddish and hasn\u2019t worked recently.\n\nT. Rowe Price & Phil Fisher: Growth gurus\n\nThe reverse thinking came from the two \u201cfathers\u201d of growth stock investing, Thomas Rowe Price Jr. and Philip Fisher (disclosure: my father). These two are considered the first major voices claiming that a firm\u2019s future growth prospects matter much more than the current perceived \u201cvalue.\u201d Both deployed rigorous, varied disciplines for verifying small firms that would grow fast longer term. Price is best known for founding mutual fund giant T. Rowe Price Group. Fisher\u2019s legendary book, \"Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits,\" was the first investing book to ever grace The New York Times best-seller list. Price and Fisher, if active now, would both be riding high in this growth-oriented bull market.\n\nBogle: Passive champion\n\nVanguard\u2019s Jack Bogle taught the world that most people will do better if they focus on neither growth nor value but instead become passive investors through an S&P 500 Index Fund. Beating the market requires that you know something useful others don\u2019t. Do you?\n\nIf not, Bogle provided a ready path: Combine growth and value passively and match the market without trying to beat it or accidentally lag it. He knew most investors lag the market by in-and-outing the wrong things at all the wrong times. Since most money managers have lagged markets for years, Bogle would also ride high right now.\n\nLoeb: Be a skeptic\n\nGerald Loeb was an early \u201ccontrarian investing\u201d voice, believing that if too many investors thought something would happen, it was already priced into the market and wouldn\u2019t happen. He was an active trader, book author, columnist and sometimes called \u201cthe most quoted man on Wall Street.\u201d Some of Loeb is usually in my writings.\n\nHe also established the gold standard of awards for excellence in financial journalism, the Gerald Loeb Award. Loeb\u2019s key takeaway? Always invest, but be skeptically skittish because nothing endures.\n\nPonzi: Sounds too good to be true\n\nCharles Ponzi\u2019s legend lives on, quite infamously: the Ponzi scheme is his namesake. Studying his schemes teaches to avoid being a victim of them. When a deal sounds too good to be true, it isn\u2019t true. Risk is real and everywhere. So are fraudsters.\n\nKen Fisher is founder and executive chairman of Fisher Investments, author of 11 books, four of which were New York Times bestsellers, and is No. 200 on the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans.
