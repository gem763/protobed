During a hearing held on Tuesday before the European Parliament in Brussels, Valdis Dombrovskis told EU lawmakers:\n\nEurope needs a common approach on crypto-assets such as Libra. I intend to propose new legislation on this.\n\nDombrovski has been acting as the bloc\u2019s finance commissioner for the last five years and is currently seeking support for a reappointment. According to him, regulation of virtual currencies should be addressed ASAP since it promotes unfair competition, cybersecurity issues and could represent a real threat to financial stability.\n\nSince Facebook announced its plans to develop a stablecoin pledged to a basket of currencies, governments and regulators around the world reacted negatively. In Europe, the French Minister, Bruno Le Maire, and the German member of the European Parliament, Marklus Ferber, immediately called for tighter regulations against the social media giant.\n\nAccording to Mr. Le Maire, Libra shouldn\u2019t be seen as a replacement for traditional currencies claiming:\n\nIt is out of question\u2026 It can\u2019t and it must not happen.\n\nAdditionally, Le Maire called on the Group of Seven central bank governors, guardians of the global monetary system, to begin studying Facebook\u2019s Libra project; especially to study concerns regarding privacy, money laundering and terrorism finance.\n\nFacebook has been facing backlash ever since its announcement of the Libra coin, and is now even losing members of the Libra Association, with PayPal recently announcing its decision to abandon the association.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cryptocoin.News Is The Central News Source For Information On Cryptocurrencies.
