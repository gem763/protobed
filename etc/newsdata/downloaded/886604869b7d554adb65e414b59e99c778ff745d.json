(AP) \u2014 Beau English threw a touchdown pass and ran for a score and Richmond sacked Albany quarterback Jeff Underfuffler seven times as the Spiders held off the Great Danes 23-20 on Saturday.\n\nRichmond (2-3, 1-1 Colonial Athletic Association) did all of its scoring in the first half.\n\nJake Larson, Richmond's first true freshman kicker since 2006, booted a career-best 50-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead. Underfuffler put the Great Danes (3-3, 1-1) up 7-3, directing a 12-play, 77-yard drive that took 5:29 off the clock and culminating with his 6-yard TD toss to Murad Hussain. Aaron Dykes returned the ensuing kickoff 35 yards to the Richmond 39 and on the first play from scrimmage English hooked up with Keyston Fuller for a 61-yard TD and a 10-7 Spiders' lead.\n\nAlbany went 77 yards in five plays on its next possession with Alex James running it in from the 4-yard line, but Dylan Burns missed the point-after kick and the Great Danes led 13-10. Richmond grabbed a 16-13 second-quarter lead on 48- and 26-yard field goals by Larson on back-to-back possessions.\n\nThe Spiders scored for the final time when Maurice Jackson, who had three sacks on the day, picked off an Underfuffler pass and returned it to the Albany 6-yard line. Two plays later English scored on a 1-yard run for a 23-13 halftime lead.\n\nIt was a scoreless second half until Underfuffler connected with Jerah Reeves for a 20-yard TD to pull the Great Danes within three points with 2:47 left in the game. Albany had a chance to get the ball back but an offsides penalty on a Richmond punt let the Spiders run out the clock.\n\nRichmond is now 7-0 all-time versus Albany. The Spiders won the previous two games on last-second field goals. Richmond managed just 183 yards of offense. Albany had 302 yards but just 14 yards on 29 carries on the ground.\n\nUnderfuffler completed 15 of 31 passes for 288 yards with three TDs and two picks.\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
