GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares drop to 3-week low, U.S. politics adds to gloom\n\n* Trump Whistleblower report seen raising U.S. uncertainties\n\n* U.S.-China trade talks expected in early October\n\n* Chip-related shares take a hit after Micron's bleak\n\noutlook\n\n* Asian stock markets: https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4\n\nBy Hideyuki Sano\n\nTOKYO, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Asian shares slipped to\n\nthree-week lows on Friday as the release of a whistleblower\n\ncomplaint against U.S. President Donald Trump added to\n\nuncertainties about the global economy, already reeling from the\n\nChina-U.S. trade war.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan\n\nslipped 0.42%, having fallen 1.72% so far this\n\nweek, while Japan's Nikkei slid 1.27%.\n\nU.S. S&P 500 futures fell 0.2% in Asian trading after\n\nthe index dropped 0.24% on Thursday.\n\nA whistleblower report released on Thursday said President\n\nDonald Trump not only abused his office in attempting to solicit\n\nUkraine's interference in the 2020 U.S. election for his\n\npolitical benefit, but that the White House tried to \"lock down\"\n\nevidence about that conduct.\n\nThe report came after the Speaker of the U.S. House of\n\nRepresentatives Nancy Pelosi launched an impeachment inquiry\n\ninto him this week.\n\n\"The start of the impeachment inquiry adds a new element of\n\nuncertainties to markets, in addition to ongoing concerns about\n\nthe U.S.-China trade war and the risk of a U.S. recession,\" said\n\nNorihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ\n\nMorgan Stanley Securities.\n\n\"While no one thinks the Senate will vote for his\n\nimpeachment given the Republican majority there, we could see\n\nmore new revelations during a long investigation process,\" he\n\nadded.\n\nOn trade issues, news headlines were too mixed for investors\n\nto show a clear reaction.\n\nCNBC reported that trade war talks were scheduled for Oct.\n\n10-11 in Washington, citing people familiar with the\n\narrangements, and China's top diplomat said China was willing to\n\nbuy more U.S. products. But other media reports on Thursday that the United States\n\nis unlikely to allow American firms to supply China's Huawei\n\nTechnologies HWT.UL undermined hopes of a complete deal\n\nbetween the countries. The damage is already evident as Micron Technology Inc\n\n, a major Huawei supplier, forecast first-quarter profit\n\nbelow Wall Street targets, pushing its share prices down 7% in\n\nafter-hours trade. That in turn hit chip-related shares in Asia such as Samsung\n\nElectronics , SK Hynix and Tokyo Electron\n\n.\n\nIn the currency market, the euro hovered near a 2-1/2-year\n\nlow amid concerns about sluggish growth in the currency bloc,\n\nwith rising fear of recession in its biggest economy, Germany.\n\nThe euro stood at $1.0918 after earlier falling to\n\n$1.0909, the lowest since May 12, 2017.\n\nThe gloomy outlook in Europe was in contrast to the United\n\nStates, where despite some pockets of weakness -- such as\n\nmanufacturing and consumer sentiment -- growth remained\n\nrelatively robust, with the jobless rate at the lowest in nearly\n\n50 years.\n\nSome market participants suspect the dollar was also helped\n\nby continued tightness in dollar funding after U.S. short-term\n\nborrowing costs shot up last week.\n\nThe dollar traded at 107.73 yen , after climbing to\n\n107.96 on Thursday.\n\nSterling traded at $1.2330 GBP=D4 , near two-week low of\n\n$1.2303 hit on Thursday, as investors waited for the British\n\nparliament's next attempt to break the Brexit impasse.\n\nThe Mexican peso weakened to a 2-1/2-week low of 19.680 to\n\nthe dollar after Mexico's central bank cut its key\n\ninterest rate on Thursday, with more cuts seen on the horizon.\n\nOil prices fell on Friday as signs of the rapid return of\n\noutput from Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest exporter, after a\n\nSept. 14 attack on its production facilities reduced concerns\n\nabout potential supply disruptions.\n\nBrent crude futures fell 0.83% to $62.22 a barrel\n\nbut stayed above Wednesday's low of $61.23, while U.S. West\n\nTexas Intermediate (WTI) crude lost 0.44% to $56.16 per\n\nbarrel, off their low of $55.41 on Thursday.", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares drop to 3-week low, U.S. politics adds to gloom", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC0E0NI_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
