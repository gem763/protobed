I walk when I want and I stop when I want.\u201d\n\nCervical spinal cord injury leaves around 20 percent of patients paralysed in all four limbs and is the most severe injury of its kind.\n\n\u201cThe brain is still capable of generating commands that would normally move the arms and legs, there\u2019s just nothing to carry them out,\u201d said Alim-Louis Benabid, professor emeritus at Grenoble and lead author of the study published Friday in The Lancet Neurology.\n\nA team of experts from the Hospital of Grenoble Alpes, biomedical firm Cinatech and the CEA research centre started by implanting two recording devices either side of Thibault\u2019s head, between the brain and the skin.\n\nThese read his sensorimotor cortex \u2014 the area that controls motor function.\n\nEach decoder transmits the brain signals which are then translated by an algorithm into the movements the patient has thought about. It is this system that sends physical commands that the exoskeleton executes.\n\nThibault used the avatar and video game to think about performing basic physical tasks such as walking, and reaching out to touch objects.\n\nUsing the avatar, video game and exoskeleton combined, he was able to cover the length of one and a half football pitches over the course of many sessions.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Repaired not augmented man\u2019 \u2013\n\nSeveral previous studies have used implants to stimulate muscles in patients\u2019 own bodies, but the Grenoble study is the first to use brain signals to control a robot exoskeleton.\n\nExperts involved in the research say it could potentially lead to brain-controlled wheelchairs for paralysed patients.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about turning man into machine but about responding to a medical problem,\u201d said Benabid.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about \u2018repaired man\u2019, not \u2018augmented man\u2019.\n\nIn a comment piece on the study, Tom Shakespeare from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said the exoskeleton system was \u201ca long way from usable clinical possibility\u201d.\n\nBut Thibault said the trial offered a \u201cmessage of hope to people like me\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is possible, even with our handicap.\u201d", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 A French man paralysed in a night club accident can walk again thanks to a brain-controlled exoskeleton in what scientists say is a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
