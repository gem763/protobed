Bolt admitted he would consider playing in the NFL, but only for two teams.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nWhich two teams is the 33-year-old Bolt willing to join? The New England Patriots or the Green Bay Packers, according to TMZ.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBolt told TMZ, \u201cIf the Patriots or Aaron Rodgers call me. If they call me, I'm ready!\"\n\nMaybe that shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. Most NFL prospects would love to play with Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers. That would be the ideal situation for a receiver.\n\nCould Bolt actually make that transition? There\u2019s no doubt he has the speed and size to be a dangerous threat. Bolt is 6-foot-5 and runs a 4.2 40-yard dash. He\u2019s Brandon Marshall if Brandon Marshall was the fastest person in the world.\n\nStill, it takes more than size and speed to be a force in the NFL. You have to actually have the skills to make catches and run routes.\n\nNFL teams have taken bigger gambles in the past, so it\u2019s possible Bolt actually gets a shot at proving himself in the NFL. Given Bolt\u2019s rawness, that\u2019s unlikely to happen during the season. But if Brady or Rodgers find themselves desperate for help next year, perhaps Bolt will get the call he desires.\n\nUsain Bolt wants to play with Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers.
