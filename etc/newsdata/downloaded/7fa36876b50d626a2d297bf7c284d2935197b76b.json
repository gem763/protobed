The 21-year-old was withdrawn on the hour mark after exhibiting 'flu-like symptoms' during the 2-0 defeat by Canada.\n\nChelsea winger Christian Pulisic challenges Pedro during a training session on Friday\n\nThat has led to speculation that the American could be allowed to leave on loan in January but Lampard flat out refused to entertain the idea ahead of Chelsea\u2019s game against Newcastle.\n\n\u2018No,\u2019 was Lampard\u2019s reply when asked if Pulisic could be loaned out.\n\n\u2018With Christian he\u2019s come to us in a big move, let\u2019s make no mistake about it, and then he\u2019s just turned 21 recently, and we\u2019ve got a competitive squad here.\n\n\u2018I said it before the last game, I always have a problem who to pick and people make my decisions in training or how they\u2019re playing, and at the minute with winning four on the bounce I need the edge of staying in the team and keep performing and everyone is the same.\n\nPulisic was in tears on the bench after being taken off against Canada on Tuesday night\n\n\u2018With Christian coming here, we have to protect him for that fact because he\u2019s young. Christian, as with every player in the squad, needs to work hard in training, keep improving in training, see the direction we\u2019re going, be a part of it, and show what you can do on a match day, and all the players are the same there.\u2019\n\nWhereas Pulisic has struggled, a number of young players have shone for Chelsea this season with Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount, Fikayo Tomori and Callum Hudson-Odoi all turning in impressive performances.\n\nLampard was keen to stress that Pulisic himself is still only young and insisted that he was part of the \u2018big picture\u2019 at Chelsea.\n\nHe added: \u2018With Christian, huge credit to him for coming through at Dortmund at a young age, but then it brings other difficulties where sometimes you\u2019re out of the team.\n\n\u2018You come to Chelsea and it\u2019s a similar situation. The demands are huge. The interest from outside is huge and he\u2019s a young boy. I have no problem. I see the big picture with Christian and I see it with all the young players.\u2019", "description": "Frank Lampard has insisted that Christian Pulisic will not be allowed to leave Chelsea on loan in January despite the winger's slow start to life at Stamford Bridge.", "authors": ["David Wood For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/23/19906072-0-image-a-38_1571438905092.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
