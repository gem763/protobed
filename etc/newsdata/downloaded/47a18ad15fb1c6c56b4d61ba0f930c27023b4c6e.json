But they have now branded the cruise 'the worst trip ever'.

A stop in Reykjavik was cancelled and replaced with a trip to Greenock, near Glasgow \u2013 but the 900ft-long ship was refused permission to dock there on Monday morning, and the captain decided to head to Belfast instead.\n\nBy this point, passengers had endured three days at sea and the ship\u2019s sewage system was \u2018failing\u2019. Many passengers said food served in the restaurants had gone stale. There was further fury when US-based operator Norwegian Cruise Line declined full refunds and offered passengers only a 25 per cent voucher towards a future cruise.\n\nFootage shows hundreds of passengers protesting in the ship\u2019s grand atrium amid chants of \u2018shame on you\u2019, \u2018we want refunds\u2019 and \u2018get us off this ship\u2019. The passengers, including British, American and Chinese tourists, can be heard shouting \u2018take us back to London\u2019 in front of crew members and security guards. One demanded: \u2018I want to see the captain. He should be out here.\u2019\n\nPassengers are seen being addressed by crew on the Norwegian Spirit. Tourists say the ship \u2013 which set off from Southampton on September 27 \u2013 failed to dock in Le Havre or Amsterdam, apparently because of high winds\n\nThe \u2018near rioting\u2019 was filmed on passengers\u2019 phones but one tourist claimed the crew turned off the ship\u2019s internet to stop the footage going online. Passengers later held up placards saying \u2018shame on you\u2019 and \u2018we want refunds\u2019.\n\nDeena Roland, 48, from Taunton, Devon, who was travelling with husband Adrian, 48, said: \u2018There are a lot of angry people on this ship and the lack of adequate explanation as to what\u2019s going on almost caused a riot this morning.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been a nightmare of a holiday, and now many of the toilets in the cabins are overflowing with sewage. It\u2019s really not my idea of a luxury cruise break.\u2019\n\nThe US-based operator Norwegian Cruise Line declined full refunds and offered passengers only a 25 per cent voucher towards a future cruise.

She added: \u2018They won\u2019t speak to us or tell us anything.\n\n\u2018We were promised such an incredible trip to all these amazing places but it turned into the holiday from hell.\u2019\n\nCody McNutt, 31, from Denver, Colorado, said: \u2018We made an unscheduled stop at a small Norwegian town but we soon found out it had been closed to tourists since September 25, so there was nothing for us to do and not even anywhere to get something to eat. Today has been the last straw. We should have been going to Iceland.\u2019\n\nOne tourist claimed the crew turned off the ship\u2019s internet to stop footage of the 'near rioting' going online. Passengers later held up placards saying \u2018shame on you\u2019 and \u2018we want refunds\u2019\n\nYesterday many passengers left the ship after it stopped in Belfast and decided to make their own way back to London.\n\nThe 76,000-ton Norwegian Spirit offers guests 17 dining options, including a steakhouse and Japanese restaurant, 12 bars and lounges, a casino, spa, theatre, fitness centre and aqua park for children.
