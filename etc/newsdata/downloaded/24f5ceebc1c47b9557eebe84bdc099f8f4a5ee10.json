A suspected improvised explosive device was placed beside a parked motorcycle, Major Arvin Encinas, a regional military spokesman, told reporters.\n\nIn April, a bombing by suspected members of a pro-IS militant group injured at least 18 people in a restaurant in Sultan Kudarat in Mindanao region.\n\nMindanao is troubled by banditry and armed rebellions that keep large parts of the region mired in poverty and instability.\n\nIslamist militants operate in the south of the predominantly Roman Catholic nation country and some are known to have links with groups abroad, including al Qaeda and Islamic State.
