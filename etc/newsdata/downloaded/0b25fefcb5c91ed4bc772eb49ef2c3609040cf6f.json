REUTERS/Umit Bektas\n\nFollowing a week of relative calm, Sunday\u2019s march will test the strength of the pro-democracy movement. Campaigners vowed it would go ahead despite police ruling the rally illegal.\n\nIn the past, thousands of people have defied police and staged mass rallies without permission, often peaceful at the start but becoming violent at night.\n\nThe trigger for unrest in Hong Kong had been a now-withdrawn proposal to allow extradition to mainland China, as well as Taiwan and Macau. The case of a Hong Kong man accused of murdering his girlfriend in Taiwan before fleeing back to the city was held up as an example of why it was needed.\n\nLate on Friday the man, Chan Tong-kai, who is jailed in Hong Kong for money laundering, wrote to Lam saying he would \u201csurrender himself to Taiwan\u201d over his alleged involvement in the case upon his release, which could be as soon as next week.\n\nLam said in an interview on Saturday with broadcaster RTHK that it was a relief as it could bring an end to the case.\n\nShe also said that police had used appropriate force in handling the protests, and were responding to protesters\u2019 violence, amid criticism of heavy-handed tactics.\n\nMore than 2,600 people have been arrested since the protests escalated in June.\n\nProtesters\u2019 demands have, since then, swelled far beyond opposing the extradition bill, to take in broader concerns that Beijing is eroding freedoms granted when Britain handed the city back to China in 1997.\n\nChina denies the accusation and has blamed foreign nations such as the United States and Britain for inciting the unrest.\n\nThe crisis in the Chinese-ruled city is the worst since the handover and poses the biggest popular challenge to China\u2019s President Xi Jinping since he took power.\n\nPolice have refused permission for Sunday\u2019s march citing risks of violence and vandalism, which has increased in recent weeks as protesters dressed in black ninja-like outfits have torched metro stations and Chinese banks and shops.\n\nRights group Human Rights Watch said the police move appeared to be aimed at dissuading people from attending.\n\nDemonstrations on Friday were calm, with protesters forming a human chain along the city\u2019s metro network and many donning cartoon character masks in defiance of a ban on covering faces at public rallies.\n\nLam this week outright rejected two of the protesters\u2019 five core demands: universal suffrage and amnesty for those charged during the demonstrations, saying the latter would be illegal and the former was beyond her power.\n\nInstead she has sought to quell the crisis with plans to improve housing supply and ease cost-of-living pressures.\n\nThe atmosphere in the city remains tense.\n\nProminent rights activist Jimmy Sham was brutally beaten by four men wielding hammers and knives during the week, a move pro-democracy lawmakers said was meant to intimidate protesters and incite violence ahead of Sunday\u2019s planned march.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city\u2019s de-facto central bank, said on Saturday that some cash machines will be out of service temporarily, owing to vandalism or to safety considerations.", "description": "Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam took to the airwaves on Saturday to back the use of force by police ahead of a major anti-government march planned this weekend in the Chinese-ruled city, which has been battered by months of violent protests.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442550580&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I029-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
