It's unclear if Dog had a heart attack; doctors are performing tests to determine what happened, and if he will need surgery after the cardiac event. No further information about Dog's condition is available at this time.\n\nDog's hospitalization comes just three months after his beloved wife, Beth Chapman, died after a brutal battle with throat cancer.\n\nRead more: 'Dog the Bounty Hunter' star Beth Chapman was honored with a 'Hawaiian-style' memorial that included a traditional paddle out\n\nThe tragedy, of course, hit Dog hard. He and Beth had been together for decades, and married since 2006. He told \"Entertainment Tonight\" in July that he was having trouble eating following her passing, and had lost 17 pounds in a matter of weeks.\n\n\"I can't eat. Two bites, I'm full. I got to force feed myself like I force fed her,\" he said. \"I never ordered.. I'm having a hard time ordering food. \u2026Chewing ice helps, and I've lost 17 pounds in about two weeks.\"\n\nHe also said that he's been having trouble sleeping. \"I wake up to always touch her, especially when she was sick, I'd have to wake up a few times when she stopped breathing. \u2026 So I'm used to that, and I don't sleep solid anymore.\"\n\nThe premiere of his new show, \"Dog's Most Wanted,\" was a bittersweet experience for the reality star. Beth is featured heavily in the WGN show, which filmed while she was dealing with her cancer.\n\nA source close to Dog told HollywoodLife exclusively in August, shortly before the series premiere, that Dog \"is still very much grieving over the loss of Beth, who was his soul mate, best friend and partner in crime for most of his life. Of course, Dog wishes Beth was here to watch the show with him and while it will be challenging to look back at those memories, it will also bring him peace and comfort knowing she spent her last days doing exactly what she wanted to do.\"\n\nHollywoodLife has reached out to Dog's rep for comment. We will keep you updated as more information becomes available. Our thoughts go out to Dog's loved ones. UPDATE, 9/16/19, 3:10pm ET: A rep for Duane Chapman tells HollywoodLife after his heart emergency and hospitalization that, \"I can confirm Dog is under doctor's care and is resting comfortably. Thank you for all of your well wishes \u2014 keep 'em coming.\"", "description": "The 'Dog's Most Wanted' star recently lost his wife, Beth Chapman, after she battled throat cancer earlier this year.", "authors": ["Samantha Wilson", "Hollywood Life"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8000e821214c7e3865b55a-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
