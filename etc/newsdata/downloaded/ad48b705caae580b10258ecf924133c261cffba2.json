But he didn't respond after having a 'bad day at work'.\n\nAssistant coroner Mr Bird said Chelsea's partner 'should not feel any responsibility arising from that'.\n\nHe said the circumstances that night were no different from the 'usual, ups and downs' that arise in a relationship.\n\n\"In terms of that being a significant issue, with why we are here today, I do not give any weight to it at all,\" Mr Bird said.\n\nRecalling what happened on the day Chelsea died, DC Bloom said: \"She was found by the next door neighbour, Dale.\n\n\"He had come out to feed the birds, on July 13, shortly before midday.\n\n\"Something caught his eye, causing him to look over to Chelsea's property.\"\n\nDale rang 999 and bravely tried to resuscitate Chelsea but to no avail.\n\nThe ambulance service arrived within five minutes of the call, it was said.\n\nThe medical cause of Chelsea's death was asphyxiation due to compression of the neck structures by ligature.\n\nIf you need to speak to someone, Samaritans are available 24/7 on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org", "description": "Chelsea Kyle was found hanged at the bottom of her garden in Devenport", "authors": ["Miles O'Leary", "Kelly-Ann Mills"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20758305.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_301019SLUG_7343JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
