Specifically, Prince Mohammed's decision.\"\n\nPrince Mohammed hopes for a very-optimistic $2 trillion valuation for Aramco, which produces 10 million barrels of crude oil a day and provides some 10% of global demand. That would raise $100 billion he needs for his ambitious redevelopment plans for a Saudi Arabia hoping for new jobs, as unemployment stands at over 10%.\n\nHowever, economic worries, the trade war between China and the United States and increased crude oil production by the U.S. has depressed energy prices. A Sept. 14 attack on the heart of Aramco already spooked some investors. Meanwhile, major companies like Apple and Microsoft have only $1 trillion valuations.\n\nBut the investment forum, coming a year after the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi saw investors shy away from Saudi Arabia, has had more people attend \u2014 likely over the coming IPO.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, speaking at the forum in the first event foreign journalists could film after being locked out the day before, praised the proposed Aramco IPO.\n\n\"The Aramco IPO is going to be a great opportunity to grow the capital markets here and watch its success,\" he said.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
