Elizabeth has quit counselling \u2013 she went for her last session and has come off her anti-depressants. The storyline has attracted some criticism for being unrealistic \u2013 some comments on social media have said that it\u2019s too fast and gives those suffering \u2018real mental illness\u2019 false hope. Experts have joined the conversation to say that actually, 6 months on anti-depressants is very normal, as long as the patient believes it is enough, and particularly if the episode of depression was caused or triggered by a set of events that have been fixed or addressed adequately. In Elizabeth\u2019s case, the depression was triggered by a series of life events \u2013 primarily, Freddie going to jail, then exacerbated by Lily going off to uni with Russ and with the backdrop of long unresolved grief around the death of husband Nigel. With Freddie and Lily back and doing well and therapy for anxiety and depression also addressing her bereavement and the anger, guilt and loss she felt around that, she was in a good place for the medication to give her brain chemistry the reboot it needed while talking therapy and a restructuring of her work and home life gave her the support required to give her confidence, stability and the feeling she could cope again with life\u2019s demands. In those circumstances, it is perfectly reasonable to hope that Elizabeth should feel prepared to taper her meds after 6 months. She has a support network in place and if she experiences a relapse or even wobbles, she knows where to go.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Alf Grundy's back and he wants you to buy him a pint.
