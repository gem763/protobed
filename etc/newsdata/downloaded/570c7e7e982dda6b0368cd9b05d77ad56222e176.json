The inclusion is likely to happen over a 20-month period and draw significant capital flows into the country by next year.\n\nThe head of Bloomberg L.P., Michael Bloomberg, has said his company would help India toward including its bonds in global benchmark indices.\n\nIndia\u2019s federal government and states\u2019 borrowing rose nearly 24% by the end of the year to March 2019 from 2015-16 levels.\n\nThe federal government alone plans to borrow 7.1 trillion rupees in the current fiscal year, up 24% from last year as the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi pushes for infrastructure development.\n\nSeparately, state-owned firms like National Highways Authority of India and Power Finance Corp have been increasing their debt raising plans every year to meet the steep government targets to make new roads and power units.
