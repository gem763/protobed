The number of supported White House hopefuls doubled over that time period as just nine CEOs had made such donations in the first quarter.\n\nThe contributions continue to show corporate leaders backing top politicians in their companies\u2019 home states, with about half of the giving in that vein. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, for example, has received donations from five S&P 500 SPX, +0.03% CEOs \u2014 more than any of her rivals. Four of them are leaders of companies with headquarters in Minnesota.\n\nWhile Klobuchar is among the 10 contenders who met tougher requirements to qualify for Thursday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, she is lagging in polls, getting support of just 1% vs. the 30% support for former Vice President Joe Biden, the front-runner, according to a RealClearPolitics average of polls as of Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe odds are significant that she\u2019ll remain in the Senate, and this [donation activity] is a matter of maintaining the relationship with her,\u201d said Bruce Freed, president of the Center for Political Accountability, a nonprofit that pushes for better disclosure of corporate political activity.\n\nEcolab Inc. ECL, -1.75% CEO Doug Baker and Best Buy Co.\u2019s BBY, -0.29% former CEO Hubert Joly each gave $5,600 to Klobuchar, with Joly\u2019s contribution coming in February while he was still the company\u2019s chief executive. Minnesota\u2019s senior senator also received $2,800 each from General Mills GIS, -1.91% CEO Jeff Harmening and Medtronic PLC MDT, -0.42% boss Omar Ishrak. All four companies have headquarters in Minnesota, although in Medtronic\u2019s case, it\u2019s an operational base, and the legal headquarters is in Ireland. The fifth S&P chief who gave to Klobuchar was Virginia-based Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.\u2019s HLT, +1.13% Chris Nassetta, who contributed $5,600.\n\nA Medtronic spokesman said the company\u2019s policy is to \u201cnot comment on personal political contributions of our executives and employees,\u201d while an Ecolab spokesman said Baker, the CEO, \u201cdoes not have a comment.\u201d A Hilton spokesman said company \u201cwon\u2019t be commenting in this situation,\u201d adding that \u201cpolitical donations by our team members are personal decisions and unrelated to their employment.\u201d Best Buy, General Mills and Klobuchar\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nContributions of $5,600 represent efforts to donate the maximum amount allowed to a candidate. The FEC recently raised the amount an individual can give to a candidate to $2,800 per election, up from $2,700, so donors can shell out $2,800 for the primary election and $2,800 for the general election for a total of $5,600. Candidates who lose or drop out of a primary can use their leftover campaign money on a different run for federal office, and they have other options such as contributing to political allies or refunding the cash to donors.\n\nRead more: What Democrats can do with the money left over from their failed 2020 presidential runs\n\nJust behind Klobuchar\u2019s tally, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker scored donations from four S&P 500 CEOs, including $2,700 from the head of New Jersey-based Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, +2.98% , Charles Lowrey. Booker, who has strong ties to Silicon Valley, also got money from the execs of two California tech companies \u2014 $2,800 from PayPal Holdings Inc. PYPL, -2.26% CEO Dan Schulman and $2,700 from Salesforce.com Inc. CRM, +0.07% Co-CEO Marc Benioff. In addition, New Jersey\u2019s junior senator attracted a contribution of $2,800 from Connecticut-based Amphenol Corp.\u2019s APH, +0.71% R. Adam Norwitt, as shown in the chart above. Salesforce declined to comment, and Prudential, PayPal, Amphenol and Booker\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg drew contributions from three S&P CEOs, including $2,800 from the head honcho at Indiana-based Simon Property Group Inc. SPG, +1.90% , David Simon. Buttigieg also got $5,600 from California-based Netflix Inc.\u2019s NFLX, -2.16% Reed Hastings and $2,800 from New York-based Nielsen Holdings PLC\u2019s NLSN, +3.32% David Kenny. A Netflix spokesman said the company does not comment \u201con our executives\u2019 personal activities,\u201d Nielsen declined to comment, and Simon and Buttigieg\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nSome of Corporate America\u2019s leaders could be aiming to give money to politicians who will end up having significant influence in the future, even if they\u2019re not actually elected president next year, according to the Center for Political Accountability\u2019s Freed. \u201cIf you get a Democratic president, then some of these folks who are running could end up in Cabinet positions,\u201d he said, adding that he thinks Buttigieg \u201chas a future\u201d and is \u201cviewed as a serious, very thoughtful candidate.\u201d\n\nBiden was among four Democratic presidential hopefuls who attracted one donation from an S&P boss. The former Delaware senator received $2,800 from Steven Collis, the CEO of AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, -1.43% , which is based in Pennsylvania, the state where Biden was born and that\u2019s home to his campaign headquarters. Meanwhile, California Sen. Kamala Harris got $2,700 from California-based Salesforce\u2019s Benioff. In addition, Jack Dorsey, CEO of California-based Twitter Inc. TWTR, -2.28% gave $5,600 to Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and $2,000 to entrepreneur Andrew Yang, whose unconventional campaign is centered on promising a guaranteed income of $1,000 a month for every American over age 18.\n\nGiven how Democratic presidential hopefuls have touted their small-dollar donors, how do campaigns think that voters should think about a relatively large contribution from a CEO?\n\nA Biden spokesman, when asked this question, emphasized that regular folks are on the former vice president\u2019s side, saying his campaign is \u201cpowered by hundreds of thousands of grassroots supporters who are backing him.\u201d In the second quarter, the Biden campaign said its average donation was $49, while the corresponding figure for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was $28, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 average was $18, Harris was at $39, and Buttigieg at $47.\n\nRelated: Biden, Sanders and Warren reveal Q2 fundraising figures that trail Buttigieg\u2019s\n\nAnd see: The aggressive fundraising and spending of the 2020 Democrats \u2014 in one chart\n\nWhile Yang isn\u2019t a mainstream candidate, Twitter shareholders aren\u2019t likely to be worried about Dorsey\u2019s contribution to that campaign, Freed said. Dorsey himself is \u201can iconoclast,\u201d and his donation isn\u2019t all that out of the ordinary for someone who heads a relatively new tech company, Freed added. In the filings for Dorsey\u2019s contributions, his employer isn\u2019t listed as Twitter but rather Square Inc. SQ, -1.50% , a payments company that he also leads as CEO, but that isn\u2019t part of the S&P 500.\n\nOne other Democratic contender matched Booker in attracting contributions from four S&P CEOs in this year\u2019s first half \u2014 John Hickenlooper. The former Colorado governor dropped out of the Democratic presidential contest in August, switching to a run for Senate. Hickenlooper got donations from the CEOs of two Colorado-based companies, Ball Corp. BLL, -4.24% and Western Union Co. WU, -0.34% , as well as from the bosses of Nebraska-based Union Pacific Corp. UNP, +0.87% and Louisiana-based CenturyLink Inc. CTL, +5.35%\n\nOther presidential-race dropouts who scored CEO contributions were New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who got money from New York-based Corning Inc.\u2019s GLW, +1.74% boss, and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who received donations from Salesforce\u2019s Benioff and Amphenol\u2019s Norwitt.\n\nRelated: Here are the 20 Democrats running for president, after exits from the race\n\nWhen it comes to contributing to President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election, only one S&P 500 CEO has donated money so far to the Republican incumbent\u2019s principal campaign committee, according to the FEC data on contributions made from Jan. 1 to June 30. Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s VNO, +1.34% Steve Roth gave $200 to that Trump committee, but the New York-based real estate investment trust\u2019s chief exec also contributed $100,000 to the Trump Victory Committee, a joint effort between the president\u2019s principal campaign committee and the Republican National Committee that doesn\u2019t face the same limits on donations as the principal operation.\n\nThe CEO of Pennsylvania-based Universal Health Services Inc. UHS, +3.91% , Alan Miller, also donated to Trump Victory, giving $25,000, and the head of Texas-based Waste Management Inc. WM, -3.35% , Jim Fish, contributed $1,010 to the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, a related joint effort.\n\nRelated: How America\u2019s top CEOs are spending their own money on the midterm elections", "description": "Nineteen chief executive officers of S&P 500 companies so far have given their own money to 2020 Democratic White House hopefuls.", "authors": ["Victor Reklaitis", "Katie Marriner", "Money", "Politics Reporter", "Interactives Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ952_dem_pr_ZG_20190909140316.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
