Instead of potential game-winning touchdowns, the Eagles lost 24-20 to the Falcons and 27-24 to the Lions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re maybe two plays or three plays away from possibly being 3-0 or at least 2-1,\u201d Eagles coach Doug Pederson said. \u201cI just have to remind the guys, \u2018Listen, one play at a time. Don\u2019t lose your focus, stay on task, do your assignment, stay within yourself, don\u2019t go searching for plays. When they come to you, make them.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou just have to keep talking, keep their spirits up. The players know. They\u2019re smart enough. I don\u2019t have to sit there and remind them or beat them over the head with all of that. They understand what could have happened, but look we\u2019re not (3-0). We\u2019re 1-2, and we have some work to do.\u201d\n\nThe Eagles have been slammed by injuries. Defensive tackles Malik Jackson and Tim Jernigan and receivers Alshon Jeffery and DeSean Jackson missed last week\u2019s loss to Detroit, and top cornerback Ronald Darby dropped out with a hamstring injury. Jeffery should be back for Thursday, but the others almost certainly will be ruled out.\n\n\u201cThe season\u2019s young, we\u2019ll get these guys healthy and hopefully we can get things turned around soon,\u201d Pederson said.\n\nThe Packers (3-0) have work to do, as well, even riding high as one of eight undefeated teams in the NFL. Green Bay is tied for No. 23 in scoring and ranked No. 28 in total offense. The acclimation to first-year coach Matt LaFleur\u2019s offense has been slow for the unit as a whole and quarterback Aaron Rodgers in particular.\n\nFor Green Bay, the winning formula has been riding a big-play defense. While the Packers have been beaten up against the run the past two games, they start the week ranked second in points allowed (11.7 per game), first in takeaways (eight), tied for third in sacks (12) and fourth in red-zone defense (33.3 percent touchdowns).\n\nThe offense, however, has been inconsistent at best and bad at worst. While the Packers scored a season-high 27 points last week against Denver, two of the touchdowns were gift-wrapped by the defense.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never wanted to just manage the football game around here. The standards are very high for us,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to play a lot better on offense. We\u2019ve played some good defenses, no doubt about it, but the standard and expectations are very high here, and we haven\u2019t met them on offense.\n\n\u201cThankfully, our defense has not only been opportunistic but stout, holding them to field goals in the red zone, taking the ball away, putting us in good field position. It\u2019s time for us to do our part on offense.\n\n\u201cMoving forward, we\u2019re going to play a stretch of really good football teams. At some point, we can\u2019t expect our defense to shut everybody down. They have been, but at some point, the offense is going to have to wake up and start making some plays.\u201d\n\nGreen Bay is in good shape from a health perspective, with outside linebacker Za\u2019Darius Smith (knee) and tight end Jimmy Graham (groin/quad) being limited practice participants Tuesday.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "The Philadelphia Eagles will limp into Green Bay for the Thursday night game against the undefeated Packers.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433590674&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O05L-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
