Gladys Berejiklian will reintroduce legislation to state parliament, which would force organisers to prepare safety management plans for high-risk events. Under the plan, a licensing fee would be waived for low-risk festivals but others would be forced to pay-up and cover the costs of police and paramedics who are called-in to help. The premier is also rejecting a push from the deputy state coroner to introduce pill-testing to prevent drug-related deaths.
