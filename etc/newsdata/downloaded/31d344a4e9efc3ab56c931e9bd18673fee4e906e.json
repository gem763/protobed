In order to meet the White House\u2019s 2024 deadline for a moon landing, NASA will rely on a stripped-down Gateway at first, and add to the structure during the years that follow.\n\nTo get to the moon\u2019s surface from the Gateway, NASA will need to procure a lunar lander, as well as a transfer vehicle to get the lander from the Gateway\u2019s highly eccentric lunar orbit to a lower, more circular orbit.\n\nAldrin saw that as a bug, not a feature. \u201cSLS cannot get Orion to lunar orbit with any particular maneuver capability \u2014 and that is why we need to go into orbit that is not quite close enough, and now we have to build a big spacecraft,\u201d he complained. \u201cIt takes three spacecraft to make a landing.\u201d\n\nAs an alternative, Aldrin proposed building a reusable trans-orbit craft that would shuttle the astronauts and their hardware from low Earth orbit to low lunar orbit and back. \u201cI dub it the Buzzcraft,\u201d he said.\n\nThe concept is similar to the cycling spacecraft system that Aldrin has long advocated for Mars missions.\n\nSpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy rockets, or Blue Origin\u2019s yet-to-be-built New Glenn heavy-lift rockets, could be used to send astronauts to the trans-orbit craft, and the Space Launch System could be used to send up cargo as needed, he said.\n\nAldrin acknowledged that it\u2019d be tough to make such a radical change in NASA\u2019s architecture for the upcoming Artemis moon missions.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t cancel SLS, we all know that,\u201d Aldrin said. \u201cPolitics and big-company persistence \u2026 lobbyists \u2026 Congress \u2026 that is what has messed up our program.\u201d\n\nIn the long run, he said it would make more sense for the world\u2019s spacefaring nations to combine their efforts under the aegis of a governing body he called the Space Exploration Alliance. In Aldrin\u2019s view, such an alliance should include NASA and its traditional space partners, including Russia, the European Space Agency and Japan. He said it also should include China, which has been largely left out of cooperative space efforts due to U.S. law.\n\nChina has its own plans for missions to the moon and Mars, as does SpaceX.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to require a bigger international organization to bring around the consensus for a plan,\u201d Aldrin said. \u201cWhat is the plan for exploration? Who can offer what? \u2026 How do we make decisions? I don\u2019t think the U.N. is a good model for that. I don\u2019t know what is, but that\u2019s a big challenge.\u201d\n\nHe said that the alliance could make use of private space companies \u2014 including billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin space venture and United Launch Alliance, a Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture \u2014 to turn its consensus vision into a reality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that SpaceX working with NASA, or Blue Origin working with NASA, is going to change things very much. They\u2019re going to go do their thing,\u201d Aldrin said. \u201cBut if there is this Space Exploration Alliance \u2026 working on something somewhere, now there are increased markets, there are increased reasons for SpaceX and Blue Origin to share and to work with the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nEventually, the alliance \u201cshould make room for India, Australia, the Emirates\u201d and other entities that have the capability to advance space exploration, Aldrin said.", "description": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 Apollo 11 moonwalker Buzz Aldrin says there's no need for the lunar-orbiting Gateway outpost that plays a key role in NASA's vision to land astronauts on the moon by 2024.
