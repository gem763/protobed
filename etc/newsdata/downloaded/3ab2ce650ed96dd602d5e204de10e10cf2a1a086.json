But when primary care trusts were abolished six years ago the co-ordinators were replaced by \u2018screening and immunisation leads\u2019. But there are only 23 of these, with each merely responsible for \u2018commissioning\u2019 vaccination services rather than running them.\n\nThe number of local NHS officials directly responsible for immunisation programmes has dropped ten-fold in six years.

In London for example, 31 district immunisation co-ordinators were replaced by a single screening and immunisation lead. Helen Donovan, who leads on public health at the Royal College of Nursing, was a co-ordinator in Haringey, North London, until 2013.\n\nShe said: \u2018I was responsible for 50 or 60 GP practices and I knew them well. I knew the nurses and I had responsibility for scrutinising the data.\u2019\n\nBoris Johnson vowed to examine the issue in his new vaccination strategy, due to be published in the coming weeks.\n\nDr Doug Brown, of the British Society for Immunology, said co-ordinators play a \u2018crucial role\u2019 in ensuring that vaccination rates are kept high.\n\nExperts last night called for the post of district immunisation co-ordinator to be reinstated amid the decline in vaccinations (file image)\n\nAnd Dr Mary Ramsay, Public Health England\u2019s head of immunisation, said: \u2018Strengthening the role of immunisation co-ordinators would mean that local people, who know their communities, are there to support GPs and nurses to ensure children receive vaccinations.\u2019\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: \u2018We are already working to strengthen the role of local immunisation co-ordinators.\u2019", "description": "Experts have called for the post of district immunisation co-ordinator to be reinstated amid the decline in vaccinations.
