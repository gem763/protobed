But even then they couldn\u2019t figure it out: at the presidential level \u2014 and also the level of the conservative intelligentsia \u2014 the response to the populist challenges of Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan in the 1990s was to run away from populism and embrace what George W. Bush in 2000 called \u2018compassionate conservatism\u2019. That formula produced the 2000 map, which saw Bush prevail only with a favorable ruling from the Supreme Court. Bush redoubled his efforts to win religious voters in 2004, but more often the Republican establishment and conservative elite have responded to failure by moving even further away from right-wing populism. The \u2018autopsy\u2019 that followed the GOP\u2019s drubbing in 2012 is a case in point: it prescribed that Republicans should talk and act more like Democrats on issues like immigration.\n\nYet the truth is that the country\u2019s demographic and cultural shifts have destroyed not right-wing populism but orthodox conservatism and Bush-style Republican politics. There is no market on the right or the identity-politics left for what anti-populist Republicans are advertising. The center ground that the Republican establishment of 15 years ago was built upon has disappeared, in large part because of the establishment\u2019s own policies. The Rust Belt wasn\u2019t going to vote Republican to get another war in the Middle East, but it might vote Republican if it meant keeping more jobs in the United States \u2014 and it did vote for Trump in that hope, among other reasons.\n\nThe Republican party will not return to normal after Trump because the norms of 2004 are long gone, along with the map that just barely made the last Republican president\u2019s re-election possible.", "description": "", "authors": ["Daniel Mccarthy", "Spectator.Us Romney-Republicanism-Never-Win"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
