But Poland has taken a strong stand, as we have, to promote energy independence and security,\u201d Mr. Pence said.\n\nThe vice president wielded tough rhetoric even as Mr. Trump employs a soft touch with Mr. Putin.\n\nLast weekend, Mr. Trump urged the Group of Seven industrialized nations to let Russia back into their club, saying it\u2019s easier to have Mr. Putin in the room during thorny negotiations.\n\nMr. Duda took a cautious approach to the debate, saying Russia\u2019s readmission is a \u201cvery complex\u201d issue.\n\nThe country was kicked out of the group for annexing Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, Mr. Duda said, so it\u2019s hard to proceed with \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d when it comes to Russia.\n\nMr. Pence went to Poland this weekend as a stand-in for Mr. Trump, who remained in Washington monitoring the potential landfall of Hurricane Dorian, a Category 5 storm.\n\n\u201cWhen there is a threat coming down to the people, to the country, the president should be in place and keep his hand on the pulse,\u201d said Mr. Duda, explaining he understood the sudden switch.\n\nThe vice president said Mr. Trump wants to reschedule his trip, targeting this fall.\n\nMr. Pence marked the 80th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II in a somber ceremony Sunday, ahead of political meetings with Mr. Duda.\n\nMr. Duda touted American investments in Polish energy production, Poland\u2019s purchases of U.S. military equipment and the addition of American troops in his territory. Earlier this year, Mr. Duda and Mr. Trump agreed to move 1,000 U.S. troops there from Germany.\n\n\u201cThe United States is sending a clear message to the wider world that our commitment to the security of this region, of our relationship with Poland and this alliance, is unwavering,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cSince the agreement was signed in June, sites for our joint bases also have been finalized.\u201d\n\nMr. Pence said the U.S. is close to nominating Poland for the visa-waiver program, to ease travel between the two nations.\n\nAlso Monday, the U.S. and Poland agreed to conduct \u201ccareful and complete evaluation\u201d of any companies providing 5G components and software, as nations build their lightning-fast networks.\n\nLeaders endorsed a set of principles crafted by cybersecurity professionals this year in Prague. The protocols emphasize \u201cthe need for 5G networks to be constructed based on free and fair competition, transparency, and the rule of law.\u201d\n\nThough it doesn\u2019t mention Chinese company Huawei by name, the agreement is viewed as an effort to box out the telecom giant.\n\nThe administration blacklisted Huawei based on fears it is too cozy with the communist Beijing government and could use its 5G equipment for surveillance or to disrupt networks \u2014 charges the company denies.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s aides have urged foreign partners to use other companies in their networks.\n\n\u201cWe recognize 5G networks will only be as strong as their weakest link \u2014 so this agreement will ensure that all components, software and systems are designed with security in mind when developing and deploying 5G,\u201d Mr. Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Marc Short, said. \u201cWe must stand together to prevent the Chinese Communist Party from using subsidiaries like Huawei to gather intelligence while supporting China\u2019s military and state security services \u2014 with our technology.\u201d\n\nMr. Duda said Polish authorities have detected nefarious activities within their networks, though didn\u2019t provide much detail.\n\n\u201cIndeed, behaviors have been detected which can be qualified as actions of an espionage nature,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the Polish services have undertaken appropriate steps.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
