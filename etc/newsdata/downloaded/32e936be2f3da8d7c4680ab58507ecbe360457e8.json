On a few occasions, they even smashed my helmet grille. But there was no question of giving up.\n\n\u201cThey never treated me with kid gloves because I\u2019m a girl. And I always tried to give it back to them. Guess that\u2019s how I developed my hard-hitting batting style.\u201d\n\nVerma\u2019s power-hitting was her ticket to the Velocity team in the Women\u2019s T20 Challenge played alongside the Indian Premier League in May.\n\nThere she shared the dressing room with the likes of England\u2019s World Cup-winning all-rounder Danielle Wyatt, who termed Verma as the next \u201csuperstar\u201d of Indian cricket.\n\nIt also meant mixing with role model and Velocity skipper Mithali Raj, who has been the face of women\u2019s cricket in the country since her India debut two years before Verma was born.\n\nRaj\u2019s decision to quit T20 triggered Verma\u2019s maiden call-up and many saw it as a passing of the baton.\n\nNone of it would have been possible but for Sanjeev\u2019s dogged determination for his daughter to play for India, despite living in Haryana, a state notorious for its male bias and skewed sex ratio.\n\nADAMANT DAD\n\n\u201cI was lucky to have an upbringing that\u2019s so different from most girls of my age. Many scoffed at the idea of a girl playing an outdoor sport with boys, but dad was adamant,\u201d Verma said of her father, a jeweller.\n\n\u201cDespite the discouragement, dad gave me everything that he would give to my elder brother.\n\n\u201cEven after I started playing, people said girls have no future in cricket. But dad shielded me from any cynicism and asked me to focus on cricket only.\u201d\n\nIt was, however, batting great Sachin Tendulkar\u2019s arrival in Rohtak for his Ranji Trophy swansong that really planted the seed of ambition in Verma.\n\nShe was part of the sea of humanity that gathered at Bansi Lal stadium in 2013 to get a glimpse of the retiring maestro.\n\n\u201cSo many people to watch a cricketer, I was just dumbstruck. I asked dad if it could happen to me and he said \u2018If you work hard, nothing is impossible.\u2019\n\n\u201cI took it to heart and have since been working hard.\u201d\n\nVerma, who trains at Rohtak\u2019s Ram Narain Cricket Club, has been chosen for the first three Twenty20s of the five-match series against South Africa, and the youngster is determined to nail her place in the side before flourishing across formats.\n\n\u201cI want to score a lot of runs and cement my place in the Twenty20 team. I also want to play in ODIs,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI think I can play across formats without really overhauling my technique.\u201d", "description": "Shafali Verma was not exactly trying to be a rebel when she began training with the local boys in the north Indian city of Rohtak as a precocious 10-year-old.", "authors": ["Amlan Chakraborty", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
