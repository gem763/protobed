But with the UK parliament failing to play along, he's been forced to ask for an extension and the EU will decide on Monday or Tuesday long it will be.\n\nPresumably unwilling to die in a ditch, Johnson is still holding out hope that parliament will pass his Brexit deal with only a short delay, or agree to a general election that might give him a majority to ram through his deal. So what next?\n\nA disorderly Halloween Brexit looks unlikely. As to the outcome of an election, if there is one -- anyone's guess. Polls suggest Labour are lagging Johnson's Tories but these have proved unreliable in the past. So, what we will get for sure is Brextension and also possibly an election. German wealth manager DWS, meanwhile, remind us of another option -- cancelling Brexit altogether. That seems unlikely but DWS reckons chances of this are close to 50:50.\n\n-EU shelves Brexit delay decision as Britain squabbles over election -DWS cuts no-deal Brexit probability, says \"no Brexit\" has become more likely\n\n2/JUST ONE MORE TIME.. There are no guarantees in life, but a 25 basis point Fed rate cut next week is widely considered a sure thing. You can see it in the CME's FedWatch tool, where odds of a cut in the fed funds target rate to 1.50-1.75% are at 94%. That's up from about 84% a week ago and 64% a month ago.\n\nThe expectations are also apparent in the yield curve, where the spread between 2-year and 10-year Treasuries has widened to around 18 basis points. It was below 4 bps just after the Fed's last rate cut. That slice of the curve inverted in August, sparking fears of a U.S recession that would force the Fed to join the negative rate situation of other developed economies.\n\nThe 3-month/10-year yield curve too has turned positive after being inverted for the most part of six months. That's down to a fall in shorter-dated yields, reflecting confidence the Fed has at least one more cut up its sleeve.\n\nWhat next though?\n\nClues may lie in U.S. company earnings. As we near the half-way mark for the Q3 season, we've seen more upside surprises than misses from S&P 500 companies. That's giving investors a reason to be optimistic about the business cycle. With Friday's October payrolls report likely to show unemployment at its lowest level in half a century and wages ticking up, not too many folks will want to bet the house on a December Fed rate cut.\n\n-Treasury yield curve may be back to normal but U.S. economy is not -Oysters Rockefeller or rotisserie chicken? The Fed is watching 3/SLOWER, DEEPER, LONGER IN JAPAN Once the Fed meeting is past, attention will turn to the Bank of Japan which announces a policy decision the following day. The BOJ is likely to warn markets of slower economic growth than expected and also that policy rates might go even deeper into negative territory. Such messaging would indicate the super-easy policy bias will be extended until possibly end-2020.\n\nGovernor Haruhiko Kuroda says the BOJ could \"certainly\" cut rates further and analysts reckon a move to -0.2% or even -0.3% are possible from the current -0.1%. But no one is quite sure what it would take to make that cut.\n\nExport-reliant Japan is already smarting from the trade war and slowing global demand. A higher sales tax rate has just kicked in. And Japanese banks are feeling the pain of a flat yield curve that keeps even 10-year yields negative. But given the BOJ isn't given to shock and awe, there's palpably more excitement over Tokyo's tiffs with the International Olympic Committee on the schedule for road athletics than next week\u2019s policy meeting. More negative policy rates could leave investors as bleary eyed as the early morning marathoners. -Japan proceeds with twice-delayed sales tax hike as growth sputters- -Kuroda says BOJ can 'certainly' cut short-term rates if it were to ease- 4/BANKS: TIME FOR A BOUNCE?
