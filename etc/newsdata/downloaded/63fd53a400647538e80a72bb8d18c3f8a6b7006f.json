A brand new international cooking comp hosted by Gary Mehigan @crispycrackling, @manufeildel and Matt Preston @MattsCravat. The kitchen is opening soon. Let the flames begin. #7Upfronts pic.twitter.com/tSG0f66tdk \u2014 Seven Network (@SevenNetwork) October 23, 2019\n\nOf course, the show will come after a year of big, big changes at Channel Ten\u2019s MasterChef Australia and Channel 7\u2019s own My Kitchen Rules.\n\nMehigan and Preston separated from the show after fellow judge George Calombaris was found to have chronically underpaid staff at his actual restaurants.\n\nMeanwhile, Feildel\u2019s My Kitchen Rules\u2018 co-host Pete Evans has spent the past year questioning the use of sunscreen, backing an anti-vax podcast, and facing criticism for his role in a Netflix doco about medicinal cannabis.\n\nOf course, cooking programs have changed since MasterChef and My Kitchen Rules first burst into Australian homes, and the real cognoscenti know the best food-adjacent reality TV show is actually Bon Appetit magazine\u2019s YouTube channel.\n\nWhether Gary, Manu, and Matt can compete with Claire Saffitz and Brad Leone in any meaningful way is yet to be seen.\n\n(Actually, you know what: chuck George and Pete in the same kitchen and see what happens. That ought to draw viewers away from the wholesome pleasures of the BA Test Kitchen.)\n\nExpect to see Plate Of Origin pop up some time next year.", "description": "'Plate Of Origin', coming to Channel 7 in 2020, has two very notable omissions.", "authors": ["David Adams"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/plate-of-origin.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
