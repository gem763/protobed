Former employees said they saw him nearly come to blows with a server when he was denied more drinks at H.Wood restaurant Delilah in late 2016 or early 2017.\n\nFormer Delilah employees described Payton as a friend of H.Wood co-owner John Terzian, who allowed the football player to get \"VIP treatment\" at his establishments.\n\nTwo witnesses said that one night, Payton came in and got so drunk that a server was forced to cut him off. The atmosphere inside Delilah is pictured in February 2017. Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for Vanity Fair\n\nPayton got angry and in response, grabbed the server by his collar with one hand and balled up the other as if he was going to punch him. Luckily, the situation de-escalated before coming to blows.\n\nNot long after, Payton was back to eating at the restaurant regularly. Multiple former employees said that anytime Payton came in, the server in question was moved to a different section or taken off the floor.\n\n\"Instead of telling him, 'Hey, you can't come in anymore, you're trying to fight our employees,' they flipped it, which is crazy,\" one former employee said.\n\nPayton strongly denied the story, saying \"I've never touched anyone at [H.Wood].\" The H.Wood Group declined to comment through their PR firm EMC Bowery.\n\nRead more: Drake and a night of violence: How one LA nightclub business allows its employees to be vulnerable to mistreatment by celebrities\n\nThe incident is part of what some former employees see as a trend \u2014 instances where they felt the needs of H.Wood's VIPs had been put above the safety and general wellbeing of the restaurant group's employees.\n\n\"It's client-based \u2014 clients first, employees last,\" one former employee said.\n\nIn another troubling example unearthed by Insider, former employees told us about an incident in which a bottle service girl was brought outside and into an SUV by MMA fighter Conor McGregor's entourage, resulting in a manager threatening to call 911.\n\nThere's also the incident that prompted Insider's investigation. Last year, TMZ released surveillance footage of a man being assaulted outside Delilah. That man later turned out to be Delilah server Bennett Sipes, who had come to the restaurant on his night off. He has since filed a lawsuit against The H.Wood Group and several notable people who were there that night \u2014 Drake, current Cleveland Browns wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., and Kourtney Kardashian's ex Younes Bendjima. Bendjima is seen on the surveillance footage hitting Sipes, while the other two men are accused by Sipes of encouraging the attack.", "description": "Witnesses say the ex-NFL player nearly punched a server after the server cut him off for getting too drunk in the LA hotspot.", "authors": ["Ashley Collman"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9e446b695b5843e91ac64d?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
