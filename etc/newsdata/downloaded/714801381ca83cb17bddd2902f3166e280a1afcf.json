(AP) - A new art exhibit explores Thomas Jefferson\u2019s highly influential architectural ideas and his vision for structures that symbolize liberty and democracy.\n\nBut the exhibit also strives to spotlight some of the enslaved workers who helped construct many of the buildings that Jefferson designed.\n\nThe exhibit opens Saturday at the Chrysler Museum of Art in Norfolk, Virginia. The show offers another reckoning over the founding father\u2019s legacy and the role of enslaved Americans in U.S. history.\n\nExhibit curator Erik Neil says Jefferson envisioned buildings for a new republic, not old-world kings. The domes and columns in his designs purposefully recalled ancient Greece and Rome.\n\nBut he said it\u2019s impossible to talk about Jefferson without talking about the issue of slavery and race in America.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A new art exhibit explores Thomas Jefferson's highly influential architectural ideas and his vision for structures that symbolize liberty and democracy.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ben Finley"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
