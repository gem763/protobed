At the same time, business inventories were flat for August, missing Wall Street expectations for 0.3% growth.\n\nThe disappointing data caused Goldman Sachs to cut its tracking estimate by 0.3 percentage point to 1.7%. HFE represented the top of the estimates at 2%, while Oxford Economics was at the other extreme with a 1.2% forecast.\n\nThe CNBC/Moody's tracker is somewhat more pessimistic than other gauges.\n\nFor instance, the Atlanta Fed's GDP Now measure puts growth at 1.8%, actually up one-tenth of a point following Wednesday's sales and inventory data. The New York Fed's Nowcast is at 2% but hasn't been updated since Oct. 11.\n\nIf the Rapid Update projection holds and is correct, it will mark only the second time since Q2 of 2016 that GDP fell below 2%.", "description": "Weak consumer spending and inventory data caused economists responding to the RapidUpdate tracker to lower their collective GDP projections by one-tenth of a percentage point to the lowest level yet for Q3.", "authors": ["Jeff Cox"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/101888112-452983112.jpg?v=1406915265", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
