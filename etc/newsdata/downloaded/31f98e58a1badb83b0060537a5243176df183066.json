After a violent crash in April 2018 between a semi and a bus claimed the lives of 16 people and forever changed the lives of countless more, most of us will never forget it.\n\nThe driver of the rig, Jaskirat Singh Sidhu, plowed through a stop sign, hitting the bus full of hockey players and team personnel, is serving an eight-year sentence after pleading guilty.\n\nHe\u2019d been driving a semi for three weeks at the time of the crash; his training had consisted of two weeks with someone in the truck with him, and the last week on his own. New regulations \u201csignificantly expanded the amount of classroom and practical training for new drivers piloting semis and buses, added higher fees and introduced stricter written and road tests,\u201d as reported in the Globe & Mail.\n\nThe crash highlighted the lack of driver training and oversight, and three provinces \u2013 Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba \u2013 tightened regulations in the industry as a result. Families of those killed and injured vowed not to let governments backslide on a commitment to making sure it never happened again.\n\nPreviously, only Ontario had mandatory driver training for semi drivers, though many independent companies do have rigorous training in place. Earlier this year, those other three provinces announced new training regulations, and by 2020, the federal government will require training across the country.\n\nNow, with the turn of a new government in Alberta, that province has once again relaxed training of those piloting semis for agricultural use, and for school buses. The outcry was instantaneous, with parents of those who lost children incensed and taking to social media.\n\nToby Boulet, of Lethbridge, Alberta, lost his son Logan in the horrific crash. He has been outspoken in pushing for better training for those drivers like the one who took his son\u2019s life. He is enraged at the news his province is considering exemptions for farm workers and school bus drivers.\n\nThe original exemption made sense, to give those sectors time to get caught up. Saskatchewan and Manitoba did the same thing. But now, these exemptions in Alberta are stretching into 2020, and beyond.\n\nCTV reported on October 2 that Alberta\u2019s minister of transportation, Ric McIver, said \u201ca review is underway but it\u2019s still \u2018too early\u2019 in the process to have even started consultations.\u201d By October 8, the Globe & Mail was reporting it was a done deal. McIver\u2019s office issued a statement running over some of the licensing changes, including this bit: \u201cRegarding farm workers and school bus drivers, the NDP Government first issued an extension, which the current government then extended to accommodate the start of the school year and harvest. The government will be consulting with key stakeholders on this matter, and safety will remain paramount.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s that paragraph that has Boulet, and many others, incensed. Using only vague terminology and saying \u201csafety is our top priority\u201d there is no promise from the government that continual exemptions won\u2019t lead to permanent ones. Reverting to previous standards, deciding they\u2019re good enough for school kids, and also deciding a semi isn\u2019t a semi if it isn\u2019t being driven very far, will be met with harsh backlash.\n\nBasically, members of the agricultural sector of that province were pushing back against the new mandate. Farmers wanted to know why their drivers needed weeks of expensive new training to essentially be driving from field to field. Same with school bus drivers. The new training (before MELT \u2013 \u201cmandatory entry level training\u201d \u2013 there were no training requirements) requires substantial time and money investment.\n\nBoulet is concise. \u201cIf there is to be a compromise, it can only be economic, not safety. Create subsidies or tax breaks for those who require them,\u201d he says. \u201cBut a human life is not equivalent to a load of grain, and those vehicles all share the road. Mr. Sidhu was not trained, but he was only the head of the snake.\u201d\n\nPreviously Class One drivers (tractor trailer) and Class Two drivers (bus) were all included in new, stricter rules brought into effect in March of 2019 through MELT. Farm drivers and school bus drivers were initially given an exemption to compliance until November 30 and July 30 of this year, respectively. That has now been extended an additional year, into July 2020 for school bus operators; and March 2021 for farmers. With last week\u2019s announcement, those drivers would be only subject to an as-yet-unspecified abstract review.\n\nDavid Ham lives in Abbotsford, B.C. and retired two years ago after a 40-year career driving big rigs. He\u2019s witnessed a sea change in not just the trucking industry, but also in the public\u2019s response to drivers in general.\n\nIt\u2019s a backdoor loophole that could allow far less rigorously trained drivers on Alberta\u2019s roadways\n\nIn his view, the industry invites rigorous oversight and regulation.\n\n\u201cThe public is poorly served by lack of accountability,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if there are allowances made for seasonal drivers, like those for harvest, I don\u2019t see why that would exempt people. Training is training is training.\u201d\n\nA combine waddling down the road between concessions is not a semi. Ham has relevant experience: he started driving a silage truck on a farm in Alberta when he was 14.\n\nHam\u2019s concern with the exemptions is warranted. Buried in the proposed changes to ease up on those two classes of drivers is the real kicker, from the G&M report: \u201cDrivers with Class 1 and Class 2 licences who received farming or school-bus exemptions will be eligible to keep their commercial licences without taking the enhanced safety tests. Instead, Alberta will evaluate driving records and waive tests for drivers who regulators deem safe; after that, the drivers would have full commercial licences that would not be restricted to farming or school-bus driving.\u201d\n\nThe emphasis is mine. It\u2019s a backdoor loophole that could not only create a non-level playing field for commercial drivers, but that could also allow far less rigorously trained drivers on Alberta\u2019s roadways.\n\nMcIver\u2019s office keeps indicating the former NDP government created the problem by dismantling Alberta\u2019s privatized licensing system, and created a backlog of drivers waiting to be tested. Every government blames the last, but Toby Boulet and David Ham, both in constant contact with many parts of the trucking industry, make the point there is a glut of qualified drivers looking for work. And if ever there was a need for an overhaul of the licensing system, this explosive expos\u00e9 by the Globe & Mail reveals it.\n\nThe last word goes to Toby Boulet. \u201cWe want to be focused on our work with organ donation advocacy, taking care of our daughter Mariko and grieving for our son Logan. This change in law for better driver training was already solved.\u201d", "description": "The Humboldt tragedy should have signalled we need stricter trucking laws \u2014 some legislators didn't get the message", "authors": ["Hours Ago"], "top_image": "https://postmediadriving.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/humboldt-crash-semi-truck-rig-1.jpg?quality=80", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
