I awoke Saturday morning to the news that cable television\u2019s favorite liberal news show anchor has signed on to a recurring role in The CW\u2019s Batwoman.\n\nMaddow made the announcement that she will play the character Vesper Fairchild in the new superhero series. The premiere episode airs Sunday. What sets Batwoman apart from other superhero shows is that Batwoman is a lesbian. And her character is played by an openly out lesbian actress, Ruby Rose.\n\nI know no one's going to believe this is true, but it's true. I'm \"Vesper Fairchild\" in the new Batwoman TV show that starts this Sunday night on The CW. (My character is soooo not me; turns out playing her is one of the most fun things I've ever done).https://t.co/LP8PauXvUL \u2014 Rachel Maddow MSNBC (@maddow) October 4, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s the twist \u2013 Maddow\u2019s character doesn\u2019t appear on the screen. Vesper Fairchild, like Maddow, is a broadcast personality.\n\nMaddow takes on the role of Vesper Fairchild, a character from the Batman comics. Fairchild is a television and radio personality who had a romantic relationship with Bruce Wayne (Batman). The Batwoman catch is that Maddow\u2019s Fairchild will never appear onscreen \u2014 at least there are no current plans for her to do so. Still, Maddow is expected to \u201cappear\u201d in multiple episodes.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear exactly how Maddow will \u201cappear\u201d but maybe it will be like the old John Forsythe character in the original Charlie\u2019s Angels television series. His character\u2019s voice was in episodes but he remained sight unseen. Perhaps her voice will substitute for her physical presence.\n\n\u201cWe consider Vesper Fairchild to be the sardonic Voice of Gotham,\u201d Batwoman showrunner Caroline Dries told THR. \u201cIn addition to Rachel\u2019s interest in Batwoman, we thought she\u2019d be the perfect casting choice because her own hard-hitting journalism wildly contrasts Vesper\u2019s penchant for snark, gossip and criticism of female superheroes.\u201d\n\n\u201cHard-hitting journalism\u201d, eh?\n\nI\u2019m not really familiar with the Batwoman character. She was created as a part of the whole Batman universe. I watched Batman as a kid \u2013 I remember Adam West \u2013 and then the Batman movies but my interest has waned. After Michael Keaton\u2019s portrayal of Batman, the more current actors playing Batman don\u2019t measure up for me. Your mileage may vary. Woke Rachel may feel a personal connection and this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s been a part of Batwoman\u2019s history.\n\nThis will be the political commentator\u2019s second connection to the world of Batwoman, the DC Comics series about an out lesbian superhero. She previously wrote an introduction for the 2010 deluxe hardcover edition of writer Greg Rucka\u2019s Batwoman graphic novel Elegy. (That collected Detective Comics issues 854-860.)\n\nOur superheroes have to have political messages now, you know, and that includes the ones made for television. Supergirl is a good example of how off the rails a show can go from its original concept. I watched that show when it first began. Full Disclosure: I covered Supergirl for NewsBusters. It began innocently enough. But, as it grew in popularity, the series went in a decidedly liberal way with all the usual hot button issues dragged into the storyline. If I remember correctly, I only watched and wrote about the first two seasons. I\u2019m happy I no longer have to watch it. Hollywood liberals ruin everything.\n\nIt may be interesting to see how the show brings in Vesper Fairchild. From what I read, she was killed off by orders given by Lex Luther. No wonder she won\u2019t appear.\n\nMaddow isn\u2019t the only media personality with a Hollywood deal these days. CNN\u2019s Dana Bash has inked a side gig of her own.\n\nIt was at least the second deal announced this week involving the mainstream media and the world of showbiz. On Thursday came word that CNN political correspondent Dana Bash will consult on \u201cThe Hill,\u201d a drama series in development for NBC.\n\nHere\u2019s the trailer for Batwoman:", "description": "Fantasy", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/18e54c64-9d85-40f6-bdfd-1dc326144cf4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
