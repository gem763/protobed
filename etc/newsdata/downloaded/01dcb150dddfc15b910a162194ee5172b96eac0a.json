And that reality may mean bad news for the likes of IBM and Oracle, according to a survey from Flexera.\n\nOverall, respondents to the Flexera survey spent 8.2% of revenue on IT. Companies with more than 10,000 employees spent 9.3% of revenue on IT. Top priorities were digital transformation, cybersecurity, customer experience and migrating to the cloud.\n\nFlexera surveyed 303 IT executives working in large enterprises with 2,000 or more employees, headquartered in North America and Europe.\n\nThe Flexera State of Tech Spend report had a few findings that illustrate the shift in power among enterprise tech vendors to the top cloud providers.

For instance, 86% of respondents expect a slight or significant increase in IaaS and PaaS with 81% expecting to spend more on SaaS. But 55% expect to decrease spending on on-premise software.\n\nMeanwhile, that surge in cloud infrastructure spending comes as the enterprise data center footprint is shrinking. Flexera found that 65% of respondents plan to reduce data center spending as well as the number of facilities.", "description": "A Flexera report captures current sentiment for enterprise technology giants including those gaining and losing IT spend.", "authors": ["Larry Dignan"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/12/8d4f3cf7-47df-4aca-b268-c1d665356f32/thumbnail/770x578/8a88cf0196df5170f9c27c968ce21a12/flexera-2020-spending-1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
