For this reason, open and concrete discussions on this theme are needed now more than ever,\u201d Francis told the participants.\n\nThey include Mitchell Baker, executive chairwoman of Mozilla, Gavin Corn, associate general counsel and director of the cyber security law team at Facebook, Western Digital senior vice president Jim Welsh and Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn.\n\nFrancis said technology needed \u201cboth theoretical and practical moral principles\u201d.\n\nHe warned of the dangers of the use of artificial intelligence \u201cto circulate tendentious opinions and false data that could poison public debates and even manipulate the opinions of millions of people, to the point of endangering the very institutions that guarantee peaceful civil coexistence\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf mankind\u2019s so-called technological progress were to become an enemy of the common good, this would lead to an unfortunate regression to a form of barbarism dictated by the law of the strongest,\u201d he said.\n\nThe conference is taking place amid the rise of cyber espionage, online hate speech and misuse of private data, and signs the industry is struggling to respond.\n\nIt is the latest example of the Vatican trying to stay ahead of the curve on technology and social issues in order to influence the pioneers of the future, regardless of their religion.\n\nVatican officials said it could provide material for a possible papal document on artificial intelligence, much as meetings with scientists helped shape his landmark 2015 encyclical \u201cLaudato Si\u201d on the protection of the environment and global warming.", "description": "Pope Francis urged Silicon Valley giants on Friday to make sure technological advances such as artificial intelligence do not lead to a new \"form of barbarism\" where the law of the strongest prevails over the common good.", "authors": ["Philip Pullella", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434492297&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0OE", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
