Elizabeth Warren then attacked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for his company's policy of not removing campaign ads just because the Democrats claim something is untrue about them. In this instance, Zuckerberg sided with the First Amendment, saying people should be allowed to know which politicians are dishonest and decide for themselves what to believe.\n\nThat was last week. This week, Joe Biden lied in a campaign ad.\n\nIn his ad, Biden claims he met with every victim's family in the Sandy Hook shooting. This was quickly proven to be a lie when a family member of one of the victims took to Twitter to point out that his family, who lost a six-year-old son, never met with Joe Biden and were not allowed onto Air Force One because they did not support Obama-Biden's gun control policies.\n\nThis is a lie. Obama came to Sandy Hook and met with every family. Joe Biden DID NOT.\n\n\n\nIn fact, my family was not allowed on Air Force One because we refused to support Obama/Biden gun control efforts. https://t.co/SSIv7SpHVL \u2014 JT Lewis (@thejtlewis) October 23, 2019\n\nSo that didn't take long.\n\nJT Lewis, 19, is a candidate for the Connecticut State Senate. He gave an interview on \"Fox & Friends: First\" with host Rob Schmitt to set the record straight.\n\n(Via Fox News) \"Joe Biden wasn't there, and what he talks about in his videos is firsthand experience with families and first responders, and I wanted to clarify that it was actually President Obama who came there in the days after the shooting and met with us and helped us through that really tragic time,\" said Lewis. \"Look, I know Joe Biden's coming from a place of sympathy having lost his son, and I know he means well. But, when you get these little things mixed up, it comes across very negatively.\"\n\nThe Democrats tell actual lies in their campaign ads. But they want to ban Republican ads because they bring up facts the Democrats don't want people knowing about.\n\nWatch the latest video at foxnews.com", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden called on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to remove a Trump campaign ad which the Biden campaign criticized for promoting a \"conspiracy theory.\".10/25/2019 19:38:28PM EST.", "authors": ["Bronson Stocking", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/255/24a026cb-4146-43a0-9d68-155428ebe069.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
