Cassel, professor of medicine at University of California at San Francisco, who co-chaired the committee of experts that wrote the report.\n\nAD\n\nIt is alarming and tragic, she and other committee members noted, that the system is hurting the very people we have put in charge of healing us as a society.\n\nIn recent years, as the medical community has grown increasingly alarmed over the problems of burnout, the proposed solutions have focused on increasing the resilience of individual doctors and nurses. \u201cWhat this report is saying is that this is a systemic problem that requires systemic solutions,\u201d said Cassel, a former president of the American Board of Internal Medicine. \u201cYou can\u2019t just teach doctors meditation, yoga and self-care. We need big, fundamental changes.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe committee\u2019s experts \u2014 which included doctors, nurses, health executives and leaders in bioethics, neurology and pharmacy \u2014 spent 18 months wading through mountains of research on clinician burnout. They found that between 35 and 54 percent of nurses and doctors experience burnout. Among medical students and residents, the percentage is as high as 60 percent.\n\nAD\n\nSymptoms, they said, include emotional exhaustion, cynicism, loss of enthusiasm and joy in their work and increasing detachment from their patients and the patients\u2019 ailments. The problem has been linked to higher rates of depression, substance abuse and suicide. The suicide rate among physicians, for example, is twice that of the general population and one of the highest among all professions.\n\nHealth-care workers are especially prone to burnout, the report found, because of the workload, pressure and chaos that they deal with each day. As the country\u2019s health-care system has become increasingly dysfunctional, the bulk of that dysfunction has landed on them \u2014 resulting in long hours, mounting paperwork and bureaucratic hurdles, fear of malpractice lawsuits and insufficient resources.\n\nAD\n\nThe problem often starts with a well-intentioned, perfectly reasonable law, explained co-author Vindell Washington, chief medical officer at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana. That is turned into a regulation, which is interpreted and made into a policy, often taking the most conservative path possible for legal protection.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAt every step, the original intent gets a little misinterpreted or picks up an unexpected effect,\u201d Washington said.\n\nA law about patient privacy, for example, becomes a quirk on a doctor\u2019s terminal that ends their sessions every few minutes, requiring them to repeatedly log in throughout the day \u2014 adding frustration and burden to their days.\n\nAD\n\nComplex regulations on hospital reimbursement gives rise to a long list doctors must tic through in physical exams, even as they try to figure out what\u2019s ailing a patient, so hospitals can charge more or less based on the exam\u2019s complexity. \u201cThe problem is we\u2019re not workers in a factory making widgets,\u201d Washington said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly inefficient, and the workload is unsustainable,\u201d said Liselotte Dyrbye, a doctor and researcher at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cThe system is built for billing and not taking care of patients.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBurnout is also expensive. One study cited by Wednesday\u2019s report, for example found it costs the medical system $4.6 billion a year. Some of that cost comes from doctors reducing their hours, quitting their jobs or leaving medicine altogether. With each doctor affected by burnout, the estimated average cost to the medical industry in America is roughly $7,600. Those numbers did not include the costs of increased medical errors, malpractice lawsuits and other doctors\u2019 having to pick up their burned-out colleagues\u2019 work.\n\nAD\n\nThat financial incentive is imperative, because alleviating burnout will require significant buy-in from federal regulators, insurance companies, medical schools and the country\u2019s health-care systems.\n\nWednesday\u2019s report outlined a hefty list of needed changes:\n\nHealth-care organizations should create executive-level chief wellness officers to monitor and protect clinicians\u2019 well-being and develop IT programs to reduce repetitive and redundant paperwork.\n\nMedical and nursing schools should train students to deal with burnout. Federal and state regulators should identify and eliminate overlapping regulations.\n\nMedical licensure agencies should find ways for doctors to seek help without having it used against them, such as in malpractice litigation.\n\nFederal officials should develop a coordinated research agenda to understand the problem and how to alleviate it.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "As many as half of all clinicians suffer from burnout symptoms, creating risks to patients, malpractice claims and absenteeism, a national study finds.", "authors": ["William Wan", "National Correspondent Covering Health", "Science"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/eVxQXRt3mkKT6uyWyN26cAPQgLg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MG5Z7HHF7UI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
