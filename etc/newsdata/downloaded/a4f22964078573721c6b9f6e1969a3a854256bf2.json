A crescendo rumble, a deafening crash, a four-letter word. The blond skateboard king from behind the cycle shed, his shirt-tails flapping, has fallen off yet again. Unfortunately, the cracked pavement under his wheels is called Britain, or optimistically the United Kingdom, and he and his mates have been pounding it to destruction for more than three years.\n\nIn that time, the Brexit ordeal has changed Britain. Not as much as some think. Many of these changes, above all the English sense of powerlessness and resentment of elites, were already gathering speed 10 years ago, as Europe and the world crawled out of the banking disaster. Brexit disputes only accelerated them. The 2016 referendum didn\u2019t so much create new divisions within England as rediscover old ones, especially in its aftermath. It was almost laughable that so few remain voters knew a leaver, or vice versa. England is still a country astonishingly segregated by class, by location, by attitudes towards power and privilege. Before the last war ended, the doomed fighter pilot Richard Hillary asked: \u201cWas there perhaps a new race of Englishmen arising out of this war, a harmonious synthesis of the governing class and the great rest of England?\u201d No, there wasn\u2019t.\n\nEnglish Tories have lost the slightest reason to care about the union | Kevin McKenna Read more\n\nOne sinister change, still developing, is the breakdown of Britain\u2019s immunity against lies. From about 2010 onwards, Conservative leaders began to blame the public spending of previous Labour governments for the huge financial deficit caused by the bank crash. What was most appalling was not the barefaced untruth. It was that nobody seemed to have the energy to rebut that lie. Millions of people were left to believe it, and probably still do. The Brexit campaign released an avalanche of feebly contested lies, on which the present prime minister still happily slaloms.\n\nWithin England, political geography has changed. More accurately, the way people see the enormous gap in wealth, opportunity, infrastructure and innovation between the London region and \u201cEngland outside London\u201d has sharpened. The \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d efforts, and HS2, only revive a long history of sticking-plaster remedies for what were once called \u201cdistressed areas\u201d.\n\nThe change now is that two streams of bitter resentment \u2013 at London\u2019s unfair wealth and privilege and at Westminster\u2019s unfair refusal to \u201cobey the people\u201d \u2013 have converged into a single torrent. London is the most spectacularly diverse metropolis in Europe, which even after Brexit will go on sucking in the money of global oligarchs and hedge funds, and the location of new British institutions. London as an independent city state, like Singapore, would prosper, but in the short term it will bankrupt whatever is left of Hillary\u2019s \u201cgreat rest of England\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s commonly said that the Brexit years have made the English more xenophobic, less tolerant, more angrily divided among themselves. The first is clearly true. Non-British Europeans confirm a new nastiness, even just a new coldness. So, even more emphatically, will migrants from Somalia, Nigeria, India, Bangladesh.\n\nIt\u2019s true that English dislike of foreigners is ancient, abating in the middle 19th century as the public welcomed political refugees from failed revolutions, but only for an interval. A recent example: in a sample of adults in Scotland who list Pakistani as their ethnicity, 31% identified as Scottish. The corresponding sample taken in England found only 15% identifying as English. That tells you nothing particularly wonderful about Scotland, except that it\u2019s a normal country. But it does tell a tale about England: a nation self-consciously unlike others and uneasy about sharing its \u201cessence\u201d with others.\n\nMore angry, more violent in the course of these three years? Very angry, certainly, but no angrier (and so far much less violent) than their great-grandparents were over Irish home rule or rights for women. Or, come to that, than some of their fathers and mothers were over the miners\u2019 strike or the poll tax. It\u2019s remarkable that in the past three years it\u2019s the remainer half of Britain that goes roaring down the streets. The leavers, with their own powerful case to feel aggrieved and betrayed, stay at home and share their wrath with family and friends. England has a vigorous history of rioting. But for this generation, the default leave position seems to be: \u201cLeave us in peace! Get it done, and go away.\u201d There is much talk about the need to reform Britain\u2019s democracy, but nothing like any coherent idea of what should replace it.\n\nAt the core of the three-year wrangle is constitution fuzziness. Where does final authority rest? Is it with the people, speaking through a referendum? Or with a prime minister claiming in a spooky way that he embodies the Queen and her prerogative ? Or with the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty? Nobody knows. The result is skateboard politics: an empty thunder of promises, then reckless plunges and then crashes into failure.\n\nPlay Video 1:37 Gina Miller: supreme court ruling shows the PM is not above the law \u2013 video\n\nBut meanwhile, and quietly, something utterly transforming has been seeping into politics. The law is beginning to infiltrate the tattered old doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty. It\u2019s years since \u201cjudicial review\u201d of government decisions began to wear moth-holes in the doctrine\u2019s fabric. Now the Brexit arguments have jerked the process into high gear: the supreme court\u2019s decision to strike down Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation was a blow in favour of democracy. But Gina Miller was mistaken to dash out of the courtroom and proclaim a victory for parliamentary sovereignty. In the long term, Lady Hale and her judges have torn a huge rent in that doctrine. They have brought closer the moment when all the rents and moth-holes run together and parliament (as in all modern democracies) becomes subject to supreme constitutional law.\n\nThe other day, Michael Ignatieff \u2013 once leader of Canada\u2019s Liberals \u2013 disconcerted his British TV hosts by saying that British democracy was working well. What I think he meant was that the civilities were still preserved: \u201cthe honourable member\u201d and so forth. Politicians see it differently, after three years of increasingly rude and aggressive language flung about the Commons. But Ignatieff, who knows England even better than his native Canada, sees further. As yet, Brexit has not led to fist-fights in the chamber, as seen in Ukraine or Italy. This is interesting, as in the last century MPs from time to time brawled round the dispatch box, even when sober. But it\u2019s half a century ago that Bernadette Devlin sprang across the floor and belted Reggie Maudling, the home secretary, across the face. Today, passive contempt for the other lot is more common than active fear and hated. For the moment, basic civility survives between Britons, who take their frustrations out on foreigners.\n\nBut the deepest change since 2016 is the weakening of the United Kingdom\u2019s inner bonds. Theresa May went around preaching about \u201cour precious, precious union\u201d. This puzzled me, given massive English indifference. Ask somebody in Durham or Exeter why the union matters, and you get a blank stare, a shrug and perhaps a mumble. Then I understood: it wasn\u2019t Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland that was \u201cprecious\u201d to her, but \u201cthe union\u201d in the abstract \u2013 a sort of legitimising halo hovering over Westminster\u2019s anointed. It\u2019s a cult confined to Britain\u2019s ruling caste and, of course, to Scottish and Irish unionists who genuinely have something to lose.\n\nEngland can be better than the Brexit caricature. We have to make the case for it | John Harris Read more\n\nThe \u201cgreat rest of England\u201d seem to have felt for many years that if the Scots want to leave, \u201cit seems a pity but it\u2019s their right\u201d. Few southerners would feel diminished. Many believe, incorrectly, that England subsidises Scotland. Since 2016, Scotland\u2019s heavy vote to stay in the EU, and the SNP\u2019s incessant campaigning against any sort of Brexit, have become a severe irritant to \u201cBritish\u201d politics. Devolution is working more scratchily month by month, and the common English assumption for the past few years has been that Scottish independence is inevitable. Curiously, this is not how it looks in Scotland, where minds change slowly and where it\u2019s far from certain that the next independence referendum will drag the yes vote over the line.\n\nIn the union of four nations, one \u2013 England \u2013 has 85% of the population. What the past three years have shown is that the big partner is no longer concerned to put its own interests behind those of the others. A poll this year showed that Tory voters would be ready to \u201close Scotland\u201d (revealing words) if that ensured Brexit. In turn, devolution only made sense when all four nations were inside the European Union. If England in 2019 can no longer remember why the union with Scotland and Northern Ireland once made sense, Brexit has delivered the United Kingdom to the hospice of history.\n\n\u2022 Neal Ascherson is a writer, journalist and historian", "description": "Three years of wrangling have broken the bonds of union, says historian and journalist Neal Ascherson", "authors": ["Neal Ascherson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/767688c684241d4f90071627d4f9c63ab7c26d58/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=834cc8df5bf81121d5dfa751bcf3504f", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
