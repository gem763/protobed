They don\u2019t share data on the prevalence of assaults on their platforms. They don\u2019t reveal details on how drivers are paid. What we do know is that both these companies are struggling since going public... Clearly, this business model is not sustainable.\n\nUber on Monday confirmed it had received DeFazio's request.\n\nLyft said this week it would work with lawmakers and said the committee is reviewing \"important topics that we take very seriously. We look forward to future discussions.\"\n\nThe companies did not immediately comment Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Writing by Susan Heavey and David Shepardson; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Chizu Nomiyama)", "description": "Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft Inc declined to appear on Wednesday at a U.S. House of Representatives hearing on issues relating to the ride-hailing industry, a congressional committee said.
