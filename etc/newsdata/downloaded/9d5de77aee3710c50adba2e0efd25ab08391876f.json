Brendan Rodgers oh-so-nearly punished his former club for missing several clear-cut chances and dented their nascent title aspirations. James Maddison cancelled out Mane\u2019s strike with 10 minutes remaining. At that point, it appeared as though a point at Anfield would boost Leicester\u2019s top-six credentials.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Marc Albrighton was the culprit, running himself into trouble inside his own penalty area in the second minute of four added-on. While inexplicably steering the ball away from his team-mate Kasper Schmeichel, he scraped Mane\u2019s ankles. VAR upheld the penalty decision, Milner made it count.\n\nLiverpool, in fairness, had enough chances to win this game comfortably. Milner, Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah all missed close-range opportunities.\n\nAt least one of those should perhaps have been scored. The afternoon would have been a lot easier. Instead, a Leicester fightback always felt likely, even if their attack was somewhat blunt.\n\nAnd yet, for the seventeenth time on the bounce, Liverpool win. For the third consecutive league game, the three points were earned by a single goal. In a climate where draws are the new defeats, that is an invaluable quality. It is also, perhaps, an unsustainable one.", "description": "Another nervy 90 minutes, another imperfect performance, but another three points.
