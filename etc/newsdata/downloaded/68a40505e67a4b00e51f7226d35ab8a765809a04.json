The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported 8 civilians killed as a result of Turkey's military offensive.\n\nThe Turks consider the Kurds to be a group of stateless terrorists allied with a Kurdish political insurgency inside Turkey. But the Kurds were key to the U.S. in the fight against ISIS in Syria. And now, under a barrage of Turkish bombs, the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces have been forced to abandon their posts guarding prisons holding thousands of ISIS fighters.\n\nThere\u2019s concern that without Kurdish forces in northern Syria, ISIS could again gain a foothold there.\n\nRepublican lawmakers and humanitarian groups alike have criticized Trump\u2019s decision to abandon the Kurds, warning that a Turkish offensive in Syria could imperil hundreds of thousands of civilians. The White House\u2019s announcement that it would pull troops out of Syria reportedly even caught top-level national security officials by surprise, according to Politico.\n\nThe International Rescue Committee said it was worried that a Turkish offensive could jeopardize necessary humanitarian services in the region. \u201cA military offensive could displace 300,000 people and disrupt life-saving humanitarian services, including the IRCs,\u201d the organization said in a statement.\n\nTrump\u2019s pulling troops from northern Syria isn\u2019t the first time the U.S. has hung the Kurds out to dry. Over the last century, the United States has turned its back on the Kurds at least eight times, according to The Intercept.\n\nTrump, for his part, issued a statement Wednesday as Turkey launched its attack, which did not explicitly condemn them.\n\n\u201cThe United States does not endorse this attack and has made clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea,\u201d the White House statement said. \u201cTurkey has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place \u2014 and we will hold them to this commitment.\u201d\n\nJust before Turkey launched its attack on the Kurds Wednesday, there were reports that the remnants of an ISIS militia launched an attack on the Syrian city of Raqqa, which was once considered the caliphate\u2019s capital.", "description": "President Erdo\u011fan launched airstrikes and sent in troops after Trump pulled U.S. forces from the region, abandoning a key ally in the fight against ISIS.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9e4aa6df2b7c000ad4657b/lede/1570655030009-SFV_SEG4708_TURKEY_INVADES_SYRIA00_00_29_13Still004.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
