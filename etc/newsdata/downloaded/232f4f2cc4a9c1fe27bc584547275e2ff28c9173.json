You\u2019re sending mass amounts of messaging to this person to either shut up, disappear, or it could also be perceived as, Kill yourself.\u201d\n\nSo naturally, Gomez\u2019s post ignited all sorts of drama, with fans accusing her of being disloyal and cozying up to the person on the top of Swift\u2019s blacklist.\n\nWHY IS SELENA PROMOTING SKIMS WHICH IS K*M KARDASHIAN\u2019S BRAND \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc80 pic.twitter.com/sbF45WhSZB \u2014 Hana \ud83e\udd75 (@MissAmericHANA) October 28, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s where things get interesting: Gomez seemingly pulled a Swift and promptly removed herself from the narrative, deleting the pro-Kardashian post hours later.\n\nShe then almost immediately made it clear where her allegiances lie by shouting out Swift in an appreciation post on Instagram Stories.\n\n\u201cMy ride or die. I would die for this one,\u201d the Disney Channel alum wrote alongside a candid photo of herself and the singer. \u201cThank you for forever being by my side. You have taught me so much, walked through all of this with me, STAYED and you remind me to be a better, human being. I\u2019m on your side for life.\u201d\n\nInstagram\n\nKardashian has yet to respond to Gomez\u2019s now-deleted post \u2015 risking a famous friendship over a product is basically the best endorsement one could ask for \u2015 but we\u2019re sure she appreciated the short-lived promo.\n\nAnd things appear to be all good lately between Gomez and Swift, who gushed over Gomez\u2019s new single in an interview that aired Friday, describing it as \u201cthe best thing she\u2019s done.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is such a revelation because now she\u2019s making her best stuff,\u201d Swift said of her friend. \u201cI am 100 percent convinced this is the best thing she\u2019s done so far. Just from my perspective as her friend, I\u2019ve just never been more proud. The things that she\u2019s overcome, the situations that she\u2019s risen above.\u201d", "description": "The singer called Swift her \"ride or die\" after deleting a post in support of the reality TV star.", "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db84c7d210000283bad43da.png?cache=2bp7kyutcg&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
