When she pulled over and opened the hood, she found dry grass and hundreds of walnuts put there by squirrels.\n\n\"We have never seen anything like that, and neither did our auto mechanic,\" Persic told Insider in a Facebook message. \"The squirrels really worked hard to collect that many walnuts!\"\n\nThe Persics took the car to a nearby auto shop, where mechanics cleaned out half a trashcan's worth of walnuts from the truck's engine area.\n\n\"My wife uses her car for work, and just drove it on Friday last week. So it only sat without running for the weekend,\" Persic told Insider. \"They were busy!\"\n\nRead more: Meet the winner of this year's Fat Bear Week in Alaska \u2014 and the competitors she beat\n\nWhile there was no extensive damage to the truck, the squirrels did chew through an electrical cord under the hood that needed to be repaired.\n\nWalnuts in the hood of the car. Courtesy of Chris Persic\n\nPersic told Insider that none of his neighbors have had any issues with walnuts in their cars. But he and his family have a walnut tree directly above their driveway, which makes the car a convenient location for squirrel storage.\n\n\"We have a ton of squirrels and chipmunks around our house. You can literally hear them when you walk outside,\" he said. \"Pretty sure our yard is the home-base for their squirrel army.\"\n\nTheir next move is to start parking the car in the garage \u2014 it's a place the squirrels hopefully can't reach. Persic said they're also going to check under the hood a little more often.", "description": "Chris Persic, of Franklin Park, Pennsylvania, posted about the ordeal on Facebook, saying he and his wife, Holly, discovered hundreds of walnuts.", "authors": ["Kelly Mclaughlin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9f8ae4695b5877227df0cb?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
