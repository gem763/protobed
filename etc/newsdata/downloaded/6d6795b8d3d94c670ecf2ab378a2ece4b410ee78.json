I love a good hero sandwich with melty cheese. (Yum!)\u201d\n\nIs there one dish you won\u2019t cook? \u201cVeal kidneys\u2014I\u2019ve never liked them, so it\u2019s just something I would never cook.\u201d\n\nAll-time favorite spice. \u201cThe spice I use the most is definitely piment d\u2019espelette, which is a special paprika from the south of France. My other favorite is pimenton de la Vera, a Spanish smoked paprika. This one reminds me of my grandmother\u2019s cooking, so it\u2019s nostalgic for me.\u201d\n\nWhat is your favorite music to listen to while you cook? \u201cI love to listen to Latin music in the kitchen. It always gives me energy and makes me want to dance!\u201d\n\nDid you grow up cooking as a child? \u201cI always watched both my grandmothers cook when I was young, but I mostly just watched. I didn\u2019t really start cooking until I started culinary school at age 15.\u201d\n\nWhat cookbook is your go-to resource for inspiration? \u201cI don\u2019t usually look to cookbooks as often for inspiration, but I\u2019m obsessed with culinary magazines. I draw a lot of inspiration from Thuri\u00e8s Gastronomie Magazine and Yam Magazine, which are both very famous in France.\u201d\n\nAfter all these years working in restaurants, do you still enjoy going out to eat? \u201cYes! I love to go out and enjoy different types of cuisines and service that I\u2019m not as familiar with.\u201d\n\nIs there one chef you\u2019d like to cook with? \u201cThis might be ambitious, but I would love to cook with Thomas Keller here in the U.S., and \u00c9ric Fr\u00e9chon in France. I\u2019m so inspired by their work.\u201d\n\nName the all-time best cooking show. \u201cDefinitely Parts Unknown, it was such an amazing discovery of the world and culture through the lens of food.\u201d\n\nWhat is the one tool that you always make sure to pack when you\u2019re traveling for business? \u201cMy two must haves anytime I travel for work is a good sharp chef\u2019s knife and a paring knife.\u201d\n\nLincoln Carson is the executive chef of New York\u2019s Le Coq Rico.\n\nInterview has been condensed and edited.", "description": "The executive chef of New York\u2019s Le Coq Rico tackles our speed round of questions.", "authors": ["Noah Rothbaum", "Half Full Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567722208/190909-le-coq-rico-hero_antuuh", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
