Oracle has, however, struggled to inspire as much confidence on Wall Street over the last five years or so because of its inability to truly capitalize on the rise of cloud computing. But is now the time to buy ORCL stock heading into Q1 2020 earnings?\n\nORCL Overview\n\nOracle is a historic business-related software giant that went public in the mid-1980s after its founding in the late \u201870s. The Redwood Shores, California-based firm is still a global tech powerhouse and boasts that it is the No. 1 provider of business software, with over 430,000 customers. Oracle\u2019s growth has slowed down in recent years as companies big and small join the cloud computing revolution.\n\nIndustry giants Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) have seen their stock prices soar as they expand their cloud offerings. Google (NASDAQ: ) , IBM (NYSE: ) , and Alibaba (NYSE: ) come in behind MSFT and AMZN, while Oracle struggles to gain market share. Of course, Oracle is actively growing and trying to penetrate the cloud market and other potential growth areas.\n\nIn June, Oracle and Microsoft announced that two firms set up a \u201ccloud interoperability partnership\u201d that will allow customers to essentially use both MSFT\u2019s Azure and Oracle Cloud. Overall, there are many more details to dive into, but simply put, investors need to focus on Oracle\u2019s ability to shift its business to a more modern, cloud-focused, software-as-a-service model that has seen Salesforce (NYSE: ) and others thrive. \u201cOur high-margin Fusion and NetSuite cloud applications businesses are growing rapidly, while we downsize our low-margin legacy hardware business,\u201d Oracle CEO Safra Catz said in prepared remarks last quarter.\n\n\u201cThe net result of this shift away from commodity hardware to cloud applications was a Q4 non-GAAP operating margin of 47%, the highest we've seen in five years.\u201d\n\nQ1 Outlook & Beyond\n\nLooking ahead, Oracle\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2020 revenue is projected to pop 0.96% to reach $9.29 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. This would roughly matched Q4\u2019s 1% growth, which topped our estimates, and marked the second straight quarter of revenue growth after two straight periods of declines.\n\nORCL\u2019s full-year fiscal 2020 revenue is projected to jump 2.3% to reach $40.43 billion. The firm\u2019s full-year growth would easily top 2019\u2019s roughly flat movement but come in below 2018\u2019s 4.2% expansion. Peeking further down the road, the company\u2019s fiscal 2021 revenue is projected to jump 2.9% above our current-year projection to reach $41.60 billion.\n\nAt the bottom end of the income statement, ORCL\u2019s adjusted Q1 earnings are projected to surge 14% to hit $0.81 per share. This would mark a slowdown from last quarter\u2019s 23% EPS growth, which did easily top our estimates.\n\nThe company\u2019s full-year EPS figure is then projected to pop 10.8%, with 2021 expected to come in 10% above our 2020 estimate. We should also note that ORCL almost always tops our quarterly earnings estimates.\n\nBottom Line\n\nOracle is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now that sports a \u201cB\u201d grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. We can also see that ORCL is trading at a huge discount compared to its industry\u2019s average at the moment, as it has for the past decade. More importantly, the company has traded as high as 17X forward 12-months Zacks earnings estimates in the last year (14.8X right now).\n\nOracle also looks as though it is poised to post some solid top and bottom-line growth over the next serval years. ORCL also currently pays an annualized dividend of $0.96 per share, with a 1.81% yield. This rests above the 10-year U.S. Treasury note\u2019s 1.64% yield (as of late afternoon Sept. 9), which makes Oracle stock pretty attractive all on its own\u2014especially considering that the yield is not artificially inflated due to a massive selloff. Plus, ORCL returns a ton of value to shareholders through buybacks, reportedly coming in only second to Apple (NASDAQ: ) last year.\n\nInvestors need to pay close attention to any and all cloud updates. And playing a stock around earnings always presents danger since no one ever knows how Wall Street will react. Those feeling a bit risky might scoop up some shares beforehand, while others might want to consider buying if ORCL provides upbeat guidance.\n\nIn the end, Oracle is a dividend-paying tech giant that looks stable amid our current global economic uncertainty. With this in mind, there are many worse places to put some money at the moment.\n\nOracle is set to release its Q1 fiscal 2020 results after the closing bell on Thursday, September 12.\n\nToday's Best Stocks from Zacks\n\n\n\nWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market-beating strategies?
