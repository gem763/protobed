New models say as many as 300 million people are at risk\n\nA revamped model, which more accurately takes into account land elevation using satellite readings and artificial intelligence, portends that swaths of countries like Vietnam and India will be under water by midcentury.\n\nAccording to researchers, the new estimates came as a shock even for them, given their dramatic difference from previous tallies.\n\n'These assessments show the potential of climate change to reshape cities, economies, coastlines and entire global regions within our lifetimes,' Scott Kulp, the lead author of the study and a senior scientist at Climate Central told The Guardian.\n\nAt-risk areas include large portions of heavily populated cities like Mumbai, which is home to more than 18 million people and could be almost entirely underwater in the next 30 years.\n\nModels show the worst effects could be seen across Asia where countries like India saw a sevenfold increase in the number of people set to be affected by annual floods, and China which saw a threefold increase.\n\nThe threat isn't reduced to Asia, however. In the UK, 3.5 million people could be at risk of flooding by 2050 according to their estimates.\n\nThe US wasn't among the most affected areas according to the researchers, but previous estimates have shown that dozens of cities across the country's coastal regions could soon be submerged, especially in states like New Jersey and Florida.\n\nAbove is a map that shows the relative increase in people affected compared to previous estimates using NASA data\n\nBoth Jakarta and Bangkok are also set to be affected by rising tides. Given how densely populated those cities are, the rise could displace millions\n\nFlooding during Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey is shown above, from 2012\n\nWhile the projection is significantly worse than previous models, researchers note that the disconcerting results may still get worse.\n\nAccording to them, models are dependent on an increasingly volatile Antarctic ice sheets which continues to hemorrhage ice into the sea.\n\nScientists say that if conditions there worsen, as many as 640 million people could be threatened by rising tides by 2100.\n\nThe estimates are also based on countries keeping stride with emission reductions outlined by the Paris Agreement - benchmarks which have continually gone unmet.\n\nLikewise, estimates of the financial impact could also be much greater than previously thought.\n\nAs noted by The Guardian, World Bank data that projected the cost of climate change globally to be about $1 trillion per year were based on former models.", "description": "According to a paper published in Nature Communications on Tuesday, new models show that 300 million are currently living on land that will flood at least once a year by 2050.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/22/14414268-0-image-a-6_1572389618832.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
