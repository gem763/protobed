The adorable Sanrio character, Rilakkuma, seems like the worst possible candidate for Halloween high-jinks\u2026 how could such a cute little bear ever scare anyone?\n\nWell, the sweet bear Rilakkuma and his adorable friend Korilakkuma, have been transformed into terrifying pumpkin headed beasts for Halloween and autumn.\n\nThese creepy wagashi are made of nerikiri, a type of traditional Japanese sweet which is made using a white bean paste and mochi dough. It can be easily colored, moulded and carved into various shapes, so it is often used to create aesthetically pleasing and impressive confections.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the exterior though, the interior hides a delicious and seasonally apt secret. Rilakkuma\u2019s insides are made of pumpkin pudding flavored sweet bean paste, and Korilakkuma\u2019s bean paste innards are flavored like maple syrup.\n\nIf you can bear to seek out these creepy confections, they can be currently found in Lawson convenience stores for 280 yen.\n\nSource: @press\n\nRead more stories from grape Japan.\n\n-- Kyoto Yakitori Restaurant \u201cKazu\u201d Gets Michelin\u2019s Coveted \u2018Bib Gourmand\u2019 Rating\n\n-- Japan\u2019s Iconic Creepy Arcade \u201cAnata no Warehouse\u201d Is Closing\n\n-- Take a Break From The Cup with Otterly Adorable Rugby Players at Hakkeijima Sea Paradise\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://grapee.jp/en/\n\n\u00a9 grape Japan", "description": "Sweets and Halloween go hand in hand, and the month of the terrifying, treat-demanding holiday has finally crept up on us.
