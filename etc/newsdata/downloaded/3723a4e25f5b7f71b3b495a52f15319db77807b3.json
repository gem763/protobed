But they will crowd out the private sector and afford the Federal Reserve flexibility in terms of size and time frames, with latitude to adjust purchase amounts each month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe motivations are obvious \u2013 to continue stimulating the US capital base and to \"clean house\" after February and March\u2019s messy and corrosive emergency repo operations, which were feared to be triggers for a broader market collapse.\n\nGlobal yields have bounced off their early October lows and the relatively steady hard data in the US and talk of fiscal stimulus in the European Union are additional factors supporting a drift higher in yields.\n\nFurther evidence that risk-on is in play can be seen via the steepening of the US VIX (Volatility) curve, with near-term VIX futures relaxed while early 2020 futures increased over the past month.\n\nTraditionally the VIX futures curve steepens, with implied volatility falling across maturities. Over the past few weeks, there has been an unusual steepening, with VIX futures expiring in early 2020 rising, despite short-dated futures falling.\n\nPut simply, while the market expects less volatility in the fourth quarter than it did a month ago, it expects more volatility in early 2020.\n\nRisk appetite\n\nWith renewed optimism on Brexit progress and an easing of the US-Sino trade fracas, risk appetite recovered sharply in October. Cross-asset risk appetites have caused the greenback to hold relatively strongly, the flagship S &P 500 and Nasdaq bourses to drift higher and US treasuries to survive the down-forces of the August quantitative tightening.\n\nAll said, classic bull rallies require the momentum of a bull herd. Despite the cronyism and polarisation of Donald Trump, nothing has interfered with the continued velocity of the risk-on Trumponics trade, which began in November 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only is President Trump near assured of winning November 2020, it is increasingly likely he will soon seek to repeal the 22nd Amendment to the United States Constitution, which limits the presidency to two terms.\n\nThrough an accepted risk modulation lens, the probability of capital impairment is not only seen by pulling out of active risk assets (such as equities) and moving to cash but \u2013 as was the case in 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016 and up to today \u2013 missing the potentially five to nine more years of the Trumponics bull run.\n\nCrony capitalism and Trump\u2019s deplorable political corruption may be gutting global democratic institutions as we know them, but in the callous world of markets, bull's eye performances are found in the numbers and not the ideals.\n\nStirling Larkin is chief investment officer of Australian Standfirst (www.australianstandfirst.com).", "description": "Developments of the past two months reinforce that we're likely to witness a classic bull rally leading into US presidential elections in November 2020.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6444%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c6a72007761b8bd66bc95f1bff2bd3c5d361ccd7", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
