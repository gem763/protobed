The star performer has been the Asia division and, in particular, exports of the flagship brand Penfolds to China. Asian profits were up 43 per cent to $294 million in 2018-19.\n\nBut the Australasian arm has also been hitting its straps, and lifted profits by 15 per cent to $156 million, with profit margins of 26 per cent \u2013 the second best across the four main geographic regions of Asia, Australasia, the Americas and Europe.\n\nMr Neilson said the aim was to reach a market share in Australia of 25 per cent.\n\nThe one big focus is \u2013 how do we bring new people into the wine category? \u2014 Peter Neilson, Treasury Wine Estates\n\n\"We've laid out a roadmap of where and how we'll get there,'' he said. \"We're on track with the roadmap.\"\n\nPart of it involves working closer with big retailers on forward planning with clear financial outcomes that ''deliver against both our and their financial plans''.\n\nMr Neilson said it was a privilege to have such historic brands as Penfolds and Seppelt in the portfolio, but a substantial part of the growth was coming from young brands such as Squealing Pig and 19 Crimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The one big focus is \u2013 how do we bring new people into the wine category?'' he said.\n\nTreasury has also been a pioneer in driving the wine-in-a-can category. It has about 60 per cent share of an overall segment worth about $8 million in Australia, which Mr Neilson said was projected to grow to about $30 million within five years.\n\nThe younger demographic is responding to the convenience offered by wine-in-a-can, which has largely taken off through sparkling wine varieties, which have had a much better reception than traditional table wine varieties.\n\nThe smaller format product meant people didn't have to open an entire bottle of sparkling wine.\n\n\"We think we've got the proposition right and the format right,'' Mr Neilson said.\n\nThe spotlight is often on the bigger brands such as Penfolds and Wolf Blass, but Seppelt, with a history stretching to 1851, is being revitalised too.\n\n\"Seppelt is a bit of an uncut diamond for us,'' Mr Neilson said.\n\nIt is at the forefront of an old and new approach. A new Seppelt prosecco in a can will be prominent over the next few weeks at Melbourne's spring racing carnival, including the Melbourne Cup.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Neilson, who became managing director of Treasury's Australia and New Zealand business 15 months ago, said trials were also under way for a Yellowglen wine-in-a-can.\n\nHe said Treasury was being careful to still preserve the heritage of the Seppelt brand, but also stretch it to a new, younger audience. \"I think you can have a balance,'' he said.\n\nSeppelt has been a commercial partner of the Victorian Racing Club for 41 years, underlining the long history of the Treasury brands.\n\nMr Neilson, who joined the company in 2012 after stints with Diageo, Mars Confectionery and Reebok, said he was conscious that the wine brands he oversees have had dozens of custodians in the past.\n\nHe intends to keep adding extra polish. \"Leave it in a better place than you find it,'' he said.", "description": "Australasian boss Peter Neilson says new products and formats are part of what's driving an expansion to 22 per cent market share in the fiercely competitive Australian market.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2889%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_323%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/360947e74b8ee05091539aa572d8ea1135527a46", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
