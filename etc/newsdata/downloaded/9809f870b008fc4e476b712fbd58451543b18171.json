All the research says people don\u2019t switch political affiliations, even when they disagree with their party on key issues. It\u2019s one of the inexorable truths of American partisanship.\n\n\u201cYour religious and political identity is given to you at birth, right?\u201d Rouda, 57, told me recently, recounting his upbringing in a conservative, Christian household. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody holds their hand up and says at 6, 7 or 8 years old, \u2018Hey, Mom and Dad, I\u2019m not feeling Christian or Republican. I\u2019m thinking about making a switch.\u2019 And that was true for me as well.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nUntil one day it wasn\u2019t true any longer.\n\nIn 2017, Rouda, a one-time Reagan and Bush voter who had quietly severed his Republican ties to identify as an independent, made the rarest of transformations. He registered as a Democrat with the express purpose of running against a 15-term Republican congressman in Orange County, a place famous as a redoubt of the California GOP. He won by 7 points.\n\nRouda won because Orange County has changed dramatically, too. What was once an 18-point Republican advantage in voter registration just a decade ago evaporated, permitting the unthinkable to happen in 2016 when Hillary Clinton won the county by nearly 5 points, becoming the first Democratic presidential nominee to win here since 1936.\n\nAnd then last year, Rouda and three other Democrats swept the congressional races, eradicating the GOP from the electoral map in a place that Ronald Reagan once described as the place \u201cwhere good Republicans go to die.\u201d Democrats\u2019 blue wave in 2018 was more like a blue tsunami in this affluent and scenic sanctuary nestled between the urban sprawls of Los Angeles and San Diego.\n\nThe mortification of the GOP on its home turf came due to two primary factors: an influx of young and Latino voters who have diluted the power of the white conservatives who long defined the county, and a split inside the Republican party itself, driven by its nominal leader, President Donald Trump. Rouda defeated longtime Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) in no small part because of the incumbent\u2019s close ties to Trump and his longtime support of the Vladimir Putin regime in Russia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that Orange County\u2019s values have changed; it\u2019s that the Republican party\u2019s values have changed. And they\u2019ve completely lost touch with reality and the vast majority of voters,\u201d Rouda told me as he sipped a Starbucks iced latte with soy milk just 15 miles from Richard Nixon\u2019s \u201cWestern White House.\u201d\n\nWhile the demographic trends show no hint of weakening, it\u2019s an open question whether those disaffected Republicans are, like Rouda, permanently done with the GOP\u2014or whether they can be coaxed back in a post-Trump world. There is a fierce battle already underway, from the marble halls of the Capitol to the beaches of southern California, to decide Orange County\u2019s fate\u2014and, in turn, that of the House majority post-2020.\n\nRecently, I spent time in Rouda\u2019s district\u2014which he gleefully touts as the \u201cmost beautiful congressional district in the country\u201d\u2014and Orange County\u2019s three other congressional districts. On the day I shadowed Rouda, he was dressed almost as if we were walking in a hallway inside the Capitol\u2014navy blue suit and leather shoes, the lack of necktie the only concession to the balmy weather. More than once during the day, the kind of Orange County voter that Reagan would have recognized\u2014white retirees walking their dogs on the beach\u2014approached Rouda. Some just wanted to shake his hand. Others simply shouted, \u201cI voted for you!\u201d\n\nA constituent recognizes and greets Rep. Harley Rouda as he walks through his district in Laguna Beach. | Nancy Pastor for Politico Magazine\n\nPoliticians in Orange County, like in many American suburbs, are becoming less dependent on these older white voters for their coalition. Orange County, in a very short time, has become younger and less white\u2014and when paired with Trump\u2019s election in 2016, that shift cemented Orange County\u2019s status as ground zero for Republicans\u2019 struggle to attract young voters, moderates and minorities, especially in suburban America.\n\n\u201cSince Donald Trump came into the picture, we have seen this huge uprising,\u201d Ada Brice\u00f1o, who chairs the Orange County Democratic Party, told me.\n\nBut there is another salient truth about that might prove just as consequential in 2020: Voters who left the Republican party in the last cycle didn\u2019t register as Democrats; they overwhelmingly became independents. In short, they were up for grabs in 2018 and they\u2019re still up for grabs a year later.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons that despite positioning himself as a fiscally conservative moderate in an increasingly progressive Democratic party, Rouda will face a difficult race in 2020 to keep his job. A recent poll commissioned by a Republican super PAC, for example, shows a neck-and-neck race between Rouda and his presumed GOP opponent. He\u2019s not alone; all four lawmakers who represent parts of Orange County\u2014Rouda, Gil Cisneros, Katie Porter and Mike Levin\u2014are at the top of Republicans\u2019 list of lawmakers they consider most vulnerable as the GOP tries to wrest back control of the House.\n\nAs unpopular as Trump is here, Democrats worry they could blow it. As the party\u2019s loudest voices embrace progressive agenda items like Medicare for All and tuition-free college, the four freshman lawmakers who edged out Republican opponents, in part by portraying themselves as moderates who would stand up to their own party when necessary, will have to convince crossover voters that they\u2019ve been true to their word. That tightrope will become even more difficult to walk as the House Democrats, emboldened by the latest allegations involving Ukraine, march toward impeaching the president.\n\nIn October 2018, former Vice President Joe Biden (center) campaigns with California congressional candidates including Orange County Democratic challengers Harley Rouda (far left), Katie Porter (second from left) and Gil Cisneros (far right). | Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy to win this seat,\u201d Levin warned sternly at a recent town hall in the beachside city of Del Mar. \u201cAnd it won\u2019t be easy to hold this seat.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nRouda\u2019s break-up with the party he had grown up in didn\u2019t happen overnight.\n\nThe first breach came in the late 1990s. He blamed then-Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Georgia) for ushering in a new era of conservatism that Rouda felt was \u201cnot recognizable\u201d to Reagan\u2019s GOP\u2014in particular, its drift away from fiscal responsibility and compassionate immigration policies, and the party\u2019s preoccupation with social issues like same-sex marriage. (Gingrich, no fan of Rouda\u2019s either, has already endorsed Rouda\u2019s opponent, Michelle Steel. Steel was not available for an interview.) At first, he simply described himself as an independent.\n\n\u201cUp until 1997, you had a Republican party that believed in environmental stewardship, believed in the right of everyone to vote, believed in reducing deficits,\u201d Rouda said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s certainly not the case now. At best, all of those issues are on the backburner if not off the stovetop altogether.\u201d\n\nA frustrated Rouda then threw his hands up.\n\n\u201cI mean, does anybody really think Ronald Reagan could get elected [today]?\u201d he said. \u201cI liked the way he saw the city on the hill and how he talked about everyone in our country having a fair economic opportunity, that immigration is a positive thing.\u201d\n\nAround the same time that he contemplated leaving the GOP altogether, he married Kaira Sturdivant, a liberal Democrat who supported Jimmy Carter. They sparred occasionally over politics, but in the end, Rouda joked: \u201cApparently she had more influence on me than I had on her.\u201d\n\nHe voted for George W. Bush in 2000\u2014but that was the last time he voted for a Republican at the top of the ticket. Bush\u2019s invasion of Iraq in 2003 angered Rouda. \u201c[That] kind of sealed the deal. Like, I\u2019m done with this party,\u201d he said.\n\nRouda moved to Orange County from Ohio in 2007, managing his real estate law practice from one of the priciest zip codes in all of California. Still, he continued donating to Republican candidates even after leaving the GOP. In 2016, he contributed $1,000 to then-Ohio Governor John Kasich\u2019s presidential campaign, citing his friendship with Kasich and his desire to see Trump defeated in the GOP primary. When Kasich inevitably dropped out, Rouda was faced with a choice between Trump and Clinton. He lamented that the 2016 election \u201calmost came down to who you disliked more.\u201d He chose Clinton and, in 2017, registered as a Democrat for the first time in his life. Shortly thereafter, he announced his candidacy to take on Rohrabacher.\n\nSome progressives took issue with Rouda\u2019s past as a Republican. But they also saw it as a boon\u2014an opportunity to appeal to conservatives disaffected with Trump in a district that Clinton won by nearly 5 points (39,000 votes) in 2016. Rouda\u2019s seven-point victory over Rohrabacher validated their instincts.\n\nBoth political parties are trying to figure out whether political shapeshifters like Rouda are outliers\u2014or, if they\u2019re bellwethers for a more dramatic shift to come.\n\n\n\n***\n\nThe last time Orange County recorded a Democratic voter registration advantage was Oct. 13, 1978\u2014a brief response to the Watergate scandal, as Republicans dominated for decades before. Mike Levin was born seven days later. It took 41 years for Democrats to re-gain that advantage.\n\nEven before Rouda arrived here, Levin \u2014 who represents southern Orange County and parts of San Diego County \u2014 could see the trend from his perch atop the Orange County Democratic party, which he ran in 2006 and 2007. At the time, Republicans had an 18-point advantage over Democrats in voter registration.\n\nIn the 12 years since he ran the local Democratic party, the demographics in Orange County have undergone sweeping changes. Latino voters make up 21 percent of Orange County\u2019s electorate, up more than a third since 2016 as more have gained American citizenship. Hispanic voter turnout sharply increased, in what was likely a response to Trump\u2019s hardline immigration rhetoric. Clinton\u2019s 2016 victory here shocked Republicans\u2014and just two years later, the county\u2019s GOP lawmakers were wiped out completely.\n\n\u201cThe Asian population is growing. The Latino population is growing. And with that demographic change, you also see a change in the way people vote,\u201d said Gil Cisneros, 48, a lifelong resident of Orange County who, like Rouda is also a former Republican.\n\nRep. Gil Cisneros at a cafe in his district in Buena Park, CA. | Nancy Pastor for Politico Magazine\n\nCisneros, whose district also includes parts of Los Angeles County and San Bernardino County, voted for Ross Perot in the 1990s and John McCain in 2008 but turned away from the Republican party shortly after that election, when he watched fringe voices push racist conspiracy theories about whether Barack Obama was a Muslim who was born in Kenya.\n\n\u201cA lot of racist tendencies were coming out. And it just wasn\u2019t something that I wanted to be associated with,\u201d Cisneros told me defiantly over coffee in Buena Park. \u201cBy 2008, you could really see the tides moving. The direction the Republican party was moving in was not the Republican Party that it was 20 years ago.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have also seen gains here among voters ages 18 to 34. In 2002, 42 percent of them were registered Republicans, compared to 29 percent for Democrats. This year, 38 percent of those voters are registered as Democrats, and just 20 percent as Republicans. The share of independent voters also sharply increased during that same time period, from 22 percent to 42 percent.\n\nWhile the Latino boom in Orange County has helped Democrats, the surge of Asian-Americans has been less conclusive. While Asian-American share of the electorate has ballooned to 16 percent, registration numbers show that 29 percent are Republicans and 30 percent are Democrats. Forty-one percent are registered with neither party.\n\nToday, Orange County has the third-largest Asian-American population in the country, and it\u2019s particularly visible in Irvine, where Katie Porter\u2019s district falls. Asian-American voters tend to be more conservative, but some analysts have pointed to Trump\u2019s immigration rhetoric as the key reason why turnout in favor of Democrats has increased for this key group.\n\nTwo of the likely GOP nominees in Orange County\u2019s four congressional districts are Asian-American women. Cisneros will have a rematch in 2020 against his 2018 GOP opponent, Young Kim, a Korean-born businesswoman and former state legislator; Rouda will likely face off against Steel, a county supervisor who was also born in South Korea.\n\nSteel, Rouda\u2019s opponent, is largely aligned with Trump, which the Rouda campaign plans to drill into voters\u2019 minds here. She co-chairs his presidential advisory commission on Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders. Steel was also the only elected official to greet the president when Air Force One landed at Los Angeles International Airport last March, his first official visit to California.\n\nRep. Harley Rouda | Nancy Pastor for Politico Magazine\n\nKim, too, supports the president\u2019s policies, telling me that Trump deserves credit for the strength of the U.S. economy. She has praised him for slashing federal regulations and signing a sweeping tax-overhaul bill into law\u2014one that many California Republicans actually opposed in part because it capped the state and local tax deduction at $10,000.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that these economic policies are woefully unpopular, these environmental policies are woefully unpopular, the immigration policies are woefully unpopular,\u201d Levin added. \u201cHence the president\u2019s approval here is in the 30s.\u201d\n\n\u201cCalifornia Republicans are not like Alabama and Mississippi Republicans. They tend to be a little bit more liberal when it comes to social issues,\u201d Cisneros said.\n\nRouda cited one of the key local Orange County issues \u2014 the threat of climate change \u2014 as one of the reasons he left the GOP. The Trump administration has rolled back several Obama-era emissions and air-quality standards\u2014part of what Levin said is the president waging a \u201cpolicy war on the state of California\u201d with its efforts to restrict the state\u2019s more progressive environmental and immigration standards. He believes it\u2019s helping to drive voters here away from the GOP.\n\n\u201cWe care about clean air, clean water, clean beaches. Because we live here. Because we see the impact of climate change,\u201d Levin said, pointing to the beach 50 feet behind him as we sat on a picnic table. \u201cBecause we understand what it\u2019s like when you don\u2019t have those strict air quality requirements because we grew up here at a time when we had far worse emission standards.\u201d\n\nRandall Avila, the Orange County Republican party\u2019s executive director, agrees with Democrats on one thing: Trump has driven suburban Republicans away. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely a two-sided coin,\u201d Avila said. \u201cBut his presidency and the passion on one side or another has accelerated that process.\u201d\n\nTo reclaim its voter registration advantage, Avila said his organization will focus on Republicans who left the party to become independents. Some Orange County residents who left the GOP actually support the president, Avila said, and only did so in protest of the establishment wing of the party.\n\nBut Republicans who jumped ship over their dissatisfaction with Trump pose the biggest challenge for Avila, who said he plans to focus on local economic issues\u2014rather than the beltway-driven Trump controversies that might push Republicans away from the president\u2014in order to win them back.\n\n\n\n***\n\nRouda\u2019s own party has dubbed him a so-called \u201cfrontliner,\u201d a list of several lawmakers whom the national party says are the most vulnerable in 2020. The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), too, has Rouda near the top of its list, and the GOP still has a seven-point voter registration advantage in Rouda\u2019s district, which includes more conservative pockets like Newport Beach.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s argument to Rouda\u2019s constituents is simple: You were swindled. The NRCC has already dinged him for supporting an impeachment inquiry into the president, and they\u2019ve referred to Rouda as a \u201cSocialist Democrat.\u201d Moreover, Republicans say Rouda\u2019s victory in 2018 was a fluke because Rohrabacher, notoriously apologetic for the Putin regime, was an unpopular and flawed incumbent. Translation: A level-headed Republican would fare better.\n\nRep. Gil Cisneros | Nancy Pastor for Politico Magazine\n\nThe \u201csocialist\u201d moniker won\u2019t go away any time soon. Republicans are seeking to tie Democratic lawmakers to members of the so-called progressive \u201csquad\u201d like Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). In particular, they\u2019ve seized on Omar\u2019s recent anti-Semitic comments that have sparked intense backlash among members of her own party, including Democratic leaders and frontliners.\n\n\u201cMost voters also know that the \u2018squad\u2019 is not the leadership of the Democratic party. That may play well with the Republican base, but they\u2019re not voting for us anyway,\u201d Rouda said. \u201cWe got the majority back not by keeping blue seats blue; we got the majority by flipping red seats blue. And the people who did that are moderates\u2014left-leaning moderates.\u201d\n\nBut if one of the more progressive presidential candidates like Sen. Bernie Sanders or Sen. Elizabeth Warren emerges as the party\u2019s 2020 nominee, it could be more difficult for vulnerable lawmakers like Rouda to distinguish themselves from the party\u2019s left flank. Perhaps even more problematic, Democrats like Rouda will have a tougher time arguing for fiscal responsibility when the top of the Democratic ticket is calling for Medicare for All and tuition-free public colleges.\n\nBoth Rouda and Levin made impassioned pleas for fiscal responsibility. Rouda told me that Californians are over-taxed at the local, state and federal level; Levin brought up the national debt unprompted. Indeed, they believe that fiscal conservatism can help them continue to peel away Republicans who are disenchanted with the way Trump has presided over a runaway deficit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ballooning our deficit and our debt, which I care very deeply about\u2014not all Democrats do. I do,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a proponent of modern monetary theory. I am a proponent of fiscal responsibility and investment, and understanding the difference between an investment and a cost.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are particularly keen on portraying Porter\u2014who represents Irvine, Calif., and defeated incumbent GOP Rep. Mimi Walters last year\u2014as a liberal Democrat who ran as a centrist. Porter has become somewhat of a progressive hero for her relentless questioning of witnesses at House Financial Services Committee hearings, including a viral grilling of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon over employee compensation. She has leaned heavily into that persona, joking at a recent town hall that Dimon has become her \u201cpen pal.\u201d\n\nAvila, who runs the Orange County GOP, said both his organization as well as the national party apparatus plan to highlight that apparent dissonance, calling Porter a \u201cnational sensation\u201d among progressives and citing her appearances on television shows like Bill Maher\u2019s HBO program.\n\n\u201cWhile she\u2019s attracted a lot of attention through online small donations from Democrats across the country, it\u2019s putting her in a very awkward position here in Orange County with her constituents. She campaigned as a moderate,\u201d Avila said. \u201cAnd she said she was going to be a moderate voice in Congress, but she\u2019s outing herself and giving us a lot of material to work with to show that she is very much far-left.\u201d\n\nRepublicans also see a prime pickup opportunity in Cisneros\u2019 district, which will feature a rematch of his 2018 contest against Kim. She is already seeking to tie Cisneros to Ocasio-Cortez, noting that he is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n\nA close-up of Rep. Harley Rouda's congressional lapel pin. | Nancy Pastor for Politico Magazine\n\n\u201cHe said he would try to be a moderate person, yet he goes on to join the Progressive Caucus, whose agenda and policies are leaning further and further to the left,\u201d Kim said in an interview. \u201cAnd he votes with the likes of Progressive Caucus members like AOC over 90 percent of the time. So I don\u2019t know what he has accomplished so far. I would like to see it.\u201d\n\nStill, Cisneros plans to highlight the national debt in order to woo Republicans disaffected with Trump.\n\n\u201cThis is something that we Democrats need to communicate and that we need to do a better job and let people know that we are the party of fiscal responsibility, we are the party where the economy has thrived under us, and this is the party where workers have also had success and where they thrive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re the party of the American worker.\u201d\n\nKim described herself as an \u201cindependent voice\u201d and noted that while Republican registration has declined in Orange County, the number of self-described independents has grown. That pool of voters will be critical for all candidates in the county\u2019s four congressional districts in 2020.\n\nWhile she supports the president, she tipped her hat to the steep decline in GOP registration by acknowledging that Trump\u2019s personal behavior often turns voters off.\n\n\u201cPeople can say whatever they want to say about our president. I think they are talking about his style of speaking, his rhetoric, his attitude or whatever,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThey may not like him as a person, but I hear that they do appreciate the policies that have made our economy really stronger.\u201d\n\nBut for the Democrats now commanding the electoral high ground in Orange County, there is a belief that the disintegrating Republican party cannot reform around a single issue like the economy; there are too many other factors working against it, and most of them are exacerbated by the presence of Trump at the top of the ticket.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think Trump would get elected, and I thought he would potentially cause the demise of the Republican Party as we know it,\u201d Rouda added. \u201cI was wrong in one sense\u2014he got elected. But I may still be right in the other sense, that the Republican Party as we know it may not exist after the Trump era.\u201d\n\nCisneros concurs with his fellow ex-Republican, both of whom will be the Democrats\u2019 anchors here in 2020 as the party defends its majority.\n\n\u201cIf the [Republican] party continues to go down that route, I don\u2019t see how it could survive,\u201d Cisneros said of his former political affiliation. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t see how it could survive here in California. It\u2019s going to continue to get smaller and smaller.\u201d\n\nHe added, somewhat optimistically: \u201cI always like to think that what happens in California eventually happens throughout the rest of the country.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis article tagged under: 2020", "description": "Demographic changes and an unpopular president have remade Orange County\u2019s electoral map.
