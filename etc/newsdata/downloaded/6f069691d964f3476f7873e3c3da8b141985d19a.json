Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL 0.52% \u2019s Google both recently removed apps associated with Hong Kong\u2019s antigovernment protests from their digital stores after taking heat from Chinese officials.\n\nExecutives have to thread a needle when a company\u2019s commercial and financial interests clash with the CEO\u2019s personal values and the cultural values of an enterprise and its home country, said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a leadership expert at the Yale School of Management. \u201cOne of the rarely discussed downsides of globalization is you get caught in those crosscurrents,\u201d he said.\n\nYet CEOs are under pressure to be visible on social and political issues, evidenced in part by a statement released in August by the Business Roundtable. The group, which represents some of America\u2019s biggest companies, redefined its view on the purpose of a corporation. It said executives should make business decisions based on the interests of multiple stakeholders\u2014including employees, customers and society writ large\u2014rather than focus only on profits for investors.\n\nWhen it comes to public expression, companies set the rules.\n\nAn antigovernment protester blocked a road outside the Apple store in Hong Kong during clashes with police on Oct. 1.

Workers can raise concerns about safety and working conditions, for example, but bosses aren\u2019t covered by that protection.\n\nWhen it comes to policing speech, \u201cyou can actually be a little more stringent with manager levels and above,\u201d Mr. Smith said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the face of the company,\u201d he added. \u201cHow does the CEO say, \u2018I\u2019m saying this but it has nothing to do with my role running the company?\u2019\u201d\n\nMore companies in the past two years have started bolstering their executive contracts with an eye to social media, Mr. Smith said. They have incorporated clauses giving them more leeway to fire executives for posting something inappropriate online, including a provision saying the employer is allowed to terminate an executive if she or he does something likely to hurt the company\u2019s reputation or operations.\n\nA couple of clients have specifically laid out social-media rules in employment contracts, Mr. Smith said, in some cases specifying that executives have to run posts by a company gatekeeper.\n\nPaul Argenti, a professor of corporate communication at Dartmouth College\u2019s Tuck School of Business, said corporate leaders are in a tricky spot. \u201cAre you going to be okay when your company loses sales because of what you said?\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Argenti, in his consulting work, counsels executives to stay mum on topics that aren\u2019t core to their businesses.\n\n\u201cThe job of a CEO is not to save the world or make the world safe for democracy,\u201d he said. Corporate leaders should speak on issues that matter to their companies, like climate change for an oil company or pesticides for an agriculture business, he said. Other than that, they should stand down.\n\nRick Wartzman, a director at the Drucker Institute, an organization focused on leadership and management, sees another risk coming from the attention surrounding social-media posts. The fracas sparked by ephemeral statements can distract from more substantive questions of social responsibility, he said.\n\n\u201cWhat concerns me is whether statements, while important, become a substitute for the more meaningful work around what it means to be a responsible company and take care of all your stakeholders,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Rachel Feintzeig at rachel.feintzeig@wsj.com and Lauren Weber at lauren.weber@wsj.com", "description": "With chief executives taking vocal stands on issues like gun control, climate change and immigration, corporate managers doing business internationally are advised to think twice about sounding off on global affairs.", "authors": ["Rachel Feintzeig", "Lauren Weber", "Rachel.Feintzeig Wsj.Com", "Lauren.Weber Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-116435/social", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
