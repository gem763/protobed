MTR did not immediately give a reason for the accident.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s rail system has been a target of vandalism during recent pro democracy protests in the city with activists angry that MTR has closed stations to stop protesters gathering.\n\nTelevision footage on Tuesday morning showed hundreds of passengers trying to disembark from the derailed train. Public broadcaster RTHK said the train suddenly swayed and a door flew off before the train stopped.\n\nNearby stations were overcrowded with a backlog of trains unable to move and trains which normally run at two minute intervals were delayed to run at 12 minute intervals.\n\nShares of MTR fell 1.1% in line with the broader Hang Seng Index which was down 1%.", "description": "A rare train derailment disrupted services in Hong Kong on Tuesday, train authorities said, threatening commuter chaos during rush hour in the heart of the Asian financial hub.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430677506&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G058", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
