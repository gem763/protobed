The county clerk\u2019s office later discovered the original voter files in the trash at the election-division office,\u201d National Review wrote.\n\nMs. Hawkins is on paid administrative leave from her post as city clerk for the Detroit suburb until the trial reaches a conclusion.\n\n\u201cThe Michigan Democratic party honored Hawkins this year with the prestigious Dingell/Levin award at its annual Legacy Dinner in Detroit, and she was included in the Michigan Chronicle\u2019s \u201840 under 40\u2019 list in 2017,\u201d NRO writer Jack Crowe wrote.\n\nCiting her LinkedIn profile, NRO noted that Ms. Hawkins had served as city clerk in nearby Pontiac in 2010 when Democrat Gary Peters, now a U.S. senator, narrowly won a House race over Republican Rocky Raczkowski. During that Tea Party wave election, Mr. Peters won the 9th Congressional District seat by less than 6,500 votes, or 2.4 percentage points.\n\nMichigan attorney general Dana Nessel and secretary of state Jocelyn Benson said in a public statement regarding the charges against Ms. Hawkins that no election outcomes were affected by the purported ballot-tampering.\n\nBoth women are Democrats.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
