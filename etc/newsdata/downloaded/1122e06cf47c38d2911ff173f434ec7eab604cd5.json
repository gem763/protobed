The Indigenous Australians Minister Ken Wyatt also failed to attend the event, which is pretty ridiculous considering it\u2019s in his job description to represent the interests of Indigenous Australians on a federal level.\n\nHowever, Australians aren\u2019t just upset that he didn\u2019t attend the event. They\u2019re equally frustrated by his frankly offensive excuse for not showing up. The PM (yep, the man that\u2019s meant to represent the whole country) simply brushed off his absence by saying he \u201ccan\u2019t be in two places at once,\u201d SBS reports.\n\n\u201cMy schedule didn\u2019t permit to be there. I can\u2019t be in two places at once. I was in WA on the weekend and I was travelling back with my family from the West Australian telethon.\u201d\n\nScott Morrison opted to attend the WA Telethon and a Diamonds netball game, which would usually be an acceptable way to spend your time as the Prime Minister.\n\nHowever, Indigenous people in Australia have been forced to sit by and watch as a place of spiritual and cultural significance like Uluru has been disrespected for decades. The absolute least Scott Morrison could do was show up to the ceremony and pretend to give a shit.\n\n\u201cWell I would\u2019ve thought that the Prime Minister should\u2019ve been attending this occasion. I saw him at the basketball somewhere in Australia,\u201d Indigenous politician Pat Dodson told NITV.\u201dIf he had a real empathy with the religious and cultural foundations of the First Nations of this country he should\u2019ve been here.\u201d\n\nMany people, including Liangiari member Warren Snowdon were quick to point out that Scott Morrison likely would\u2019ve made a bigger effort if a Christian festival or event called for his attendance.\n\n\u201cThe Prime Minister should\u2019ve been at this event and showing respect for First Nations across Australia, but particularly with the Anangu, who have been generous in how they\u2019ve shared this place, and to highlight the importance of Aboriginal culture and spirituality across Australia,\u201d Dodson said.\n\nIt has taken decades for the rest of Australian society to even acknowledge that climbing Uluru is culturally insensitive and just plain wrong. And even now that the climb has finally been banned, the leaders of the country still fail to represent the best interests of the Indigenous community by attending the closing ceremony.\n\nDo better.\n\nThankfully, hundreds of #NotMyPM tweets flooded social media on Monday night, reminding us that a large chunk of society is pretty upset with the government\u2019s response to the situation.\n\nif Hillsong were custodians of Uluru, Scott Morrison woulda stayed til the end and offered all attendees a quick blowjibber for the road. #NotMyPM \u2014 Shared World Stupor (@nofuxremain) October 28, 2019\n\nThere are lots of things wrong with this government. Scomo's absence at the Uluru closing ceremony clearly indicates he has no sympathy for the first nation's peoples! Does he really deserve to be the PM of #Australia? #NotMyPM #Auspol \u2014 ????Kumar Jha (@KumarJha66) October 28, 2019\n\nMorrison on Uluru Closing Celebration : I can't be at two events at once so I went to the white one. #NotMyPM #auspol \u2014 ????Elmer Olson (@ElmerOlson) October 28, 2019", "description": "#NotMyPM was the number one trending topic on Twitter on Monday night following Scott Morrison's absence at the Uluru closing ceremony.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/20191028001429305907-original-2-1024x683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
