Six hours in, a lot of my feelings remain the same as they were when I first played Borderlands 3 at an extended preview last month. In a lot of ways it\u2019s a time capsule, in some ways embarrassingly retrograde in its sensibilities, and in other ways confident that its central draw of shooting and looting always was and will continue to be enough. Because of how little the franchise has changed, the best way to know if Borderlands 3 is for you is to boot up one of the previous games in the series and see how well it works for you today.\n\nTime is not a friend to the Borderlands games, which have largely remained stagnant as so-called loot shooters have proliferated around it. The novelty of a game that fused the steady dopamine rush of Diablo-style loot and light role-player character building with some decent shooting has now become common. You can get a similar experience with better shooting in Destiny 2, or with a weirder backstory in Warframe.\n\nBorderlands 3's Review Situation Sure Is Strange Borderlands 3 reviews hit the internet very early today, but only at a select few websites, thanks to a bizarre scenario that publisher 2K says is in place because of security concerns. Read more\n\nA significant point in Borderlands 3\u2019s favour is its size: I\u2019m still very early in this very long game, and while it doesn\u2019t seem interested in a major shift from what came before, there\u2019s plenty of room for little surprises. I\u2019m curious to see what\u2019s lurking in the margins, to dive more deeply into side quests now that I\u2019ve spent some time diving ahead in the main campaign.\n\nThe constantly changing scenery in Borderlands 3 is quite nice.\n\nSo far, the story is serviceable \u2014 you begin the game working for Lilith, the Siren from the very first Borderlands, and are drawn into conflict with the Calypso Twins, a couple of livestreamers with loud personalities and a penchant for snuff. The Calypsos have united all of the bandits of Pandora, and they\u2019ve got designs on finding Vaults\u2014in Borderlands lore, they\u2019re hidden lairs rumoured to be full of unimaginable loot, but in reality often come with a nasty surprise\u2014on planets across the galaxy. So it\u2019s up to you to chase them, because they very clearly won\u2019t use whatever they find in a Vault for any good.\n\nThere are some concerning technical issues \u2014 on a Friday afternoon stream, I played co-op with video producer Paul Tamayo on an Xbox One X, and the game almost ground to a halt, the frame rate protesting as a second player dropped in for a split-screen local game. After a few minutes, it worked out just fine \u2014 until one of us opened our menu to change out loot or look at the map. Then, once again, the game began to chug, and negotiating firefights became far more difficult than it needed to be.\n\nI should note that like many games enhanced for Xbox One X, you can choose to emphasise visual fidelity or frame rate, and I had chosen the former. Regardless, seamless couch co-op is a huge part of Borderlands 3\u2019s appeal, and it should work without issue. I\u2019ll be trying it some more in the coming week to see how consistent a problem this is.\n\nIt\u2019s the biggest problem in a game with rough edges. Most are minor, like some mild texture pop-in or the occasional audio drop that makes your gun suddenly silent (which might irritate you more if you, like me, wish the shooting in Borderlands had more heft.) There was also one instance where a quest-giver completely disappeared mid-mission, barring me from continuing because they were supposed to open a door for me. Fortunately, Borderlands 3 is generous with its checkpoints, and re-starting my game fixed the problem, but I\u2019m still a little wary.\n\nMostly, Borderlands 3 feels like a game that doesn\u2019t have a whole lot to prove. It has piles of guns and a rude attitude and little people to shoot, because hey, isn\u2019t that funny? In its first act, Borderlands 3 luxuriates in low expectations, resting in confidence that its core pleasure of sorting through endless piles of weird and improbable weaponry is enough to skate by. That and, if it works, the all-too-rare pleasure of having a solid shooter that you can play on the couch with someone else.", "description": "Borderlands 3 is almost certainly the game that you think it is.
