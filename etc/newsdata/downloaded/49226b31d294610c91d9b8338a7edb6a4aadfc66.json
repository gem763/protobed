Republican Matt Schaefer said in place of \"so-called gun-control solutions\" he would be \"praying that God would transform the hearts of people with evil intent,\" in a statement posted to his official Facebook page.\n\nSchaefer, the District 6 representative in the Texas House of Representatives, said in the Facebook post he had no plans \"to use the evil acts of a handful of people to diminish the God-given rights of my fellow Texans,\" less than 24 hours after seven people were killed in a shooting in Odessa, Texas.\n\n\"I say NO to \"red flag\" pre-crime laws. NO to universal background checks. NO to bans on AR-15s, or high capacity magazines. NO to mandatory gun buybacks,\" said Schaefer in the post. \"YES to praying for protection. YES to praying that God would transform the hearts of people with evil intent.\"\n\nSchaefer has served District 6, an area roughly 100 miles east of Dallas, since 2013 after winning the 2012 general election when he ran unopposed.\n\nIn 2017, Schaefer proposed a bill that required transgender people to use the bathroom corresponding to their sex at birth. In April, Schaefer put forth a three-part bill pushing for stricter limitations on abortions.\n\nHis position on guns and response to the 283rd mass shooting this year is more extreme than the center of his party, which has largely chosen to talk past the issue of gun control. President Trump tweeted this morning praising local police in response to the shooting, and made no mention of gun control.\n\nProgressive Democrats appear to be taking the opposite approach. The same day as the shooting presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke, who has been an outspoken gun control advocate, called for action on stricter gun control laws.", "description": "Representative Matt Schaefer posted on his official Facebook page that he remained opposed to universal background checks and banning AR-15s.", "authors": ["Dan Defrancesco"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6be96d2e22af696618df52-1334-667.jpg"}
