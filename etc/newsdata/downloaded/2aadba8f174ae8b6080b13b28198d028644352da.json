By Friday evening, one of the units was back on line.\n\nThe new problems with managing coal and ash at Medupi followed a breakdown in a conveyor belt that feeds coal to the power station.\n\nThe 7km-long coal belt transported 4 000 tons per hour from Exxaro\u2019s Grootegeluk mine to Medupi. The tail-end of the belt suddenly snapped and twisted on Saturday, with the weight of the coal damaging the machine. Eskom chair and acting CEO, Jabu Mabuza, said the belt should be fixed by Wednesday.\n\nStage 1 load shedding ended at midday on Friday, with stage 2 following until 23:00.\n\nRecovery efforts are underway to fix the coal handling issues at Medupi and to expedite the return of the units that experience technical problems, Eskom said.\n\n\"Our emergency response command centre will be meeting early tomorrow to assess the progress overnight and prognosis for the weekend and the coming week.\n\n\"We hope to have recovered adequately by Sunday so that South African can enjoy watching the Springboks playing in the World Cup,\" the statement said.\n\nSouth Africa takes on Japan in the Rugby World Cup quarter-final just after midday.\n\nEskom has also blamed the current wave of power cuts, which began on Wednesday, on boiler leaks at six power-generating units. Some of these units are now online.\n\nCompiled by Helena Wasserman", "description": "Stage 1 load shedding has been announced for Saturday, from 09:00 to 23:00.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9494/8598df12059a44079f61fdbbdf07dc43.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
