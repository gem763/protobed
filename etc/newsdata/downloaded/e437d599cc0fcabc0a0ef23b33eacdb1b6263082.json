McDonald\u2019s said its global delivery business \u2014 cutely known as McDelivery \u2014 will drive $4 billion in sales in 2019. At that mark, it would represent about 4% of McDonald\u2019s global system wide sales.\n\n\u201cDelivery remains a big frontier for our business and we still have a long way to go even with our existing customers to encourage awareness and trial,\u201d McDonald\u2019s CEO Steve Easterbrook told analysts on a conference call.\n\nA man working for McDonald's delivery service rides a motorcycle in Tokyo's Taito district on March 26, 2019.

Hence, the fast food pizza players such as Domino\u2019s Pizza and Papa John\u2019s continued to dominate the delivery game.\n\nBut McDonalds has since inked delivery deals with Uber Eats, Doordash and Grubhub in the U.S. while utilizing other outside parties abroad.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s said its delivery service is now available at 23,000 restaurants in over 80 countries.\n\nNot too shabby for the Golden Arches.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
