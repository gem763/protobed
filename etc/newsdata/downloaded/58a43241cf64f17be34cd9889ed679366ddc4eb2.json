REUTERS/Phil Noble/Files\n\nThe U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) said Salazar\u2019s punishment was for \u201corchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct\u201d as head coach of the Nike Oregon Project (NOP), a camp designed primarily to develop U.S. endurance athletes.\n\nEndocrinologist Jeffrey Brown, who worked for NOP on performance enhancement and served as a physician for numerous athletes in the training program, also received a four-year ban.\n\nThe USADA report also cited emails showing that Nike Inc Chief Executive Mark Parker was made aware of experiments by Brown involving AndroGel, a topical testosterone cream that is banned.\n\nNike, one of the world\u2019s biggest sportswear brands which counts many high-profile runners among its sponsored athletes, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on communications between Brown and Parker.\n\nA Wall Street Journal report quoted a Nike spokesperson who said Salazar was concerned runners \u201ccould be sabotaged by someone rubbing testosterone cream on them.\u201d\n\nSalazar was quickly stripped of his accreditation for the world athletics championships in Doha at the request of the U.S. track and field federation, IAAF, the sport\u2019s international governing body, said in a statement.\n\nSalazar, who was a celebrated distance runner, winning three consecutive New York City marathons starting in 1980, vowed to appeal USADA\u2019s decision. Nike said in a statement it would stand by him.\n\n\u201cI am shocked by the outcome today,\u201d Salazar said in a statement. \u201cMy athletes and I have endured unjust, unethical and highly damaging treatment from USADA.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Oregon Project has never and will never permit doping. I will appeal and look forward to this unfair and protracted process reaching the conclusion I know to be true. I will not be commenting further at this time,\u201d the statement concluded.\n\nOn Tuesday, Farah said he was relieved that the investigation was over. \u201cI have no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules or crosses a line,\u201d he said.\n\nUK Athletics said in a statement that its own investigation in 2015, which cleared Farah to work with Salazar, was \u201crestricted to the interaction of the Nike Oregon Project with Mo Farah and not an anti-doping investigation.\u201d\n\nSalazar stopped coaching Farah in 2017, when the runner decided to move back to England. Farah said at the time that the doping investigation was not the reason they parted ways.\n\nUSADA said Salazar, who also coached American Olympian Matthew Centrowitz among other top distance runners, trafficked banned performance-enhancing substance testosterone to multiple athletes. Salazar also tampered or attempted to tamper with NOP athletes\u2019 doping control process, the agency said after concluding its four-year investigation.\n\nNIKE CEO EMAILS\n\nBrown had emailed Nike CEO Parker a decade ago about experiments on what levels of AndroGel would trigger \u201cconcern,\u201d the USADA investigation found.\n\n\u201cWe need to determine the minimal amount of gel that would cause a problem,\u201d he wrote in an email dated July 7, 2009.\n\nParker responded, \u201c(it) will be interesting to determine the minimal amount of topical male hormone required to create a positive test.\u201d\n\nSeveral members of NOP are competing in the world championships, including newly-crowned 10,000m champion Sifan Hassan.\n\n\u201cI am shocked to receive the news of today\u2019s ruling, especially during this time in which I am fully preparing for my next race in the world championships in Doha,\u201d the Dutch runner said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis investigation is focussed on the period before I joined the Oregon Project and therefore has no relation to me,\u201d Hassan added.\n\nNone of the athletes Salazar has worked with were mentioned in Monday\u2019s report.\n\n\u201cThe athletes in these cases found the courage to speak out and ultimately exposed the truth,\u201d USADA CEO Travis Tygart said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWhile acting in connection with the Nike Oregon Project, Mr. Salazar and Dr. Brown demonstrated that winning was more important than the health and wellbeing of the athletes they were sworn to protect,\u201d Tygart added.\n\nSalazar said he had never put winning above the athletes\u2019 safety. \u201cThis is completely false and contrary to the findings of the arbitrators, who even wrote about the care I took in complying with the World Anti-Doping code,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated Coverage Hassan says career thrown into uncertainty by Salazar ban\n\nNike, which funds NOP - the nation\u2019s most elite long-distance running training centre in Portland under a $460 million, 26-year sponsorship deal with US Track and Field - said it would support Salazar\u2019s appeal.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision had nothing to do with administering banned substances to any Oregon Project athlete. As the panel noted, they were struck by the amount of care Alberto took to ensure he was complying with the World Anti-Doping code,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cNike does not condone the use of banned substances in any manner.\u201d", "description": "American Alberto Salazar, who has coached some of the world's top distance runners including Olympic and world champion Mo Farah, has been banned for four years for doping violations.", "authors": ["Gene Cherry", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435815881&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902AI", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
