Other Auckland TVNZers in Christchurch too.

Firefighters are being rotated and fatigue levels are being closely monitored.\u201d\n\nThe convention centre, which is still under construction at a cost of NZ$703m, was slated to be the major venue for the 2021 Apec summit. It is the largest construction project underway in New Zealand.\n\nIt has the potential to be a beautiful building, it\u2019s unique. Now the plan has to be to restore it. Jacinda Ardern\n\nThe prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said there was \u201cno question\u201d Apec would go ahead in the city and, while the fire was disappointing, a pragmatic response was needed as to where Apec would be hosted.\n\n\u201cIt had come so far, and to now see this major, major setback of course will be a real blow to that workforce. But I know they\u2019ll be as committed as everyone here to see that restored,\u201d the prime minister said on Wednesday. \u201cYou can see from the outside, it has the potential to be a beautiful building, it\u2019s unique. Now the plan has to be to restore it.\u201d\n\nAuckland\u2019s recently re-elected mayor, Phil Goff, was praised for his leadership during the turmoil. He said they had been expecting the centre to be finished by around August 2020, and the fire damage meant it could now take more than an extra year to complete.\n\nPhil Goff (@phil_goff) This is what the Convention Centre looks like this morning. Small patches of flame and still some but much diminished smoke. Hopefully in the last stages of extinguishing the fire. pic.twitter.com/w2wqVLREHt\n\nOffice workers in central Auckland \u2013 including council workers and ministry of justice employees \u2013 had been asked to work from home until the fire was out and the smoke \u2013 which has been causing minor health issues \u2013 had dispersed.\n\nResidents in the city centre described the usually bustling CBD as a ghost town, and RNZ reported homeless people were finding it particularly tough. \u201cNot many people pass by and give you stuff, and Skycity has closed down, so no money, no food,\u201d James, a homeless man, said.\n\nHealth warnings have been repeatedly issued for the city centre, with health officials telling residents to shut all windows and turn off airconditioning. Visitors have been told to wear face masks if entering the affected area. Many residents have reported coughing and sore throats from the smoke.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern meets some of the firefighters.

It\u2019s affecting all the businesses really badly. You can see across the street pretty much all the businesses have shut down.\u201d\n\nFletcher Building and SkyCity said the extent of the damage and the next steps would not be known until the fire was extinguished and an investigation could start.", "description": "Hundreds of firefighters brought in to tackle blaze as Jacinda Ardern promises to restore venue", "authors": ["Eleanor Ainge Roy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/991b1eb014debda780a23eabbf914f2f29a08adc/0_28_3371_2022/master/3371.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bf86c14a137681f6b262778be0646a5f", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
