How will Washington respond?", "language": "en", "text": "The lengthy prepared testimony by William B. Taylor Jr. to the House Intelligence Committee is painstakingly clear in its rendition of events. His account directly contradicts the president and asserts that military assistance was withheld for months as Trump was demanding an explicit statement from Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky confirming that he would launch investigations the president wanted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTaylor\u2019s prepared testimony documents with precision and clarity what he heard, saw, wrote and was asked to respond to over a period of weeks. In his telling, the squeeze on Ukraine, and Trump\u2019s role in it, goes well beyond a single phone call July 25 between the U.S. president and Zelensky.\n\nTrump\u2019s long-standing characterization that there was no quid pro quo runs smack into evidence to the contrary. Characterizations now count for less than explanations. How does he explain what Taylor outlines, which is that Trump was directly linking military assistance to demands that the Ukraine president announce publicly his intention to start investigations into the 2016 campaign and former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden?\n\nRepublican lawmakers face a new calculus as they digest the contents of the Taylor testimony. They will have great difficulty denying that the suspension of the aid was being linked to an investigation of a political rival of the president. Will they conclude that what the president did was legitimate? Will they attempt to point in other directions? Will they argue that what Trump did wasn\u2019t right but isn\u2019t impeachable? There\u2019s less room for equivocation about what happened today than there was before.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTaylor, who was newly reassigned to the embassy in Kyiv, describes events that took place over several months during the summer as he struggled to make sense of a dual-track diplomatic effort \u2014 one run through regular channels and another led by Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, whose efforts in Taylor\u2019s view were detrimental to U.S. and Ukrainian interests.\n\nTrump has called the July 25 phone call \u201cperfect.\u201d In that conversation, he asked for \u201ca favor\u201d from Zelensky and specifically mentioned 2016 and the Bidens. He has pointed to the rough transcript of the phone call to suggest there was nothing explicit enough in the exchange to warrant an impeachment inquiry, which he has regularly denounced and which he likened Tuesday to \u201ca lynching.\u201d\n\nTaylor\u2019s prepared testimony, however, dramatically undercuts the argument that there was no linkage. Taylor acknowledges that Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union and a central figure in the Ukraine matter, explicitly told Taylor that Trump said there was no quid pro quo. But Taylor\u2019s version of events makes it clear that denying there was no quid pro quo doesn\u2019t square with the facts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt first, Taylor could not quite put the pieces together, but slowly they fell into place. Taylor, the senior diplomat in Ukraine and a former ambassador to that country, testified that until the president released the rough transcript of the July 25 telephone call with Zelensky, he had not been read into the contents of it.\n\nWhat he eventually realized, but not until much later, was that the official policy of the United States \u2014 a policy of strong support for Ukraine in the face of Russian hostility and military threat \u2014 was \u201cundercut by the irregular efforts led by Mr. Giuliani.\u201d\n\nTaylor says he was told by another official that Trump had told Sondland he wasn\u2019t asking for a quid pro quo. \u201cBut President Trump did insist that President [Zelensky] go to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference,\u201d according to the prepared testimony.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf that is how things played out, that is about as explicit as it can be. And it was shortly after that when Taylor told Sondland and Kurt Volker, who was special envoy for Ukraine, \u201cI think it is crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d Days later, the hold on the military aid was lifted.\n\nIf there is a contrary version of events, the president is now under pressure to present it. Taylor outlines phone calls, diplomatic cables, face-to-face meetings and text messages among a group of U.S. officials during the period when military aid had been suspended, though for no clear reason other than by order of the president.\n\nThe first response from the White House to Taylor\u2019s testimony came in a statement by press secretary Stephanie Grisham. She characterized Tuesday\u2019s developments as part of \u201ca coordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEver since Trump released the rough transcript of the telephone call with Zelensky, the president\u2019s position has been continuously weakened.\n\nThere was the whistleblower\u2019s complaint that offered background that buttressed the transcript of the telephone call. Other witnesses, including Marie Yovanovitch, who was summarily removed as ambassador to Ukraine, and Fiona Hill, who had been the National Security Council\u2019s top expert on Russia, have presented damning testimony about the two-track diplomatic efforts, Giuliani\u2019s role and what became an internal war inside the administration over who should control Ukraine policy. Taylor\u2019s testimony adds significantly to the chronology of events, and with the kind of documentation that will be difficult to refute.\n\nTaylor will not be the last word in the investigation. Other witnesses will appear before the Intelligence Committee. The White House will have an opportunity to offer additional explanations or a counternarrative. The president\u2019s allies will, too. But what was put into the record Tuesday, unless there is a powerful rebuttal that goes beyond simple denials, makes the debate of the words \u201cquid pro quo\u201d less relevant than the question of how lawmakers react to what happened.\n\nAD", "description": "A senior diplomat, in a closed hearing, challenged Trump\u2019s characterizations with a detailed rendering of events over many weeks.", "authors": ["Dan Balz", "Chief Correspondent Covering National Politics", "The Presidency"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PjDiI8k-SXW07n7Q9SRZP_Anv3s=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6HTVKMXU2II6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
