Teachers can go through results one by one to see where students have improved or weakened, and modify classes accordingly.\n\nNAPLAN online takes the process a step up. Each kid does a purpose-made test, with an algorithm adjusting the toughness of questions in real time to compensate for their abilities, giving teachers insight into success and failure that would have been unimaginable five years ago and does not exist in any other country.\n\nAs Nick Reece, a former policy adviser to Julia Gillard said: \"All the worlds' leading education systems are moving towards data-driven policymaking. For Australia to get off that train would be an act of national self harm.\"\n\nSo it's puzzling that prominent policy makers such as education minister Grace Grace in Queensland, James Merlino in Victoria, Sarah Mitchell in NSW and her departmental secretary Mark Scott have such a visceral dislike of NAPLAN.\n\nInstead of using the data to get better performance, they criticise the test and chip away at it with review after review (five in the last 16 months) eroding parents' confidence and handing free ammunition to teaching unions to attack spending policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the man who invented NAPLAN, Tom Bentely, told The Australian Financial Review, \"if we want real progress, we need to look at school results with a consistent frame of reference and that's only possible with a framework like NAPLAN\".\n\nThe school lobby and teaching unions have won a staggering bucket of money from government. Total spending, all governments, on schools is running at $1 billion a week.\n\nFederal government spending on schools alone will rise from $17.5 billion in 2017 to $32.4 billion a year in 2029, thanks to the extra money injected by the Gonski reforms most of which the schools lobby got without giving anything in return.\n\nThere has been negligible movement from the states on Gonski's recommendations for mapping literacy and numeracy more effectively, professional development for mid-career teachers, better classroom training for new teachers and new career paths and pay rates freed from seniority.\n\nMaybe teaching unions and policy makers don't like what NAPLAN results are telling them, which is that reading, grammar and numeracy has barely improved since 2008. With the exception of stand outs like Ballajura Primary school in WA, writing performance is actually deteriorating.\n\nBlaming the messenger never worked and NAPLAN critics will have to resort to another tactic when PISA results come out on December 3.\n\nThe OECD's Program for International Student Assessment is published every three years and the 2016 results were dire. The performance of Australian students in reading, maths and science had decreased significantly over the previous 15 years.\n\nIf the trend continues the federal government will have every reason to hold the states to account especially those which, for political reasons, play games with NAPLAN.\n\nThe irony is NAPLAN is the one tool that states could be using to improve results, as Ballajura Primary School shows.\n\nThe Gonski reforms gave school systems a tool kit to work with: an evidence institute, better managed classrooms, better pay for teachers who deliver and stacks of extra money.\n\nGive teachers NAPLAN data on where students are weak -- and let them get to work on improving results.", "description": "The data tells teachers where they are wrong but state policy makers have a fight to pick with Canberra.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/78e753b53d04cf103767d82a7711a870a9afd692", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
