According to leaked recordings from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the Massachusetts senator\u2019s plan to undo mergers between tech giants won\u2019t go down without a major fight from his camp. Meanwhile, theDemocratic presidential candidate, who is running on a policy-driven platform, tweeted yesterday that she won\u2019t back down from Zuckerberg\u2019s threats, creating a potential war between Facebook and the U.S. government if she\u2019s elected in 2020.\n\n\u201cIf she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg announced in a leaked recording addressing Facebook employees. \u201cAt the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s plan to \u201cBreak Up Big Tech\u201d was fueled in large part after she orchestrated a massive campaign billboard with her face on it in the middle of Silicon Valley. Now, she is making good on her promise after launching a proposed plan that targets Facebook, Amazon, Google, and a number of major tech giants. The plan of attack, which she introduced in early 2019, detailed a way to break up the monopoly of big tech companies. But it struck a major nerve with Zuckerberg.\n\nAccording to recordings acquired by the Verve, Zuckerberg says it would \u201csuck\u201d to be in a legal war with the United States government, but it\u2019s one he is fully prepared for if Warren is elected.\n\nAfter hearing the recordings for herself, Warren jumped right back into the conversation with a series of tweets yesterday, illustrating her proposal (and demonstrating that she is definitely not backing down from the Facebook CEO\u2019s idle threats).\n\n\u201cWhat would really \u201csuck\u201d is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices,\u201d Warren tweeted. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to hold Big Tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon accountable. It\u2019s time to #BreakUpBigTech.\u201d\n\nFacebook is doing pretty well right now. They\u2019ve acquired potential competitors WhatsApp and Instagram. More than 85% of all social networking traffic goes through sites owned or operated by Facebook. They\u2019ve got a lot of power\u2014and face little competition or accountability. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 1, 2019\n\nBut what exactly is Warren proposing that\u2019s scaring Zuckerberg into company-wide announcements like this? According to her plan, Warren wants to break up mergers between major tech companies that monopolize a specific sphere of the industry. For example, she doesn\u2019t want to see huge companies like Google or Apple taking over every part of the tech scene, which is basically the direction we\u2019ve been heading in for over a decade. But, according to Warren, her efforts to take down \u201cBig Tech\u201d serve a greater purpose: to protect user information from being shared across multiple platforms owned by the same company (i.e. Facebook and Instagram and WhatsApp).\n\nImagine Facebook and Instagram trying to outdo each other to protect your privacy and keep misinformation out of your feed, instead of working together to sell your data, inundate you with misinformation, and undermine our election security. That\u2019s why we need to #BreakUpBigTech. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 1, 2019\n\nFor Facebook, this would mean dividing up the company\u2019s brands, which include Instagram and WhatsApp to \u201cpromote healthy competition in the market.\u201d Warren\u2019s greater initiative to break up the tech giants isn\u2019t so far-fetched, either \u2014 according to a poll last month, almost two-thirds of Americans are on board with this overall plan if it means more privacy for users and a leveled playing field for online content.\n\nBut just as Warren is pleading to force Facebook to relinquish ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp, Zuckerberg is gearing up for an all out war under a Warren administration. The CEO backed up his own leaked recordings in a Facebook post yesterday, urging people to read his now-public comments and decide for themselves where they stand in the war against big tech.\n\nLike what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?\n\nElizabeth Warren Pulls Ahead In New Iowa Poll\n\nInstagram Is Changing How Blocking Works\n\nMeet Three Women Changing The Intersection Of Art", "description": "Mandatory Credit: Photo by Steven Ferdman/Shutterstock (10415774x) Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren, US Presidential Election Campaigning, New York, USA \u2013 16 Sep 2019 Washington Square ParkAs Elizabeth Warren ramps up her campaign to break up big tech one company is preparing for battle.
