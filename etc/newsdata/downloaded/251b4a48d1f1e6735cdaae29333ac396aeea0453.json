However, disaster seemingly strikes when their map gets blown away at sea.\n\nIt will then be up to fans watching at home to vote for what happens to the boys next, via the official I\u2019m A Celebrity app.\n\nThey will have two options to choose from \u2013 Tropical Tides or Arctic Antics, so we know things will get worse on their trip to Oz before it gets better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe scenario with the most votes will then be aired on TV in a few weeks time, leading up to the boys eventual arrival (hopefully!) to coincide with the start of the new series.\n\nAnt and Dec have filmed seven different promos altogether, so viewers really will be in for an epic quest where they get to decide the outcome.\n\nDec wore a sailor\u2019s hat (Picture: ITV)\n\nAnt looked happy to be back (Picture: ITV)\n\nFans will get three times to vote for their chosen scenario over the next month.\n\nNow that I\u2019m A Celebrity is officially returning, we shouldn\u2019t just be concerned that Ant and Dec are technically lost at sea, there\u2019s still so much speculation as to who will actually be appearing in the jungle this year.\n\nWe\u2019ve compiled a handy break-down of everyone we think is in the running for a place at the campsite. Capital FM DJ Roman Kemp has also already refused to deny claims that he\u2019s signed up for a stint on the show too.\n\nI\u2019m A Celebrity returns to ITV1 this winter.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
