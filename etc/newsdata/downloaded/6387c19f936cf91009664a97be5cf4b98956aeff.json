I may be getting carried away there and come Monday, the U.S. may be announcing new tariffs and the UK facing up to no deal again but we should enjoy it while it lasts.\n\nIn both cases, we have huge meetings today that will convert optimism into euphoria or leave us feeling silly for getting carried away in the first place. No big deal. Trump welcomes Chinese Vice Premier Liu He to the White House after productive talks with his trade team on Thursday in what could be the first step towards de-escalating the trade war that has plagued the global economy for the last year.\n\nBoris has always been good with words but traders were delighted at the joint statement from Johnson and Varadkar, in which they agreed that they could see \u201ca pathway to a possible deal\u201d. This could prove to be nothing more than empty words but it does at least sound more positive, although the DUP may be a little more apprehensive.\n\nsoared 2% on the joint statement and is adding to these gains today. Despite the threat of no-deal there has been bullish pressures building in the pound which perhaps indicates that traders either don\u2019t buy Johnson\u2019s warnings and expect an extension, or they think his efforts will bear fruit. They leapt at yesterday\u2019s news though.\n\nOil jumps on tanker attack\n\nare up around 2% today following reports of an attack on an Iranian oil tanker in the red sea. Traders may not be concerned about lost output in this case but the suggestion is that the missiles came from Saudi Arabia which could represent an escalation in the region after a period of calm following the attack last month.\n\nOnce again though, traders seem reluctant to price in increased geopolitical risk, instead fully engrossed in the global growth narrative and the pressure that will put on . Oil had already been given a lift by progress in Washington yesterday as traders celebrated the perceived reduced risk of recession.\n\nDaily Chart\n\nBrent Daily Chart\n\nGold vulnerable as Brexit and trade talks progress\n\nprices are recovering a little this morning on the back of the Iranian oil tanker attack to trade around $1,500. They had slipped back to $1,490 on Thursday on the back of the positive developments on the trade war and Brexit. If both of these can maintain their positive momentum on Friday, gold could come under some serious pressure and $1,480 will once again look very vulnerable. $1,460 is the next test for gold, with it having found support here earlier this month but further downside could be on the cards.\n\nGold Daily Chart\n\nGold Daily Chart\n\nEconomic Calendar\n\nEconomic Calendar\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Stocks Analysis by MarketPulse (Craig Erlam) covering: GBP/USD, XAU/USD, Gold Futures, Brent Oil Futures.
