No, That\u2019s Not a Compliment.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cI used to think my life was a tragedy, but now I realize it\u2019s a fucking comedy.\u201d So speaks the Joker (played by Joaquin Phoenix), the face-painted title character in Todd Phillips\u2019s new film. Well, I have news for Mr. Joker. He may think life tragicomic, but the movie he\u2019s in is very much a drama\u2014a pompous, grim, relentlessly one-note adaptation bent on proving just how far removed it is from its comic-book heritage.\n\nJoker, fresh off a victory at this year\u2019s Venice Film Festival, is arriving in cinemas on a sea of hype and controversy. Its depiction of a troubled antihero driven to mass murder is generating so much concern that its own studio had to issue a statement clarifying that the film is not \u201can endorsement of real-world violence of any kind.\u201d Plenty of external factors contributed to that clarification, and the film itself is clearly not intended to function as a depraved call to arms for the world\u2019s villainous clowns. It is, however, a project drowning in self-seriousness. In his effort to bring realism to the Joker story, Phillips has lost his grasp on the character\u2019s symbolic purpose, treating the audience to something undeniably visceral, but also unacceptably shallow.\n\nThrough the decades, the Joker\u2019s persona (he\u2019s best known as a longtime menace to Batman) has fluctuated between scary and campy, with the two best movie depictions\u2014Jack Nicholson\u2019s and Heath Ledger\u2019s\u2014capturing his menacing archness from entirely different angles. Phillips\u2019s film, which he co-scripted with Scott Silver (The Fighter, 8 Mile), skips the Caped Crusader and focuses entirely on the man who will become the Joker, while largely dispensing with the various origin tales suggested in the comics. Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, an unstable wannabe comedian struggling to keep afloat in crime-ridden Gotham City. Over two hours, the audience watches as Arthur\u2019s resentment of his smothering mother (Frances Conroy), his crush on their next-door neighbor Sophie (Zazie Beetz), and his tendency to get hassled on the street boils over from loneliness into murderous psychosis.", "description": "Bent on proving its distance from the comic-book-movie genre, Todd Phillips\u2019s adaptation of a classic villain\u2019s origin story is pompous, grim, and one-note.", "authors": ["David Sims"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/joker2/facebook.jpg?1569948213"}
