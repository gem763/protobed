Turkey Pulls Off Jumbo Rate Cut and Signals Slower Easing Ahead\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Turkey delivered another interest-rate cut that exceeded forecasts while signaling the central bank could now proceed with caution as it navigates the conflicting demands of the presidency and markets.\n\nGovernor Murat Uysal reduced the key rate to 16.5% from 19.75% on Thursday, exceeding the forecasts of most economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The Monetary Policy Committee said inflation is likely to end the year below its earlier forecasts but suggested less scope for deeper easing. The lira gained.\n\n\u201cAt this point, the current monetary policy stance, to a large part, is considered to be consistent with the projected disinflation path,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nBoxed in by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Uysal is following up on his record monetary easing in July with his second bold move, bringing cuts under his watch to 7.5 percentage points while still leaving rates above inflation. As the economy is only starting to make up ground lost during recession and there\u2019s little room for fiscal stimulus, the central bank is taking center stage for Erdogan, who believes that high rates cause rather than curb price growth.\n\n\u2018Reasonable\u2019 Return\n\nThe only adjustment in forward guidance from July\u2019s decision suggests the central bank thinks it might be nearing the end of its easing cycle, according to Piotr Matys, a strategist at Rabobank in London.\n\n\u201cIf the central bank is mindful of market expectations, the pace of easing is likely to slow down as the policy rate approaches a level which is tolerated by investors,\u2019\u2019 Matys said.\n\nThe governor, whose predecessor was fired for failing to act faster, has already signaled that more cuts were in the cards but also vowed to preserve \u201ca reasonable rate of real return\u201d for investors. Turkey\u2019s price growth, currently at 15%, will end the year at 13.9%, according to the central bank\u2019s latest forecast.\n\nA steep deceleration in price growth that looms as early as this month probably clinched the argument for Uysal. Before the latest rate cut, Turkey\u2019s benchmark was double the average for its emerging-market peers, providing room for 4 percentage points of easing relative to the central bank\u2019s year-end forecast for inflation, according to Bank of America Corp (NYSE: ).\n\nWhen Uysal slashed the benchmark by 425 basis points in July, against a market expectation of 250 basis points, it was the first reduction since 2016 and the biggest since a shift to inflation targeting in 2002.\n\nA rare calm has settled over the market before the decision. After soaring to an eight-month high ahead of the central bank\u2019s July meeting, volatility in Turkish stocks has come down before this week\u2019s gathering. The appreciated for a second day, trading 1.1% stronger against the dollar as of 2:18 p.m. in Istanbul.\n\nJust days ahead of this week\u2019s meeting, Erdogan laid down a marker for the central bank, suggesting Turkey will lower borrowing costs to single digits soon and inflation will follow suit. Confronting more restless voters and other political challenges, the president will have little patience for a \u201cmore moderate\u201d easing cycle, Wolfango Piccoli, co-president at Teneo Intelligence, said before the decision.\n\n\u201cIn his fight for political survival, Erdogan will not hesitate to use whatever means he has available,\u201d Piccoli said. \u201cThis week\u2019s tool will be monetary policy.\u201d", "description": "Turkey Pulls Off Jumbo Rate Cut and Signals Slower Easing Ahead", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE7C0B7_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
