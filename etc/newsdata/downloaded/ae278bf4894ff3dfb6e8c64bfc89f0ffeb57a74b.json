Erasmus gave the credit to the players.\n\n\u201cThe way the players in the last two, two and half years took the responsibility of being very professional and taking ownership of what it means to be a professional rugby player has been the big difference,\u201d said Erasmus.\n\n\u201cThere was a stage in South Africa where being a professional rugby player was just earning a pay cheques, but I think currently players understand that if they want to be a professional rugby player, they have to work really hard.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t just move from province to province and collect a pay cheque. That attitude is slowly spreading throughout the provinces and the franchises and players are really pushing each other.\n\n\u201cThat whole level of mediocrity is slowly going out of our game \u2013 not that we have achieved anything yet. But we are slowly moving up to the standards where other nations are maximising their potential.\n\n\u201cOverall the players deserve a lot of credit for taking a more professional approach towards professional rugby.\u201d\n\nHowever, even Erasmus said he was not expecting such a speedy transformation.\n\n\u201cIt has surprised me because we had to make a few changes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe made changes to the regulations in using overseas players; we had to talk to the franchises in terms of getting conditioning standards the same; we had to get Vodacom Super Rugby coaches to work together.\n\n\u201cWhat surprised me was that they bought into the whole system, because that normally takes years for them to start working together.\n\n\u201cThat was a positive that allowed us to turn around quickly.\n\n\u201cBut we are only in the final \u2013 let\u2019s see how the final goes and then we\u2019ll really know if we\u2019ve turned the corner as much as we wanted to.\u201d\n\nThe Springboks take on England at the Yokohama International Stadium on Saturday, with kick off at 11:00 (SA time).", "description": "Rassie Erasmus heaped praise on his Springbok players for carrying South Africa to a third Rugby World Cup final in an achingly tense semi-final with Wales.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7618/6c1beae8a82d4a2e935440f8b83efeee.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
