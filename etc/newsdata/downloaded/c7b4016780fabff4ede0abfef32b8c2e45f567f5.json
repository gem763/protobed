I can't put my legs on by myself\u2026 They shrink a bit (during the day) and I need help to put more socks on. Thankfully I have friends who can help.'\n\nHis report is currently being regraded, which may mean he can be able to afford an appropriate two-bedroom unit in Mona Vale that will allow him to live with his daughter Jhayda.\n\nHe faces another hurdle as there are limited spots available, he claims.\n\nHe told the Daily Telegraph the Mona Vale unit was the only specialist accommodation on the peninsula currently available.\n\n'Mentally I've been strong throughout everything that has happened in the last 12 months, but this has cracked me,' he said.\n\n'Some days I'm just not myself. I don't want to talk to anyone.\n\n'At the moment I am looking at having to move into a nursing home until there is something else available.'\n\n'We were told multiple times he has a less than 10 per cent chance of survival,' Kate Munn \u2013 Jason's sister-in-law \u2013 told Daily Mail Australia. 'Not just once or twice. Many times we were told he might not make it through the next few hours.'\n\n'A true miracle': Buddy's fighting spirit came out in full force and to the surprise of doctors, nurses and his family, five days later he woke up\n\nJason Miller (pictured), 49 - known to his family and friends as Buddy - was admitted to hospital and within an hour he was fighting for his life in October last year\n\nMr Miller was flying back to Sydney in October last year when his health took a turn for the worst.\n\nHe initially thought it was the flu but when he was finally admitted to hospital he was put in a coma, diagnosed with a bacterial infection from both streptococcus and aerococcus that caused toxic shock syndrome and severe septic shock.\n\nOn advice from doctors that his heart would soon give out, the family also called in a priest to give him his last rites.\n\nMr Miller (pictured) had both his hands and both feet amputated in a bid to stop the infection from spreading\n\nWHAT IS SEPSIS? Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by the body's response to an infection. The body normally releases chemicals into the bloodstream to fight an infection. It occurs when the body's response to these chemicals is out of balance, triggering changes that can damage multiple organ systems. Symptoms include fever, difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, fast heart rate and mental confusion.\n\nBut Mr Miller's fighting spirit came out in full force and to the surprise of doctors, nurses and his family, five days later he woke up.\n\nHis positive attitude has been called inspiring by health care workers.\n\nHe said he feels lucky just be alive.\n\n'Sepsis attacked my body, the adrenaline and sepsis shrunk my veins and my limbs all turned black and I lost my hands and I lost my feet, but I got my life back so that was alright,' he told Seven News.\n\nDespite Mr Miller's claims, an NDIS spokesperson said he has been approved for specialist accommodation.\n\n'The NDIA will continue to work with Mr Miller to ensure he is able to access appropriate accommodation and other disability-related supports he needs,' the spokesperson said.\n\n", "description": "Jason Miller, 49 - known to his family and friends as Buddy - almost died after developing a severe infection while in the Philippines last year.", "authors": ["Kelsey Wilkie For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/22/20350270-0-image-a-11_1572387409276.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
