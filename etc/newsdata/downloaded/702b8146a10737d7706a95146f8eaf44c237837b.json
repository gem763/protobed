When we are talking about how we are going to score goals, they say, \u2018We will just give the ball to Anthony.\u2019\n\n(Image: ANDREJ CUKIC/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\n\u201cHe has the confidence of his team-mates and his manager \u00adbecause we see him every day in training.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve now got to do is set the team up to get the best out of him, but I think he will improve by just staying fit and playing more games.\u201d Lukaku was sold to Inter Milan in the summer, despite scoring 41 goals in two seasons at Old Trafford.\n\nAnd Alexis Sanchez was allowed to join the Belgian on loan at the San Siro after failing to justify his \u00a3500,000-a-week wages.\n\nUnited chiefs felt the pair were becoming a \u00addisruptive dressing-room influence after losing their places in Soskjaer\u2019s team last season.\n\nThe United boss made a clear statement of intent by handing Martial the No.9 shirt that had been stripped from him by Jose Mourinho, following the \u00a375million purchase of Lukaku. Solskjaer feels the 23-year-old paid the price for being used as a winger by the \u00adPortuguese boss and by Louis van Gaal.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAnd he insists Martial can be his smiling assassin after being \u00adoften misunderstood as a misery- guts during his time in \u00adManchester.\n\nSolskjaer said: \u201cPeople have the wrong idea about Anthony. He is a lad who enjoys life and always has a smile on his face. I know some people will be surprised by that because he is \u00adalways being criticised for having poor body language.\n\n\u201cBut he is happy again. He always wanted to be Manchester United \u2019s No.9 \u2013 and he\u2019s got his number back.\n\n\u201cWe have missed him for the last eight weeks. We hoped to have him back earlier and he was so desperate to play that he really pushed his recovery and ended up having a small recurrence.\u201d\n\nSolskjaer added: \u201cAnthony got put out on the wing by other managers and I understand why because he is so quick.\n\n\u201cBut, for me, he is a proper No.9. He needs to be connected to the game. He has to be in the action all the time to be the best player he can.\n\n\u201cI am absolutely certain that, if we get the ball to him in the right positions, then he will be scoring goals for fun.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Solskjaer has a sense of promise for the future at Man Utd with Martial back at full fitness", "authors": ["Simon Mullock", "Image", "Srdjan Suki Epa-Efe Rex", "Empics Sport", "Andrej Cukic Epa-Efe Rex", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20733151.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MAIN-OLE-GUNNAR-SOLSKJAER-insists-that-Manchester-United-dont-need-Harry-Kane-when-they-have-Anthony-Mar.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
