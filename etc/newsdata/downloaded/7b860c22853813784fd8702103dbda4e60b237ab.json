His stance has garnered criticism from civil rights leaders, presidential candidates and bipartisan lawmakers.\n\n\u201cWe talk a lot about speech and expression and we don\u2019t talk about reach enough, and we don\u2019t talk about amplification,\u201d Dorsey said at the Twitter News Summit in New York on Thursday, according to Bloomberg. \u201cAnd reach and amplification was not represented in that speech.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg also used his remarks to suggest that giving people in the early 2000s a voice to discuss the U.S. war in Iraq was a motive for Facebook's founding. The social media behemoth began as a tool to rate Harvard students\u2019 attractiveness.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some amount of revisionist history in all his storytelling,\u201d Dorsey said of Zuckerberg. \u201cIt takes away from the authenticity and the genuineness of what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d\n\nDorsey\u2019s comments came after Zuckerberg testified during a U.S. House Financial Services Committee hearing, a session in which several lawmakers skewered him over Facebook\u2019s controversial ad policy.\n\nDuring one terse exchange, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., pushed Zuckerberg about whether she could run an ad targeting Republicans running for re-election and falsely say they voted for the Green New Deal. Zuckerberg said he did not know the answer \"off the top of his head.\"\n\n\"Do you see a problem here with a complete lack of fact-checking on political advertisements?\" Ocasio-Cortez asked. \"So you will take down lies or you won't take down lies? I think this is a pretty simple yes or no.\"\n\nOf course, Twitter is dealing with its own free speech, content moderation and misinformation problems, many of them similar to Facebook\u2019s. Twitter, Trump\u2019s go-to communication platform, has also been urged to suspend the president\u2019s account, which has more than 65 million followers.\n\nTrump's tweets \"rise to the level that Twitter should consider suspending his account. Others have had their accounts suspended for less offensive behavior,\u201d Democratic presidential candidate and California Sen. Kamala Harris wrote in a recent letter to Dorsey. \u201cWhen this kind of abuse is being spewed from the most powerful office in the United States, the stakes are too high to do nothing.\u201d\n\nAlthough the company agreed to flag and give added context to tweets that violate its policies, it has repeatedly refused to remove world leaders' accounts, saying their posts are inherently newsworthy.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Dorsey was commenting on Zuckerberg\u2019s 40-minute speech at Georgetown last week.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Dorsey-Zuckerberg-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
