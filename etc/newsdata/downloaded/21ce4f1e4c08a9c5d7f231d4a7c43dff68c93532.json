This is the first time since the government began tallying consumer prices 54 years ago that consumer prices have fallen for two months running. Despite vehement denials by the government officials, that does point to deflation across the board. In other words, the economic downturn is being exacerbated by an incorrect diagnosis from the government, leading to serious concerns that Korea is following in the footsteps of Japan, which suffered a 20-year-long economic slump due to faulty policy decisions.\n\nThe Korean economy is suffering from 10 consecutive months of sharply declining exports and corporate investment. Manufacturing output has been declining for 13 months, while economic conditions affecting average wage earners have deteriorated drastically. The government poured trillions of won into job growth, but only managed to create 520,000 temporary jobs even as 1.18 million full-time jobs have been lost. That means the government needs to change tack and breathe new life into the economy, instead of coming up with and endless parade of measures that weaken business competitiveness.\n\nThe government has bulldozed through a sharp increase in the minimum wage, slashed the working week, and boosted corporate taxes. Some of that may in principle be a good idea, but a recession is the wrong time to force it through. The Moon Jae-in administration also wants to phase out nuclear power, which at the moment is cheap and clean, by labeling it an environmental threat, which has paradoxically led to worse pollution from expensive coal power. Meanwhile militant labor unions' ranks have swelled to more than a million, and bolstered welfare policies have led to budgetary spending rising by more than W100 trillion over the last three years (US$1=W1,202). All of this saps the vitality of the private sector.\n\nYet Cheong Wa Dae insists that the economy is \"headed in the right direction.\" But warning signs are becoming apparent that the economy has entered a drawn-out slump. The government is not only inept, it is proud of its incompetence, suggesting that the \"right direction\" is ever downwards. How can these people be expected to pull the country out of its self-inflicted slump if it falls into a deflationary vortex as well?\n\n", "description": "Deflation Threat Exposes Gov't's Incompetence", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
