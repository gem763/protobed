I was 31. I had a house and career and wanted to help her.\n\nI encouraged her to go to university, and when she fell pregnant \u2014 first with our son and then our daughter \u2014 I took on most of the domestic workload, while also working full-time from home. In 2017, she proposed to me on her 30th birthday in front of family and friends, and I said yes.\n\nAn anonymous reader asked TV\u2019s Steph and Dom Parker for advice on being in a relationship with a partner who keeps changing their mind about splitting up (file image)\n\nThe problem is she keeps changing her mind: one moment wanting to split up as she\u2019s no longer attracted to me, and the next wanting to hold hands. Now she wants to be \u2018exclusive but not intimate\u2019.\n\nWe\u2019ve only had sex twice in six months. My gut tells me that she\u2019s stringing me along. Should I bite the bullet and ask her to move out? Or hope she changes her mind again?\n\nSTEPH SAYS: Thank you for writing this letter. In the longer version, you detail the full saga of your rollercoaster relationship \u2014 and by putting it down on paper, I think you\u2019ve taken the first step towards taking back control of your life.\n\nIn a way, you\u2019ve bet your heart and your self-esteem on this relationship; and like a gambler who keeps throwing good money after bad, you refuse to scoop up your chips and leave the table in case the next spin of the wheel delivers a big win. I think you know deep down it\u2019s unlikely.\n\nI\u2019m particularly concerned about that marriage proposal.\n\nIn my experience, when people ask others to marry them in such a grand gesture and in front of family and friends, it\u2019s often a way to head off rejection. After all who\u2019s going to turn down a long-term partner in front of their parents and pals? It\u2019s manipulative behaviour, and I think you know this, too.\n\nWhat I think you are actually asking me is for permission to end what has become a flawed and chaotic relationship. Well, I can\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s not for me to decide. But what I\u2019d like to do is give you the tools to take control of that decision.\n\nFirst of all, you must understand what you\u2019re going to sacrifice. You can\u2019t just \u2018ask her to move out\u2019 if that includes asking the children to leave, too. Are they going to live with you or her?\n\nSteph (pictured with Dom) told the reader that he's allowed himself to be taken for granted and urged him to take control of the situation\n\nMorally, you are bound to provide for your family \u2014 and I know this will be a priority for you \u2014 so one potential solution is to think about selling your house and buying two smaller places for you and the mother of your children to live in. It\u2019s hard for children to see their family split up, but less hard than living with parents who begrudge each other the very basics of a happy adult relationship.\n\nWhat\u2019s required here is a massive dose of honesty.\n\nYou\u2019ve allowed yourself to be taken for granted; you feel a failure in your own eyes, and, if you\u2019re not careful, you\u2019ll never trust another woman again.\n\nYour gut says it\u2019s over \u2014 trust it!\n\nYes, she might change her mind in the short term and your relationship might go through another of those loved-up patches, but in six months or a year will that still be the case?\n\nThere are mediators who can walk you through the pros and cons of separating and how to do it amicably, if that\u2019s what you decide. Find one and talk it through with your fianc\u00e9e.\n\nYou\u2019ve done the hard part, which is asking for help. Now have courage and take control of this vastly difficult process. You will emerge stronger for having done so.\n\nDOM SAYS: Thank you for writing to us, but, gosh, what a mess. I\u2019m sorry to hear how tense your relationship has become or perhaps always was.\n\nThe first thing that strikes me is that there is no mention of love in your letter. Not once.\n\nThe truth is, this was a relationship built around circumstance rather than entered into for love, and I\u2019m afraid those kinds don\u2019t always have the happiest of endings.\n\nDom (pictured) advised the reader to seek help from a professional couple's therapist and to decide if they should permanently separate\n\nAt the same time, I want to say how much I commend you for trying to do the decent thing. You saw a young woman who needed help, and you stepped in and provided it like a knight on a white charger. That was an admirable deed, and I wish, for your sake, it had turned into the fairy tale you wanted it to be.\n\nAre you being strung along? I can\u2019t tell you, but I do know that relationships are hard work, and never harder than in those first few years after starting a family. Small children are a joy, but not necessarily an unmitigated one. Anyone honest will tell you that sex does go off the table at some stage after having babies, if only through lack of energy.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e is not the first woman to have found her attraction to her man waning with motherhood, though few, I hope, blurt it out quite so hurtfully.\n\nGrow up for the sake of your kids\n\nAll of these problems \u2014 the lack of sex, the confusion surrounding the relationship as a whole \u2014 clearly need work. The problem is you\u2019re the only one doing any!\n\nWe don\u2019t have her side of the story, of course, but in your longer letter you sound frustrated and resentful. All partnerships need both sides to be equally willing to work at them and you feel her unwillingness keenly. Of course, what\u2019s imperative is to put the kids first. Between you, you are responsible for three beautiful children, and you have a duty to ensure their lives are not destroyed because their parents are consumed by bitterness. (I also add: where is the first little girl\u2019s biological father? Has he taken any responsibility for her? Will he?)\n\nSo you must act like adults and sensibly end this emotional turbulence. I think you need a professional to help you, and I\u2019d strongly recommend seeking a couple\u2019s therapist.\n\nTogether you must make a decision about your future as a family. If in some ways your fianc\u00e9e has already checked out of the relationship, it is only fair that you both now decide whether to make that a permanent break or not.\n\nI found your letter a moving and difficult read. I wish you and your children a happier future.\n\nIf you have a question you\u2019d like Steph and Dom to tackle, write to: stephanddom@dailymail.co.uk", "description": "An anonymous reader asked for advice on being in a relationship without intimacy.
