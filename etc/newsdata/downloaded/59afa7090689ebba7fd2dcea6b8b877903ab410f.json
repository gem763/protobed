We have high expectations of our managers (and staff), not just with regards to returns but also in how they exhibit integrity and respect to all individuals.\"\n\nBraeutigam characterized Fisher's remarks as \"completely unacceptable comments\" and said Michigan was cutting ties even though Fisher Investments' \"performance has been good (beating the S&P 1500).\"\n\n\"In our opinion, this history does not out-weigh the inappropriateness of the comments made by the founder,\" Braeutigam wrote.\n\nAn in-house investment team will manage the money now.\n\nThe State of Michigan Retirement Systems has more than $70 billion in assets, a spokesperson confirmed to FOX Business.\n\nForbes estimates Fisher's net worth at $3.8 billion. He was at first mystified by criticism of his comments, including comparing wooing money-management clients with \"trying to get into a girl's pants,\" before apologizing last week.\n\nAlex Chalekian, the founder and CEO of advisory firm Lake Avenue Financial, attended the Tiburon conference and was the first person to go public with Fisher's remarks.\n\n\"It was a true debacle,\" Chalekian said in a video posted on Twitter on Wednesday. Fisher talked about tripping on hallucinogens, and compared money managers bragging to prospective clients with men showing their genitalia to women they're trying to pick up, Chalekian said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nFOX Business' James Langford contributed to this report.\n\nRelated Articles", "description": "Michigan Chief Investment Officer Jon Braeutigam announced the decision to withdraw $600 million of the state's pension fund from Fisher Investments.", "authors": ["Evie Fordham"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
