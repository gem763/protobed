However, he\u2019s in a pretty bad way, and Mitchell refuses to leave his side as a result.\n\nIn a special three-hander episode due to air tonight, Cleo discovers the truth about her boyfriend\u2019s affair with her best mate.\n\nOn Cleo\u2019s discovery, actress Nadine said: \u2018She obviously goes off the hook, she\u2019s like, are you having a laugh? This is not the first time this has happened to her. All she is thinking is, why does every man turn out to be gay. She absolutely loses her cool but then by the end of it she\u2019s like, do you know what, I\u2019m better than this and I deserve better than this.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Ironically, typical Hollyoaks style, Cleo and Scott are best friends, so they\u2019ve been hanging out a lot and obviously that makes it even more painful of a betrayal when Scott has been sleeping with her man.\u2019\n\nMitchell\u2019s odd behaviour raises her suspicions, and \u2014 after the truth comes out \u2014 she\u2019s shocked to hear Mitchell referring to Scott as \u2018her\u2019. He states that he was having an affair Anita Tinkle, and therefore he can\u2019t be gay \u2014 especially because of his grandfather Walter\u2019s (Trevor A Toussaint) religion.\n\nTalking about the three-hander, actor Imran Adams said: \u2018It\u2019s not just about not being able to come out because of pride or ego or image, it\u2019s because of his culture, religion, family, upbringing, and also because of a sense that he owes his grandad so much based on how much he has provided for him\u2019\n\nRoss Adams added: \u2018This is, I think, one of the most unique love stories ever told in soap history and it feels right for the show to be telling it at a time when Hollyoaks is doing such important work with our \u201cCelebrate Difference\u201d campaign\u2019\n\nNadine said: \u2018I really think the audience are going to get behind it and he\u2019s a stripper he\u2019s a womaniser he\u2019s obviously the typical handsome man so the audience may not have been expecting him to have these feelings for men, and go on a journey of figuring out his sexuality. I think once again it\u2019s going to be another really positive storyline for Hollyoaks to tackle.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to revealing the affair, the three-hander episode will focus on Cleo\u2019s exit. As a result of her having gone through something similar with Harry, she reflects on her previous relationships before ultimately deciding that she deserves better than this \u2014 a decision which leads to her departure.\n\nHollyoaks airs the special three-hander on Thursday 31stOctober at 7pm on E4.\n\nMORE: Hollyoaks spoilers: Sarah Jayne Dunn promises huge heartbreak after Darren and Nancy\u2019s secret kiss\n\nMORE: Hollyoaks spoilers: Stephanie Waring reveals Cindy Cunningham and Luke Morgan future after horror stunt\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Cleo learns the truth about Mitchell's affair with Scott \u2014 and it's this revelation that prompts her decision to leave.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image003-61b7_1572478675.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
