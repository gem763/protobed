The more stridently Trump emphasized the importance of cracking down on illegal migrants, the more emphatic the other side advocated the opposite\u2014no money for the border wall, disbanding Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ending deportations, and gutting workplace enforcement.\n\nYet, even as the other side ramps up its anti-Trump stance, in reality it has already lost.\n\nTo date, the signature act of resistance has been opposing funding border security. On Dec. 21, Congress began the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, in part over the refusal of the president\u2019s political opponents to fund the wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nRather than throw up his hands, Trump undertook a controversial effort to reprogram other appropriations to repair and expand the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nEfforts to block him in court failed. As a result, the administration now has the plan, money, resources, contracts, and land to put in place 450 miles of state-of-the-art border wall by the end of 2020.\n\nThe wall is going to happen, whether the president\u2019s opponents like it or not.\n\nAnd, the wall is going to have impact. When completed, it will cover the most heavily trafficked migrant routes across the border, making illegal border crossing significantly more difficult.\n\nIndeed, obstacles are already having an impact.\n\n\u201cThe last few months have seen a significant decline in Border Patrol arrests, thanks in part to attempts by the Trump administration to deter and discourage illegal immigration,\u201d writes David Inserra, a homeland security analyst with The Heritage Foundation.\n\nIn addition to building more wall, the administration has adopted a wave of other measures to deter and discourage illegal immigration.\n\nFor example, the Department of Homeland Security has sought to discourage abuse of asylum claims by requiring applications to be adjudicated in Mexico before the illegal immigrants enter the U.S.\n\nRecently, the government sent 5,000 individuals who had illegally crossed the border and applied for refugee status back to Mexico to await the processing of their claims. Of the 5,000, two\u2014that\u2019s right, just two\u2014were determined to have merit.\n\nThe vast majority were not real refugees, accepting bus rides back to their home countries, or they simply left on their own and didn\u2019t bother to wait for their applications to be processed.\n\nBy cracking down on meritless claims, loopholes, and abuses, even without the cooperation of Congress, the administration is sending a strong message that the U.S. means business.\n\nThe president has also been winning in the courts, where high-profile cases are increasingly turning the administration\u2019s way.\n\nRecently, for example, a Supreme Court ruling allowed the Trump administration to enforce nationwide restrictions that would prevent most Central American immigrants from seeking asylum.\n\nJust a few months ago, projections were that 1 million illegal aliens would enter the U.S. this year. That projection has already been halved. Furthermore, the administration has committed to doubling down on deporting illegal aliens.\n\nRound one to Trump.\n\nWe have proposed two legislative fixes that would dramatically reduce the immigration court backlog and prune meritless cases going forward.\n\nImmigration judges should have the ability to dismiss a case for failure to state a claim and the power to render final adjudications at the pleading stage, as we have written here before.\n\nThose two tools, which all other judges have, would reduce the backlog, which stands at almost 1 million cases, by 40% to 60%, according to experts.\n\nThe attorney general should also give immigration judges contempt authority\u2014that is, the authority to hold individuals accountable for the offense of being disobedient or disrespectful to the court\u2014so that they can more effectively manage their dockets.\n\nCongress passed a statute 22 years ago giving immigration judges contempt authority, but delegated to the attorney general the task of implementing the regulations, as we wrote here.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s victory to date is just round one. As Inserra concludes, \u201cuntil calmer heads on the left can agree that illegal immigration should be stopped, imperfect solutions are better than none at all.\u201d\n\nStill, he adds, a \u201cfar better solution would be legislation to fix these loopholes in a more permanent and measured way.\u201d\n\nTo that end, the administration has finished a draft bill that would put permanent fixes in place. The bill won\u2019t pass in this Congress because liberals control the House. But the time for choosing is coming.\n\nAmericans will have to decide if they want the next round to go to Trump and a new Congress\u2014or if they want to go the other way and embrace open borders.", "description": "If President Donald Trump is for it, his liberal opponents are against it.\u00a0\n\nNowhere is that truism more true than regarding securing the border and enforcing immigration law.", "authors": ["James Carafano", "Vice President", "Kathryn", "Shelcullom Davis Institute", "James Jay Carafano Is A Leading Expert In National Security", "Foreign Policy Challenges."], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-09/GettyImages-1169369061.jpg?itok=C4cQqURz", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
