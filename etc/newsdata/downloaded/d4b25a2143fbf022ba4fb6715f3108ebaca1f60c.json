How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. Yet sometimes, investors buy a stock for its dividend and lose money because the share price falls by more than they earned in dividend payments.\n\nA high yield and a long history of paying dividends is an appealing combination for Weyerhaeuser. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. During the year, the company also conducted a buyback equivalent to around 2.1% of its market capitalisation. Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nNYSE:WY Historical Dividend Yield, October 10th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 134% of Weyerhaeuser's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, from the perspective of an investor who hopes to own the company for many years, a payout ratio of above 100% is definitely a concern.\n\nWe also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Weyerhaeuser paid out 144% of its free cash flow last year, which we think is concerning if cash flows do not improve. Paying out more than 100% of your free cash flow in dividends is generally not a long-term, sustainable state of affairs, so we think shareholders should watch this metric closely. As Weyerhaeuser's dividend was not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we would be concerned that this dividend could be at risk over the long term.\n\nIt is worth considering that Weyerhaeuser is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). REITs have different rules governing their payments, and are often required to pay out a high portion of their earnings to investors.\n\nIs Weyerhaeuser's Balance Sheet Risky?\n\nAs Weyerhaeuser's dividend was not well covered by earnings, we need to check its balance sheet for signs of financial distress. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA is a measure of a company's total debt. Net interest cover measures the ability to meet interest payments. Essentially we check that a) the company does not have too much debt, and b) that it can afford to pay the interest. With net debt of 4.64 times its EBITDA, investors are starting to take on a meaningful amount of risk, should the business enter a downturn.\n\nNet interest cover can be calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by the company's net interest expense. Interest cover of 2.53 times its interest expense is starting to become a concern for Weyerhaeuser, and be aware that lenders may place additional restrictions on the company as well. That said, Weyerhaeuser is in the real estate business, which is typically able to sustain much higher levels of debt, relative to other industries.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Is Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE:WY) a good dividend stock?
