With such limited time, I don't think I could have done much more.\"", "description": "Despite already scoring five times this season Arsenal supporters are annoyed at the young striker's lack of starts at the Championship club", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Mark Cosgrove News Images Rex", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20716983.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Leeds-United-v-Brentford-Sky-Bet-Championship.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
