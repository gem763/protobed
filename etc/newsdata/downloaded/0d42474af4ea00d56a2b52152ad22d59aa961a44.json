That would allow him to stay at the company he built into one of the country\u2019s most valuable startups, but inject fresh leadership to pursue an IPO that would bring We the cash it needs to keep up its torrid growth.\n\nThe company burned through more than $2 billion in 2018 and analysts have projected that on its current path We will run through what it has on hand sometime next year.\n\nAny attempted coup is a gamble: Mr. Neumann still has allies among the directors and the ability to fire the entire board thanks to shares he controls that carry extra votes. But SoftBank, which has invested more than $9 billion into the company and is represented on the board, has considerable influence too, and We needs the Japanese conglomerate to continue pumping in cash.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t be learned how all of the We directors\u2014there are seven including Mr. Neumann\u2014are aligned, and the situation is fluid.\n\nshare your thoughts Will WeWork founder Adam Neumann depart, and would that be in the company\u2019s best interest? Join the conversation below.\n\nSoftBank\u2019s patience has been tested. Earlier this year, it bought shares of We at a $47 billion valuation, a level that now looks wildly overblown. As We prepared to list its shares earlier this month, the company\u2019s expected valuation had fallen to roughly a third of that.\n\nEven at that discount, We was forced to shelve the offering as criticism mounted of the company\u2019s governance and its financial losses\u2014$1.6 billion last year, and growing\u2014despite its rapid revenue growth.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last week that Mr. Neumann had taken marijuana on a flight from New York to Israel, prompting the jet\u2019s owner to recall the plane. The revelation added to concerns over Mr. Neumann\u2019s management style and transactions with the company that made him rich.\n\nWe already had made governance changes meant to win over reluctant investors. On Sept. 13 it decreased the potency of Mr. Neumann\u2019s supervoting shares\u2014still leaving him firmly in control\u2014as well as reducing his wife\u2019s role in corporate matters and reversing his controversial sale to the company of a trademark of \u201cWe.\u201d\n\nSome of SoftBank\u2019s executives have long been wary of We\u2019s soaring valuation and Mr. Neumann\u2019s unusual behavior, even as they continued to give him money. SoftBank was expected to buy as much as $1 billion in stock in We\u2019s initial public offering, a large portion of the roughly $3 billion it sought to raise from investors, people familiar with the matter said. That commitment wasn\u2019t enough to keep the listing on track, though We has pledged to get it done this year.\n\nSoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son has long been a vocal advocate of We and Mr. Neumann, who, like him, is viewed by many as a visionary. Mr. Son told CNBC in March he still wanted to invest more in the company despite the misgivings of some of his own investors. SoftBank has invested in We directly and through the Vision Fund, a $100 billion pool it raised in 2017.\n\nThe Vision Fund\u2019s $4.4 billion investment in 2017 valued We at about $20 billion. When the fund\u2019s biggest investors, a pair of Middle Eastern governments, balked last year at investing more, SoftBank itself stepped in, committing $4 billion at a $47 billion valuation.\n\nMr. Neumann wouldn\u2019t be the first startup founder forced out by controversy. Uber Technologies Inc. \u2019s Travis Kalanick was pushed out by his board in 2017 after the ride-hailing company was widely criticized for a chauvinistic and toxic work culture. Uber went public this spring with a new chief executive brought in from the outside.\n\nWrite to Maureen Farrell at maureen.farrell@wsj.com, Liz Hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.com, Eliot Brown at eliot.brown@wsj.com and David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com", "description": "A bloc of WeWork directors is planning to push Adam Neumann to step down as chief executive after a tumultuous week in which the startup delayed its IPO.", "authors": ["Maureen Farrell", "Liz Hoffman", "Eliot Brown", "David Benoit", "Maureen.Farrell Wsj.Com", "Liz.Hoffman Wsj.Com", "Eliot.Brown Wsj.Com", "David.Benoit Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109662/social", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
