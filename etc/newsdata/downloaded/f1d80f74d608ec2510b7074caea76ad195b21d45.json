He concluded: \u201cThese white Democratic defectors express a profound distaste for blacks, a sentiment that pervades almost everything they think about government and politics.\u201d\n\nThe Many Lives of Michael Bloomberg review: not quite a presidential read Read more\n\nA supporter of Robert Kennedy in 1968, Greenberg saw class, not race, as the lever of choice in wooing Democratic voters. A quarter-century later, he was Bill Clinton\u2019s pollster in his victorious 1992 presidential bid.\n\nNow Greenberg delivers RIP GOP, in which he predicts that the rage engendered by Donald Trump will lead to his defeat in 2020, Democratic control of the Senate and the collapse of the current Republican party. Imagine the past midterms on steroids.\n\nAn illustration of a dead elephant lying on a mound of dirt, all four legs skyward, graces Greenberg\u2019s cover. Apparently, the author is less interested in unifying the US than in forging durable coalitions. Think math, not therapy. It\u2019s about 50% +1.\n\nThe book is methodically and meticulously researched. It portrays an America where white voters without a four-year degree remain nearly a majority and suburbia is home to half of the population. A country grown less worshipful and more diverse. We really do live in a bubbling cauldron of contradictions and countervailing forces.\n\nIn Greenberg\u2019s telling, a galvanized Democratic party led by minorities, single women, younger voters and women with degrees will upend a decade of Republican ascendance built on the Koch brothers\u2019 money, hostility toward modernity, racial resentment and nativism. It\u2019s a bold prediction, even if Trump\u2019s approval ratings are underwater and the GOP is scrapping primaries to avoid embarrassing their guy.\n\nFirst, presidents seldom lose re-election, and unlike Bush 41, Trump is not mired in a recession. Inverted yield curves are not the same as actual negative growth or mass unemployment.\n\nSecond, Greenberg is betting progressive economics tethered to multiculturalism will not cost the Democrats the White House, a wager open to debate if the latest polling from Wisconsin, a state Trump won, is reflective of the state of play.\n\nIn the Badger state, Joe Biden, an establishment liberal with a marked following among older voters and African Americans, is the only Democrat holding a solid lead (nine points) over the president. Elizabeth Warren, whose kind words grace RIP GOP\u2019s jacket, is in a dead heat with Trump. Reminiscent of 2016, she and the president are both weighed down by negatives.\n\nGreenberg is betting progressive economics tethered to multiculturalism will not cost the Democrats the White House\n\nA full-throated progressive, Warren has called for decriminalizing US immigration policy, which puts her at odds with Biden and most of the US. A plurality of Democrats and nearly two-thirds of Americans disagree with Massachusetts\u2019 senior senator.\n\nLooking at Brexit and immigration, Greenberg acknowledges that he has long been \u201ccritical of center-left parties for not showing that managing immigration was first principle and not showing that they would prioritize citizens over non-citizens\u201d.\n\nAs part of his examination of the topic, Greenberg refers to the 15th amendment of the constitution as the legal foundation for \u201cbirthright citizenship\u201d, by which those born within the US are automatically deemed to be citizens. Here Greenberg errs. That rule is enshrined in the 14th amendment, which secures equal protection and due process. The 15th amendment guaranties the voting rights of former slaves.\n\nIf history is a guide, the embrace of identity politics results in pushback. Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat was not just about having a tin ear to economic anxiety or income stagnation, a source of finger-pointing by Greenberg. Nor was it solely due to Trump\u2019s race-baiting.\n\nClinton\u2019s loss also stemmed from her worship at the altars of multiculturalism and political correctness. Showcasing Lesley McSpadden, mother of the late Michael Brown, at the Democratic convention may have been too much for too many after police were gunned down in Dallas and Baton Rouge earlier that July.\n\nThe concerns and interests of middle-aged suburbia do not necessarily line up with those of the Squad or Bernie Sanders\n\nTrump fell into a similar trap. He persisted in harping on grievances, real and imagined, long after taking the oath of office. He continued to demonize minorities and migrants and made no attempt to reach to the center. Charlottesville and Pittsburgh indelibly stain his already toxic legacy.\n\nFurthermore, bashing Colin Kaepernick hurt more than it helped in suburbia and swing districts. In those precincts, the public turned a deaf ear as the president kept on yammering about caravans and gangs.\n\nGreenberg is optimistic that if the Democrats win they will be able to press for a more activist government. To a point.\n\nThe concerns and interests of middle-aged suburbia do not necessarily line up with those of the Squad or Bernie Sanders. Culture counts. If the midterms taught us anything, it is that imposing a check upon an untethered president should not be equated with a desire for a revolution or turning the US on its head.\n\nCall Sign Chaos review: James Mattis pulls a flanking manuever on Trump Read more\n\nPreserving the social safety net is different from unbridled government expansion. Safeguarding social security, Medicare, Medicaid and Obamacare brings a larger constituency than stripping people of private insurance for the sake of single-payer healthcare. If the Democrats succeed as Greenberg predicts, they will do so by bringing some Republicans along for the ride, by definition a moderating action and influence.\n\nHaving been stung by the effective abolition of the deductibility of state and local taxes, wealthier coastal voters will also likely be resistant to a potpourri of costly initiatives. Infrastructure is one thing. The Green New Deal is probably something else.\n\nTrade is another issue that may pit Democrats against each other. Although Greenberg has long sounded the klaxon concerning the impact of trade on America\u2019s vulnerable, Trump\u2019s embrace of protectionism has made free trade popular among Democrats.\n\nTrumpism won\u2019t be disappearing anytime soon. Rural Americans and evangelicals will not stop making themselves heard. Calls to blood and soil will continue. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s minions endeavor to enshrine a dynasty.
