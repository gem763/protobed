He cares about moments, images and monuments. He wants to be able to plaster his name across any big, important thing, stand proudly before it and take credit.\n\nThis is the same Trump who responded to the case of the Central Park Five by taking out newspaper advertisements calling for New York State to adopt the death penalty . The black and Latino boys were just teenagers at the time, and he refused to apologize or change his position on their guilt even after they were exonerated.\n\nHe consistently gushes over the morally abhorrent and dramatically racially skewed Stop-And-Frisk program in New York City. At its height, hundreds of thousands of people \u2014 mostly young black and Latino men \u2014 were being caught in this dragnet, many being stopped and frisked multiple times for no reason other than the hue of their skin, texture of their hair and ZIP code of their home.\n\nIn 2013, a federal judge ruled New York\u2019s way of using Stop and Frisk unconstitutional because it was a \u201cpolicy of indirect racial profiling.\u201d In the last lines of her 195-page decision the judge quoted one of my columns:\n\n\u201cThe idea of universal suspicion without individual evidence is what Americans find abhorrent and what black men in America must constantly fight. It is pervasive in policing policies \u2014 like stop-and-frisk, and \u2026 neighborhood watch \u2014 regardless of the collateral damage done to the majority of innocents. It\u2019s like burning down a house to rid it of mice.\u201d", "description": "He was honored on the issue of criminal justice, where his record is shameful.", "authors": ["Charles M.
