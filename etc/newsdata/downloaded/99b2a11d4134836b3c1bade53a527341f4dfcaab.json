Mrwebi lodged his representation with the committee, but Jiba opted not to do this and instead started the court proceedings.\n\nNjikela said, in his opinion, it was a \"bit unwise\" on Jiba's part to not make a representation to the committee.\n\nHe added it was up to the committee to decide whether or not it would give her another opportunity to do so.\n\nANC MPs Hishaam Mohamed and Jacqueline Mofokeng said to protect the integrity of the parliamentary process, they did not think Jiba needed another opportunity to make representations.\n\n\"This is not only about her, it is also about the citizens of South Africa,\" Mofokeng said.\n\nThe committee, however, decided to allow her to make representations in the interests of fairness. Jiba must do so within seven calendar days once she received the letter from the committee. The letter will also make it clear that this would be her final chance.\n\nCommittee chairperson Bulelani Magwanishe said they must conclude the matter before Parliament goes on recess on December 4.", "description": "Nomgcobo Jiba will have seven days to convince the portfolio committee on justice and correctional services to reinstate her as deputy national director of public prosecutions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8662/eea3c18be0444c35b4878135b014adde.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
