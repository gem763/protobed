Premier League Team of the Week (September 14-15) 1/12 Premier League Team of the Week: September 14-15 Getty Images 2/12 David de Gea, Manchester United De Gea has come under a lot of criticism in recent times, but was very impressive against Leicester making good stops to deny James Maddison and Ben Chilwell. Getty Images 3/12 Serge Aurier, Tottenham Aurier is another player who has received his fair share of criticism, but was at his best against Palace, with his low cross forcing an own goal from Patrick van Aanoholt. Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty I 4/12 Ibrahim Amadou (top centre), Norwich Though Norwich conceded twice, Amadou was outstanding against Manchester City particularly in the second half. Naturally a defensive midfielder, Amadou was very solid alongside Ben Godfrey for the Canaries. Getty Images 5/12 Nathan Ake, Bournemouth It was not surprising to hear Ake\u2019s name linked with a big money move in the summer - the Dutchman has an appetite for defending and displayed this in buckets against Everton. Getty Images 6/12 Andrew Robertson, Liverpool Robertson has not yet reached the level he was operating at last season, but against Newcastle he was very close. His piece of play to set up Mane for Liverpool\u2019s first goal was brilliant, and was his first assist of the season. Getty Images 7/12 Etienne Capoue, Watford Although Deulofeu was very good, captain Capoue was outstanding against Arsenal. The Frenchman dominated Arsenal\u2019s midfield, nullifying the threats of Dani Ceballos and Mesut Ozil. Arsenal FC via Getty Images 8/12 Scott McTominay, Manchester United United\u2019s midfield has been far from solid this season, but against Leicester McTominay put on his best performance of the season. He was aggressive in midfield and moved the ball well, reminiscent of Ander Herrera at his best. Manchester United via Getty Images 9/12 Emiliano Buendia, Norwich The diminutive Argentinian was fantastic against City, operating across the midfield with flicks, tricks and incisive passes causing havoc. Buendia was also defensively outstanding throughout. Getty Images 10/12 Son Heung-min, Tottenham Spurs are at their best when Son plays, and this was proved against Palace. His two goals demonstrated his skill, movement and fantastic two-footed ability. Getty Images 11/12 Sadio Mane, Liverpool Mohammed Salah\u2019s place as the main man at Anfield is increasingly under threat, as Mane once again put in a brilliant performance and scored a brilliant goal in Liverpool\u2019s win over Newcastle. His brace means that he is the only player since the start of last season to score 25+ non-penalty goals. AFP/Getty Images 12/12 Tammy Abraham, Chelsea With hattrick of goals that were all different in their own right, Abraham was unstoppable against Wolves. The pace and skill displayed for his third goal was particularly impressive given his size.

We all said that can\u2019t be happening out on the pitch.\u201d\n\nNewcastle\u2019s Kieron Dyer and Lee Bowyer were infamously dismissed after a scrap in a game against Villa in 2005.\n\nAnd while this incident did not escalate to the level of that particularly heated fracas, the Villa players would have had a nervy moment while the clash was checked.\n\nManager Dean Smith praised his players for their professionalism in taking charge and dealing with the incident quickly.\n\n\u201cThat is the group of players I have got,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThere is a great togetherness in the dressing room, with a great team spirit. It went over the edge of what we want.\n\n\u201cBut the players dealt with it swiftly and I am happy for them to do that. We are playing a team sport. It is competitive and there will be heat-of-the-moment things that happen.\n\n\u201cI expect players to take responsibility. There is a limit you can\u2019t step over. We\u2019ve got a really good leadership group and they sort that out themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have stopped trying to work out what the officials\u2019 decisions will be,\u201d he said when asked if he was concerned El Ghazi might be sent off.\n\n\u201cAnwar has a little bit of red mist in him, like most professional footballers. It is one of those things.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think of taking him off. That is the end of it. It won\u2019t get brought up again.\u201d\n\nWest Ham lost Arthur Masukaku in the second half of the game at Villa Park with the left-back dismissed for a second bookable offence, but secured an away point, though Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s side missed out on a chance to move into the top three of the English Premier League table.\n\nIt was, otherwise, a game rather lacking in inspiration and event, with little in the way of goalmouth action, and neither goalkeeper tested particularly strenuously.\n\nThe point takes Aston Villa out of the relegation zone.", "description": "Aston Villa captain Jack Grealish has said that Anwar El Ghazi and Tyrone Mings have \u201cput to bed\u201d their bizarre clash in the first half of Villa\u2019s 0-0 draw with West Ham. Mings and El Ghazi squared up after the centre back expressed his displeasure at the Dutchman\u2019s failure to track back on the left, with El Ghazi appearing to move his head towards Mings\u2019 as they nearly came", "authors": ["Harry Latham-Coyle"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/17/07/mings-el-ghazi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
