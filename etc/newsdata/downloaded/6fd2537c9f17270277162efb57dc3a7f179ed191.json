We\u2019re de\ufb01nitely seeing a Bond who\u2019s more in touch with his feelings and more open to falling in love,\u2019 she continued.\n\n\u2018At the end of Spectre there are women he gives his career up for: there\u2019s no more emotional attachment than that. It\u2019s just about moving with the times and recognising that women can no longer be seen as eye candy.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
