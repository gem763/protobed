But, in the dark of the night, they are becoming more and more subject to vicious attacks launched by modern-day pirates.\n\n\u201cAlthough oil and diesel stealing has been going on for decades, there has been an increase in criminal activity reported in the last four years,\u201d Johan Obdola, founder of the Global Organization for Security and Intelligence, told Fox News. \u201cIt is estimated that the stealing in Mexico is up to 1.18 million barrels a day, bringing millions to criminal organizations, and making it very difficult to control.\u201d\n\nAnd, controlling the matter is convoluted by the notion that little is known about the exact network of pirates who are believed to have been born out of local fisherman circles. Even corrupt government workers themselves have aided some of the piracy, experts have asserted.\n\nSince he took office in December 2018, President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador vowed to make oil theft a top national-security priority. This past January, officials shut down several Mexican Petroleum (Pemex) pipelines in an attempt to curb the smuggling and piracy, but the shortage triggered a schism among the oil-hungry cartels and a national deficit that angered people across that country.\n\nCRUELTY OF EL CHAPO'S SINALOA CARTEL KNOWS NO BOUNDS: BEHEADINGS BY CHAINSAW, BODY PARTS STREWN IN THE STREETS\n\nObrador also declared that the Navy would maintain perpetual surveillance of off-the-coast operations to protect against piracy. But, many analysts have contended that the problem only has worsened. According to the Maritime Herald, pirate robbery, aggression, and looting \u2013 including boats and marine thieves \u2013 rose some 310 percent in 2018, and experts say it has continued to rise.\n\nMuch of the piracy has been focused on offshore platforms operated by Pemex \u2013 Mexico\u2019s state-owned oil company \u2013 resulting in massive losses reaching $1 billion in revenue annually.\n\nSome officials have argued the modern-day piracy took on a life of its own around six years ago with the \u201cenergy reform\u201d that sought to privatize some of the country\u2019s oil industry and take away some of the substantial debt that Pemex was accruing.\n\nIn August 2014, Mexico implemented an overhauled energy reform policy \u2013 with controversial constitutional amendments designed to end the longstanding and entrenched state monopolies in its energy sector.\n\n\u201cMexico's energy reform to allow for privatization became law back in August of 2014. This has taken the full control and corruption capabilities away from Pemex. For the past eight decades, Pemex has had full control of this mighty cash cow. The consumers had no different outlets than the Pemex gas station,\u201d explained Lee Oughton, the managing partner and chief operating officer of the Mexico City-based Fortress risk-management company.\n\nBut, the private enterprise has also meant pirates and other illicit players would have more in which to meddle. The opening of the oil market has brought with it dozens of leading conglomerates to Mexico \u2013 and hundreds of active platforms \u2013 which have lacked security and remained vulnerable to intrusion, security analysts said.\n\nOver the past two years, the country's navy has fielded more than 300 reports about the stealing of hydrocarbons in oil tankers and other critical equipment and machinery, ranging from pipework and communication equipment to cash, motors, and aluminum.\n\n\u201cSea pirates aren\u2019t always looking for oil, often what they want is this equipment to sell on the black market,\u201d one Mexican ex-intelligence official explained.\n\nInvestigators also have documented numerous cases of pirates ambushing oil ships in Mexican seas and making illicit fuel transfers between ships, as well as boarding platforms and threatening personnel to complete robberies.\n\nPirates often have been disguised as fishermen, or as Mexican law enforcement or officials when boarding the platforms.\n\nDespite the deployment of maritime surveillance ranging from ocean patrols to helicopters to interceptors, the rampant piracy has proven to be a steep challenge to squash. Sporadic spouts of severe violence have brought some attention to the piracy issue in recent years, and there's been no shortage of terrifying examples of pirates at play.\n\nIn 2010, American tourist David Hartley was out with his wife on Falcon Lake \u2013 part of the Rio Grande, a lengthy body of water hedging the United States and Mexico waters, when attackers dressed as Mexican police on fishing boats shot and killed him. It marked a string of several Mexican pirate attacks amid the international reservoir.\n\nIn April, Mexico Daily News reported that pirates locked up the crew of an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico as they set about searching for anything of value. Over six hours later, as many as six pirates finally left and the rig\u2019s captain was able to issue an emergency alert.\n\nEarlier this month, grainy cellphone footage emerged showing Mexican pirates boarding a vacation riverboat demanding money and possessions from passengers at gunpoint. Police said it wasn\u2019t the first time such an incident had taken place.\n\nBut, sea pirates have been only one part of the fuel embezzling crisis. The public and the now-growing number of private oil companies operating in Mexico have had to contend with the huachicoleros -- people dedicated to stealing fuel and other commodities.\n\n\u201cRun very similarly like a cartel, with again the local communities supporting this group due to the availability to use cheaper fuel than filling up at the local gas stations. Some of their current strongholds are in the areas of Guanajuato, Hidalgo, Puebla, and Veracruz,\u201d Oughton said. He added that when the new government came in, \u201cthe president sent around 5,000 troops to protect the pipelines from the huachicoleros. This initiative backfired [and was blamed for] an apparent fuel shortage... in January 2019. This was a smokescreen to lay blame at this group's feet and take away the... responsibility from their incompetence and inability to control these bad actors.\u201d\n\nThe organized crime syndicate is reported to have stolen upwards of 14.5 million liquid gallons annually. Much of the criminal activity has taken place in a notoriously lawless patch known as the Red Triangle, stretching from Tepeaca, Palmar de Bravo and Quecholac to Acatzingo, Acajete and Tecamachalco.\n\n\u201cThis is an enterprise creeping towards the billions. The illegal fuel sales have been an added avenue for the cartels to make money. The huachicoleros seem to be the named criminal entity to control the market. That being said, cartels have controlled the majority of the communities for years,\u201d Oughton said. \u201cThis would suggest that there is a collaboration or synergies between these groups.\u201d\n\nMore than 600 illegal pipeline taps, according to Pemex data, was recorded in the first six months of the year alone.\n\n\u201cWhole communities support it and go in and buy it directly because oil is expensive in Mexico,\u201d one official explained. \u201cThey offer cheaper gas than the stations; they donate stolen fuel to those in need; they offer barrels as prayer offerings.\u201d\n\nINSIDE VENEZUELA\u2019S TORTUROUS INTELLIGENCE AND DRUG-RUNNING BRANCH SEBIN\n\nHowever, whole communities have suffered steeply from the associated violence. The fuel industry has ignited its own deep-seated war without frontlines and sandbags, just a nagging feeling of sinister uncertainty. Huachicoleros frequently have confronted police and military.\n\nThe oil-industry city of Coatzacoalcos in the Gulf state of Veracruz was hammered in August with a particularly harrowing violent spate, in which suspected members of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel blocked the exits at the Caballo Blanco nightclub and proceeded to set the room ablaze \u2013 killing some 28 people trapped inside. The attack allegedly was motivated by the notion that the club owner either had traded drugs from a rival gang or refused to make extortion payments.\n\nScores have been murdered or \u201cdisappeared\u201d in the region in recent years, with little justice for their mourning families.\n\nGuanajuato also has emerged as a combustion site for the fruitful criminal oil economy, dominated by the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel, which was subject to a government crackdown in July of this year as the country\u2019s financial intelligence unit froze almost $2 million in bank accounts connected to the oil-centric group.\n\nMoreover, in January of this year, a pipeline explosion killed at least 91 people in the central Mexican state of Hidalgo. Allegations of illegal taps on the highly-pressurized system soon emerged. In addition, static electricity from the clothing of people around the pipeline contributed to the blast, preliminary findings showed.\n\nAccording to Obdola, oil revenues have become an increasingly fortune-amassing component of several cartels \u2013 ranging from the Gulf Cartel and the Zetas to New Generation and Sinaloa, once helmed by Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n.\n\nThe fragility of justice also has played a prominent role in the ongoing violence, with some 90 percent of crime and homicides going unpunished, according to think tank Zero Impunity.\n\nMexican officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity told Fox News that the piracy and oil-stealing issues were one of three main causes of concern, along with human trafficking and weapons trafficking.\n\nSome official estimates contended that only 60 percent of the country's oil was distributed legally to the state-operated gas stations, with the other 40 percent channeled through illicit means. One intelligence official surmised that cartels with connections to the pirates and oil thieves even have operated entire gas stations with their illicitly extracted goods.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nA portion is believed to leak back into the U.S. black market, too.\n\n\u201cBut, the U.S. probably isn\u2019t the biggest end consumer. The majority of the stolen oil would be utilized locally, also moving to Venezuela and Colombia in the Latin America region,\u201d Oughton added, \u201ceven potentially going as far afield as China and the surrounding region.\u201d", "description": "Gulf drilling platforms are becoming more and more subject to vicious attacks launched by modern-day pirates.", "authors": ["Hollie Mckay", "Hollie Mckay Has A Been A Fox News Digital Staff Reporter Since She Has Extensively Reported War Zones Including Iraq", "Syria", "Yemen", "Afghanistan", "Pakistan", "Burma", "Latin America Investigates Global Conflicts", "War Crimes", "Terrorism Around The World.
