(Leah Newsom/Leah Newsom)\n\nMary Rambaran-Olm hates drama.\n\nSo, in one of the most dramatic moments of her life \u2014 as she took the podium at an academic conference to resign from a prestigious medieval studies group over its alleged racism, sexism and ties to white supremacy \u2014 she kept things simple. She wasn\u2019t nervous, she didn\u2019t tremble; she didn\u2019t even bother to prepare notes.\n\nFacing several hundred people in an auditorium in downtown Washington this month, Rambaran-Olm spoke for less than a minute: The International Society of Anglo-Saxonists (ISAS) was encouraging and emboldening white supremacists, she said, an attitude typified by its refusal to change its name. Rambaran-Olm, a woman of color, was stepping down as the group\u2019s second vice president, effective immediately.\n\n\u201cI just said what I had to say,\u201d Rambaran-Olm, a 41-year-old academic researcher who lives in Ireland, said later. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand at the time what ripple effect it was going to have \u2014 I didn\u2019t think it was going to snowball.\u201d\n\nSnowball it did.\n\n[The accused New Zealand shooter and an all-white Europe that never existed]\n\nOn Tuesday, following multiple resignations and outraged statements from other medieval groups condemning its actions, ISAS formally voted to alter its name, bowing to critics who argue that \u201cAnglo Saxon\u201d is code for whiteness, a phrase that is co-opted today by white supremacists around the world to advance a false version of white-dominated history.\n\nIt was a landmark moment for the group and for medieval studies. ISAS, one of the largest and longest-standing scholarly associations in the field, holds a highly regarded conference every two years that attracts scholars across the globe. Presenting at the event as a young scholar is \u201ca huge deal\u201d that can make your career, according to Erik Wade, a visiting lecturer at the University of Bonn who studies Old English literature and history.\n\nBut the battle over the term \u201cAnglo Saxon\u201d has implications beyond ISAS: It\u2019s emblematic of broader issues roiling the world of medieval studies, Wade said. Over the past two weeks, Rambaran-Olm\u2019s actions have forced the field into a contentious debate about the ways its past and present scholarship may reinforce white supremacy, a reckoning some are hailing as long overdue.\n\n\u201cThe name change encapsulates a much larger issue of how medieval studies must wrestle with its own disciplinary history of racism and its connections to whiteness,\u201d Wade said. \u201cWhen something as small as changing an organization\u2019s name generates this kind of pushback, that suggests how entrenched these hierarchies are.\u201d\n\nAbout 75 percent of ISAS\u2019s 582 members participated in the vote to change the group\u2019s name, and the motion passed with a roughly 60 percent majority, according to an email obtained by The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cThere will of course follow a process for suggesting, discussing, and selecting a new name,\u201d former ISAS executive director Robin Norris wrote in the email. \u201cWe apologize to our colleagues of color who have experienced the name of our society as just one of many microaggressions they have faced in academia.\u201d\n\nThe switch came too late for some, and too soon for others. In the wake of Rambaran-Olm\u2019s speech, ISAS suffered a steady drip of resignations from rank-and-file members and top leadership on both sides of the issue. Its advisory board of nine is down to just four.\n\nISAS president Timothy Graham declined to comment, and Norris did not respond to a request for comment. Rory Naismith, an ex officio member of the ISAS Advisory Board, said Wednesday that the group is working to formulate \u201ca collective written statement\u201d on the matter.\n\nIn her email to ISAS members, Norris said the board was saddened by all the resignations and admitted: \u201cWe made you wait too long for change.\u201d\n\n\u201cMary\u2019s resignation has raised difficult questions that will require a longer process of self-reckoning and evaluation on the part of the Society \u2026 the board pledges to effect changes,\u201d Norris wrote. She concluded the message with the first of those changes: \u201cWith that, I resign as your Executive Director.\u201d\n\nRambaran-Olm said she thinks ISAS is \u201ctaking a good first step\u201d by changing its name. But much more must be done \u2014 and much more is at stake, she said.\n\nIt was never just about a name, said Eileen Fradenburg Joy, a scholar in the field and a former ISAS member.\n\n\u201cThe entire field of medieval studies is undergoing massive upheaval because they have not dealt with long-standing issues of racism and sexism,\u201d Joy said. \u201cThis name change controversy is sowing the fault lines that still exist between white scholars \u2014 because it\u2019s all white people, a bunch of white people arguing over whether they\u2019re racist.\u201d\n\n[Islamophobes want to recreate the Crusades. But they don't understand them at all.]\n\nThe discipline of medieval studies \u2014 which is overwhelmingly white \u2014 focuses on literature, art and culture produced between roughly A.D. 500 and 1500 in England. Key texts studied include \u201cBeowulf\u201d and Geoffrey Chaucer\u2019s \u201cThe Canterbury Tales.\u201d\n\nWhite supremacists have recently sought to revive this period of history as proof of white racial superiority, pointing in part to the era\u2019s literary achievements as evidence that white society was far ahead of other cultures, according to Wade. They also see it as a time \u201cof pure masculinity, some sort of warrior culture where men could be men,\u201d Wade said.\n\nMedieval symbols and references to historians of that era have cropped up at white nationalist and neo-Nazi rallies, including the deadly 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. The gunman suspected in the 2019 New Zealand shooting that left 51 dead scrawled 18 references to the Middle Ages on his weaponry, according to medieval historian Paul B. Sturtevant.\n\nThe term \u201cAnglo Saxon\u201d has come to symbolize this particular vision of white medieval dominance, Wade said \u2014 a vision that is completely wrong for several reasons.\n\nFirst of all, it was not a \u201cmonolithic white period\u201d: People immigrated to England from all over (including places like Greece and North Africa), and would not have described themselves as \u201cAnglo Saxon\u201d at the time, said Wade, who resigned as a member of ISAS this week to show support for Rambaran-Olm.\n\nSecond, Wade said, people living in the region were not the insular and self-important bunch that white supremacists want them to be. The English did not \u201cthink of themselves as the center of the world,\u201d according to Wade, and in fact looked to other societies for inspiration and education.\n\nSome of the most revered medieval texts draw heavily on literature produced by Spanish monks. Many in England were \u201ctotally obsessed\u201d with travelogues about India and Egypt, Wade said. One prominent English king modeled currency on coins produced in Islam and even wrote to people in the Arab Empire asking for medical advice.\n\n[The next antibiotics could come from the Dark Ages]\n\n\u201cThis idea that they were not influenced by North Africa or the Middle East, all of these places, is just ridiculous,\u201d Wade said. \u201cThey\u2019re really, really trying to model themselves on this other part of the world.\u201d\n\nThe false historical narrative that white people \u2014 in particular, Anglo Saxon people \u2014 were the only race to produce worthwhile literature, art and scientific discoveries during the Middle Ages took root when \u201cprofessional medieval studies\u201d launched in Britain in the late 1700s, according to Wade. At the time, the British Empire wanted to justify its colonization of other countries around the globe, so it was \u201cpolitically convenient\u201d to develop a view that the English had \u201calways been superior,\u201d Wade said.\n\nThat way of thinking became entrenched as the field developed, according to Wade, and still shapes the discipline today \u2014 informing who gets hired, who gets published, who gets tenure.\n\n\u201cThis field \u2026 it\u2019s just incredibly self-satisfied, smug, elitist, white and male,\u201d Joy said.\n\nRambaran-Olm didn\u2019t know all this when she chose to pursue a career in medieval studies. She just knew she\u2019d fallen in love with the subject.\n\nHer admiration began during childhood in Canada, when her father (a \u201chuge Middle Ages fan\u201d) introduced her to literary figures such as Robin Hood. Her passion was confirmed in college when she discovered \u201cBeowulf.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was just fascinated with Old English, this language that seemed so foreign but it was our language, my language,\u201d Rambaran-Olm said. \u201cI thought that medieval studies was something for me, too \u2014 until I found out that clearly it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nProfessors and advisers made Rambaran-Olm feel alien and unwelcome countless times over the years, she said. Turning her down for a job, someone told her, \u201cWe couldn\u2019t figure out how to justify to our students that you are an Anglo-Saxonist.\u201d Teachers consistently professed amazement that she was interested in the field.\n\nStill, she stuck with it, determined not to become one of the countless \u201cpeople of color who leave silently,\u201d she said. She joined ISAS in 2005 and, when the opportunity arose in 2017 to serve as second vice president, she jumped at it.\n\nThe organization is highly prestigious among medieval scholars (\u201ca huge deal,\u201d Wade said), so it was a possible boon to her career. More than that, Rambaran-Olm thought she could push for change from within, using her position of power for good.\n\n[Five myths about the Middle Ages]\n\n\u201cI was hoping I could reach not just the organization but work to make changes within our field, because our field is just laden with so many problems,\u201d Rambaran-Olm said. \u201cToo many people have left because of racism and sexism. \u2026 I\u2019m one of the only people of color in the field.\u201d\n\nIn her new role, she immediately began seeking to reform ISAS. She fought to introduce a sexual harassment policy and to \u201cdismantle racism within the organization\u201d by making it more inclusive of people of color, she said. Of course, she also pushed for a name change.\n\nFor two years, every change Rambaran-Olm proposed met with \u201cendless and total stonewalling\u201d from ISAS\u2019s board, she said. This month, following yet another disappointing board meeting, she decided she\u2019d had enough.\n\nIn the hours before the Washington conference on Sept. 7, she called her mother and various academic advisers to talk through her plans to quit. Everyone agreed: It simply \u201cwasn\u2019t worth it\u201d anymore. She did not want to do hard, lonely and pointless battle with the board for years to come.\n\nISAS\u2019s vote this week hasn\u2019t changed Rambaran-Olm\u2019s mind. She has no wish to rejoin the group, she said, no matter what it\u2019s called.\n\nBut she\u2019s not giving up on medieval studies.\n\n\u201cI have a number of articles and two books in the works,\u201d Rambaran-Olm said. \u201cI just think \u2014 well, there are things to say, and if people are willing to publish it, I\u2019m going to say them.\u201d", "description": "The battle over the word \u201cAnglo Saxon\u201d has implications beyond the group formerly known as the International Society of Anglo-Saxonists.", "authors": ["Hannah Natanson", "Reporter Covering Social Issues In The D.C.
