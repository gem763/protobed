But that prosperity has accumulated mostly in the hands of a lucky few. As a result, Chile has one of the highest levels of economic inequality in the developed world.\n\nNow that inequality is threatening the country\u2019s stability. Santiago, the capital and largest city, has been convulsed by protests that were sparked by an increase in subway fares but that have become an expression of broader grievances: against the poor quality of public health care and education; against low wages and the rising cost of living; against the meager pensions that Chileans receive in old age.\n\nSebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, the billionaire elected president in 201 7, has responded with belligerence, declaring the Chilean government \u201cat war\u201d with the protesters, whom he has described as organized criminals and, worse, as enemies of the state.\n\nProtesters have burned buildings and subway stations and engaged in looting \u2014 behavior that is undoubtedly criminal and reprehensible \u2014 but it would be a mistake to seize on that misconduct as an excuse for ignoring the grievances of the protesters, a large majority of whom are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their democratic rights.", "description": "Protesters are demanding a larger share of the nation\u2019s prosperity \u2014 a reality check for its celebrated economic model.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/opinion/22chileprotestNew/22chileprotestNew-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
