But the protests aren\u2019t over and aren\u2019t the only crisis facing Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\nXi has controlled all levers of Chinese power for over a half-decade, ruling with an iron fist. He is simultaneously general secretary of the Communist Party, president of China and chairman of the Central Military Commission.\n\nYet the Chinese leader has never faced anything like the multiple high-profile challenges he must currently deal with \u2013 and it\u2019s not at all clear he knows how to manage them.\n\nJOHN YOO: TRUMP IS MAKING A BIG MISTAKE ON HONG KONG \u2013 HERE\u2019S WHAT HE SHOULD DO TO SUPPORT PROTESTERS\n\nXi has major problems on two fronts: a costly trade dispute with the U.S. and the mass protests in Hong Kong.\n\nThe back and forth on trade includes billions of dollars in tariffs levied by the Trump administration on imports from China, and billions of dollars in tariffs levied by China on imports from the U.S.\n\nBoth nations \u2013 which have the two largest economies in the world \u2013 are suffering as a result.\n\nPresident Trump is seeking major changes in the way China does business with U.S. companies, a halt to China\u2019s violations of the norms of international trade, and an end China\u2019s theft of intellectual property. Getting these things would be a major victory for Trump, but Xi shows no sign of giving in to all of Trump\u2019s demands.\n\nXi\u2019s problem in Hong Kong involves protests that have brought hundreds of thousands of demonstrators \u2013 as many as 2 million by some estimates \u2013 into the streets of the former British colony, which was returned to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nThe Hong Kong protests have caused major disruptions in the functioning of the city of 7.4 million that is a major world financial center.\n\nThe Hong Kong crisis might be more manageable than the trade war \u2013 if only because Xi seems to give not one whit about the people of Hong Kong.\n\nXi might well be willing to let chaotic events roil the city. After all, doing this could encourage investments to flow to more \u201cstable\u201d places on the mainland that are firmly under the government\u2019s thumb.\n\nAnd there is little danger that the city\u2019s democracy protests will spread to the mainland. The government has succeeded in whipping up criticism of the protesters both domestically and among the diaspora overseas.\n\nMeanwhile, Xi seems content to manage the crisis in Hong Kong by remote control.\n\nNews reports that Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam would step down if the Chinese authorities would permit it ring true, as do her denials that she ever asked. Beijing would assuredly have rejected the offer; it is happy to keep a Hong Kong face on the repression.\n\nBeijing is also happy to keep giving peeks at the ace up its sleeve. Recently, its Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office released a statement that simply quoted the Basic Law that governs China\u2019s oversight of Hong Kong. It gives Beijing the option of taking action, unrequested by Hong Kong, in the event of an emergency.\n\nThe Chinese have this figured out. They just need to drop hints and restate provisions of law \u2013and let the international media do the job of intimidating protesters. As long as the demonstrations don\u2019t spread to the mainland, Xi will not likely step in; he\u2019ll just continue to not so subtlety remind Hong Kong where the real power lies.\n\nXi looks like the passenger in an out-of-control elevator \u2013 smashing all the buttons in the hope one of them does something.\n\nStill, the question remains: How to resolve the protests in Hong Kong? And the answer seems no clearer in Beijing than it does on the streets of Hong Kong.\n\nLam\u2019s announcement Wednesday that she is withdrawing the proposed extradition law that sparked the Hong Kong protests won\u2019t placate all the protesters, but many will likely leave the streets. That will enable the Hong Kong police to breathe a bit easier.\n\nStill, Hong Kong protesters said on social media Wednesday that they will continue demonstrating until their four other demands are met: an independent investigation of how police have responded to the protests; amnesty for protesters who were arrested; a popular vote to elect the chief executive and legislators; and an end to the government claim that people at a June 12 protest were \u201crioters.\u201d\n\nThe coming days will tell us how much of an impact Lam\u2019s actions will have on the future of the Hong Kong protests.\n\nSome argue that allowing the extradition law to be withdrawn will be taken as a sign of weakness \u2013 that Beijing is backing down. Others will disagree, arguing that Xi made his point of who is really in charge.\n\nThe reality is what the mixed messages suggest: that this clearly is not part of some well-thought-out plan.\n\nMeanwhile, on the trade front, Beijing continues to counter Trump\u2019s tariffs with an admixture of aggression and conciliation \u2013 and a recently announced new round of lawsuits filed against the U.S. at the World Trade Organization.\n\nXi looks like the passenger in an out-of-control elevator \u2013 smashing all the buttons in the hope one of them does something.\n\nIt is not at all clear that China has a concerted strategy for resolving the trade dispute with the U.S., nor does any path of obstruction seem likely to provide a promising outcome. The Xi regime may hope that Trump will just give up or back off \u2013 but what are the odds of that?\n\nChina\u2019s leaders could try to wait Trump out, hoping for a new occupant in the White House come 2021. But that means almost two more years of economic consternation and uncertainty for China. And for what? What if Trump is reelected? What if someone else is elected and is also tough on China?\n\nPerhaps China\u2019s leaders would be better off making a deal with the \u201cdevil\u201d they know now. They seemed on that path a few months and then backtracked.\n\nWhat\u2019s up?\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWhile Xi has a firm grip on power, there are hardliners who counsel against a trade deal with the U.S., as there are those who fret over the damage the trade war has done to the Chinese economy. Xi seems to be straddling somewhere in the middle.\n\nXi has never faced a confrontation like this before. There hasn\u2019t been a comparable trade dispute in modern times, not for China \u2013 or any other country.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. is pressing China on other fronts as well: strengthening defense cooperation with Taiwan; refusing to accede to Beijing\u2019s territorial claims in the South China Sea; considering deploying intermediate-range missiles in the region; lobbying against doing business with Chinese tech giant Huawei; building or strengthening partnerships in the Indo-Pacific; and questioning China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, which involves Chinese investments in infrastructure projects around the world.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd the world appears to be listening. Complaints about a heavy-handed China are much more common now than they were three years ago.\n\nThere is zero evidence that Xi was prepared for all of this. There is every indication that the regime is making up its response as it goes. No one knows how it will all turn out.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JAMES JAY CARAFANO", "description": "China's leader seems to be making up his response as he goes along to two crises -- protests in Hong Kong and the trade war with the U.S.", "authors": ["James Jay Carafano"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/AP19237452578498.jpg"}
