Tarbert.\n\n\u201cFraudulent schemes, like that alleged in this case, not only cheat innocent people out of their hard-earned money, but they threaten to undermine the responsible development of these new and innovative markets. America must be a leader in this space, and we will only succeed if these markets have integrity,\u201d Tarbert added.\n\nThe CFTC is looking to retrieve the funds paid into the scheme and hopes to return them to the victims, but this isn\u2019t guaranteed.", "description": "A man in the US has been charged for allegedly operating an $11 million Bitcoin Ponzi scheme.", "authors": ["Yessi Bello Perez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FUntitled-design-29.jpg&signature=9a50bc0650241e183f6945b373c95fec", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
