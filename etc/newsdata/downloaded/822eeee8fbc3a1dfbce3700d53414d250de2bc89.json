As well as the suspended jail term, he was ordered to carry out a drugs programme and commit to 35 days of rehabilitation activity. He was also ordered to pay \u00a3850 compensation to the two families affected by his rampage.\n\nHughes was also told to pay \u00a3850 in compensation to each of the two families involved and was made the subject of a five-year restraining order in relation to both.\n\nJPs heard Hughes, who has two teenage children and a 20-year cocaine addiction, was now engaging with drug and alcohol services.\n\nIn her witness statement, the mother said she found Hughes in her living room after hearing the window smash while her daughter watched TV.\n\nShe said: 'I immediately ran down concerned that my daughter may have hurt herself.\n\n'I could see a male climbing through my living room window which had been smashed. I let out a loud scream and was terrified.\n\n'My daughter was sat on the living room sofa screaming and crying and I was concerned for her safety.\n\n'The male was shouting repeatedly 'I've been shot!' I then heard my partner behind me yelling 'get the f*** out of my house.\n\n'The incident has left myself and my daughter terrified and extremely shaken.\n\n'We are both fearful that it might happen again and we've been left anxious by this occurrence.'\n\nRob Youds, prosecuting, told the court previously: 'He was described as having super strength and he didn't appear to feel pain.\n\n'He said he doesn't remember much. It's a blank.'\n\nSteve Coupe, defending, said his client was a 'mild-mannered and reasonable gentleman' and his behaviour that morning was out of character.\n\nHe said: 'He can't recall the vast majority of the incident.\n\n'He is remorseful and couldn't believe what he'd done when the facts were relayed to him.\n\n'He was acting in a manic way, with delusional thoughts and acting completely out of control.\n\n'He is mortified as to his actions, particularly in relation to how he must have scared the young child involved.\n\n'He is a parent and it has really brought matters to a head.'", "description": "Kelvin Hughes, 40, received a 16-week jail sentence which was suspended for a year after admitting two counts of criminal damage at Chester Magistrates' Court.", "authors": ["Darren Boyle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/14/19587608-0-image-a-9_1570799527828.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
