(That\u2019s right, this debate will be three hours long.)\n\nWhere: Texas Southern University, a historically black university, in Houston\n\nWhy is there only one night this time? Because the Democratic National Committee doubled the polling and donor requirements to make this stage, and so only 10 candidates qualified (compared with the 20 who qualified for the first two debates). Some presidential candidates, such as Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), dropped out after not making this debate.\n\nThe field could be split up again into two nights at the next debate in October. The qualifications will remain the same, and an 11th candidate, billionaire Tom Steyer, said he\u2019s qualified for that debate, which would split the debate stage in two.\n\nWho\u2019s in the debate? The highest-polling candidates will stand in the middle of the stage.\n\nKlobuchar Booker Buttigieg Sanders Biden Warren Harris Yang O\u2019Rourke Castro Klobuchar Booker Buttigieg Sanders Biden Castro Warren Harris Yang O\u2019Rourke Klobuchar Booker Buttigieg Sanders Biden Warren Harris Yang O\u2019Rourke Castro Klobuchar Booker Buttigieg Sanders Biden Warren Harris Yang O\u2019Rourke Castro\n\nWho are the moderators? ABC News chief anchor George Stephanopoulos, \u201cWorld News Tonight\u201d anchor David Muir, ABC News correspondent Linsey Davis and Univision anchor Jorge Ramos.\n\nWhat should I watch for? This will be the first time that two leaders in the polls, former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) will be on the same stage. If anyone has the ability to use debates to knock Biden off his stable position at the top of the polling, it could be her. Biden has given lackluster-to-mediocre debate performances; Warren has typically been strong in hers. Also, do Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who are splitting the liberal vote in the party, end their truce and attack each other?\n\nHow can I watch? Turn on ABC or stream on ABCNews.com. A Spanish translation will also air on Univision.\n\nHow did we end up with these 10 candidates?\n\nTo qualify for this debate, candidates had to register at least 2 percent in four of the 21 qualifying polls and earn donations from at least 130,000 individuals by Wednesday, Aug. 28.\n\nThe debate would have continued the next night only if more than 10 candidates qualified. Exactly 10 candidates made the cut.\n\nSecond debate Third debate Biden Biden Booker Booker Buttigieg Buttigieg Castro Castro Harris Harris Klobuchar Klobuchar O\u2019Rourke O\u2019Rourke Sanders Sanders Warren Warren Yang Yang Bennet Bennet de Blasio de Blasio Delaney Delaney Gabbard Gabbard Gillibrand Gillibrand Hickenlooper Hickenlooper Inslee Inslee Dropped out Ryan Ryan Williamson Williamson Swalwell Swalwell Bullock Bullock Messam Messam Moulton Moulton Sestak Sestak Steyer Steyer Requirements to qualify 1% in 3 polls 2% in 4 polls and or 65,000 donors 130,000 donors First debate Second debate Third debate Biden Biden Biden Booker Booker Booker Buttigieg Buttigieg Buttigieg Castro Castro Castro Harris Harris Harris Klobuchar Klobuchar Klobuchar O\u2019Rourke O\u2019Rourke O\u2019Rourke Sanders Sanders Sanders Warren Warren Warren Yang Yang Yang Bennet Bennet Bennet de Blasio de Blasio de Blasio Delaney Delaney Delaney Gabbard Gabbard Gabbard Gillibrand Gillibrand Gillibrand Hickenlooper Hickenlooper Hickenlooper Inslee Inslee Inslee Dropped out Ryan Ryan Ryan Williamson Williamson Williamson Swalwell Swalwell Swalwell Bullock Bullock Bullock Messam Messam Messam Moulton Moulton Moulton Sestak Sestak Sestak Steyer Steyer Requirements to qualify 1% in 3 polls 1% in 3 polls 2% in 4 polls and or or 65,000 donors 65,000 donors 130,000 donors First debate Second debate Third debate Biden Biden Biden Booker Booker Booker Buttigieg Buttigieg Buttigieg Castro Castro Castro Harris Harris Harris Klobuchar Klobuchar Klobuchar O\u2019Rourke O\u2019Rourke O\u2019Rourke Sanders Sanders Sanders Warren Warren Warren Yang Yang Yang Bennet Bennet Bennet de Blasio de Blasio de Blasio Delaney Delaney Delaney Gabbard Gabbard Gabbard Gillibrand Gillibrand Gillibrand Hickenlooper Hickenlooper Hickenlooper Inslee Inslee Inslee Ryan Ryan Ryan Dropped out Williamson Williamson Williamson Swalwell Swalwell Swalwell Bullock Bullock Bullock Messam Messam Messam Moulton Moulton Moulton Sestak Sestak Sestak Steyer Steyer Requirements to qualify 1% in 3 polls 1% in 3 polls 2% in 4 polls and or or 65,000 donors 65,000 donors 130,000 donors\n\nThe more stringent rules that the Democratic National Committee laid out for the third debate were an attempt to narrow the historically large field. Five candidates dropped out of the race in July and August: Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). But 20 remain in the race.\n\nCandidates on the bubble have missed their chance this round. In two final qualifying polls released Aug. 28, no candidate earned more than 2 percent who has not already qualified for the debate.\n\nThe fourth Democratic debate in October has the same polling and donor requirements. Tom Steyer collected another qualifying poll in September, so he\u2019ll have a spot on stage in October. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and Marianne Williamson have enough unique donors but each needs a few more qualifying polls to make the cut.\n\nThe seven remaining candidates have not hit 2 percent in any qualifying polls or reached the 130,000 unique donor threshold.\n\nReaching the donor threshold has been easier for most candidates than increasing their standing in polls. All of the 13 candidates who\u2019ve had at least one qualifying poll have already reached the donor threshold.\n\nSteyer reached the threshold after massively outspending all other candidates on Facebook and Google advertisements in the past month, prompting criticism from the field that he is trying to buy his way to the debate stage. He has spent more than $1.3 million on debate-related Facebook ads, according to Bully Pulpit Interactive.\n\nTom Steyer Kirsten Gillibrand Facebook ad Email to supporters Tulsi Gabbard Email to supporters Tom Steyer Kirsten Gillibrand Facebook ad Email to supporters Tulsi Gabbard Email to supporters Tom Steyer Tulsi Gabbard Kirsten Gillibrand Facebook ad Email to supporters Email to supporters\n\nBefore Gillibrand dropped out, she spent nearly $600,000 on Facebook ads specifically about debates \u2014 more than any other candidate besides Steyer. Gabbard asked supporters in an email to sign up for YouGov and answer calls from unknown numbers in an attempt to reach 2 percent in qualifying polls.\n\nA less publicized DNC rule required each of a candidates\u2019 four polls to come from different pollsters, or from different geographic areas. This caused a minor blowup in July, when entrepreneur Andrew Yang announced he had qualified for the debate, only to be told by the DNC that he could not count both of two national polls conducted (in part) by NBC. He later picked up his fourth poll in Iowa.\n\nPOLLED AT LEAST 2% National poll Polled less than 2% IA State poll Does not count Biden IA SC NH NH SC IA SC IA JUNE 28 AUG. 28 Buttigieg IA SC NH NH SC IA SC IA Harris IA SC NH NH SC SC IA IA Sanders IA SC NH NH SC IA SC IA Warren IA SC NH NH SC IA SC IA Booker IA SC NH SC IA SC O\u2019Rourke NH NH Klobuchar IA IA IA Yang IA Castro IA Steyer SC IA IA Not included in polls Gabbard NH Williamson POLLED AT LEAST 2% National poll Polled less than 2% State poll IA Does not count Biden IA SC NH NH SC IA SC IA JUNE 28 AUG. 28 Buttigieg IA SC NH NH SC IA SC IA Harris IA SC NH NH SC SC IA IA Sanders IA SC NH NH SC IA SC IA Warren IA SC NH NH SC IA SC IA Booker IA SC NH SC IA SC O\u2019Rourke NH NH Klobuchar IA IA IA Yang IA Castro IA Steyer SC IA IA Not included in polls Gabbard NH Williamson POLLED AT LEAST 2% National poll Polled less than 2% State poll IA Does not count JUNE 28 AUG. 28 Biden IA SC NH NH SC IA SC IA Buttigieg IA SC NH NH SC IA SC IA These candidates have polled at 2% or higher in every poll since June 28 Harris IA SC NH NH SC SC IA IA Sanders IA SC NH NH SC IA SC IA Warren IA SC NH NH SC IA SC IA Booker and O\u2019Rourke\u2019s polling averages are between 2 and 3% Booker IA SC NH SC IA SC O\u2019Rourke NH NH Klobuchar IA IA IA Klobuchar, Yang and Castro have been more successful in national polls than state polls Yang IA Castro IA Steyer SC IA IA Not included in polls Steyer, Gabbard and Williamson have reached the donor threshold but not the polling threshold Gabbard NH Williamson POLLED AT LEAST 2% National poll Polled less than 2% State poll IA Does not count JUNE 28 AUG. 28 Biden IA SC NH NH SC IA SC IA Buttigieg IA SC NH NH SC IA SC IA These candidates have polled at 2% or higher in every poll since June 28 Harris IA SC NH NH SC SC IA IA Sanders IA SC NH NH SC IA SC IA Warren IA SC NH NH SC IA SC IA Booker IA SC NH SC IA SC Booker and O\u2019Rourke\u2019s polling averages are between 2 and 3% O\u2019Rourke NH NH Klobuchar IA IA IA Klobuchar, Yang and Castro have been more successful in national polls than state polls Yang IA Castro IA Steyer SC IA IA Not included in polls Steyer, Gabbard and Williamson have reached the donor threshold but not the polling threshold Gabbard NH Williamson POLLED AT LEAST 2% National poll Polled less than 2% IA State poll Does not count JUNE 28 AUG. 28 Biden IA SC NH NH SC IA SC IA IA NH NH SC SC SC IA IA Buttigieg These candidates have polled at 2% or higher in every poll since June 28 Harris IA SC NH SC SC NH IA IA Sanders IA SC NH NH SC IA SC IA Warren IA SC NH NH SC IA SC IA Booker IA SC NH SC IA SC Booker and O\u2019Rourke\u2019s polling averages are between 2 and 3% O\u2019Rourke NH NH Klobuchar IA IA IA Klobuchar, Yang and Castro have been more successful in national polls than state polls Yang IA Castro IA Steyer SC IA IA Not included in polls Steyer, Gabbard and Williamson have reached the donor threshold but not the polling threshold Gabbard NH Williamson\n\nShelly Tan contributed to this report.\n\nAbout this report\n\nThis analysis is based on rules set by the DNC.
