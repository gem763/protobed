That's A Lot.", "language": "en", "text": "Jose Luis Magana/Associated Press President Donald Trump has gotten an incredible number of federal judges confirmed, thanks in large part to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) playing hardball with Senate rules.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 President Donald Trump has been bragging about all the lifetime federal judges he\u2019s gotten confirmed so far. He should! It\u2019s a lot.\n\nThe @nytimes. \u201cThis week, the Senate passed a milestone in confirming the 150th Federal Judge of Mr. Trump\u2019s Administration to a lifetime appointment, far outstripping Barack Obama\u2019s pace and fulfilling pledges by Mr. Trump and Mr. O\u2019Connell to remake the Federal Judiciary.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2019\n\n.....\u2019These Conservative Judicial appointments will impact our nation for years to come,\u2019 said Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who leads the Judiciary Committee and who has been speeding through Trump nominees.\u201d The entire Court System is changing at a record pace! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2019\n\nLook at where Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush were at this point in their terms. Obama hadn\u2019t confirmed nearly as many appeals court or district court judges. Bush had confirmed more district court judges by now, but Trump is way ahead of everyone on appeals court judges \u2015 the people who have the final say in nearly all federal cases around the country. Appeals courts resolve about 50,000 cases per year; the Supreme Court resolves about 100.\n\nGraphic: Jennifer Bendery/HuffPost. Source: Public records. Confirmations of federal judges during President Donald Trump's term compared with Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush at the same point in their presidencies.\n\nTrump\u2019s White House and Senate Republicans made a big push right out of the gate to confirm as many appeals court judges as possible precisely because of the concentrated power that rests with their courts. As a result, nearly 1 in every 4 seats on U.S. appeals courts is now filled by a judge appointed by Trump.\n\nThe quantity of Trump\u2019s judges is almost as dramatic as the quality. Republicans have been confirming piles of unqualified and ideologically extreme people to lifetime court seats, many of whom have records of being anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ rights and anti-voting rights. In the meantime, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) keeps stripping away the few tools typically afforded to the minority, essentially shutting Democrats out of the process.\n\nSince Trump took office, McConnell has blown up the Senate rules so Republicans could easily confirm the president\u2019s Supreme Court picks. He forced another change in the rules to drastically reduce the amount of debate time for Trump\u2019s district court picks. He\u2019s routinely broken from Senate tradition by advancing judicial nominees over the objections of that nominee\u2019s home-state senators.\n\nAnd under his leadership, the GOP-led Judiciary Committee has stopped honoring \u201cblue slips,\u201d which means senators can no longer single-handedly block judicial nominees from their home states \u2015 something Republicans did all the time when Obama was president.\n\nSo where does this leave Democrats? Surely there\u2019s something these United States senators can do to prevent the president from putting problematic, out-of-the-mainstream people all over the nation\u2019s courts.\n\nOr ... not.\n\n\u201cWe welcome any additional ideas,\u201d said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.). \u201cBut we have to win. We have to win the Senate. This just highlights the loss in costs of not having the votes here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can,\u201d said Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.). \u201cIf you care about the courts in our country and due process and justice, I\u2019m hopeful we\u2019ll have a different majority in January of 2021.\u201d\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) offered his party a glimmer of hope. He boasted that he and fellow Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley (D) successfully tanked appeals court nominee Ryan Bounds last year. Bounds hadn\u2019t disclosed some of his previous racist writings to a bipartisan state judicial commission, and Wyden and Merkley highlighted this to GOP colleagues weighing his confirmation. At the last minute, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) helped bring down Bounds.\n\n\u201cSen. Merkley and I have laid out for the Senate a pretty good example of how you stop extreme nominees,\u201d Wyden said. \u201cDo your homework. Get the facts out. And make sure your colleagues get to see it in time.\u201d", "description": "Democrats say they really only have one option for stopping more unqualified nominees: winning back the Senate in 2020.", "authors": ["Senior Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d813a20240000d3267d4474.jpeg?cache=f7jtbzs8xz&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
