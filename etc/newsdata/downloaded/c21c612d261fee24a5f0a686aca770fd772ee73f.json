Photo-Illustration: by Preeti Kinha; Photos: Getty\n\nVery early on Saturday morning, a full moon in tender, dreamy Pisces will suffuse the sky with emotion. Under this moon, think about the feelings that\u2019ve been quietly simmering for so long, the intuition that has been getting louder and louder in the back of your head, the wisdom you keep quietly accumulating. Now that you have it, what will you do with all this knowledge? How will you let all this feeling change you?\n\nAries Weekly Horoscope\n\nThis is a week to be clear-headed and intentional; you really don\u2019t have to care about the things you don\u2019t care about. It seems intuitive, but you\u2019d be surprised how easy it is to find yourself drawn into the fights you have no stake in, or to spend hours trying to answer questions you don\u2019t care about at all. You don\u2019t have to rush in, sparking with hot energy, to confront every fleeting frustration. This week, remind yourself that you get to choose where you\u2019re willing to direct your wild power and heat.\n\nTaurus Weekly Horoscope\n\nThis is a week to stop blaming yourself for being tired, to stop thinking that you should, somehow, be able to effortlessly bear the whole world\u2019s weight. There\u2019s no way not to be drained by everything being asked of you right now, and no way to make it through these days without rest, without help, so don\u2019t feel so ashamed for needing it. You\u2019re doing the work you need to do, and sometimes that work leads to exhaustion, and sometimes it leads to need. If you treat yourself gently, like a human, that need can lead to connection and joy.\n\nGemini Weekly Horoscope\n\nEven you can\u2019t remain endlessly hopeful, endlessly charming, endlessly bright in the face of all the world\u2019s sorrow \u2014 though it can feel, sometimes, as though this is exactly what the people in your life expect from you. And it\u2019s hard to feel like you aren\u2019t giving them the fun or the light that they need. This week, though, you might be surprised by what happens when you tell the truth. You won\u2019t drive love away by saying how you really feel. You can show up for your friends and they\u2019ll show up for you too.\n\nCancer Weekly Horoscope\n\nThis is not exactly a week for chaos, but it is a good time to disobey some of the world\u2019s rules. You don\u2019t have to value what the world tells you to value, and you don\u2019t have to work how the world tells you to work, and you don\u2019t have to act according to anyone else\u2019s vision of how things should be. Instead of all that, try to obey the rules you\u2019ve created for yourself, the ones you\u2019ve agreed, privately, to abide by. Try to honor your commitment to yourself and your life, your bone-deep desire to do right.\n\nLeo Weekly Horoscope\n\nThis is a week to think about growing up. Not generally speaking, but on a personal level. What does it feel like and what does it mean for you, personally, to get older? What kind of adult are you, and what kind do you want to be? Other people sometimes talk as though growing up means losing your sparkle, losing your edge, losing everything that ever made you feel alive. It isn\u2019t true, of course. The world still has bright surprises waiting for you. You aren\u2019t in charge of everything, but you can decide, at least, what your own life is going to mean.\n\nVirgo Weekly Horoscope\n\nThis week, remember that it\u2019s possible to lean into silliness and joy, and that it\u2019s possible to embrace love and enchantment without betraying your commitments or compromising your seriousness. Other people misunderstand this about you so often, thinking your seriousness is the same thing as a grim and unsmiling solemnity. You know better; your seriousness isn\u2019t about temperament or style. It\u2019s deeper than that. It\u2019s a way of loving the world, of practicing of accountability, of respecting the high stakes of living. And there\u2019s room for fun here, there\u2019s room for joy, there\u2019s room for everything you need.\n\nLibra Weekly Horoscope\n\nThere are things in the world and in your life that simply are not fair right now. Everywhere you look, you can see kindness and beauty and safety distributed unequally, nonsensically, and you can\u2019t seem to change things, no matter how charming or persuasive you are. Your task, this week, is to resist despair. You can work to connect and work together with other people. You can accept that some things take a long time. You can live each moment with courage and care, feeling the scale shift and balance, just a little bit, each time you move.\n\nScorpio Weekly Horoscope\n\nNo matter how much control you hold over your life, no matter how carefully you observe the world or how closely you regulate your actions, your feelings will occasionally exceed the bounds of the area you try to confine them to. This isn\u2019t a warning and it isn\u2019t a curse, just the natural truth of the world. Vulnerability isn\u2019t avoidable, no matter how hard you try. It doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re weak, just that you\u2019re still alive. Emotions won\u2019t destroy you, not even your most unruly ones.\n\nSagittarius Weekly Horoscope\n\nWhen you move in so many directions at once\u2014when you keep opening new doors and nurturing new possibilities into being\u2014it can be hard to see the places where you stand in your own way. It can be easy to fall so in love with motion itself that you stop paying attention to the direction you\u2019re going. This week, try to hold still for long enough to really notice where you are and where you\u2019re headed. You don\u2019t need everything, every future, every life. Keep moving, just try to choose the movement that matters to you.\n\nCapricorn Weekly Horoscope\n\nIt\u2019s so difficult, sometimes, to relate in a healthy way to work\u2014not to make a whole religion of it. This week, think about what it would mean to live not according to your goals, but your values: not in service of future success, but of the world around you. Maybe nothing would be different at all, but maybe something would shift inside you. Maybe something would soften, maybe something would snap into place. How would you choose to live if there was no such thing as success, only the complicated joy of the world that exists right now?\n\nAquarius Weekly Horoscope\n\nEven without the recognition you need, even without the support you deserve, you know the value of your mind, of your labor, of all the shimmering ideas you put out into the world. When the people around you don\u2019t see all that, you\u2019re not one to waste your time trying to convince them. Normally this is a good strategy \u2014 it saves you needless effort and protects you from getting your heart broken too hard. This week though, it\u2019s not the worst thing in the world to keep trying to show the world what it missed. To invite the world, again, to see you truly.\n\nPisces Weekly Horoscope\n\nYou can\u2019t ever be totally certain that you\u2019re doing the right thing, which is one of the most grindingly unfair things about everyday life. It\u2019s so easy to see all the possibilities branching out from where you are, and so easy to see the darkened places where the things you don\u2019t yet know wait for you. Don\u2019t hold yourself responsible for all that you can\u2019t know. All you can do is make a choice and see what happens, and then make another one.\n\nGet Madame Clairevoyant every week.
