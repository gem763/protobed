Scientists have attempted to estimate the number of people at risk, but according to a new study, all those numbers have been far too low.\n\nThe research, published in the journal Nature Communications today, indicates that three times more coastal residents worldwide are vulnerable to sea-level rise and flooding than previous estimates suggested.\n\nThe two climate scientists behind the new study, Scott Kulp and Benjamin Strauss, work at the organization Climate Central. They concluded that 110 million people worldwide already live on land that's below the current high-tide line. About 250 million, meanwhile, occupy land below current annual flood levels.\n\nWhat's more, their model shows that a significant number of people live just above today's high-tide line.\n\n\"There is a really huge concentration of population density in the very lowest strips of land, in the lowest places along the coast globally,\" Strauss told Business Insider. \"It turns out within those first couple of meters [above sea-level], there are more than 3 million people per vertical inch.\"\n\nA quarter of a billion people worldwide live just above the high-tide line\n\nCitizens in Miami, Florida contend with high-tide flooding. Kevin Loria/Business Insider\n\nIn the 20th century, the average global sea level has already risen 6 inches due to warming waters and melting ice sheets. This has already led to more high-tide flooding (often called king tides or sunny-day floods). This kind of flooding \u2014 unlike that from storm surges during extreme weather events like hurricanes \u2014 can happen any time ocean water surges to higher levels than coastal infrastructure was designed to accommodate.\n\nFor the new study, the researchers looked at data from 135 countries across multiple emissions scenarios and timelines. Typically, international flood-risk assessments use data from NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), which mapped the elevation of countries around the world from space.\n\nBut, according to Strauss, that data uses the tops of buildings as proxies for elevation, not the actual height of the ground those buildings sit on. So Strauss and Kulp used a new model designed to correct that discrepancy.\n\nThey found that, even under a highly optimistic scenario in which greenhouse-gas emissions peak next year then decrease, 190 million people would occupy land below sea-level by the end of the century. If emissions continue to rise through 2100, that number could reach 630 million people globally. That's nearly double the current US population.\n\nThese numbers are triple the totals scientists would glean by using just the NASA data.\n\n\"We've elucidated that you can't measure flood risk by analyzing the elevation of rooftops \u2014 you have to know the height of the ground beneath your feet,\" Strauss said.\n\nEven more concerning, he added, is the number of people who currently live less than 32 feet (10 meters) above today's high-tide levels: 1 billion. Nearly a quarter of those 1 billion people live less than 3 feet (1 meter) above that line.\n\n\"The magnitude of the numbers speaks for itself,\" Strauss said.\n\nA man rides his bicycle on a flooded street in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, July 23, 2015. Reuters/CDIC\n\nThe study results suggest that people in Asia \u2014 Indonesia in particular \u2014 are \"disproportionately threatened by this issue.\"\n\nTheir model found that by 2050, 237 million people in China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand could face annual coastal flooding threats. By 2100, if emissions continue unchecked, that number could reach 250 million.\n\nSea levels could rise 3 feet by 2100\n\nA recent report from United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also suggested that our current estimates of future sea-level rise may be too low.\n\nIf Earth's temperature increases by more than 3 degrees Celsius, the authors found, water levels would be an average of 3 feet higher by the year 2100. The planet's average temperature has already gone up by 1 degree Celsius, and sea levels have risen globally by about 6 inches (15 centimeters). But the rise is accelerating, the report found.\n\nA man walks through water covering State Street in Boston at high tide during a nor'easter storm on March 2, 2018.

Strauss said his new study builds off these results.\n\nThe primary cause of sea-level rise, according to the IPCC, is the melting of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, which are melting six times faster then they did four decades ago.\n\nRoughly 1.7 million square kilometers (656,000 square miles) in size, the Greenland ice sheet covers an area almost three times that of Texas. Together with Antarctica's ice sheet, it contains more than 99% of the world's fresh water, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center.\n\nA melting iceberg floats near a cemetery in Kulusuk, Greenland, August 15, 2019. Felipe Dana / AP\n\nIf the entire Greenland ice sheet were to melt \u2014 granted, this would take place over centuries \u2014 that would cause a 23-foot rise in sea level, on average. That's enough to submerge the southern tip of Florida. If both Antarctica and Greenland's ice sheets were to melt, sea levels would rise more than 200 feet. Florida would disappear.\n\nRising ocean temperatures (the seas absorb 93% of the extra heat trapped on Earth by greenhouse gases) also cause sea levels to rise regardless of ice melt, since water expands when heated.\n\n\"The biggest take-home message is: The number of people who will be threatened by sea-level rise this century is extraordinary,\" Margaret Williams, managing director of the World Wildlife Fund Arctic Program, previously told Business Insider.\n\nAccording to Strauss, these new estimates should serve as motivation to address that threat now.\n\n\"Even as we show there's a far greater threat from sea level rise, we now know that there are far greater benefits to cutting emissions,\" he said. \"This new data can be a useful tool for cities and countries to plan better for the future their coastal populations are facing.\"", "description": "A new study suggests that far more people could experience the consequences of coastal flooding than earlier estimates suggested.", "authors": ["Aylin Woodward"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db74512dee019393f42c929?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
