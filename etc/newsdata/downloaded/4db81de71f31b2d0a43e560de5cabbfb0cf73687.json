Far from terrestrial plants and light-filled shallows, the open ocean makes no accommodation for human comfort or survival.\n\nIslands are the exception. These widely scattered landing places offer respite in the form of fresh water, abundant food and the occasional fruity cocktail.\n\nMaybe that's the travel secret behind the evocative power of beautiful islands. Like the rainforest-cloaked island of Kaua'i , some are the summits of drowned volcanoes, smoking and burning above the waterline. Others, such as the Seychelles , are the scattered shards of continents, while atolls are coral crusted over a sinking landmass.\n\nEvery single one invites travelers to leave familiar shores behind.\n\nFrom Norway's Arctic reaches to the sunny reefs of Palawan , these beautiful islands span latitudes, climates and cultures.\n\nWhether you're dreaming of a beachy escape or plotting a course for the edges of the Earth, these are the world's 10 most beautiful islands:\n\nMilos (Greece)\n\nThis is where the famous Venus de Milo statue was discovered in 1820.
