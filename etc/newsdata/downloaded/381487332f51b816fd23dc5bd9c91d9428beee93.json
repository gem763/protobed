At least post-Watergate there remained plenty of conservative Southern Democrats, and the Democratic Party nationally was moving back somewhat to the center after being shocked into reality by the 49-state loss by leftist George McGovern. Today, on the other hand, the Democratic presidential field is a battle between far Left, farther Left, and crazy Left. And there is no longer a tradition of cross-partisan comity on Capitol Hill or even of semi-shared values to moderate legislative action or executive fiat.", "description": "", "authors": ["Quin Hillyer", "Washingtonexaminer.Com Opinion Political-Survival-Instinct-Alone-Should-Make-Gop-Want-A-Challenger-To-Trump"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
