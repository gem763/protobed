More than 5,000 of these heavy supersonic fighters were built, and hundreds continue to serve and even see combat in several air forces today.\n\nBut the Phantom\u2019s record in air-to-air combat over Vietnam \u2014 especially when compared to its successor, the F-15 Eagle, which has never been shot down in air-to-air combat \u2014 has left it with a reputation of being a clumsy bruiser reliant on brute engine power and obsolete weapons technology.\n\nThis is unfair.\n\nThe Phantom\u2019s fundamental flaws were corrected by 1970 \u2014 while more recently, Phantoms have had their avionics and ordnance upgraded to modern standards. These modernized Phantoms flown by the Turkish and Greek air forces can do pretty much what an F-15 can do \u2026 at a much lower price.\n\nBaptism of Fire:\n\nWhen the F-4 came out it in 1958 it was a revolutionary design \u2014 one that went on to set several aviation records.\n\nWeighing in at 30,000 pounds unloaded, its enormous J79 twin engines gave (and still gives) the aircraft excellent thrust, propelling the heavy airframe over twice the speed of sound at a maximum speed of 1,473 miles per hour.\n\nThe early Phantoms could carry 18,000 pounds of munitions \u2014 three times what the huge B-17 bombers of World War II typically carried. The weapons officer in the rear-seat could operate the plane\u2019s advanced radar, communication and weapons systems while the pilot focused on flying.\n\nFurthermore, the F-4 came in both ground- and carrier-based models and served in the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marines. The only other frontline fighter to serve in all three services before or since is the F-35.\n\n(Recommended: How to Replace the F-35)\n\nBut when the F-4 confronted the lighter-weight MiG-17 and MiG-21 fighters of the North Vietnamese air force in 1965, the Phantom suffered.\n\nIn the Korean War, the U.S. Air Force had shot down between six and 10 enemy fighters for every one of its aircraft lost in air-to-air combat. In Vietnam, the ratio was closer to two to one (including other aircraft types besides the Phantom).\n\nThe F-4\u2019s primary problem was that it had no built-in cannon. Instead, it relied entirely on newly-introduced air-to-air missiles \u2014 the radar-guided AIM-7 Sparrow, the heat-seeking AIM-9 Sidewinder and the older AIM-4 Falcon.\n\nThe Air Force didn\u2019t realize those early missiles were terrible.\n\nStudies showed that 45 percent of Vietnam-era AIM-7s and 37 percent of AIM-9s failed to either launch or lock on, and after evasive maneuvers, the probability of achieving a kill fell to eight percent and 15 percent for the two types, respectively. The Falcon missiles were even worse, and the Pentagon later withdrew them from service.\n\nAlso From TNI: Donald Trump: The Worst President Ever?\n\nAlso From TNI: Donald Trump: Best President Ever?\n\nAlso From TNI: Why Japan Really Lost Pearl Harbor\n\nThe North Vietnamese MiGs, equipped with both cannons and missiles (on the MiG-21), would outmaneuver the heavier F-4, which for all its speed, was not especially agile. Worse, American pilots weren\u2019t trained for close range dogfights, as the Air Force assumed air-to-air engagements would occur at long range with missiles.\n\nFurthermore, the Phantom\u2019s J79 engines produced thick black smoke, which combined with the aircraft\u2019s larger size, made it easier to spot and target from a distance. On the other hand, the rules-of-engagement over Vietnam prohibited U.S. pilots from shooting at unidentified targets beyond visual range, further crippling the advantages of the missiles.\n\nImprovements:\n\nHowever, the F-4\u2019s problems began to recede. Air-to-air missile technology dramatically improved with later versions of the Sparrow and Sidewinder. The F-4E model finally came with an internal M161 Vulcan cannon.\n\nBefore, some Phantom units made do with external gun pods that vibrated excessively.\n\nIn 1972, an F-4 piloted by Maj. Phil Handley shot down a MiG-19 with his plane\u2019s gun \u2014 the only recorded aerial gun kill performed at supersonic speed.", "description": "The story of the legendary\u00a0F-4 Phantom II.", "authors": ["Sebastien Roblin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/etTJ9YWKocjYDzymegW7Gg--~B/aD05NzA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/b0367a626ca3a0cf4e8cf0a0333b8660", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
