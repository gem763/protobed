Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nThe U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia, one year after Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s death\n\nOn Oct. 2, 2018, Jamal Khashoggi walked into the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul and did not walk out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEventually, we came to learn that he was dismembered by a group of Saudi agents and his body was removed,\u201d says national security reporter John Hudson . \u201cTo this day, we do not know where that body is.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post contributing columnist had been a critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his regional agenda, attempts to suppress democracy and free expression, and exclusion of Islamist parties from politics.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CIA, U.S. allies and a U.N. investigator say Mohammed is culpable in the savage killing of Khashoggi. But one year out, world leaders have welcomed the crown prince back into the community of nations with major economic agreements and contracts.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018His potential future looks more and more shaky\u2019\n\nNearly six months after taking over as acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Kevin McAleenan feels he has lost some of the authority he was promised when he took the job, even as he has guided the United States out of a crisis at the southern border.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcAleenan spoke candidly with immigration enforcement reporter Nick Miroff about his slipping grasp on the department and its messaging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe has delivered on the one thing that mattered most to the president, which was to drive the border numbers down, even though he doesn\u2019t talk about immigration or message on immigration the way that other officials in the Trump administration do,\u201d Miroff says.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nNewly discovered audio from the D-Day invasion\n\nThe sound from the scratchy audiotape is chilling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou hear people yelling, and you hear these planes going over this incredible din of antiaircraft fire,\u201d says history writer Mike Ruane . \u201cThe correspondent\u2019s trying to narrate what\u2019s going on, and his voice is drowned out in different parts by the racket of gunfire.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the tape \u2014 sourced to D-Day, 1944 \u2014 radio correspondent George Hicks captures the raw sound of battle off the coast of Normandy. Among the best pieces of audio to come out of World War II, the tape has lived in a researcher\u2019s basement for many years. Now, it\u2019s coming to the National D-Day Memorial in Bedford, Va.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWho knows how important this could be in the end,\u201d Ruane says.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "John Hudson examines the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia, one year after Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s murder.
