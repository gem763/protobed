Their new album, Hey, I\u2019m Just Like You, is a compilation of their teenage demos \u2014 things they wrote when they were still growing up in Calgary in the \u201990s. The songs have been reimagined, aligned with their current musical tastes, and polished by an all-female team. The 12-track record comes out around the same time as their memoir, High School, a look back at their coming-of-age years. \u201cLast year while writing our new memoir, we came across two cassette tapes with dozens of songs we wrote in high school,\u201d Tegan explained on an Instagram post announcing the album. \u201cDefiant and melodramatic, the songs captured the exultation and grief of first loves, first losses, ecstatic kiss-offs, and psychedelic tributes to the friendships we had as teenagers. It had been over twenty years since we had heard the songs and quite honestly, we both expected to listen once, cringe, and bury them for another couple decades. But they were good.\u201d They only added four sections of new lyrics throughout the whole album, so often Tegan sings Sara\u2019s words and vice versa. For many of the tracks, they both sing, \u201cmaking them the first truly \u2018Tegan AND Sara\u2019 songs.\u201d", "description": "Tegan and Sara reimagine their teenage music demos and turn them into an album over 20 years later.
