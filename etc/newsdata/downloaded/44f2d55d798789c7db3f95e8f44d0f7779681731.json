The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\nNews that Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has formally withdrawn the extradition legislation that sparked mass protests in the territory must be viewed with caution. The aims of the 13-week long protest movement in the territory have broadened beyond opposition to the extradition bill to include a push for democratic reform and investigations into police brutality.\n\nWhile Lam's concession removed the original cause of the protests, the turmoil has already inflicted serious damage to Hong Kong's economy. Hong Kong's Census and Statistics Department reported that GDP contracted 0.4% in the second quarter. If the societal upheaval continues, economic slowdown in the territory will likely weigh on the broader Asian economy, with wider fallout for Asia's trading partners worldwide.\n\nWhile dwarfed by the economic output of the United States and China, Hong Kong is a critical hub for global trade and finance. It was the world's seventh-largest exporter of merchandise in 2017, according to the World Trade Organization. It is also the third leading global financial center, after New York and London, according to the Global Financial Centre Index. According to a triennial survey conducted by the Bank for International Settlements, Hong Kong with $437 billion in FX transactions in 2016 was the second-largest foreign exchange market in Asia and the fourth largest in the world that year.\n\nCivil unrest, if it persists, will represent a systemic stress point for global commerce, which has already been weakened by the US-China trade dispute. Ongoing economic disruption in the territory would not be confined to China and other parts of Asia but would also extend to the rest of the world, including Germany and the United States.\n\nIn a rare display of bipartisan consensus, Republican and Democratic leaders in the United States have taken notice. In August, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, publicly threatened to have the Senate reconsider the 1992 Hong Kong Policy Act. This law gives Hong Kong preferential treatment in matters of trade and economics compared with mainland China by treating Hong Kong as a separate jurisdiction. In June, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, issued a statement calling for a review of U.S.-Hong Kong trade ties over the extradition bill.\n\nRead More", "description": "News that Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has formally withdrawn the extradition legislation that sparked mass protests in the territory must be viewed with caution.", "authors": ["Bill Campbell For Cnn Business Perspectives", "Bill Campbell For"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190902035911-08-hong-kong-protest-0902-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
