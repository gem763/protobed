'This acquisition will allow us to expand the scope of our ADAM Research Project and accelerate R&D that could lead to numerous aerospace and engineering breakthroughs.'\n\nAt least some of the material obtained by To The Stars, 'shows distortion and damage that appears to be caused by exposure to very high temperatures, but did not burn,' according to Justice.\n\n'We have some very strategic plans to help turn the science of these pieces into advanced capabilities,' the researcher was quoted saying in another of DeLong'es recent IG posts.\n\n'Wave Guides, mass reduction, all new meta-materials, and many more potentials are within view of new studies, some of which are already happening, and more studies we are planning.'\n\nThe Navy says spectacular footage released in 2017 that shows 'unexplained aerial phenomena' is authentic. This footage was captured by Navy Pilots off the coast of Florida in 2015\n\n'The Navy considers the phenomena contained/depicted in those three videos as unidentified,' Navy spokesman Joseph Gradisher told The Black Vault\n\nDeLonge says he has been fascinated by the prospects of alien life since he was in junior high school.\n\n'I started becoming very fascinated in the idea of what else is there besides working a 9-to-5 job and coming from a broken family,' the singer told the New York Times.\n\n'For some reason I just thought science fiction was just fascinating. My brother and I were so into the whole 'Star Wars' thing, obviously, in the early '80s. It just kind of led to me thinking a little bit broader.'\n\nHe said alien hunters like himself have been waiting for the U.S. government to confirm the existence of extra terrestrials, regarding the military's recent transparency on its pilots' UFO footage as a step in the right direction.\n\n'This whole thing could be answered by the government,' DeLonge added.\n\n'We're just waiting for them to come and help us with some of this research.\n\n'This situation that just happened is literally something I and many other people have been waiting for for not years, but decades.\n\n'This is what we've been hoping it would do so it can really just ignite more smart people and intellectuals to get into this race and help us figure out more about it.'\n\nSo far neither the U.S. military has commented on To The Stars' latest findings.\n\nNASA did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com's request for comment Monday night.\n\nLast month, the United States Navy confirmed that spectacular footage released in 2017 that appears to show 'unexplained aerial phenomena' is authentic, but that the footage was never meant to be made public.\n\nThe clips were first published by The New York Times in December of that year and were recorded by Department of Defense officials on two separate occasions.\n\nOne clip was recorded near San Diego, California back in 2004, while a second video was captured off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida in 2015.\n\nSeveral months after those videos were published, To The Stars Academy released an additional video from the 2015 incident, which features a navy pilot remarking: 'What the f**k is that thing?'\n\nThe Navy last month confirmed the authenticity of the videos for the first time.\n\nFootage captured by William Guy last week shows strange lights above the horizon on the waters off North Carolina's Outer Banks\n\n'The Navy considers the phenomena contained/depicted in those three videos as unidentified,' Navy spokesman Joseph Gradisher told The Black Vault.\n\nIn recent weeks, strange sightings have once again ignited the debate of whether humans are alone in the universe.\n\nA man on a ferry just off North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks posted a video to YouTube last week showing about a dozen glowing flashes of light over the horizon.\n\n\u2018Anybody tell me what that is?\u2019 William Guy of Indiana says in the video.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re in the middle of the ocean, on a ferry, nothing around. Look. Nothing around. No land, no nothing.\u2019\n\nGuy traveled to the waters off North Carolina to assist in repairing the damage caused by flooding during Hurricane Dorian, according to the Charlotte Observer.\n\nDespite the excitement that these may be a UFO, commenters on YouTube noted that the lights are most likely flares used by the military during drill exercises.\n\nThe Outer Banks are close to a number of military bases, including Camp Lejeune and Fort Bragg.\n\nGuy, however, isn\u2019t convinced.\n\n\u2018A lot of people I have talked to here on the island said it was flares, but they also said they have never seen anything like what I captured,\u2019 he wrote on YouTube.", "description": "Luis Elizondo of To The Stars Academy of Arts and Science spoke just a week after it was learned that his organization, co-founded by Blink-182's Tom DeLonge (right), revealed discovery of new material.", "authors": ["Chauncey Alcorn", "Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/19/19339218-0-image-a-2_1570298919331.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
