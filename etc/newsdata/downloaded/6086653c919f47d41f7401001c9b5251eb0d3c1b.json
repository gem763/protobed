After adjusting for stock-based compensation, $6.5 million in restructuring costs and other effects, FireEye reported earnings of 2 cents a share, down from 6 cents a share a year ago. The company also said it had billings \u2014 which reflect future business under contract that is not yet on the balance sheet \u2014 of $248.6 million, up from $219.3 million a year ago.\n\nAnalysts on average expected FireEye to report adjusted earnings of a penny a share on revenue of $219.9 million, with billings of $247.3 million, according to FactSet. Those estimates increased slightly after FireEye told analysts at an event Oct. 8 that revenue was expected to come in at the high end or above its previously stated range of $217 million to $221 million, and billings would be within the stated range of $245 million to $255 million.\n\nFireEye FEYE, -4.68% shares gained 5% the day after announcing those preliminary third-quarter results, but fell 4.7% to $15.48 on Tuesday ahead of the results, for a market capitalization of $3.3 billion. In immediate after-hours trading following their release, the stock fell to less than $15. Overall, shares have declined 5.7% in the past year, as the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.08% has increased 15.1%.\n\nFireEye continues to morph its business from one focused on selling security products to one that collects recurring revenue for its software and services. Revenue for the quarter was 52.2% from product and related sales, but Chief Executive Kevin Mandia wants that to fall to less than 30% in the long term, according to his presentation to analysts earlier this month.\n\n\u201cWe continued to execute on our long-term plan to transform FireEye from our origins as a network-security product vendor to comprehensive security-platform company,\u201d Mandia said in prepared remarks Tuesday. \u201cRecord third-quarter billings for our platform, cloud subscription and managed services as well as professional services categories demonstrate our progress.\u201d\n\nFireEye will host a conference call with executives at 2 p.m. Pacific time.", "description": "FireEye Inc. reported increased quarterly sales and billings Tuesday afternoon, but profit slipped and shares fell more than 3% in late trading.", "authors": ["Jeremy C.
