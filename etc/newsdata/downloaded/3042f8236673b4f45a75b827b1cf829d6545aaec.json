Neither house of Congress has arrested anyone since 1935, but it was not uncommon before that point (and was blessed by the Supreme Court in 1927). Indeed, on at least two occasions, the second in 1916, a house of Congress had its sergeant arrest an executive branch official. (In that case, the Supreme Court eventually ruled against the House, not because it did not have the power to arrest for contempt, but rather because the offense \u2014 writing a nasty public letter to a House subcommittee \u2014 could not properly be understood as contempt of Congress.) Facilities in the Capitol or one of the House office buildings can be made into a makeshift holding cell if necessary. Of course, arrestees will ask the courts to set them free, but the case should be relatively open-and-shut against them: They will have committed a contempt in refusing to turn over subpoenaed materials, and the House has the power to hold contemnors. Moreover, time would work in the House\u2019s favor here: The unpleasantness of being in custody while the issue was being litigated might make some contemnors decide to cooperate.\n\nChafetz\u2019s op-ed comes after far-left \u201cSquad\u201d member Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) claimed House Democrat colleagues are exploring ways to arrest White House officials who refuse to comply with subpoenas as part of their inquiry probe.\n\nAddressing constituents at a town hall in her hometown of Detriot, Tlaib said Democrats are mulling over how to arrest Cabinet secretaries and other Trump administration officials.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve ever had a situation like this,\u201d Tlaib said. \u201cSo they\u2019re trying to figure out, no joke, is it the D.C. police that goes and gets them? We don\u2019t know. Where do we hold them?\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats are in \u201cuncharted territory\u201d and \u201ctrying to tread carefully,\u201d the freshman congresswoman added.\n\n\u201cI will tell them they can hold all those people right here in Detroit,\u201d she quipped. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of them and make sure they show up to the committee hearings.\u201d", "description": "A Cornell Law School professor\u00a0wrote that Democrats should consider arresting Trump officials refusing to cooperate with impeachment.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/08/wi/ap/20/6d0dfd_giuliani-truth-00224-rudy-giuliani-in-wednesday-aug-2018-file-photo-rudy-e1570728112481-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
