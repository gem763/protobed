Economists had been expecting economic activity to have recovered a little from July, when it fell to its lowest level in more than a decade.\n\nValue-added industrial output in China rose 4.4% in August from a year earlier, far below economists\u2019 expectations of 5.2% growth and slower than the 4.8% increase in July, the National Bureau of Statistics said Monday.\n\nFixed-asset investment outside Chinese rural households climbed 5.5% in the January-August period from a year earlier, slightly below expectations. Retail sales in China rose 7.5% in August from a year earlier, a tick down from the 7.6% gain in July and below expectations for a 7.9% rise.\n\nWith the latest economic numbers, Beijing is now at risk of a vicious cycle, said Li Wei, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank, who warned of deflationary pressure on companies as soft demand squeezes profits, leading to destocking and reduced investment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now all about the government\u2019s tolerance for slower growth and what kind of policy tools they want to use to stimulate growth,\u201d Mr. Li said.\n\nFor now, China\u2019s leaders have adopted a measured tone. Premier Li Keqiang said China\u2019s economic performance in the first eight months of 2019 was steady overall, with some signs of progress, according to a statement posted on the government\u2019s main website Monday.\n\n\u201cAgainst the backdrop of a complicated international situation and given the higher base of comparison, it is not very easy for China to still sustain a medium-to-high growth speed of above 6%,\u201d the premier was quoted as saying ahead of a visit to Russia. \u201cSuch a speed still ranks high among the world\u2019s major economies.\u201d\n\nFu Linghui, a statistics bureau spokesman, also partly attributed disruptions to business operations on powerful storms and other temporary factors.\n\nMr. Fu said the government remains confident that it can meet its goal of keeping growth within a range between 6% and 6.5% this year. China\u2019s economy expanded 6.3% in the first half of the year.\n\nMany economists have said they expect growth to slow further from the second quarter\u2019s 6.2%, with some forecasting third-quarter growth below the lower bound of Beijing\u2019s target range.\n\n\u201cGiven the much weaker economic data in August, it\u2019s quite difficult for the Chinese economy to maintain growth of more than 6% in the third quarter,\u201d said Zhaopeng Xing, an economist with ANZ.\n\nChina in recent weeks has stepped up efforts to halt an economic slowdown, providing extra support for local-government bond issuance and releasing more funds for banks to lend to businesses.\n\nMany economists, including those at Standard Chartered and ANZ, expect the central bank to lower key market rates this month, not only to bring down borrowing costs but also to send a strong message that Beijing is willing to support its economy.\n\nRising expectations for lower interest rates boosted Chinese bond prices, which move conversely with yields.\n\nThe property market was one of the few bright spots in August. Home-sales growth in China was resilient in August, accelerating even as Beijing continued to tightly control property purchases.\n\nHome sales by value for the January-August period rose 9.9% from a year earlier, higher than the 9.2% gain for the first seven months of the year.\n\nDevelopers\u2019 aggressive promotion campaigns and home-buyers\u2019 fears of further tightening measures led to the increase in real-estate transactions, said Yan Yuejin, an analyst at property services firm E-House China R&D Institute.\n\nReal-estate investment, however, will probably slow in the coming months as pessimism about the property market\u2019s outlook and a cooling economy sets in among developers, Mr. Yan said.\n\nAnother silver lining was the unemployment rate, which is based on an official survey in China\u2019s large cities. edged down to 5.2% from July\u2019s 5.3%\u2014a reading that was tied for the highest level since the government began publishing the data last year.\n\nThe general economic picture could also improve if trade tensions between China and the U.S. continue to ease. Both Washington and Beijing have recently made some goodwill gestures to ease bilateral trade tensions.\n\nChina said Friday that it would exempt purchases of U.S. soybeans, pork and other agricultural products from punitive tariffs, a move that appears aimed at addressing one of President Trump \u2019s most pressing demands during the protracted trade war.\n\n\u2014Liyan Qi, Grace Zhu, Lin Zhu", "description": "Economic activity in China cooled further in August, testing Beijing\u2019s tolerance for slower growth as it seeks to ease trade tensions with the U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107338/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
