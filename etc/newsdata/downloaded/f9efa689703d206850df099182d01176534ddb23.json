Yet it remains to be seen how much Morey\u2019s apology will mollify the various entities in China that expressed such loud dismay about Morey\u2019s original Twitter post, in which he shared an image that read, \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong\u201d \u2014 referencing to the protests that have raged for months.\n\nIn addition to Chinese sponsors such as the shoe company Li Ning and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Card Center, which both announced that they were pausing their partnerships with the Rockets, team officials faced an immediate backlash from the Chinese Basketball Association and the Chinese consulate in Houston. The basketball association announcement Sunday that it was suspending cooperation with the Rockets was particularly jarring, since the federation president is the Hall of Fame center Yao Ming, who starred from the Rockets from 2002 to 2011.", "description": "Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, posted a tweet supporting protesters in Hong Kong, upsetting the Chinese Basketball Association led by the Hall of Famer Yao Ming.", "authors": ["Sopan Deb", "Marc Stein"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/06/sports/06nba-rocketschina-lede/merlin_138360510_faf7c46f-6307-4520-a2e0-a67dfa71eb32-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
