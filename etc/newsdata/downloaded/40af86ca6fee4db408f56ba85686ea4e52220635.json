According to a secret memo I've been slipped, tests carried out last year found 'obsolete' fire safety systems risked burning down the 'rest of the Palace'.\n\nWhoever wins the Speakership early next month has been warned they will not get into the apartment until September 2020 at the earliest. Last night, critics of the Speaker said his ever-changing departure date had exacerbated the problem and Bercow had 'dragged his feet' over the repairs.\n\nWould-be Tory MP Fay Jones at the Tory Party Conference in Blackpool in 2005\n\nWould-be Tory MP Fay Jones had a guilty secret to confess at her successful selection meeting in Brecon and Radnorshire last week.\n\nShe was indeed one of the amply chested women wearing an 'It's DD For Me' T-shirt supporting David Davis's 2005 leadership bid \u2013 a stunt that led to charges of sexism.\n\nFay, right in that T-shirt during the campaign, told the party faithful she had learnt 'I don't look good in pink T-shirts'.\n\nBut I prefer her original defence: 'If blokes are going to look at your boobs, they might as well learn something in the process.'\n\nHe was dubbed 'the most unreasonable Frenchman in France' for his handling of the Brexit talks, but those hoping we have seen the last of EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier should not pop the champagne corks just yet.\n\nAfter the delayed exit process dashed the silky Eurocrat's dreams of heading the EU Commission, I hear he has vowed to stay on to hammer out the UK's trade deal with the bloc. With only 14 months to sort it out, expect to hear Barnier's favourite catchphrase \u2013 'I only hear the clock ticking' \u2013 yet again.\n\nPM turns Francois into 'angry tomato'\n\nBrexit hardliner Mark Francois pompously declared: 'I can't keep the PM waiting' in a bid to avoid reporters' questions on his way to No 10 on Friday.\n\nBut I hear it was Boris who kept the pint-sized MP waiting for half an hour, to his obvious fury. 'He was marching around like a loaded spring, huffing and puffing,' said a source, while another compared the spluttering 'Spartan' to an 'angry tomato'.\n\nWhen he was finally summoned, my spies say he carried on earwigging aides all the way up the stairs. His diary was obviously far busier than Boris's.\n\nBrandon Lewis is getting into his stride as the ministerial boss of Britain's security services. The ex-Tory Party chairman is enjoying his upgraded parliamentary office, especially since a window is directly above an alcove favoured by loquacious MPs for secretly briefing hacks.\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab last week banned selling arms to Turkey after the attack on Kurds in Syria. I wonder if he got an earful from his regular barber \u2013a Kurdish refugee.\n\nDesperate staffers were left without running water at Conservative HQ all week. I hear furious bosses have launched a leak inquiry.", "description": "Speaker John Bercow has enjoyed a splendid grace-and-favour apartment in the Palace of Westminster during his long reign - but unfortunately his successor won't revel in the same luxury.", "authors": ["Harry Cole For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/22/19938656-0-image-a-53_1571522210314.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
