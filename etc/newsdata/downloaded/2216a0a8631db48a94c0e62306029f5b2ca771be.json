President\u2019s party pulls election disappearing act", "language": "en", "text": "MOSCOW \u2014 Voters in Moscow go to the polls in a local election on Sunday, but when they examine their ballot papers, they won\u2019t find a single candidate running on the ticket of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s United Russia party.\n\nInstead, more observant voters will discover United Russia members posing as \u201cindependent candidates\u201d in an apparent bid to distance themselves from Putin\u2019s increasingly unpopular party.\n\nThis is the first time since it was formed in 2001 that United Russia has failed to nominate \u2014 officially \u2014 candidates for the City Duma polls. Its logo, a bear, once ubiquitous in the run-up to elections, is conspicuously absent from campaign billboards. Opposition activists have defaced election posters for \u201cindependent\u201d candidates affiliated to Putin\u2019s party with stickers reading: \u201cCaution! United Russia candidate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a black mark against a candidate if they publicly acknowledge that they are a United Russia party member,\u201d said Konstantin Gaaze, a political analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center think tank. \u201cThis party is pretty dead.\u201d\n\nUnited Russia\u2019s plummeting ratings mean that Putin could be forced into a rethink of the party\u2019s role as he attempts to engineer a way to stay in power.\n\nSupport for United Russia has plummeted over a controversial five-year increase in the retirement age and a series of corruption allegations, putting at risk the party\u2019s domination of Russia\u2019s parliament and complicating Putin\u2019s efforts to extend his rule beyond 2024, when his presidential term (technically his last) expires.\n\nA poll published in April by Vtsiom, the state pollster, indicated that only 22 percent of voters in Moscow would back a United Russia candidate in the City Duma election, while 37 percent said they would choose an independent. Another poll, published in July by the St. Petersburg Politics Foundation, an independent think tank, found that just 11 percent of Muscovites now support United Russia. Gaaze estimated that backing for United Russia in central Moscow districts near the Kremlin, widely considered to be liberal strongholds, could be in the single figures.\n\nPutin also pulled the \u201cindependent\u201d trick last year, winning reelection after dumping United Russia during his presidential election campaign. However, his own ratings have slumped to near-record lows this year amid growing poverty.\n\nUnited Russia is providing its undercover candidates for the City Duma with massive financial backing. Moscow Election Commission records indicate that over 30 candidates with established ties to Putin\u2019s party have received around 800 million roubles (\u20ac10.9 million) from organizations connected to United Russia and the All-Russia Popular Front, another Kremlin-backed organization.\n\nAndrei Metelsky, the leader of Putin\u2019s party in Moscow, denied that the decision to run as independents is an attempt by United Russia-linked candidates to mislead voters. Instead, he insisted it is a demonstration of political courage. \u201cWe are not hiding beneath the party banner,\u201d he wrote in a Facebook post in May. \u201cWe are not afraid of personal responsibility and we are ready to answer to our electorate.\u201d\n\nVedomosti, a Russian business newspaper, reported Thursday that the Kremlin is considering pulling Metelsky from the election over alleged corruption involving property in the Austrian alps worth some \u20ac78 million. The allegation, which Metelsky denies, was first made in July by Alexei Navalny, the prominent Kremlin critic.\n\nIt\u2019s not only in Moscow that United Russia is experiencing problems. Nationwide, the ruling party has the support of around 32 percent of voters, according to Vtsiom. Last year, United Russia candidates lost four local governor elections to rivals from the Communist Party and the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. While both the Communists and the LDPR are ostensibly in opposition to United Russia, they are widely believed to be controlled to varying degrees by the Kremlin.\n\nBesides the high-profile City Duma poll in Moscow, votes are also taking place on Sunday to elect the heads of 16 of Russia\u2019s regions, as well as lawmakers to 13 regional parliaments. In an unprecedented move, six of the United Russia governors running for reelection are standing as independents. In St. Petersburg, acting governor Alexander Beglov, the former head of United Russia\u2019s branch in the city, is the only candidate without official party backing. His biography was wiped from United Russia\u2019s website ahead of the vote. Beglov insists that his party is \u201cthe people.\u201d\n\nHow to stay in power\n\nUnited Russia\u2019s plummeting ratings mean that Putin could be forced into a rethink of the party\u2019s role as he attempts to engineer a way to stay in power after his current term of office comes to an end. Under Russia\u2019s constitution, presidents are barred from serving more than two consecutive terms. The constitution can only be rewritten if the ruling party has a two-thirds majority in parliament and although United Russia currently enjoys such a majority, its fading fortunes mean changes to Putin\u2019s carefully constructed political system could be imminent.\n\nBloomberg News reported in July that the Kremlin was considering cutting the share of seats elected from party lists in parliament from 50 percent to 25 percent. The rest of the seats would be contested in local districts, allowing United Russia members to run as nominal independents. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to sacrifice the party and proceed with so-called independent candidates,\u201d said Gaaze, the analyst.\n\nWhile no opposition candidates have been allowed to stand in the City Duma race, that doesn\u2019t mean Navalny and his supporters intend to watch passively from the sidelines.\n\nDespite United Russia\u2019s unpopularity, meaningful reforms to shake up the party are unlikely in the near future, said Tatiana Stanovaya, head of the political analysis firm R.Politik. That\u2019s because, she said, Putin\u2019s advisers are feeding him inaccurate information, telling him that United Russia\u2019s ratings are declining solely because of pension reforms and that the situation is \u201cmanageable and stable.\u201d\n\nThe City Duma vote comes after government-loyal election officials barred Kremlin critics from the ballot, sparking the largest opposition protests since 2012. Over 2,500 people were arrested as protesters faced off against police in central Moscow for five straight weekends this summer. Although most of those detained were quickly released, five people have so far been handed prison sentences. Among them was Kirill Zhukov, who was imprisoned for three-and-a-half years for lifting a police officer\u2019s visor. Five other suspects are still awaiting trial. Critics say the charges were trumped up to dissuade Russians from attending opposition rallies.\n\nOn Thursday, Konstantin Kotov, a 34-year-old opposition activist, was sentenced to four years in prison after being found guilty of attending multiple unsanctioned, yet peaceful protests. The sentence came shortly after Putin told an economic forum in Vladivostok that Russians have the right to protest.\n\n\u201cUnited Russia no longer represents the interests of the majority of people, and the Kremlin knows this very well,\u201d said Lyubov Sobol, a lawyer with Navalny\u2019s anti-corruption organization. Sobol undertook a 32-day hunger strike this summer in an ultimately unsuccessful bid to force her way onto the City Duma ballot. \u201cBut the authorities are trying to take the right to run in elections and the right to protest away from us.\u201d\n\n\u201cVote for the candidate most likely to weaken United Russia and its monopoly,\u201d said Alexei Navalny in an online video.\n\nProject, an investigative journalism website that often cites sources within the government and other power structures, reported this week that authorities took the decision to bar opposition candidates after internal polling revealed that Kremlin critics were poised to win at least nine seats in the City Duma.\n\nIlya Yashin, another aspiring opposition candidate, was 28 percentage points ahead of his nearest rival before he was removed from the race, according to an opinion poll published by the Levada Center, an independent think tank in Moscow.\n\nAlthough the 45-seat City Duma has few significant powers, Kremlin strategists are concerned that victory on Sunday would allow opposition candidates to gain a political platform ahead of parliamentary elections due in 2021, an official involved in the discussions told Project.\n\nWhile no opposition candidates have been allowed to stand in the City Duma race, that doesn\u2019t mean Navalny and his supporters intend to watch passively from the sidelines. Navalny is pushing a strategic voting plan aimed at depriving United Russia of its majority. \u201cVote for the candidate most likely to weaken United Russia and its monopoly,\u201d he explained in an online video.\n\nIn many cases, however, Navalny\u2019s plans would involve voting for Communist Party or nationalist candidates, something that many Russian liberals would likely balk at. The strategy was defended by Oleg Stepanov, who heads operations at Navalny\u2019s headquarters in Moscow. \u201cWe want to see different forces in parliament, to make it into a platform for discussion,\u201d he said.\n\nThe \u201cSmart Voting\u201d plan, as Navalny has dubbed it, also has the potential to force United Russia into the kind of blatant election fraud that sparked massive protests after the 2011 parliamentary elections.\n\n\u201cUnited Russia is a liability for its candidates,\u201d said Stepanov, who is overseeing the training of election monitors for Sunday\u2019s polls. \u201cAnd so the authorities have only one way to save themselves \u2014 by rigging these elections.\u201d\n\nLate Thursday, masked police officers raided Navalny's anti-corruption offices, his headquarters, and the studio where he records videos for his popular YouTube channel. \"Smart Voting has clearly got the authorities spooked,\" he said in a social media post.", "description": "United Russia party candidates are standing as \u2018independents\u2019 in Moscow ballot.", "authors": ["Marc Bennetts", "Rym Momtaz"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1069807288-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
