After that, we started seeing each other almost every day - he'd come to my apartment being heading home from the office and we'd have the best sex of my life,' she said.\n\nAddicted to the chemistry and danger, she started lying to her friends and family to hide the affair and before long fell deeply in love with him.\n\nTheir long running affair was characterised by secret lunch dates, sneaky lies and sex in cars (stock image)\n\n'One day I told him I loved him, and he said it back. After we said I love you, the sex got even better,' she admitted, acknowledging that in hindsight, she was simply a young girl infatuated with someone who filled an insecurity she had about men.\n\nBut weeks later, he told her he regretted saying 'I love you', an admission which proved to be a much-needed wake up call.\n\nShe consciously fought the infatuation by becoming less available and secretly dating other people, realising that ultimately, he would continue with his family life and leave her alone.\n\nThey stopped meeting for lunch dates and confined their relationship to the bedroom, but she admitted she felt bitterness and hate towards him even during sex.\n\n'I'd constantly throw his marriage in his face. I'd make comments about how good men don't lie to the mother of their children. Good men don't cheat on their wives,' she said.\n\nWhat causes relationships to fail? A relationship can have many downfalls but 'marriages often die more by ice than by fire' says relationship expert Dr Michael McNulty. Couples drift apart and this often leads to break-ups. The first steps that lead to couples drifting apart in a break-up can be broken down as follows: Stage one: More negativity than positivity seeps into the relationship. Stage two: The four horsemen of the apocalypse - Contempt, criticism, defensiveness and stonewalling all contribute to a poisonous relationship. Stage three: Flooding - The stage where anger starts coming out in the relationship and the partners become highly emotional. Stage four: Emotional disengagement - After the vast amount of emotional unrest before this is where the relationships becomes stale, with both parties checking out already.\n\nThe relationship stalled when both parties began sleeping with other people, and the woman finally grew tired of the cheating husband and his lies.\n\n'Admittedly, it took more than one attempt to walk away from this unhealthy relationship,' she said.\n\n'Anyone who has been in a toxic relationship knows how hard it is to leave. But after several tries, with pain and tears, I finally blocked his number and never spoke to him again.'\n\nYears later, the woman admitted she still remembers the experience with sadness and embarrassment.\n\nShe cautioned others about the dangers of mistaking lust for love, saying simply: 'It's not worth it.'", "description": "An anonymous Australian woman has shared her story of being the 'other woman', revealing why she embarked on an affair with a married man and why she continued to sleep with him for more than a year.", "authors": ["Alice Murphy For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/01/19671670-0-image-a-3_1571011822985.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
