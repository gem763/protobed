[...] If I had been on the Fed, I would like to have seen encouragement for the development of cryptocurrencies like Frax. It can be a check and balance against runaway currencies.\u201d\n\nThis summer, Moore joined a new crypto project dubbed \u201cDecentral,\u201d which counts Kazemian as CEO and Mike Novogratz \u2014 the founder of crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital \u2014 as a purported investor. At the time, Decentral was also planning to issue a fiat/asset-pegged or algorithmically stabilized stablecoin.\n\nDecentral pitched itself as a platform that will assume responsibilities similar to the U.S. Federal Reserve within the cryptocurrency space, such as regulating monetary supply and exchanging its own token for other cryptocurrencies.\n\nPreviously, Moore commented on Facebook\u2019s not-yet-released Libra stablecoin, stating that \u201cit\u2019s interesting, because this [Libra] represents a new challenge for central bankers that they now have competition from private currencies.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, G20 finance leaders agreed that global acceptance of stablecoins will give rise to a set of serious public policy and regulatory risks.", "description": "Heritage Foundation economist Stephen Moore is planning to release a stablecoin that relies on a fractional reserve", "authors": ["Ana Alexandre"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNDkwM2ViODY5OGFlNzVkYjJlNmU3OGI0OWY2OGVhNmUuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
