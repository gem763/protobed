College football\u2019s hottest ticket carries startling price", "language": "en", "text": "No. 7 Notre Dame\u2019s game at No. 3 Georgia on Saturday offers the week\u2019s most compelling matchup, as two storied programs will duel at one of the sport\u2019s iconic sites.\n\nAnd while it has been billed as the week\u2019s top game, it also figures to double as the most sought-after ticket for a college football game this season.\n\nThe combination of Notre Dame\u2019s national draw, Georgia\u2019s rabid fan base and the rarity of the matchup \u2013 the schools have only played each other three times \u2013 the ticket market has responded accordingly. This summer, according to TicketCity, the starting price to get in Notre Dame-UGA was $674. That was nearly double the amount of the next highest \u2013 Texas and LSU at $386.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThat get-in price has gone down a bit this week, as the summer prices were geared more toward fans planning trips ahead of time. The lowest get-in price from TicketCity on Tuesday afternoon was $382 for the worst seats, and the general feel is that the cost will rise as there\u2019s a relative lack of inventory on the market.\n\nOverall, the Notre Dame-Georgia game has been considered the most difficult to obtain this year in the ticket market, with Texas-LSU and Texas-Oklahoma trailing. According to Jack Slingland, the vice president of operations for TickPick, the game has the highest average purchase price of any game sold on the ticket site this year. The $502 average price is ahead of both Texas-LSU ($475) and OU-Texas ($435). \u201cWhen they first announced this matchup, we knew it was going to be a hot ticket,\u201d Slingland said.\n\nThe Georgia Bulldogs and Notre Dame Fighting Irish met in 2017 in a narrow 20-19 win for the Bulldogs. (Getty)\n\nStory continues\n\nTwo years ago, Georgia fans raided Notre Dame Stadium and colored it red for the Bulldogs\u2019 20-19 victory. Georgia hadn\u2019t played a regular season game north of the Mason-Dixon line in nearly a half century, and Bulldogs fans took advantage of the once-in-a-lifetime pilgrimage to South Bend.\n\nAccording to data from SeatGeek provided by Notre Dame, a visit from the Fighting Irish results in a 96 percent ticket bump on tickets in the secondary market. That\u2019s the highest in all of college football, with Michigan (68 percent) and Penn State (67 percent) the next highest.\n\nThat explains why Notre Dame is routinely involved in the year\u2019s most expensive tickets.\n\n\u201cIt has been a number of years now where we\u2019ve had that distinction,\u201d Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick said by phone this week. \u201cThe Georgia game here, the Michigan game. The home-and-home with Texas had it. It\u2019s a cool dynamic.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t expect Irish fans to pull a stadium takeover on Saturday. They have been allotted 8,000 tickets, and Swarbrick said the amount of destination games that they play each season makes it less likely that Irish fans would attempt a reciprocal stadium takeover. According to TickPick, 13 percent of their orders have come from Illinois and Indiana. While Notre Dame has alumni and fans everywhere, that number doesn\u2019t indicate a larger-than-normal opposing fan contingent.\n\nGeorgia athletic director Greg McGarity didn\u2019t get any sense of that happening. He said the most unique aspect of Saturday from the Georgia perspective is that there could be an additional 90,000 people outside the gates of Sanford Stadium, which seats nearly 93,000.\n\nThe presence of ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d combined with the historic nature of the matchup has created a buzz that\u2019s expected to overflow Athens with people.\n\n\u201cThrough the 2020s and 2030s there\u2019s not another series scheduled with Notre Dame,\u201d McGarity said in a phone interview Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes this unique. It\u2019s the only time the Fighting Irish will be between the hedges.\u201d\n\nJust how many Notre Dame fans will be able to buy their way into this game? McGarity said it will be easy to tell, as Notre Dame\u2019s 8,000 tickets come in two finite blocks located on the 600-level from end zone to end zone and in the northwest corner of the stadium. The amount of gold sprinkled in areas other than those will indicate how many Notre Dame fans braved the secondary market for the game.\n\nMcGarity did say that Georgia\u2019s takeover of Notre Dame stadium came with a large dollop of Midwestern hospitality that they\u2019re planning to return.\n\n\u201cOur fans had an awakening traveling to Notre Dame they\u2019d never experienced as a visiting team,\u201d McGarity said of the courteous treatment. \u201cThere\u2019s a groundswell of Georgia fans wanting to reciprocate the support the Notre Dame fans and staff showed for us. We don\u2019t see that everywhere we go.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "With Notre Dame's national audience and Georgia's rabid fanbase, Saturday's clash of contenders isn't going to be a cheap ticket for those who want to see it in person.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nRkuQQQSVkcEbNv_Qf4Hrg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/P15K1Y9q4cLLaZdGGvqElA--~B/aD0yODkxO3c9NDMzNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/6a947b50-d98e-11e9-af71-256bbf9082c5", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
