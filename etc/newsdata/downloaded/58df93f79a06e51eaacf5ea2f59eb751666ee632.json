The main match at risk would seem to be England v France in Yokohama at 5:15 p.m. on Saturday.\n\nJapan are due to play Scotland also in Yokohama at 7:45 p.m. on Sunday. The storm is forecast to have swirled into the sea by then but the aftermath could still produce bad weather and possible travel chaos.\n\nWhat plans do organizers have?\n\nOrganizers have frequently trumpeted what they call a \"robust\" contingency plan, with options including postponing a match, moving venues or cancelling it.\n\nIn a recent interview with AFP, tournament organizer Alan Gilpin explained the timescale of when they would take a decision on whether to move a match or change the timing of a game.\n\n\"From a match perspective, 72 hours out, we want to know really if there are going to be any potential adverse impacts. So that's the kind of early warning. If it looks like there will be, from that point, we are getting updated information every three hours,\" explained Gilpin.\n\n\"And then 24 hours out really, we need to know, from a fairly realistic perspective, what is the impact of that tropical storm, typhoon.\"\n\n\"Where's that going to strike, what's the wind speed and what's the potential impact of that. So we'll pre-make decisions 24 hours out,\" he added.\n\nA decision on cancelling a match would be confirmed \"six to eight hours out,\" the organizer added.\n\nWhat happens if match cancelled?\n\nDuring the pool stages, where the games come thick and fast, there is no possibility of rescheduling a match.\n\nIf a game has to be cancelled due to adverse weather, it counts as a 0-0 draw, with both teams getting two points each.\n\nFrom the knock-out stages, there are reserve days if a match cannot be played.\n\nWho could benefit?\n\nThe two matches most at risk are England v France in Pool C and Japan v Scotland in the tightly contested Pool A.\n\nEngland and France are playing to see who tops the pool. In the case of an abandoned match, this honor would go to England, who currently have 15 points compared to France's 13.\n\nIn Pool A, an abandoned match would be a disaster for Scotland, as it would mean they are unable to qualify. Japan, in contrast, would top the group, setting up a fixture against South Africa in the quarterfinals.\n\nWill it affect the Formula One?\n\nRace organizers are likely to act cautiously after tragedy struck the Japanese Grand Prix of 2014, when Marussia driver Jules Bianchi lost control in heavy rain on the fringes of a typhoon, and remained in a coma until his death the following July.\n\nAt its current speed and trajectory, Hagibis is likely to bring its worst weather to the Suzuka track, west of Tokyo, on Saturday.\n\nOrganizers may choose to postpone Saturday's qualifying session until Sunday, the same day as the race, as happened in both 2004 and 2010 as typhoons threatened.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "A powerful typhoon is bearing down on Japan and could severely disrupt the last round of pool games at the Rugby World Cup this weekend -- not to mention Formula One's Japanese Grand Prix.
