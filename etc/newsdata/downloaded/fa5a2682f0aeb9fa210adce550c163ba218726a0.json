The work stoppage also hurt the economy in key auto manufacturing centers in Michigan and throughout the Midwest due to tens of millions of dollars of lost wages.\n\nThe vote clears the way for workers to return to 31 factories around the country, a process that is expected to begin immediately.\n\nAuto supply company Lear, which makes seats and electronic components for GM cars, projected it would take about one week to fully ramp up its work for GM after the strike.\n\n\u201cThe weekly impact of the strike has kind of grown as the strike has continued as there are more facilities that eventually became impacted,\u201d Lear Chief Executive Raymond Scott said Friday during an earnings conference call.\n\nScott said the strike had dented Lear\u2019s revenues by about $70 to $75 million per week.\n\n\u2013 Ohio plant to shut \u2013\n\nSenator Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, praised the agreement.\n\n\u201cI am grateful that both parties have come to an agreement that prioritizes job security, fair pay and strong benefits,\u201d Stabenow said. \u201cThis is good news for our workers, Michigan\u2019s families and our economy.\u201d\n\nOhio Senator Sherrod Brown, also a Democrat, praised the UAW, but slammed GM for going ahead with a plan to shut a plant in Lordstown, Ohio.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s ratification is a testament to the value of the labor movement,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWithout the UAW, GM could have increased workers\u2019 health care costs, kept their wages flat and continued to use temporary workers indefinitely.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, this is another in a long line of sad days for the people in Lordstown,\u201d Brown added. \u201cGM\u2019s unilateral decision this year to close Lordstown and their continued refusal to bring a new product to the plant is betrayal of the Mahoning Valley.\u201d\n\nWith the GM contract now finalized, the UAW said it will next move into negotiations with Ford. That will be followed by talks with Fiat Chrysler.\n\nShares of GM rose 2.6 percent to $36.74 Friday in anticipation of the positive vote tally, which was released after the stock market closed.", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 General Motors hourly workers ratified a new contract with the auto giant on Friday, ending the longest automotive strike in the US", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/aa33d2_united-auto-workers-uaw-member-joe-ryan-2l-leads-prayer-recite-strike-closing-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
