The pupils, who wore maroon uniforms, filed to a camp where police assessed their condition and contacted family members.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNo responsible democratic government would tolerate the existence of the torture chambers and physical abuses of inmates in the name of rehabilitation of the victims,\u201d Buhari\u2019s spokesman Garba Shehu said in a Saturday statement.\n\nAD\n\nThough Buhari\u2019s office applauded Ni\u00adger\u00adian police for curbing the abuse, officials stopped short of announcing policy changes to confront the problem.\n\nAn estimated 10 million children attend Islamic schools in Nigeria, which for centuries were a path to becoming a religious scholar. Teachers are supposed to promote discipline, peace and humility, and part of the education can involve begging for money on the street.\n\nSome parents pay tuition for their children to memorize the Koran. Others hope religious leaders can help youths with drug addiction and mental illness in areas that lack formal health care.\n\nBut a dearth of watchdogs has led to exploitation in some programs.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe more people who rely on them, the more brutal they become,\u201d said Isa Sanusi, spokesman for Amnesty International in the Nigerian capital, Abuja.\n\nAD\n\nThree days before the Kaduna raid, authorities rescued 500 captives from an Islamic school in Katsina State, which billed itself as a rehabilitation program for young men and boys with behavioral issues.\n\nThe victims were chained to walls, struck with canes and often went hungry in packed rooms, officials said. Some reported enduring sexual abuse.\n\nThey had been \u201csubjected to all forms of dehumanization,\u201d police spokesman Sanusi Buba told Voice of America.\n\nOn Oct. 12, police freed 67 men and boys from a similar facility in the same northwestern state. Photos showed shirtless victims sitting on the ground \u2014 some with chains around their necks.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey were just beating, abusing and punishing us every day [in] the name of teaching us,\u201d Lawal Ahmad, 33, told Reuters at the time. \u201cThey are not teaching us for the sake of God.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnd on Sept. 27, authorities discovered 500 men and boys living in what Kaduna police chief Ali Janga described to the BBC as a \u201chouse of torture,\u201d triggering a wave of scrutiny of such institutions across the region.\n\nChildren as young as five were kept in chains. Police released a photo of a boy with scars down his back and arms.\n\nEnrollment in unregulated religious education has climbed as parents, who often cannot afford primary school fees, seek alternatives that look honorable on the surface, said Matthew Page, associate fellow at Chatham House\u2019s Africa Program in London.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know how widespread the problem is, he said, because data is scarce and oversight is flimsy.\n\n\u201cThere is this absence of the state,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen it comes to regulating entities like these schools effectively.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Authorities accuse loosely regulated Islamic schools of inhumane treatment of their students.", "authors": ["Danielle Paquette", "West Africa Bureau Chief"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HbQF-KnY8BWN-OiyrGRzKeLRN7c=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5ZBPTYHUAUI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
