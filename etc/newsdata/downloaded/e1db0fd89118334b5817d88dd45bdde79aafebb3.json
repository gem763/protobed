Amy Klobuchar (Minn) has criticized Juli\u00e1n Castro over the way in which he attacked Joe Biden during Thursday\u2019s debate, likening it to \u201csomething that Donald Trump might tweet out.\u201d\n\nFormer Housing Secretary Castro made a dig about former Vice President Biden\u2019s memory during a heated exchange on health care. \u201cAre you forgetting already what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro asked at one point.\n\nPolitifact has deemed the substance of Castro\u2019s attack as \u201cmostly false.\u201d\n\nAnd it was the style of the dig that irked Klobuchar.\n\nDuring CNN\u2019s post-debate analysis, Klobuchar was asked what went through her mind at the time. \u201cIt was pretty obvious what [Castro] was getting at,\u201d said the network\u2019s Dana Bash, alluding to it being a dig about Biden\u2019s age.\n\n\u201cUgh, I just thought, this is not cool,\u201d responded Klobuchar.\n\n\u201cI think you can have policy differences and I was one of the few ones up there that was willing to take on Bernie and some of these things even though we work together all the time, but I would never do it personally,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd I thought that was so personal and so unnecessary, when in fact we\u2019ve got to unite.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we done this in 2018, that\u2019s how we took back the House. We united behind candidates and we didn\u2019t treat each other like Donald Trump,\u201d Klobuchar continued. \u201cAnd one of the things that\u2019s bothered me is how he has coarsened the rhetoric and I believe we don\u2019t just have to change policies, we have to change the tone in the politics. And when a statement like that is made, it doesn\u2019t feel like that. It feels like something that Donald Trump might tweet out.\n\nCheck out the clip here:\n\nAmy Klobuchar on her reaction to Juli\u00e1n Castro's jab at Joe Biden's memory: \"I just thought this is not cool. ...

He doubled down in an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo, who said it \u201cseemed like a cheap shot.\u201d Check out the interview here:\n\n\u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d also chimed in with a tweet:\n\nThe crowd did not like Julian Castro playing the old man card against Joe Biden.
