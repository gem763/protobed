The Australian spun his Renault backwards into the barriers in the closing stages of the first 90-minute session and crawled back to the pits with a dislodged rear wing.\n\nSeveral drivers had minor off-track moments or spins, as they tested the limits of the circuit, with two brief virtual safety car periods during the day.", "description": "Max Verstappen knocked Ferrari rival Charles Leclerc off the top of the timesheets to go fastest on the opening day of practice for the Russian Formula One Grand Prix.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434576154&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q186", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
