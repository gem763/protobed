This ISA allows savers aged between 18 and 40 to set aside up to \u00a34,000 a year with a government bonus of 25 per cent a year up to a maximum of \u00a31,000.\n\nWhile the Help to Buy ISA only offers the top up to \u00a33,000, the Lifetime ISA maximum is offered every year until the age of 50. That could mean a maximum free top up of \u00a332,000 in total if you start one as soon as you turn 18.\n\nThe problem is that so far very few providers are offering the Lifetime ISA.\n\n\u201cThere are just three cash Lifetime ISA offerings for savers to choose from, compared to 27 Help to Buy ISA providers,\u201d says Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at investment platform AJ Bell.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more this lack of competition is hitting savers\u2019 pockets, as the top Help to Buy ISA interest rate is 3 per cent, compared with the top Lifetime ISA that pays 1.1 per cent.\n\n\u201cWith the Help to Buy ISA\u2019s days numbered we would hope that providers are working behind the scenes to launch a Lifetime ISA later this year, which in turn will boost take-up among first-time buyers and lead to a healthier market.\u201d\n\nIn the first year of its launch, 166,000 people opened a Lifetime ISA saving a total of \u00a3517m, but there\u2019s no doubt that more providers would build more awareness, and more people would know that they can use the ISA to get up to \u00a31,000 a year towards their first home.\n\n\u201cIf you already have a Help to Buy ISA you can keep paying into it for another decade, and you have until 1 December 2030 to claim your government bonus,\u201d Ms Suter adds.\n\n\u201cAlternatively you can transfer to a Lifetime ISA and benefit from a higher limit of \u00a3450,000 on the value of the property you can buy, a bigger potential government bonus each year and the ability to save lump sums rather than just monthly.\u201d", "description": "An in-depth study of the government\u2019s Help to Buy loan scheme shows the deal not only supported those who didn\u2019t need the money, but also helped inflate already high property prices.
