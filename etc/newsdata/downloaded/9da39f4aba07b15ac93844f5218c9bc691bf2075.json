U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude had\n\ngained 16 cents or 0.3% to $52.97 a barrel.\n\n\"Oil is starting to see some bullish positions added on the\n\neasing of two big tail risks for global demand, the U.S.-China\n\ntrade war and Brexit,\" said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst\n\nat OANDA in New York.\n\n\"While a broader trade deal seems unlikely in the immediate\n\nfuture, the risks for the U.S.-China trade war have been\n\nfading.\"\n\nLast-ditch talks between Britain and the European Union to\n\nget a Brexit deal ahead of a summit of the bloc's leaders this\n\nweek ran past midnight to Wednesday, but it was still unclear if\n\nBritain could avoid postponing its departure, due on Oct. 31.\n\nAnalysts have said any deal that avoids a \"hard\" or no-deal\n\nBrexit should boost economic growth and in turn oil growth and\n\nprices.\n\nProviding more support, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad\n\nBarkindo said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting\n\nCountries \"will do whatever (is) in its power\" along with its\n\nallied producers to sustain oil market stability beyond 2020.\n\nOPEC, Russia and other producers have cut oil output by 1.2\n\nmillion barrels per day to support the market.\n\nYet an expected rise in U.S. crude inventories this week\n\nkept prices under pressure. EIA/S\n\nU.S. crude stocks probably grew for the fifth straight week,\n\na preliminary Reuters poll showed.\n\nU.S. oil inventory reports are due out from industry group\n\nthe American Petroleum Institute on Wednesday and the U.S.\n\nEnergy Information Administration on Thursday. The reports have\n\nbeen delayed one day because of a U.S. government holiday.\n\n\"Should EIA inventories illustrate for a fifth consecutive\n\nweek build, we expect for strong selling pressure to afflict oil\n\nprices on an intraday basis,\" Benjamin Lu from Phillip Futures\n\nsaid in a note.\n\nConcerns of a global economic slowdown due to a lingering\n\ntrade war between the United States and China and swelling U.S.\n\ninventories also pressured prices.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade war will cut 2019 global growth to its\n\nslowest pace since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the\n\nInternational Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday.", "description": "UPDATE 1-Oil prices edge higher as OPEC hints at deeper output cuts", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC8S19N_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
