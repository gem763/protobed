Ed Markey. The 38-year-old Congressman made his plans official with an event in East Boston Saturday.\n\nHe began his announcement by talking about his family history and the American dream, then took to attacking President Trump.\n\n\u201cI know that through fate but often times through choices made by this country, by our government, that those barriers have been erected not taken down. Far too many dreams have been blocked or deferred rather than realized. And I know that for the first time in modern American history, we have a president that is actively trying to make that harder,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has forced a reckoning in our nation, without question. But to make this moment requires more than just defeating him, it requires taking on, clearly, a broken system, the calcified structure that allowed him to win in the first place.\u201d\n\nBig news: I'm running for US Senate. This isn't a time for waiting, for sitting on the sidelines, or for playing by rules that don't work anymore. This is the fight of our lives, the fight of my generation \u2014 and I'm all in. I hope you'll join me at https://t.co/7zwvI9aujq pic.twitter.com/WVkNLwCJbg \u2014 Joe Kennedy (@joekennedy) September 21, 2019\n\nTeamsters Local 25, the largest union in the state, also announced their endorsement of Kennedy Saturday.\n\n\u201cSince his election to Congress, Joe Kennedy has been a strong advocate for workers\u2019 rights and protections. Teamsters and all Massachusetts working men and women deserve and need a Senator who will put their interest first, protecting fair wages and benefits and provide emerging industries with a workforce for the future. Teamsters Local 25 strongly supports Joe Kennedy and is proud to endorse him for U.S. Senate,\u201d said Teamsters Local 25 President Sean M. O\u2019Brien in a statement.\n\nIBEW Local 103 also endorsed Kennedy. \u201cThis is about doing what\u2019s best for working people. Yes, that means being strategic about the long-term and putting leaders and advocates into the U.S. Senate like Joe Kennedy III who will be able to fight for workers\u2019 rights not just for the current generation, but also for the next,\u201d said IBEW Local 103 Business Manager/Financial Secretary Lou Antonellis in a statement.", "description": "Joe Kennedy announced Saturday he will officially run for U.S. Senate against Sen.
