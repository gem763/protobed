They are getting training they all wanted \u2014 in how to save someone who has overdosed on opioids.\n\nThe group of four is learning how to administer a dose of naloxone, a medication used to block or reverse the effects of the highly addictive painkillers.\n\nA mannequin is placed on a table in the middle of the workshop where trainer Elvis Rosado, an ex-drug user who works for the local association Prevention Point, is showing them the ropes.\n\nThe widespread use of fentanyl \u2014 a synthetic opioid that is 50 times stronger than heroin \u2014 is ravaging America, and Philadelphia is in the crosshairs of the epidemic.\n\nJust a few milligrams can be lethal.\n\n\u201cIf people have to do this training everywhere, it shows there is an obvious need and an obvious problem in this country,\u201d Rosado says.\n\n\u2013 Price of an overdose? Two bucks \u2013\n\nAs Rosado explains, fentanyl is everywhere. It can be mixed with cocaine, heroin and even synthetic marijuana (sometimes known as K2). It can also be pressed into counterfeit pills.\n\nSometimes, the user doesn\u2019t even know he or she is taking it.\n\n\u201cA lot of times, people were overdosing off half of a five-dollar bag, so basically about two dollars worth was enough,\u201d said Rosado, 54.\n\nResult: every day in America, an average of 130 people die from opioid overdoses, according to government data.\n\nIn this relatively calm part of South Philly, the opioid epidemic is advancing, Rosado says.\n\nIn the city\u2019s Kensington neighborhood, people are using in the open, and many users are military veterans, but in South Philly, \u201ca lot of people are using behind closed doors,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cThey still function, they still have jobs and families.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Life-saving nasal spray \u2013\n\nThe fast-talking Rosado \u2014 who has been a counselor on drug and alcohol abuse for 25 years \u2014 reveals to the jewelry shop workers the first line of defense: identifying people in trouble.\n\n\u201cAny time you come across somebody who is extremely pale with a gurgling noise, blue-purplish (complexion)\u2026 those individuals have respiratory distress,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cCall 911 immediately and proceed to administer Narcan,\u201d he adds, referring to the brand-name version of naloxone in nasal spray form.\n\nThe next step is to assess whether the person is conscious, by shaking their foot or rubbing their chest \u2014 gestures that spark a reaction in anyone unless they are overdosing.\n\nIf the victim does not respond, hold their head back and inject a first dose of the easy-to-use spray, Rosado says, demonstrating on the mannequin.\n\nHe then shows how to administer other forms of naloxone \u2014 which include an auto-injector or a syringe.\n\nThe key is to get naloxone into the system of the victim as quickly as possible.\n\nIf the victim regains consciousness, he says, stay with the person until emergency workers arrive on the scene.\n\n\u201cNinety percent of the time, they\u2019ll look at you and say, \u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I don\u2019t do drugs\u2019,\u201d Rosado tells his class.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t argue with the person \u2014 just explain, \u2018We gave you Narcan\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u2013 5,000 people trained \u2013\n\nThe four employees of Souvenir Jewelry listen attentively to the presentation by Rosado, who has been clean for 27 years.\n\nHe has already offered naloxone training to more than 5,000 people including the governor of Pennsylvania, hundreds of students, cops, nuns and librarians.\n\nSo far, he has been responsible for reversing 60 opioid overdoses.\n\nBut in January, he lost one person.\n\nRachael Dillon, the 35-year-old owner of the store, raises an interesting point: can you get in trouble if you mistakenly give Narcan to someone who has not taken opioids?\n\nRosado is reassuring: \u201cYou can\u2019t hurt anyone with Narcan/naloxone\u2026 it\u2019s always better to do something than do nothing.\u201d\n\nThe demonstration ends in just 30 minutes. Dillon and her employees all say they feel capable of helping someone in need.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as simple as CPR,\u201d says Dillon. \u201cIt\u2019s something everybody should be prepared for because it is such a sweeping problem.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018People are dying\u2019 \u2013\n\nAt Souvenir Jewelry, Dillon needed no convincing of the usefulness of the seminar.\n\nEveryone at the shop has been affected by the opioid epidemic \u2014 either they have friends who ODed, or they used hard drugs themselves.\n\nRipley Nichols, 26, lives in the Kensington neighborhood, where users are seemingly everywhere.\n\n\u201cI have just always turned a blind eye to it,\u201d says Nichols. \u201cI am always alone on my bike and I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m just going to get home and keep myself safe\u2019.\u201d\n\nNichols says she and her friends \u201ccasually\u201d used opioids in high school but admitted \u201cit got way out of hand.\u201d\n\nOne of her best friends died at age 19 of an overdose. Another died at 21.\n\n\u201cI think this is why I blocked out the drug use around me here, because it was just so close to home,\u201d she explains.\n\n\u201cI think I am ready to carry Narcan on me\u2026 People are dying at a very young age.\u201d\n\nHer colleague Katie Jean, 33, has always shied away from alcohol and drugs.\n\nThe training was \u201csuper comforting,\u201d she says.\n\nShe once saw a friend leave a bar, shoot up and come back \u2014 she had never suspected the woman of being an addict. Two other friends overdosed a few years ago. One died.\n\n\u201cYou want to make sure you are there with resources and being able to have some kind of knowledge if something bad was to happen,\u201d Jean says.\n\n\u2013 More than 1,000 people saved \u2013\n\nEven if fentanyl is easily obtained, Rosado is still optimistic.\n\nLast year, he and other members of Prevention Point saved more than 500 people.\n\nOverall in Philadelphia, naloxone saved more than 1,000 in 2018, helping to reduce the number of fatal overdoses for the first time since 2013. That figure stood at 1,116, compared with 1,217 in 2017.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to realize it\u2019s something that is like a disease,\u201d says Jean.\n\n\u201cThe more conversations, the more education, the better we will be able to assist each other.\u201d", "description": "Philadelphia (AFP) \u2013 At a small shop selling handmade jewelry in South Philly, employees are skipping their lunch break for a good cause.
