I\u2019m the greatest, the world\u2019s most overrated,\u201d he told diners at the annual Alfred E Smith Memorial Foundation dinner.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honoured to be considered that by Donald Trump because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I guess I\u2019m the Meryl Streep of generals, and frankly that sounds pretty good to me.\u201d\n\nTrump lashed out at his former defence secretary on Wednesday during a contentious White House meeting with members of Congress.\n\nThe meeting was intended to be a bipartisan discussion of Trump\u2019s decision to pull US forces from northern Syria, but it broke up after a testy exchange between Trump and Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker.\n\nBefore the walkout, Trump disparaged Mattis, who had argued as defence secretary that US troops were needed in Syria to prevent a resurgence of Islamic State fighters.\n\nTrump said Mattis was \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general. You know why? He wasn\u2019t tough enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cI captured Isis,\u201d Trump went on to say.\n\nMattis resigned last December after Trump said he intended to pull 2,000 American troops out of Syria. In his resignation letter, the retired Marine general told Trump he had \u201cthe right to have a secretary of defence whose views are better aligned with yours\u201d.\n\nSince then, he has largely refrained from publicly criticising the administration, saying he owed the commander-in-chief \u201ca duty of silence\u201d.\n\nBut he did save an insult for Trump at the gala.\n\n\u201cI earned my spurs on the battlefield \u2026 and Donald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor,\u201d Mattis said.", "description": "Ex-defence secretary responds to US president calling him \u2018the world\u2019s most overrated general\u2019", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afc79b2910e9fd78256abf5103ae9dcd744044e3/0_28_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5b0c2f8b72c59cbcc24e3fab289f14c1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
