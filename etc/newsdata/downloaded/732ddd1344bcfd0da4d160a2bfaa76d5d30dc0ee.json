(Avalon.red via Newscom, FILE) More\n\nAt the time of the exchange, questions were already swirling about Trump's aid strategy. News broke in late August that nearly $400 million of security assistance had been put on hold by the White House.\n\nIn a Sept. 5 Washington Post editorial, the newspaper said it had received information Trump was \"attempting to force\" Ukraine's president \"to intervene in the 2020 U.S. presidential election by launching an investigation of the leading Democratic candidate, Joe Biden.\"\n\nAfter describing the prospect of Ukraine not getting the aid as a \"nightmare,\" Taylor says: \"I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\"\n\nThe diplomat who denied any 'quid pro quo' was a Trump megadonor\n\nSondland, the top U.S. representative to the European Union, swiftly knocks down Taylor's allegation with a formal-sounding statement.\n\n\"Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions,\" he writes via text. \"The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo's of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelenskiy promised during his campaign.\"\n\nPHOTO: U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon D.

He was confirmed by the Senate in 2018. They will also likely focus on his suggestion to Taylor to take the conversation offline.\n\nDems say they don't need to prove there was a 'quid pro quo'\n\nAt the heart of the Democrats' impeachment case is whether Trump asked a foreign leader to interfere in a U.S. election by investigating one of his political rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden and Biden's son, Hunter.\n\nWhether Trump withheld aid to encourage cooperation is certainly of interest. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told ABC News in an interview that Trump withholding aid before then pushing for a Biden investigation on the Ukraine call suggests there was a quid pro quo, or that he sought one.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Last month, three top U.S. diplomats used encrypted texts to discuss what one saw as a particularly troubling development: President Donald Trump had put a hold on hundreds of millions of military aid to Ukraine around the same time he was asking Ukraine for help investigating his political rival.", "authors": ["Anne Flaherty"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mvVMHG0ESfRg3yfQakg1kw--~B/aD01NTg7dz05OTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/gma/us.abcnews.go.com/william-taylor-nc-ps-191003_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
