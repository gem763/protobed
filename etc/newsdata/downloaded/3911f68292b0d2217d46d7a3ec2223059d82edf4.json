They have gone on strike for 48 hours, triggering the cancellation of almost all the airline\u2019s 1,700 flights to and from Heathrow and Gatwick on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThe travel plans of around 200,000 passengers have been disrupted.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Normally a significant proportion of passengers arriving at Heathrow on intercontinental flights early in the morning are transferring to other British Airways departures: to UK, European and more distant destinations.\n\nBy cancelling services that would normally land almost 15,000 passengers between them, BA is reducing the scale of problems at Heathrow.\n\nThe departure screens at Heathrow Terminal 5 are almost blank. Besides code-share flights operated by Iberia to Madrid, the only departures are to Tokyo and Cairo, with one inbound arrival expected from Edinburgh.\n\nAt Gatwick, the only service on Monday is to New York JFK, which is operated by a third-party airline, Evelop.\n\nIt is by far the biggest strike in the history of British Airways.\n\nBalpa says: \u201cBA made \u00a32bn profit in 2018. We are seeking to share in a tiny fraction of that huge profit.\n\n\u201cBA\u2019s belligerent attitude is going to cost them, their shareholders and their passengers far more than resolving this dispute via negotiation would.\u201d\n\nA British Airways spokesperson said: \u201cWe understand the frustration and disruption Balpa\u2019s strike action has caused our customers. After many months of trying to resolve the pay dispute, we are extremely sorry that it has come to this.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, with no detail from Balpa on which pilots would strike, we had no way of predicting how many would come to work or which aircraft they are qualified to fly, so we had no option but to cancel nearly 100 per cent of our flights.\n\n\u201cWe remain ready and willing to return to talks with Balpa.\u201d\n\nRail and Underground links to Heathrow Terminal 5 are operating normally, but with almost no passengers between the central part of the airport and BA\u2019s main terminal. Only seven passengers travelled on the first Heathrow Express arrival at Terminal 5 from London Paddington.\n\nThe British Airways check-in area is almost devoid of passengers. Most were told two weeks ago their flights were cancelled.\n\nBut one perplexed traveller, Teresa McKeon, arrived from Perth on the 17-hour nonstop Qantas flight unaware that her onward connection to Dublin had been grounded. She had been in Australia for a month.\n\nAs British Airways staff tried to find a seat for Ms McKeon on an Aer Lingus flight, she shrugged and said: \u201cUsually when I travel, things go disastrously wrong.\u201d\n\nRetailers and catering outlets at what is usually Heathrow\u2019s busiest terminal will be racking up losses \u2013 but nothing like on the scale of British Airways.\n\nThe airline is set to lose up to \u00a3100m on the first two days of Balpa\u2019s planned strikes.\n\nAnother stoppage is planned for 27 September. And, in a move that will unsettle passengers with future bookings on BA, and benefit rival airlines, the pilots\u2019 union warned: \u201cOur industrial action ballot is valid until January. Further strike dates may be announced.\u201d", "description": "The dawn skies around Heathrow are far quieter than normal.
