The language he used is offensive, hurtful and unacceptable,\" a spokesperson for Executive Producer Lorne Michaels said.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/22/ae/7e60d6384f7a9ada12fe622e6aed/yangregular.png\"\n\nYang said quickly he disagreed with the decision. \u201cAs a society, we have become unduly punitive and vindictive about people making statements that some find offensive or distasteful,\u201d he said outside a campaign rally as news of Gillis\u2019 firing started to spread.\n\nYang also told POLITICO that while he might give comedians and entertainers more leeway, he does draw the line between a misstatement in a comedic context and true advocacy of racist ideas.\n\n\u201cThat to me is beyond the pale and people should face consequences,\u201d Yang said.\n\nYang has faced backlash for his defense of Gillis, but he isn\u2019t changing course.\n\n\u201cShane Gillis reached out,\u201d Yang recently tweeted . \u201cLooks like we\u2019ll be sitting down together soon.\u201d", "description": "Yang said he disagreed with SNL's decision.", "authors": ["Eugene Daniels"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9b/b2/d6c934e240b2b4d64e98ed72c9a7/yangnowords2.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
