It's also the time for weekend projects. We've all used summer weekends to stain our decks, install new fire pits, and mulch our yards.\n\nBut summer is a good time to take on some basic money projects, too.\n\nWhy now? This time of year, most of us aren't knee-deep in the details of our finances. During the summer, we're not usually paying our taxes, funding IRAs, taking RMDs, conducting portfolios reviews/rebalancing, or maneuvering open enrollment. So why not take a little time to evaluate how we\u2019re managing--or not managing--some larger money and financial issues before the busyness of fall?\n\nTo that end, we've created this special report, Weekend Money Projects. Each weekend between now and Labor Day, I'll guide you through one must-do money task.\n\nHere's what you can expect. Be sure to visit Morningstar.com each weekend. And before the days shorten and the leaves begin to turn, you'll have your money foundation all set.\n\nJune 22: Calculate Your Net Worth\n\nJune 29: Assess Cash Flows and Create a Budget\n\nJuly 6: Quantify and Set Goals\n\nJuly 13: Calibrate Your Target Savings Rate\n\nJuly 20: Assess Your Insurance Needs\n\nJuly 27: Set and Invest Your Emergency Fund\n\nAug. 3: How to Develop a Plan for Paying Down Debt\n\nAug. 10: Create an Investment Policy Statement\n\nAug. 17: Create a Master Directory\n\nAug. 24: Get Organized\n\nAug. 31: Tackle Estate-Planning Basics", "description": "Use this summer series to cross some financial tasks off your list before fall.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/blt8870afe34c82af68/5c76b9ca763b502362e52b21/ChristineBenz_1x1.jpg"}
