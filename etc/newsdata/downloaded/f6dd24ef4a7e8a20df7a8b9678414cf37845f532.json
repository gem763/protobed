The advisory, released Wednesday, gave the states its highest-risk Category 4 warning, the same classification the U.S. has given conflict-racked nations such as Libya and Yemen.\n\nViolence has been on the rise across Mexico in recent years. Last year, the nation recorded more homicides than in any year since the government began releasing statistics in 1997. But the bloodshed has been concentrated in certain areas.\n\nHere is a breakdown of what is happening in each of the five Mexican states on the State Department\u2019s list \u2014 and why the U.S. thinks citizens should stay away.\n\nMexican soldiers march past the incineration of 23.5 tons of cocaine in Manzanillo, in Colima state.

The city of Manzanillo, on the Pacific coast, boasts one of Mexico\u2019s busiest ports, while the city\u2019s beaches have long drawn both domestic tourists and international cruise ships.\n\nHomicide rate: 83 deaths per 100,000 people in the first 11 months of 2017.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening: Rival cartels have been battling for control of Manzanillo\u2019s port, a primary point of entry for drugs from South and Central America as well as for precursor chemicals coming from Asia that are used to manufacture synthetic drugs. \u201cViolent crime and gang activity are widespread,\u201d the U.S. warned in its travel advisory. \u201cDo not travel.\u201d\n\nA Mexican federal police officer detains a man after a shootout broke out between police and gunmen on a central avenue in downtown Acapulco on Nov. 12, 2017. Bernandino Hernandez / Associated Press\n\nGuerrero\n\nKnown for: One of Mexico\u2019s poorest states, Guerrero is home to what was once the country\u2019s poshest resort. Acapulco, set on a bay surrounded by high rises and the Sierra Madre del Sur, used to attract Hollywood stars and Mexico\u2019s elite.\n\nHomicide rate: 59 deaths per 100,000 people in the first 11 months of 2017.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening: The cartel that once dominated Acapulco and the rest of the state fractured years ago, leaving smaller criminal groups to violently vie for power. There are more than a dozen gangs fighting in Acapulco, which is now Mexico\u2019s homicide capital. Up in the Tierra Caliente, a region that encompasses parts of northern Guerrero and neighboring Michoacan state, gangs have been battling for control of poppy production. Poppy grown in Guerrero and other states has made Mexico the No. 1 exporter of heroin to the U.S.\n\n\u201cArmed groups operate independently of the government in many areas of Guerrero,\u201d the U.S. warned in its travel advisory, adding that members of those groups \u201cfrequently maintain roadblocks and may use violence towards travelers.\u201d\n\nMembers of Cheran's Forest Police patrol the woods outside town to prevent illegal logging.

It is also a top sender of migrants to the U.S.\n\nHomicide rate: 59 deaths per 100,000 people in the first 11 months of 2017.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening: Violence erupted in Michoacan starting in the mid-2000s, as cartels battling for control of methamphetamine production expanded to extortion and kidnapping. The government\u2019s failure to bring order spawned a citizen vigilante movement, and to this day, masked citizen police roam the state. In some towns, they have taken over local governments.\n\nPeople take photos of slain journalist Javier Valdez on May 15, 2017, in Culiacan, Mexico.

Fernando Brito / Associated Press\n\nSinaloa\n\nKnown for: A long, skinny state that hugs the Pacific coast, Sinaloa is known for its ample agricultural production and as the birthplace of banda \u2014 a beloved musical genre heavy on brass and percussion. It was also the birthplace of Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman , a poor kid who sold oranges in the street before becoming Mexico\u2019s most infamous drug cartel leader.\n\nHomicide rate: 41 deaths per 100,000 people in the first 11 months of 2017.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening: After Guzman\u2019s arrest and extradition to the U.S. last year, his Sinaloa cartel fragmented into warring factions. Those factions are fighting each other as well as well as gangsters aligned with the ascendant Jalisco New Generation cartel, which has quickly taken control of wide swaths of the country with its brutal tactics.\n\n\u201cViolent crime is widespread,\u201d the U.S. warned in its travel advisory for Sinaloa.\n\nPackages of U.S. cash were found hidden in a bus crossing Mexico's Tamaulipas state this month. More than $980,000 was seized. Mexican navy\n\nTamaulipas\n\nKnown for: A border state located on Mexico\u2019s Gulf coast, Tamaulipas has long been defined by its proximity to the United States. A large amount of Mexican trade travels through the state, and U.S. citizens frequently cross into Matamoros and Reynosa, across the border from Brownsville and McAllen, Texas, respectively.\n\nHomicide rate: 20 deaths per 100,000 people in the first 11 months of 2017.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening: Tamaulipas has been engulfed in violence between factions of the Gulf cartel and the Zetas criminal group. While the homicide rate there is not as high as in other states, extortion and kidnappings are rampant. About one-fourth of all kidnappings in Mexico occur in the state.\n\n\u201cViolent crime, such as murder, armed robbery, carjacking, kidnapping, extortion and sexual assault, is common,\u201d the U.S. travel advisory said, adding that armed criminal groups have targeted public and private passenger buses traveling through the state, \u201coften taking passengers hostage and demanding ransom payments.\u201d\n\n\u201cLocal law enforcement has limited capability to respond to violence,\u201d the advisory warned.\n\nTo read the article in Spanish, click here\n\nSupport our journalism Please consider subscribing today to support stories like this one.
