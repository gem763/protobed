There is a 22.9% APR if you don\u2019t fully repay,\" Martin told viewers of This Morning on Monday.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need to spend \u00a33,000 or more a year on it to get any cashback. Though remember Amex isn\u2019t accepted in quite as many places as Visa and Mastercard.\u201d\n\nIf that seems a bit much, there are other options too.\n\nMr Lewis said: \u201cNew M&S Reward cardholders get 2,000 bonus M&S points worth \u00a320 if you spend anything on the card in the first 90 days.\n\n\"Plus there\u2019s a 500 bonus point voucher for M&S spending, so buy a banana in M&S and you\u2019ve made \u00a325. There is 19.9% APR if you don\u2019t fully repay.\n\n\u201cAs well as paying cashback on all spending, the Tandem credit card is a specialist cheap overseas card.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t add the usual 3% exchange rate fee and you\u2019ll get the same near-perfect exchange rate the banks do when you spend on it overseas. There is 18.9% APR if you don\u2019t fully repay.\u201d\n\nBut while offering a little extra for not much work, Martin did have a couple of warnings.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nFirstly, the best cards are only available to people with good credit scores - so if possible use an eligibility checker before applying.\n\nThat's because applying for a lot of cards at once, especially if you're rejected, can make you look desperate to lenders and therefor hurt your credit ratings further.\n\nBut the biggest warning was to come.\n\n\"The most important thing to do is neuter your credit card's ability to charge you interest, and turn it into a pure transaction card,\" Martin told subscribers of the weekly MoneySavingExpert.com newsletter last month.\n\n\"Preferably do it by direct debit, so you never forget to make repayments. Also, never withdraw cash. Do that and the card is free, and you're paid to spend.\"\n\nHe added: \"If you have impulse control issues or don't trust yourself, don't risk switching to a credit card - getting yourself into a steaming pile of unneeded debt is a bigger risk than a lack of protection.\"", "description": "Speaking on This Morning, Martin Lewis has explained exactly which cards to sign up to for the biggest rewards - and used right they can make you hundreds extra a year", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article4800317.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Martin-Lewis.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
