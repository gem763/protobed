CLARY/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt was supposed to be Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s big debut on the world stage.\n\nInstead, the newly elected Ukrainian president\u2019s appearance at the United Nations General Assembly this week was overshadowed by his entanglement in a massive political scandal in Washington \u2014 one in which it was revealed Zelensky made unflattering comments about his European allies.\n\nA July 25 phone call between Zelensky and President Trump is now at the center of a whistleblower complaint that has pitted Congress against the White House and prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nThe White House released a rough transcript of the call on Wednesday, around the same time Zelensky, a political newcomer, addressed the General Assembly, creating an awkward situation for the Ukrainian leader, who criticized some European counterparts in the call.\n\nHe said later that day that he did not realize the White House intended to publish his side of the conversation. \u201cThey said they wanted to publish. I just thought they would publish their part,\u201d the comedian-turned-president said at a news conference at the U.N.\n\nOleksiy Goncharenko, a Ukrainian opposition lawmaker from Poroshenko\u2019s party, has submitted a request to Zelensky\u2019s office for them to release their own transcript of the call, Reuters reported.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Goncharenko called it \u201cstrange that the [Ukrainian] President\u2019s Office did not publish this transcript simultaneously with the White House.\u201d\n\nAccording to the White House memo describing the call, Trump said the United States has been \u201cvery very good to Ukraine,\u201d and slammed European countries for allegedly not doing enough, saying \u201cGermany does almost nothing for you.\u201d\n\nZelensky replied by saying Trump was \u201cabsolutely right. Not only 100 percent, but actually 1000 percent.\u201d He praised Trump and went on to say that he met both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron and told them: \u201cThey are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThose comments were not well-received in Europe.\n\n\u201cTo say that I consider this to be incomprehensible would perhaps be a mild way to put it,\u201d Elmar Brok, who was recently appointed special Adviser on Ukraine for outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, told The Washington Post on Thursday.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments, Brok said, were \u201cfactually completely inaccurate.\u201d\n\nBrok pointed to a free-trade agreement between the E.U. and Ukraine, which he said has boosted Ukrainian exports to the E.U. in recent years. The United States has not struck a similar agreement with Ukraine.\n\nAnd since 2014, the E.U. and European financial institutions have also mobilized more than $16 billion in loans and grants for Ukraine, E.U. officials said Thursday.\n\n\u201cIn these five years, we have put together for Ukraine the largest support package in the history of the European Union,\u201d Carlos Martin Ruiz de Gordejuela, a spokesman for the European Commission, said at a news conference, but declined to comment specifically on the July call between Trump and Zelensky.\n\nAfter they discussed European support for Ukraine, the memo describing the July phone call shows that Trump pressed Zelensky to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney General for an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s involvement in Ukraine during his time in office.\n\nBiden, who is now a front-runner for the 2020 Democratic nomination for president, threatened to withhold aid from Ukraine unless a top prosecutor was fired, citing allegations the prosecutor was not cracking down on corruption. It was the same position a number of other western countries took at the time. Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, was serving on the board of a Ukrainian gas company that had been scrutinized by Ukrainian authorities, but no evidence has emerged that Biden pushed for the prosecutor to step down to benefit his son.\n\nThe anonymous whistleblower raised concerns that Trump used his position as president to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden, one of Trump\u2019s political rivals, ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nBrok said Trump\u2019s alleged suggestion to \u201cuse [Ukraine\u2019s] judiciary for political purposes\u201d was \u201cinsanity\u201d \u2014 especially after years of Western efforts to strengthen Ukraine\u2019s rule of law, he added.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how this can be topped,\u201d Brok said, referring to the political damage he said Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine have created.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Wednesday, Zelensky seemed intent on walking back some of the criticism he expressed privately to Trump in July, saying \u201cE.U. countries help us tremendously.\u201d\n\nGustav Gressel, acting director of the wider Europe program at the European Council on Foreign Relations said that it was common knowledge even before the transcript was released that Zelensky had some personal grievances against Merkel.\n\nShortly before the April presidential vote in Ukraine, Merkel invited then-Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko to Berlin, but did not invite Zelensky. \u201cThe Germans know that Zelensky took this personally,\u201d Gressel said, adding that the relationship between the two countries has improved since the time of the phone call.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of embarrassment in the diplomatic sphere, but then again, if you engage with Trump you have to expect embarrassment,\u201d Gressel said.\n\nBrok also defended Zelensky, saying that when he recently spoke with the Ukrainian leader and other top Ukrainian officials, he left with a more positive impression of Ukraine\u2019s perspective on E.U. support than what the White House memo shows of the July call.\n\nHe said Zelensky may have agreed with Trump in July because \u201cas a Ukrainian president he does not want to ruin relations with any U.S. president, given [Ukraine\u2019s] security situation.\u201d\n\nAndrew Weiss, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said he doesn\u2019t expect \u201ca single phone call and glib attempts to build a rapport with Donald Trump\u201d to significantly damage Ukrainian-European relations.\n\nStill, he said, \u201cbeing sucked into a U.S. political crisis the scale of which hasn\u2019t been seen since the Watergate era is a net negative for any country.\u201d\n\nQuentin Ari\u00e8s contributed from Brussels.\n\nRead more:\n\n7 takeaways from the rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s president\n\nWhistleblower claimed Trump abused his office and that White House officials tried to cover it up\n\nTrump\u2019s other Ukraine problem: New concern about his business", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of embarrassment in the diplomatic sphere, but then again, if you engage with Trump you have to expect embarrassment,\" one analyst said.", "authors": ["Siobh\u00e1n O'Grady", "Staff Writer", "Foreign Desk", "Rick Noack", "Foreign Affairs Reporter Focusing On Europe", "International Security", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/oSqTzMwwGlCn_dyqMwKZNEX3ze0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E6IG2VXASUI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
