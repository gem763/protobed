Not that I thought it was a hoax or anything, just that it seemed much more like a 30 Rock parody than an actual movie someone spent millions of dollars on. Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones, reuniting for another British period piece five years after The Theory of Everything? In a movie about Victorian hot-air balloonists? Called, again, The Aeronauts? Sure. Tell me, how is Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s performance as Lord Worthington?\n\nBut having seen the film\u2019s Canadian premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival this weekend, I can confirm: The Aeronauts is not just real, it is occasionally spectacular. Not spectacular as in excellent, mind you, or even amazeballs, which Google inexplicably lists among the synonyms. I\u2019m talking spectacular as in full of spectacle, which is a distinction you come to appreciate while watching The Aeronauts.\n\nSaying The Aeronauts is spectacular is also different from saying The Aeronauts is not the kind of movie you think it is, because it absolutely is. This is a movie where Redmayne\u2019s scientist glumly tells Jones, \u201cI cannot quantify what you\u2019ve lost,\u201d and wistfully says, \u201cMy hygrometer has seen better days.\u201d A movie where Redmayne\u2019s haughty science rivals chuckle when they say \u201cmeteorologist,\u201d then chuckle harder when they say \u201cwoman.\u201d A movie where every supporting character, no matter how good or evil, walks around with a beard covering 83 percent of their face.\n\nThe plot, if you weren\u2019t immediately sold on \u201cFelicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne in a Victorian hot-air-balloon survival epic\u201d: Jones plays Amelia Wren, an experienced balloon pilot who was once married to a French aeronaut. (That a character played by Felicity Jones has a name that sounds like \u201cEmilia\u201d is \u2026 rough.) Redmayne plays scientist James Glaisher, who is married to his scientific instruments, which he dreams of taking up into the sky so that he might one day be able to predict the weather. Together, they venture into the upper reaches of the troposphere, where they hope to break the record for highest human ascent ever recorded, and also maybe learn some fun things about clouds.\n\nDirector Tom Harper has fun contrasting the buttoned-up Glaisher with the relatively free-spirited (for a Victorian) Wren, who knows that to be a true aeronaut, you\u2019ve got to give the people a little razzle-dazzle. It\u2019s a lesson the movie\u2019s also learned. These aviation pioneers have barely gotten off the ground before they\u2019re caught in a terrible storm, and things only get worse from there. Like a 19th-century Gravity, the film throws every possible obstacle a hot-air balloon could face into the mix \u2014 save maybe a run-in with a flock of birds, which merely gets mentioned. Besides the storm, our aeronauts also have to deal with hypoxia, hypothermia, fluctuating pressure systems, and busted valves, plus the constant danger of falling thousands of feet to their deaths. (The mission in the movie is a highly fictionalized amalgamation of various early balloon flights.) As they ascend, Harper goes wider and wider with his lenses, a witty touch that helps distract from the copious CGI, and also makes you think the actors might soon break into \u201cOne Day More.\u201d The crowd at the Roy Thomson Hall had a few more empty spaces than at other TIFF premieres, but that helped give those that were there the feeling of having entered a special club. By the film\u2019s audacious, high-wire-act climax, the audience was rapt \u2014 it felt like you could hear every single gasp. We were onboard, as the aeronauts risked tumbling off it.\n\nUnfortunately, half of The Aeronauts takes place outside the balloon, and it\u2019s these ground-bound scenes that weigh the movie down like so many bags of sand. The balloonists themselves are much less interesting than the perils they face, mostly a collection of tragic backstories and would-be inspirational speeches about how they\u2019ve \u201cbrought the stars closer.\u201d I don\u2019t care about incremental scientific advances; I just want to see Felicity Jones mend a hot-air balloon while a frozen Eddie Redmayne nearly succumbs to altitude sickness!\n\nStill, the movie gives us that and then some. Since the project was announced, it\u2019s been easy to clown on The Aeronauts, and after the premiere, well, it\u2019s still easy to clown on The Aeronauts. But from scrolling through reactions from those who had traveled with me in our own metaphorical wicker basket, I think I\u2019ve noticed one more distinction: Some of the teasing, it now seems, is tinged with love.", "description": "Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne star in a biopic of Victorian hot-air balloonists, a sentence that describes the real movie \u201cThe Aeronauts\u201d and not a \u201c30 Rock\u201d parody.", "authors": ["Nate Jones"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/09/09-the-aeronauts.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
