U.S. EPA granted full biofuel waivers to refineries despite Energy Dept advice: memo", "language": "en", "text": "(Reuters) - (This story corrects paragraph 14 spelling of senator\u2019s name.)\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency granted some refineries full waivers from biofuels regulation for the 2018 compliance year, even though the Department of Energy had recommended partial exemptions, according to an EPA memo seen by Reuters.\n\nThe decision upset the powerful U.S. corn lobby, already angry at the Trump administration\u2019s move in August to grant 31 full exemptions to refineries, freeing them from an at-times costly obligation to use biofuels such as corn-based ethanol.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates also seized on the administration\u2019s use of waivers on Tuesday, calling them a giveaway to the oil industry that hurts farmers already struggling from the effects of the U.S. trade war with China.\n\nThe issue shows how President Donald Trump has struggled to simultaneously please the corn and oil industries, key political constituencies leading into next year\u2019s presidential election that have routinely clashed over future biofuels policy.\n\nThe Aug. 9 memo showed the EPA granted \u201cfull exemptions for those 2018 small refinery petitions where DOE recommended 50% relief.\u201d\n\nThe memo, signed by Anne Idsal, EPA\u2019s acting assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation, did not specify how many refineries were involved.\n\nTrump\u2019s EPA has disregarded DOE advice on waivers in the past, Reuters has reported, marking a break from the Obama administration\u2019s EPA, which had often either adopted energy department recommendations or, when it did not, ruled against exempting oil refiners.\n\nAn EPA official did not immediately comment.\n\nAgency officials and oil industry representatives have defended the EPA\u2019s expanded use of waivers under the Trump administration, saying they protect refining jobs and there is no evidence they have any impact on ethanol demand.\n\n\u201cSmall refinery exemptions are a critical lifeline for small refineries across the U.S.,\u201d said a spokesman for the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers refining group.\n\nBut biofuel industry representatives called the memo evidence the agency is biased in favour of the oil industry.\n\n\u201cGranting favours to refiners that aren\u2019t really facing an economic hardship is just one of the multiple problems with EPA\u2019s handling of small refinery exemptions,\u201d said Kurt Kovarik, vice president of federal affairs for the National Biodiesel Board, on the sidelines of an industry event.\n\n\u201cThe memo clearly shows that EPA continues to disregard the recommendations of DOE,\u201d Geoff Cooper, head of the Renewable Fuels Association industry group, said in an email.\n\nIn a clear sign the issue has become a potential political vulnerability for Trump, White House hopeful Democratic Senator Cory Booker seized on the news of the memo, calling the administration\u2019s use of the waiver program an \u201cabuse of power.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cTime and time again, this president and his administration have used their power to prop up their political allies, like oil companies, at the expense of hardworking American farmers, and now, they\u2019re doing it against the advice of their own Department of Energy.\u201d\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg also mentioned small refinery waivers on Tuesday during a campaign stop in Iowa, calling them \u201cbig giveaways to oil,\u201d drawing applause from his crowd.\n\nThe U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard requires oil refineries to blend biofuels, such as corn-based ethanol, into their fuel or purchase credits from those that do.\n\nThe law is intended to help farmers and cut U.S. dependence on foreign oil but refiners say it costs them a fortune.\n\nThe RFS, however, allows the EPA to grant waivers from the regulation to small refining facilities of 75,000 barrels per day or less, if they can prove that compliance would cause them disproportionate economic hardship.\n\nThis process sees the DOE assess applications and provide recommendations to the EPA, which then makes a final decision.\n\nWhile the EPA publishes the number of waiver applicants and recipients each year, it keeps their identities secret, arguing the information is business-sensitive.\n\nSince Trump took office, the EPA has vastly expanded its use of the exemptions, providing waivers to small facilities owned by billionaire investor Carl Icahn and oil majors, such as Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N), Reuters has reported.\n\nUnder pressure over the most recent round of 31 waivers, Trump last month promised a \u201cgiant package\u201d to farmers to boost the market for ethanol. That plan has yet to be released.", "description": "(This story corrects paragraph 14 spelling of senator's name.)", "authors": ["Jarrett Renshaw", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
