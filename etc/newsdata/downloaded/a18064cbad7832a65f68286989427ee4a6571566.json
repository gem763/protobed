I have to wait for the exact right one.\"\n\nAnd that club could be Tottenham, according to the Mail .\n\nThe publication claims Mourinho is open to the idea of managing the north London club should Pochettino leave.\n\n(Image: Mark Pain/PA Images Contributor)\n\nHe has turned down job offers from Benfica and Chinese Super League side Guangzhou Evergrande as he waits for the right club.\n\nTottenham, of course, were Champions League finalists last season, and started the season among the favourites to yet again secure a top-four spot - although recent results in both the premier league and in Europe's elite competition have somewhat undermined their challenge for honours.\n\nSaturday's shock 3-0 defeat away to Brighton followed last Tuesday's 7-2 thrashing at home to Bayern Munich, increasing the pressure on Pochettino.\n\nQuestion marks were raised over Pochettino's future in the lead-up to last season's Champions League final defeat to Liverpool . The Argentine said he could quit Tottenham if they won Europe's biggest prize as it would have been the ultimate achievement for his five years at the club.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe summer of transfer speculation which followed has been viewed as having unsettled Spurs' squad, with Christian Eriksen having made it clear he wants to leave the club.\n\nIt is believed that Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy will not sack Mourinho - with the manager set to receive \u00a332m compensation if he gets the boot.\n\nBut if Pochettino does leave, then a door could open for Mourinho to once again test his managerial mettle in the Premier League.", "description": "Former Man Utd and Real Madrid boss is waiting for a job that is 'the same level' that he is as a manager", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Sky Sports", "Mark Pain Pa Images Contributor", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20319755.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_DDP_CHP__1107joseJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
