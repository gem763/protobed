Free.\n\nIt\u2019s likely far from the last fan protest to come at an NBA game over the Hong Kong issue.\n\nA GoFundMe page started two days ago has halted receipt of donations after taking in just under $43,000 \u2014 more than twice the target goal \u2014 to print and give away T-shirts outside the Staples Center in Los Angeles before the October 22 NBA opening-night showdown between the city rival Lakers and Clippers, each expected to contend for the league crown.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be hilarious if on opening night in Staples Center the NBA fanbase made a collective demonstration against censorship by wearing \u201cStand With Hong Kong\u201d T-shirts?\u201d asks page founder Sun Lared.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 A sign-waving couple who yelled \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d repeatedly near the bench of a Chinese team at a pre-season NBA game", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/980d45_australian-ben-simmons-sparked-philadelphia-76ers-an-nba-pre-season-victory-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
