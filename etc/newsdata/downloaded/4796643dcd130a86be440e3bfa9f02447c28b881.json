He was charged with statutory sexual assault, unlawful contact with a minor and corruption of minors and a misdemeanor count of indecent assault of a person under 16 years old.\n\nPITTSBURGH PIRATES CLOSER FELIPE V\u00c1ZQUEZ ARRESTED FOR ALLEGED SOLICITATION OF CHILD\n\nThe 28-year-old met with the alleged victim at the Pirates\u2019 home ballpark after she contacted the pitcher on social media beginning their communication, according to a Lee County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Fla., incident report obtained by CBS Pittsburgh.\n\nVazquez reportedly drove to the alleged victim\u2019s home in Pennsylvania on at least one occasion. She accused the pitcher of pulling down her pants while they were in his vehicle and attempted to have sex with her, CBS Pittsburgh reported, citing the incident report.\n\nThe girl, now 15, allegedly received a text message from Vazquez in July in which he was performing a sexual act. He also texted the girl to ask if she wanted to meet for a sexual encounter at the end of the baseball season, police said.\n\nRETIRED MLB STAR DAVID ORTIZ RECOUNTS BEING SHOT IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: 'I WANT TO FIND OUT WHO DID THIS'\n\nVazquez\u2019s face was not visible in the sexual images sent to the alleged victim and authorities were able to identify him by matching tattoos in the picture against the tattoos of Vazquez they discovered on the internet, the Associated Press reported, citing an affidavit.\n\nThe alleged victim\u2019s mother discovered the messages with Vazquez and told the pitcher he was talking with a minor, according to the affidavit.

He was later charged in Westmoreland County, which is located east of Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Florida Department of Law Enforcement said it began investigating Vazquez in August after learning about an alleged sexual relationship between a girl and Vazquez. The girl was 13 at the time of the alleged relationship.\n\nVazquez was denied bond as the judge said she believed he was as a flight risk, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.\n\nVazquez has since been placed on paid administrative leave.\n\n\u201cWe take this matter, and these charges in particular, extremely seriously,\u201d Pirates president Frank Connelly said in a statement.\n\nPirates starting pitcher Chris Archer commented on Vazquez\u2019s arrest Tuesday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cIt's something that hits home,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a 14-year-old sister. In the U.S., you're innocent until proven guilty. Until due process is completely played out, we're hoping that this stuff's not true.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "All-Star pitcher Felipe Vazquez, who was arrested Tuesday and charged with multiple felony child sex charges, reportedly met the alleged victim at PNC Park and took pictures with her outside the bullpen.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News.
