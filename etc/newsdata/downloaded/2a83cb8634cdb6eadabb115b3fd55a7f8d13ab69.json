Other details were not immediately available. Ms. Harper had successfully battled lung cancer but revealed in 2013 a new diagnosis of brain cancer. In public, she long continued to display the pluck that had endeared her to millions of TV viewers for generations.\n\nMs. Harper amassed four Emmys during her time as Rhoda \u2014 three for her sidekick role on \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d which aired on CBS from 1970 to 1977, and one as the lead character in the spinoff \u201cRhoda,\u201d which ran from 1974 to 1978 on the same network.\n\nShe continued to act on television and in the theater for more than three decades, her stage roles ranging from the flamboyant actress Tallulah Bankhead to former Israeli prime minister Golda Meir. But she was forever known as Rhoda \u2014 a reflection of the preservative power of reruns, and the enduring appeal of her signature character.\n\nRhoda appeared in the first episode of \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d one of the earliest television programs to feature single working women. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna make it after all\u201d became the promise of its theme song.\n\nMs. Harper played the down-on-her-luck, down-on-herself single Jewish girl who had left the Bronx for Minneapolis \u2014 \u201cwhere it\u2019s cold,\u201d Rhoda later explains, \u201cand I figured I\u2019d keep better.\u201d\n\n\n\nMs. Harper, right, appears with Mary Tyler Moore, left, and Cloris Leachman, center, on \u201dThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d (AP)\n\n(Many observers have remarked on the fact that, unlike Rhoda, Ms. Harper was neither Jewish nor from the Bronx. She said she based her portrayal of Rhoda in part on her Italian American stepmother.)\n\nRhoda meets Mary Richards, played by the show\u2019s namesake, when Mary moves into the turreted Victorian house where Rhoda has fashioned a home in the attic, fringe beads tinkling in the doorway. In short order, they become bosom friends and foils.\n\n\u201cMare,\u201d as Rhoda calls her buddy, is a Midwestern sweetheart, the perfect one with a gorgeous figure and glamorous job as a local television producer. Rhoda, a department store window dresser, is the dumpy one with bad luck in love and a predilection for food.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re having a lousy streak,\u201d Rhoda says to Mary in one episode, coaching her friend through a rare rough spot. \u201cI happen to be having a terrific streak. Soon the world will be back to normal. Tomorrow you will meet a crown head of Europe and marry. I will have a fat attack, eat 3,000 peanut butter cups and die.\u201d\n\nAs the show continued, Ms. Harper slimmed down and turned herself \u2014 and Rhoda \u2014 into a knockout beauty, fantastic in headscarves and hoop earrings. She credited \u201cMary Tyler Moore Show\u201d actor Gavin MacLeod with turning her on to Weight Watchers. Moore, she said, encouraged the transformation.\n\n\n\nMs. Harper, right, and Mary Tyler Moore, shown here in 1999, reprise their roles as Rhoda Morgenstern and Mary Richards. (Eric Liebowitz/ABC)\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be my sidekick all your life,\u201d Ms. Harper recalled her saying.\n\nWith her spinoff show, Ms. Harper transitioned to leading lady. The first episode of \u201cRhoda\u201d sailed to the top of the Nielsen ratings \u2014 an extraordinary feat for a new program. In the first season, Rhoda returns to New York, is reunited with her family and finally snags a guy, demolition man Joe Gerard (played by David Groh).\n\nTheir 1974 television marriage was one of the most hyped and widely watched television events of the era. But the show\u2019s popularity gradually dimmed, and it was noted that viewers seemed to prefer Rhoda before she had come into her own. Joe was written out of the program through a breakup, and the show ended not long after.\n\nIn a way, the divorce was one more example of the frailty that made Rhoda so real. \u201cA good friend once put it best,\u201d Ms. Harper told the Chicago Tribune. \u201cMary Richards is the woman you wish you were. Rhoda is the woman you probably are.\u201d\n\nChorus parts\n\nValerie Kathryn Harper was born Aug. 22, 1939, in Suffern, N.Y. She moved around as a child, following her father in his career as a lighting salesman. Her parents later divorced.\n\nShe danced from an early age and, as a teenager, got a part at New York\u2019s Radio City Music Hall corps de ballet twirling about behind the Rockettes. She later scored chorus parts in Broadway productions including \u201cTake Me Along\u201d (with Jackie Gleason) and \u201cWildcat\u201d (with Lucille Ball).\n\nIn 1964, Ms. Harper married Richard Schaal, a member of the Second City improvisational theater company. She, too, joined the troupe and moved with Schaal to Los Angeles, where he succeeded while she stagnated.\n\n\u201cThings were going well for Dick,\u201d Ms. Harper told Time magazine, \u201cbut I just sat in Laurel Canyon sobbing and eating Sara Lee cakes all day.\u201d\n\nAll of that changed when she auditioned for \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show.\u201d Ms. Harper had relatively little television experience at the time, and more than 50 actresses tried out for the part, according to Time magazine. When Ms. Harper appeared, there was no question. \u201cThat\u2019s Rhoda,\u201d Moore was reported to have said.\n\nSchaal appeared in \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d as several characters, including Chuckles the Clown \u2014 whose demise is recounted in the 1975 episode \u201cChuckles Bites the Dust,\u201d widely considered one of the funniest episodes in television history. He and Ms. Harper later divorced.\n\nIn 1987, she married producer Tony Cacciotti. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.\n\nFrom 1986 to 1987, Ms. Harper played the wife of an airline pilot in \u201cValerie,\u201d a popular NBC sitcom that was renamed \u201cThe Hogan Family\u201d after Ms. Harper was fired from the show over a dispute with the production company.\n\nA jury later decided that she was wrongfully terminated and awarded her more than $1 million in damages as well as a portion of profits from the show.\n\nMs. Harper was the author of \u201cToday I Am a Ma\u2019am and Other Musings On Life, Beauty, and Growing Older\u201d (2001) and a memoir, \u201cI, Rhoda\u201d (2013). In 2002, she lost to actress Melissa Gilbert in a campaign for president of the Screen Actors Guild.\n\nThere were efforts over the years to revive the fun and friendship of the turreted house in Minneapolis, among them a lackluster TV movie \u201cMary and Rhoda\u201d (2000) that reintroduced Mary as a congressman\u2019s widow and Ms. Harper as the ex-wife of a Frenchman.\n\nMs. Harper professed her satisfaction at having been, from the beginning of her career until the end, one and the same with Rhoda Morgenstern. For she knew that the appeal of an imperfect, lovable single girl would never fade. Rhoda will be there \u201cwhen I\u2019m long gone,\u201d Ms. Harper once said, \u201cand that\u2019s a wonderful thing.\u201d", "description": "She won four Emmys on \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d and the spinoff \u201cRhoda.\u201d", "authors": ["Emily Langer", "Obituary Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nYRpphz2CqtaItXLqf7WfFdOT3w=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LBBFOAVOFQI6TFARUYEPTUGC2M.jpg"}
