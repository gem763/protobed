Add Interest\n\nShe talks about everything in detail, including Katy Perry, her feud with Scooter Braun, what really happened with Kanye West, politics and even her personal life.\n\nAsked if she'll start writing songs about things other than her personal life now that it seems less dramatic, Swift tells Rolling Stone, \"I don\u2019t feel like that yet. I think I might feel like that possibly when I have a family. If I have a family.\"\n\n\u201cI felt like I was going insane when I was trying to maintain my career in the same way that I ascended. It\u2019s easier to get power than to keep it.\" @taylorswift13 talks about identifying with #GameofThrones' Daenerys and more in our new cover story https://t.co/1U67Fuan1c pic.twitter.com/3es74gBuDZ \u2014 Rolling Stone (@RollingStone) September 18, 2019\n\n\"I don\u2019t know why I said that! But that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard from other artists ... But again, I don\u2019t know why I said that. Because I don\u2019t know how my life is going to go or what I\u2019m going to do,\" she said.\n\nRegarding her very public feud with Braun over her past masters he bought from Scott Borchetta, she's still salty about the purchase.\n\nShe revealed to \"GMA\" earlier this summer that she plans to re-record her old albums so that she has ownership of them.\n\n\"These are two very rich, very powerful men, using $300 million of other people\u2019s money to purchase, like, the most feminine body of work. And then they\u2019re standing in a wood panel bar doing a tacky photo shoot, raising a glass of scotch to themselves,\" she said.\n\nTaylor also speaks about the infamous West phone call leaked on social media by his wife, Kim Kardashian West. For awhile, Swift says, she and Kanye were getting along well.\n\nAfter a dust-up for which he apologized after, West gave her a heads up about the \"I feel like Taylor and I might still have sex\" line in \"Famous,\" which she appreciated.\n\nBut she says, \"I was like, 'OK, good. We\u2019re back on good terms.' And then when I heard the song\" -- in which he called her a 'b----' ... I was like, \u201cI\u2019m done with this. If you want to be on bad terms, let\u2019s be on bad terms, but just be real about it,\" she added.", "description": "If the interviews Taylor Swift has done so far to promote her new album", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/taylor-swift-01-gty-jt-190918_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
