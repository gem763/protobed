Rosenthal and Eisenberg found that RNA editing is especially rife in the neurons of cephalopods. They use it to re-code genes that are important for their nervous systems\u2014the genes that, as Rosenthal says, \u201cmake a nerve cell a nerve cell.\u201d And only the intelligent coleoid cephalopods\u2014octopuses, squid, and cuttlefish\u2014do so. The relatively dumber nautiluses do not. \u201cHumans don\u2019t have this. Monkeys don\u2019t. Nothing has this except the coleoids,\u201d says Rosenthal.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to say if their prolific use of RNA editing is responsible for their alien intellect, but \u201cthat would definitely be my guess,\u201d says Noa Liscovitch-Brauer, a member of Rosenthal\u2019s team who spearheaded the new study. \u201cIt makes for a very compelling hypothesis in my eyes.\u201d\n\nChambered nautilus.

For those instructions to be used, the DNA must first be transcribed into a similar molecule called RNA, which contains roughly the same building blocks. The RNA is then translated and used to build proteins\u2014the molecular machines that carry out all the important jobs inside our cells. So DNA stores information, RNA carries it, and proteins are the result of it.\n\nThat\u2019s the simple version. But the RNA often gets altered before it\u2019s used to make proteins. Some of the changes are big\u2014large sections are cut out, and the remaining pieces are glued back together. Other changes are small\u2014sometimes, a single A gets converted into an I (which is functionally equivalent to a G). That\u2019s RNA editing. It\u2019s performed by a group of enzymes called ADARs, which recognize specific sequences of RNA and makes those A-to-I changes.\n\nBut to what end? RNA editing is still mysterious, and its purpose unclear. Technically, an animal could use it to change the nature of its proteins without altering the underlying DNA instructions. But in practice, this kind of recoding is extremely rare. Only about 3 percent of human genes are ever edited in this way, and the changes are usually restricted to the parts of RNA that are cut out and discarded. To the extent that it happens, it doesn\u2019t seem to be adaptive.\n\nIn cephalopods, it\u2019s a different story. Back in 2015, Rosenthal and Eisenberg discovered that RNA editing has gone wild in the longfin inshore squid\u2014a foot-long animal that\u2019s commonly used in neuroscience research. While a typical mammal edits its RNA at just a few hundred sites, the squid was making some 57,000 such edits. These changes weren\u2019t happening in discarded sections of RNA, but in the ones that actually go towards building proteins\u2014the so-called coding regions. They were ten times more common in the squid\u2019s neurons than in its other tissues, and they disproportionately affected proteins involved in its nervous system.", "description": "It might be connected to their extraordinary intelligence.", "authors": ["Ed Yong"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2017/04/RTR33A4Y/facebook.jpg?1522777908", "published_at": "2017-04-06"}
