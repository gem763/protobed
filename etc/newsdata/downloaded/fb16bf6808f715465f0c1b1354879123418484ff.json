Don\u2019t play the martyr,\u201d the MEP wrote.\n\nLast year the European parliament triggered the EU\u2019s most serious disciplinary procedure against Hungary. The charge sheet, which includes erosion of press freedoms and weakening of judicial independence, was laid out in a report by the European parliament, partly based on findings of independent observers, such as the Council of Europe and the UN.\n\n\u201cThe threats to the rule of law and fundamental rights in Hungary concern us all,\u201d France\u2019s European affairs minister, Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin, told her fellow ministers.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of France and Germany, De Montchalin described the general picture in the parliament\u2019s report as worrying and said it was Hungary\u2019s responsibility to demonstrate that the issues raised had been closed.\n\nEarlier that day, the Hungarian government\u2019s chief spokesman, Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs, claimed the parliament\u2019s report \u201cregurgitates a laundry list of all the criticisms that Europe\u2019s liberals have thrown at the Orb\u00e1n government since 2010\u201d, the year Orb\u00e1n became prime minister for a second term.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same left-liberal forces that now want to take revenge on Hungary for standing up against the influx of immigrants and insisting that Europe\u2019s Schengen border be secured,\u201d he added.\n\nUnder EU law, the process could lead to Hungary being stripped of its voting rights, but that outcome is almost unthinkable, because of a pact with Poland. Any move to strip Hungary of voting rights could be blocked by its ally, which is subject to the same procedure and counts on Budapest\u2019s protection.\n\nBoth countries stand a greater risk of losing EU funds, as more member states balk at funding governments accused of corruption and seen as bending the EU\u2019s basic democratic values.\n\nIn a paper presented to ministers on Monday, Germany \u2013 the largest contributor to the EU budget \u2013 reaffirmed there should be a link between EU funds and rule of law.\n\nEU diplomats say the current rule of law process against Hungary is valuable despite the uncertain result. \u201cThis is of course, not a witch-hunt, this is not against anyone. We are just following the procedures written, enshrined in our treaties,\u201d said Tytti Tuppurainen, Finland\u2019s EU affairs minister and chair of the meeting.\n\nShe added that the council had not made any assessment on Monday, but would remain \u201cseized of the matter\u201d.\n\nNo British minister was planning to attend, in line with Boris Johnson\u2019s policy of skipping most EU meetings unless the UK is deemed to have \u201ca significant national interest in the outcome\u201d.", "description": "Judit Varga called to to account for erosion of press freedom and judicial independence", "authors": ["Jennifer Rankin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88a49b2938fa77bfcf13c192b539119b3dfdc106/0_322_3756_2255/master/3756.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a8610a8beb214e3f42181d8656bc5241", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
