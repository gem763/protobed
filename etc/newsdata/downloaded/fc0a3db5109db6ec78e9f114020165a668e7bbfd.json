Job totals were unchanged at 69 percent of companies, up from 57 percent in July. A broad measure of job gains in the survey fell to its lowest level since October 2012.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe hiring slowdown comes as more businesses are reporting slower growth of sales and profits.\n\nBusiness economists also expect the economy's growth to slow in the coming year, partly because tariffs have raised prices and cut into sales for many firms.\n\nPerhaps because of concerns over a weakening economy, businesses are less likely to offer higher pay, even with unemployment at a 50-year low. Just one-third of economists said their firms had lifted pay in the past three months, down from more than half a year ago.\n\nCompanies are also cutting back on their investments in machinery, computers, and other equipment. The proportion of firms increasing their spending on such goods is at its lowest level in five years, the survey found.\n\nWHERE ARE ALL THE JOBS? THESE SECTORS HIRED THE MOST IN SEPTEMBER\n\nSales are also growing more slowly. Just 39 percent of economists said they rose in the past three months, down from 61 percent a year earlier. And only 38 percent said they expect sales to rise in the next three months, also down from 61 percent a year ago.\n\nMany business economists blamed President Trump's tariffs on steel, aluminum, and on most imports from China for worsening business conditions. Thirty-five percent said the duties have hurt their companies, while just 7 percent said they had a positive effect.\n\nOf those who said tariffs had impacted their companies, 19 percent said they had lowered their sales and 30 percent said the duties pushed up costs.\n\nThe U.S. economy likely added 90 thousand new nonfarm jobs this month according to economists surveyed by Refinitiv, down 46 thousand from September\u2019s tally of 136 thousand jobs. It would mark the slowest growth since the addition of 62 thousand payrolls in May, and would be well below the average monthly gain of 161 thousand this year.\n\nTwo-thirds of the economists surveyed now forecast that the economy will grow just 1.1 percent to 2 percent from the third quarter of 2019 through the third quarter of 2020.\n\nA year ago, they were more bullish: Nearly three-quarters forecast growth of 2.1 percent to 3 percent from the third quarter of 2018 through the third quarter of 2019.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe NABE surveyed 101 economists at companies and trade associations from Sept. 26 through Oct. 14.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this article.", "description": "The October jobs report will be released on Friday.", "authors": ["Ken Martin"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/07/0/0/Desk-Workers.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
