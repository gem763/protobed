Charter as well as the basic norms governing international relations, and solve problems through political and diplomatic means under the framework of international law.\u201d\n\nHe continued:\n\nSyria\u2019s sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity should be earnestly respected and safeguarded. We call on Turkey to stop its military actions and come back to the right course of political settlement. Considering the severe situation for counterterrorism in Syria at the moment, relevant military actions may lead to the outbound escape of terrorists and the resurgence of the Islamic States. We urge Turkey to take up due responsibilities and combat terrorism with the rest of the international community.\n\nChina is one of many countries to condemn the offensive, with leaders from the United Kingdom, the European Union, Saudi Arabia, and Russia, as well as Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in Syria, also expressing their opposition. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on Turkish ministries and senior government officials after pulling U.S. troops out the region, which many considered tacit permission for the Turkish military to invade.\n\nRelations between China and Turkey have been strained over the past year after the Turkish government released a statement condemning Beijing for its imprisonment of millions of Uyghur Muslims, a Turkic ethnic group, in communist concentration camps. Outraged by the criticism, Chinese authorities responded by issuing a warning to its citizens traveling to Turkey, urging them to \u201cbe wary and pay attention to their personal safety.\u201d\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan appeared to track back on his government\u2019s criticisms during a visit to China in July, having previously denounced the policy as \u201cgenocide\u201d against the Uyghurs a decade ago. In a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Erdogan reportedly stated that \u201cit is a fact that the residents of various ethnic groups in Northwest China\u2019s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are living happily under China\u2019s development and prosperity.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "China\u2019s Foreign Ministry called on Turkey on Tuesday to halt their ongoing military offensive against Kurdish militias.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/turkish-army-tanks-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
