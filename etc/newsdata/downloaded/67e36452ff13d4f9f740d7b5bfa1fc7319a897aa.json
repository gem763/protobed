But that does have one downside: storing everything on your hard drive.\n\nThere\u2019s no information yet on how big the console download will be but the listing on Battle.net has the PC version down as a staggering 175GB.\n\nAs far as we know that breaks the record for the biggest PC install ever, ahead of the listing of 150GB for the recently announced Red Dead Redemption II and the 148GB of Final Fantasy XV.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with a game having a large install, assuming the developer isn\u2019t wasting space, as high-resolution textures and assets inevitably require more storage.\n\nBut it does create a problem with the increasing popularity of SSDs, which are more expensive than traditional hard drives and so in the next generation may leave many with less space than they\u2019re used to, especially as Sony has not yet said how big the SSD in the PlayStation 5 will be.\n\nMinimum Requirements\n\nOperating System\n\nWindows 7 64-bit (SP1) or Windows 10 64-bit\n\nProcessor\n\nIntel Core i3-4340 or AMD FX-6300\n\nVideo\n\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 670 / NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 or AMD Radeon HD 7950 \u2013 DirectX 12.0 compatible system\n\nMemory\n\n8 GB RAM\n\nStorage\n\n175 GB available hard drive space\n\nRecommended Specifications\n\nOperating System\n\nWindows 10 64-bit latest update\n\nProcessor\n\nIntel Core i5-2500K or AMD Ryzen R5 1600X Processor\n\nVideo\n\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 970/NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 or AMD Radeon R9 390 / AMD Radeon RX 580 \u2013 DirectX 12.0 compatible system\n\nMemory\n\n12 GB RAM\n\nStorage\n\n175 GB available hard drive space\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter", "description": "You might need to clear out your hard drive if you want to play this year\u2019s COD, as the minimum and recommended specs are revealed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MW_Reveal_06_wm-f526_1570708418.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
