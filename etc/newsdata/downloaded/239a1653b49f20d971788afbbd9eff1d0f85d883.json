Actually, the kids take that, knowing they have the kit, because now you're safe,\" Luan told reporters.\n\n\"They want to push it to their limit, how far they can go to overdose, because they're safe, because the kit is there,\" he said. \"Lots of times we're trying to make it easier, wanting to help, but it's a fine line. If you cross that line, you become an enabler.\"\n\nLuan, who is a member of the governing United Conservative Party, made the comments after meeting with Albertans directly affected by addictions in Calgary on Friday for a roundtable discussion. The event was held ahead of, and to mark, International Overdose Awareness Day on Saturday.\n\nNDP questions competence\n\nThe comments prompted backlash from the Alberta Opposition, the NDP.\n\nHeather Sweet, the provincial NDP's mental health and addiction critic, called on Premier Jason Kenney to remove Luan from his portfolio at a press conference in Edmonton Saturday afternoon.\n\n\"There is a clear bias by this associate minister,\" she said. \"The premier needs to fire him and needs to hire someone who's actually willing to work with Albertans and talk about addictions and mental health in a productive and solution-focused way.\"\n\nSweet said it's not the first time Luan has spoken callously about addiction, pointing to a controversial comment made earlier this summer. He deleted a tweet in which he wondered if research supporting supervised consumption sites was funded by big pharma. Through a spokesperson, Luan said he was misunderstood.\n\nNaloxone can reverse the effects of a fentanyl overdose. (Stefan Labbe/CBC)\n\nPetra Schulz co-founded Moms Stop the Harm, a national network of people whose loved ones died from drug-related harms. Her son Danny died from an accidental fentanyl overdose at 25-years-old, leading her to advocate for harm reduction strategies.\n\nSchulz said she was gravely concerned by the associate minister's comments and worried they would cast doubt over the life-saving power of naloxone.\n\n\"He basically stigmatizes a proven public health intervention that has saved thousands of lives in this province,\" Schulz said at an Overdose Awareness Day event in Edmonton.\n\nThe latest statistics show Alberta Health Services has given out 146,892 naloxone kits for free across the province since 2016. People have self-reported 9,386 overdose reversals using the kits over the same period.\n\n\"Comments like that make people hesitant, and that can cost lives and that upsets me so much,\" Schulz added.\n\nMinister repeated families, party says\n\nWhen contacted, a spokesperson for the premier's office said \"a simple review\" of Luan's comments show he was stating what he had heard from families during the roundtable.\n\n\"It's disappointing, but not surprising, that the NDP is working to misrepresent the minister's words while ignoring what some families have said,\" spokesperson Harrison Fleming said in an email.\n\nLuan's chief of staff, Marshall Smith, declined to comment on the NDP's request. He previously called CBC to note that two parents at the event believed their children had done this, and had told Luan this.\n\nSmith said the provincial government remains committed to naxolone \"100 per cent\" and will continue to fully fund its distribution.\n\nThe roundtable was the first time Luan had heard about naloxone being used \"in the wrong way,\" he told reporters after the event. He said it affected his thinking about the overdose-reversing agent.\n\n\"For me as a policy-maker, as a minister, my thinking is, 'Wow, this is interesting,'\" Luan said. \"We've got to find the balance. We can't just be one way of thinking, believing we are doing something good, when in fact that can be utilized in the wrong way.\"\n\nER physician disagrees\n\nBut Dr. Eddy Lang, an ER physician and head of emergency medicine at the University of Calgary's medical school, said he hasn't seen evidence that naloxone is being misused in the way Luan describes.\n\n\"I wouldn't agree necessarily with the idea that giving naloxone enables someone to pursue their addiction,\" Lang said.\n\n\"While that's a possibility and maybe that does occur, it's a really small proportion \u2014 a drop in the bucket of how naloxone is being used in the community,\" he said.\n\nDr. Eddy Lang, an emergency-room physician in Calgary, said he has never gotten the sense patients are using opioids with naloxone on standby so they can push their limits. (Submitted by Dr. Eddy Lang)\n\nHe said naloxone is a \"life-saving opportunity.\"\n\n\"I've never gotten the sense from the patients coming to the emergency department that they had the naloxone at the ready, trying to push the limits on what they were using.\"\n\n'Catastrophic' if naloxone not available\n\nLang said naloxone routinely saves lives and needs to be readily available. If distribution is limited, \"the results would be catastrophic,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think that we're enabling or contributing to the problem by offering a life-saving intervention that can be used in a moment of crisis.\"\n\nIn emergency rooms, Lang said doctors are training overdose patients to use naloxone and sending them home with the overdose-reversing drug.\n\nLuan told reporters naloxone is just one tool of many needed to combat the opioid crisis.", "description": "Alberta's associate minister of mental health is facing a call for removal from his job after comments he made about an opioid antidote.
