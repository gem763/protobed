However, low and zero-emission vehicles still only make up a fraction of the market underscoring the huge challenge of fast-tracking a shift to zero-emission transport.\n\n'Ambition must be matched by measures that support industry allowing manufacturers time to invest, innovate and sell competitively.\n\n'This includes long-term government commitment to incentives and investment in infrastructure to accelerate the uptake of these new technologies.'\n\nWhen do other nations intend to ban petrol and diesel vehicles? China - TBC Costa Rica - 2050 Denmark - 2030 France - 2040 Iceland - 2030 Ireland - 2030 Israel - 2030 (only imported vehicles) Netherlands - 2030 Norway - 2025 Scotland - 2032 Sri Lanka - 2040 (all vehicles, not just new models being sold) Sweden - 2030\n\nCommitment to incentives is certainly something Mr Shapps has failed to provide during his short tenure as transport secretary.\n\nJust last month he said in an interview that the Plug-in Car Grant - which subsidises the price of a new electric car by up to \u00a33,500 - will 'go eventually' as the government explores terminating the incentive.\n\nHis comment was made just weeks after he himself had benefited from the grant, using it to help with the purchase of his new Tesla Model 3 electric vehicle.\n\nWhile the grant looks set to be scrapped, the government has at least looked to boost the infrastructure for plug-in cars.\n\nIt said last month that it will invest a total of \u00a3400million to help bolster the public charging network, with \u00a370million used to fund the installation of 3,000 rapid chargers over the next five years.\n\nThe British government is under immense pressure to introduce measures to help it reach a legally-binding requirement to be carbon neutral by 2050 along with a number of other air pollution targets before then.\n\nCar makers also have scaling CO2 targets for their vehicles ranges set by the European Union as the sector looks to shift to electric and other renewable power sources.\n\nEnvironmentalists have previously stated that Britain's 2040 ban is unambitious and pointed to other European nations which are imposing the deadline much earlier, such as Norway which has the intention to cull fossil-fuelled vehicles by 2025.", "description": "Transport secretary Grant Shapps told the Conservative Party conference that\u00a0the Government will 'look again' at the current 2040 deadline and 'explore the case' for accelerating it.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
