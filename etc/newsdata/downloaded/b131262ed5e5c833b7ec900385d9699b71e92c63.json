Rolling out now! @WarrenBuffett!\u201d\n\nUnspoken ironies\n\nAs CashApp\u2019s Twitter handle indicated the same day, app users will soon be able to own a piece of hundreds of different stocks \u2014 rather than an entire share.\n\nThis, as Dorsey tweeted, includes the most expensive stock on the market \u2014 Berkshire Hathaway Class A \u2014 which regularly trades above $300,000 per share.\n\nThe irony of Square \u2014 which saw its own stock jump $1 billion within 5 days when it first announced its BTC trading option back in 2017 \u2014 promoting its new investing product with the example of Berkshire Hathaway shares will not go unnoticed in the crypto community.\n\nBerkshire CEO\u2019s billionaire chairman Warren Buffett is notorious for his by-now ritual opprobrium toward Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\n#Stacksats\n\nIn addition to share fractions, Dorsey also reiterated that users, who aren\u2019t into stocks, can buy fractions of Bitcoin (BTC) using the same interface.\n\nHe used the hashtag #Stacksats to refer to one Satoshi; the name (after Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakomoto) given to the smallest, indivisible unit of the cryptocurrency \u2014 one hundred millionth of one Bitcoin.\n\nEarlier this year, during an earnings call devoted to Square\u2019s Q2 2019 results, Dorsey recognized the eye-popping impact that introducing Bitcoin support had on the company\u2019s Cash App revenue.\n\nAt the time, Square\u2019s latest shareholder letter had revealed that Cash App had raised $135 million in subscription, services and transaction-based revenue \u2014 and that separately, Bitcoin revenue alone accounted for $125 million.\n\n\u201cWe love you Bitcoin,\u201d Dorsey said.\n\nIn his own annual shareholders\u2019 meeting back in 2018, Warren Buffett, for his part, memorably characterized Bitcoin as being \"probably rat poison squared.\"", "description": "Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and Square, announced that Square\u2019s Cash App is poised to enable users to purchase fractions of stocks alongside Bitcoin", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNWVlYmVkY2RlMGU1YzhkZDBjYjMyNzIyMGM3MTdlM2QuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
