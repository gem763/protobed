Gen. David Thompson, vice commander of the US Air Force Space Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that \"they are tracking about 270 different objects in the debris field,\" according to Spaceflight Now.\n\n\"Likely, that number is going to grow as the debris field spreads out and we collect more sensor information,\" he said.\n\nA software-engineering company called Analytical Graphics Inc. (AGI) has now created its own simulation of the debris created by the anti-satellite test. The company \u2014 which \"visualizes objects in space and time with unprecedented accuracy,\" according to its website \u2014 posted the video (embedded below) to YouTube on Thursday.\n\nThe simulation uses what the company calls \"standard breakup models\" to approximately illustrate the clouds of debris particles that resulted from the test.\n\n\"We modeled 6,500 fragments, basically those that were larger than half a centimeter,\" Tom Johnson, the vice president of engineering for Analytical Graphics Inc., said.\n\nThe remnants of 'Mission Shakti'\n\nModi announced the test, called \"Mission Shakti,\" during a live broadcast on Wednesday morning. The test destroyed a satellite called Microsat-R that weighed about 1,600 pounds.\n\n\"Until now, only US, Russia, and China could claim the title. India is the fourth country to achieve this feat,\" he said during the broadcast.\n\nAny collision in space creates a cloud of debris, and incredible energies are involved in anti-satellite events. A head-on collision can contain the energy of a car hitting another car at more than 22,000 mph \u2014 more than a dozen times as fast as a bullet shot from a gun.\n\nThis can hurl countless fast-moving pieces into space; traveling at such velocities, even a stray paint chip can disable a satellite.\n\nRead more: The US government logged 308,984 potential space-junk collisions in 2017 \u2014 and the problem could get much worse\n\nFortunately, Microsat-R was destroyed at a relatively low altitude of about 175 miles. The closer a spacecraft is to Earth when it's destroyed, the quicker its debris will fall back and burn up.\n\nThe satellite was lower than the International Space Station's orbit of 250 miles, as well as that of a weather satellite that China destroyed in 2007. (Debris from the Chinese test still orbits the planet today.) However, this test was about 40 miles higher than the altitude at which the US destroyed one of its satellites in 2008.\n\nRight now, radar and other systems can track debris about the size of a golf ball or larger. Much smaller objects are difficult to track but still pose a threat to spacecraft.\n\nThe US Strategic Command's Joint Force Space Component Command is \"actively tracking and monitoring the situation,\" a spokesperson told Business Insider on Wednesday.\n\nWhat the debris simulation of the 'Mission Shakti' test shows\n\nPart of the animation, which we learned about from Michael Sheetz of CNBC, is shown above. It shows the anti-satellite missile's \"kill vehicle\" \u2014 what is essentially a giant bullet slug \u2014 and its path in red. Microsat-R and its orbit are shown in green.\n\n\"The Microsat-R satellite was launched on January 24, 2019, with a mass of 740 kilograms [1,630 pounds]. It's a fairly large satellite,\" Johnson said.\n\nHe added that the simulation makes conservative assumptions, such as a downward collision \"to minimize the debris fragments.\" The calculations assume that the collision happened at a height of 175 miles (Microsat-R's last known altitude), and that the missile and satellite collided at a \"closing velocity\" of about 22,000 mph.\n\nAlthough the model estimates the number of tiny debris pieces to be over 6,000, Johnson said that \"in reality, we can't track the objects that small, so the number of trackable objects is gonna be significantly less.\"\n\nA narrator of the video said AGI is waiting for US Strategic Command to release information about the 270 objects being tracked.\n\n\"We look forward to the release of that information so that we can update our debris model and the rest of our analysis,\" the narrator said. \"Stay tuned.\"\n\nFor now, based on the simulation, the test appears to have kicked some debris to higher orbits around Earth (as shown below).\n\nBusiness Insider asked multiple spokespeople from NASA and the Department of Defense if any debris is known to pose a threat to spacecraft but did not get a response.\n\n\"We immediately started providing public notice on our Space Track website and will provide direct notification to spacecraft operators if those satellites are under threat,\" Thompson told the Senate on Wednesday. \"I will also say, at this point in time, the International Space Station is not at risk.\"\n\nYou can watch AGI's full animation below.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "description": "A new video by Analytical Graphics shows a simulation of India's anti-satellite missile creating clouds of high-speed space junk around Earth.", "authors": ["Dave Mosher"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c9e8455c6cc503a294129e3-1136-568.jpg"}
