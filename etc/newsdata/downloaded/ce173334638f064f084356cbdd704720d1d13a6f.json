But Finland exports millions of pounds of fur to here each year.\n\n(Image: Humane Society International/Oikeutta Elaimille)\n\n(Image: Humane Society International/Oikeutta Elaimille)\n\nHumane Society International/UK, which discovered the harrowing scenes of animal misery at 13 farms in the Nordic country, wants fur sales stopped. The charity\u2019s Claire Bass said: \u201cAll of this suffering to provide a frivolous product the fashion industry does not need. The UK imports millions of pounds of fur from Finland with many unsuspecting British consumers buying from farms like the ones we visited.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tragic to think that fur from the baby foxes we saw on these farms could one day end up on a UK shop shelf.\n\n\u201cWe saw a few hundred of the millions of foxes and mink in miles of battery cages. These poor young animals exist only as vessels for their fur, as broken and tormented souls.\n\n\u201cDespite what the fur trade tries to portray on catwalks, there is nothing glamorous about fur. As long as the UK allows British businesses to trade in fur, we are complicit in the cruelty.\n\n(Image: Humane Society International/Oikeutta Elaimille)\n\n\u201cBritain was the first country in the world to ban fur farming, now it\u2019s time for us to finish the job and become the first country in the world to ban sales too.\u201d\n\nTowie TV star Pete Wicks, who joined the charity on the investigation, added: \u201cIt was \u00adsickening, I don\u2019t believe anyone who has seen the state of these poor animals, terrified and trapped in tiny cages, would ever wear fur again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great the UK banned fur farming, but it doesn\u2019t make sense that we\u2019re still selling fur from farms like these.\u201d\n\n(Image: Humane Society International/Oikeutta Elaimille)\n\nSince 2003, almost \u00a3700million of fur has been imported into the UK, including \u00a314million from Finland. Most comes from China, the US, France, Italy and Poland. Last year the UK bought almost \u00a375million of fur.\n\nProducts can be found on the high street from some of the most expensive luxury brands to market stalls. Fur from Asia mislabelled as synthetic is also finding its way into the supply chain.\n\nRetailers including Amazon and TK Maxx were last year found to be unwittingly selling clothes and bags labelled \u201cfaux fur\u201d made from rabbit, fox and raccoon dog. They removed them from sale when the problem was discovered.\n\nIt is \u00adestimated 100 million animals are trapped in tiny cages on fur farms, worldwide.\n\nMink are killed by gassing, while foxes and raccoon dogs die by electrocution.", "description": "Anti-fur campaigners have visited 13 farms in Finland that supply the UK market to discover harrowing scenes of animals suffering in poor living conditions", "authors": ["Nada Farhoud", "Image", "Humane Society International Oikeutta Elaimille"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20636517.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Finland-Fur-Farm-Investigation.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
