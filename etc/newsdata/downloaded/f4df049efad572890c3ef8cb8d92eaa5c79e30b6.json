House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer don\u2019t seem to think so, calling his agreement to pause Turkey\u2019s military campaign in northeastern Syria a \u201csham.\"\n\nThe US-Turkey agreement to pause Ankara\u2019s operation \u201cseriously undermines the credibility of America\u2019s foreign policy and sends a dangerous message to our allies and adversaries alike that our word cannot be trusted,\u201d Pelosi and Schumer said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nPresident Erdogan has given up nothing, and President Trump has given him everything.\n\nJust last week, however, the pair were tearing their hair out over what they were certain was the impending genocide of the Kurds at Turkey\u2019s hands. Pelosi called President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull troops out of northern Syria in order to clear the way for the Turkish anti-terror operation \u201ca foolish attempt to appease an authoritarian strongman,\u201d while Schumer insisted Trump was \u201cputting America in danger.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Westerners who propped up Islamist \u2018moderate rebels\u2019 suddenly realize they're terrorists as they launch \u2018genocide\u2019 of Kurds\n\nWith Trump having \u201crescued\u201d the Kurds from the doom predicted by his opponents \u2013 though Ankara has insisted all along that their quarrel is not with the Kurds, but with the PKK, a Kurdish militia group designated terrorists by Turkey, and its alleged offshoot in Syria \u2013 the top Democrats have rushed to condemn the deal he made, though it\u2019s hard to see how anyone loses under the agreement.\n\nThe 120-hour ceasefire agreed upon by Turkey on Thursday allows the Kurdish militias who previously fought alongside the US to retreat at least 32km from the border. Turkey seeks to turn the cleared area into a \u201csafe zone\u201d and has promised to end its military campaign upon the withdrawal of Kurdish troops. The US said it would not impose any more sanctions, and once the ceasefire is made permanent, all existing sanctions drawn up in the last week will be canceled.\n\nAlso on rt.com House condemns Trump\u2019s pullout of US troops they never bothered to authorize to be in Syria at all\n\nThe Democratic leaders quarreled with Trump earlier this week, during a meeting about the situation in Syria that saw Pelosi storm out of the room, suggesting their seemingly nonsensical condemnation of Trump\u2019s latest move after getting what they wanted is motivated primarily by spite. In the meantime, the House of Representatives had voted overwhelmingly to condemn Trump for the troop pullout, perhaps forgetting they\u2019d never authorized a US military deployment to Syria in the first place.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
