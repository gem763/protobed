Yahoo! is partnering with The Action Network during the football season to bring you expert sports betting information and analysis.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins closed as 18-point home underdogs against the New England Patriots in Week 2, and promptly lost 43-0.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWith the Fins now heading to Dallas to take on the 2-0 Cowboys, we knew this line would be a doozy, and oddsmakers did not disappoint. At the time of writing, the Cowboys are 21-point favorites in this Week 3 matchup.\n\nAccording to our Bet Labs software, which offers the ability to analyze archived NFL odds and betting data since the start of the 2003 season, Dallas is on pace to become just the fourth team over that span to close as a favorite of at least three touchdowns.\n\nThe last team to accomplish that feat was the Denver Broncos, who closed as 27-point favorites against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Oct. 13, 2013.\n\nThe New England Patriots also reached the three-touchdown mark twice in 2007, closing at -24 against the Philadelphia Eagles and -22 against the Dolphins during that campaign.\n\nInterestingly, all three of these teams failed to cover the spread in those matchups, although the sample size is too small for drawing meaningful betting conclusions.\n\nAs of early Monday afternoon, NFL bettors are having no problems laying this massive number. The Cowboys have attracted 85 percent of bets and 80 percent of dollars wagered on Sunday\u2019s game against the Dolphins.\n\nBe sure to download The Action Network\u2019s free mobile app to track live odds and betting percentage updates for Dolphins vs. Cowboys, as well as every NFL Week 3 matchup.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Only three times before has a team gone off as a 3-plus touchdown favorite.
