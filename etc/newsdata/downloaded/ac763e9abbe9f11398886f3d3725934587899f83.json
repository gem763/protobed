The child is slapped on her buttocks. In another video, a toddler is slapped for what appears to be a refusal to sleep, News24 reported.\n\nBoth accused have been released on R3 000 bail. Edwards is expected back at the court on August 30, while Sinwametsi's case has been escalated to the regional court.\n\n\"Sinwametsi's case has been moved upon request by the SPP (Senior Public Prosecutor) to the regional court in accordance with section 175 of the CPA, and she will appear again on 29 August,\" Women & Men Against Child Abuse said in a statement on Friday.\n\nWMACA have reiterated its call for police to arrest the videographer as well.\n\n\"Although we are satisfied that the cr\u00e8che owner has finally been arrested and will be appearing in court, we maintain that there were three perpetrators in accordance with Section 110 of the Children's Amendment Act (which makes provision for the compelled immediate reporting of child abuse) and as such we hope that the videographer will also have been arrested by the time we return to court,\" the organisation says in a statement.\n\n\"The silent protest by mothers and the community alike outside the Oberholzer Magistrate's Court has demonstrated the serious light in which this terrible violation of toddlers at the hands of the people tasked to protect them should be viewed.\"\n\nThe cr\u00e8che was shut down in April after it was found to be operating with an expired licence.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
