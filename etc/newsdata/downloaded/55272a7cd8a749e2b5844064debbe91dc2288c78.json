When they told him to come outside and he was guessing he was going to see his friends,\" she said. \"And they did what they did to him after they called his phone.\" \"Evidently whoever did it, he knew who it was because when I went to see him at the morgue, he had a shocked look on his face,\" Tracie said. Davantae was going to be a freshman at Marshall High School.

Stopping violent criminals\u2014prosecuting & getting them off the street\u2014BEFORE they commit more violent crimes is the most effective way to reduce murder rates. Let\u2019s protect our citizens.\"\n\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot took issue with Cruz's assessment, telling him to \"Keep our name out of your mouth.\"\n\n\"60% of illegal firearms recovered in Chicago come from outside IL\u2014mostly from states dominated by coward Republicans like you who refuse to enact commonsense gun legislation,\" she said.", "description": ".09/03/2019 19:37:21PM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/townhall/reu/o/2018/324/ebe66d49-8616-46d0-9da2-320bf6f5206a.png"}
