The man who once took on Nixon, somehow found himself sitting in the same chair that\u2019s been home to real housewives of all different ilks.\n\nBut as it turns out, Rather was up to the challenge. After delivering the kind of newsy advice one might expect from the veteran anchor\u2014you know, things like don\u2019t binge eat because of Trump\u2014Rather entered the realm of reality television. When Cohen asked the 87-year-old if he had any advice for newly single Kylie Jenner, Rather had this to say: \u201cWith great respect, I would say get a dog. If you already have a dog, get another dog.\"\n\nSo there you have it. The cure to a broken heart is apparently a puppy, at least according to Dan Rather. But who\u2019s to say Kylie\u2019s heart is indeed broken? After all, the makeup mogul recently said that she and Travis Scott are on \u201cgood terms,\u201d and that their daughter, Stormi Webster, is their main focus. Other sources have said that the duo simply reached an impasse\u2014that their love had faded after the honeymoon phase ended and the harsh realities of \u201cnormal life\u201d set in.\n\nThat\u2019s a far cry from the united front they projected in the most recent issue of Playboy, where Jenner spoke about all things chemistry-related.\n\n\"We think the same and we have the same goals and passions in life,\" Jenner told Scott in the issue. \"Besides the fact that we have good chemistry, we have a lot of fun together. You\u2019re my best friend. Through all the ups and downs that every relationship has, we evolve together through them and keep getting stronger.\"\n\nAnd suddenly we\u2019re the ones who need a puppy.\n\nRelated: Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott Posed for Playboy\n\nOriginally Appeared on W\n\n", "description": "Words we never thought we'd say.", "authors": ["Dan Barna"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YLval7UbwmqHSZgYAJO1vA--~B/aD0zNjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/w_988/7ccbfb3ce7f959e2eabce85989de1316", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
