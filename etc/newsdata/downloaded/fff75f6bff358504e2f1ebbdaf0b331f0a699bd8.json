Monsanto says the science overwhelmingly supports its view that there is no link. The controversy raises the question \u2014 are chemical herbicides necessary to maintain a home garden? (iStock)\n\nColumnist\n\nUnless you have been living on Mars, you have probably seen the TV ads from law firms seeking cancer patients who have used the ubiquitous herbicide brand Roundup.\n\nThree recent high-profile cases in California have brought verdicts against Roundup\u2019s maker, Monsanto, one with a jury award of $2 billion, later reduced to $86.7 million. To date, more than 18,000 plaintiffs are suing Monsanto in state and federal courts alleging Roundup-related cancers.\n\nMonsanto insists Roundup is not carcinogenic, says it has no plans to pull it from the market and is appealing the verdicts. \u201cIt\u2019s clear these products are safe when used as directed,\u201d said Rakesh Kilaru, a Washington attorney for Monsanto.\n\nMuch of Monsanto\u2019s legal morass stems from a 2015 report from the World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer that said Roundup\u2019s active ingredient, glyphosate, was \u201cprobably carcinogenic.\u201d More recently, researchers at the University of Washington looked at available data and concluded that Roundup could increase the risk of developing non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma by 41 percent.\n\n[How America\u2019s frenzy for Japanese plants brought beauties \u2014 and a mega-weed]\n\nMonsanto says the science comes down overwhelmingly on its side. In April, the Environmental Protection Agency reaffirmed its conclusion that glyphosate is not carcinogenic as part of a comprehensive re-registration process of the herbicide. Regulatory agencies in Europe and Canada have reached their own similar determination.\n\nIn addition, the long-term Agricultural Health Study of more than 52,000 pesticide applicators, conducted by the National Cancer Institute and others, reported a link between cancers and some pesticides, but not glyphosate.\n\nRoundup has been around since 1974 and historically has been assailed on ecological grounds \u2014 that it allows farmers to eradicate the weedy wildflower that monarch butterflies need for reproduction, or that it has been a catalyst for the development of genetically modified \u201cRoundup Ready\u201d commodity crops, with their perceived ills. The vast majority of Roundup sales is to farmers, not homeowners, and it is the world\u2019s most popular herbicide. Monsanto was acquired last year by Bayer AG for $63 billion.\n\nThe new controversy about human health may give home gardeners pause. But the question for me is: Does the gardener actually need chemical herbicides? With the exception of the occasional application of crabgrass preventer, I generally don\u2019t use them, preferring to pull or hoe weeds in garden beds and live with them in the lawn. Simply, I don\u2019t want to rely on poisons \u2014 this extends to insecticides and fungicides \u2014 as a component of my gardening.\n\nThis isn\u2019t for the sake of my own health \u2014 I have faith in the EPA\u2019s science-driven regulatory system, and when I have used products, I have read the label carefully and followed the instructions diligently. My aversion to them is based on the feeling that pesticides in general aren\u2019t good for beneficial insects, birds and other animals, or for the rich soil biology that is the underpinning of any healthy garden.\n\nIf you are turning to herbicides regularly, I think there is something wrong with your approach to gardening.\n\nThere are times when herbicides are needed, or at least justified. Some weeds should stay at arm\u2019s length; poison ivy, giant hogweed and the thorny vine named tear-thumb are obvious examples. If you have a large property, say an acre or more, physical removal of weeds can be too onerous. (If you hire a landscape maintenance crew, its approach may be to use herbicides rather than hand-weed. That\u2019s part of the control you lose when others do the work.)\n\nHardy woody vines may have extensive root systems that cannot be removed without undue effort or machinery. You must cut the stem near the ground and then paint the wound with the applicable herbicide, and such candidates include porcelain berry, English ivy, trumpet creeper, and weedy honeysuckles, bittersweet and wisterias.\n\nAlso, the Mid-Atlantic must be one of the weediest places on Earth, thanks to the heat and rainfall of the growing season and the relative mildness of the winter.\n\nSo there are reasons to use herbicides. But it\u2019s important to understand that reaching for a herbicide is treating a symptom, not the disease.\n\nWeeds exist in two stages. Where they have overtaken neglected beds and lawns, you must take back the territory. This may involve the use of herbicides, though there are other, non-chemical methods.\n\nAfter you have beaten back a weed infestation, you have to stop the weeds from returning. Remove them regularly and do so before they set seed.\n\nAvoid the void\n\n\n\nThe best strategy against weeds is to deny them real estate. Garden beds that are densely planted will gives weeds little chance to germinate and grow. Perennial ground covers will fill in. (iStock)\n\nWeeds fill empty spaces and germinate in disturbed soil, as buried weed seeds find light and moisture. If you pull or spray a weed without addressing the void, weeds will return swiftly.\n\nThe most effective and sustainable remedy for weeds is to crowd them out with desirable plants. In the lawn, this is achieved by having a full, vigorous stand of turf grass. If your grass is receding and patchy, it may be because of an underlying problem such as poor drainage or too much shade. Addressing the cause before you re-seed your lawn will provide greater success for the grass and a better ability to keep future weeds at bay.\n\nIn ornamental beds, unplanted areas can be covered in mulch, but it is better (and more satisfying) to smother those areas in plants, in perennial ground covers that will fill in and exclude weeds. Figure out whether your beds are in sun or shade, and plant accordingly.\n\nOrganic mulches will suppress weeds, but they often break down into a growing medium where weeds will grow, especially when spread too thickly.\n\n[Sick of buying mulch for the garden? The pros have a different idea.]\n\nIn the vegetable garden, exposed soil is the nature of the beast. When you are growing veggies, and especially as they start out as seedlings, it\u2019s vital to keep weeds at bay by pulling them and carefully cultivating the soil regularly. When beds are not being used, they need to be covered or, better yet, sown with cover crops. This is also true in the colder months as winter annual weeds germinate in October and develop into seeding monsters in March and April.\n\nWinter rye, vetch and clovers, sown now, are green manures that will crowd out winter weeds.\n\n\n\nThe GrowTech Hori-Hori Digging Tool from Gempler's. (Gempler's)\n\nWolf-Garten's Interlocken Draw Hoe. The attachment pairs with a separate handle. (Wolf-Garten)\n\nHoes and other weeding tools\n\nThe common or garden hoe is great for breaking up and grading loose soil but not so good for weeding. Some gardeners like an oscillating or stirrup hoe to attack a weedy bed, but I prefer a hoe with a thin, razor-sharp blade for slicing quickly through weeds in tight areas \u2014 that is, close to desired plants. The Dutch hoe is such a type, designed to be thrust forward at or just below the soil surface. My choice is a hoe you draw \u2014 I use a model with interchangeable heads, using its Interlocken Draw Hoe attachment ($16.99, wolfgarten.us).\n\nJohnny\u2019s Selected Seeds sells a range of sharp-edged hoes. Various Japanese-made hoes have high-quality stainless steel blades and seem readily available online.\n\nThe weeding knife doubles as a trowel but is useful for light cultivation of soil and slicing of weeds young and old. One side has a serrated edge. The Japanese version is called hori-hori ($21.99, gemplers.com). I wouldn\u2019t be without it.\n\nFor fine weeding \u2014 around emerging lettuce seedlings, for example \u2014 I use a pocket knife that I keep sharp on a whetstone.\n\nFor tap-rooted perennial weeds such as dandelions, use a fish tail weeder to remove the entire plant.\n\nSolarization\n\nFor whole areas being cleared of established weeds, you can use a plastic sheet to trap the sun\u2019s rays and cook the weeds beneath. Solarization works only on sunny sites during the hottest months. Experts say clear plastic is more effective than black sheeting. First, soak the ground. Some solarizers like to elevate the plastic a little \u2014 bricks will work \u2014 to form an air pocket to cook the weed seeds and seedlings induced into growth by the light, heat and water. The plastic must be secure at the edges against high winds and rips promptly patched.\n\nSonja Birthisel, a postdoctoral scholar of weed ecology at the University of Maine, says that two weeks should be long enough to kill most annual weeds but that perennial weeds such as yellow nutsedge may take as long as 12 weeks. Caveats: You\u2019re using environmentally unfriendly plastic, it is not instant, and it\u2019s ugly. It can also harm soil microbes, but they will come back, Birthisel said.\n\nDon\u2019t confuse solarization with landscape or weed-blocking fabric, which is typically laid in strips, pinned to the ground and covered in mulch. Shrubs and perennials can be planted through the fabric. I am not a fan of fabric; it prevents you from planting afresh \u2014 bulbs, for example \u2014 and it invariably becomes visible and looks ugly, among other issues.\n\n\n\nFor patios, paths and driveways, flame weeders offer a satisfying method of dealing with tenacious weeds. Avoid mulched beds and be prepared for perennial weeds to return from the roots. (iStock)\n\nFlame weeders\n\nIf you have large areas of patio, paths or driveways, flame weeders are a way to deal with those pesky weeds that grow up between the cracks and defy hand pulling. Most models are commercial-grade, rely on barbecue-type propane tanks and are pricey. Horticulturist Roger Davis operates one named the Weed Dragon at Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square, Pa.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfect for gravel patios, brick paths and patios, slate pavers,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would never want to use it in a mulched ring under shrubs or trees.\u201d\n\nEstablished perennial weeds may come back after a few weeks.\n\nThese weeders may be restricted for obvious reasons in areas of the country prone to wild fires. Save the flip-flops for the beach.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t let just anyone use it,\u201d Davis said. \u201cYou have to have a bit of training here on site.\u201d\n\nOrganic herbicides\n\nVinegar- or acetic acid-based sprays will kill or damage top growth, but formulations that are concentrated enough to be effective herbicides may also be acidic enough to injure the user. They are useful on emerging weed seedlings.\n\nHerbicidal soaps are available and work by using salts to break down the cell walls of targeted plants.\n\nCorn gluten products work as a pre-emergent herbicide; they will kill only weeds beginning to germinate, not established ones. They are expensive, especially if used in quantities required for a lawn, and must be applied at the right time to be effective.\n\nThey are sold for use, too, in vegetable gardens, but then you can\u2019t re-seed treated areas for several weeks afterward.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine tying my hands in such a way in the vegetable garden. It\u2019s a place where I\u2019m constantly reworking beds, harvesting, pulling failures and re-seeding.\n\nAnd weeding.\n\n@adrian_higgins on Twitter", "description": "Pesticides in general aren\u2019t good for beneficial insects, birds and other animals, or for the rich soil biology that is the underpinning of any healthy garden.", "authors": ["Adrian Higgins", "Gardening Columnist", "Adrian Higgins Has Been Writing About Gardening", "Landscape Design", "Related Environmental Topics Since The Late He Joined The Washington Post In He Is The Author Of Several Books", "Including The", "Washington Post Garden Book", "Chanticleer", "A Pleasure Garden."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QKCREfPDClAJbbPmjq8QgWvYkhg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4RARJ5WT6YI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
