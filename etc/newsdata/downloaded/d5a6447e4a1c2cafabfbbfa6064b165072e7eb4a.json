New areas being resettled with the Kurds,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Saturday, Abdi said the US was not doing enough to force Ankara to abide by the agreement, a day after Turkish-led bombardment killed 14 civilians.\n\nHe said however that his forces had resumed working with the US-led coalition against IS in the east of the country, and insisted Washington\u2019s presence in the country was important.\n\nThe violence since October 9 has killed hundreds from both sides and displaced hundreds of thousands from their homes, the Observatory says, in the latest humanitarian crisis in Syria\u2019s eight-year civil war.\n\nThe international community has warned that the incursion could force Kurdish fighters to redeploy from jails and camps where they are guarding thousands of suspected IS fighters and family members.\n\nThey fear a resurgence of the extremists, whom the SDF expelled from their last scrap of territory in March but who continue to claim deadly attacks in Kurdish-held areas.", "description": "Ras al-Ain (Syria) (AFP) \u2013 Dozens of Kurdish fighters left a Turkish-besieged town in northern Syria Sunday, in what appeared to be the start of a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/932bfb_dozens-us-armoured-vehicles-escorted-by-helicopters-driving-northern-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
