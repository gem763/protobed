And as I was doing so, it occurred to me that there are several convergences of events that were particularly interesting.\n\nBelow are some undersold moments in this saga.\n\n1. The May 2018 offensive by Giuliani\u2019s now-indicted associates\n\nTrump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani\u2019s two business associates, Lev Parnas, a Ukrainian-born U.S. citizen, and Igor Fruman, a Belarus-born U.S. citizen, were indicted Thursday. And the timeline laid out by their indictment suggests lots of action in May 2018, including a $325,000 donation to a pro-Trump super PAC that was bookended by meetings with President Trump and Donald Trump Jr.:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMay 1, 2018: Parnas and Fruman meet Trump at the White House, according to later-deleted Facebook photos. May 9, 2018: Parnas posts a photo of him and his business partner David Correia meeting with Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Tex.) in Sessions\u2019s Capitol Hill office. That same day, Sessions writes to the State Department seeking the dismissal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. Sessions says he has \u201cnotice of concrete evidence\u201d that she had \u201cspoken privately and repeatedly about her disdain for the current Administration.\u201d The two men commit to raise $20,000 for Sessions, according to their later indictments. May 17, 2018: Parnas and Fruman contribute $325,000 to the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action through a newly formed business named Global Energy Producers LLC, which is supposedly a liquefied natural gas company. In their later indictments, prosecutors will say the funds actually came from a $1.26 million private lending transaction that occurred two days earlier. May 21, 2018: Parnas posts a picture on Facebook showing him and Fruman at breakfast with Donald Trump Jr. in Beverly Hills, Calif.\n\nThere\u2019s much we don\u2019t know about precisely what Parnas and Fruman are accused of, but their proximity to the Trumps around this time \u2014 and their meeting with Trump Jr. so shortly after their big donation \u2014 raises questions about what was discussed in those meetings. The president has said he doesn\u2019t know who the men are, which is a little tough to believe given they got meetings with both Donald Trumps in a space of three weeks.\n\nAlso intriguing: Sessions writing the letter on the same day he met with the men. He has not been accused of any wrongdoing, but we know the indictment mentions that the two men agreed to raise $20,000 for Sessions around this time.\n\nExpect there to be more key events around this period of time, which seemed to be rather busy when it came to these men\u2019s alleged attempts to corruptly influence U.S.-Ukraine policy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n2. Gordon Sondland\u2019s quid pro quo allusion\n\nWe found out this weekend that Trump\u2019s European Union ambassador, Gordon Sondland, isn\u2019t exactly going to go to bat for his boss. As The Post\u2019s Aaron C. Davis and John Hudson report, Sondland will say that his Sept. 9 text message claiming there was no quid pro quo between Trump and Ukraine was just him relaying what Trump had told him \u2014 not that he was actually vouching for its accuracy.\n\nWhat\u2019s about as telling, though, is what Sondland was saying before that Sept. 9 text message. Specifically, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) has said Sondland suggested, as of late August, that there was some kind of quid pro quo:\n\nAD\n\nLate August: Sondland tells Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) that Trump was withholding the Ukraine military aid to \u201cget to the bottom of what happened in 2016 \u2014 if President Trump has that confidence, then he\u2019ll release the military spending,\" according to Johnson\u2019s later recollection to the Wall Street Journal. Sept. 1: Taylor texts Sondland, asking, \u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d Sondland responds, \u201cCall me.\u201d Sept. 9: Taylor texts Sondland again about the idea that the military aid is being withheld in some kind of quid pro quo. \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor says. Sondland speaks with Trump via phone and responds to Taylor: \u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign I suggest we stop the back and forth by text If you still have concerns I recommend you give Lisa Kenna or S a call to discuss them directly. Thanks.\u201d\n\nExactly what Sondland told Johnson isn\u2019t clear, but we\u2019ll learn more from his deposition Thursday. And the timing suggests Sondland was quite worried, at least at some point, that there was a quid pro quo.\n\nAD\n\n3. The U.S. comments on Ukrainian corruption before Biden does\n\nThe Trump team continues to push the idea that Joe Biden did something corrupt when, as vice president, he threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if it didn\u2019t tackle corruption. They suggest he was trying to take the heat off Burisma Holdings, an energy company in Ukraine that employed his son Hunter Biden.\n\nWe already know, based on U.S. and Ukrainian officials, that the investigation of Burisma had been dormant at the time. But the timeline also shows Biden was hardly the only U.S. official making that demand. Within months of Viktor Shokin\u2019s appointment as prosecutor general in early 2015, U.S. officials were calling him soft on corruption in no uncertain terms. And two major statements came well before Biden\u2019s\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n3 ultimatum:\n\nSept. 24, 2015: The U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, blasts Shokin in a speech in Odessa, Ukraine. He points to a \u201cglaring problem\u201d that threatens the good work regional leaders are doing: \u201cthe failure of the institution of the prosecutor general of Ukraine to successfully fight internal corruption.\u201d \u201cThe United States stands behind those who challenge these bad actors,\u201d Pyatt adds. Oct. 8, 2015: Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Victoria Nuland adds in testimony that the Ukraine \u201cprosecutor general\u2019s office has to be reinvented as an institution that serves the citizens of Ukraine, rather than ripping them off.\u201d Dec. 8, 2015: In Kiev, Biden tells Ukrainian leaders to fire Shokin or lose more than $1 billion in loan guarantees. Biden joins many Western leaders in urging Shokin\u2019s ouster.\n\nIt\u2019s been known that Biden was hardly the only American or Western official to demand Shokin\u2019s ouster. But this pretty well spells out how this was a government-wide initiative. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not possible Biden had other motives, but there is no evidence he did anything corrupt, and the timeline bolsters the idea that this was simply the administration\u2019s stance on Ukraine.\n\n4. Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor was a busy bee on U.S. matters around the Ukrainian election\n\nUkraine held the first round of its election this year on March 31 and the second round on April 21. And around this time, then-Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko was a very busy man when it came to matters involving the United States.\n\nAD\n\nHe met with Giuliani a number of times and began lodging questionable allegations involving both the Bidens and then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.\n\nAD\n\nLet\u2019s recap:\n\nJan. 2019: Giuliani and Lutsenko meet in New York, as Bloomberg later reports. Mid-February: Giuliani again meets with Lutsenko, this time in Warsaw, according to the whistleblower. March: With Ukraine\u2019s March 31 election looming, Lutsenko begins making allegations about the Bidens\u2019 activities in Ukraine. The whistleblower notes that Lutsenko works for the incumbent, Poroshenko, who had been trailing Zelensky. Zelensky had pledged to replace Lutsenko. March 20: In an interview with pro-Trump columnist John Solomon, Lutsenko alleges that Yovanovitch gave him \u201ca list of people whom we should not prosecute.\u201d The State Department calls the claim an \u201coutright fabrication,\u201d but Trump promotes the story in a tweet. March 31: The first round of Ukraine\u2019s presidential election is held. Poroshenko and Zelensky head to a runoff. April 1: After speaking with Lutsenko, Solomon reports that a probe into Joe Biden\u2019s push to fire Lutsenko\u2019s predecessor is underway. Lutsenko tells Solomon that he wants to present his evidence to Attorney General William P. Barr. April 18: Lutsenko retracts his claim that Yovanovitch gave him a list of people not to prosecute. April 21: Zelensky, a former TV comedian, is elected president of Ukraine with 73 percent of the vote. Trump calls him to offer his congratulations.\n\nThe whistleblower appeared to suggest there might be some kind of connection between Lutsenko doing things that Giuliani wanted and the Ukrainian election, though it\u2019s not clear what.\n\nOne logical theory would be that he wanted to win fans in the Trump administration so that it would apply pressure on Zelensky to keep him as prosecutor general. And indeed, Trump suggested exactly that to Zelensky on their July 25 phone call.\n\n\u201cGood because I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good, and he was shut down and that\u2019s really unfair,\u201d Trump said, according to the rough transcript produced by the White House. \u201cA lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved.\u201d\n\nTrump added later: \u201cI heard the prosecutor was treated very badly, and he was a very fair prosecutor, so good luck with everything.\u201d\n\nThere are many important gaps in this timeline and questions about how events do or do not relate to one another. But as they\u2019re filled in, we\u2019ll keep updating it.\n\nAD", "description": "The Fix has been keeping a timeline of the key events.
