UPDATE 2-Oil slips on weak demand outlook, returning Saudi supply\n\n(Recasts headline and lead, updates prices)\n\nBy Roslan Khasawneh\n\nSINGAPORE, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged lower on\n\nThursday, extending losses from the previous two sessions, as\n\nSaudi Arabia quickly regained production volumes after an attack\n\non its oil facilities and amid increasing signs of slowing\n\ndemand.\n\nBrent crude futures were at $62.36 a barrel, down 3\n\ncents, or 0.1%, from the previous close, by 0659 GMT.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were\n\n9 cents lower, or 0.2%, to $56.40 a barrel.\n\nBrent and WTI prices have dropped 3.7% and 3.8%,\n\nrespectively, since their close on Monday, weighed down by a\n\nsurprise 2.4 million-barrel build in U.S. crude inventories last\n\nweek, and a faster-than-expected recovery of Saudi output\n\ncapacity after the Sept. 14 attacks on two of its oil processing\n\nplants.\n\nPrices found slight support on hopes that the U.S.-China\n\ntrade dispute may ease, potentially boosting oil demand.\n\nU.S. President Trump said on Wednesday - a day after a\n\nstinging rebuke to China for its trade practices - that Beijing\n\nwanted to make a deal \"very badly\" and that a deal \"could happen\n\nsooner than you think\".\n\nTrump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also signed a\n\nlimited trade deal that would open up Japanese markets to some\n\n$7 billion worth of U.S. products annually.\n\nAnalysts said there was little else besides the slightly\n\nmore positive outlook on the trade talks to help lift crude\n\nfutures higher.\n\n\"There's not too much to be cheery about on oil markets\n\ntoday,\" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia\n\nPacific at OANDA.\n\n\"Saudi Arabia is restoring production much faster than\n\nexpected (and) the EIA crude inventories came in higher,\" he\n\nsaid.\n\nBoth Brent and WTI on Wednesday fell to their lowest since\n\nthe attacks on Saudi Arabia. EIA/S\n\nCrude futures were also pressured by sluggish economic data\n\nin leading European economies and Japan, analysts said.\n\n\n\n\"Fundamentally, a much weaker than expected Germany\n\nmanufacturer PMI data painted a tepid outlook for energy\n\ndemand,\" said Margaret Yang, market analyst at CMC Markets.\n\n\"This bearish outlook is further strengthened by a rise in\n\nU.S. crude oil stockpile in the past weeks,\" said Yang.\n\nA firmer dollar , which posted its sharpest daily gain\n\nin three months overnight and held steady in Asian trade, also\n\nweighed on oil prices as it makes dollar-traded fuel imports\n\nmore costly for countries using other currencies.\n\n\"Barring new inputs to adjust price expectations, both\n\ncontracts are in grave danger of fully unwinding their Saudi\n\nattack rallies and retesting their pre-attack lows, around\n\n$60.00 (for Brent) and $54.00 (for WTI),\" Halley said.\n\n\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 2-Oil slips on weak demand outlook, returning Saudi supply", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA760SZ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
