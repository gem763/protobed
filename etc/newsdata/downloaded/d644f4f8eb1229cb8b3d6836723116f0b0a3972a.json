He also won the 2002 Commonwealth title and competed in two Olympic Games.\n\nA father of one, Fallon retired in 2011 and coached in Austria before becoming head coach earlier this year of the Welsh Judo Association.\n\nIt was reported at his inquest that the police were called at 6pm on July 14 after he had told his partner earlier in the day that she would never see him again. He left a last message that evening at 6.05pm as well as what was described as a \u201cpersonal and private\u201d email. A search began near the Wrekin in Shropshire and Fallon\u2019s body was found the following morning. \u201cWithout going into detail, Craig was then found and he was deceased,\u201d said Ellery.", "description": "Craig Fallon, the former world judo champion, emailed his partner and said \u201cremember, this was my choice\u201d before being found dead in woodland earlier this year.", "authors": ["Jeremy Wilson", "Chief Sports Reporter", "Paul Hayward"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/judo/2019/10/30/TELEMMGLPICT000204117573-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwUerLcqnHojtWwrXLbqzqec.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
