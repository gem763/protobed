Those headlines were excited utterances.\"\n\nBruce continued by imitating what she imagined to be the various newsroom reactions to the al-Baghdadi raid: \"We've got this great plan and now he's ruined it -- for us.\"\n\nIn fact, Bruce argued, the media refuse to give Trump credit for seeing through a major foreign policy objective.\n\n\"From the campaign on for this president -- and his people around him have confirmed this as well -- dealing with ISIS has been a number one priority. Another promise kept,\" she said.\n\n\"By the way,\" Bruce continued. \"The day after we obliterated al-Baghdadi, we got their spokesman. So they literally eliminated the top of the caliphate. So President Trump dealt with ISIS, which grew under Obama's presidency, of course.\"\n\nBRUCE: HARVEY WEINSTEIN IS REASON HILLARY CLINTON SHOULD NEVER AGAIN RUN FOR PRESIDENT\n\nHowever, \"there was one headline that you could trust and this was from The New York Post,\" said Bruce.\n\nThe New York Post headline read, \"Rot in Hell, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\"\n\n\"Plain, simple, straight across,\" concluded Bruce. \"There is no debate here about what kind of a maniac this guy was.\"\n\nFor Bruce's full remarks join Fox Nation and watch \"Get Tammy Bruce\" today.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\n\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but available only for Fox Nation subscribers.
