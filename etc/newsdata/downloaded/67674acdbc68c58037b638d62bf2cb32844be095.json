The CRISPR gene editing technique is being used an increasing amount in health research because it can change the building blocks of the body. At a basic level, CRISPR works as a DNA cutting-and-pasting operation. Technically called CRISPR-Cas9, the process involves sending new strands of DNA and enzymes into organisms to edit their genes. In humans, genes act as blueprints for many processes and characteristics in the body \u2013 they dictate everything from the colour of your eyes and hair to whether or not you have cancer. The components of CRISPR-Cas9 \u2013 the DNA sequence and the enzymes needed to implant it \u2013 are often sent into the body on the back of a harmless virus so scientists can control where they go. Cas9 enzymes can then cut strands of DNA, effectively turning off a gene, or remove sections of DNA to be replaced with the CRISPRs, which are new sections sent in to change the gene and have an effect they have been pre-programmed to produce. But the process is controversial because it could be used to change babies in the womb \u2013 initially to treat diseases \u2013 but could lead to a rise in 'designer babies' as doctors offer ways to change embryos' DNA.

Each new baby for this pair would be deaf without gene mutation editing.'\n\nAlthough he cannot be sure it will work, he knows exactly which bit of DNA to target \u2013 position 35 of the GJB2 gene.\n\nThe gene error is fairly common in western Siberia, the New Scientist said, and if inherited from both parents it leads to complete deafness from birth.\n\nThe couples are willing and have no other option to stop their children being born unable to hear.\n\nBut scientists say would-be healthy children should not be the guinea pigs for CRISPR.\n\nCrispr works by cutting DNA in a precise place, allowing small portions of a gene to be removed and replaced with a different one created in a lab\n\nDespite not being able to hear, the children's lives would not be endangered by their condition and they would be able to lead relatively normal lives.\n\n'The first human trials should start with embryos or infants with nothing to lose, with fatal conditions,' Professor Julian Savulescu, from the University of Oxford, told the New Scientist.\n\n'You should not be starting with an embryo which stands to lead a pretty normal life.'\n\nChinese scientist He Jiankui earlier this year revealed he had used Crispr to edit embryos in a lab to try and protect them from inheriting HIV from their fathers, and twins had been born as a result.\n\nScientists in China and around the world condemned him and said it was irresponsible to experiment on embryos which would be used in pregnancy.\n\nTransmission of HIV from the father is rare if the mother doesn't have the disease, and there are other, less dangerous ways of preventing it.\n\nAn international statement published in November by science organisations in the US, UK and China said the risks are currently 'too great' to use gene editing on embryos which will become living people \u2013 called germline editing.\n\nThey said the case of Dr He was 'unexpected and deeply disturbing' and 'failed to meet ethical standards'.\n\nMr Rebrikov has admitted he also wants to try similar work to protect children from inheriting the virus from their mothers.\n\nBut the statement released in November said Crispr should only be used on living people if there is 'an absence of reasonable alternatives'.\n\nA global group of scientists also called for a ban on all germline editing in March this year.\n\nIn a statement published in the scientific journal, Nature, researchers from the US, Canada and Germany said Crispr is 'not yet safe or effective enough to justify any use in the clinic'.\n\nThey added: 'There is wide agreement in the scientific community that, for clinical germline editing, the risk of failing to make the desired change or of introducing unintended mutations (off-target effects) is still unacceptably high.'", "description": "Vladimir Putin is the only one who can green-light the use of the controversial gene-editing technology, and will have the ear of his daughter Maria Vorontsova, an endocrinologist.", "authors": ["Joe Middleton For Mailonline", "Sam Blanchard Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/30/23/19128240-0-image-a-35_1569880888018.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
