High bonuses and taxpayer bailouts in the financial crisis a decade ago led to a loss of public trust in banking that has yet to be fully regained.\n\n\u201cEnvironmental risk and opportunity is beginning to reshape the way we look at business planning and economic growth,\u201d UK Finance Chief Executive Stephen Jones will tell the trade body\u2019s annual dinner.\n\n\u201cA broad base of stakeholder interests, from regulators, to investors, employees and customers are increasingly challenging the banking and finance to find more innovative and sustainable ways in which to operate,\u201d he will say, according to prepared remarks.\n\nThe United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative principles will be launched during the annual U.N. General Assembly in New York next week.\n\nApplying the principles will shape how financial products are designed and bring environmental and other \u201csustainability\u201d factors into lending decisions and even the frequency of corporate travel, Jones said.\n\nBritain\u2019s financial sector is facing uncertainty over future access to the European Union, its biggest customer, as the UK readies to leave the bloc next month.\n\nBankers should not take the UK\u2019s leading position as a global financial centre for granted, added UK Finance Chair Bob Wigley.\n\nUK Finance has asked Britain\u2019s government to phase out a levy on bank balance sheets that was introduced after the financial crisis, Wigley said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that many in our country still need persuading that the measures we seek to maintain and enhance the industry\u2019s future competitiveness are worth it,\u201d Jones will say.\n\n\u201cOur industry takes a lot of abuse. And sometimes \u2013 just sometimes \u2013 some of us deserve some of it \u2013 but at least we are collectively responsible for putting it right when that happens.\u201d", "description": "Britain's banks will implement U.N.-backed \"responsible banking\" principles being launched next week that will influence lending and company behaviour, British banking trade body UK Finance said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Huw Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431351795&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H1T2", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
