Its upload page specifically stated, \u201cDo not upload adult porn\u201d.\n\n\u201cDarknet sites that profit from the sexual exploitation of children are among the most vile and reprehensible forms of criminal behaviour,\u201d US assistant attorney general, Brian Benczkowski, said.\n\nHome Office to fund use of AI to help catch dark web paedophiles Read more\n\nOfficials have rescued at least 23 underage victims in the United States, Britain and Spain who were being actively abused by users of the site, the justice department said. Many children in the videos have not yet been identified.\n\nThe site\u2019s vast library \u2013 nearly half of it consisting of images never seen before by law enforcement \u2013 is an illustration of what authorities say is an explosion of sexual abuse content online. In a statement, Britain\u2019s National Crime Agency said officials were seeing \u201cincreases in severity, scale and complexity\u201d.\n\nWelcome To Video\u2019s operator, a South Korean named Jong Woo Son, 23, and 337 users in 12 different countries, have been charged so far, authorities said.\n\nSon, currently serving an 18-month sentence in South Korea, was also indicted on federal charges in Washington.\n\nSeveral other people charged in the case have already been convicted and are serving prison sentences of up to 15 years, according to the justice department officials.\n\nWelcome To Video is one of the first websites to monetise child sexual abuse using bitcoin, which allows users to hide their identities during financial transactions.\n\nUsers were able to redeem the digital currency in return for \u201cpoints\u201d that they could spend downloading videos or buying all-you-can watch \u201cVIP\u201d accounts. Points could also be earned by uploading child sexual abuse images.\n\n\u201cThese are the bottom feeders of the criminal world,\u201d said Don Fort, chief of criminal investigation at the US internal revenue service (IRS), which initiated the investigation.\n\nThe justice department said the site collected at least $370,000 worth of bitcoin before it was taken down in March 2018 and that the currency was laundered through three unnamed digital currency exchanges.\n\nFort said the investigation was triggered by a tip to the IRS from a confidential source. However, Britain\u2019s National Crime Agency said it came across the site during an investigation into a British academic who in October 2017 pleaded guilty to blackmailing more than 50 people, including teenagers, into sending him images that he shared online.\n\nIn a statement, British authorities said the National Crime Agency\u2019s cybercrime unit deployed \u201cspecialist capabilities\u201d to identify the server\u2019s location.\n\nThe justice department gave a different explanation, saying that Welcome To Video\u2019s site was leaking its server\u2019s South Korean internet protocol address to the open internet.", "description": "South Korean-based site accepted digital currency for access to videos, with victims rescued in US, UK and Spain", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d8b5769343c14ed2ce89a13db4be4634e72dc31/0_71_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f58e1471f63f02c7cf1dc171adedc9a9", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
