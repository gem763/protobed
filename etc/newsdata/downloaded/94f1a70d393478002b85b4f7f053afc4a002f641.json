According to the sheriff\u2019s department, the family is cooperating with the investigation and there is no evidence that abortions took place on Klopfer\u2019s property.\n\nThe coroner\u2019s office counted 2,246 preserved fetal remains before taking possession of them. Two thousand, two hundred forty-six.\n\nKlopfer died on Sept. 3. The South Bend Tribune had described him as \u201clikely Indiana\u2019s most prolific abortion doctor.\u201d\n\nHis reasons for storing the bodies of thousands of aborted babies at his home remains unclear. What is clear, however, is that Klopfer performed abortions on a staggeringly industrial scale, \u201cwith numbers going into the tens of thousands of procedures in multiple counties over several decades.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Klopfer\u2019s medical license was suspended for violating a number of notice and documentation requirements. At one point during his practice, he performed an abortion on a 10-year-old girl who had been raped by her uncle, according to the South Bend Tribune.\n\nKlopfer did not inform law enforcement of the rape and released the child to her parents, who were aware of the rape and would not take legal action.\n\nA surveyor who inspected one of his clinics described it as \u201crundown, not well-maintained,\u201d and with a number of deficiencies, which included \u201cequipment not being properly maintained; expired medications in an emergency drug kit; lack of infection control practices; no log of cleaning procedure rooms; and incomplete personnel policies.\u201d\n\nAt the time of his suspension, an Indiana Medical Licensing Board member spoke of Klopfer\u2019s \u201cprofessional incompetence.\u201d\n\nWell, that\u2019s one way to put it.\n\nKlopfer\u2019s dangerous incompetence highlights the need for state laws that uphold commonsense health and safety standards in abortion facilities.\n\nBeyond that, this disturbing discovery reminds us that abortion victims rarely receive humane, dignified treatment after the procedure that ends their lives.\n\nIn recent years, a number of states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Texas have enacted fetal burial laws, which recognize that the bodies of pre-born children are, in fact, human and should be treated accordingly\u2014not disposed of along with used needles, surgical products, and animal carcasses (or in the case of Klopfer, kept preserved in the abortionist\u2019s home).\n\nLess than four months ago, the Supreme Court upheld an Indiana law that requires proper burial of abortion victims. It appears that Klopfer, whose license was suspended in 2016, had ceased committing abortions before that requirement went into effect.\n\nIt is heartbreaking that even in death, after having suffered the violence of abortion, the victims are so often not treated with dignity and care.\n\nLawmakers around the country should follow the example of Indiana and other states and ensure, at the very least, the humane treatment of the remains of unborn children whose lives were cut short by abortion.", "description": "Americans are reacting in disgust at the discovery of more than 2,000 fetal remains uncovered at the home of a deceased abortion doctor.", "authors": ["Melanie Israel", "Research Associate", "Melanie Is A Research Associate In The Devos Center For Religion", "Civil Society At The Heritage Foundation."], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-09/GettyImages-691300826.jpg?itok=t-VXAt6u", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
