I just wish they would go away.\"\n\nDespite a number of a setbacks, including a dramatic cut in its valuation, the office-sharing start-up said it's full speed ahead, with sources telling CNBC that the IPO roadshow could kick off as soon as Monday.\n\n\"I don't want WeWork at any price,\" Cramer said. \"There are certain deals that can come and they can just really take the air out of any market.\"\n\nWeWork's plans to move forward despite the reported advice from its major investor, SoftBank, which will likely face a multibillion-dollar write-down if the company debuts at a valuation between $15 billion and $20 billion. SoftBank invested $2 billion in WeWork in January at a valuation of $47 billion. On Friday, CNBC's David Faber was hearing the valuation could be $15 billion or lower.\n\n\"Why can't they just say, 'Hey, we're awful and we're going to wait until we're good again,'\" Cramer said. \"We don't want to give them money. They're just going to screw up the market,\" the \"Mad Money\" host added.\n\nOn Friday, in an amended IPO filing, The We Co., owner of WeWork, announced plans to list on the Nasdaq.\n\nAddressing sharp criticism over its corporate governance, WeWork also reduced founder and CEO Adam Neumann's voting power. The filing also said that \"no members of Adam's family will sit on our board.\"\n\nEarlier this month, WeWork announced that Neumann would return a controversial $5.9 million trademark payment. The company also appointed its first female director to the board.", "description": "WeWork should pull its IPO because the negative sentiment around slashing its valuation could be contagious in the overall stock market, says CNBC's Jim Cramer.", "authors": ["Matthew J.
