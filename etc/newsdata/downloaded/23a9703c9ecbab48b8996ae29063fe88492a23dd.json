He was 96.\n\nMarcus Tischbier, a representative of the district mayor\u2019s office in Nordstemmen, the village where Mr. Muenter lived, confirmed the death but said he had no further details.\n\nMr. Muenter was a sergeant with the 12th SS Panzer Division \u201cHitler Youth,\u201d which was responsible for the massacre of 86 men in Ascq, France, in April 1944, about two months before the Allied landing at Normandy.\n\nAfter partisans blew up a railroad line being used to shuttle German troops to Normandy, Mr. Muenter and other members of the division were ordered to arrest all males in the town. The victims, ranging from teenagers to the elderly, were lined up and shot.\n\nHe was convicted in absentia of war crimes and sentenced to death by a French court after the war, along with other participants in the massacre. By the time he was tracked down in 2013 \u2014 in the Lower Saxony village where he lived by the great-grandson of one of the Ascq victims \u2014 the statute of limitations had passed.\n\nGerman prosecutors opened a new investigation of Mr. Muenter on suspicion of his being an accessory to murder, but they had to shelve the case after determining they could not charge him again for the same crime.\n\nIn a strange twist, prosecutors in Hildesheim charged Mr. Muenter earlier this year with incitement after he appeared on a television documentary in which he defended the shooting of the prisoners in Ascq and disputed the Nazi Holocaust.\n\nHolocaust denial is a crime in Germany, and prosecutors opened their investigation after Mr. Muenter appeared on the ARD public television show in 2018.\n\nIn the documentary, he said he had not shot anyone personally in Ascq, but maintained that the killings were justified because the prisoners had tried to escape.\n\n\u201cIf I arrest the men, then I have the responsibility for them, and if they run away, I have a right to shoot them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also disputed the fact that 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust, saying \u201cwe didn\u2019t have that many Jews here at that time, that\u2019s already been disproved.\u201d\n\nARD also reported that Mr. Muenter had close ties to neo-Nazi groups in recent years, talking to them about his experiences in the SS.\n\nHis incitement case was still pending trial when he died.", "description": "He was a sergeant in an SS division responsible for the massacre of 86 men in Ascq, France, in April 1944, about two months before the Allied landing at Normandy.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
