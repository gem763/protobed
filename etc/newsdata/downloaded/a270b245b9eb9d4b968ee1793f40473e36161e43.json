Odorizzi\u2019s arm wasn\u2019t the problem.\n\n\u201cHe asked about my shoulder and I said that was fine - I was just getting the blood flow going again - but my hamstring was cramping a little,\u201d Odorizzi said. \u201cI could have kept going, but taking me out was probably the smart thing.\u201d\n\nBaldelli agreed and brought in Kyle Gibson.\n\n\u201cUnder different circumstances, I would have left Jake out there, but this way we are sure he\u2019s going to be fine going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s magic number to clinch the division is two over Cleveland. The Indians beat the White Sox 11-0 later Tuesday.\n\nOdorizzi (15-7) hadn\u2019t allowed a hit since Harold Castro\u2019s bunt single in the first and left having struck out six and allowed one run.\n\n\u201cI felt great,\u201d he said. \u201cI just need to hydrate a little more.\u201d\n\nThe Twins improved to 97-60, their most victories since going 98-64 in 1970. With three wins in their final five games, they can become the record fourth club with 100 wins this season.\n\nTaylor Rogers pitched a perfect ninth for his 29th save. It was his first appearance since allowing three runs in a loss to Kansas City on Saturday.\n\nDetroit (46-110) reached 110 losses for the second time, 16 years after setting the AL record of 119. With one more loss or a victory by Baltimore, the club would be assured the No. 1 pick in next year\u2019s amateur draft.\n\n\u201cThe Twins score millions of runs and we held them to four,\u201d Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire said. \u201cWe had chances, too. We definitely had chances.\u201d\n\nThe Tigers need to win one of their final two home games to avoid tying the 1939 St. Louis Browns\u2019 record of 59 home losses.\n\nThe delay that started the confusion over Odorizzi\u2019s health was caused by Minnesota\u2019s four-run seventh inning.\n\nTigers starter Spencer Turnbull started the game with six scoreless innings, but couldn\u2019t get an out in the seventh. Jake Cave led off with a single and LaMonte Wade Jr. went the other way to beat the shift for a double.\n\n\u201cIt is tough, because I didn\u2019t leave the guys with a good situation,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cI think I did pretty well, but it is hard to be excited when you leave with two guys on and no one out in a 1-0 game.\u201d\n\nAstudillo hit David McKay\u2019s third pitch up the middle for a two-run single, ending Turnbull\u2019s chance at a win. Rosario added a two-run double off Nick Ramirez to make it 4-1.\n\n\u201cThe guys in the lower part of the order were getting good at-bats all night, but we couldn\u2019t string anything together until they got us going in the seventh,\u201d Baldelli said.\n\nTurnbull (3-16) allowed six hits and two walks in six-plus innings. Turnbull has an 0-12 career record at home - the most losses by any major league pitcher without a home win.\n\nThe Tigers scored in the first. Dawel Lugo doubled, took third on Castro\u2019s bunt and scored on Jeimer Candelario\u2019s sacrifice fly.\n\nThe Tigers put runners on the corners in the seventh, but Gibson struck out Jake Rogers to end the inning. Lugo made it 4-2 with an RBI double in the eighth.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nTwins: 1B Marwin Gonzalez was a late scratch due to tightness in his right oblique muscle. He was replaced by Astudillo and is listed as day-to-day.\n\nTigers: DH Miguel Cabrera will have his right knee examined by several specialists after the season in the hopes of finding a solution to the chronic pain that turned him into a full-time DH this season. Cabrera has missed the last three games, but hopes to play Wednesday.\n\nPOSTSEASON WEAPON\n\nGibson\u2019s two innings of relief might have been a preview of his role in October. Gibson isn\u2019t at full strength while dealing with ulcerative colitis.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to see what he could do throwing all out for a couple innings instead of having to grind through six or seven,\u201d Baldelli said. \u201cWe\u2019re planning to give him one more outing like that before the end of the regular season.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe teams play the second of a three-game series Wednesday evening, with Detroit\u2019s Daniel Norris (3-13, 4.58) scheduled to open against Twins rookie Randy Dobnak (1-1, 2.01).\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Minnesota Twins took another step toward an AL Central title with a 4-2 win over the Detroit Tigers on Tuesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Hogg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/twins_tigers_baseball_99149_c0-146-3500-2186_s1770x1032.jpg?28e1112a076ec7fecf74d701fc168de288d8a301", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
