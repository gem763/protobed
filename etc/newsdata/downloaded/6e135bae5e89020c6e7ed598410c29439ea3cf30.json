Other similar objects dating back as far as about 7,000 years during Neolithic times have been found in various other locations, the researchers said.\n\nThese are Bronze Age feeding vessels from Vienna, Oberleis, V\u00f6sendorf and Franzhausen-Kokoron (from left to right), dated to around 1200-800 BC. (Katharina Rebay-Salisbury)\n\n\"I think this has provided us the first direct evidence of what foods baby were eating or being weaned onto in prehistory,\" said biomolecular archeologist Julie Dunne, of the University of Bristol in Britain, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature.\n\n\"I think this shows us the love and care these prehistoric people had for their babies.\"\n\nThese objects, little enough to fit in a baby's hands, served as vessels for milk, with a narrow spout for the baby to suckle liquid. While the three objects examined for the study were somewhat plain, others boasted lively shapes, including animal heads with long ears or horns and human-looking feet.\n\nMeant as toys too?\n\n\"I find them incredibly cute. And prehistoric people may have thought so, too \u2014 they would certainly have a dual function of entertaining the children just like modern stuffed animals,\" said archeologist Katharina Rebay-Salisbury of the Institute for Oriental and European Archaeology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, a study co-author.\n\n\"They testify to the creativity and playfulness we often forget to attribute to our ancestors.\"\n\nAn artist's prehistoric family scene shows infant being fed with baby bottle similar to those found by archeologists. They allowed animal milk to be substituted for breastfeeding, and allowed babies to be fed by people other than their mother. (Christian Bisig/Arch\u00e4ologie der Schweiz.)\n\nLife at the time was not easy, Rebay-Salisbury added, with many people living in unhygienic conditions, experiencing famine and disease, and facing low life expectancy. During the Bronze Age and subsequent Iron Age in Europe, perhaps about a third of all newborns died before their first birthday and only about half of children reached adulthood, Rebay-Salisbury said.\n\nThese feeding vessels may have made life easier for mothers, as animal milk could substitute for breastfeeding, the researchers said.\n\n\"Duties of mothering \u2014 amongst which feeding is an important one \u2014 can also be undertaken by other members of the community when children are fed with feeding vessels,\" Rebay-Salisbury said.", "description": "Ceramic vessels, sometimes fashioned in whimsical animal forms, were used thousands of years ago as baby bottles to give animal milk to infants, according to scientists, offering an intriguing look at how and what infants were fed in prehistoric times.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5297897.1569498527!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/baby-with-ancient-baby-bottle.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
