Nik Simon listened in.\n\nBack in 2015, Eddie Jones told the England players they could go and be the best in the world\n\nJAMES HASKELL: Morning!\n\nDYLAN HARTLEY: Are we live?\n\nJH: We are live so please do not swear. Before we shed a bit of light on your New Zealand childhood - sticks, mud, walking to school barefoot - what are your memories of playing the All Blacks in November when England lost by one point?\n\nDH: The feeling from that game is that these guys are beatable. There were a couple of key moments. Courtney Lawes offside - was he? Sam Underhill turning Beauden Barrett inside out to score a brilliant try that's disallowed. If that's allowed, then it's a different result. Everything we preached in the week came to life in the first 40 minutes... Then I got subbed off at half-time!\n\nIf small errors hadn't occurred England would have beaten New Zealand in November last year\n\nJH: What you're saying is that if Dylan Hartley had stayed on then England would have won?\n\nDH: I saw a quote from Owen Farrell this week saying that the All Blacks bleed, just like we do. There are Lions players, Saracens players, Exeter players who all know how to win big games. Then you've got Sam Underhill and Tom Curry who don't have that experience but they have relentless exuberance. They're young guys having the tournament of their lives and they fear nothing. The blend of this England team is the perfect mix.\n\nJH: I loved the way Eddie came out at his press conference on Monday, talking about spying and throwing grenades left, right and centre. It was straight from the Jose Mourinho playbook and deflected attention from his players. Sometimes people spook themselves out playing the All Blacks and I don't think Eddie will be talking about them too much in camp.\n\nDH: Rugby fans and media all build that up. We're paying lip service to the whole mystique now, which annoys me. You know as well as I do, Hask, that you go into a game with a burning belief that you're going to win. Otherwise there's no point playing. I know for a man, one to 23, England believe they can win. New Zealand are the current champions, the No 1 team in the world, but they are beatable.\n\nFlip it on its head. Let's talk about the machine that is England. This is a game that everyone wants to see. England's form has been great. They put 40 points on a quality opposition in the quarter-final.\n\nThe team has basically primed itself to this point. You and I were involved from the start four years ago and we talked about winning the World Cup. Eddie said: 'You might not believe me right now, but you can be the best team in the world and you're going to win the World Cup. You're going to change your lives and you're going to change your families' lives. You're going to inspire the nation.'\n\nEngland players, including Anthony Watson (pictured), will believe they can win the game\n\nTraining for the past four years has been relentless with everyone working towards that goal\n\nFour years of work is coming to a head. If you look at how the team has built, we stuttered in the middle but came back and built and built and built. The plan is coming together and we've come to a point where we should be contending.\n\nThree years into the programme, Eddie told me that he reckoned three-quarters of the room didn't believe him in that initial meeting. Slowly the belief in the team has grown - and rightly so. When you start believing that you can win the World Cup, it's self-fulfilling. It's a powerful thing. I would have believed anything Eddie told me.\n\nJH: I genuinely looked at him in that meeting and believed him because he's been there and done it. Sometimes you have coaches who stand up and talk who haven't been anywhere near it. You think, \"You couldn't win a raffle, let alone the World Cup.\"\n\nDH: One hundred per cent agree. You've seen the flipchart presentations at the start of the season. A few weeks later that energy's gone. With Eddie, every day it's, \"We're going to be the best. We train to win. Do you want to win the World Cup? Do you want to change your lives?\" He would remind us every single day. Then players start talking about it and your standards creep up. Everything goes up a level because you want to be winners.\n\nJH: It was relentless. Sometimes the steam runs out but with Eddie the standards never drop for a single session. He'd walk past you in training and say, \"Hask, you can be the best tackler in the world,\" and he'd tell you how you were going to do it. It was always there. Everyone talks about the All Blacks narrative except the players. Being a humble lad from New Zealand, Dylan, how are the All Blacks regarded there?\n\nDH: When you look at New Zealand's national identity, it is the All Blacks. What puts them on the map and gets them recognition around the world? Rugby. How many people do you meet who don't know rugby but know that thing where you stick your tongue out? Some people don't know what rugby is but they know what the All Blacks are and what the haka is. In a country of 4.5million, it gives them a lot of pride.\n\nRugby is at the heart of New Zealand's national identity, they are renowned for their rugby\n\nMany people around the world associate the country of New Zealand with the haka routine\n\nJH: S*** haircuts, s*** fashion but unbelievably good rugby players! I was in the gym in Tokyo the other day and...\n\nDH: Shock!\n\nJH:...and there were seven Japanese people wearing Kiwi vests. Not even they could bring themselves to support England!\n\nDH: Every time I played the All Blacks I would call my parents who live in New Zealand. They would say, \"Good luck for the weekend. We hope you play really well. And, erm, that's it.\" I would be on the phone saying, \"And.... what?\" They'd say, \"Well, we obviously don't want England to win... we're All Blacks supporters!\" Even with my own family I was up against it!\n\nJH: I love the fact that they don't have broadcasting rights over there so all the Kiwis are having to stream the games online. They still have dial-up broadband through a modem, where you have to pay 10 pence a minute, and all these farmers are having a riot because they can't stream it. Walking down the river trying to figure out what streaming is!\n\nDH: You're too much, Hask!\n\nJH: How are you feeling personally about the match? I felt quite sad and jealous that I'm missing out on a semi-final - having never got close and had a few bad experiences. Now I'm genuinely excited to watch it.\n\nDH: I've kind of parked it. I'm at ease watching it now. It's easier to enjoy it when you're not thinking, \"Am I going to play? Am I not going to play?\" Me and you, Hask, were part of the foundation building but the team has grown and grown and grown. We had that tough run which put the spotlight on a few things and they went away and worked bloody hard. Now the team has come back.\n\nEngland's form under Eddie Jones dipped in 2018 but they are in form going into the semi final\n\nJones has a big decision to make whether to pair Tom Curry (right) and Sam Underhill together\n\nImagine how tough Eddie's job is with selection right now... do you stick with Underhill-Curry? Do you put in another lineout option because the All Blacks have picked Scott Barrett at No 6? It's so malleable with all the depth they've got. Billy Vunipola and Courtney Lawes are going about their business, banging people, but they're not even getting talked about because these young back-row boys are taking all the plaudits.\n\nThat's the level you want to be at, where you've got a world-class player not taking the headlines because of these new kids on the block. Imagine Mark Wilson being told now, \"I want you to come on and make a difference\". He will be foaming at the mouth.\n\nA word on Joe Launchbury - has he been knocking everyone over all over Tokyo with his big bum?\n\nJH: Luckily, they don't have too many paper walls because he would have taken them out! He's an incredible player and he's barely had a look-in. He'll be pulling down mauls, he'll be flying through. You know what he's like when he doesn't get his way.\n\nDH: Fordy coming to 10 is significant. Australia gave us an opportunity to give them a hiding, playing from their own half. The All Blacks are much more savvy than that. Bringing George to 10, with attacking kicks, game management, territory, shows this game is going to be a lot different.\n\nJH: England will play like England and the All Blacks will play like the All Blacks. From the start, Eddie said we want a good set-piece and we want to smash the hell out of people in defence. We're not going to try to do it anyone else's way. It's a meeting of two styles. It might seem like the biggest thing in the world but it's just a game and you have to go out and enjoy it.\n\nGeorge Ford has been instrumental and England will look for to benefit from his attacking style\n\nDH: The All Blacks come to life in unstructured play, with heads up rugby. But if you take away any stereotypes and look at the stats, you've got two teams who do the basics really well. People traditionally say, \"England: scrum, defence, territory.\" Nah, sorry... get the ball to Anthony Watson or Elliot Daly and they can go toe-to-toe. It sets up a hell of a game. It'll be won on a couple of key moments: who is going to drop off for that split second in counter-attack?\n\nJH: Before they leave for the stadium, he'll probably have his meeting with the flipboard and talk about how good they can be. In the changing room, I think he'll be light-hearted, smiling, having little words with people, not putting too much pressure on the players. This is the culmination of everything he's done. If you haven't done the work by now, you're screwed. A few coaches made motivational videos like knock-off Gladiator remixes and they were some of the worst things I've ever seen. That's not Eddie.\n\nDH: He used to come up to me and say, \"Is it your last game mate?\" Cheers, Eddie.\n\nThere's no point poking and prodding and firing it up. He'll say you've done everything you can, now free yourself up for the occasion. It's there for the taking.", "description": "Four years of preparation will boil down to 80 minutes on Saturday when England face the All Blacks in the biggest rugby match for years in a game that will define the era of Eddie Jones.", "authors": ["James Haskell", "Dylan Hartley For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/23/20200044-0-image-a-7_1572041284714.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
