But the adaptation of Stephen King's \"Doctor Sleep\" is more likely to keep you awake at night with the fresher stuff than the retreads.\n\nA sequel to \"The Shining\" \u2013 which finds a middle ground between King's original 1977 novel and Stanley Kubrick\u2019s seminal 1980 movie \u2013 \"Doctor Sleep\" (\u2605\u2605\u2605 out of four; rated R; in theaters Nov. 8) catches up with Danny Torrance (Ewan McGregor) decades after his crazed dad tried to kill him at their horrifyingly spooky Colorado lodging.\n\nBut while its predecessor was about addiction, writer/director Mike Flanagan\u2019s follow-up interestingly examines the recovery and redemption of a haunted man. That is, when it\u2019s not trying to scare the pants off you with a family of hippie psychic vampires and their villainous matriarch.\n\n'Doctor Sleep': Ewan McGregor says he knows his character better than Stephen King does\n\n'In the Tall Grass': Things get doubly freaky when Stephen King and son Joe Hill team up\n\nWhile Danny physically survived the trauma of the Overlook, he didn\u2019t escape the phantoms that still want to consume his psychic powers, or \u201cshine.\u201d He finds a way to lock them away, but spends decades trying to suppress his abilities using drugs and alcohol. The adult Dan winds up in New Hampshire, gets sober with the help of a friend (Cliff Curtis) and works at a hospice, where he\u2019s able to use his shine to help terminal patients die comfortably, thus earning the nickname \u201cDoctor Sleep\u201d.\n\nAs an adult, Dan Torrance (Ewan McGregor) is still haunted by the demons of his childhood in \"The Shining\" sequel \"Doctor Sleep.\" (Photo: JESSICA MIGLIO)\n\nDuring this time, Dan is also contacted psychically by Abra Stone (Kyliegh Curran), a young girl with a stronger shine who reaches out to form a bond with someone like her. But Abra enlists his help after she psychically feels the brutal murder of a boy with similar abilities by a shady, ancient troupe known as the True Knot. Led by the enigmatic Rose the Hat (Rebecca Ferguson), they remain semi-immortal by feeding off the psychic essence of children like Abra. (Rose\u2019s recruitment mantra is \u201cLive long, stay young, eat well.\u201d) And when Abra surfaces on their radar, Dan becomes involved in a cross-country cat-and-mouse chase that culminates in a snowy, bring-your-own-ax showdown at the Overlook.\n\nMcGregor doesn't always get props, but he's a sneakily good actor, and he's great portraying the \"Shining\" trauma made real in Dan's grownup existence. There's a reluctant heroism, too, that blends well with Curran, a star in the making, as Dan becomes her psychic Obi-Wan of sorts, the guiding parental figure he lacked as a child. .\n\nRose the Hat (Rebecca Ferguson) consumes the psychic essences of children to stay immortal in \"Doctor Sleep.\" (Photo: JESSICA MIGLIO)\n\nOn the darker side, Ferguson is all vicious excellence as Rose, the freakiest weirdo in a hat since Mister Babadook. King's rogues gallery is deep, and in a year when Pennywise again got most of the headlines, Rose more than holds her own with a tempting menace and a surprising maternal streak.\n\nFlanagan's shown a knack for creating a sublimely sinister atmosphere in \"Oculus,\" \"Hush\" and especially his Netflix show \"The Haunting of Hill House.\" And he does so here with the child-hunting shenanigans of the True Knot that lean emotionally brutal, and his recreation of Kubrick's \"Shining\" landscape, with the overhead spots and camera, pans over water set to the chilling \"Dies Irae\" melody.\n\nAbra Stone (Kyliegh Curran), a girl with psychic abilities, has a hair-raising journey that leads to the snowy maze of the Overlook Hotel in \"Doctor Sleep.\" (Photo: WARNER BROS. PICTURES)\n\nWhile the Dan/Abra vs. True Knot adventure is a smidge more effective than the shades of horrors past, it's still a hoot to see those eerie Grady twins back in the Overlook hallway, the river of blood again flowing out of elevators plus one scene that will have King fans' jaws fully on the floor.\n\nIt's nothing to go channeling your inner Jack Nicholson and chopping through doors. But Flanagan's \"Doctor Sleep\" respects both King's and Kubrick's visions while letting a rising horror master go his own way, too.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/30/doctor-sleep-review-stephen-king-sequel-the-shining/2496818001/", "description": "As a grownup Danny Torrance, Ewan McGregor fights psychic vampires and returns to the Overlook in Stephen King's 'The Shining' sequel 'Doctor Sleep.'", "authors": ["Brian Truitt", "Published P.M.
