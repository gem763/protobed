When she found a job listing on Craigslist for a Spanish-speaking paralegal, she applied immediately. She landed an interview, where she was told the firm needed someone to communicate with a client in a big upcoming case. Once Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 got the job, she finally asked who the defendant was.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve heard that name?\u201d she remembers thinking when the hiring attorney told her whom the firm would be representing. \u201cThen I googled who this person was and I\u2019m like, Holy shit!\u201d\n\nThe name she\u2019d googled was Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n Loera, the infamous leader of the Sinaloa cartel. Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 would go on to join El Chapo\u2019s trial team as an attorney and impress his seasoned defense attorneys so much that one of them hired her to join Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s defense team before the convicted sex offender committed suicide.\n\nAt 26 years old, Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 can say that her first clients were two of the most high profile federal defendants of this century.\n\nSitting in a coffee shop off the lobby of the Tillary Hotel in downtown Brooklyn last week, Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 had come straight from the federal courthouse a few blocks away after meeting with the family of a new client. \u201cIt\u2019s a small conspiracy,\u201d she tells me sheepishly. A federal case built on 30 kilos of cocaine is a trifle when you\u2019re used to El Chapo\u2019s $13-billion enterprise.\n\nJust shy of five feet tall, Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 is even shorter than Guzm\u00e1n, whose nickname translates to \u201cShorty.\u201d She grew up in Puerto Rico and studied music business at Loyola University New Orleans. She enrolled in law school in Puerto Rico and transferred to Hofstra after her first year. She has a stud in her nose and sings in the choir at Hillsong, the cool kids\u2019 church that counts Justin Bieber, Chris Pratt, and Kevin Durant among its congregants. Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 is genial and enthusiastic and, more than anything, she is madly loyal to her clients. When I pointed out just how reviled Guzm\u00e1n and Epstein are, Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 chuckled. Her response was the closest she came to saying a bad word about either of them. \u201cWe are all sinners,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of us are sinners that happened to break the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was particularly good at building relationships with her clients and being accessible to them,\u201d said Elizabeth M. Nevins, a professor at Hofstra\u2019s Maurice A. Deane School of Law and the attorney-in-charge of the school\u2019s criminal justice clinic. \u201cHer ability to build relationships even extended to adverse witnesses.\u201d Nevins recalled a time when Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 got a call from a complaining witness and proceeded to get the witness talking while she recorded the conversation. \u201cIt was basic investigative work, but it was also thinking on the fly in a way that would really advance her client\u2019s case. She\u2019s fearless.\u201d\n\nThe first time Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 went to meet Guzm\u00e1n at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown Manhattan, she was supposed to go with the attorney who had hired her. But the attorney left her wallet on the subway and, without ID, wasn\u2019t allowed to enter the MCC, leaving Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 to go on alone. Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 went into a jail holding some of the most notorious defendants in the country, and introduced herself to the man in charge of a multibillion-dollar drug cartel responsible for untold murders \u2014 33 of which federal prosecutors had pinned directly on him.\n\nCol\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 said she sat down across from El Chapo and said hello. El Chapo responded by putting his hand against the glass between them. She reciprocated to form a kind of maximum-security handshake. Over the next three hours, Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 and Guzm\u00e1n chatted about their backgrounds, politics (he asked her about President Trump and Mayor de Blasio), and the upcoming elections in Mexico.\n\n\u201cHe is a very likable person,\u201d Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 said. \u201cIt was like a click. This is meant to be my job. I felt very comfortable.\u201d\n\nAt first, Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 saw Guzm\u00e1n three to four times a week. Soon, she began visiting the MCC six or seven days a week. She walked him through every piece of discovery and his attorneys\u2019 plans for opening statements, cross-examination, and summation. When Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 was admitted to the bar in September 2018, Guzm\u00e1n asked her if she would join his defense team as a trial attorney. Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 had a job lined up at the Legal Aid Society, but she didn\u2019t want to abandon a client with whom she\u2019d become very close. She accepted El Chapo\u2019s offer.\n\nAs a junior attorney on the team, Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 filed creative motions making arguments that had a strategic impact on the case \u2014 but it was her ability to put El Chapo at ease that most impressed the all-star team of defense attorneys Guzm\u00e1n had assembled for himself.\n\n\u201cChapo, not being American and familiar with our justice system, didn\u2019t trust everyone who worked on the case,\u201d said Jeffrey Lichtman, one of Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s attorneys who is best known for winning an acquittal for John Gotti Jr. in 2005. \u201cBut he always trusted her.\u201d\n\nCol\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 saw the effect her visits had on El Chapo, who was kept in solitary confinement and was forbidden to speak with his wife. Aside from one hour of television a day, Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3\u2019s meetings with El Chapo were his only substantial interaction with the outside world.\n\n\u201cMCC is a very inhumane place, especially if you\u2019re in the solitary housing unit,\u201d Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 said. \u201cIt is not a sanitary place. You can see rats walking around. It is nasty. Other clients have told me there\u2019s mold on the water faucets, the AC is never clean. You can actually see the dust and mold.\u201d\n\nEl Chapo wasn\u2019t allowed any outdoor exercise time, likely on account of his two successful escapes from prison in Mexico. When Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 filed a request to allow him to exercise outside, the government responded by citing a 1981 escape attempt in which an inmate\u2019s accomplices hijacked a tourist helicopter and tried to break him out of the MCC prison yard. The fact that the escape attempt was unsuccessful didn\u2019t seem to play into the judge\u2019s decision, as he denied Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3\u2019s request.\n\n\u201cMr. Guzm\u00e1n is strong minded,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not strong minded, it is definitely going to ruin you psychologically. It is torture.\u201d\n\nOne night in July, El Chapo got a new neighbor. After Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport, he was put in a cell three doors down from El Chapo at the MCC \u2014 though that arrangement only lasted one night. Not long after Epstein\u2019s arrest, Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 was brought onto his legal team by Marc Fernich, another of Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s attorneys who took on the Epstein case.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t scare,\u201d said Fernich. \u201cShe\u2019s not intimidated by grisly accusations against clients. She deals with them as human beings.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 was visiting Epstein at the MCC regularly. She wouldn\u2019t talk about the specifics of her interactions with Epstein except to say that, like El Chapo, she saw him as innocent until proven guilty. \u201cI don\u2019t think that he\u2019s the monster that the press made him out to be, at all.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fernich, Guzm\u00e1n insisted Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 work on his appeal. Last week, Fernich and Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 visited him at the supermax prison ADX in Florence, Colorado, known as the \u201cAlcatraz of the Rockies.\u201d She said that El Chapo isn\u2019t adjusting well to life in a supermax. Though he now gets outdoor exercise time, he gets even fewer visits. \u201cI noticed he was sad. Completely different. His demeanor, his eyes. Even his hair \u2014 they shaved his head. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve been convicted of the most heinous crimes or horrible crimes, I don\u2019t think that anybody deserves to be treated that way.\u201d\n\nIn addition to working on Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s appeal, Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 is helping El Chapo\u2019s wife with her fashion line, \u201cEl Chapo Guzm\u00e1n: JGL,\u201d which will feature hoodies, T-shirts, and glow-in-the-dark cell phone cases emblazoned with Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s signature.\n\nThree days before Epstein committed suicide, Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 visited him at the MCC and served as a witness to his will. When Bloomberg reported on the will, including Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3\u2019s signature, people began sending her Facebook messages and leaving voicemails. She\u2019d gotten similar messages throughout El Chapo\u2019s trial. They always seemed to end up asking the same question: \u201cHow do you sleep at night?\u201d\n\n\u201cI sleep with a clear conscience,\u201d she told me. \u201cIf you have a moral dilemma with that, then this profession is not for you. It\u2019s easy to lose that human perspective in this profession. You think that detaching makes it easier to do your job, but it makes it harder for your client. You can\u2019t ever lose that perspective, that empathy, that caring for them. I don\u2019t ever want to lose it. I think that\u2019s what distinguishes me.\u201d", "description": "Mariel Col\u00f3n Mir\u00f3 was just out of law school and answered an ad on Craigslist.
