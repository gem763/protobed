My name is Dan Wiener, and I\u2019d like a minute of your time to show you how to build wealth, the most effective way I know how.\n\nIt also requires very little action. Zero, in fact.\n\nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong:\n\nI\u2019m not some \u201cpassive income\u201d guru, who\u2019ll end up trying to get you to turn your spare room or vacation home into an AirBnB. Nor will I tell you to start a \u201cside hustle.\u201d\n\nThis is about investing.\n\nBut it\u2019s NOT about investing in a short-sighted way. Like most people do.\n\nThey think that, because the \u201cstory\u201d of a stock is just so compelling, it\u2019ll make you gobs of money without risk.\n\nLet\u2019s get one thing straight:\n\nAnything you do (or don\u2019t do) with your money is a risk.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the risk of facing the future without developing and growing your \u201cnest egg.\u201d And then, there\u2019s the risk of the market itself.\n\nSmart investing is about mitigating risk. To do so, you need to think big-picture.\n\nI\u2019ll show you how to \u201cset up your cards\u201d right from the beginning \u2014 do nothing \u2014 and turn $3,000 a year into more than $200,000 \u2026 and more \u2026 and more.\n\nIt\u2019s the method I use myself. I even did it for my kids.\n\nThanks to me matching my teenagers\u2019 summer earnings, putting it in Roth IRAs, and investing it on their behalf, my son and daughter \u2014 now in their 30s \u2014 have already built up a tidy sum that will continue to grow for many years to come.\n\nHere\u2019s the kind of payoff you could get:\n\nThat\u2019s more than a 50% return. For, again, zero effort.\n\nBut it gets better: If you can keep contributing for another 15 years, you\u2019d more than double your money. You\u2019d have $209,282.\n\nHeck, maybe you didn\u2019t contribute for nearly that long. Maybe you just contributed for the first 10 years \u2014 then stopped \u2026 and let it ride.\n\nAt year 15, you\u2019d still have $50,567.\n\nAt year 30, you\u2019d have $105,125.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what you are able to do \u2026\n\nIf you simply earn a 5% return each year \u2026 but you can do so much more!\n\nYou can do even better (and your portfolio can grow even faster) if you play your cards right, as I\u2019ll show you.\n\nThe longer it rides, the more wealth gets built for you \u2026 your kids \u2026 your grandkids \u2026 or even just a nice young person you want to make very rich.\n\nThe trick, of course, is making that steady 5%!\n\nPeople might think an index fund is the \u201csafe bet\u201d here.\n\nOr, at least, they DID \u2026\n\n\u2026 until their index fund lost money in 2018. Or 2015.\n\nLet\u2019s not even talk about 2008. Or 2002 \u2026 or 1987 \u2026\n\nWell, you get the point. I (and my kids) built a nice nest egg, simply by NOT taking that shortcut.\n\nHere\u2019s \u201cthe secret\u201d \u2014 what I look for in an investment:\n\nI look at its track record, and most importantly, who was responsible for it. I\u2019m looking for good management. Actually, I\u2019m looking for the best management in the world.\n\nVery often, we simply compare performance to something like the S&P 500 \u2014 and that\u2019s all the homework we do on it.\n\nBut even the S&P itself has a \u201cbrain\u201d behind it:\n\nStory continues", "description": "Today we share with you the first in a series of essays on ways investors can build their wealth -- not by relying on any individual stock to make them a millionaire \u2026 but simply by choosing the right mutual fund investments.Dan Wiener brings more than 30 years of experience in the fund industry to his", "authors": ["Jeff Remsburg"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/F4kVR9J6cfN4AhwkmQyvkg--~B/aD0zMTE7dz0zMDI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/investorplace_417/f4eae5915cae84332ae9767861116694", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
