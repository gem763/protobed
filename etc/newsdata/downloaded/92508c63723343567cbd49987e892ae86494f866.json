But that\u2019s not the whole story. Republicans flipped just a few U.S. House seats in 2018, and two of them were in Minnesota, both largely rural districts that Democrats had held firmly for years. Republicans are counting on that shift to help them carry the state next year, which is why the leading Super PAC supporting President Trump\u2019s re-election is making a big investment in Minnesota on top of what we\u2019re seeing from his campaign and the Republican National Committee.\n\nNational Democrats and the Minnesota Democratic Farmer Labor Party (DFL) have to take the president literally and seriously when he talks about making Minnesota a priority in this campaign, and not just because we want to elect a Democratic president. The president\u2019s performance and Republican turnout will have an impact up and down the ballot, and there\u2019s a lot more at stake in Minnesota than just electoral votes. The DFL is defending a U.S. Senate seat, they\u2019re trying to pick up one or two competitive House seats while defending three others, and, with the 2020 census and redistricting right around the corner, they\u2019re fighting to defend their majority in the state House of Representatives and retake the majority in the state Senate.", "description": "", "authors": ["Matt Fuehrmeyer", "Thehill.Com Opinion Campaign"], "top_image": ""}
