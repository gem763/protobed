Your fast pace doesn\u2019t work for me. I take my time.\u2019 \u201d\n\nI was stunned by her courage and her practical insight: speeding through the material is not the path to academic mastery.\n\nIn my work as an education journalist, I often take research about learning and the brain and translate it into usable chunks of information for parents and teachers. But this fall, I took on a personal challenge. Could I teach my 8-year-old about how the brain learns? And could this knowledge help her strengthen her academic confidence and agility?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne afternoon, I wrote out 10 insights I wanted to share with her this year \u2014 and that I hope to foster through my actions and attitude for years to come.\n\nThe brain never stops growing. Brains are amazing. They are constantly growing and changing shape. Everything we do affects our brain. And it goes beyond schoolwork. Anything that is good for a child\u2019s body is also good for their brain. When children play outside, eat healthy food, read a book, move their body, enjoy time with their friends, observe their surroundings, get a good night\u2019s sleep, play a game or figure out a puzzle, they are feeding their brain.\n\nLearning is all about brain chains. When you learn something new, you build a neural pathway \u2014 or what learning expert Barbara Oakley calls \u201cbrain chains.\u201d The more you practice a skill, the thicker the chain gets, until the task (such as solving a certain kind of math problem) becomes automatic. For example, when you first sit down to learn a song on the piano, it\u2019s slow going. You focus on every note. But after a while, you can sit down and play the piece smoothly and accurately because you have a brain chain for that song. Every new skill is hardest at the beginning \u2014 and that\u2019s when a child will be tempted to give up and say \u201cI can\u2019t do it!\u201d Encourage them to change that to, \u201cI can\u2019t do it \u2026 yet.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYou can train your brain to focus. Learning how to pay attention is one of the best habits you can build. So practice tuning out distractions while focusing on one task at a time. Adults are not always the best example of this \u2014 we like to think we can multitask and, say, text while we talk to you. But multitasking is a myth. Perhaps the best strategy for \u201cfocus training\u201d is really simple: The Pomodoro Technique . Have your child set a timer for 25 minutes and choose one activity that they will focus on for that time: reading a book, drawing a picture, building a structure, practicing piano, or working on math homework. When the timer goes off, give them a break. If 25 minutes is too much, start with 15 or 20 and build up.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to daydream. Daydreaming builds creativity , so let your mind wander sometimes. Have you ever had an awesome insight or exciting idea while you were taking a shower, taking a walk or staring out a car window? These \u201caha\u201d moments don\u2019t always happen while you are focusing. Also, mental down time helps your brain rest and make sense of what you\u2019ve learned that day.\n\nMaps, blocks and puzzles will help you learn math and science. Spatial reasoning is a fancy phrase for your brain\u2019s ability to picture objects and move them around in your mind \u2014 like remembering where all the furniture is in a room or picturing each side of a block. Those spatial skills will also help you with math and science as you get older. Building these skills can be fun. Have your child draw a map of your house, build an object with blocks, put together a puzzle or solve a maze.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nApply the picture book rule. There\u2019s a reason everyone loves picture books. They combine two things that are easy for our brains to remember: pictures and stories. Most people have a hard time memorizing a list of facts. So instead of just taking notes with words, have your child try doodling or taking \u201cpicture notes.\u201d Or ask them to tell you (or a stuffed animal) the story of how a seed grows into a tree, or try to turn what they are learning into a song with hand motions.\n\nExercise pumps up the brain. We all know that exercise is good for the heart, but neuroscientist Wendy Suzuki has called exercise the most \u201ctransformational thing you can do for your brain.\u201d When kids play at recess or ride their bike after school, they are giving their brains a \u201cbath\u201d of healthy chemicals. One burst of exercise can help them focus for up to two hours afterward, so before they dive into their work, have them go play.\n\nSleep is your mind\u2019s best friend. There\u2019s a reason you have an early bedtime. As psychologist Lisa Damour once told me, \u201cSleep is the glue that holds human beings together.\u201d We are all more cranky without enough sleep, but people also learn while they sleep. When you dream, your brain lights up with activity as it reviews what you experienced that day. It also plays back what you learned \u2014 like a video \u2014 and links it to what you already know. This makes those brain chains stronger.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBig emotions are totally normal. When kids feel scared, angry or stressed out, it just means that they are normal, growing human beings. Their brains try to keep them safe. So if their brain senses danger \u2014 and sometimes homework or a conflict with a friend can feel like danger \u2014 kids might freeze or want to run away or fight. Sometimes these emotions can get overwhelming, like a shaken-up glitter jar, and then it\u2019s hard for a child to figure out what to do. When a glitter storm hits, have them use one of their tools to settle things down: deep breaths (in through the nose, out through the mouth), time in nature, moving their body, listening to a favorite song, getting a snack, or talking it through with someone they trust. Remind them that no emotion lasts forever.\n\nHow you talk to yourself matters. Sometimes we are kinder to our friends than we are to ourselves. You would never say, \u201cYou are so stupid\u201d or \u201cYou will never be good at this\u201d to a friend, but sometimes those thoughts run through our heads. Teach kids to practice self-compassion by using phrases such as: I am still learning; Everyone makes mistakes sometimes; Some days are like this; What\u2019s one step I can take to solve this?; Who can I ask for help?; This is tough, but so am I; I\u2019m stronger than I think I am.\n\nDeborah Farmer Kris is an educator, writer, researcher and the mother of two young children.
