A copy of the translated document is now to go on public display, along with eyewitness accounts, many made public for the first time, testifying to the Nazi genocide against the Roma and Sinti in an exhibition focusing on \u201cforgotten victims\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Unpublished accounts of survivors of the Roma genocide collected in the 1950s by the Wiener Library.

The whole of the Reich has been cleansed in this murderous way,\u201d said Dr Barbara Warnock, curator of the exhibition at the Wiener Holocaust Library in London.\n\n\u201cThe language is bureaucratic and administrative, but in fact it is talking about genocide. It\u2019s just so chilling to read. It is also very striking at this stage, quite late on, his lumping together of Jews and Gypsies\u201d.\n\nUp to 500,000 Roma, of eastern and south-east Europe, and Sinti, of western and central Europe, were murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators. In Romani it is known as the Porajmos, or the devouring.\n\nThey are the \u201cforgotten victims\u201d. Their fight for official recognition of this genocide, and for restitution, lasted decades. They were not the focus of the Nuremberg war trials. Germany initially refused to recognise it as genocide, claiming Roma and Sinti were imprisoned and murdered in camps such as Auschwitz for asocial and criminal behaviour, not for racial reasons.\n\nThe evidence to the contrary is in the testimonies, forming part of the exhibition, of survivors subjected to horrific treatment and, often, enforced medical experiments.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dr Robert Ritter taking blood samples in 1938 as part of his pseudo-scientific racially based \u2018research\u2019.

An SS man, on whose farm she was a slave labourer, threatened her. \u201cI noticed very quickly that this [local SS leader] did not worry at all about the racial problem when it came to a young Gypsy girl,\u201d her witness account reads. \u201cHe started to come after me. One day, he was suddenly standing in front of me with a drawn pistol.\u201d\n\nHorvath told the SS leader\u2019s wife and was protected. Others were not so fortunate. Following her deportation to Auschwitz-Birkenau in 1943, Horvath recounted: \u201cIt was especially terrible for us that we had the SS men staring at us in our undressed state all the time. One SS squad leader in Block 8 took women whenever and wherever it suited him.\u201d She tells of the rape and murder of two Gypsy children by an SS officer in Auschwitz.\n\nHorvath died shortly after giving her testimony, aged 33. She had suffered as a slave labourer and was the victim of forced experimentation. Her sister died of starvation in Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp.\n\n\u201cHer account is unusual because there was a reluctance to speak about sexual violence, possibly to protect their families, possibly, and unfortunately, because of a sense of shame themselves,\u201d said Warnock.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Margarete Kraus (left) and Vinzenz Rose\u2019s certificate of incarceration, showing that he \u2018geflu\u0308chtet\u2019 (escaped).

She was transferred to Ravensbr\u00fcck and survived, but the Gypsy camp would be shut down on 2 August 1944, when about 3,000 remaining inmates were sent en masse to the gas chamber. Today, 2 August is the official commemoration day for the Romani genocide.\n\nOther documents relate to Vincenz Rose, a German Sinti, who endured medical experiments but managed an audacious escape from Auschwitz. He and his brother Oskar later hired a private detective to track down Dr Robert Ritter, a Nazi \u201cracial scientist\u201d and architect of the experiments Roma and Sinti were subjected to. Investigations into Ritter were later discontinued.\n\nWarnock hopes the free exhibition Forgotten Victims will highlight the nature and extent of the persecution and genocide carried out against them across Europe through the stories and photographs of those who experienced it.\n\n\u201cThey are still the forgotten victims. Many people are not really aware of the extent to which Roma and Sinti were targeted,\u201d said Warnock. \u201cAcross Europe, Roma and Sinti face such high levels of discrimination, and frequently poverty, it continues to make it harder for these events to be remembered.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Forgotten Victims: The Nazi Genocide Against the Roma and Sinti is at the Wiener Holocaust Library, London, 30 October to 11 March", "description": "Forgotten Victims exhibition in London documents fate of 500,000 Roma and Sinti", "authors": ["Caroline Davies"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a66c63d00724db29490b4cc26d66a02afd13a87/23_0_1338_803/master/1338.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=960572dc703638dac03346253a173186", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
