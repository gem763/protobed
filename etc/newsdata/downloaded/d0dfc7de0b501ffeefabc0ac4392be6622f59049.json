(Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo)\n\nI had it all planned out. On the subway ride home, I\u2019d been futzing around in the Jacquard app, assigning actions to my Levi\u2019s Trucker Jacket with Jacquard by Google. A simple double-tap to the wrist cuff as I neared my apartment, and when I walked through the door, I\u2019d strut in to \u201cTouch the Sky\u201d by Kanye West. Stupid, vain, and mildly dorky yes, but I am extra and it\u2019d have been a fun way to announce I was home to my pets and partner.\n\nLevi's Trucker Jacket with Jacquard by Google WHAT IS IT? Version 2.0 of Google's smart jacket PRICE $US200 ($296); $US250 ($370) if you want Sherpa lining. LIKE More functionality. Smaller dongle. Cute jacket. NO LIKE I still need to use my phone a lot.\n\nEditor's Note: Australian pricing and availability is yet to be confirmed, but we do know it's coming our way.\n\nThat\u2019s how it would have gone. Except when I double tapped my cuff, Google Assistant on my phone said Spotify was not installed on my Google Nest Hub. Oh. I flicked open the Jacquard app, and set it to turn my Philips Hue lights on. I walked in through the door to my unimpressed family. I was the last one home, so the lights were already on. Complete and utter fail.\n\nThat episode sort of illustrates the limitations of the second iteration of Google\u2019s smart jacket. It\u2019s a cool idea in theory, but not so seamless to use in real life.\n\nLike its predecessor, it\u2019s a stylish denim jacket with a touch-sensitive cuff that you can program to do a number of things. What\u2019s different is this time, the dongle\u2019s been replaced with a smaller tag and the jacket\u2019s abilities now include Google Assistant commands, camera control, and rideshare alerts. That\u2019s on top of the notification, navigation, and music control capabilities of the original. It\u2019s also slightly cheaper at $US200 ($296) (Around $370 if you like Sherpa lining).\n\nThe noticeably smaller tag is welcome, as is the expanded feature set and lower price. It\u2019s just that you still can\u2019t do a whole lot of things that wouldn\u2019t be easier with a phone, or even a smartwatch.\n\nFor starters, you can only assign three actions to the touch-sensitive cuff found on the left arm of the jacket. Brushing out on the cuff in a \u201cmake it rain\u201d kind of gesture could be playing and pausing your music. Whereas you might decide that brushing in on the cuff should tell you what\u2019s on your calendar for the day. A double-tap might be hearing the next direction on your way somewhere. Covering the cuff will always silence everything. That\u2019s it.\n\nThis might suffice for your daily commute, but it also might not be what you want for a day of walking around a new neighbourhood. In that instance, you\u2019d have to whip out your phone and reprogram your jacket. Maybe instead of music, brushing out is dropping a Google Map pin, and so on and so forth. So the jacket can do a lot more things than it used to. It just can\u2019t do it all at once.\n\nThis might be fine if you\u2019re patient enough to think about the best way to use the jacket every time you leave your house or experiment with what works for you over time. But even then, you\u2019ll inevitably run into roadblocks like I did trying to joke-announce my arrival home. Troubleshooting isn\u2019t hard per se, it\u2019s just annoying enough to want to quit.\n\nThe dongle is thankfully smaller. You can also see the touch-sensitive cuff. (Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo)\n\nOn top of the three actions, you can also program the tag for a number of alerts. But like the actions, you\u2019re limited to just three at a time. So if the tag vibrates and its LED light blinks blue, that might be a text from one of three programmable contacts.\n\nIf it blinks green, that might mean your rideshare (Uber and Lyft only) is nearby and you can brush in to hear the car\u2019s make, model, colour and licence plate. (Australian compatibility for this feature is not confirmed.) If it blinks pink, maybe your jacket has detected it\u2019s lost connection with your phone \u2014 meaning you\u2019ve left it at home.\n\nThis is good in theory. In practice, I sometimes didn\u2019t notice the alert vibrations. Or, I\u2019d get the notification on my phone, Apple Watch and the jacket \u2014 in that order. Not everyone has a smartwatch, but I\u2019m pretty sure at this point everyone has a smartphone.\n\nIf you\u2019re waiting for your Uber, chances are you\u2019re obsessively looking at how far away the car is on your phone. As for the \u201calways together\u201d feature, half the time my jacket disconnected from my phone because I was on the subway or for no reason at all. At a concert, the jacket kept telling me my phone was missing. It was right in my hand the entire time.\n\nThe dongle is smaller, but still sticks out. One coworker jokingly asked if I\u2019d stolen the jacket and forgotten to take off the sensor. (Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo)\n\nThe other snag is that for some of these features to work, the relevant app needs to already be running in the background. So, if you want to control Spotify, you have to make sure the Spotify and Jacquard app are both open. Same goes for the selfie feature. If you want to take selfies with your jacket (because it\u2019s the future!), your camera app needs to be open. It\u2019s mostly fine \u2014 a small hiccup \u2014 but spending a few minutes in the elevator opening and closing apps feels more trouble than it\u2019s worth sometimes.\n\nWearing the jacket everywhere for a week also translated to constantly pulling out my phone to tweak my configuration. That sort of defeats the purpose of a smart jacket that\u2019s supposed to reduce your reliance on your phone when you\u2019re out and about.\n\nTo be fair, some of these features are genuinely cool. It was nice to hear a little update about my day while I was walking to the train station, or discreetly swipe my cuff to skip to the next song. Less cool was telling my friends, \u201cHold up guys, I need to reprogram my jacket so I can tap the cuff for when we take a group selfie. Isn\u2019t that cool? Guys? Guys!\u201d It could be my friends are judgmental luddites, but I received one too many eye rolls while talking about the jacket to comfortably use the selfie feature.\n\nI took this awful selfie with my jacket. This is the f u t u r e (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nSo is it worth it to shell out close to $300 for a marginally smarter denim jacket? Eh. I mean, it\u2019s a cute denim jacket. I felt snazzy wearing it around for a week. I could also get a dumb Levi\u2019s Trucker Jacket at Myer for $90. I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about charging it ever (though in fairness, it\u2019s been a week since I first charged my Jacquard tag and I still have over 70 per cent battery). I also wouldn\u2019t have to remember to remove the tag if I needed to wash it.\n\nFor $300 - $370 I could easily shell out for say, a Samsung Galaxy Watch Active or a Fitbit Versa 2. I\u2019d basically get the exact same features, plus some added health features. The only thing I might miss out on is the selfie control, but then again, I\u2019m sure there are third-party apps for that. Or, you know, a friend with a longer arm. Maybe a timer on my smartphone camera.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I think this smart jacket is utterly useless. I\u2019ll probably still use it to control my music, take calls, and get directions while I\u2019m walking around, doing my errands. If and when I wear it. And that\u2019s the real problem with smart clothes in general \u2014 it\u2019s beholden to my vanity and fickle fashion sense. I don\u2019t want to wear a denim jacket every day.\n\nIt\u2019s a specific look and I already got a closet full of bombers, leather jackets, and dusters that already don\u2019t get worn enough. When the next Polar Vortex inevitably arrives, no number of layers or built-in music control could convince me to pick this over my hideous puffy coat. Thanks to climate change, perfect jacket weather in spring and autumn are like, two weeks out of the whole year. That means 50 weeks out of the year, this thing would be expensive moth fodder.\n\nMe, planning my failed Kanye-inspired entrance in my head. (Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo)\n\nStill, I did enjoy wearing it at a house party this weekend. It was a conversation starter even if most of my friends weren\u2019t sold on the idea. One friend said, \u201cWell, it does look cute on you\u201d and inside, I preened like a peacock. However, I am not rich. Novelty, limited functionality, and occasional compliments aren\u2019t necessarily worth $300. Then again, maybe I\u2019d have just been happier if it helped me flawlessly burst into the room to some Kanye tunes. As it is, I\u2019m still stuck relying on my phone.\n\nREADME", "description": "I had it all planned out.
