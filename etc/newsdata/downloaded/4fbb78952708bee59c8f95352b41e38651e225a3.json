They also connect them with their \"network of vendors\" like officiants and makeup artists who are not daunted by a wedding on a cliff.\n\n\"We did a sunrise elopement at Mount Rainier and the make-up artist came to the trail head and did the makeup in a U.S. Forest Service bathroom,\" said Gabi Fox.\n\nThefoxesphotography.com\n\nThe Foxes also hike with the couples to their wedding location, photograph the ceremony and then hike with them back to home base.\n\nThefoxesphotography.com\n\nDuring the hike, the Foxes say they try to carry the bulk of the equipment so the bride and groom can enjoy the hike, and not arrive sweaty. They also show couples the tricks of the trade they've learned, like using bungee cords to attach the bride and groom's garment bags to backpacks and using the water bottle holders on backpacks to store the flowers.\n\nThefoxesphotography.com\n\nThefoxesphotography.com\n\n\"We're part pack mules, part your best friends,\" said Brandon Fox, whose services with his wife run up to $10,000. \"We\u2019re spending the entire wedding days with these couples, so we\u2019re technically strangers, but we get to know them so well.\"\n\nThe couples who choose adventure elopements come from across the country but usually are outdoorsy people who have hiked before, according to the Foxes.\n\nSome couples will choose not to go it completely alone and will bring along close family members and friends for the adventure, according to Gabi Fox.\n\n\"I overheard one father of the groom tell his son, 'I feel so much more special today than if you\u2019d had a big wedding and I would have spent five minutes with you,'\" she recalled. \"When couples bring their family, it\u2019s really fun getting to know them and spending the day with them.\"\n\nAnother unique aspect of an adventure elopement is that couples can go back on their anniversaries to the exact spot where they wed, which many couples do, according to the Foxes, who quit their desk jobs in Boston five years ago to travel the country and start their photography business.\n\nThey get anniversary notes and baby announcements from past couples whose elopements they've photographed. They also recently photographed a bride who chose an adventure elopement after being a guest at one that took place in a blizzard.\n\nThe Foxes have also worked with several couples who went down the route of planning a big wedding -- even getting so far as non-refundable deposits had been paid -- before switching to the more intimate elopement option.\n\n\"We have couples tell us, 'We were stressing out. We were doing this for other people and we just decided to change plans and we\u2019re so glad we did,'\" Brandon Fox said. \"Some people tell us they really don\u2019t want to say their vows in front of a big group of people and some people want to have the biggest adventure of their lives on their big day.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s not for everyone, but for the people who want to do it, it\u2019s a pretty amazing experience,\" he said.", "description": "Brandon and Gabi Fox have photographed brides and grooms on mountaintops.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/elopement-main-ht-jt-191021_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
