They run scenarios all the time, both likely and unlikely. Much like with scouting players, teams leave no stone unturned with cap planning as well. No one thinks it will be this drastic, but better safe than sorry. https://t.co/uVLoB9MK0d \u2014 Keith Smith (@KeithSmithNBA) October 10, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nStory continues\n\nAny cap hit from this could impact teams in free agency next summer (even with what will be a down market).\n\nWith the Lakers and Nets playing their games in China this week, most observers expect this controversy to slowly die down. Business will return to normal because it\u2019s good for both sides.\n\nBut teams are going to be ready, just in case.", "description": "Likely the hit is minor if anything at all, but teams are preparing for 10 to 15 percent, just in case.", "authors": ["Kurt Helin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zPt8x3n6GCUuWzRL_fJhlw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4Ge.l9v8I4J5ABaqCARgfg--~B/aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/bdbf4e32f3cd599a219a0770e931cf3d", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
