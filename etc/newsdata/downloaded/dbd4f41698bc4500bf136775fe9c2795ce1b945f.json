This Amazon Prime original starring Orlando Bloom and Cara Delevingne has earned rave reviews, and deservingly so.\n\nIt follows the story of police inspector Philo (Bloom) and Irish-accented fairy Vignette (Delevingne) in a Victorian fantasy world filled with mythical creatures whose homeland was invaded by the empires of man.\n\nWhen Vignette finds herself in The Burgue and reunited with Philo, they rekindle a dangerous affair, despite an increasingly intolerant society. But with Philo investigating a string of gruesome murders, it's a race against time to find out who is behind the killings and stop them.\n\nBinge Series One in full now. We'd be shocked if a second series wasn't already in the works.\n\nGood Omens is an adaptation of Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman's comedic novel about a devil and an angel (played by David Tennant and Michael Sheen respectively) and their quest to stop the world ending.\n\nThe only problem is they have lost the antichrist, an 11-year-old boy unaware he's meant to bring upon the end of days. This forces the pair to embark on an adventure to find him and save the world before it's too late.\n\nExpect cameos from stars such as Frances McDormand, Benedict Cumberbatch and Jack Whitehall.\n\nThis dark comedy is a fun take on what happens when superheroes abuse their superpowers, rather than use them for good.\n\nIt's the powerless against the super powerful as The Boys embark on a heroic quest to expose the truth about The Seven and Vought - the multi billion dollar conglomerate that manages these superheroes and covers up all their dirty secrets.\n\nSimon Pegg guest stars in this comic series, which has already been renewed for a second season.\n\nThis one is so new it hasn't even hit screens yet - but you won't have to wait too long as Season One of this Amazon original airs on October 18.\n\nWith a cast full of Hollywood stars, including Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey and Andy Garcia, Modern Love is based on the weekly column of the same name published by the New York Times.\n\nFrom an unlikely friendship and an unconventional new family to a date that might not be a date, it tells eight stories about the joys and tribulations of love, each based on a real-life personal essay from the New York Times column.\n\nThe British sitcom swept the board at this year's Emmys taking home three awards, including Outstanding Comedy. It's also won a BAFTA and a host of other accolades. So if you haven't watched it yet, what are you waiting for?\n\nIt follows Fleabag (you never known her real name), played by series creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge.\n\nDealing with the death of her best friend, a dysfunctional family and running her own cafe, Fleabag is navigating her way through life as only she knows how - with hilarious and, at times, devastating consequences.\n\nThe critically-acclaimed comedy only ran for two series as Waller-Bridge wanted to go out on a high. Season Two also features the Hot Priest, played by Andrew Scott.\n\nThis award-winning Amazon Prime original stars Rachel Brosnahan as Miriam 'Midge' Maisel, a glamorous 1950s housewife who turns to stand-up comedy after the break up of her marriage.\n\nSet in New York City, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is one of Amazon's most successful shows to date, with the second series being nominated for no less than 20 Emmy Awards - the most of any comedy series.\n\nYou can catch up on Series One and Two now - but fans won't have to wait too long for the third series, which premieres on Amazon on December 6.\n\nIt's about to go into the fourth and final season, but if you haven't seen it yet there's three series of the Emmy award-winning Mr Robot to binge on Amazon.\n\nRami Malek plays Elliot Alderson, a cyber security expert turned vigilante hacker, who is recruited by 'Mr Robot' (Christian Slater) to join a group of hactivists called 'fsocoiety', which aims to destroy all debt records by encrypting the financial data of E Corp, the largest conglomerate in the world.\n\nSeason Four airs on Amazon Prime on October 6. Lead actor Malek has promised the ending will be 'very, very climatic'.\n\nJulia Roberts wowed in the first series of psychological thriller, Homecoming, in which she made her first regular appearance in a TV show as caseworker Heidi Bergman.\n\nBergman works as a counsellor in a privately run facility for war veterans. But she discovers that instead of helping soldiers, it is actually harming them.\n\nEarlier this year it was announced Roberts would not be reprising her role, but will remain on the show as an executive producer.\n\nYou can catch up on Season One on Amazon Prime now. The release date for Season Two is still to be announced, but will star Oscar-winner Chris Cooper and Janelle Monae.\n\nRob Delaney and Sharon Horgan are brilliant together in Catastrophe, which they wrote as well as star in.\n\nDelaney plays American recovering alcoholic Rob who meets Irish teacher Sharon on a trip to London. The pair have a week-long affair, which results in Sharon getting pregnant. What follows is their ups and downs as they try to make it as a couple.\n\nThe late Carrie Fisher shines as Rob's disapproving mother, in what was to be her final role on screen.\n\nThe series wrapped up in February 2019, but catch all four seasons now on Amazon Prime.\n\nVikings Season Six has been commissioned, which the show's makers say will be the last in the series.\n\nBut it is not expected to air until sometime in 2020, so that gives you plenty of time to catch up on the other five seasons now on Amazon Prime.\n\nThe series is based on the legendary Viking warrior Ragnar Lothbrock, who almost certainly existed in real life, but stories passed down about him may be based on more than one actual person.\n\nIt follows the exploits of Ragnar as he rises from a simple farmer to become King of the Viking tribes, and his quest to become Earl and raid England. Some critics say it's a better watch than Game of Thrones...\n\nBased on Diana Gabaldon's romance novels, Outlander tells the story of Claire Randall, a married combat nurse from 1945 who is mysteriously swept back in time to the year 1743.\n\nIt is here she meets Jamie Fraser, a chivalrous and romantic young Scottish warrior - and her heart is torn between two vastly different men in two irreconcilable lives.\n\nWatch all four seasons on Amazon Prime now. You can find out what else the New World has in store for Jamie and Claire when Series Five premieres on 16 February 2020.\n\nIf you're looking for a series to binge watch until Christmas, this is the show for you.\n\nThe zombie horror drama is about to draw to an end, with Season Ten hitting Amazon Prime on October 6. But catch up on the other nine seasons of The Walking Dead, which are available to watch now.\n\nIt tells the story of County Sheriff Nick Grimes (played by Andrew Lincoln) who wakes from a coma into a world terrorised by zombies.\n\nAs Grimes desperately searches for his wife and son, he leads a group of other survivors trying to stay alive under constant attacks from zombies, or 'walkers' as they are known in the series.\n\nLincoln left the show in Series Nine, so it will be interesting to see how things go on without him in the finale.\n\nIt's an oldie, but a goodie - and now every single case ever solved by Mulder and Scully is available to watch back-to-back on Amazon Prime.\n\nLongtime fans, and those who were too young or missed it the first time round, can catch up on all the conspiracy theories and weird phenomena from one of the longest-running science fiction series ever made.\n\nWatch David Duchovny (Mulder) and Gillian Anderson (Scully) in action in all 11 seasons of The X Files.
