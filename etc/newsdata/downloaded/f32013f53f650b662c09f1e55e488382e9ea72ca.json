Makeshift barricades were set up with rubbish containers as skirmishes between demonstrators and police continued, with riot police firing numerous rounds of rubber bullets.\n\nSimilar scenes were witnessed in the other main Catalan cities of Tarragona, Girona and Lleida, where dozens of people were reportedly injured.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Police clash with demonstrators in Girona.

Show Hide Despite the long sentences handed down by the supreme court on 14 October, some of the nine leaders convicted of sedition and misuse of public funds could soon be eligible to apply for \u201csemi-liberty\u201d, allowing them out of prison on a regular basis.\n\nJosep Mar\u00eda Tamarit, a professor of criminal law at the Open University of Catalonia, said that in cases where a sentence of five years or more was handed out, a court could stipulate \u201cthat half the sentence has to be served before prisoners are eligible for semi-liberty\u201d. However, the supreme court turned down prosecutors\u2019 request for such an order in the Catalan case. That means that Jordi S\u00e0nchez and Jordi Cuixart \u2013 who have now served two years in pre-trial detention \u2013 could apply to be allowed out on licence as soon as they have served a quarter of their sentences, which would be in January next year. Oriol Junqueras, who received the longest sentence \u2013 13 years \u2013 would have to wait about 15 months before applying. Those convicted can complain to Spain\u2019s constitutional court and then put their case before the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. The Spanish government has the power to issue pardons if they are requested and if the person convicted shows repentance for their crime. However, such a move would have profound political consequences. Opponents of Spain\u2019s acting prime minister, the socialist leader Pedro S\u00e1nchez, would accused him of bowing before the separatists were his government to even consider a pardon.

A major demonstration and general strike has been called for Friday.", "description": "Police and protesters clash in city centre, as well as other Catalonia towns", "authors": ["Stephen Burgen", "Carles Puigdemont"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af637b6ae2828a6a265617dc129540f926ec79ad/0_212_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=863b60b5a3da5428992af1c5834a6535", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
