The courtyard was used as a cemetery for SS soldiers.\n\nIt was from the Alexander Palace that the tsar and his family were sent into exile to Tobolsk in Siberia in August, 1917.\n\nAfterwards, the family was moved to Yekaterinburg where they were executed, along with their servants and the doctor, in July 1918.", "description": "Saint Petersburg (AFP) \u2013 Russia\u2019s Alexander Palace, the last home of Emperor Nicholas II before he and his family were executed by the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/b2e4d1_palace-was-built-in-late-18th-century-future-emperor-alexander-restored-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
