In the new animated movie \u201cAbominable,\u201d released by DreamWorks, a subsidiary of Comcast, one scene includes a map of China with a boundary line encompassing most of the South China Sea. The United States does not recognize that line; neither do the other nations that border the sea, including Vietnam, which pulled the film from theaters. ESPN, a Disney subsidiary, displayed a similar map of China \u2014 showing what is known as the \u201cnine-dash line\u201d in the South China Sea \u2014 on a recent broadcast.\n\nComcast and Disney are, of course, free to advocate for the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s position, and against the American and global consensus, in the continuing dispute over China\u2019s international boundaries. But by all appearances, the decisions were both less principled and more pernicious: The companies acquiesced in China\u2019s view of the world simply because that was the path of least resistance\u2026\n\nCompanies face particular pressure on the internet because deference to physical geography is no longer a viable standard. \u201cWhen in Rome, do as the Romans do,\u201d has lost its meaning. On the internet, one is always at home and always in Rome, too. But there is, or should be, a critical point of difference between American and Chinese internet businesses. Corporations are the creatures of a particular state, however much their executives prefer to think of their operations as multinational. American companies choose to operate under the laws of the United States and to reap the benefits of life in the United States \u2014 and they ought to be held accountable for upholding the values of the United States. American companies should feel a responsibility for maintaining the right to free expression in the internet spaces they create and operate. Otherwise, they risk becoming the enforcers of a corporate regime of global censorship that takes its marching orders from Xi Jinping.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Opinion Sunday China-Nba.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
