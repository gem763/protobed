All four congresswomen are people of colour, all four are US citizens and only congresswoman Ilhan Omar was born overseas. These comments were widely acknowledged as racist in a broad spectrum of reputable international news outlets, including the Washington Post, New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, Sky News and the Guardian.\n\nOn 17 July 2019, Dan Walker, a host on BBC Breakfast, commented that a woman had shared a similar experience of being told to \u201cgo home\u201d and that he found that remark \u201ctelling\u201d. Walker added that the person in question had never been told that by the \u201cman sitting in the Oval Office\u201d.\n\nWalker asked his co-host Naga Munchetty how she felt, inviting personal commentary.\n\nThe consequences of this decision are widespread with implications for the entire media landscape in the UK and those who work within it\n\nIn response to these remarks, Munchetty shared her own experiences of being told \u201cas a woman of colour, to go back to where I came from\u201d and added, \u201cThat was embedded in racism. Now, I\u2019m not accusing anyone of anything here, but you know what certain phrases mean.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by Walker how she felt about Trump\u2019s remarks, she replied \u201cfurious\u201d. \u201cAbsolutely furious and I can imagine lots of people in this country will be feeling absolutely furious a man in that position thinks it\u2019s OK to skirt the lines by using language like that.\u201d\n\nOn 25 September, the BBC\u2019s Editorial Complaints Unit (ECU) found Munchetty had breached the corporation\u2019s guidelines in issuing this remark.\n\nIn a clarification of its decision-making, in response to widespread public criticism \u2013 including from an unprecedented number of black British entertainment and broadcasting figures \u2013 on 26 September it said: \u201c[Munchetty] understandably feels strongly on this issue, and there was nothing wrong with her talking about her own experiences of racism. However our editorial guidelines do not allow for journalists to then give their opinions about the individual making the remarks or their motives for doing so \u2026 and it was for this reason that the complaint was partially upheld. Those judgments are for the audience to make.\u201d\n\nWe, the undersigned group of black people who work in the media and broadcasting in the UK, strongly condemn this finding and assert that it amounts to both a misunderstanding of the BBC\u2019s editorial guidelines, and a form of racially discriminatory treatment towards BAME people who work on programming.\n\nThe BBC\u2019s editorial guidelines allow for \u201cprofessional judgment, rooted in evidence\u201d, and require \u201ccultural views in other communities\u201d to be taken into account. The ECU \u2013 which we believe does not reflect the diverse cultural views in the BAME communities in the UK \u2013 has failed to acknowledge the following:\n\n\ue112 Racism is not a valid opinion on which an \u201cimpartial\u201d stance can or should be maintained;\n\n\ue112 For communities and individuals who experience racist abuse \u2013 including Munchetty \u2013 being expected to treat racist ideas as potentially valid has devastating and maybe illegal consequences for our dignity and ability to work in a professional environment, as well as being contrary to race equality and human rights legislation;\n\n\ue112 To suggest a journalist can \u201ctalk about her own experiences of racism\u201d while withholding a critique on the author of racism (in this case President Trump) has the ludicrous implication that such racism may be legitimate and should be contemplated as such\n\nWhile we stand in support of Munchetty, the consequences of this decision are widespread with implications for the entire media landscape in the UK and those who work within it. The scope of its effect is already evidenced in the unprecedented number of BAME media figures who have openly and publicly voiced their condemnation on social media.\n\nBBC staff complain over Munchetty reprimand for Trump remark Read more\n\nIn addition, we note the number of BBC journalists who have contacted us privately to express their concern at the climate of fear at the organisation, their feeling of being censored, and their apprehension at the consequences of their speaking out in support of this statement.\n\nWe demand that:\n\n1. The ECU revisits and takes seriously overturning its decision;\n\n2. BBC management issue their support for journalists and acknowledge there can be no expectation of \u201cimpartiality\u201d over expressions and experiences of racism;\n\n3. The bodies that oversee complaints about broadcasting, including the ECU and Ofcom, address their own levels of diversity and increase transparency as to how they reach their decisions, and how that process takes place in a manner reflective of the diversity of the population\n\nWe believe that, in addition to being deeply flawed, illegal and contrary to the spirit and purpose of public broadcasting, the BBC\u2019s current position will have a profound effect on future diversity within the BBC. To suggest that future BAME broadcasters will be hired at the corporation on the premise that they remain \u201cimpartial\u201d about how they feel about their experiences of racism is ludicrous. To require journalists of all ethnicities and races to endorse racism as a legitimate \u201copinion\u201d is an abrogation of responsibility of the most serious nature.\n\n\u2022 This letter is signed by Afua Hirsch, Lenny Henry, Adrian Lester, Krishnan Guru-Murthy, Gina Yashere, Hugh Woozencroft, Gillian Joseph, Michelle Matherson, Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff, Elaine Dunkley, Amal Ahmed, Charlene White, Lina-Sirine Zitout, Marverine Cole, Tsedenia Skitch, Jayson Mansaray, Rabiya Limbada, Aaron Roach Bridgeman, Holly Henry-Long, Diana Evans, Anjana Ahuja, Katrina Marshall Beharry, Yemi Bamiro, Claire Clottey, Ayshah Tull, Shaista Aziz, Patrick Younge, Jamal Osman, Catherine Baksi, Liliane Landor, Bethel Tesfaye, Girish Juneja, Daniel Henry, Eno Adeogun, Dope Black Dads, Marvyn Harrison, Warren Nettleford, Nels Abbey, Henry Bonsu, Nisha Lahiri, Jordan Jarrett Bryan, Rowena Twesigye, Alex Murray, Asif Kapadia, Claudia-Liza Armah, Antoine Allen, Symeon Brown, Lynda Smith, Ayo Akinwolere, Reya El-Salahi, Warren Haughton, Anne Alexander, Ria Chatterjee, Natalie Morris", "description": "The BBC has upheld a complaint against its Breakfast presenter.
