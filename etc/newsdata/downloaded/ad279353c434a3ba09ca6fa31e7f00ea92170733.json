Entertainment/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images)\n\nShaquille O\u2019Neal has volleyed back in his diss-track war with Portland Trail Blazers guard Damian Lillard, releasing \u201cSecond Round Knockout\u201d to tip off the week.\n\nShaq and Lillard began taking lyrical shots at each other last week, and Shaq\u2019s most recent release over Diddy\u2019s \u201cVictory\u201d is his second aimed at the current NBA star, who goes by Dame D.O.L.L.A.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\n\n\n\nShaq\u2019s burns focused on Lillard\u2019s poor postseason record, which up until last season never included anything past the second round, and that at least he has the accolades. He doesn\u2019t waste time getting to the point:\n\n\u201cThe sun gonna shine forever on my statues and retired jerseys / Imma live forever/ Better now or never / Kill Damian; my pleasure / I see you lose every day / Nobody do it better / Yeah right weak-ass bars you ain\u2019t tight / So when you spit something make sure you spit it right.\u201d\n\nAnd later:\n\n\"Talking crazy ain' gone get you nothing but smoke/ Like when we see you in the playoffs every year when you choke.\"\n\nHe also followed Lillard down the route of insinuating the other rapper is female. Lillard went after Shaq late last week with his line, \u201cYour pen kind of sketchy you should've left me/Sensitive I almost confused you with Lisa Leslie.\"\n\nShaq went further.\n\n\"First of all little boy, this ain't beef/ You just a [explicit] / talkin\u2019 while I'm hittin\u2019/ Call it a queef.\u201d \"You rap because you need to, dawg/ I do it for sport/ When you run I see the tampon string in your shorts.\"\n\nChris Paul and Rajon also got shoutouts with \"The world going to see you fall / I'm going to do you like Rondo did to Chris Paul\"\n\nStory continues\n\nShaq threw down lines first, but it was Lillard who initiated the back-and-forth when he said he was the better rapper on Joe Budden\u2019s podcast in early September. Shaq\u2019s first diss track featured a puppet delivering the performance on Instagram.\n\n\u201cTake your time to respond/ There is no hurry/ You\u2019ll never be Westbrook/ Never be Steph Curry\u201d\n\nLillard got back to him pretty quickly, releasing a response called \"Reign Reign Go Away\" days afterward. He made sure to hit on his shoes, movies and the most common diss levied at the Hall of Famer.\n\n\u201cWe both could be working at Kinkos and Kobe won you them rings, though Nursery rhyme spitting, small car sittin', Icy Hot poster boy TNT snitchin' you big man hatin', mad at my existence Had a song with Bad Boy, no Jordan to the Pistons\u201d\n\nLillard went at him again in \u201cI Rest my Case\u201d released Oct. 3, claiming Shaq isn\u2019t a rapper but rather \u201ca comedy, commentary, and actor.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "\"I see you lose every day/Nobody do it better.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Nr9pvTpK6_U_15MMex7esw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTEuMg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UClPyCQnpVgvXq0CcnQ3Yw--~B/aD0xOTk2O3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/7bf9cd10-e91e-11e9-b7fe-6382888bcdc7", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
