We do not think this operation will provide more security.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Invasion could \u2018come any night\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe region has been on edge for weeks over expected Turkish military operations across the border, which President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned Monday could \u201ccome any night without warning.\u201d\n\nIt would threaten the Kurds who dominate the SDF militia, a crucial partner in the US-led coalition that defeated the Islamic State and currently controls much of northeastern Syria.\n\nTurkey regards the SDF as a terror threat because it maintains ties to Kurdish militants inside Turkey, and it has vowed to crush them.\n\nAnkara says it wants to establish a \u201csafe zone\u201d on the Syrian side of the border where it could send back some of the 3.6 million refugees from the eight-year civil war.\n\nKurds argue that Ankara\u2019s goal is to dilute their dominance in the region with an influx of mostly Sunni Arab refugees.\n\n\u2013 IS fighters could be freed \u2013\n\nTrump said via Twitter Monday that he wanted to extricate the United States from \u201c\u201dendless and ridiculous wars.\u201d\n\nBut a Turkish attack could force the SDF to free some 10,000 Islamic State fighters captured in battle over the past two years, potentially allowing them to reconstitute the violent jihadist group.\n\nTrump declared that it would be the responsiblity of Turkey and other countries to deal with the ISIS prisoners.\n\n\u201cTurkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out, and what they want to do with the captured ISIS fighters in their \u2018neighborhood.\u2019\u201d\n\nFearing yet another chapter of bloodshed and mass displacement, the United Nations said it was \u201cpreparing for the worst\u201d.\n\nThe European Union warned that civilians would once again bear the brunt of a military assault.\n\n\u201cWe call on Turkey to avoid any initiative that would run counter to the interests of the global coalition\u201d fighting IS in Syria, the French foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\n\u2013 Minimal US pullback \u2013\n\nWashington officials minimized the pullback of troops that Trump had announced late Sunday.\n\nThe State Department official indicated that the number pulled back \u2014 out of as many as a thousand estimated in place along the border \u2014 was \u201ctwo very small detachments\u201d numbering about 25 people, who would move only a \u201cvery short distance.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want those troops to be there and thus send a signal that they are supporting the operation,\u201d the officials said.\n\n\u201cBeyond that, there\u2019s no change to our military posture in the northeast.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Trenches and tunnels \u2013\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor confirmed Monday that US forces had departed key positions in Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad, where Kurdish forces have dug trenches and tunnels to defend against attack.\n\nA US base in Ras al-Ain was empty of personnel on Monday, said an AFP photographer, who had seen troops there the night before.\n\nSDF spokesman Mustefa Bali said Washington\u2019s decision \u201cis about to ruin the trust and cooperation between the SDF and US.\u201d\n\nThe group noted it had already lost some 11,000 fighters in the fight against Islamic State.\n\n\u201cAs the Syrian Democratic Forces, we are determined to defend our land at all costs,\u201d the group said.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Prepare for war\u2019 \u2013\n\nIn Ras al-Ain on Sunday, local armed forces allied with the Kurdish administration stood behind dirt berms, monitoring the frontier.\n\nThey had covered streets in the town with large metal canopies to block the view of Turkish drones, sources there told AFP.\n\n\u201cThe prudent should prepare for war,\u201d said Mustefa Bozan, a 79-year-old shopkeeper.\n\n\u201cThe fate of the region will be the same as that of Afrin,\u201d 38-year-old Issam Daoud said, referring to a former Kurdish enclave captured by Turkish troops and Syrian rebels last year.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 US President Donald Trump warned Turkey Monday against going too far in Syria, one day after giving Ankara a green light to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/b4ac17_us-president-donald-trump-warned-turkey-far-if-it-decided-invade-northern-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
