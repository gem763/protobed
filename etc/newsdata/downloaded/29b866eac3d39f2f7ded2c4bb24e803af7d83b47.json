Now Google has banned a game about the protests, joining Apple and Blizzard in allegedly suppressing anything that might offend the Chinese government.\n\nThe game is called The Revolution of Our Times and it apparently was a game documenting the life of a Hong Kong resident as they become more involved in the events leading up to the protests as they exist today. It also had microtransactions of $0.99 and $1.99. According to the Wall Street Journal, it was removed for violating Google\u2019s rules about games concerning current events.\n\nGoogle joins the likes of Apple, which removed HKMaps.live, a crowdsourced map protesters used to track police movements. It also reportedly removed the Quartz app in China over the site\u2019s coverage of the Hong Kong protests. There\u2019s also Blizzard, currently the focal point for gamers\u2019 ire after it banned a Hearthstone esports pro from playing for expressing his support of the protests.\n\nTo be fair, the rule the game was apparently violating specifically cautions devs against \u201ccapitalizing on sensitive events, such as attempting to make money from serious ongoing conflicts or tragedies through a game.\u201d In Google\u2019s Developer Policy Center, the rules state that violations include \u201clacking sensitivity regarding the death of a real person or group of people\u201d and \u201cappearing to profit from a tragic event with no discernible benefit to the victims.\u201d\n\nWhile that sounds reasonable, the last part about \u201cbenefit to the victims\u201d might create an important distinction. According to Hong Kong Free Press, the developer \u2014 who goes only by Spinner of Yarns \u2014 pledged 80 percent of the games earnings will go to the Spark Fund, which helps cover legal help for protesters. Assuming that\u2019s true (it wasn\u2019t mentioned on the cached Play Store page we saw), it would seem to fall under the \u201cbenefit to the victims\u201d exception to that rule, wouldn\u2019t it?\n\nRegardless, the microtransactions do seem to be the problem. It\u2019d be interesting to see what happens if the game reappears\n\nRead next: Watch this AI cop car fight an AI Jeep", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2016%2F07%2FGoogle-Play.jpg&signature=d38c211dda76ce1fd39eca460ef1cc63", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
