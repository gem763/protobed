Not even close.\n\nWhat was in the heads of Braves fans at that very moment was a sense of dread that manager Brian Snitker had just made a horrible mistake, and perhaps there was good reason for that.\n\nFoltynewicz, to that point, had put together the game of his career, cruising through seven innings against the St. Louis Cardinals with just 81 pitches, while the Braves clung to a 1-0 lead in a game they absolutely needed.\n\nAnd though Snitker has done nothing but win the last two years with a very young team, he has somehow hasn't earned benefit of the doubt from Braves fans, for whom second-guessing his lineup decisions and bullpen moves is a sport unto itself.\n\nSo when fans realized Foltynewicz wasn\u2019t going back out for the eighth inning, they let Snitker know what they thought about that particular decision: They booed.\n\n\u201cIt was a boo-yay moment,\u201d Snitker said.\n\nThe yay, officially, was for Duvall crushing a 3-2 pitch from Jack Flaherty into center field, scoring two more runs that added a huge security blanket for the Braves in a 3-0 victory. It was for Atlanta evening the series at 1-1 when they could have instead gone to St. Louis down 0-2. And it was for a manager with a lower-than-it-should-be approval rating pulling all the right levers, even at times when he left himself open to criticism had it not worked out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019s tension, it\u2019s stress,\u201d Snitker said. \u201cSometimes I sit in that dugout and wonder like, 'man, we choose to do this?' It\u2019s unbelievable to me sometimes.\u201d\n\nCARDINALS: Rookie pitcher says Braves' tomahawk chop 'devalues us'\n\nWORLD SERIES PICKS: Are the Astros unbeatable?\n\nIf you were to do a Twitter search for \u201cSnitker\u201d during any Braves game, you\u2019d be led to believe he\u2019s an anti-analytics rube, a mangler of pitching matchups and someone who is generally in over his head as a major-league manager.\n\nThe basis for these claims is generally pretty thin, given that he\u2019s overseen a pretty steady progression from complete rebuild to surprise playoff team to legitimate World Series contender. But because Snitker has essentially spent his whole career in the Braves organization, managing teams at all levels of their farm system, there is nothing particularly alluring about him.\n\nWhen he was chosen in May of 2016 to become the Braves\u2019 interim manager, most people thought it would be a four-month deal and he\u2019d get replaced by someone with a more glamorous background. Instead, he\u2019s kept the job and kept the job, and everyone waiting for him to lose it has been made to look silly.\n\nBut still, pro sports isn\u2019t a safe space for coaches. And every big decision like the ones Snitker made Friday potentially has consequences.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s world everybody wants to be a manager, everybody wants to get caught up in that and we forget about the actual players who are out there performing,\u201d Braves catcher Brian McCann said. \u201cDuvall is an unbelievable bat off the bench, and when you\u2019ve got the arms in the back of your bullpen, you can flip a coin.\u201d\n\nAdam Duvall delivered a pinch-hit two-run homer in the seventh. (Photo: Dale Zanine, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nOn one hand, it would have been real easy to let Foltynewicz bat in that situation. He hadn\u2019t walked anyone, had only thrown 81 pitches and the Braves\u2019 relief pitchers had been bad in Game 1. Plus, it wasn\u2019t a situation where the odds of scoring were particularly good with two outs and veteran catcher Brian McCann out there on first.\n\nBut while #BravesTwitter was yelling and screaming either for Foltynewicz to pitch or for McCann to be replaced with a pinch runner, Snitker stuck to his playbook. He felt like McCann was too valuable to remove from the game, and he recalled that Duvall had previously hit a home run off Flaherty. So when the Braves got a runner on base, Snitker had no qualms about trying to add a run and handing the game to his bullpen.\n\n\u201cJust how (Foltynewicz) finished the seventh, you know, I\u2019m kinda like, \u2018He did his job,\u2019\u201d Snitker said. \u201cHe did exactly what we needed him to do and it was a hot day, an emotional day. Not to say you know what you\u2019re going to do day-to-day but you\u2019ve still got something going right there. If you get a single you have the top of your order rolling around. I just felt like he did exactly what we needed him to do in that game.\u201d\n\nObviously, it paid off in a big way and Foltynewicz \u2013 who isn\u2019t good at the plate, to put it mildly \u2013 had completely bought into the plan, even though he said he was physically ready to go back out there.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to get a real at-bat instead of my poor stuff,\u201d Foltynewicz said. \u201cAnd it worked out beautifully.\u201d\n\nAt least for one night, it did, which only means that the Braves go to St. Louis tied 1-1 in the best-of-five instead of down 2-0. What it doesn\u2019t mean is that Snitker\u2019s decisions will come up aces next time, or that fans will stop turning his name into a curse word on social media.\n\nBut when it really mattered to get the Braves back in this series, Snitker was right and the fans booing him were wrong.", "description": "With his starting pitcher looking unhittable, Braves manager Brian Snitker made the move to pinch-hit in the seventh inning.", "authors": ["Dan Wolken", "Published P.M.
