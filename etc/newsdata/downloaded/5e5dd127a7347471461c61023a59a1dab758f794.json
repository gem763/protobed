No Trump defender from the White House appeared on the US Sunday morning news shows, nor did any members of the congressional Republican political leadership.\n\nTrump\u2019s course of self-defense, meanwhile, appeared to be increasingly erratic. The president told House Republicans that his reportedly outgoing energy secretary, Rick Perry, was the secret Machiavelli behind a phone call Trump held with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, central to the scandal, Axios reported.\n\n\u201cNot a lot of people know this but, I didn\u2019t even want to make the call,\u201d Trump was quoted as saying. \u201cThe only reason I made the call was because Rick asked me to.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle 1 of the United States constitution gives the House of Representatives the sole power to initiate impeachment and the Senate the sole power to try impeachments of the president. A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" \u2013 although the constitution does not specify what \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d are.\n\nThe process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment. A simple majority of members need to vote in favour of impeachment for it to pass to the next stage. Democrats currently control the house, with 235 representatives.\n\nThe chief justice of the US supreme court then presides over the proceedings in the Senate, where the president is tried, with senators acting as the jury. For the president to be found guilty two-thirds of senators must vote to convict. Republicans currently control the Senate, with 53 of the 100 senators.\n\nTwo presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before there was a formal vote to impeach him.\n\nMartin Belam\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson said that Perry had urged Trump to speak with Ukraine about natural gas but not about Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, or a conspiracy theory about Ukrainian election tampering, which were the topics Trump raised on the July call.\n\n\u201cLesson to all of you Trump aides,\u201d tweeted Neera Tanden, president of the liberal Center for American Progress, \u201che\u2019s taking you all down with him so you might as well get off the boat while you can.\u201d\n\nAfter a week in which his campaign seemed to dither over Trump\u2019s constant attacks, Biden published a pugilistic op-ed in the Washington Post declaring \u201cenough is enough\u201d. \u201cYou won\u2019t destroy me, and you won\u2019t destroy my family,\u201d the piece concluded. \u201cAnd come November 2020, I intend to beat you like a drum.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, Biden criticized Trump on Twitter.\n\nIn my experience, asking a foreign government to manufacture lies about your domestic political opponent is not \u201cdone all the time.\u201d https://t.co/w8K8C17yUj \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 6, 2019\n\nNews of at least one more whistleblower with direct knowledge of Trump administration interactions with Ukraine emerged Sunday. \u201cI can confirm that my firm and my team represent multiple whistleblowers in connection to the underlying 12 August disclosure to the Intelligence Community Inspector General,\u201d tweeted Andrew Bakaj. \u201cNo further comment at this time.\u201d", "description": "Republican defenders mostly silent, with two vivid exceptions, as at least one additional whistleblower steps forward Trump\u2019s course of self-defense, meanwhile, appeared to be increasingly erratic.
