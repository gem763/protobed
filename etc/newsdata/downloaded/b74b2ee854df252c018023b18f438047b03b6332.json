Amazon told The Associated Press it does not suppress reviews based on star ratings but does use investigators and automated technology to prevent and detect inauthentic comments.\n\nAluko said the offensive reviews were \u201cclearly motivated by tribalism, bitterness and hatred\u201d and wrote in a column for The Guardian that \u201csometimes the law is the only solution.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

As a member Eni will continue to have the full support of the PFA.\u201d\n\nThe book went on sale on 29 August on Amazon.\n\n\u201cSome of what has been written about myself and my book is defamatory,\u201d Aluko said. \u201cIt is intended to put people off buying my book, and I intend to make sure they understand the consequences of such hatred.\u201d\n\nAluko capped 102 times for England and is a lawyer. She spent two years trying to convince the English Football Association to believe Mark Sampson as national team manager made offensive comments in 2014 about whether her relatives coming from Nigeria for a game were infected with Ebola.\n\nPressure from Aluko led to a new FA investigation after allegations of wrongdoing had been initially dismissed. The FA apologized to Aluko in 2017 after a review established she and a teammate had been racially discriminated against by Sampson but that the coach was not racist.\n\n\u201cAccusing someone of racism isn\u2019t something I would ever do lightly,\u201d Aluko wrote in her book. \u201cIt certainly hasn\u2019t been a pleasant experience. I\u2019m willing to bet that no one ever cried racism for fun, or for power, and yet so many people of colour don\u2019t share their experiences because they would be shouted down, in the hideous phrase, for \u2018using the race card.\u201d\u2019\n\nThe autobiography covers identity and race issues, footballing successes that have seen Aluko win league titles with Chelsea and Juventus, and her career as a lawyer.\n\n\u201cI love being a black women, I wouldn\u2019t change it,\u201d Aluko wrote. \u201cIt has always been a cause for celebration and empowerment, never a crutch or an excuse.\u201d", "description": "Eni Aluko has condemned Amazon for not removing racist reviews of her memoir posted on the online retailer\u2019s web site.
