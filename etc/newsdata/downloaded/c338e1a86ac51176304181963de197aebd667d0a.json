For the rest of the evening class attendees, it\u2019s \u00a38.\n\nAt the moment they haven\u2019t had any performances yet but future shows will feature female-only audiences.\n\nTeacher and director Maisie (left) was a ballet dancer for the Royal Acadamy of Dance (Picture: Guy Corbishley / Alamy Live News)\n\n\u2018We\u2019re passionate about child development,\u2019 explains Maisie and Sajedah to Metro.co.uk \u2018We believe that this unique approach to ballet helps the child\u2019s physical, emotional, social and cognitive development.\n\n\u2018Until now ballet has been inaccessible to many Muslims and Grace and Poise aims to cater to the Community.\n\n\u2018It also aims to provide a space to celebrate Islamic Identity and support the harmonious connection between mind body and soul.\u2019\n\nOnly a few months into their venture, the pair are delighted to see the reaction of the Muslim community.\n\nSome of their students include four-year-old Marym, Halimah aged four and Evi aged five. They dance to original poetry created by Haneen Shubib.\n\nThe syllabus is being developed by Maisie and Sajedah to enhance the learning process so ballet training is in harmony with the child\u2019s developmental stages.\n\nIt\u2019s open to girls from two to nine and upwards (Picture: Guy Corbishley / Alamy Live News)\n\n\u2018We hope to provide opportunities for ballet to exist in different contexts,\u2019 adds Maisie and Sajedah.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018To encourage more diversity, inclusivity, and accessibility and for ballet to help strengthen the development of children that have not previously had the opportunity to explore this art form.\u2019\n\nRecently Black and Asian dancers have finally got pointe shoes in their skin colour as most flats are in lighter tones. Prior to this, they\u2019d have to spend time colouring them to in match their skin.\n\nGrace & Poise aren\u2019t using the shoes at the minute but hope to as their students progress.\n\n\u2018Currently as all of our students are beginner and pointe work requires years of precise training we don\u2019t have any children on pointe yet.\n\n\u2018However, for the future it seems imperative that options are made available for students.\u2019\n\n(Picture: Guy Corbishley / Alamy Live News)\n\nIt is still early days for the company but they\u2019re hopeful it can get bigger and better.\n\n\u2018The reaction has been incredible, we are surrounded by the most supportive and loving communities who have aided us along the way,\u2019 they continued.\n\n\u2018Everyone is thrilled to have this opportunity and we have had many emotional conversations with mums telling us about the impact our classes have already had on their little ones and how they wish they had this opportunity as little girls themselves!\u2019\n\nYou can find more information on Grace and Poise on their website.\n\nMORE: Meet the Muslim women breaking boundaries in sports, comedy, dance, and modelling\n\nMORE: 18-year-old becomes first female Muslim jockey to win major race: \u2018I love proving people wrong\u2019\n\nMORE: Mixed Up: \u2018For white people, having brown babies used to represent a moral taboo\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Grace and Poise Academy in London opened up earlier this year with hopes to turn Muslim girls into little ballerinas.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_91169198_1571920816.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
