I said so at the time.\n\n'Because you can't use the threat of violence to achieve something.\n\n'And that unfortunately now has set a precedent where people from loyalism are looking at that, and they're saying \"hold on a second, he used that in that particular way, so now we're going to use that\".\n\n'That's wrong. That is not the way forward.'\n\nMs Foster said loyalist concerns about the Brexit deal were understandable.\n\n'I am not dismissing, and I want to be very clear on this, fears and concerns of the loyalist community, or indeed unionist middle class people, or anybody in unionism at the moment, because actually unionism and loyalism are all at one relation to this deal - they are rejecting it,' she said.\n\n'So instead of talking about loyalist violence in relation to that, let's deal with those fears.\n\n'And let's deal with those concerns in a way that addresses them.\n\n'And the way to do that, of course, is to try and deal with those issues around (democratic) consent and the concerns that we have around customs.'\n\nIn response to Ms Foster's remarks, a spokesman for the Taoiseach said: 'The Irish Government is a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.\n\n'Protecting peace on the island of Ireland has and always will be our overriding objective.\n\n'It should be clear to everyone that Brexit itself has disturbed the political equilibrium in Northern Ireland.\n\n'It's the main reason why the Irish Government was against it.\n\n'We have never wanted any new borders neither North-South nor in the Irish Sea.\n\n'Unfortunately, leaving the EU customs union and single market requires that checks must now happen somewhere.'", "description": "Arlene Foster, pictured, issued the warning this evening ahead of her party's annual conference where members will discuss Boris Johnson's Brexit deal which they have rejected.", "authors": ["Darren Boyle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/21/20197950-0-image-a-26_1572037187968.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
