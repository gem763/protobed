Analysts at Morgan Stanley had projected a $264 million loss for Goldman related to the private WeWork shares.\n\nFor context, in late September, the investment bank Jefferies announced a $146 million hit to earnings stemming from WeWork during its earnings report.\n\nGoldman shares fell as much as 3.5% in Tuesday trading after its third-quarter report missed analysts\u2019 earnings expectations and showed a decline in investment-banking revenue.\n\nWatch Goldman Sachs trade live here.\n\nGoldman Sachs took an $80 million hit from its investment in WeWork as the co-working giant\u2019s valuation plummeted, bank CFO Stephen Scherr said in an earnings call.\n\nThough the bank was forced to reconsider the valuation of its private WeWork shares, Goldman can still profit from its investment, Scherr said.\n\n\u201cOur carry value there is approximately $70 million, which is meaningfully higher than where our embedded cost is in that particular name,\u201d Scherr said. \u201cSo if there was further downdraft, there\u2019s still embedded profit in the name itself.\u201d\n\nThe executive called out WeWork during the call \u201cbecause it obviously got quite a bit of notoriety in the press,\u201d he added.\n\nThe write-down is smaller than some Wall Street analysts anticipated.

The bank posted a decline in investment-banking revenue and missed analysts estimates for quarterly earnings per share. Goldman\u2019s profits were dragged down by a number of poorly performing investments apart from its stake in WeWork, including bets on Uber and Tradeweb.\n\nAt the same time, WeWork bonds tumbled to record lows as the firm is reportedly eyeing a risky refinancing package from JPMorgan. Though the deal would secure cash that WeWork was previously expecting to take in from its IPO, the firm still faces murky financial prospects following its slashed valuation.\n\nGoldman Sachs traded at $205.29 per share as of 12:30 p.m. ET Tuesday, up roughly 23% year-to-date.\n\nThe investment bank has 11 \u201cbuy\u201d ratings, 12 \u201chold\u201d ratings, and two \u201csell\u201d ratings from analysts, with a consensus price target of $235.76, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nWells Fargo posts earnings miss driven by $1.6 billion expense linked to scandals\n\nCitigroup posts strong trading results amid layoffs, beats profit estimates\n\nElite law firm Irell & Manella \u2013 where partners make more than $3 million a year \u2013 is seeing turbulence and departures after merger talks with a rival firm fell apart", "description": "Business Insider - The loss fell under analysts' expectations, as Morgan Stanley had projected a $264 million hit for Goldman..
