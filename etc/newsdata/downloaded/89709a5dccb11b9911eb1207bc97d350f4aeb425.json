A popula\u00e7\u00e3o do Bronx n\u00e3o est\u00e1 a achar piada \u00e0 romaria, \u201cnunca ningu\u00e9m ligava a isto e agora...\u201d.

Our borough has more to offer than just stairs, I promise. <a href=\"https://t.co/2j6zUG6tzF\">https://t.co/2j6zUG6tzF</a> \u2014@EricDinowitz\n\nSome offered a little local history.\n\nFun fact: my grandpa used to go to those stairs from the Joker movie everyday when he lived in the Bronx and in the winter people would sled down the shit lol \u2014@bambananaz\n\nAnd some decided they'd just sit this meme out.\n\nThink I\u2019ll wait a couple years when the joker meme is irrelevant and then go get a picture at the Bronx stairs \u2014@String_B3an\n\nBut it turns out not everyone is happy about the new crush of tourists, and some are warning people to stay away.\n\n\"Please, if you're reading this and you're not from around here (or ever been to the Bronx, Yankee stadium does not count),\" writes one Twitter user, \"PLEASE DO NOT COME HERE.\"\n\nIt\u2019s really called the Joker Stairs on google now (I just searched it). <br><br>Please, if you\u2019re reading this and you\u2019re not from around here (or ever been to the Bronx, Yankee stadium does not count) PLEASE DO NOT COME HERE. <br><br>Thanks, <br>Bronx Resident <a href=\"https://t.co/s5u9gVPtyM\">pic.twitter.com/s5u9gVPtyM</a> \u2014@_cvndy\n\nOne video shows a local pelting visitors with eggs; another spoofs the camera-happy Instagram set.

Fight cultural gentrification! \u2014@YesThatMGibson\n\nWhile some still can't quite believe it's happening.\n\nNah i still cant get over these south bronx steps becoming a tourist attraction <br> <a href=\"https://t.co/4ehkB5Zh5d\">pic.twitter.com/4ehkB5Zh5d</a> \u2014@Damnsuh\n\nEven New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez weighed in, saying that the steps were famous when she was growing up \u2014 but not for the same reason.\n\n\"When I was growing up, everyone would tell us to stay away from those steps or go with a friend,\" the Bronx native told TMZ. \"The Bronx is much safer now and I'm happy to say that,\" she added, before offering a little advice.\n\n\"Listen, keep your Instagram posts outside of the Boogie Down,\" she joked, using another name for the Bronx. \"This is for us.\"\n\nIt's not the first time the Joker stair scene has generated controversy: shortly after the release of the film, commenters online expressed outrage over the use of the song Rock and Roll by convicted child molester Gary Glitter.\n\nIt's also not the first famous film staircase. Movie buffs still scale the steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which feature prominently in a training montage in the Sylvester Stallone film Rocky.\n\nAnd horror lovers regularly travel to the Georgetown neighbourhood of Washington, D.C. to find the stone steps where character Father Damien Karras dies in The Exorcist. In fact, in 2015, the steep 75-step staircase was honoured by city officials and marked with a commemorative plaque.
