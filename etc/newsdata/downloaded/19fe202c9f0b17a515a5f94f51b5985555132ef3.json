It is composed of five main parts, including a main deck decompression chamber, the living quarters; a manned diving bell; a bell handling system; a control van; and two auxiliary support equipment vans.\n\n\u201cThis effort is a culmination of more than two years of hard work and collaboration within NAVSEA,\u201d Naval Experimental Diving Unit, Saturation Detachment, Master Diver Bill Dodd said in the statement. \u201cIt allows our divers to train in a real-world environment that would not have happened if not for the detachment\u2019s technical proficiency.\u201d\n\nThe SATFADS completed a manufacturing phase in June 2010 and was relocated to NEDU in Panama City, Fla. where it was reassembled for manned testing and certification.\n\nTesting included transferring divers from the dive bell system to the ocean for a 1,000 foot saturation dive completed in 2011. Saturation diving is a technique which allows divers to avoid the deadly effects of decompression sickness and work at great depths for long periods of time.\n\nThe NEDU works on \u201cresearch, development, test and evaluation of diving, hyperbaric, life support, submersible systems and procedures,\u201d NAVSEA said in the statement.", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 The Naval Sea Systems Command has approved the Navy\u2019s only Saturation Fly Away Diving System for sustained operations up to 30", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
