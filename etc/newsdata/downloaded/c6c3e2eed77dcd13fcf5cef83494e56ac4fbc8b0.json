Can it backfire on Democrats?\n\nSEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR: We can do two things at once. That\u2019s our job. We have a constitutional duty to do this impeachment, but we also can stand up for America because this president has not been putting America in front of his own personal interests. He has not been standing up for the workers in Ohio, he\u2019s not been standing up for the farmers in Iowa. And I take this even a step further. When he made that call to the head of Ukraine, he\u2019s digging up dirt on an opponent. That\u2019s illegal conduct. That\u2019s what he was doing.\n\nHe didn\u2019t talk to him about the Russian invasion, he talked to him about that. So I\u2019m still waiting to find out from him how making that call to the head of Ukraine and trying to get him involved in interfering in our election makes America great again. I\u2019d like to hear from him how leaving the Kurds for slaughter, our allies for slaughter, where Russia then steps in to protect them, how that makes America great again. And I would like to hear from him about how coddling up to Vladimir Putin makes America great again. It doesn\u2019t make America great again. It makes Russia great again.", "description": "Amy\u00a0Klobuchar claimed during Tuesday's presidential primary debate in Westerville, Ohio, that Trump's policies \"make Russia great again.\"", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1176118851-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
