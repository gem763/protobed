As the summer draws down and fall and winter come on, you start to lose your natural tan and you want to add that color somewhere else,\" he adds.\n\nCelebrity hair colorist Rita Hazan warns if you are interested in deepening your hue on your own, be sure to tone down your color 1-2 shades to add overall warmth.\n\nShe also recommends using a hair gloss such as Rita Hazan True Color Ultimate Shine Gloss to help you achieve vibrant results.\n\nIn addition to Tricomi and Hazan, \"GMA\" consulted several other experts to get the scoop on what colors are trending right now.\n\nConsider the hues and tips below to be your go-to guide for five of the trendiest hair shades for fall.\n\nCopper Reds\n\n\"Fall is the perfect time to commit to full-blown warmth, and any red, with an orange undertone, is a classic,\" advises celebrity colorist Matt Rez.\n\nRez also explains it's perfect for anyone who doesn't want to totally commit to brand new color. \"I suggest doing a bump on their natural color to expose as much warmth as possible and then glossing with a copper or red Redken Shades EQ Gloss,\" he says. \"This will amp up the copper tones and create an unbelievable red.\"\n\nIcy Blonde\n\n\"Icy blonde inspiration comes from the delicate blondes we see on Jessica Stam and Julianne Hough,\" says celebrity colorist George Papanikolas.\n\nHe advises asking your colorist for lots of delicate baby highlights. \"The look from a distance might look solid, but up close has soft dimension.\"\n\nThis color works best if you are starting with dark blonde hair, but if your hair is deeper-toned, Papanikolas recommends to lift the base first to get a warmer end result.\n\n\"To neutralize the unwanted warmth and yellow tones, your colorist can use an ash-based toner like Matrix Color Sync Sheer Acidic toner which deposits a sheer violet over the hair,\" he says. \"You can maintain the cool look at home with a violet based shampoo like Matrix Total Results So Silver Shampoo and Matrix Total Results So Silver Triple Power Mask.\"\n\nCoral Ombr\u00e9\n\n\"This is perfect for faded redheads, or blondes who are open for a change, but this color can work with any color from medium brown to lighter starting levels,\" says Papanikolas.\n\nAdditionally, he warns if you have virgin hair to try a high lift tint such as Matrix Ultra Lift Blondes first which can lift the hair 4-5 levels without the need for bleach. Next, tone strands with Color Sync Water Color Coral.\n\nPro tip: If you are starting with darker hair that has been previously colored dark, lightener is required as color won't lift previously colored hair. Using an acid-based shampoo like Matrix Total Results Keep Me Vivid Shampoo will lock in the color and preserve the delicate coral tones as these can quickly fade with the wrong products.\n\nRich Chestnut\n\nIt's no secret that during this time of year, many people love to show off rich bright chocolate strands.\n\nWhen attempting to get a color similar to this at home, expert hair colorist and owner of Red. By Rubyredroots salon in South Orange, NJ, Barri Gibson, warns to be careful not to damage your hair using over-the-counter products. \"Choose quality every time, a little goes a long way. Shampoos and conditioners for colored hair are always a go and of course my favorite is Olaplex Hair Perfector No. 3.\"\n\nAsh Bronde\n\n\"If you love the cooler tones and don\u2019t want to commit to either side, bronde -- the perfect color in between blonde and brunette -- is the way to go,\" says Rez.\n\nPro Tip: Use a gloss such as Redken Shades EQ Gloss, as it is perfect for going from light blonde to bronde and even darker.", "description": "Check out five trending hair color for fall, according to experts who know best.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/FallHairColor_v03_KS_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
