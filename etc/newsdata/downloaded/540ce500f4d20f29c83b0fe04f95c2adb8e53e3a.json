And in this case, correlation implies causation.\n\nAll it takes is a Trump tweet hinting at imminent trade talks with China, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.20% launches into orbit, with \u201ctrade optimism\u201d underpinning the price action.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweets on trade and monetary policy are having a \u201cstatistically significant\u201d effect on U.S. Treasury prices TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.20% as well, according to JPMorgan Chase, which just introduced its \u201cVolfefe\u201d Index to quantify those effects. (\u201dVolfefe\u201d is a melding of \u201cvolatility\u201d and \u201ccovfefe,\u201d a Trumped-up word from a May 2017 tweet.)\n\nTim Mullaney: The cost of Trump keeps rising almost daily\n\nThe idea that the president\u2019s tweets can erase billions of dollars in value from the stock market in a matter of minutes got me thinking about the true cost, not just the financial cost to traders and investors, of social media.\n\nA poor substitute\n\nTo the extent that our portable devices have made it possible for us to be \u201cAlone Together,\u201d a metaphor coined by MIT psychologist Sherry Turkle and the title of her book, social media platforms were touted as a virtual gathering place, a substitute for face-to-face interaction.\n\nAs it turned out, not only is social media a poor substitute for human interaction but it is a harmful one as well.\n\nIt took some time for neurologists and psychologists to document the negative effects all of this digital togetherness is having on our brains and our lives. It has reduced our attention spans, created a nation of addicts craving the dopamine rush from feedback from followers, contributed to an increase in mental-health problems among teens, affected the way news is consumed and delivered, and even provided a support system for sick individuals contemplating terrorist acts.\n\nEconomists have been slower than psychologists and neurologists to quantify the negative effect of social media and smart phones, but available research suggests that they are depressing worker productivity.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a statistician to understand that if we fritter away an increased portion of our eight-hour workday chatting on social media, emailing with friends and texting about non-work-related matters, our output-per-hour worked has to fall. (No, smartphones aren\u2019t making us smarter.)\n\nAn obsession\n\nI confess that I\u2019ve been interested for a long time\u2014 obsessed might be a better word \u2014 in the deleterious effects of social media and smartphones that enable instant access.\n\nI first wrote about the effect in 2012 in response to a study that claimed Facebook FB, +0.31% was making people fat. Apparently the increase in self-esteem from social networking was reducing control over snack foods, according to the study.\n\nPretty soon any of the hypothesized boost to self-esteem was overpowered by the damaging effect that \u201cscreen time\u201d was having on today\u2019s youth, creating a \u201cmental-health crisis\u201d among adolescents, according to Jean M. Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University, writing in the September 2017 issue of The Atlantic.\n\n\u201cThe more time teens spend looking at screens, the more likely they are to report symptoms of depression,\u201d Twenge writes.\n\nTrump uses Twitter to conduct diplomacy, hire and fire staff, demean opponents and influence policy; at least he tries when it comes to policy. The president regularly chastises the Federal Reserve and Chair Jerome Powell for raising rates too aggressively last year and for not giving him the big reduction in interest rates he wants now to send the economy and stock market soaring \u201clike a rocket ship\u201d going into the 2020 election.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s prodding was unlikely to have influenced the Fed\u2019s decision to lower the federal funds rate on July 31 for the first time since 2008, it creates bad optics and makes it harder for the Fed to appear to be acting independently. There was even speculation that the Fed might refrain from lowering interest rates, even if that were the right policy course, to avoid any appearance of impropriety in kowtowing to the president\u2019s wishes.\n\nNot quantifiable\n\nThese costs may not be quantifiable in the same way that the Volfefe Index captures tweet-driven changes in the prices of U.S. Treasury securities. But they are costs to society \u2014 and to our system of government \u2014 just the same.\n\nRussia harnessed the power and reach of social media to try and sway voters in the 2016 presidential election. And Trump recently tweeted a satellite photo, thought to be classified, of an explosion at an Iranian space center. At some point, the cost of sharing classified information \u2014 especially as it pertains to a foreign asset \u2014 when it suits his fancy will be lost lives.\n\nThe president was an avid Twitter user before he came to the White House, and he has used social media to his advantage. Heck, who needs the daily White House briefing for the Washington press corps when you can speak directly to 64 million Twitter followers 24/7?\n\nSocial media has proven to be a poor way to communicate anything of substance, exacerbating the deterioration in social discourse. It has created discord, not cohesion, by inviting nasty back-and-forth exchanges among strangers, with all manner of bystanders chiming in.\n\nRemember when politicians actually talked to one another, in person and in private, in an attempt to reach consensus and solve problems instead of firing off 280-character one-liners for all the world to see?", "description": "Social media is a poor way to communicate anything of substance.
