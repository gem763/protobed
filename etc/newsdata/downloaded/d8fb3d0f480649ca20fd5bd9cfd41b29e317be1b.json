AMD, -0.63% to $52 from $42 on Wednesday, with the new target representing the highest listed on FactSet by $8. The target bump comes after AMD reported in-line results on Tuesday afternoon and gave a forecast that was weaker than anticipated at the midpoint. Mosesmann remains confident about the company's potential. \"AMD saw no pull-ins from 4Q to 3Q, is comfortable with CPU availability, and is seeing most of the demand at the high end of desktops and high-end of servers (48/64 core),\" he wrote. \"The setup for the company is for continued momentum into 2020 on broad based desktop and server 7-nanometer deployments, continued 12-nanometer notebook traction (7 nanometer next year), and a new game console cycle that is a bit stronger than we have been modeling.\" AMD shares are off 1.6% in Wednesday trading. They've gained 76% so far this year, as the S&P 500 SPX, -0.13% has risen 21%.", "description": "Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann increased his price target on shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. to $52 from $42 on Wednesday, with the new...", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
