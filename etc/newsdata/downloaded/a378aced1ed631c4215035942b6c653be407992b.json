Unfortunately for the youngster, he didn\u2019t have the best start in life either as he was born in a home with 37 other different breeds where he couldn\u2019t get the attention he needed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThankfully he was adopted by his now-owner Melissa Shapiro, from Massachusetts, who now uses Piglet to teach children about differences in animals.\n\nLook at that face (Picture: @pigletpuppy/Instagram)\n\nMelissa explained to People why she chose to give him a forever home: \u2018It was quite a decision to make. He is a lot of work and he is like a full-time job, taking care of a little disabled baby.\n\n\u2018But he\u2019s so cute, and we couldn\u2019t give him away at that point.\u2019\n\nNow Piglet lives comfortably with six other canine friends. But when he first arrived at the apartment, it took him some getting used to, especially as he had been born in a hoarding situation.\n\n\u2018He was so anxious, he was screaming constantly,\u2019 added Melissa. \u2018He would play, then go to sleep, but when he wasn\u2019t doing either of those, he was screaming. I couldn\u2019t leave the house the first month I had the dog here.\u2019\n\nAll grown up (Picture: @pigletpuppy/Instagram)\n\nNot only does he entertain his humans, Piglet has been doing a lot of good work.\n\nWith the help of a year three teacher, Piglet now helps to teach children about special needs pets at a school in Plainville.\n\nSpot Piglet (Picture: @pigletpuppy/Instagram)\n\nPupils even started a programme called Piglet State of Mind, encouraging themselves to think more positively. The initiative is now used in schools around the country, according to Piglet\u2019s website Pink Piglet Puppy.\n\nYou can gander through the site to see the adventures of Piglet who is quickly growing into an adult.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Adorable dog\u2019s face looks very human and people can\u2019t get enough\n\nMORE: Adorable bunny and cat are best friends and they\u2019re completely inseparable\n\nMORE: Woman reunited with her deaf dog five years after he went missing\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Piglet is the product of two dapple coloured parents who gave him a 25% chance of being born with congenital ear and eye defects", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_88802742_1570452414.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
