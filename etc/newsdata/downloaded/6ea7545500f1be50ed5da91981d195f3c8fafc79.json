We will never leave you.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe tweet was a sign of Griffin\u2019s emergence as the reporter most willing to fact-check and contradict Trump\u2019s claims about Syria to an audience accustomed to less critical coverage. Griffin\u2019s early revelation that Trump had \u201cgone off script\u201d in his fateful phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan before Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria gave many conservatives the grist to question Trump\u2019s actions. And her continued efforts to push back against Trump\u2019s assertions have thwarted the White House\u2019s efforts to portray the Turkish action against the Kurds as inevitable\u2026\n\nIn another widely shared tweet, Griffin last week accused Trump of pushing a \u201cTurkish talking point\u201d that the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) is \u201ca greater threat than ISIS.\u201d On Sunday, she posted several tweets from a call with Kurdish general Mazloum Kobani Abdi, a key U.S. partner in the fight against ISIS, who accused accused Turkey of ignoring a cease fire and continuing its \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d in northern Syria.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
