But the best known story in the English language is \u201cAladdin\u2019s Wonderful Lamp\u201d, from One Thousand and One Nights, first published in the early 18th century.\n\nAnd I know that it is too late to fight back against the tide of popular usage, but I like pointless gestures and think it would be good to see \u201cletting the genie out of the lamp\u201d just once in a while.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nGet on the buss: In an interview with Mark Strong, the actor, we said that he went to an orphanage \u2013 something I didn\u2019t know existed by the 1960s, when he was five. Apparently its residents \u201cwere bused out to local primary schools by day and brought back in the evenings\u201d.\n\nOur style is to spell it \u201cbussed\u201d, which I think is easier to read, because otherwise it looks like the past participle of \u201cbuse\u201d, which would be a strange word to use here (it\u2019s American or Caribbean dialect for \u201cabuse\u201d).\n\nThe rule is that single-syllable words double the last consonant when you add \u201c\u2013ed\u201d, such as fitted and whetted. But longer words don\u2019t, such as biased, benefited, budgeted, combated, fidgeted, focused, targeted and so on.\n\nA round-about way of saying: We reported that Kick it Out, an organisation that opposes racism in football, said it had agreed with Twitter that the company \u201cwould help with its campaigning around the issue\u201d. That form of words always suggests to me that people would be campaigning for related causes nearby, but not actually mentioning, for example, the racist abuse of players. A more direct \u201ccampaigning against the problem\u201d might be better.\n\nSyllabilisation: My campaign against unnecessary syllables continues. We used \u201cpreventative\u201d a couple of times last week, when \u201cpreventive\u201d would have been fine. There are times when extra syllables are needed. Commentating, for example, is different from commenting, because it means providing a continuous narrative such as by a broadcast commentator. But when we are talking about \u201cpreventive measures\u201d, we don\u2019t need them.\n\nWe also used \u201cutilise\u201d, \u201cutilised\u201d and \u201cutilising\u201d last week. I once suggested a line of code in our website software that would automatically remove \u201ctili\u201d from such words, leaving \u201cuse\u201d, \u201cused\u201d and \u201cusing\u201d. Sadly, the developers have more important things to do, so we need to remove these surplus syllables by hand.", "description": "In an editorial last week we said that simply revoking Article 50 would leave unfinished Brexit business and commented: \u201cThe genie, so to speak,\u00a0was let out of the bottle by David Cameron when he agreed to an in-out referendum in January 2013.\u201d", "authors": ["John Rentoul"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/13/12/magic-lamp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
