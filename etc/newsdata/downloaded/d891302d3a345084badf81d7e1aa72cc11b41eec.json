SeaWorld, the US chain of aquariums and theme parks, said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by TripAdvisor\u2019s new position \u201cthat ignores the educational value and conservation mission of professionally accredited zoos and aquariums\".\n\nDr Chris Dold, SeaWorld\u2019s chief zoological officer, told The Independent: \u201cSeaWorld believes deeply in the mission of these organisations. As a member of WAZA, certified by American Humane, and accredited by AZA, as well as numerous other certifications and accreditations from leading accrediting bodies, SeaWorld maintains the highest standards of care for all animals, including cetaceans.\n\n\u201cAnd regardless of TripAdvisor\u2019s position, SeaWorld will continue to advance education and animal conservation efforts along with our millions of supporters, professional scientists and other science based organisations around the world.\u201d\n\nTripAdvisor follows in the footsteps of Virgin Atlantic, which announced it would stop offering and promoting excursions to attractions and experiences featuring captive whales and dolphins in July this year.\n\nThe tour operator said it would prioritise more natural wildlife encounters instead, while cutting longstanding ties with SeaWorld, Discovery Cove and similar attractions.", "description": "TripAdvisor will stop selling tickets to attractions that use captive whales or dolphins, the review site has announced.\u00a0 Along with its subsidiary Viator, the brand will also sever all commercial ties with these attractions, ceasing to generate any revenue from them.
