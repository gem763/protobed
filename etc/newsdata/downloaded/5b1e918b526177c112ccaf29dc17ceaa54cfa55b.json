You used to hear, \u2018That actress is so ambitious,\u2019 like it was a dirty word.\u201d\n\nGoop has meant that her \"ambition has been unleashed,\" according to Gwyneth.\n\nShe had taken a break from acting while she focused on Goop but her husband Brad Falchuk helped Gwyneth get back in front of the camera in political comedy The Politician.\n\nBrad was apparently \"like a dog with a bone,\" when it came to getting Gwyneth back acting and he has praised her performance in the show.\n\n(Image: Zoey Grossman)\n\nHe said: \"The reaction of most people in our lives who have seen the show is, \u2018Screw you for not doing this more.\"\n\nHe did reveal that Gwyneth had some control over the script and some of her dialogue was cut so that she could fulfill her schedule.\n\nBrad admitted: \"She\u2019d show me a giant chunk of her dialogue and be like, \u2018I have a board meeting in two days. Please don\u2019t make me do this.'\u201d\n\n(Image: Zoey Grossman)\n\nThe show launched on Netflix last month and since then, those who have watched it have tried to draw similarities between Gwyneth's character, Georgia Hobart, and her real life actions.\n\nClose friend Kate Hudson dismissed this out of hand, telling the magazine: \"Anybody who thinks that someone as successful as Gwyneth has just been floating around in caftans all day is just being rude.\n\n\"I\u2019m way more like that than Gwyneth \u2014 I really do throw crystals around.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
