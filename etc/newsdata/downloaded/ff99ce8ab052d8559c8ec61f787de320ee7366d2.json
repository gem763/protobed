But growth has slowed lately as the category matures and consumers opt for sparkling and flavored waters, which are drunk in smaller quantities.\n\nU.S. bottled-water volumes rose 4% last year, down from 8.3% in 2015, according to Euromonitor. Globally, sales growth slowed to 6% from 7.2%.\n\nThe industry -- long criticized for bottling a drink readily available from the tap -- is contending with mounting concerns about plastic waste, rising costs to make and transport bottles, and fierce competition from store-branded products.\n\nThose issues are challenging Nestl\u00e9's core water brands, including Poland Spring and Pure Life, with price rises to offset higher costs further eroding volumes. While Nestl\u00e9's upscale brands such as San Pellegrino and Perrier are doing well in the U.S., the company was slow to tap the trend for sparkling, flavored water.\n\nRivals such as Coca-Cola Co. have highlighted the same shift, lauding the performance of premium sparkling brands like Topo Chico, while cautioning that Dasani is under pressure from supermarkets selling big cases of their own-brand water.\n\nNestl\u00e9 for the first nine months of the year reported a 2.2% fall in water volumes. That is a big slowdown from 2015, when volumes grew 7.2%.\n\nIn response, Nestl\u00e9 said Thursday it would restructure its water arm, changing it from a stand-alone, globally managed business with headquarters in France, to one managed locally in the company's various regions. Its waters head, Maurizio Patarnello, will leave the company after over 16 years in that unit.\n\nThe change mimics a restructuring Chief Executive Mark Schneider pushed through for Nestl\u00e9's infant-nutrition arm, where the company says results have since improved. \"The business is now at a stage where local responsiveness and competitiveness are of increasing importance,\" he said.\n\nOverall, Mr. Schneider said his aim was to de-emphasize lower-margin water brands and focus on premium, functional, carbonated and flavored ones. \"The whole notion of healthy hydration with water is as important as ever,\" he said. Nestl\u00e9 will look to divest local water businesses in some countries, he said, a shift the company began last year with a sale in Brazil.\n\nSince taking over in 2017, Mr. Schneider has focused on a handful of businesses he views as high growth. Water is one of these, along with nutrition, pet food and coffee.\n\nA company spokesman declined to comment on whether there would be job losses at Nestl\u00e9 Waters, which employs 28,000 people and generates about 60% of its sales volumes from local or regional brands. Water makes up about 8% of Nestl\u00e9's overall sales and under 5% of profit, according to Jefferies.\n\nThe news came as Nestl\u00e9 said sales in the nine months ended Sept. 30 totaled 68.37 billion Swiss francs ($68.71 billion), compared with 66.42 billion francs a year earlier. Organic growth -- which strips out the effects of currency movements, mergers and acquisitions -- was 3.7%. Nestl\u00e9 said it would return 20 billion francs to investors over the next few years, primarily through share buybacks. The company didn't release profit figures.\n\nWater sales were flat in North America and declined in Europe, where Nestl\u00e9 sold less water than it hoped over the summer.\n\nWater is a \"problem category\" for Nestl\u00e9, said Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo earlier this month. The company is losing share in still water and has been slow to respond to rapid growth in sparkling and flavored water, he said.\n\nNestl\u00e9 last year began selling sparkling, flavored water under Poland Spring, Arrowhead and other brands in the U.S. but has struggled to stand out in an increasingly crowded category. Aside from LaCroix -- the market leader in the U.S. -- Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. have rolled out sparkling-water competitors, while startups and private-label seltzer brands abound.\n\nIn Europe, Nestl\u00e9 is among a number of bottled-water makers scrambling to use more recycled plastic in their bottles. It is researching alternatives to plastic and plans to roll out machines next year that accept card payments and let customers refill bottles with filtered, flavored water.\n\nThe waters business \"has to cope with a number of sustainability issues that are becoming increasingly important,\" said Mr. Schneider.\n\nNestl\u00e9 has also invested in recycling technologies and collection programs to help it comply with new regulations. Incoming European laws will require single-use plastic bottles to contain at least 30% recycled material by 2030. Nestl\u00e9 wants its water bottles globally to be made from 35% recycled plastic by 2025.\n\nWrite to Saabira Chaudhuri at saabira.chaudhuri@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 18, 2019 02:47 ET (06:47 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
