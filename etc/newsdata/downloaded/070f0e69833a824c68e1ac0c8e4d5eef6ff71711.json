To a person, his supporters echoed his words \u2013 sometimes literally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a lot of fake news, as Donald Trump would say,\u201d said Sean Maguire, a small business owner who was was wearing a red Make America Great Again baseball cap, and carrying a large black umbrella, as he entered the rally amid a downpour. \u201cBecause it is a 100 per cent witch hunt. They have not let him be our president for the last three years. All they have tried to do is impeach him.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Among the most recent, one poll commissioned by conservative Fox News suggested 51 per cent supported removing him from office with just 40 per cent opposed. This earned a special rebuke from Mr Trump himself.\n\nAt the same time, while other data suggests independents and undecided voters may be less supportive of him, polls also show a hard core of unshifting support, no matter what he says, and no matter what anyone says about him.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

His disapproval rating is around 53 per cent.\n\n\u201cI think \u2013 though Democrats might not agree \u2013 if the situation was reversed, we\u2019d see the same with the Democratic Party,\u201d said Eric Ostermeier, a research fellow at the University of Minnesota who publishes the Smart Politics blog about politics in the state. \u201cAnd that is the by-product of the extreme polarisation that has befallen our country.\u201d\n\nHe said in a two-party system, where voters found the other option \u201ctoo abhorrent\u201d, they chose to go with their own party\u2019s candidate and \u201cdig in and dig in\u201d.\n\n\u201cGiven everything that has happened to his administration, what I think is very telling, is [his base of support] has not moved more than a few inches. Here in Minnesota it has also been pretty consistent; it was 46 when he was inaugurated, and it\u2019s 43 now. Some of his negatives have risen, but those who support him have remained relatively stable.\u201d\n\nNatalie Zeleznikar would almost certainly consider herself a hardcore supporter. The owner of an assisted living facility in Duluth in the north of the state, she was also trying to avoid the rain, as she entered the rally on Thursday afternoon.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

If you don\u2019t stand for something, you stand for nothing,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cWhether you love him or hate him, he believes in something and that\u2019s why you see everybody here today. He has a strong sense of what he believes in.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of impeachment, she said all the facts had not come out, but that \u201cpersonally no, he should not be impeached. From what I see as facts, I don\u2019t have reason to think it\u2019s impeachable\u201d.\n\nDifferent people said they admired the president for different reasons. One woman, Brenda Muth, who drove for two hours from her farm in Mason City, Iowa, said he was good for farmers and she liked the way he had confronted China on trade.\n\nDavid Larson, a business owner from Minneapolis, who was attending because his 17-year-old granddaughter wanted to, did not like Mr Trump\u2019s swagger as a reality television personality. However, since becoming president he had done \u2013 or tried to do \u2013 everything he vowed to as a candidate, he said.\n\nInside the Target Centre, home to the Minnesota Timberwolves professional basketball team, rock music pumped from the speaker. The Rolling Stones\u2019 Angie, and Prince\u2019s Purple Rain \u2013 played in defiance of the requests of the Minneapolis icon\u2019s estate. Most curious in its ability to lodge in the brain, was Lee Greenwood\u2019s 1984 hit God Bless the USA, the lyrics to which say \u201cI\u2019m proud to be an American/ Where at least I know I\u2019m free/ And I won\u2019t forget the men who died/ Who gave that right to me\u201d.\n\nMatt Erlien, who was seated with his wife, Merliza, originally from the Philippines, said he supported Mr Trump because he was opposed to abortion. He said he also supported his hardline approach to immigration.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair. A lot of people get to come here illegally and that means other people don\u2019t get to come,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a fair system, just obeying the law.\u201d\n\nTwo military veterans, Marvin Werth and Kerry Murphy, were also veterans of Donald Trump rallies. Mr Murphy had been to seven, and his friend to three. They spoke about seeing Mr Trump in religious terms, likening the experience of being surrounded by 20,000 similarly-minded people to a revivalist church gathering.\n\nDuring his raucous address, after the songs had stopped playing, and after the crowd had been warmed up by his son, Eric Trump, and vice president Mike Pence, the president launched into a blistering attack on local congresswoman Ilhan Omar, accusing her of being anti-American and antisemitic. He also borrowed from a right-wing trope to accuse her, without evidence, of marrying her brother \u2013 something she has denied.\n\n\u201cCongresswoman Omar is an American-hating socialist. How do you have such a person representing you in Minnesota,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is a disgrace to our country.\u201d\n\nHe also claimed Minneapolis had permitted too many Somali immigrants to settle there, and won loud applause when he bragged of his decision to cut the number of refugees the US accepts by 85 per cent.\n\nOther than the police officers, cleaners and people working at the fast-food outlet, the overwhelming majority of people in the venue were white, middle aged and lived in the rural areas and suburbs surrounding Minneapolis, rather than the city itself, which has long been a Democratic stronghold.\n\nMichael Adams was not any these things. A black, 55-year-old professional who lived in Minneapolis, he said he could not judge whether Mr Trump was racist. Yet he said that as a person of colour, there was nothing the president said that upset him.\n\n\u201cI do not feel that way, and he has not said anything to make me feel that way,\u201d he said. \u201cSending a strong message to the radicals around the world may [make people say] he\u2019s racist, but he\u2019s done nothing to make me feel as if he is a racist.\u201d\n\nIt was not just supporters of the president who flocked to the centre of Minneapolis. Several hundred protesters gathered to hold placards denouncing Mr Trump and blowing on whistles to symbolise the whistleblower complaint.\n\nAmong the demonstrators heading home on the train was Khadija Isee, a 25-year woman who had come to the country from Somalia. She had heard what Mr Trump had said about her community and she was upset.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a grown man, but he\u2019s not grown up in the head,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody is a refugee from somewhere. He came from Europe. I came afterwards. Two years later, he will be gone.\u201d", "description": "It was Donald Trump\u2019s first rally since Democrats launched an impeachment investigation \u2013 the first since he was accused of asking a foreign leader\u00a0to dig up dirt on a rival.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/11/18/trump-supporters.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
