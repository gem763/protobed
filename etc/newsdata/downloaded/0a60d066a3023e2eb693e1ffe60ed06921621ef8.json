The Banksy works that are removed from their place of birth and sold for hundreds of thousands, for instance, or the murals on the West Bank wall.\n\nWhat I\u2019m infatuated with is the more discreet, local graffiti; spontaneous doodles found in unexpected places. The messages that can make visits to the loo a reading experience almost as pleasurable as sitting in a library scouring quirky book annotations: a scrawled observation that the design of a coat hook resembles a drunk octopus; the hidden confession of unrequited love; the country\u2019s legislature taken to task via marker pen.\n\nEven better are the dialogues. I have seen, on more than one occasion, questions posed about relationships that have been answered in separate handwriting: \u201cDump him!\u201d, \u201cGirl, you deserve better\u201d. I love inspiring quotes, too \u2013 the sort that if posted to Instagram might cause me to eye-roll, but somehow, etched against the grain of a stall, speak to me.\n\nA few weeks ago, on a weekend in which temperatures hit 29C, I saw a sign that had been changed from: \u201cThis road will be closed for temporary roadworks\u201d to \u201cfor a temporary beach\u201d. The idea made me smile. A road round the corner had been pedestrianised a couple of years back, while a bridge was being repaired, and it had naturally morphed from a rat-run into a space for neighbourly parties and kids\u2019 play. The metal street sign peeling off a wall daubed with \u201cfix me\u201d also has a community spirit.\n\nI enjoy spotting recurring graffiti. Far and wide across London, the words \u201cNat has herpes\u201d are scribbled on various surfaces, from bus stops to subways. Nobody knows who Nat is, or whether she really does suffer from such a malady. It\u2019s been mooted that one person could not have been responsible for all instances, and that it has become a copycat situation. The phrase never has the tinge of a sexist slur, rather the air of a friend taking the piss. Now it has been elevated to part of the urban fabric.\n\nIn praise of window seats | Hannah Jane Parkinson Read more\n\nThe corporate commissioned graffiti represents the worst of street art. But the witticisms, heartfelt sentences and subversive acts from fellow humans are a boon. My favourite from the past week? The person who had added in the female actors\u2019 names on a film poster, when only the men in the image had billing.
