Financial advisers say people without a budget and savings are often less equipped to handle financial emergencies in their own lives.\n\n\u201cEvery household that doesn\u2019t have sufficient savings will be living on the edge when a recession arises, and in a sense, they\u2019re living on the edge even before a recession arises,\u201d says Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.\n\nKeeping your head above water\n\nEconomists increasingly believe the U.S. will experience a recession within the next year to year and a half.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA downturn could mean many companies will cut jobs as lenders become more reluctant to approve loans and new lines of credit. The combination could leave unprepared families scrambling to make ends meet during income interruptions.\n\nBut Hamrick points out that families who aren\u2019t financially prepared could be left struggling even in good economic times because they\u2019re not ready to handle emergencies such as an unexpected medical bill or major home repair.\n\nAmong survey respondents in the nationally representative poll, 38 percent said their top financial priority is \u201cjust staying current on living expenses or getting caught up on all the bills.\u201d Almost 3 in 10 respondents (29 percent) said their chief priority was \u201csaving more money,\u201d and 19 percent indicated they were mainly working on paying down debt from products like credit cards and student loans.\n\nBankrate conducted the survey released Wednesday via telephone by SSRS on its Omnibus survey platform. Interviews were conducted from Sept. 3-8 among a sample of 1,017 respondents.\n\n\u201cFor people who have a sense that they are current on their bills, the logical next step would be to save more money,\u201d Hamrick says. \u201cSome individuals are spending more money on things than they ought to be. Other individuals are essentially trapped because their incomes aren\u2019t higher or their living expenses are high.\u201d\n\nDifficulty of saving at lower incomes\n\nThe percentage of people who say their top priority is saving money steadily increases as income brackets go up. For example, 19 percent of people who make less than $30,000 say their top priority is saving, while 39 percent of those who make $75,000 or more say the same.\n\n\u201cThose with really low incomes or really limited resources don\u2019t have many options,\u201d says Sara Croymans, an educator specializing in family resiliency with University of Minnesota Extension.\n\nShe suggests those who need help creating a budget or understanding how to get out of a paycheck-to-paycheck cycle seek financial assistance through an extension program in their area, their financial institution, state agencies or certified professionals.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s situation is really unique,\u201d Croymans says. \u201cWe ask them what are their priorities, what\u2019s most important to them and what they\u2019re willing to sacrifice to get what\u2019s most important.\u201d\n\nHow to increase your financial literacy\n\nMillennials who graduated during the last recession and its aftermath may be the most in need of basic financial planning help. More than half (51 percent) of adults between 23 and 38 said they were not using a budget, Bankrate\u2019s survey finds.\n\nParadoxically, millennials were also the most likely to say their top priority is saving money. Thirty-five percent of young adults were focusing on saving versus 30 percent of Generation X, 20 percent of baby boomers and 27 percent of the silent generation.\n\nAs of 2016, only 17 states required students to take a personal finance course in high school. And only 20 states required an economic class, according to the Council for Economic Education.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about the lack of economic knowledge and financial literacy putting people at a disadvantage even without a recession,\u201d says Anna Lusardi, chair professor at the George Washington University School of Business.\n\nLusardi's research shows wealth inequality between individuals can partly be explained by the different levels of financial knowledge. Knowing how to create and maintain a budget is a starting point, she said, but people need much more skills and information to successfully manage their money on a day-to-day basis and the long term.\n\nThe financial world from understanding our student loans, to taking out a mortgage to buying a home and even funding our retirement can be complex.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t teach these concepts, people have to learn them by themselves,\u201d Lusardi says. \u201cYou\u2019re at a disadvantage if you don\u2019t have this knowledge because you\u2019re making financial decisions every day.\u201d\n\nCreate a budget, live below your means and save more\n\nYou can create a budget yourself by sitting down and looking at where your money goes every month. It\u2019s best to look at about six months to a year of expenses captured by receipts, credit statements and bank accounts to get an idea of where your money is going. This process can help you see areas where you can cut back as well as plan how much money you\u2019ll need each month for necessities. It\u2019s crucial to develop a plan to live below your means rather than above them, which creates a constant cycle of borrowing and stinting on or avoiding savings.\n\nIf you are able to set some money aside, many experts suggest automatically diverting a portion of your paycheck to a high-yield savings account through direct deposits. This pool of money which will accrue over time and earn interest will serve as your emergency fund. Experts recommend you have six months to a year of your expenses set aside in this fund.\n\nMethodology\n\nThis study was conducted for Bankrate via telephone by SSRS on its Omnibus survey platform. Interviews were conducted from Sept 3-8, 2019, among a sample of 2,016 respondents. The margin of error for total respondents is +/-2.39% at the 95% confidence level. All SSRS Omnibus data are weighted to represent the target population.\n\nMORE FROM BANKRATE:", "description": "The lack of financial preparedness highlighted by the survey could spell trouble for many households, whether concerns about a global economic slowdown manifest or not.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/couple-budget-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
