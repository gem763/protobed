Wallet in the road.' The third provides the stranger's phone number and the last asks Tim to text or call to arrange the wallet's return.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nOther Twitter users loved the lengths the stranger had gone to, with one writing: \"What an absolute legend, this restores faith that there are still genuine decent people out there, I was starting to give up on it but this is awesome to see.\"\n\nPeople also replied to the post with their own similar life-affirming experiences.\n\nOne commented: \"Years ago, on a weekend in Brighton, before wife and I got married, lost my wallet on Saturday.\n\n\"Had just enough to go out that night. Went to police station Sunday. Wallet handed in by little girl. Left \u00a35 for her with police. Got a thank you note three weeks later.\"\n\nAnother replied: \"I drew money from a cash machine outside Tesco, except I forgot to take it from the machine. Called into Tesco next morning and the money had been handed in. Lovely surprise.\"\n\nMaybe we won't give up on humanity just yet.\n\nDo you have a story about being saved by a kind stranger?
