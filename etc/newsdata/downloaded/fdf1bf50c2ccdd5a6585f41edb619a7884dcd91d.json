In my 30-plus years in the markets, I have never seen anybody else as good at market timing as Trump. Let\u2019s first explore this issue with the help of a chart and then address two important questions that prudent investors ought to be asking but nobody is talking about.\n\nChart\n\nPlease click here for an annotated chart of S&P 500 ETF SPY, -0.32%.\n\nNote the following:\n\n\u2022 Broadly speaking, economic indicators can be divided into three types: leading, coincident and lagging.\n\n\u2022 Investors who are interested in getting ahead of the curve ought to pay most attention to the leading indicators. (The Arora Report\u2019s adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model puts a heavier weighting on leading economic indicators.)\n\n\u2022 In plain English, adaptive means that the model automatically changes itself with new conditions. Investors ought to consider adaptive models, not static models. Investors are often lulled into a false sense of security by using static models that performed well in the past and then get burned when such models fail to perform. Obvious examples are 2000 and 2008.\n\n\u2022 At present, the probability of a recession is increasing. There are not many things about the stock market that anyone, including me, can say with certainty. As a red flag for prudent investors, I can say with certainty that a recession is not priced into current stock prices.\n\n\u2022 The chart shows that when weaker-than-expected ISM manufacturing data were released, the stock market fell. The ISM manufacturing index is a leading indicator.\n\n\u2022 Manufacturing is only a small part of the U.S. economy. More important is ISM non-manufacturing data.\n\n\u2022 The ISM non-manufacturing data were also weaker than expected.\n\n\u2022 ISM non-manufacturing data are an important leading indicator and deserve a heavy weighting in any model.\n\n\u2022 The chart shows that long-term Arora portfolios are up to 62% protected at this time.\n\n\u2022 The chart shows the Arora signal to start a short-term trade by short-selling Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ, -0.21%. For those who could not short-sell but are aggressive, a signal was given to buy leveraged inverse ETF SQQQ, +0.65% for a short-term trade. This inverse ETF rises when the stock market falls.\n\n\u2022 Both short-term trades have been profitable.\n\n\u2022 Investors ought to consider following Arora\u2019s 18th Law of Investing and Trading: \u201cDiversifying by time frames can provide a consistent stream of profits.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The chart shows that near the lows, Trump made positive comments about a trade deal with China and invited China to investigate rival Joe Biden.\n\n\u2022 The chart shows that the market reversed and ended the day higher on Trump\u2019s comments.\n\n\u2022 In keeping with Trump\u2019s highly successful pattern of reversing the falling market to the upside at critical junctions, this time Trump\u2019s timing was impeccable, as shown on the chart.\n\n\u2022 The chart shows that there was heavy volume on the second down day but light volume on the second up day. This indicates conviction on the downside but lack of conviction on the upside. Of course, the market, in the short term, made fools of those with conviction.\n\n\u2022 The chart shows the release of the jobs report. The jobs report is a lagging indicator.\n\nAsk Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies. Have a question?

From a momentum perspective, this was the perfect spot to turn the stock market around.\n\n\u2022 The Arora Report recently wrote before the market reversal to the upside at a time when the market was falling: \u201cThe chart shows that RSI is oversold. In plain English, this means that the stock market can easily stage a big jump up even on the slightest bit of good news.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The chart shows that when Trump\u2019s comment came, the stock market was hitting the top of the support zone. From the perspective of support, this was a perfect spot to turn the stock market around.\n\n\u2022 Support zones are invaluable to investors. To learn about support zones, please see \u201cWhy you need to understand support zones in the stock market\u201d and \u201cThe most important indicator in the stock market today is support zones.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The volume in the stock market was heavy on the prior day. This indicated that there was real danger of a significant drop in the stock market.\n\n\u2022 According to algorithms at The Arora Report, short sellers were finally aggressively pushing the pedal to the downside as a number of indicators were showing more weakness to come in the stock market.\n\n\u2022 The stock market was perfectly positioned to cause a short squeeze.\n\n\u2022 In a short squeeze, short sellers feel compelled to buy to cover.\n\n\u2022 Buying by short sellers in the stock market is artificial buying.\n\n\u2022 The chart shows two different zones where short squeezes in the stock market were the major reasons for the aggressive move up in the stock market.\n\n\u2022 According to algorithms at The Arora Report, about one-third of the up move on Trump\u2019s comment was attributable to short covering of stocks.\n\nPlease see \u201cTrump talks up the stock market, but this chart tells the real story\u201d and \u201cTrump claims the stock market would be higher if he hadn\u2019t confronted China \u2014 is he right?\u201d\n\nTwo important questions\n\nHere are the two important questions that prudent investors ought to ask themselves:\n\n\u2022 Market timing is hard. History is littered with famous market timers first calling it right and then getting it wrong. How long will Trump\u2019s impressive streak continue? Of course, as the holder of the most powerful job in the world, Trump has thousands of times more power than the typical market timer.\n\nIn addition to watching stock market indices and internals, investors ought to watch the shares of Apple AAPL, +0.09%. Apple gets a big part of its sales from China. Apple\u2019s profits in the United States are vulnerable to tariffs because most of its products are imported from China. If it gets worse between the U.S. and China, the Chinese government may choose to retaliate against Apple.\n\nIn such a scenario, Apple stock could easily fall $100. Of course, nobody on Wall Street is talking about such a scenario. Investors ought to be aware that Wall Street\u2019s job is to stay in the good graces of large companies such as Apple and persuade investors to continue sending their money to Wall Street.\n\nIn addition to Apple, investors ought to carefully watch popular large-cap stocks such as Amazon AMZN, -0.20%, Facebook FB, -0.28%, Google GOOG, -0.12% GOOGL, -0.19% and Microsoft MSFT, -0.71%. Semiconductors are often leading indicators; investors ought to watch semiconductor stocks such as AMD AMD, -0.03%, Micron Technology MU, -0.74%, INTC, -0.47% and Nvidia NVDA, +1.43%.\n\nDisclosure: Subscribers to The Arora Report may have positions in the securities mentioned in this article or may take positions at any time.
