The pastors at the evangelical youth group I attended\u2014outside of school\u2014told me it\u2019s possible that dinosaurs and humans walked the Earth at the same time. We can\u2019t know for sure, they said, because carbon dating is not to be trusted.\n\nMy experience was far from unusual. While only 13 percent of teachers said they advocate creationism or intelligent design in the classroom, based on a survey of 926 public-high-school biology teachers done in 2007, the most recent data available, the majority do not explicitly advocate either creationism or evolutionary biology. This \u201ccautious 60 percent,\u201d write the Penn State political scientists Michael Berkman and Eric Plutzer in their 2011 article on the topic, \u201care neither strong advocates for evolutionary biology nor explicit endorsers of nonscientific alternatives.\u201d (Plutzer is in the process of conducting a new survey now; he told me preliminary data suggest little has changed since 2007). And there are recent examples of school administrators doubting the value of teaching evolution. In Arizona last year, three of the candidates vying for state school superintendent wanted students to be taught intelligent design, the Arizona Daily Sun reported. In 2017, a Utah school-board member nicely summed up the concept of \u201cteaching the controversy\u201d when she suggested \u201cmaybe just teaching theory and letting both sides of the argument come out\u2014whether it\u2019s intelligent design or the Darwin origin.\u201d Except that people who study evolution also tend to believe there is no scientific controversy.\n\nSome educators in this ambivalent 60 percent tend to teach evolution only as it applies to molecular biology, Plutzer said, but not the macroevolution of species. (This seems like what happened to me.) Others distance themselves from the material even as they tell students it will be on a standardized test. \u201cTheir primary concern is not offending the students or their parents by characterizing the science in a way that seems to be challenging religious faith,\u201d Plutzer told me. \u201cI think that in some cases, the teachers themselves have doubts.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, some teachers expose students to different \u201ctheories\u201d about evolution and encourage them to make up their own minds. \u201cBut does a 15-year-old student really have enough information to reject thousands of peer reviewed scientific papers?\u201d Berkman and Plutzer write in their article.\n\nSome of these teachers might even introduce evolutionary ideas such as natural selection and microevolution. But they skip the part we skipped\u2014the monkey part. The reason is perhaps unsurprising: Creationists \u201care not invested in whether evolution affects the sizes and shapes of the beaks of finches in the Gal\u00e1pagos,\u201d says Glenn Branch, the deputy director of the National Center for Science Education, which supports teaching evolution in schools. \u201cThey are worried about whether people were created in the image of God himself.\u201d", "description": "Many American students, myself included, never learn the human part of evolution.", "authors": ["Olga Khazan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTXAOFA/facebook.jpg?1568833867", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
