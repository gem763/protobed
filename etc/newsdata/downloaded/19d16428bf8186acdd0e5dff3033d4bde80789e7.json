'I'm born to have workload,' LeBron James says", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE USA TODAY Sports' Trysta Krick and Mark Medina break down the questions entering this season for the Los Angeles Lakers. USA TODAY\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 The Lakers had no need to make much of a halftime speech. Save that for the games that count. Save that for when the Lakers actually feel tested.\n\nSo well before Los Angeles' 126-93 preseason win over the Golden State Warriors at Staples Center on Wednesday, Anthony Davis could not help but laugh with LeBron James at halftime. Before finishing with eight points on 3-of-9 shooting in his Lakers debut in Los Angeles, Davis mused that those low numbers did not matter. Not when he finished with eight assists.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in a while where I can have five or six points, whatever it was, at halftime and we\u2019re up 30,\u2019\u201d Davis recalled telling James. \u201cIt feels good knowing that you don\u2019t have to do much and everybody has a role. When you have guys all over the board who can score the basketball, you don\u2019t need to do everything every possession.\u201d\n\nMake no mistake: The Lakers\u2019 success largely hinges on James and Davis. The Lakers parted ways with a significant part of their young core two years ago to pave cap space for James\u2019 eventual arrival. The Lakers sent another chunk of their young core and a handful of draft picks last summer to New Orleans for Davis.\n\nON CHINA: What LeBron James could have \u2014 and should have \u2014 said when asked\n\nMORE ON CHINA: LeBron James addresses 'tough situation' after backlash\n\nLakers forward Anthony Davis (3) and forward LeBron James (23) shown n the first half against the Warriors at Staples Center.

Davis knocked off rust from missing an exhibition with a sprained right thumb.\n\nStill, the Lakers do not want to burden their stars. And Lakers coach Frank Vogel expressed optimism that they won't. Avery Bradley, Danny Green, Quinn Cook and Jared Dudley shot a collective 10-of-16 from deep.\n\n\u201cHopefully the two of them can help each other reduce the workload,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t always have to always go through LeBron like it has with teams past, and it doesn\u2019t always have to go through AD. Quite frankly even when those guys are out, I love the role players that we have and their ability to carry the load as well.\u201d\n\nJames\u2019 eyes perked up when he heard about Vogel\u2019s hopes and how it matches with his perspective.\n\n\u201cMy perspective, personally?\u201d James repeated. \u201cIt sounds good. It sounds good.\u201d\n\nJames said those words with a hint of skepticism. It might sound good on paper. The 34-year-old is entering his 17th season after missing a combined 27 games last season because of a strained left groin. The 26-year-old Davis missed a combined 26 games last season in New Orleans because of various ailments.\n\nDoes that sound good in reality, though?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m born to have workload,\u201d James said. \u201cIt is who I am, both on and off the floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve trained my body all through the summer to be able to take contact, fall on the ground and be able to get up,\u201d James said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve just been blessed to put myself in drastic situations where I can jump up in the air, turn and fall and also get up and be able to get back on defense and get back to the timeout on the play.\u201d\n\nSo Vogel might play James and Davis as they have in recent seasons. James averaged 35.2 minutes last season, while Davis logged 33 minutes per night in New Orleans. With the two playing with a superior supporting cast this season, James and Davis could have an easier working environment.\n\n\u201cIt feels good to be able to just fit in,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWhen the ball comes your way, either score or pass it. It has kind of been like that all preseason.\u201d\n\nLeBron has done a lot in his career. But he even admitted this play in a pre-season game is one of his favorites. LeBron: \"It's up there.\" https://t.co/w3lqc3Q9Po \u2014 Mark Medina (@MarkG_Medina) October 17, 2019\n\nJames epitomized that balance when he performed a highlight-reel play that he admits is \u201cup there\u201d amid all of his other accomplishments through 16 NBA seasons.\n\nWhen Davis grabbed a rebound off a missed Warriors shot, James charged to the basket. Warriors forward Juan Toscano-Anderson disrupted James\u2019 path, and in mid-air, James twirled the ball to the left side of his head. Then he flicked a no-look pass to Green on the far corner.\n\nGreen sank the 3-pointer. As Green mused,\u201cIt was probably the most pressure I had in a long time making a shot.\u201d The play captured how the Lakers\u2019 supporting cast can make life easier for James and Davis.\n\n\u201cLeBron is going to be LeBron. AD is going to be AD, attract attention and put pressure on the rim and the paint,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to give him the space and create space for them, knock down shots and take care of the ball.\u201d\n\nAs for Davis? This has become a new phenomenon.\n\nHe tripled his assists total in New Orleans from his rookie season in 2012-13 (1.3) to 2018-19 (3.9). Davis' assist numbers might increase again this season because of who receives his passes.\n\n\u201cHe makes everybody better,\u201d Davis said of James. \u201cHe draws a lot of attention so therefore as a result we had a lot of open shots. Guys are making the right plays. It is going to be like that all year.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY NBA reporter Mark Medina on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.", "description": "As LeBron James and Anthony Davis gain chemistry on the court, Lakers coach Frank Vogel will manage their workload this year so they remain effective.", "authors": ["Mark Medina", "Published P.M.
