It was exposed in each of their past two playoff losses and nearly cost them again on Monday night.\n\nDown 27-21 on their 25-yard line with 50 seconds remaining, the Texans drove 75 yards in just 13 seconds on two Deshaun Watson passes - a 38-yarder to DeAndre Hopkins and a 37-yard scoring strike to Kenny Stills. Suddenly, New Orleans trailed 28-27.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t really good football, you know, to give up a big play against a guy (Hopkins) that we should have safety help, over-the-top coverage on, and then the very next play to give up a touchdown pass,\u201d Payton said.\n\nFortunately for New Orleans, the 37 seconds still remaining after Houston had surged in front was just enough time for Drew Brees to complete three passes for 35 yards to set up Wil Lutz\u2019 game-winning field goal from 58 yards as time expired.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t always ended well when the Saints have lost late leads. They lost a divisional-round playoff game to end their 2017 season when they gave up a 61-yard touchdown , known as the \u201cMinneapolis Miracle\u201d, as time expired.\n\nIn last season\u2019s NFC title game, the Saints led 23-20 with 1:41 left in regulation, but could not keep the Rams out of tying field-goal range. Los Angeles won in overtime.\n\nDuring the 2018 regular season, New Orleans won twice despite defensive collapses in the final minutes.\n\nAgainst Cleveland , the Saints were beaten over the top on a 46-yard scoring strike to Antonio Callaway with 1:16 left in regulation. But the Browns missed the go-ahead extra point and Brees drove New Orleans into range for a game-winning kick by Lutz.\n\nAt Baltimore, the Saints allowed the Ravens to drive 81 yards in six plays and score what looked like a game-tying TD on a 14-yard pass from Joe Flacco to John Brown with 24 seconds left in regulation. But an extremely rare missed extra point by Baltimore kicker Justin Tucker allowed New Orleans to escape with a 24-23 win .\n\nPayton emphasized that New Orleans\u2019 latest bout with late-game defensive breakdowns happened in Week 1, so there\u2019s time to make corrections.\n\nThe Saints have a little more margin for error, for now. They\u2019re already alone in first place in the NFC South because Atlanta, Carolina and Tampa Bay all lost last weekend.\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nThe offensive line, now centered by second-round draft choice Erik McCoy after the retirement of Pro Bowler Max Unger, allowed only one sack of Brees, and that was on a linebacker blitz. Right tackle Ryan Ramczyk neutralized J.J. Watt, the 2018 AFC sack leader, who did not have a tackle or any other meaningful defensive statistic. Brees\u2018 comfort with his pass blocking helped him complete 32 of 43 passes for 370 yards.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe Saints\u2019 defensive backfield too often lost track of receivers, particularly on Houston\u2019s final drive, but also on two earlier touchdown drives. At one point, Houston had a string of six straight third-down conversions.\n\nLast season, the Saints gave up 268.9 yards passing per game, which ranked 29th in the NFL. Top cornerback Marshon Lattimore spent much of Monday night\u2019s game covering Hopkins, who caught eight passes for 111 yards and two TDs, not to mention a 38-yarder down the left sideline on Houston\u2019s last drive.\n\n\u201cHe made too many plays \u2026 for one of our goals was to be to eliminate him or do not let him beat you,\u201d Payton said. \u201cThat kind of thing, we need to clean up as players and as coaches.\u201d\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nReserve defensive end Trey Hendrickson, who had eight tackles and no sacks last season, sacked Watson twice. His second sack, in which he beat left tackle Laremy Tunsil around the outside, stalled a fourth-quarter Houston drive near midfield.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nDefensive end Marcus Davenport is under increasing pressure to produce in his second season after the Saints traded up to take him in the first round in 2018. Davenport was credited with two tackles against Houston, but was not in on any of the Saints\u2019 six sacks and did not have any tackles for loss.\n\nINJURED\n\nThe Saints did not announce any injuries, but safety Marcus Williams, who intercepted Watson in the third quarter, stayed down on one knee after a play in the fourth quarter. He came to the sideline after speaking with a trainer.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n74.4 - That was the 40-year-old Brees\u2018 completion rate in the opener, matching his NFL record completion rate for all of last season.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe early schedule remains difficult, starting Sunday against the Rams in Los Angeles. The Saints plan to remain on the West Coast throughout the following week before playing at Seattle, then return home to meet Dallas.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Saints coach Sean Payton offered a compliment - albeit a backhanded one - to his club's defense for its effort to protect a six-point lead in the final 50 seconds of a thrilling season opener against Houston.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brett Martel"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/texans_saints_football_49262_c0-168-4016-2509_s1770x1032.jpg?6b10369587cd67afb43f8020a564704c286e87e3", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
