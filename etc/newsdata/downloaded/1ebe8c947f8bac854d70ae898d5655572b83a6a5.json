They do screenings to find the weakest, most easily manipulated people to do the 'haunt.'\n\n\"It's literally just a kidnapping and torture house. Some people have had to seek professional psychiatric help and medical care for extensive injuries.\n\n\"It is seriously just torture porn.\"\n\nHe is also claimed participants were waterboarded and forced to eat things.\n\n(Image: Caters News Agency)\n\nThe petition has attracted more than 57,000 signatures with some people explaining on the page why they back Frankie.\n\nSandra Seymour said: \"This 'attraction' targets susceptible and vulnerable people with the promise of a large sum of money in order to torture them.\"\n\nYvone Christy said: \"I am signing this because I watched a youtube video on this and it is definitely not a haunt it is pure torture.\"\n\nParticipants who pass the checks must watch a two-hour video that shows people taking part in previous experiences and failed.\n\n(Image: Caters News Agency)\n\nThroughout the video the phrase \"You really don't want to do this\" is repeatedly spoken.\n\nParticipants don't have to pay money but they are asked to bring food for Russ' dogs.\n\nHowever according to Frankie this is a loophole as it means participants are \"doing it for fun\".\n\nRuss told WGNTV : \"I\u2019m a very straight-laced conservative guy, but here I run this crazy haunted house that people think is this torture factory, fetish factory.\n\n(Image: Caters News Agency)\n\n\"All of these things that it\u2019s not, but people believe that based upon the films that I have made.\"\n\nHe claims he has been reported to the police a number of times which is one of the reasons why he films the experiences.\n\n\"When you have that kind of power over people... they\u2019ll go to the authorities,\" he said.\n\n\"I have to come back and show the footage and say, \u2018it didn\u2019t go that way at all.\u2019 It\u2019s saved me a thousand times.\u201d\n\n(Image: Caters News Agency)\n\nRuss says he spent more than $1million on the experience which are inspired by classic horror films including Vertigo and Psycho.\n\nA notice on its website says: \"Be warned, McKamey Manor is not your standard (boo) haunted house. This is an audience participation event in which you will live your own horror movie.\n\n\"This is a rough, intense and truly frightening experience. You must be in great health to participate .\n\n\"Anyone that has been drinking alcohol, or taking drugs will not be allowed into the haunt and will be asked to leave the property.\"\n\n(Image: Caters News Agency)\n\nThe website also says the experience is not recommended to anyone who is \"a big whimp\".\n\nMirror Online has contacted Russ for a comment.", "description": "Events held at McKamey Manor are so terrifying that participants must sign a 40-page waiver - but critics say it's a 'torture chamber in disguise'", "authors": ["Lorraine King", "Image", "Caters News Agency"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20756325.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Scariest-haunted-house.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
