You\u2019ll have to go back to London.\u201d\n\nI was 18, in Schiphol airport, Amsterdam, not boarding the second half of my flight to Delhi. My mum had suggested I visit a travel agent before booking this three-week trip to the north of India and I\u2019d balked. \u201cTravel agent? Have you heard of the internet, Mum?\u201d\n\nI\u2019d booked my flights and the hotel, and although I was dimly aware that I should get a visa, the website had a tiny script and the forms seemed difficult to navigate; I clicked away and decided it would all, somehow, just work out.\n\nOf course, it didn\u2019t, because international travel rules are international travel rules. I flew back to London that same day, got a visa the next morning from the Indian consulate, and the day after boarded a new flight. Luckily, the flight I missed had been oversubscribed, so the replacement was free: the funds I\u2019d spent months scraping together were dented but not totally depleted, and I decided this was a learning experience.\n\nThe next time it happened, I was 28 and en route to Heathrow, to fly to Miami with my then boyfriend. \u201cDid you get your Esta?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cOh, I checked and I don\u2019t need one,\u201d I blithely replied.\n\n\u201cYou do,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut... but\u2026\u201d\n\nI felt the familiar sense of dread. The admin for this holiday had been on a list that included consolidating pension plans, going to the dentist, replying to at least eight emails from my accountant (I am freelance) and sewing up a hole in the arm of my favourite jacket. These were my non-crucial-but-still\u2011quite-important to-dos (although that jacket still has a hole in it, two years later).\n\nI\u2019m sure you know the feeling. According to one 2018 survey of 2,000 Brits, the average adult carries out 109 life admin tasks a year, from sorting out car insurance to paying council tax; about half the respondents admitted they struggled to keep up with household paperwork. Life admin might be at once the most boring and overwhelming anxiety of our age: look closely, and we are procrastinating and blind panicking our way into an organisational crisis.\n\nThe little jobs that fill the gaps in our days like sand between stones have always been a problem for me. Filling in the forms to pay the bills that will keep the lights on and the phone working. Buying milk. Signing up in time to get the best deal. When I was 18, this was forgivable: I\u2019d grow out of it. Ten years later, less so. Now I\u2019m 31, and my inability to manage life admin has become a shameful character flaw. I tell myself I am too self-involved and not practical enough, immature and lazy. The more debit cards I have lost (I\u2019m on my seventh for this year alone), the more bills I have forgotten to pay, the more I have started to see myself as a defective person. \u201cI\u2019m so silly,\u201d became \u201cI\u2019m an idiot,\u201d became \u201cI just hate myself sometimes.\u201d I work for myself, I pay my rent and I don\u2019t rely on anyone else for money; I even do work that I enjoy. By some standards, I\u2019m successful. But my admin ineptitude still makes me feel I\u2019m lacking a fundamental piece of the \u201cadult\u201d jigsaw.\n\nThe US academic and journalist Anne Helen Petersen recently diagnosed people like me with \u201cerrand paralysis\u201d, a symptom of \u201cmillennial burnout\u201d. She argues that the 2008 financial crisis, the decline of the middle class and the rise of the 1%, together with the decay of stable, full-time jobs, means our mental energy is fully trained on keeping afloat: we don\u2019t have the energy left for the smaller tasks. In this scenario, I\u2019m a victim of the always-on mentality that has come to define my generation. This analysis does help to alleviate some of my shame \u2013 but it turns out that being bad at life admin isn\u2019t just a flaky millennial thing \u2013 fully fledged adults suffer, too.\n\nWhen Elizabeth Emens, a professor of law at Columbia University in New York and undeniable grownup, gave a lecture on the subject, she wondered if she might be making a huge mistake. \u201cIt was different from anything I\u2019d written, or even heard presented, before,\u201d she tells me. But as she started speaking, \u201can amazing thing happened: the law professors in the audience responded intensely to the topic. At the end, people approached me to say that it was as if I were seeing into their minds and marriages.\u201d Emens went on to turn her paper into a book, The Art Of Life Admin, a project which she says grew out of her own life. \u201cI was completely overwhelmed after my second child was born, with a whole lot of work that I didn\u2019t expect would go with parenting. I knew there would be diapers to change and mouths to feed, but it didn\u2019t occur to me that there would be so much paperwork. And mental labour. And it seemed largely an invisible part of parenting.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think I ate breakfast till I was 20, because my mum was just as disorganised and wouldn\u2019t set an alarm\n\nKim Palmer, a 40-year-old CEO of a tech company from Kent, can relate to this. \u201cI have emails, WhatsApp, Slack, Trello. Bills come in different formats \u2013 paper, email, I get notifications on apps. Trying to make sense of all that is really difficult.\u201d She recently sent her son to school in his uniform instead of fancy dress. \u201cI forgot,\u201d she sighs. \u201cThat\u2019s the second time this year he was meant to go in a dress-up outfit and didn\u2019t. I do feel bad but honestly, on the never-ending list of to-dos it was near the bottom. I know I should get more organised \u2013 I have a friend who is amazing: her life is spreadsheet heaven. But running a business and a household, I\u2019ve found that unless I prioritise quite strictly, my mental health suffers.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the same for Kenny Mammarella-D\u2019Cruz, a 55-year-old life coach. \u201cThe worst thing for me is modern society\u2019s obsession with emptying the inbox and staying on top of all our communications. Everything seems to happen faster than the speed of light,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all automated \u2013 bills, applications, reminders for medical appointments. I tried to do inbox zero for a time \u2013 it was impossible: I was constantly missing deadlines. It was a nightmare.\u201d\n\nEven professional administrators can be tripped up by personal tasks. Marie Richards, a 67-year-old retiree from Stratford-upon-Avon, spent the last 12 years of her working life as an administrator for Warwickshire police. \u201cBut at home I never did my own paperwork,\u201d she tells me. \u201cWe divided up the labour in the household; my husband did the paperwork and I attended to things related to our two daughters. I don\u2019t know, my brain just never worked that way. I never got things sorted in time. At work I was very good, but at home I switched off.\u201d When it came to pensions, though, Richards was adamant she would take charge. \u201cI did it all: the paperwork, telephone calls and anything that needed to be done online. If I\u2019m honest with you, I hated it. It made me incredibly anxious. Even now I hate receiving letters related to it, but I try not to put off opening them.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest So much to do: according to one survey, the average adult carries out 109 life admin tasks a year. Photograph: Getty Images\n\nHer husband, Keith Richards (not that one), also 67 and retired, suggests that we view admin more negatively now because of the huge shift in the way we perform it. \u201cA lot of my admin is keyboard-mediated \u2013 for example, I do my bank accounts online. My dad gave my mum the household cash each week and she separated it into different old handbags. If she wanted something, she\u2019d go to the relevant handbag and see what she had in notes and small change. And if you needed the bank, you had to go there. For my parents, there seemed to be fewer things to think about. I now feel bombarded with to-dos, but many of them take no time at all. I can hit a button and it\u2019s done. The quality of the interaction is different, and perhaps that\u2019s why it can feel like drudge work \u2013 there\u2019s rarely a human there.\u201d\n\nEmens argues that, \u201cCertain features of modern life make admin more pervasive. One of them is the rise of the bureaucratic state: we have more paperwork to complete, particularly around things like weddings, divorces, births and deaths. And another is technology, so admin reaches us with greater insistence and frequency. People expect us to respond to emails and texts; there\u2019s an escalation of demands.\u201d And where once we might have outsourced the business of booking a holiday, or the drudgery of filling in our tax return to an expert, we now turn to Airbnb, Skyscanner and Booking.com, or download apps such as QuickBooks. We build our own websites with Squarespace and cannibalise our lives to create content for social media. Individually each of these tasks might seem quick and painless, but as a whole they amount to a lot more work.\n\nSo much, in fact, that a whole new industry has sprung up to help us keep on top of it. Take the Bullet Journal, a specially designed notebook where to-dos are mindfully broken down into bullet points. It\u2019s so popular there are now Instagram accounts, each with thousands of followers, dedicated to the art of bullet journalling. Millions of us watch \u201cadmin routine\u201d YouTube videos and follow \u201ccleanfluencers\u201d, Marie Kondo disciples who have become famous for their tips on effective life admin management, as well as cleaning. The staggering popularity of what is, essentially, watching other people manage their to-do lists, hints at an overwhelmed population desperately trying to keep on top of myriad demands.\n\nThere is, of course, a spectrum of ineptitude, and I\u2019ve never let anything get so bad that it has threatened my livelihood. But there have been big oversights. I have paid for two separate phone contracts for an entire year, even though I had only one phone (I didn\u2019t realise I\u2019d been signed up to two contracts; then when I did, it took me a few months to call my phone company). And I paid a year\u2019s worth of insurance for phones I\u2019d long since lost and not claimed for. But I\u2019ve always been just organised enough to correct mistakes before the consequences became too dire. For some, though, errand paralysis can have terrifying consequences.\n\nSara Tasker, 35, a business consultant and author of Hashtag Authentic: Finding Creativity And Building A Community On Instagram And Beyond, is \u201cawful at life admin\u201d, she tells me. \u201cI\u2019m always running out of my prescriptions because there are so many steps that you have to remember. You have to notice you\u2019re running low and then call the GP and then collect it. That chain of events always trips me up \u2013 there are too many points at which it can break down.\u201d She would frequently forget to pay her phone bill, and also to invoice for work she\u2019d done, meaning she did not have enough money to fill up her car. Then disaster struck: \u201cI sold my car and forgot to send one of the pieces of paperwork to the DVLA. I then moved house twice and never got any of my redirected letters.\u201d She missed reminders and threats of a fine, and it wasn\u2019t until bailiffs came to her house, a week after the birth of her daughter, that she realised. \u201cI had to go with my newborn to stand in court and speak in front of magistrates, and declare that I hadn\u2019t received these letters so that the fine would be cancelled.\u201d\n\nTasker traces this chaos in her adult life to a similar atmosphere at home when she was growing up. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ate breakfast until I was 20 because my mum was just as disorganised, and wouldn\u2019t set an alarm, so we were always running late,\u201d she explains. \u201cI remember at school being frustrated that I couldn\u2019t apply myself in a way that you\u2019re told is the only right way. I wanted to do it, the reading and the homework, but coordinating all of it \u2013 actually sitting in a room and making it happen \u2013 never seemed to work out.\u201d There is something freeing in the way she refuses to see this as a moral defect. \u201cBecause most people find it really easy, they assume that everyone finds it easy. They assume that those of us who don\u2019t must be lazy or not trying hard enough. But it\u2019s not true. Going to court, a week after my daughter was born, took infinitely more effort than sending off one letter.\u201d She now employs her husband to take care of all her business and life admin, and has not missed a deadline since. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t met him, all that admin would have swallowed me up.\u201d\n\nEven a small task like clearing my inbox triggered anxiety. Now I can acknowledge the panic and move forward\n\nMammarella-D\u2019Cruz also says he can trace his own problems back to his early life, which was marked by trauma. At seven years old, he was living in a refugee camp in Uganda, separated from his father. He became the \u201cman of the family\u201d, and felt responsible for looking after his mother and younger brother. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any money or much food and I think I internalised the idea that I needed to stay out of trouble at any cost. Nowadays, it seems so easy to be \u2018in trouble\u2019. I run a successful business and have a great rapport with my clients. But outside of that, I feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of tasks we\u2019re expected to complete every day. I think for someone who didn\u2019t go through what I went through, or who hasn\u2019t experienced any significant mental health issues, it might seem more straightforward. But if you\u2019re working from a high-alert starting point, even seemingly small tasks like getting through your email backlog can trigger this incredible anxiety. You think, \u2018Who am I letting down?\u2019 and \u2018What if I\u2019ve done something wrong?\u2019 It stops you in your tracks.\u201d Like Tasker, Mammarella-D\u2019Cruz has employed his partner to help with the admin, and says, \u201cNow my wife works with me, I can just acknowledge the panic and then move forward. She makes all of that more manageable.\u201d\n\nEmens tells me she interviewed people of all ages about the shame of not being able to complete their to-do list. \u201cThat\u2019s a powerful emotion. Carrying shame around all the time must be pretty difficult.\u201d She\u2019s right. If I\u2019m not careful, the shame relating to my 5,203 unread emails starts to inform my opinion of myself more broadly; it is very difficult to get anything done if you are weighed down by the shame of not having done it yet.\n\nBut in July, I achieved a life admin milestone: I paid my taxes on time. I felt a small thrill of pride at sending the money, via online banking, on the day of the deadline. I felt lighter knowing that I wouldn\u2019t have to expect a threatening letter from HMRC. This, I thought, is what they must feel like, the people who\u2019ve got it together \u2013 I wanted more. On Emens\u2019 advice, I\u2019ve been riding the high by making some simple changes; I\u2019ve switched all my bills to direct debits and added notes to my Google calendar to remind me of important HMRC deadlines.\n\nI know I\u2019m not a completely reformed character; many of those 5,000-plus emails are likely to remain unread. But I also now see that perhaps it\u2019s not helpful to set emotional stock by my efficiency. Does it really matter if you are exceptionally organised, or exceptionally haphazard? None of it speaks to the truth of who we are as people.\n\nAnd as Emens points out, \u201cEven people who avoid life admin have some really useful strategies to teach those who get it all done \u2013 namely, that there are some tasks you shouldn\u2019t devote masses of energy to, because it\u2019s not an effective use of your time.\u201d In a world where there is more junk life admin than ever before, we all need to get strategic. For me, that means that on my next holiday, my travel partner will be in charge of the visas.\n\n\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).", "description": "\u2018Errand paralysis\u2019 might be the most boring and overwhelming anxiety of our age.
