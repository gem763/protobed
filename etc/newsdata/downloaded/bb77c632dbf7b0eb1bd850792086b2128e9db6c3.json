Herculaneum is the sister city of Pompeii.\n\nThe items were examined at the Diamond Light Source facility in Oxfordshire, home to Britain\u2019s synchrotron, a particle accelerator in which beams travel around a closed-loop path to produce light many times brighter than the sun.\n\n\u201cThe idea is essentially like a CT scanner where you would take an image of a person, a three-dimensional image of a person and you can slice through it to see the different organs,\u201d said Laurent Chapon, physical sciences director of Diamond Light Source.\n\n\u201cWe . . . shine very intense light through [the scroll] and then detect on the other side a number of two-dimensional images. From that we reconstruct a three-dimensional volume of the object . . . to actually read the text in a nondestructive manner,\u201d Chapon said.\n\nThe ink on the scrolls is difficult to see, even through a synchrotron, because it is carbon-based like the papyrus it is written on. But scientists said they hope the density of the paper will be different where written characters are present.\n\nBy scanning the Roman fragments where characters are visible, they hope to create a machine-learning algorithm that will decipher what is written on the scrolls.\n\nThe data generated by the process will be analyzed by scientists at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, Ky., using advanced computing techniques to decipher the scrolls\u2019 contents.\n\n\u201cThe library at Herculaneum was the only library that survived from antiquity, and because of that the material inside is extremely valuable,\u201d said Brent Seales, professor of computer science at the university. \u201cTexts from the ancient world are rare and precious, and they simply cannot be revealed through any other known process.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["George Sargent", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
