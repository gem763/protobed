Government is the top target for cyberattacks, followed by academia and tech companies. Managed service providers are the fourth most common organisations that the NCSC has helped with cyber incidents, followed by transport and health in joint fifth place.\n\n\"From handling more than 600 incidents \u2013 many from hostile nation states \u2013 to equipping the public with the tools they need to stay safe online, we are employing our expertise on a number of fronts,\" said Ciaran Martin, chief executive of the NCSC.\n\nThe report lists Russia, China, Iran and North Korea as hostile states actively targeting the UK with cyberattacks, following the NCSC strategy of calling out countries conducting attacks.\n\nThe NCSC is also trying to keep individual users safe from cyberattacks and has revealed one way it has been doing so is with something called the Haulster operation, which automates defence of credit cards by flagging fraudulent intention against them.\n\nHaulster takes stolen credit card data collected by the NCSC and its partners and returns information about them to banks \u2013 often before being used for crime, allowing financial institutions to protect users from their money being stolen. So far, this operation has flagged fraudulent information against a million stolen credit cards and the NCSC aims to increase the scope of the operation.\n\nThe NCSC also continued with its policy of Active Cyber Defence (ACD), a strategy designed to ensure there are fewer cyberattacks in the world, causing less harm to users in the UK and beyond in the process.\n\nA major element of this is a takedown service that stops phishing and other malicious websites from operating as soon as possible by contacting the web host and getting the sites removed from the internet.\n\nAccording to the annual report, 98% of phishing URLs \u2013 177,335 of them \u2013 discovered by the takedown service were successfully forced to stop operating. In 62% of cases, this happened within 24 hours of the website being deemed to be malicious.\n\nThe fight against these malicious domains means the UK only accounts for 2% of the websites hosting phishing scams around the world \u2013 down from 3% last year and 5% when the NCSC started operating.\n\nSEE: Cybersecurity: Why your suppliers are still your weakest link\n\nHowever, despite a number of successes from the NCSC, the organisation isn't under any illusion that the fight against cyberattacks and hacking is anywhere near over \u2013 and that everyone has a part to play in battle.\n\n\"Looking ahead, there is also the risk that advanced cyberattack techniques could find their way into the hands of new actors, through proliferation of such tools on the open market,\" said Martin.\n\n\"Cybersecurity has moved away from the exclusive prevail of security and intelligence agencies towards one that needs the involvement of all of government, and indeed all of society,\" he added.\n\nMORE ON CYBER SECURITY", "description": "The NCSC annual report reveals the number of incidents it has had to help organisations deal with in the past 12 months - and points to nation-state hackers as a major source.", "authors": ["Danny Palmer"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/22/09cf0b23-db5a-49b8-ac46-700db49a803e/thumbnail/770x578/9b6061754b6f4ac7101552b98a5afb19/hands-at-a-laptop-to-doing-cyber-stuff.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
