Flaunt it! Happily avoiding the drizzle of London, the famously-body confident TV personality flaunted her eye-popping curves in an aquamarine bikini as she leaned against a terrace wall at the hotel she is staying at\n\nShe followed this by musing on this quote, and by reflecting on her time abroad.\n\nShe wrote: 'We've been chatting a bit over the last few days about moments of feeling unhappiness and insecurities and wanting to change our appearance, or feeling unhappy and unloved and hoping to meet a guy.\n\n'We can all do and change whatever we want, but ultimately if we don't love ourselves, we're never going to feel happy. We've got to start focussing on loving ourselves, or making positive changes, to have long-standing happiness.\n\n'No amount of surgery or external person is going to change the way we feel about ourselves.\n\n'Guess we all need to talk about it and be reminded of it sometimes. Especially in this digital world of comparison. Thought of the day \u2764\ufe0f\u2728'\n\nLapping it up: She's currently enjoying a lavish stay in Corfu with fellow reality stars and infuencers\n\nThe day before, Ashley told MailOnline that teenage bullies used to make her feel ashamed of her hourglass curves, and it took many years before she finally accepted her body.\n\nThe ex-Made In Chelsea star, 32, admitted she struggled to find clothes to fit her large bust, as she officially launched her sustainable fashion line with Little Mistress.\n\nDuring the candid interview, Ashley also revealed that she's finally ready to find her 'soulmate' after six years of being single, but doesn't plan on using dating apps as she's pinning her search for Mr Right on finding a genuine connection.\n\nAshley has long been an advocate for body confidence and has regularly posted lengthy social media posts about struggling to accept her curves.\n\nShe posted alongside the snap the quote by Alan Watts that reads: 'If you see yourself in the correct way, you are all as much extraordinary phenomenon of nature as trees, clouds, the patterns in running water, the flickering of fire, the arrangement of the stars, and the form of a galaxy'\n\nShe told MailOnline: 'Living in the time of social media, it's hard enough going to school or university or work but then you're seeing people from offices all around the world and people who have different finances or pace it's really easy to feel self-conscious and compare yourself with other people.\n\n'For me especially my personal experience, I had really big boobs at the age of 13 and I was made to feel ashamed. I wasn't allowed to wear the same clothes as my friends, and at 13 you really don't understand why\u2026. Like ''If you show them off you're looking for male attention or you're a s**t'' or whatever it is.\n\n'It took me years and years and years to think ''oh I don't need to have a boob job.'' This is my body and my body is not my morals and doesn't dictate whether I'm an attention seeker or not.'\n\nAshley also revealed that since her career has taken off she has focused more on how she dresses, but prefers not to worry about her weight.\n\nShe added: 'I wasn't particularly fashion conscious, I didn't care about my appearance as much but as more I didn't really know what to wear.\n\nConfident: Ashley has long been an advocate for body confidence, but admitted she doesn't like to focus on her weight\n\n'I do photo shoots or I have stylists for events so I've learned much more about dressing in a way that suits me. I used to have one dress that I would wear going out for university. I didn't have a lot of clothes or money.'\n\nSpeaking about averting focus away from her weight, she added: 'I'm on a trip with a few girls and one of them was saying ''I've put on a stone'' and I said how do you know and she said ''scales.'' I was just saying '''why do you care?''. She said ''but my clothes don't fit'' and I said ''buy a bigger size then.'' It's frustrating to make people realise it's about confidence.\n\n'It's not just a number or a scale or a size in a piece of clothing, we all know i could be a 6, 8, 10 or 12 depending on where I go shopping.'\n\nAshley also exclusively revealed that she is finally ready to find love after six years of being single, but having grown comfortable with supporting herself, she has no plans to settle in her search for Mr Right.\n\nShe previously dated The Xtra Factor host Matt Richardson, but the couple split in 2014.\n\nTV star? As a presenter and DJ, Ashley said she wouldn't rule out taking part in another reality show, and would love to take part in I'm A Celebrity or The Island with Bear Grylls\n\nAshley added: 'I've been officially single for six years and I feel like I'm really pleased I've had that time in a way because I've got to do loads of things that people miss out on, like I'll do couples' things with my friends.\n\n'I put a lot of investment into my friendship but I definitely feel like I'm ready to meet the right person, but I'll never settle. Being on my own has given me an appreciation of knowing I can be happy by myself.\n\n'I'm in a position where I don't need to financially rely on anyone, but still I'm a hopeless romantic and I've had my heart broken.\n\n'It's hardest because the older you get the fussier you are, but I'm ready and I'm looking forward to meeting my soulmate, but whether that's next week or in two years I don't know.'", "description": "Ashley James couldn't resist taking to Instagram on Thursday to show off her frame in a bikini, while she basked in the Spanish sunshine.", "authors": ["Andrew Bullock For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/16/19843270-0-image-a-10_1571325037698.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
