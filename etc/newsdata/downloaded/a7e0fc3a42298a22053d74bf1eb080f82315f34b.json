In the same year, it also signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Nations to build a big data system dedicated to global contagion prevention.\n\nKT launched GEPP in Ghana last month and is currently working with Kenyan telco Safaricom to launch there as well.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nKT applies battery conserving tech on 5G network\n\nThe application of Connected Mode Discontinuous Reception (CDRX) technology will allow 5G smartphone owners to save battery life.\n\nKT launches contagion prevention app in Ghana\n\nThe app will alert Ghanaians of areas effected by epidemics such as ebola and connect them to nearby clinics.\n\nKT to expand deployment of 5G inside buildings\n\nKT will begin 5G services within large and crowded buildings such as airports and train stations.\n\nSamsung seals the deal on expanded KT LTE emergency network\n\nThe expanded coverage will deploy Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) through its networks.\n\nFlu prevention: Walgreens tracks influenza activity with Esri location analytics (TechRepublic)\n\nThis flu season is one of the worst in recent history, and data analytics are being used to help track activity across the nation.", "description": "Following launches in West Africa, the South Korean telco is set to expand the rollout of its epidemic prevention platform to Southeast Asia as well.", "authors": ["Cho Mu-Hyun"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/09/11ff6df0-db49-45d3-9852-e7e5380e4ff3/thumbnail/770x578/00ae03ceba3732c7758121c264e3ff4b/kt1-gepp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
