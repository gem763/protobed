The Boeing 737 MAX 8 crashed into the Java Sea after takeoff from Jakarta on Oct. 29, 2018, killing 189.\n\nBoeing on Friday said it is working to address concerns outlined in Indonesia's final report on the crash of a Lion Air 737 Max jet in October last year that killed all 189 people on board.\n\nA second crash less than five months later in Ethiopia killed all 157 people on board.\n\nThe report, released earlier Friday by Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee, faulted Boeing, saying the planes needed better cockpit design. It also said stronger oversight was needed by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies.\n\nMuch focus for both crashes has been the Boeing-designed anti-stall system known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS. Pilots in the two crashes struggled against the system which repeatedly pushed the planes' noses down until their final, fatal dives.\n\nIn its response to the report from Indonesian regulators, Boeing said it was redesigning the Angle of Attack sensors which inform the anti-stall system so that they would now turn the system on, only if both sensors agree.\n\nBoeing added the MCAS would now only activate once to \"erroneous\" AoA data and would \"always be subject to a maximum limit than can be overridden with the control column.\"\n\nThe U.S. plane-maker said the changes would prevent the flight conditions that caused the Lion Air crash from ever happening again.\n\nBoeing is also updating crew manuals and pilot training.", "description": "Indonesion regulators have issued their final report almost one year after a Lion Air 737 Max crashed, killing all 189 people on board.", "authors": ["David Reid"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105869616-gettyimages-1132062499.jpg?v=1569861782", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
