That\u2019s how Steve Martin and Martin Short are described \u2013 much to their embarrassment \u2013 in the publicity for their UK comedy tour, announced on Monday. I\u2019ve got them both on the phone from Dallas, Texas, on the morning of their latest gig, to discuss this late-career double act and UK visit. From 5,000 miles away, they hype up the Guardian, banter and backchat, punctuated by incongruous blasts on the banjo from Martin, aka one-sixth of bluegrass band Steep Canyon Rangers, who tour with the show.\n\nThe pair have been close friends since co-starring in The Three Amigos (with Chevy Chase) in 1986. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot together,\u201d says Martin: \u201cMarriage, deaths, births and divorces.\u201d It was shortly after the death of Short\u2019s wife, Nancy Dolman, and before the birth of Martin\u2019s first child (he was 67 at the time), that they were asked to interview one another on stage at the Chicago comedy festival. \u201cIt went really well,\u201d says Martin, \u201cand we said, \u2018Let\u2019s do it again, that was fun.\u2019 And the more we did it, the more we thought, \u2018We need a real show, we can\u2019t just sit there and talk.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo they came up with one, then were Emmy-nominated for its Netflix incarnation, entitled An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life. The actor (and Short\u2019s pal) Catherine O\u2019Hara described it as \u201ca children\u2019s show for adults\u201d, while others reached for the term vaudeville \u2013 which mystifies Martin and Short. \u201cI\u2019ve never quite understood what vaudeville means,\u201d says the latter, \u201cexcept that it\u2019s a quick succession of different acts. Which describes our show, I guess \u2013 because Steve and I do stuff together, then I do stuff alone, then Steve does, then he plays the banjo and we have this brilliant band come on.\u201d The term also reflects the old-school nature of the pair\u2019s relationship: their quick back-and-forth, the playful spirit of one-upmanship, the teasing that doesn\u2019t even pretend to conceal their fond camaraderie.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018We\u2019ve been through a lot together\u2019 \u2026 Steve Martin, Martin Short and Chevy Chase in Three Amigos! Photograph: Allstar/Orion Pictures\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely a double act,\u201d says Short. Martin references Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, Abbott and Costello \u2013 but insists: \u201cWe don\u2019t rely on nostalgia in our show.\u201d They\u2019re not trying to be old-fashioned, nor cash in on affection for their movie work. Yes, admits Short: \u201cIf you\u2019ve been in the movies when someone was 12 or 13, and now they\u2019re 40 and seeing your show, there\u2019s a nice feeling to that. It feels like you\u2019ve been part of their life.\u201d But the duo aren\u2019t resting on laurels, says Martin. \u201cI like to think of this as hopefully among the funniest shows the audience has ever seen. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to create.\u201d\n\nCue another blast of banjo, twanging down the line from Dallas. Time was, Martin was the hottest property in world comedy, a multi-award-winning standup (#11 of all time in Rolling Stone\u2019s 2017 roundup) with Hollywood at his feet. Then, in 1981, he quit, \u201cessentially depressed\u201d, he later said, and out of ideas. It was banjo-playing that lured him back on stage \u2013 but this matchup with Short (a fellow 80s-era Saturday Night Live star, if not an exact contemporary) represents a return to live comedy after three decades away. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really enjoying it because of the company,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve done things on my own, and it\u2019s not the same as having friends to share the ups and downs with. Although there are very few downs, I must say.\u201d Short agrees: \u201cWe absolutely adore doing this show.\u201d That\u2019s why they\u2019re hitting the road at an age (Short is 69, Martin 74) when \u2013 in Short\u2019s own modest appraisal \u2013 \u201cwe\u2019ve got the rent covered.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s easy for you to say, Marty!\u201d pipes up Martin.\n\n\u201cWell, I have the rent covered,\u201d says Short. \u201cHe buys expensive paintings.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Twang!

At this question, discord breaks out. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re pretty connected,\u201d says Short \u2013 but Martin interrupts. \u201cI was just going to disagree. I have no idea what\u2019s going on.\u201d Turns out, Martin retains a post-traumatic dislike of live comedy clubs. \u201cI get this taste of cheap wine in my mouth and hostile audiences. So I don\u2019t like to go see comedy live.\u201d But if you want to be the funniest show ever, don\u2019t you need to keep up with the competition? \u201cWell, I don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re in competition,\u201d says Martin. \u201cI used to.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why both are happy that their double act has assembled only in the twilight of their careers. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect time,\u201d they both say. \u201cIf we\u2019d done it in the 80s,\u201d says Martin, \u201cwe would measure it a little more and be more competitive. But at this point we\u2019re not. We\u2019re just playing to an audience. We like them, they like us, and everything is fine.\u201d Both agree that Martin is the \u201csensitive\u201d one of the duo, more concerned about audience reaction. \u201cYou\u2019re more of an artist,\u201d says Short \u2013 whereas he, Short, is the \u201cconfident\u201d one. \u201cWe always say about Marty that he\u2019s laughing on the outside,\u201d says Martin, \u201cand laughing on the inside too.\u201d\n\nHow a British audience will react to their show \u2013 entitled The Funniest Show in Town at the Moment, and \u201c70% different\u201d (says Martin) to the Netflix special \u2013 is \u201can unknown question\u201d. So too the one with which Martin signs off from our call: \u201cDo you think the Queen will come to our show?\u201d In London, they\u2019re playing the Royal Albert Hall, and \u201cwe can get her comps,\u201d says Short, faux-eagerly. Might the Queen be a Three Amigos fan? You wouldn\u2019t bet against it. \u201cI know Americans can\u2019t get knighthoods,\u201d says Martin. \u201cBut they always make exceptions! I\u2019m going to be sitting by the phone waiting for my knighthood call.\u201d", "description": "Two of the Three Amigos are hitting the road with a banter and banjo-filled double act.
