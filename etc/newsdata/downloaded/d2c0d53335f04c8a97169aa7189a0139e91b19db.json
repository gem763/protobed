Everybody knows the best way to prepare for a hurricane is by playing golf.\n\nBeating a Category 5 is nothing if you can birdie a par five (the 590-yard 12th hole on Trump National Golf Club\u2019s Championship Course is \u201cmonstrous\u201d). Though recent hurricanes have been some of \u201cthe wettest we\u2019ve ever seen, from the standpoint of water,\u201d they are less intimidating after you\u2019ve survived the eighth hole of the Riverview Course: not one but two merciless water hazards blocking your approach.\n\nHurricanes are best weathered from bunkers, and you can bet Trump spent time in those this weekend with his sand wedge. Think high winds are a threat during hurricanes? They\u2019re even more hazardous to your handicap; it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if, in true emergencies, Trump has resorted to a 2-iron to reduce loft. And not even a meteorologist studies rotation as closely as a golfer; just one slice and all models project you\u2019ll make landfall in the deep rough.\n\nEssentially, Trump was on the fairways doing exactly what we\u2019d want our president to be do during a natural disaster \u2014 with a few minor revisions:\n\nThe president canceled a trip to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the start of World War II, allowing him to give his undivided attention to Hurricane Dorian play rounds of golf both Saturday and Monday at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia.\n\nIn his place, he sent the vice president to Europe to renew the enduring transatlantic bond stay at the Trump International Golf Links and Hotel in Doonbeg, Ireland. The president also delivered a somber message chipper greeting to Poles on the anniversary of the Nazi invasion, recalling the death and suffering of millions of Poles saying: \u201cI just want to congratulate Poland.\u201d\n\nAt a briefing before last year\u2019s hurricane season, the president honed a sophisticated knowledge of tropical storms spoke aimlessly about catapults on aircraft carriers. Three other Category 5 storms had already occurred during his presidency, which meant that he was well-prepared to respond to such a storm didn\u2019t stop him on Sunday from declaring, again, that \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever even heard of a Category 5.\u201d\n\nHis director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and his secretary of homeland security were both seasoned veterans serving in temporary, \u201cacting\u201d capacities, and his head of the Coast Guard provided him storm updates packed with sophisticated government data that \u201cyou can pretty much get . . . on television.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, when the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for the Bahamas, the president announced that he would spare no expense in aiding relief efforts \u201cthe top shows on @FoxNews and cable ratings are those that are Fair (or great) to your favorite President, me!\u201d He expressed confidence that Florida Mar-a-Lago could withstand the storm. After learning during an intelligence briefing Friday that Iran had an unsuccessful rocket launch, the president coordinated a response with allies trolled Iran by including in a tweet an image that may have revealed covert U.S. activities.\n\nOn Saturday, when the hurricane center warned of Dorian\u2019s \u201clife-threatening storm surge and devastating winds,\u201d the president spent the day overseeing emergency preparations attacking former FBI director James Comey, celebrating his success on \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d responding to a now-former aide\u2019s claim that he disapproves of his daughter\u2019s weight (\u201cI love Tiffany, doing great!\u201d) and playing golf. The president had said he would \u201cnot have time to play golf in office\u201d has played 213 rounds of golf while in office.\n\nOn Sunday, the president, asked about the deteriorating situation in Colombia, appealed for restraint by leftist FARC guerrillas replied: \u201cYou\u2019re talking about the country of Colombia?\u201d Following a FEMA briefing on the now \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and intensifying Dorian, the president reinforced official warnings unilaterally declared that Alabama, where no storm damage was forecast, would also \u201cmost likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, as storm warnings widened, the president spent hours on the phone with emergency management officials playing golf again and checking on pre-positioning of relief supplies attacking the AFL-CIO chief, economist Paul Krugman, the \u201cFake News Media\u201d and four nonwhite congresswomen.\n\nOn Tuesday, the hurricane center said Dorian would soon \u201cmove dangerously close\u201d to Florida, then Georgia and the Carolinas; the president prayerfully summoned the nation\u2019s resolve attacked the Federal Reserve, the mayor of London, former president Barack Obama and \u201cthe whole Witch Hunt against me.\u201d\n\nAnd, all across this great land, Americans rallied to the cause wondered: Do hurricanes give mulligans?\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "Do hurricanes give mulligans?", "authors": ["Dana Milbank", "Op-Ed Columnist Covering National Politics", "September At Pm", "Dana Milbank Is An Op-Ed Columnist.
