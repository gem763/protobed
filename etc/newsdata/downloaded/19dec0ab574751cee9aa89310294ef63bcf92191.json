The trio say their goal is to encourage young people to stop climate change.\n\nThey admit that may no longer be achievable in their lifetimes, but they warn the consequences could be dire for the audiences they're hoping to attract \u2014 if they don't act.\n\nSuzuki spoke with As it Happens host Carol Off about why the three are launching the tour at the start of a federal election campaign. Here is part of their conversation.\n\nBetween Buffy Sainte-Marie, Stephen Lewis and yourself, it's quite a lineup of stars. But you're all senior citizens, sorry to say. What's your appeal to young people?\n\nI call us the \"Silverback Gorillas and the Grizzly Mom.\" I believe we've earned the right to speak as elders, as seniors. And our commonality with youth is that we no longer have a vested interest in the status quo. We don't have to play games to get a job or a raise or a promotion. We're not interested in money or fame or power. And so we're free now to speak the truth from our hearts.\n\nYoung people have everything at stake for the big decisions that have to be made in the coming months. And so we feel as as silverbacks, we want to pass on our life experiences and maybe point out the pitfalls or the strengths of what they're doing.\n\nA poster for 'The Climate First Tour' featuring activists David Suzuki and Stephen Lewis, and singer-songwriter Buffy Sainte-Marie. (Kevin Ball/CBC)\n\nBut if there's any demographic who gets it \u2014 who understands the imperatives here, dealing with climate change and the environment \u2014 it has to be young people. So aren't you preaching to the converted?\n\nI hope you're right because they certainly have become very active. I think Greta Thunberg from Sweden has had a galvanizing impact on young people. But, you know, their voting record in the past has been very poor. Eighteen- to 22-year-olds coming into the voting age are traditionally not a high participation group.\n\nBut our message is: you've got to do more than just get out and vote. That's the most critical thing.\n\nYou've got to galvanize your peer group. And you've got to demand of everyone running for office \u2014 whatever party they're in \u2014 you've got to say, \"Is climate change your No. 1 issue?\" Because this must not remain a partisan issue. This is an issue as if we are at war.\n\n\n\nYou know, when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and [then-U.S. president Franklin] Roosevelt declared war then, nobody said, \"Aw, this guy is going to break the bank. Our economy is going to go to hell. These damn Democrats don't have the right priorities.\" Everybody got together.\n\nWhen the Raptors were playing in the finals, you know, all of Canada \u2014 even Montreal, for God's sakes \u2014 was rooting for Toronto. We need that kind of spirit.\n\nFormer Ontario NDP leader Stephen Lewis will be part of the tour. (Codie McLachlan/The Canadian Press)\n\nSo how do young people \u2014 how do you direct them? And they have very few options in voting.\n\nThey are a group that traditionally has not been on the political priority \u2014 because quite frankly, when politicians are elected the first concern is re-election. And children don't vote.\n\n\n\nAnd so one call is for young people to galvanize their parents and everybody who cares about them, and where we're going to become eco-warriors to demand before the election that this be put up as a No. 1 issue.\n\nYou're absolutely right. Right now, climate is a partisan issue.\n\nIf it remains a partisan issue, when we go into another government \u2014 doesn't matter which government it is \u2014 if climate isn't the No. 1 issue, then it seems to me we're just sacrificing the future of youngsters for political concern.\n\nAS IT HAPPENS: Elections Canada should not make climate change a partisan issue, says charity\n\nYou mentioned how you have no other interests in this, you've lived well. You're not alone in that, we've all lived well, [those] of our generation. What is it for young people to say, \"Well, it's easy for you to say that. I've got student debt, and now you want me this to save the planet.\" What do you say to them?\n\nYou've just sent a spear through my chest. I met three of the girls \u2014 well, they were young women \u2014 who organized the last big march in Montreal when there were 150,000 people on the streets a few months ago. And when I had the chance to meet them, quite frankly, I broke down and cried.\n\nI cried not out of gratitude, but I cried that these young people who should be developing their life goals and their skills and so on have to be the ones that are driving the demand for action on climate that my generation and the boomers that followed \u2014 we have partied like there was no tomorrow. And we didn't think about the repercussions.\n\nSo yes, and there's a lot of sense of guilt and sadness on my part. But look, we've just got to get on with it. My carbon footprint has been enormous. To make films, I've done a lot of flying and I regret that. But we've got to get on with the challenge now.\n\nBuffy Sainte-Marie performs at the Americana Music Honors and Awards show in Nashville, Tenn., in 2015. (Mark Zaleski/Canadian Press/Associated Press)\n\nOne other area I want to ask you about, because we've been covering it these weeks \u2014 the way that environmentalists who are active on this file are being attacked online. These are vulnerable young people who are reading this stuff online. How intimidating\u2014 because it's designed to intimidate, right? So how intimidating do you think some of this stuff might be?\n\nI've been run off the road when I was jogging in Haida Gwaii by a trucker who was hauling logs. I've been told not to come to towns, logging towns in British Columbia. And we actually had a bullet fired through our window in Vancouver.\n\nI mean, I'm just thinking on Sunday, I was filming in Montreal. And the crew and I were sitting in a restaurant a guy came up \u2014 sidled right up, he wasn't invited. He just sat right down next to me and he said, \"I have to tell you, you are nothing but a fraud. Everything you say about climate change is bulls--t.\"\n\nNow I think he would have done more, but I was sitting with the crew around me. And I finally, and in the finest intellectual terms, I told him to F off.\n\nBut had I been alone, it might have been a different kind of confrontation.\n\nSo my heart goes out again to the warriors \u2014 and as you say, the women become particularly vulnerable and are the major targets for it. It's the kind of time that we have.\n\nThe premier of Alberta, one of the first things he did was to set up a war room. And I think we need a war room because I think the battle against climate change is a war.\n\nInterview produced by Kevin Roberston.
