A world record could be in the offering.\n\nWith Warholm already the second fastest at the distance (46.92), his race with the two men tied for third best (46.98) - American Rai Benjamin and Qatari Abderrahmane Samba - could be the perfect place to smash American Kevin Young\u2019s 1992 world record of 46.78.\n\nCHRISTIAN COLEMAN, USA, 100m, 200m, 4x100m relay\n\nThe 23-year-old Coleman always was going to be the centre of attention in the 100 metres as the year\u2019s fastest man (9.81 seconds).\n\nBut when the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) filed - and later withdrew - a whereabouts violations charge against the world silver medallist that heightened interest since Coleman could have received a one or two-year sanction.\n\nTo strike double gold in Doha, the fast starting Coleman, who holds the indoor 60m world record, must defeat 37-year-old defending champion Justin Gatlin to win the 100m and upset the favoured Noah Lyles in the 200.\n\nNo man Gatlin\u2019s age has ever run a 100m as fast as the 2005 and 2017 world champion.\n\nTIMOTHY CHERUIYOT, Kenya, 1,500m\n\nThree times the Diamond League champion, the year\u2019s fastest 1,500m runner is hoping to streak to his first world title after a string of seconds.\n\nNow aged 23, Cheruiyot was runner-up at the 2017 worlds, 2018 Commonwealth Games and 2016 and 2018 African championships.\n\nBut he has put together a sparkling run of eight victories in nine races at 1.500m/mile, including a 2019 best 3:28.77 and has bigger ambitions.\n\nCheruiyot would need to break the 3:26 barrier to acquire the world record since Moroccan Hicham El Guerrouj ran 3:26.00 in Rome in 1998.\n\nCHRISTIAN TAYLOR, USA, triple jump\n\nTaylor flew 5,000 miles for a quick jump at the U.S. championships to preserve his wild card spot for Doha.\n\nNow he will really have to jump to win what could be the top field event rivalry of the world championships.\n\nWith world silver medallist and U.S. teammate Will Claye the only triple jumper over 18 metres this year, double Olympic champion Taylor, 29, will need to go all out to win a fourth world title.\n\nIt\u2019s a feat no triple jumper has ever accomplished.\n\nSAM KENDRICKS, USA, pole vault\n\nOnly the legendary Sergey Bubka has vaulted higher outdoors than Kendricks\u2019 clearance of 6.06 metres to win the U.S. championship in July.\n\nNow he, Frenchman Renaud Lavillenie (who holds the world record with an indoor vault of 6.16m), American-born Swede Mondo Duplantis and Poland\u2019s Piotr Lisek vie in a friendly rivalry for Kendricks\u2019 2017 world title.\n\nIf the American wins again, he would be the first male pole vaulter to repeat since Bubka won six consecutive world titles between 1983 and 1997.\n\nJUAN MIGUEL ECHEVARRIA, Cuba, long jump\n\nWhen the Cuban roars down the runway, big marks usually follow.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nHis leap of 8.68 metres last year was the best jump in nearly a decade and the 21-year-old appears to be rounding into shape for another big mark at the world championships after bounding 8.65m at the Zurich Diamond League meeting.\n\nEchevarria went even further in Havana earlier this year.\n\nBut his mark of 8.92m was powered by an over-the-allowable wind of 3.3 metres per second. Still, only four jumps have been further under any conditions, including Mike Powell\u2019s 1991 world record of 8.95m.", "description": "Key men to watch at the Sept 27-Oct 6 world athletics championships in Doha:", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434262784&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1VP", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
