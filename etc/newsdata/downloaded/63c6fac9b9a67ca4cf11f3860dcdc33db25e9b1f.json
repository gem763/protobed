We repeat: 58.", "language": "en", "text": "Walker had the penalty strokes applied to the two rounds she played this week at the Senior LPGA Championship in French Lick, Ind., on Monday and Tuesday. Forty-two of them gave her a first-round score of 127 and the other 16 pushed her second-round score to 90.\n\nNeedless to say, she didn\u2019t make the cut, but she would have only missed it by one stroke without the penalties. As it was, she was left to tell the Associated Press, \u201cIt was my fault for not knowing the rules.\"\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anyone to blame but myself,\u201d Walker added. \u201cBig lesson learned.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn this case, the lesson involved Rule 10.2b(4), part of a major overhaul enacted at the beginning of this year by the United States Golf Association.\n\n\u201cOnce the player begins taking a stance for the stroke, and until the stroke is made,\u201d the new rule states, \u201cthe player\u2019s caddie must not deliberately stand on or close to an extension of the line of play behind the ball for any reason.\u201d\n\nUnaware of that rules change, Walker said she was regularly having her caddie help line her up for putts, and she \u201cdid not reset.\u201d\n\nHer mistake went unnoticed by her first-round playing partners and she was through several holes the next day before the women with whom she was competing pointed it out.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI called a rules official to ask what to do,\u201d she said. \u201cThey had me continue playing so they could have a conference on the violation and what I needed to do.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWalker was eventually asked to recall the instances in which her caddie remained behind her when she assumed her putting stance. She cited 21 times in the first round and eight times in the second, which each infraction resulting in a two-stroke penalty.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t mad; I wasn\u2019t upset,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI was just like, \u2018That\u2019s going to add a ton to my scores.\u2019 At that point, what can you do?\"\n\nNow a real estate agent in her home state of North Carolina, Walker turned pro in 1995 and competed for many years on the LPGA and Symetra Tours. The LPGA\u2019s website shows that she earned $324,271 over 136 events played.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is my first competitive round since 2011 or 2012,\u201d she said. \u201cNow that I don\u2019t play the LPGA anymore, I don\u2019t watch golf.\n\n\u201cI knew there were rules changes. I just honestly didn\u2019t know \u2019em. Just plain and simple.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the only noteworthy rules violation committed recently by a player in a prominent event. During Sunday\u2019s final round of the SAS Championship in Cary, N.C. \u2014 Walker\u2019s old stomping grounds \u2014 Jesper Parnevik cost himself a stroke by not taking a mulligan.\n\nThe 54-year-old Swede was trying to clean up a short bogey putt, but the ball rolled around the cup, came back toward him and struck him in the foot. Parnevik then tapped in from that spot for what he thought would be a double-bogey, only to discover that his score would be even worse.\n\nAD\n\nIt turns out that he was required by Rule 11.1.b, Exception 2, to play a mulligan from the spot of the original putt. He did not, and ultimately was given a two-stroke penalty based on his second putt, essentially considered a mulligan from an incorrect spot, for a triple-bogey.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen a ball on the putting green accidentally hits any person, animal or immovable obstruction, this stroke does not count and the ball must be replaced on its original spot,\u201d rules official Brian Claar told Reuters.\n\n\u201cJesper tapped it in. In that situation he\u2019s played from the wrong place. Unfortunately he gets a two-stroke penalty for playing from the wrong place, and the one where he tapped in counts but the original stroke does not count.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs far as Walker\u2019s two-day gaffe was concerned, she claimed it was attributable to her \u201cstupidity for not going over the rules changes.\u201d She said she was inspired to return to competition at the Senior LPGA Championship in part because she had heard so many good things about the Pete Dye Course.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I went. I got to see a lot of great friends, it was a great golf course, great event,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything was great \u2014 except for my penalties.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "\"Big lesson learned,\" said Lee Ann Walker, who \"knew there were rules changes\" but wasn't quite up-to-date on the specifics.", "authors": ["Des Bieler", "Sports Reporter Covering National Topics", "Including Fantasy Football", "As Well As Supporting Coverage Of D.C.-Area Teams"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gU6jQeq__PrCDFv50O-UNHjjWJE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GYLWHERZTZHLVEDPXWKUOXJB5Q.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
