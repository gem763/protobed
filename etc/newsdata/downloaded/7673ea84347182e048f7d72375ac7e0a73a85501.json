Swiss Bank Group Lambasts Negative Rates for Damaging the Economy\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The Swiss Bankers Association criticized the central bank\u2019s policy of negative rates, saying it was causing \u201cmassive structural damage\u201d to the economy.\n\nAt -0.75%, the Swiss National Bank\u2019s policy rate is the lowest in the G-10 as the central bank tries to stem appreciation pressure on the haven . With momentum flagging, euro-area officials are likely to announce a further cut to already sub-zero interest rates later on Thursday and may also announce new asset purchases. That could prompt the SNB to deliver a rate cut of its own.\n\nIn addition to hampering Swiss banks\u2019 competitiveness internationally, negative interest rates are \u201cresult in bubbles and damage the competitiveness of the Swiss economy long term because they keep unprofitable companies alive artificially,\u201d the sector representative said. \u201cNegative interest rates also put the pensions of Swiss citizens at risk. A further lowering of interest rates would further exacerbate this issue.\u201d\n\nUnlike neighboring Italy, Switzerland hasn\u2019t struggled with non-performing loans on banks\u2019 balance sheets. SNB President Thomas Jordan has also said that it\u2019s low real interest rates globally that are making life difficult for savers.\n\nThe SNB\u2019s next policy announcement is scheduled for Sept. 19.", "description": "Swiss Bank Group Lambasts Negative Rates for Damaging the Economy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEBBG0I2_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
