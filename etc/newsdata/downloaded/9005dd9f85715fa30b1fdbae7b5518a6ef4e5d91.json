It is said to be the world\u2019s largest single-building airport terminal. At 700,000 sq metres, with four runways, it is expected to be able to handle 72 million passengers a year by 2025. By 2040, the airport is expected to expand to eight runways and accommodate 100 million passengers a year.\n\nOfficials have been showing off the sleek new airport for the past year, hosting tours of the space, which is to include customer-service robots to deliver flight information and facial recognition-enabled check-in.\n\nCritics have questioned the need for a second airport in the capital, especially one that is almost twice the distance from the city centre as the existing airport.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Interior view of Daxing airport in Beijing.
