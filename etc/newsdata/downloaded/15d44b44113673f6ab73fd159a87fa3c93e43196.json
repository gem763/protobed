A handful of scorching moments belong to Dern\u2019s Nora, who\u2019s hired as Nicole\u2019s high-priced, attack-dog attorney. The role is one of the highlights of Dern\u2019s career.\n\nShe made her debut in 1974, aged seven, as an extra opposite her mother in Martin Scorsese\u2019s Alice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Anymore. But the films that marked her out were Peter Bogdanovich\u2019s Mask and the series of pictures she made with David Lynch that included Blue Velvet and Wild At Heart.\n\n\u2018I went from the innocent girl-next-door in Mask to playing raw sexuality, all fever, in Wild At Heart,\u2019 she said.\n\nDern has not stopped working since. She won plaudits for her role as Renata Klein in two seasons of Big Little Lies on Sky Atlantic; she\u2019s playing Marmee in Greta Gerwig\u2019s highly anticipated Little Women; and during our interview Dern mused about scheduling a call with Steven Spielberg to discuss making another Jurassic Park film.\n\nDern (pictured left) and Scarlett Johansson star in upcoming film Marriage Story. It is set to be one of Dern's career highlights, as she plays a high-priced, attack-dog attorney for Nicole (played by Johansson) during her divorce\n\nNetflix adverts show the incisive and compassionate portrait of a marriage breaking up and a family staying together, set to be released this autumn,. It contains a number of scorching moments for Dern which could be a career highlight for the Little Women and Big Little Lies star\n\nBut at the Telluride, Toronto and current BFI London Film Festivals, much attention has been paid to Netflix\u2019s sensation, Marriage Story: \u2018a love story about divorce\u2019, as Dern puts it.\n\nEighteen months before there was even a script, Dern and Baumbach had a series of fried chicken suppers, washed down with red wine, to talk about the film and her role. They also went to meetings with a handful of Los Angeles female divorce lawyers.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a world of men, predominantly,\u2019 said Dern when we met at London\u2019s Ham Yard Hotel.\n\nCast: She also appears to capture the attention of when she plays Marmee (pictured next to Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet)\n\nDern\u2019s Nora has a marvellous client-getting \u2018seduction\u2019 scene with Johansson\u2019s Nicole, the latter an actress who has moved out of the Manhattan apartment she shared with director husband Charlie (Driver) and moved, with the couple\u2019s eight-year-old son, to her hometown of LA.\n\nDern talked me through how, in one swift carefully choreographed moment, she went from standing to falling on a couch beside Johansson.\n\n\u2018Noah was specific, down to not only what the heels were [ruby-red Christian Louboutins], but how I kick them off. I\u2019ll never forget how he rehearsed me from standing in front of Scarlett and how I needed to get from there to being her best friend next to her on the couch.\n\nThe actress won plaudits for her role as Renata Klein in two seasons of Big Little Lies on Sky Atlantic and is starring in Marriage Story along side actor Adam Driver. She has described the upcoming film as a 'love story about divorce'\n\n\u2018It\u2019s so manipulative. It\u2019s like: \u201cOh, we\u2019re girlfriends now. Here\u2019s lemon tea. Oh, and have a cookie. If you like them I\u2019ll courier some over.\u201d \u2019\n\nLA is like the cradle of divorce, Dern told me. When she was in her teens, she always wondered what it would be like to have a normal childhood and be raised by two parents who were married and lived together. Then she found out that a \u2018normal\u2019 childhood in California involved divorce.\n\nHer experiences flavour her performance in a film packed with acting of a breathtaking quality that\u2019s bound to feature highly this awards season. There\u2019s an indelible moment in which Dern\u2019s Nora articulates to Johansson\u2019s Nicole the double standards society imposes on mothers. \u2018A dad can be a f***-up, but not a mother,\u2019 Nora warns her.\n\nDern portrays Marmee March, mother to the close-knit sisters in the highly-anticipated series Little Women by Greta Gerwig\n\nAudiences I\u2019ve watched the picture with (I\u2019ve seen it four times) are hooked by Baumbach\u2019s poetic screenplay.\n\nDern steps out in a denim trench coat and patterned dress on Telluride Film Festival 2019 on August 30\n\nDern said she felt inspired by Nora. \u2018She scares me and makes me laugh. She\u2019s such a cautionary tale. I hope people in love see the movie and think: \u201cOh, my God!\u201d I beg people to really stay communicating and always avoid getting to someone like a Nora.\u2019\n\nShe added that she understood the longing to be a good mother and not wanting the child to be badly affected by a break-up.\n\n\u2018Among the cast and crew, I don\u2019t think there was anyone who hadn\u2019t been impacted by divorce in some way. We led with our hearts and people were weeping as scenes were shot; and we were laughing hysterically, too.\u2019\n\nAs someone who is raising two children (\u2018they\u2019re teenagers, but they\u2019re my babies\u2019), Dern said she was moved when Jaya, her 14-year-old daughter, shared her perspective of Marriage Story.\n\nJaya recounted a scene where the couple and their lawyers are at a mediation session, and the husband Charlie can\u2019t decide what to order for lunch.\n\n\u2018She said she was so moved by how Scarlett\u2019s character was the only one who knows to order that salad for him.\n\n\u2018My daughter said: \u201cMom, that is heartbreak. That\u2019s the only person on the planet who knows just what you like and knows how to save you when you\u2019re at a loss.\u201d\n\n\u2018And I recount that as a daughter whose parents had a very difficult and painful divorce.\u2019\n\nGirl power Rocks Bukky\u2019s debut\n\nWhen film-maker Sarah Gavron and writers Theresa Ikoko and Claire Wilson were working on a new project, they realised that something was holding them back: the male of the species.\n\n\u2018We realised men were getting in the way,\u2019 said Ms Ikoko. So they threw away the script, chucked out the blokes and concentrated on making a group of young, unknown teenage girls the stars of what would become Rocks. Some boys were allowed in the film, but females rule the screen. \u2018It was a relief,\u2019 said Wilson of starting afresh with a cast led by Bukky Bakray, who signed up for a series of workshops and ended up playing the title character, a London schoolgirl who has to help raise her younger brother and is supported by her high school posse.\n\nThe picture was a surprise hit at the Toronto Film Festival last month and it is being presented at the BFI London Film Festival tonight and tomorrow. It is due to be released next spring.\n\nFemales first: (From left) Gavron, Ikoko, Bakray and Wilson say men were holding them back from working on a new project.
