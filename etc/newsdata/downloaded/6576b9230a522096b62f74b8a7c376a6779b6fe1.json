This is roughly the opposite of what Gallup found in June when asked in the context of special counselor Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nSince June, Democrats\u2019 and independents\u2019 support for impeachment has grown, while Republicans\u2019 views have not changed. The change among independents is enough that a majority of that group (55%) now favors Trump being impeached and removed from office. Support for impeachment was already high among Democrats, at 81%, but now approaches 90%. Just 6% of Republicans are in favor of Trump being impeached.", "description": "", "authors": ["News.Gallup.Com Poll Congress-Approval-Support-Impeaching-Trump.Aspx"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
