Up front are two USB sockets, with rear passengers getting a 12 v socket.\n\nThe new Captur is 11 cm longer than the outgoing model, with 17 mm more legroom in the back, a boot that's 81 litres bigger, plus 27 litres of cubby-hole storage\n\nThe car is also Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatible.\n\nThere's huge potential for customisation with 11 body colours including Atacama Orange, Flame Red and Iron Blue, four contrasting roof colours and three external customisation packs available at launch, giving up to 90 possible combinations.\n\nIt can also be fitted with roof bars or a semi-glazed opening sunroof.\n\nThe flexible rear bench can slide forward and back by up to 16cm to maximise either legroom or boot space and folds down in a split pattern to create a near-flat 1.57m floor.\n\nThe flexible rear bench can slide forward and back by up to 16cm to maximise either legroom or boot space\n\nEngine options are yet to be finalised, but expect a 1.3 litre turbo four-cylinder petrol (either 130 hp or 155 hp) and a 1.0 litre 100 hp three-cylinder petrol.\n\nDiesel options may include an improved 1.5 litre Blue dCi with 95 hp and six-speed manual, and a 115 hp version, either manual or seven-speed automatic.\n\nA hybrid will follow. Prices for the range start at \u00a316,000.\n\nRoutemaster just keeps on rolling\n\nIf you loved Cliff Richard in Summer Holiday, the Seventies children's TV series Here Come The Double Deckers, or just fancy riding 'up top', this could be for you.\n\nThe original London Routemaster \u2014 not the updated versions introduced by Boris Johnson when Mayor of London \u2014 is rightly world famous.\n\nAnd it continues to thrive. The bus pictured above dates from 1967 and spent 37 years on the streets of the capital, after which it was snapped up by the Vintage Bus Company, based in Sevenoaks, Kent.\n\nIt recently had an overhaul and is in fine working order, proving popular for transporting guests at weddings or other events.\n\nA uniformed driver will be in charge and you can decorate the bus pretty much as you please. It seats 72 \u2014 and there's no need to bring along your Oyster card.\n\nPrices start from \u00a3400. Book at thevintagebus company.co.uk or call 01732 469 800.\n\nBMW tees off with a new 1 Series\n\nThe new BMW 1 series is available with front-wheel or all-wheel drive, it promises more space, power and efficiency and is on sale now from \u00a324,430\n\nGolf fans at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth last weekend had an early peek at the new 1 Series four-door hatchback, now on sale from \u00a324,430.\n\nAvailable in front-wheel or all-wheel drive, it promises more space, power and efficiency, as well as an array of driver assistant systems including head-up display.\n\nDeliveries of this rival to the VW Golf, Audi A3 and Mercedes-Benz A-Class start from the end of the month.\n\nVolvo's best if you're on the pull\n\nVolvo's happy campers have clinched a hat-trick of awards as their XC40 SUV has been named Towcar of the Year 2020 by the Caravan and Motorhome Club.\n\n'Effortless': Volvo's XC40 SUV has been named Towcar of the Year 2020 by the Caravan and Motorhome Club\n\nThe XC40 D4 (which can tow up to 2.1 tons) also won best performance in the 1,400kg to 1,500kg caravan weight category, with the V60 D4 winning the 1,500kg to 1,700kg category.\n\nJudges tested 36 vehicles at the Millbrook proving ground in Bedfordshire and said the XC40's performance was 'effortless'.", "description": "Renault hopes to seize a chunk of the British market with the latest generation of its funky compact Sports Utility Vehicle.
