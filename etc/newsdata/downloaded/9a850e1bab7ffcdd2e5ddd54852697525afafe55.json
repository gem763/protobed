You don't have to be an engineer to realise the town's in trouble,' he said.\n\nTenterfield depends on an 87-year-old water filtration plant in desperate need of an upgrade which will require additional upgrades to the unit to treat sewage water.\n\nResidents are already forced to sterilise water for everyday usage with hospitals and school children are relying heavily on trucked-in bottled water.\n\nMr Dodds said he wouldn't use the recycled water unless it was above the standard of purity that is already provided to the town and on Tuesday he will be meeting with NSW Health for approval.\n\nThe entire town relies on an 87-year-old filtration system that needs to be upgraded to process waste water\n\nTenterfield's drought the worst in history The Bureau of Meteorology revealed in July the drought surrounding the Murray Darling basin and Tenterfield is officially the worst in Australia's history. In June the charity Rural Aid donated portable desalination plants to the town to assist with filtration, but a new source is still needed.\n\nThe move has the full support of NSW Water Minister Melinda Pavey who even suggested it as solution for other towns in dire need of a new water source.\n\nTenterfield is currently sweating through its driest year since 1915 and with a lack of rainfall comes bushfires - two have torn through the town in the last month alone.\n\nNeville Smith, a volunteer firefighter, recently suffered terrible burns to his arm in a fire that destroyed four homes in the town.\n\nMaking matters worse, the ash from the fire then rests on Tenterfield Shire's water supply dam, where it clogs the already struggling filtration system.\n\nThe CEO said the town's 4,000-plus residents are brave enough to take the first step and start using recycled waste water but not all agree.\n\nWith record dry weather the town is also battling bush fires, with two tearing through the town in the last month\n\nMum of two Michelle Battersby said her family will continue to use bottled water over recycled water despite the lack of fluoride.\n\nHer eight-year-old daughter Kyla said: 'I don't like the idea of people's poo in my water,'\n\nThe town's mayor Peter Petty is tasked with convincing the town of the merits of recycled water and argues it will be cleaner than ever before.\n\n'If we can use water that we\u2019re otherwise wasting out of the sewerage treatment plant, and if that will get us through this drought, we need to,' he said.\n\nThe town desperately needs to locate more bore water to use during the estimated two-year construction time of the new filtration plant - but no sources have been found.", "description": "Tenterfield in far north NSW has 74 days worth of water and the local council is looking to introduce recycled waste water to replenish drinking supply but not all local residents are convinced.", "authors": ["Tom Place For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/16/19628850-0-image-a-7_1570893203690.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
