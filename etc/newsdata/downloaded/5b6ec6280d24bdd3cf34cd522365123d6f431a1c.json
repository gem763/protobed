(Photo: AP)\n\nSeemingly every region of the world has been breaking temperature records these days. The oceans absorb much of this heat, and it\u2019s threatening the world\u2019s corals.\n\nClimate change is largely responsible for this crisis \u2014 or ourselves because, y\u2019know, we caused this mess. Hawaii, in particular, is seeing its corals suffer this summer. Large parts of the islands and surrounding oceans just experienced their warmest summer on record compared to the historic average, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Corals are especially vulnerable to even minor increases in temperature. When the waters get too hot, corals expel their algae \u2014 which help them produce food \u2014 and they can eventually die.\n\nHowever, this bleaching extends far beyond Hawaii, Mark Eakin, a coordinator with NOAA\u2019s Coral Reef Watch, told Gizmodo. These high temperatures have put corals in regions from the Pacific to the Caribbean on alert. The impact stretches from north of Bermuda, through the Bahamas, and all the way to Honduras.\n\nThe last time coral bleaching happened at a global scale was during the 2014 to 2017 bleaching event. Reefs around the Samoas, Kiribati, Florida, the Caribbean and beyond suffered heavy losses. In 2015, sites in west Hawaii lost nearly 50 per cent of their coral cover, per Hawaii\u2019s Division of Land and Natural Resources.\n\nNow, scientists are seeing ocean temperatures rise dangerously again. Earlier this month, scientists announced a heat wave ramping up in the Pacific. It\u2019s the second-largest heat wave recorded in the Pacific Ocean. Many of the ocean\u2019s corals are still recovering from the damage they suffered under the 2014-17 heat wave, so the current one could be even more dangerous.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing that\u2019s driving it is climate change,\u201d Eakin said. \u201cAll of that heat has to go somewhere, and the heat that would ordinarily go into the atmosphere has been absorbed into the upper ocean.\u201d\n\nThis is bad. (Photo: AP)\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Pacific heat wave is only beginning. Eakin said climate models show that heat stress may continue through November. That\u2019s bad news for the corals, but it\u2019s also bad news for other marine life, such as whales, seals, and salmon. The heat can hurt the food web, including humans near the top of it.\n\nAround the world, more than half a billion people depend on reefs for food and income, as well as protection from hurricanes and storm surge. Without reefs, humans suffer.\n\nUnfortunately, as our world grows warmer and warmer, protecting reefs will become more difficult because they\u2019ll have a smaller chance of bouncing back. That\u2019s why many scientists are trying to breed \u201csuper corals,\u201d which are resilient corals that don\u2019t bleach as easily (or at all) during these events.\n\nThe hope is that by breeding and bringing more of these into the environment, corals can evolve to better withstand this increased heat. Then, just maybe, we won\u2019t lose coral entirely.\n\nIn the meantime, we\u2019ll have to wait and see how reefs fare after this year\u2019s bleaching event. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s ends more quickly than the last.", "description": "Seemingly every region of the world has been breaking temperature records these days.
