CPS support staff are also striking, and are represented by SEIU Local 73. CTU teachers have worked under an expired contract for more than 100 days.\n\nProud to support teachers & school staff braving the weather outside my district office. I'm happy to open my office so they can warm up. As they organize for better working conditions & resources for students, I urge the parties to continue negotiations. #IStandWithTeachers pic.twitter.com/ZrsWE4i8P1 \u2014 Congressman Chuy Garc\u00eda (@RepChuyGarcia) October 21, 2019\n\nThe strike has led to citywide closure of school hours, though buildings have stayed open to provide meals and safe areas for students to stay. The school district developed a contingency plan for students to be supervised by non-unionized staff, but there has been no academic instruction or after-school programming with the exception of Chicago\u2019s more than 100 charter schools, which are operating as scheduled.\n\n\u201cWe could end this within a couple days, but there would need to be a commitment on the mayor\u2019s part to do that,\u201d Sharkey told local reporters Monday in response to the letter.\n\nCTU took to Twitter on Monday to express frustration with Lightfoot\u2019s letter, saying: \u201cWhen we said \u2018put it in writing,\u2019 this isn\u2019t what we meant.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom lies about our salary, to her intransigence on makeup days, to cancelling classes Oct. 17 before delegates could convene, to chiding us about \u2018urgency\u2019 when she has yet to come to the table, to painfully obvious photo ops, to today\u2019s letter,\u201d the union tweeted Monday. \u201cAll bad.\u201d\n\nIt took a strike to get the district to agree to FOLLOW STATE LAW regarding Pre-K staffing ratios. CPS is under state oversight for special ed violations. That's just two reasons why we're out here. We can\u2019t trust them to do right by students if we go back without a contract. \u2014 ChicagoTeachersUnion (@CTULocal1) October 21, 2019\n\nThe union has primarily asked for smaller class sizes and more special education teachers, nurses and social workers, among other demands like fair pay and housing policies. The union said Sunday that the two sides have since the walkout made a tentative agreement for specific staff positions to support homeless students, and CTU got contractual language included that the district will follow Illinois law in maintaining a ratio of one adult for every 10 students in a pre-K classroom. Lightfoot also proposed investing about $2 million to get a nurse and a social worker in every school.\n\n\u201cIt should be expected to have a social worker and nurse in a school community. [Lightfoot] mocked us when we talked about the 20,000 homeless students in the system,\u201d CTU Vice President Stacy Davis previously told HuffPost. \u201cThe CPS has a history of segregation, and it has a history of inequity.\u201d\n\nLightfoot said at a press conference Monday that CTU is asking for too much money, and that the union is being unreasonable by continuing to strike despite the mayor proposing solutions to two of the biggest demands.\n\nLIVE: Mayor Lightfoot addresses members of the press https://t.co/hfzVqjZuh4 \u2014 Mayor Lori Lightfoot (@chicagosmayor) October 21, 2019\n\n\u201cBeyond what we\u2019ve put on the table, there is simply no more money,\u201d Lightfoot told reporters. \u201cWe can only agree to what we can afford. There are not unlimited resources to fund everything in a single contract that CTU wishes. The money on the table is all there is.\u201d", "description": "The Chicago Teachers Union rejected Lori Lightfoot's request to halt the strike during contract negotiations as the walkout reached its third school day.", "authors": ["Sanjana Karanth"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Gb6Emm8BO5dE8gDQhhDvKg--~B/aD0zMTIxO3c9NTM0OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dae2fe9200000571c506589.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
