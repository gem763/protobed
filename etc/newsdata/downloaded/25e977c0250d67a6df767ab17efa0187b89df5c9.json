But it's unclear whether anyone really wants what he\u2019ll be offering.\n\nMost Democrats consider them too weak. Most Republicans, long resistant to triggering their base or the gun lobby, fear Trump won\u2019t push them forcefully enough \u2014 leaving them hanging.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe two sides will begin jockeying over firearms legislation when lawmakers return to Capitol Hill next week, a fight expected to continue through the fall after a string of mass shootings this summer once again pushed the issue to the forefront in Washington.\n\nTrump's proposals will likely include expediting the death penalty for mass shooters, releasing troubled teenagers\u2019 previously sealed records to the background-check database after they become adults and requiring the FBI to notify local authorities when a potential buyer fails a background check, according to people familiar with the weekslong discussions.\n\nMissing from the list \u2014 at least right now \u2014 are changes that have become a rallying cry among Democrats in Congress and on the campaign trail, such as universal background checks for gun purchases.\n\nIn the weeks since two back-to-back mass shootings in Texas and Ohio left 31 people dead, White House staffers have been talking with congressional aides of both parties as well as advocacy groups to develop a list of policies for Trump to consider. The president said this week he received 29 proposals.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201908/388/1155968404_6069085468001_6069086876001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nMost of the proposals Trump is likely to support are not new, and several have failed in Congress, according to the people familiar with the discussions. There\u2019s a bill to strengthen the penalties against so-called straw purchasers, or people who buy guns for others who are not legally allowed to purchase a firearms. There\u2019s legislation to ban people on a terrorism watch list from buying guns. There\u2019s a proposal to increase penalties for those who lie on background-check forms.\n\n\u201cThere are any number of pieces of legislation that already exist that we\u2019re looking at,\u201d Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway said. \u201cHe is willing to do plenty that will actually prevent these. You can\u2019t just say, \u2018Do something.\u2019 You have to do something meaningful and measurable.\u201d\n\nTrump is also expected to back proposals that allow for the temporary removal of guns from those deemed a threat to themselves or others, backed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and for the records of minors to be released after they become adults, pushed by former Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah).\n\nChaffetz said in an interview that having additional information could have prevented some of the recent shootings, including one on Aug. 4 in Dayton in which the shooter had been suspended from high school after he made lists of students he wanted to kill and rape.\n\nChaffetz said he knew how to get his message across to the White House: He called one of Trump's top aides, published an op-ed on Fox News and then appeared on Fox News, the president\u2019s preferred station.\n\n\u201cIt would have impacted some of the mass shootings,\u201c he said of his proposal. \u201cA lot of these proposals would not have impacted mass shootings.\u201c\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

But many of the proposals he is considering would require additional records to be sent to the flawed National Instant Criminal Background Check System \u2014 and would not necessarily expand the number of people who would be checked. Already, federal and state agencies have failed to send millions of mental health and drug abuse records to the database.\n\n\u201cWe need that database fixed,\u201d said Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Second Amendment Foundation, which opposes further gun control legislation. \u201cIt\u2019s got significant problems that need to be fixed.\u201d\n\nThe National Shooting Sports Foundation, Inc., the trade association for the firearms industry, launched a digital ad campaign to push lawmakers to require more records be sent to the database. \u201cA background check is only as good as the records in the database,\u201d according to the ads.\n\nCongress passed legislation last year supported by Trump to increase penalties on agencies that don\u2019t report information to the database, which his aides say could have prevented the mass shootings in Charleston, S.C., Sutherland Springs, Texas and Aurora, Colo.\n\nBut the president\u2019s comments over the past month have continued to confuse lawmakers and advocates. At times, he appeared open to universal background checks for gun purchasers, but at other times he stressed the country's \u201cvery strong background checks\u201c and the need to focus on mental health treatment.\n\nThe House passed a bill requiring background checks on all purchases, even between family members, while the Senate has another version that pertains to gun shows and online sales. Republicans say they don\u2019t think either can pass the Senate, where their party has control, despite strong support from a majority of Americans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at a lot of things, and hopefully coming up with something that\u2019s bipartisan,\u201d Trump told reporters Wednesday. \u201cIt has to be bipartisan.\u201d\n\nPeople familiar with the weekslong discussions on both sides of the issue have become convinced that Congress will fail, again, to pass any new legislation, even after a weekend shooting left seven dead in Texas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been here before,\u201d said Katherine Phillips, federal affairs manager at Giffords, a group founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.) after she was shot and seriously wounded. \u201cThis is what happens every time.\u201d\n\nThe same pattern has played out time and time again: Congress considers action in the midst of a public outcry but can\u2019t reach a consensus before the issue fades until the next shooting.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said again this week that he would bring legislation to the floor for a vote if Trump takes the lead. \u201cI said several weeks ago that if the president took a position on a bill so that we knew we would actually be making a law and not just having serial votes, I\u2019d be happy to put it on the floor,\u201d McConnell told conservative talk show radio host Hugh Hewitt.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s recent comments made some who support gun restrictions worry that the president would defer to Congress after all. \u201cI think Congress has got a lot of thinking to do, frankly,\u201d he said over the weekend.\n\n\u201cOur best chance is that neither wants to stick their necks out,\u201d said Dudley Brown, president of the National Association for Gun Rights, which opposes new gun restrictions.\n\nDemocrats have been pushing Republicans to take up several proposals, including banning assault weapons, and could refuse to back the administration\u2019s proposals unless they receive more of what they want.\n\n\u201cThe gun violence problem is so big, we don\u2019t need small half measures,\u201d said Christian Hayne, vice president of policy for Brady, a group which supports increased firearms restrictions. \u201cWe are not going to be interested in weakened, watered-down versions.\u201d\n\nThe House has already passed a bill that would extend the time for conducting background checks on purchasers. Its Judiciary Committee will meet next week to take up several other bills, including a ban on both high-capacity magazines and gun ownership by people convicted of hate crimes.\n\nMichael Hammond, legislative counsel for Gun Owners of America, which opposes new gun restrictions, said it\u2019s possible Democrats may succeed in getting additional proposals passed with that strategy but he also said it may end up being \u201ca path to killing everything.\u201d", "description": "The president is considering tougher penalties for straw buyers, the death penalty for mass shooters and bringing more records to the background check database.", "authors": ["Anita Kumar"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c5/6e/1e2aed304feca24c966071bd2698/20190903-donald-trump-gaggle-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
