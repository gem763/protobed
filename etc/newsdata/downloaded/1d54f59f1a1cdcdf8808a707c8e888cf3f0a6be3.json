I want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason,\" he wrote.\n\nTrump's Republican aides have sought to turn the tables on Democrats pushing for his impeachment, insisting that the president was the true \"whistleblower\" as he had asked Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son for corruption.\n\n\"This individual is a saboteur trying to undermine a democratically elected government,\" Trump advisor Stephen Miller insisted on \"Fox News Sunday\".\n\n\"Getting to the bottom of a corruption scandal in Ukraine is in the American national interest.\"\n\nTrump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani - who has emerged as his point man in the Ukraine scandal - led the charge along with Miller in combative Sunday talk show appearances.\n\nBrandishing what he said were affidavits incriminating Biden's son Hunter over his work at a Ukrainian company, Giuliani said Trump was duty bound to raise the issue with Kiev.\n\n\"If he hadn't asked them to investigate Biden, he would have violated the constitution,\" Giuliani told ABC's \"This Week\", charging that \"Donald Trump was framed by the Democrats.\"\n\n'Honour your oath'\n\nThe Democratic-led House of Representatives launched an official impeachment inquiry last week accusing Trump of a \"mafia-like shakedown\" of Zelensky aimed at damaging Biden.\n\nTrump and his allies claim Biden, as Barack Obama's vice president, pressured Kiev to fire the country's top prosecutor to protect his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a gas company, Burisma Holdings, accused of corrupt practices.\n\nThose allegations have largely been debunked and there has been no evidence of illegal conduct or wrongdoing in Ukraine by the Bidens.\n\nBut a transcript of the July call shows Trump pushing for Kiev to revisit the matter, saying both Giuliani and US Attorney General Bill Barr would be in touch.\n\nFor Democrats, that amounted to a smoking gun, leading Speaker Nancy Pelosi to finally approve an impeachment process she opposed as a risky distraction from the 2020 battle.\n\nPelosi on Sunday called for Trump to \"speak the truth. Honor your oath of office to the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\n\"Don't make this any worse than it already is,\" she said.\n\nDemocrats have charged aggressively into the inquiry, ordering Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to turn over Ukraine-related documents and scheduling witness testimony.\n\nOn NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Schiff said he expected the whistleblower to testify \"very soon\" - with all precautions taken to protect their identity.\n\n'In harm's way'?\n\nCBS News released a letter from the whistleblower's lawyers to the acting director of national intelligence expressing concern that their \"client will be put in harm's way.\"\n\n\"We expect this situation to worsen and become even more dangerous,\" the letter said, calling for \"appropriate resources to ensure their safety\".\n\nDemocrats have said articles of impeachment - formal charges - against Trump could be completed in as little as a month and swiftly voted on in the House, where the party has a majority.\n\nThe Biden campaign sent a letter Sunday to US TV networks to demanding they stop booking Giuliani for interviews, accusing him of \"knowingly and willingly\" lying.\n\nPolls suggest public support is growing for the impeachment inquiry, with a new CBS survey showing 55 percent of Americans - and nine in 10 Democrats - approve.\n\nBut even if impeachment is approved in the House, Trump would be tried in the Senate -- where, for the moment, he appears able to count on a Republican majority to prevent conviction.\n\n\n\n", "description": "US President Donald Trump has said he wants and deserves to meet the anonymous whistleblower at the centre of the fast-moving scandal that has triggered an impeachment probe against him.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9275/6dba4a314d174e5ba4cba978bda5fac7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
