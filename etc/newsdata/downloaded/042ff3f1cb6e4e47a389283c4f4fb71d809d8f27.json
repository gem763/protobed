There are Two James Bakers in this Movie", "language": "en", "text": "Is it possible that former FBI General Counsel James Baker has begun cooperating with Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham?\n\nRumors began swirling on Friday in Washington following OANN\u2019s Jack Posobiec\u2019s interview with Ned Ryun, who is the CEO and founder of American Majority.\n\nI\u2019ll give you the bottom line first. Toward the end of the segment, Posobiec said to Ryun, \u201cEssentially what you\u2019re saying is that Baker has flipped.\u201d\n\nRyun replied, \u201cI do believe that Baker has flipped based off my sources that have known and worked with Baker for years.\u201d\n\nThe two began with a discussion of the DOJ\u2019s announcement that Durham\u2019s administrative review had shifted to a criminal inquiry. Ryun said he has suspected for months this would happen. He also thinks that Durham probably convened a grand jury weeks and weeks ago.\n\nNote: Next, Posobiec speaks of James A. Baker, the former FBI General Counsel as the man who leaked the transcripts of General Flynn\u2019s phone calls with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.\n\nPosobiec says, \u201cIn this filing, Sidney Powell is stating that it was James Baker, the General Counsel of the FBI, and that the Washington Post ran it at the urging of James Clapper.\u201d\n\nThat is not true. He is confusing the two men. The filing clearly states that the man who allegedly leaked the transcript of Flynn\u2019s calls is Director Col. James H. Baker at ONA (Office of Net Assessment in the Pentagon). He is the one who regularly has lunch with Washington Post reporter David Ignatius who published the story. Below is a footnote from the Flynn filing which contains this information. (The full document can be viewed here).\n\nHouse Republicans revealed in January of this year that James A. Baker (FBI) was under a criminal investigation for leaks, just not the leak referred to in the Flynn filing.\n\nThen, Ned Ryun picks right up without saying, no it\u2019s really the James Baker from the Pentagon. Ryun says:\n\nI believe that James Baker was guilty of leaking\u2026But I\u2019ve talked with some high-level DOJ officials who worked with James Baker back in the day and they believe that he is probably witness number one for Durham and Barr, that he is actually providing evidence against others inside of this entire investigation. Because, let\u2019s not forget not only was he general counsel at the FBI, but he was also formerly the FISA guy at DOJ and I believe that he based a lot of what he did in the FISA process off trusting others. I feel that, according to these sources, that he has been used and abused and he is actually being helpful to Barr and Durham. I think he will have to bear the consequences for some of these actions that he, I believe, is guilty of. At the same time, I think he is being extremely helpful.\n\nTo make a long story short, it\u2019s entirely possible that one of these men have begun cooperating with Barr and Durham which would certainly be good news. Both are in legal jeopardy and both would have reason to do so. But no one really knows.", "description": "Rumors are Swirling that Former FBI Top Lawyer James Baker is Now Cooperating with Durham; The Problem?
