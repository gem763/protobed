The Senate Republican majority is not going to vote to convict the president and the country overwhelmingly doesn\u2019t want impeachment.\"\n\nOn his program, Sean Hannity argued that Democrats are setting a dangerous precedent.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening is dangerous to this country. It is grossly political, will forever alter how any president in the future -- in his constitutional role as commander-in-chief -- will be able to communicate freely with other world leaders. The world is less safe and secure tonight, as a result of yet the latest partisan witch hunt,\u201d Hannity said.\n\nHe continued, \u201c[M]ake no mistake this has nothing to do with Ukraine, this has nothing to do with collusion, this has nothing to do with high crimes and misdemeanors because there are none. This has very to do with the Left\u2019s unyielding, unhealthy, what is an obsessive-compulsive hatred of President Trump. They can\u2019t accept that he won\u2026And I think they even doubt that they can beat him at the ballot box, which is why they are trying to do this now\u2026It is a sickness but now it is officially hurting the country.\u201d\n\nWall Street Journal columnist Kimberly Strassel echoed Hannity's concern that Democrats are misusing the impeachment process.\n\nStrassel tweeted, \"Impeachment is meant to be the most serious of tools; not a means of reversing an election...\"\n\nTucker Carlson said that he believes Democrats are focused on bringing down Trump instead of concentrating on \u2013 what he deems -- to be the country's most pressing challenges.\n\n\u201c[Democrats] have a lot of energy. Too bad none of it is focused on the country\u2019s real problems\u2026 our national debt is exploding\u2026 we have a War in Afghanistan that we can\u2019t seem to win or end, our towns outside the big cities are being decimated and desiccated by opioids and suicide\u2026 we have basically an open border with Mexico, tech companies trying to control our freedom of speech\u2026 in many ways, the country is on the wrong track and people know it\u2026 But instead of trying to fix any of that Democrats want to spend the next year explaining \u2013 and they plan to \u2013 explaining why it was perfectly fair for Joe Biden\u2019s ne\u2019er-do-well son to get $600,000 a year from Ukrainian oligarchs\u2026 but it\u2019s somehow criminal for Donald Trump to ask about that,\u201d argued Carlson.\n\nWH TO RELEASE DOCUMENT SHOWING INTEL COMMUNITY IG FOUND WHISTLEBLOWER HAD 'POLITICAL BIAS', SOURCE SAYS\n\nTo watch all of \"Primetime Highlights\" visit Fox Nation and join today.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\n\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but only for Fox Nation subscribers.
