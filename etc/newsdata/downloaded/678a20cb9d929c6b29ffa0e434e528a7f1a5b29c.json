In short, it shows this whole Democratic debacle is nothing more than political games and their latest attempt to remove a lawfully elected sitting president of the United States. But, as Townhall readers probably know, the mainstream media will twist it any way they can to make Trump look bad and push the nation towards impeachment.\n\nHere is what Katie reported and some portions of the phone call:\n\nThe text was taken down by note takers. The call took place in July from the White House Situation Room. It shows no effort by President Trump to pressure Zelensky into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, in exchange for military aid. This action was falsely alleged by a whistleblower and pushed Democrats on Capitol Hill into an impeachment inquiry. In fact, military aid isn\u2019t mentioned at all. \"There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General [Barr] would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it...It sounds horrible to me,\" Trump said. \"I wanted to tell you about the prosecutor. First of all I understand and I'm knowledgeable about the situation. Since we have won the absolute majority in our Parliament, the next prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate, who will be approved by the parliament and will start as a new prosecutor in September. He or she will look in to the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue. The issue of investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and will work on the investigation of the case,\" Zelensky replied. \"I'm sure you will figure it out. I heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor so good luck with everything. You have a lot of assets. It's a great country. I have many Ukrainian friends, their [they're] incredible people,\" Trump said.\n\nBut, here is how the Washington Post decided to characterize the call via their headlines. \"Transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian president shows him offering U.S. assistance for Biden investigation.\"\n\nWhy is that bad? Let's turn over to Human Events' Will Chamberlain.\n\n\"So misleading Transcript shows Trump offering Barr\u2019s help *to assist* with the Biden investigation NOT a quid pro quo, as this deceptive headline suggests These people are addicted to fake news,\" Chamberlain tweeted in reaction to WaPo's piece.\n\nSo misleading\n\n\n\nTranscript shows Trump offering Barr\u2019s help *to assist* with the Biden investigation\n\n\n\nNOT a quid pro quo, as this deceptive headline suggests\n\n\n\nThese people are addicted to fake news https://t.co/8WAfSIYgky \u2014 Will Chamberlain (@willchamberlain) September 25, 2019\n\n\"Trump offered AG Barr\u2019s assistance *with* the investigation Not a quid pro quo *for* an investigation Massively fake news,\" he further clarified.\n\nNonetheless, CNN's Susan Hennessy is saying that the transcript \"does not merely warrant impeachment and removal. It demands impeachment and removal. It is an abuse of office and a violation of the law and an offense against the Constitution.\"\n\nAgain Chamberlain took her to task on this, saying, \"I assume you\u2019re referring to Biden bragging about getting a Ukrainian prosecutor fired While that prosecutor was investigating the company paying 50k a year to Biden\u2019s son?\"\n\nI assume you\u2019re referring to Biden bragging about getting a Ukrainian prosecutor fired\n\n\n\nWhile that prosecutor was investigating the company paying 50k a year to Biden\u2019s son?pic.twitter.com/Y95djVhwn1 \u2014 Will Chamberlain (@willchamberlain) September 25, 2019\n\nAnd so it goes. The Democrats and the leftist media will pluck and pull whatever they can to make Trump look bad and push for his impeachment.\n\nThe entire transcript can be read here:\n\nUnclassified Call Record - ... by Katie Pavlich on Scribd", "description": ".09/25/2019 19:27:19PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/262/3e21e979-a011-4840-b9c1-b9adfac48b16.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
