He has taught me a lot.\"\n\nTalking to TV2, Haaland added: \"I have dreamed of playing for the best clubs in the world my whole life, and I especially like English football.\"", "description": "Haaland is being tracked by clubs across Europe - and the race is set to hot up after he took his tally for the season to an astonishing 20", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Krugfoto Afp Via Getty Images", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20711568.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-EUR-C1-SALZBURG-NAPOLI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
