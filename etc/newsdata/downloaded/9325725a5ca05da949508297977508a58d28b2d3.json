Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost argued the cities and counties suing drug companies have usurped state authority to take on the drug companies. Opening arguments in the trial are scheduled for Oct. 21.\n\nAD\n\nBut the appellate judges agreed with previous rulings that such a move would be a \u201cdrastic and extraordinary remedy\u201d made only in \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d such as a judge\u2019s clear abuse of power. Ohio did not meet that test, they said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe parties have conducted extensive discovery, filed numerous pleadings and, in some cases, reached settlements,\u201d judges Alan E. Norris, Eugene E. Siler and Karen Nelson Moore wrote in a short decision. \u201cIn view of these circumstances, we decline to exercise our discretion to deploy one of \u2018the most potent weapons in the judicial arsenal.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn a written statement, Yost\u2019s spokesman, Dave O\u2019Neil said the court \u201cdid not say the state\u2019s argument was incorrect or not valid, but that the issue should be addressed with the trial court. At this time, we are reviewing our options.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe upcoming trial in Cleveland pits two Ohio counties, Cuyahoga and Summit, against six drug companies in the first federal court test of whether drug companies should pay billions of dollars to help clean up the fallout from the nation\u2019s worst drug crisis.\n\nAD\n\nMore than 2,500 other counties, cities, Native American tribes and other groups have sued dozens of companies over culpability for the epidemic, which has taken more than 400,000 lives in the past 20 years. Their lawsuits have been consolidated in the Cleveland courthouse of U.S. District Judge Dan Aaron Polster, in what is known as a \u201cmultidistrict litigation.\u201d\n\nPolster selected the two counties\u2019 lawsuits as a test case of how other jurisdictions might fare in their effort to secure payments from the drug industry.\n\nAD\n\nLast month, Polster declined a request by some of the drug companies to step aside. The companies alleged he showed bias toward settling the case. The drug companies appealed, but the appellate court said Thursday that he does not have to disqualify himself.\n\n\u201cJudge Polster equally placed blame on all parties, readily acknowledged that settlement efforts might not work, and acknowledged that both sides had compelling arguments,\u201d they wrote.\n\nAD\n\nThey added that \u201cwhile we may not have chosen to make the statements, grant the interviews, or participate in the programs that form the basis for this petition, particularly in a case of such enormous public interest and significance, and while we do not encourage Judge Polster to continue these actions,\u201d those actions do not require the judge\u2019s recusal.\n\nAD", "description": "The state of Ohio sought a delay, arguing the cities and counties that brought the lawsuits are usurping state authority.", "authors": ["Lenny Bernstein", "Reporter Covering Health"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ntG2FhoVuP8SLNrbbiATPFe5EX0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RDGOU2XLPEI6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
