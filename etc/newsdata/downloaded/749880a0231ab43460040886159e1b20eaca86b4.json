This is the lowest level for the index since July 2015.\n\nThe results of the survey of 1,200 people will be a concern for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which has cut interest rates to a record low 0.75% in part to support consumer demand.\n\n\"Typically, an interest rate cut boosts confidence particularly around consumers\u2019 expectations for and assessments of their own finances,\" said Westpac Chief Economist Bill Evans.\n\n\"In this survey these components of the index fell by 3.7% and 4.9% respectively. This may be because, despite the rate cut, assessments for the economy overall plunged by 6% (the twelve month outlook) and 9.1% (the five year outlook),\" he added.\n\n\"Consumers are looking behind the reason for the rate cut and, arguably, the absolute level of rates and getting nervous.\"", "description": "Australia consumer sentiment plunges to four-year lows in October", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF971Y0_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
