Mattis pointed out that Donald Trump had also said that Meryl Streep is an overrated actress. CNN showed the clip of the former Defense Secretary mocking the current commander in chief. The four-star general received much laughter after his comments and this may set a trend.\n\nAs republicans begin standing up against the president, more may join their ranks. Pulling U.S. troops out of Syria has caused Franklin Graham, Pat Robertson, and other evangelicals to cry foul, and more may follow their lead.\n\nDonald Trump losing support\n\nSlowly but surely, Donald Trump is losing support from his base. Congress, for the most part, remains loyal, but Evangelicals have been defecting ever since the president left the Kurds in harm's way.\n\nIf the trend continues he may stand no chance at winning re-election in 2020. General James Mattis openly mocking the commander in chief is very telling.\n\nDonald Trump's abuse of power will hurt him\n\nThe constant abuses of power that come from the Trump administration are astounding. Rudy Guiliani refusing to comply with subpoena's, denying, admitting and then denying, guilt on many issues is going to hurt \"The Donald\" in the long run.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news! Click on the topic you interest most. We'll keep you updated with all the news you shouldn't miss. Donald Trump\n\nJames Mattis speaking out will lead to another, which will cause one more to come forth. I believe it will soon be like the \"Me too\" movement.\n\nIt is time for the republicans in congress to put the nation ahead of their fragile egos. So what if they are mentioned in a tweet? They should suck it up and be brave like General James Mattis and turn it into a joke and move on.", "description": "The president continues to lose support and this may negatively impact his chances of being re-elected.", "authors": ["Ramon Sanchez", "Jane Flowers", "Read More On The Same Topic Cheryl Preston", "Kate Middleton Follows In Diana'S Footsteps", "Dons A Tiara For A Really Great Cause", "Former Obama U.N.
