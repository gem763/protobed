But what\u2019s seldom mentioned, and is most important: Bolton\u2019s departure won\u2019t change Trump\u2019s foreign policy.\n\nTrump was, is and no doubt will remain the decider-in-chief. There have been many so-called Trump-whisperers. There has never been one whose advice was always taken by the president.\n\nTrump has never had \u2014 and never wanted \u2014 a staff that says only \u201cyes sir.\u201d He seeks out a diversity of opinion, often reaching beyond his formal staff. That\u2019s why he brought on Bolton, who is far more hawkish than the president is, in the first place.\n\nNor is Trump dogmatic. On a number of policy challenges, including those posed by Syria and Afghanistan, deliberations with his advisers led him to take a different tack than what he initially intended.\n\nSo, there\u2019s no reason to expect swings in foreign policy now that Bolton is out the door. When Tillerson, Mattis, McMaster and Kelly were senior advisers, some claimed they led an \u201caxis of adults\u201d that oversaw foreign policy. Yet, all of them are long gone, and today\u2019s policies don\u2019t look all that different.\n\nThis is not to say that Bolton didn\u2019t have a positive impact. On his watch, real strides were made in moving Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy forward.\n\nBolton was an unbridled champion of the maximum pressure campaign waged against Tehran after the US pulled out of the Iran Deal. That campaign is working.\n\nThe Iranians are scrambling, trying to figure out how to get out from under Trump\u2019s thumb. There is even talk they might agree to meet with Trump around the UN General Assembly meeting in New York.\n\nBolton was a cheerleader for the US embracing Boris Johnson in his battle to Brexit from the European Union. And, there is no question that he gave some advice to the president in Hanoi, when North Korea\u2019s Dear Leader Kim tried to sucker Trump into a bad deal.\n\nHe was also right about telling the Taliban where to get off after it pulled a terrorist attack in Kabul on the eve of closing a \u201cpeace\u201d deal.\n\nYet, in the end, the president felt like the partnership just wasn\u2019t working anymore. For Trump, breaking up is never hard to do \u2014 because not much changes.", "description": "Heads are spinning in Washington over the sudden\u00a0departure of national security adviser John Bolton.
