REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nHis comments come as Chinese brands withdrew support for the NBA team and U.S. politicians and NBA fans voiced concern about the league\u2019s commitment to freedom of speech.\n\nIn an open letter to \u201cNBA fans\u201d posted on his personal Facebook page, Tsai wrote that he felt the need to speak about the issue as someone who had spent his professional life in China.\n\n\u201cSupporting a separatist movement in a Chinese territory is one of those third-rail issues, not only for the Chinese government, but also for citizens of China,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThe one thing that is terribly misunderstood, and often ignored, by the western press and those critical of China, is that 1.4 billion Chinese citizens stand united when it comes to the territorial integrity of China and the country\u2019s sovereignty over her homeland. This issue is non-negotiable,\u201d he added.\n\nTsai went on to note the Opium Wars and Japan\u2019s invasion of China as historical examples for why the Chinese psyche has \u201cheavy baggage\u201d toward threats to sovereignty.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Daryl personally. I am sure he\u2019s a fine NBA general manager, and I will take at face value his subsequent apology that he was not as well informed as he should have been. But the hurt this incident has caused will take a long time to repair,\u201d wrote Tsai.\n\nTsai was born in Taiwan, holds a Canadian passport and went to high school and university in the United States.\n\nTsai was a key dealmaker early in Alibaba\u2019s rise as China\u2019s largest e-commerce platform, and now serves as its executive vice chairman. He completed the purchase of a 49% stake in the Brooklyn Nets in 2018 and bought the remaining shares of the company last month.\n\nAlibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe recent wave of protests in Hong Kong originated as a means to oppose a now-withdrawn extradition bill.\n\nThey have since continued as demonstrators express concern over Beijing\u2019s perceived increasing influence over the city, which they feel violates the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d status the city was promised when Britain handed it over to the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1997.", "description": "Joseph Tsai, owner of the Brooklyn Nets and co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, said that the damage from Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey's tweet in support of Hong Kong's protesters \"will take a long time to repair.\"", "authors": ["Josh Horwitz", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437946727&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9607P", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
