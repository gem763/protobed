New Jersey legalized sports betting last year, following a Supreme Court ruling that allowed such moves by individual states.\n\nPlace Your Bets A state-by-state look at where sports betting is allowed or being considered.

Many are attempting to strike a balance between online and mobile gambling versus in-person wagering at casinos and racetracks.\n\nSome state lawmakers tout the convenience of betting on smartphones, while others are concerned that easy access could lead to an increase in problem gambling.\n\nIn Rhode Island, which launched in-person sports betting at its two casinos last year, and then expanded a few months later to mobile, legislators debated the pros and cons of the technology.\n\n\u201cThis can be done in your basement,\u201d said state Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a Democrat, during a floor debate on mobile betting. \u201cThis could be done while you\u2019re sitting next to your spouse in the very same room\u2026This is something that people are going to be able to do under the radar until it\u2019s a major problem for them.\u201d\n\nState Senate President Dominick Ruggerio countered that without mobile betting, wait times at physical locations could be prohibitive. Last November, he said, before Rhode Island began allowing mobile betting, sports gamblers at the two casinos got frustrated by long lines and sometimes missed out on bets while waiting.\n\n\u201cThe line was out the door, around the corner,\u201d Mr. Ruggerio, a Democrat, said.\n\nSupporters said mobile sports betting is already widely available in the form of gray-market apps and offshore websites, and states might as well take control and tax the activity. The American Gaming Association has estimated the value of illegal bets made through neighborhood bookies and offshore sites at $150 billion annually.\n\nGoing Mobile More than four-fifths of the amount of money bet on sports in New Jersey in June 2019 was from online. Retail 17% Online 83%\n\n\u201cThis is a product that wants to live online, where a significant amount of its customer base wants to interact online, and it\u2019s a product that frankly makes more sense online,\u201d said Chris Grove, a managing director with consulting firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming.\n\nUnder the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, each state can set up its own betting system, but bets across state lines aren\u2019t permitted. Mobile apps can use a method known as \u201cgeofencing\u201d to keep betting action within a state\u2019s borders.\n\nTwelve states currently allow sports betting of some kind, with online or mobile gambling in five of them: New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Iowa and Nevada. Four states limit betting to physical locations. (In the remaining three, laws permit online betting but it hasn\u2019t launched yet.)\n\nMeasures to introduce sports betting are at various stages in numerous other states, some with more political support than others.\n\nNew Jersey sports bettors wagered a total of $3.2 billion in the first year, with $2.4 billion of that coming in through mobile phones and computers, according to state data.\n\nThe online market is dominated by DraftKings Inc. and FanDuel Inc.\u2014rivals best known for fantasy-sports offerings that in some respects resemble betting.\n\nA sportsbook at Bally's casino in Atlantic City, N.J.

Mississippi projected the state would receive about $5 million from taxes on sports betting; the first year brought in under $4 million, said Allen Godfrey, the Mississippi Gaming Commission\u2019s executive director. Gamblers in the state can use a mobile app while inside a casino.\n\nTennessee, which has no casinos, is expected to be the first state to test an online-only sports-betting system, though it hasn\u2019t set a start date.\n\nA flurry of deals among gambling companies for online expansion have emerged in the past year. Caesars Entertainment Corp. signed a deal with DraftKings giving the smaller company access to Caesars markets, including casinos in 13 states. DraftKings will promote Caesars as its official casino partner and give it equity, according to the companies, while Caesars can continue to offer its own betting and online casino apps.\n\nMGM Resorts International recently made public a partnership with Boyd Gaming Corp. to expand mobile and online gaming across the combined 15 states where the two companies are licensed.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Would you prefer to bet on your favorite team in person at a casino, or via smartphone? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe sports-betting business offers operators slim margins\u2014on average about 5% of money wagered, before expenses, according to Scott Butera, MGM president of interactive gambling. Even so, the industry will continue to grow over the next two years, driven by mobile technology, Mr. Butera said.\n\n\u201cIt actually helps the casino business quite a bit because there\u2019s a lot of crossover between table room players and sports bettors,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not different from other businesses. To do any form of retail well in this economy, you have to have a really good mobile presence and a really good retail presence. They enhance each other.\u201d\n\nWrite to Katherine Sayre at katherine.sayre@wsj.com", "description": "As betting with smartphones has rocketed New Jersey to the front of the pack in the sports-gambling race, limits in other states could hamper the nascent industry\u2019s growth.", "authors": ["Katherine Sayre"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103318/social"}
