The occasion deserves to be marked by a party.\n\nBut how can you plan a national send-off if no one knows for sure when it\u2019s going to happen?\n\nBrexit party planners have been burned before. So far, the British government has renegotiated its deadline with the EU twice, moving it from March to April, then to Oct. 31. Party planning revved up. Then Parliament wrested control of the process from Prime Minister Boris Johnson, ordering him to delay Brexit unless he hashes out an arrangement with the EU.\n\nUndeterred, Growlers & Cans, a pub southwest of London in Guildford, slapped a warning on its Oct. 31 Halloween/Brexit party invitation: \u201cDisclaimer: Growlers & Cans by no means guarantees Brexit will have actually happened by this date!\u201d\n\nEvent organizer Charlie Martin said the pub is stocking up on Italian and German beer in preparation for the bash.\n\nThe King\u2019s Head plans to hand out Boris Johnson masks at its party.

Both nights were thwarted by government delays.\n\n\u201cPeople lost trust in the U.K. and in the event,\u201d said Charlotte \u00c5gren, the group\u2019s founder, who won\u2019t be organizing a third party for October.\n\nThe Old Nun\u2019s Head pub in London planned a \u201cU.K. Leaving Drinks\u201d back on March 29. When the U.K. pushed back that deadline, the pub didn\u2019t follow suit.\n\n\u201cWe promised a Brexit party, so we delivered what the government couldn\u2019t,\u201d said pub manager Nick McNeill. A DJ played European music for four hours, including lots of ABBA, a group that hailed from EU member Sweden.\n\nThe Old Nun's Head went ahead with a Brexit party in March even though the government pushed back the deadline. Photo: Nick McNeill\n\nThe U.K. didn\u2019t leave anywhere that day, so the turnout was disappointing. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure if we\u2019ll host another one,\u201d said Mr. McNeill. \u201cWe\u2019re undecided, because we\u2019ve been burned in the past.\u201d\n\nOther planners are convinced the Oct. 31 deadline is different.\n\n\u201cThis time feels a bit more certain, although we still don\u2019t know what Brexit will look like,\u201d said Virginie Clerk, the organizer of London cabaret show Soiree Pompette. She has scheduled a special performance for Oct. 31 called Brexit: Encore Une Fois!, or Brexit: Once Again!\n\n\u201cWe were poised for the deadline in March. We had a countdown on the night before\u2014it was meant to be like the last days of Rome,\u201d recalled Ms. Clerk. \u201cIf it is delayed again, we will keep going. It just adds to the absurdity. There\u2019s something absurd about our cabaret, and there\u2019s something bloody silly about Brexit.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts Would you attend a party for a major geopolitical event? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe King\u2019s Head, a pub in the southeastern England town of Deal that has been in business since the mid-1600s, is more confident in the government\u2019s promise to deliver by Halloween. The pub, which has a newspaper clipping on the wall about a visit from Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, plans to hold \u201cBoris\u2019s Big Brexit Bash\u201d on Nov. 1.\n\nThe pub intends to hand out Boris Johnson masks and serve a free shot to any patron who comes dressed as the prime minister, presumably in a rumpled suit with tousled hair. \u201cWe\u2019re real Boris fans,\u201d said Jamie Cavell, the pub\u2019s manager.\n\nBrexit Party leader Nigel Farage, center, stopped at the King\u2019s Head when he visited Deal.

And I thought: whatever they can do, we can do better,\u201d said Stu Cohen, who is organizing a beach party in Norfolk, a region in England that voted \u201cleave.\u201d He plans to mark the occasion with fireworks and fish and chips.\n\n\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t happen, we\u2019ll do another one until it does,\u201d said Mr. Cohen.\n\nMembers of Leavers of Britain, a network of pro-Brexit voters, are holding off until they feel more confident in the government\u2019s ability to deliver on Halloween.\n\nOld Nun\u2019s Head pub in London is undecided about whether to hold another Brexit party. Photo: Nick McNeill\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re used to having to organize things with fairly short notice,\u201d said Paul Hepden, a volunteer coordinator at the Leavers of Bristol group.\n\nThe governing Conservative Party maintains Brexit will happen on Oct. 31 despite it losing its parliamentary majority. The government noted in September that only half of the population believed Brexit would actually happen by Halloween.\n\nSome party planners remain steadfast. The Conservatives of the Arundel and South Downs constituency north of London will host \u201cThe Great British Brexit Celebration\u201d on Nov. 1.
