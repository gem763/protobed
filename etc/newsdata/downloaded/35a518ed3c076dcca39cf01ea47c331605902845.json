More than the number, it is the profiles of these men and women booked for sedition that make the case, well, laughable. Among those on the \u2018hit list\u2019 are historian Ramachandra Guha and filmmakers Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Mani Ratnam, Shyam Benegal, Aparna Sen, and Anurag Kashyap.\n\nThat most of them work in the sphere of arts and culture should speak something about the character of whoever came up with the brilliant idea to get them booked. For the record, the FIR came after chief judicial magistrate Surya Kant Tiwari passed an order two months ago on a petition filed by a lawyer named Sudhir Kumar Ojha.\n\nHere are some highlights from the letter which the magistrate found fit to be considered as chargeable for sedition, public nuisance, hurting religious feelings and insulting with an intent to provoke breach of peace.\n\nThe lynching of Muslims, dalits and other minorities must be stopped immediately.\n\nRegrettably, \u2018Jai Sri Ram\u2019 has become a provocative war cry today that leads to law and order problems. It is shocking that so much violence should be perpetrated in the name of religion.\n\nThere is no democracy without dissent. People should not be branded \u2018anti-national\u2019 and \u2018urban naxal\u2019 or incarcerated because of dissent against the government.\n\nCriticising the ruling party does not mean criticising the nation.\n\nAn open environment where dissent is not crushed only makes for a stronger nation.\n\nIf any of those points constitutes sedition or public nuisance, many of our great leaders including Mahatma Gandhi \u2013 if alive today \u2013 would\u2019ve found it difficult to avoid litigation. In fact, many of them were jailed during their times because of dissent. If today\u2019s powers that be choose to be no different from the British in employing tools of oppression, they should also expect an uprising similar to those against our erstwhile oppressors.\n\nThe self-appointed custodians of invented nationalism have so far found comfort in the silence of the tolerant. But that may not last long. If every citizen who believes in dissent and tolerance reproduces the \u2018letter of 49\u2019 and posts it to the Prime Minister, India Post will no longer be in the red.\n\nBut symbolism doesn\u2019t work with the insensitive. Arab Spring didn\u2019t happen in an instance, though the social media accelerated its reach. At the heart of every Occupy movement has been the respect and love for democracy and dissent. Strong-arm tactics and hit jobs on people who refuse to sing the chorus of distorted nationalism will push India to a movement of resistance and reclamation of rights.\n\nAnd such a struggle will not be confined to social media, where trolls \u2013 by the paid and the paranoid \u2013 have been able to force people like Anurag Kashyap out of Twitter. Besides hashtags and handles, there will be people on the streets.\n\nThe case against the 49 who wrote to the Prime Minister may not stand judicial scrutiny, and none of them cares a damn about such paper tigers, but that our laws can be used as an instrument of threat against dissent is worrisome. What makes one sadder is that the by-product of such systemic attempt at building a monolithic nationalism is feeding and breeding intolerance. The mails I would get for this column will bear testimony to this.\n\nTo troll me, wait for the online version of this column on my Twitter handle @Arun_ Ram. Please send your threats and abuses to my email mentioned below. The best of them will be published on this page.", "description": "The Indian state has added 49 more people to its \u2018anti-national\u2019 list for writing a letter to the Prime Minister.
