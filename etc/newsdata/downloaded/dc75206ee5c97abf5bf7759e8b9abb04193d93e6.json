REUTERS/Zohra Bensemra\n\nDAKAR (Reuters) - Senegal President Macky Sall has pardoned one of his chief political rivals, the charismatic former mayor of Dakar, Khalifa Sall, who was jailed in 2018 on corruption charges.\n\nKhalifa Sall, who is no relation to the president, was arrested in March 2017 on suspicion of embezzling 1.8 billion CFA francs ($3 million) in public funds. Last year, he was sentenced to five years in jail.\n\nHe was pardoned with two others, according to a statement from the Presidency on Sunday. Khalifa Sall\u2019s lawyers confirmed the decision.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a salutary decision since he was arbitrarily imprisoned, but the fight is not over. We want an amnesty,\u201d said Khalifa Sall\u2019s lawyer, Ousseynou Fall.\n\nWith four largely peaceful transitions of power since independence from France in 1960, Senegal is seen as a beacon of democratic stability in a restive region.\n\nYet the president\u2019s political opponents saw Khalifa Sall\u2019s imprisonment as a political hit job based on false charges to keep one of the country\u2019s best-known and popular politicians out of a presidential election that Macky Sall won decisively in February this year.\n\nMacky Sall has denied such charges, but his treatment of Khalifa Sall raised questions among international observers about the president\u2019s dedication to free and fair elections.", "description": "Senegal President Macky Sall has pardoned one of his chief political rivals, the charismatic former mayor of Dakar, Khalifa Sall, who was jailed in 2018 on corruption charges.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435295036&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S0SE", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
