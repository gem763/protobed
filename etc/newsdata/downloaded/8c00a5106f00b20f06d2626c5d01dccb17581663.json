(Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)\n\nTime doesn\u2019t heal all wounds.\n\nShaquille O\u2019Neal was one vote short of being named a unanimous MVP in 1999-2000 while with the Los Angeles Lakers. He had 121 of 122 possible votes, the highest percentage of any MVP in league history at the time.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe lone holdout was Fred Hickman, then with CNN, and O\u2019Neal hasn\u2019t forgotten or lost those feelings about it. Kristine Leahy could barely get the question out during a Monday segment on her FOX Sports show \u201cFair Game.\u201d\n\nSo excited to have @SHAQ on the show with me today, tomorrow and Wednesday. We talked about SO much - here\u2019s Shaq discussing being one vote shy from unanimous MVP. Couldn\u2019t even finish my sentence... pic.twitter.com/4ZufnAviC8 \u2014 Kristine Leahy (@KristineLeahy) September 23, 2019\n\n\u201cFred Idiot Hickman,\u201d O\u2019Neal said. \u201cI hate him. I don\u2019t need to talk to him. There\u2019s nothing to apologize about. Because he destroyed history being a (expletive).\u201d\n\nO\u2019Neal led the league with an average 29.7 points and 57.4 percent field-goal percentage. He was second in rebounds with an average 13.6 per game and third in blocked shots with 3.03. He was the first player since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar did it in 1976-77 to finish top three in the all of the categories.\n\nHickman voted for Allen Iverson of the Philadelphia 76ers. He averaged a second-best 28.4 points, though he shot 42.1 percent from the field and was 20th in player efficiency rating (O\u2019Neal was 10 points ahead in first).\n\nStory continues\n\nO\u2019Neal told Leahy there \u201cwasn\u2019t anybody close\u201d to him in terms of play that season and that Hickman knew what he was doing. He then compared it to Golden State Warriors\u2019 Stephen Curry earning the league\u2019s first unanimous MVP in 2015-16.\n\n\u201c[Hickman] messed up history. And then a couple years later he\u2019s going to give Steph Curry unanimous? I love Steph; Steph\u2019s my favorite guy. He knows that. But c\u2019mon.\u201d\n\nIt was Curry\u2019s second consecutive MVP and he won all 131 votes. O\u2019Neal isn\u2019t the only player to miss a unanimous title by one vote. The Boston Globe\u2019s Gary Washburn gave his vote to Carmelo Anthony in 2013, nixing a unanimous decision for LeBron James.\n\nO\u2019Neal won three titles with the Lakers. Iverson won the 2000-2001 MVP, taking 93 of 124 first-place votes. Hickman won a Sports Emmy in 2004 and has worked for various broadcasters.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Time doesn't heal all wounds.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ADeExbTtyOeG463Gup_u1w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MDEuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Cn9sSHaVjCjlYeLNlb4mbQ--~B/aD0yNDY0O3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/b9cf81b0-de43-11e9-8bf6-9748850a614b", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
