Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) speaks during a luncheon at the National Press Club in Washington in August 2019. Cummings, a sharecropper's son who rose to become the powerful chairman of one of the U.S. House committees leading an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump, died Oct. 17, 2019, of complications from longstanding health issues. He was 68.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The opinions in this article are the author\u2019s, as published by our content partner, and do not necessarily represent the views of MSN or Microsoft.\n\nElijah E. Cummings, a Democrat, represented Maryland\u2019s 7th Congressional District until his death Oct. 17.\n\nThis op-ed is adapted from a foreword that Cummings wrote July 17 for the forthcoming book, \u201cIn Defense of Public Service: How 22 Million Government Workers Will Save Our Republic,\u201d by Cedric L. Alexander.\n\nAs I pen these words, we are living through a time in our nation\u2019s history when powerful forces are seeking to divide us one from another; when the legitimacy of our constitutional institutions is under attack; and when factually supported truth itself has come under relentless challenge.\n\nI am among those who have not lost confidence in our ability to right the ship of American democratic life, but I also realize that we are in a fight \u2014 a fight for the soul of our democracy.\n\nAs an American of color, I have been able to receive an excellent public education, become an attorney, and serve my community and country in both the Maryland General Assembly and Congress because of one very important fact: Americans of conscience from every political vantage point took our Constitution seriously and fought for my right to be all that I could become.\n\nSubscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today\u2019s most popular stories on The Washington Post\n\nThis is the personal debt that I and so many others with my heritage owe to our democratic republic \u2014 to the 20-million-plus Americans who serve our republic and its values in our nation\u2019s civil service.\n\nAnd this is also why I, personally, will remain in the fight to preserve our republic and the humane and equitable values at its foundation for as long as I can draw breath.\n\nIt was to our Constitution \u2014 and not to any political perspective or party \u2014 that I gave my oath when I became an officer of the court, when I joined the Maryland legislature and when I was elected to serve in Congress.\n\nIt is this commitment that I bring to my work as chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, the committee that has direct oversight over our federal civil service. From my more than two decades of experience performing this oversight, I can confirm that our nation\u2019s federal employees deserve our respect, gratitude and support.\n\nWhen people in the leadership of the nation attack our courts, the members of our Congress, our civil servants and our media, they are attacking the glue that holds our diverse nation together as the United States of America.\n\nAnd when these attackers do so on the basis of factually unfounded opinion, rather than verifiable evidence, they are engaged in demagoguery of the most dangerous sort.\n\nThis is why our civil service, committed to maintaining the rule of law and decision-making based on verifiable facts, is so important to maintaining the legitimacy of our government, both elected and appointed.\n\nUnder our democratic republic, elected leaders make policy but must rely on civil servants, appointed on the basis of merit, to implement those public policies. We must rely on the expertise of our merit-based civil service if we wish to have a government that addresses the factual realities of our lives (to the extent that human beings can ever achieve that goal).\n\nThis duty to find and implement the truth, as I have mentioned, is the province of our civil servants, whether they serve in Washington; our states; or in the law enforcement agencies of our country. This is not to say that our government agencies always get it right or that they never overreach. Human beings, however talented and well-meaning, make mistakes.\n\nAs citizens of the greatest democratic republic in the world, we have the privilege and duty to recall our nation\u2019s founding and to engage our nation on the basis of those fundamental principles.\n\nI hold fast to this conviction because the functioning \u2014 indeed, the very legitimacy \u2014 of our democratic system has been under attack for some time. I am speaking, of course, of the continuing attacks on our elections \u2014 from sources both foreign and domestic \u2014 and of the failure of too many of my colleagues in Congress and the White House to adequately defend us against those attacks.\n\nFor the unity and future of our republic, our Congress must reassert its constitutional obligation of oversight, seeking and obtaining the answers to serious questions of governance that, until now, have gone unanswered. We must perform this constitutional duty so effectively and convincingly that those Americans who support this president and his administration and those who disagree will reach a shared and united answer as to how our nation must proceed.\n\nI remain confident that we can fulfill this historic duty. To succeed, however, we will need our federal civil service and the Americans who serve us there to give us their complete and unbiased cooperation. To the extent that we are required to do so, we will enforce that cooperation through action in our courts, but I sincerely hope that this route will seldom be necessary. Toward this end, I will close with this pledge. In the words of my heroine, former congresswoman Barbara Jordan, from 1974:\n\n\u201cMy faith in the Constitution is whole; it is complete; it is total. And I am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the diminution, the subversion, [or] the destruction of the Constitution. I hope and trust that all Americans feel \u2014 and will do \u2014 the same.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: The latest Trump challenge to an independent civil service\n\nNancy Pelosi: Elijah Cummings was our North Star\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: As long as he had breath, Elijah Cummings spoke out\n\nColbert I.
