His last film, \u201cThe Lost City of Z,\u201d journeyed into the Amazon, circa early 20th century. His latest, \u201cAd Astra,\u201d skitters across the solar system like a stone skipped through space.\n\nBoth films aren\u2019t merely changes in setting. They\u2019re inherently about leaving home - the sacrifice entailed, the wonders to be discovered, the cost of obsessions that require pursuit. It\u2019s fitting that they follow Gray\u2019s masterpiece, \u201cThe Immigrant,\u201d a profound and melancholic tale of passage. Whether orbiting New York or Neptune, Gray has been on the move for some time.\n\n\u201cAd Astra,\u201d starring Brad Pitt as an astronaut in the near future, is easily the most expensive production yet for Gray (\u201cWe Own the Night,\u201d \u201dTwo Lovers\u201d). Its timing is fortuitous. Coming on the heels of Pitt\u2019s radiant performance in \u201cOnce Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood,\u201d \u201dAd Astra\u201d seems almost like an encore amid all the (deserved) celebration of its lead performer, a singular star in a movie universe with few that can match his luster.\n\nBut \u201cAd Astra,\u201d more intimate than it is majestic, is much more than a rocket-fueled vehicle for its star. It\u2019s a ruminative, mythical space adventure propelled by father-son issues of cosmic proportions. Pitt\u2019s Roy McBride is ordered to the far reaches of the solar system to make contact with his previously presumed dead father, a legendary space explorer named H. Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones).\n\nHe\u2019s feared to have gone mad, and is suspected of having something to do with power surges playing havoc with Earth\u2019s electronics. In the film\u2019s staggering first moments, McBride is working on a miles-high antenna, like Jack on a beanstalk to the sky, when a surge sweeps over it. Explosions follow and McBride plummets through the stratosphere.\n\n\u201cAd Astra\u201d is mapped like \u201cApocalypse Now.\u201d (Gray is so devoted a Coppola fan that he ranks dinners by the director\u2019s oeuvre .) Instead of an ominous, top-secret trek down a Vietnamese river toward Colonel Kurtz, McBride is hopping between planetary stations (a string of colonized bases exist on the moon and Mars, with Neptune the next destination) en route to another missing hero-turned-psychopath, with a mission to potentially search and destroy. That this is Roy\u2019s father, whom he hasn\u2019t seen since he was a youngster, adds significantly to the implications of the journey.\n\nPitt\u2019s astronaut is a solitary figure, taciturn and cool under pressure. Much of the charisma he so effortlessly displayed in \u201cOnce Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood\u201d has gone into hiding, replaced with a more pensive and subtle performance. His space voyage comes in contact with a handful of colorful figures, all of them underused (Donald Sutherland, Natasha Lyonne, Ruth Negga, a pair of rabid space baboons). But Roy\u2019s chiefly in dialogue with himself and the old video transmissions from his father.\n\nIn copious amounts of voice over and frequent confessional-like psychological evaluations, Roy narrates his psychological voyage through the stars. \u201cI will not allow my mind to linger on that which is not important,\u201d he says early in the film, pledging his devotion to the mission. It\u2019s a line that will come to mean something else to Roy as he gets further and further from home (he leaves behind an ex-wife, played by Liv Tyler), and goes deeper and deeper into his - and his father\u2019s - obsessions. The nature of ambition gets deconstructed. Grandiosity gets toppled by elemental humanity.\n\nGray, of course, is only the most recent master-filmmaker to seek existential truths in the remoteness of space. There was Claire Denis\u2019 \u201cHigh Life\u201d earlier this year and Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cInterstellar\u201d in 2014. The latter bears some similar DNA with \u201cAd Astra.\u201d But Nolan lingered much more on the life and family left behind by its space traveler (Matthew McConaughey). Gray, a more restrained director, gives us little of Roy\u2019s earthly life, something that dulls the movie\u2019s emotional arc when Roy begins to look backward.\n\nWhere I think \u201cAd Astra\u201d misses the mark is in so closely marrying its subtext with its text. Roy is navigating his relationship to his absent father both literally and figuratively. Daddy issues, alone, can take you only so far, even if it\u2019s to Neptune. Aside from verging on the one-note, that focus constricts the very linear, very self-contained \u201cAd Astra,\u201d a taut but inflexible chamber piece in a genre given to symphony.\n\nThat minimalism, though, is also part of the considerable appeal of \u201cAd Astra.\u201d The placid surface of Pitt\u2019s carefully calibrated performance slowly cracks. And it\u2019s often riveting to watch how Gray remakes fairly familiar science-fiction terrain. Working with cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema (who also shot \u201cInterstellar\u201d), Gray brings his typically formalist style and firm command to stripped-down scenes that approach the sublime. A dazzling chase sequence with buggy-riding pirates on the moon is depicted nearly soundlessly.\n\nGray has a gift for shrinking massive set pieces and enlarging private dramas. In \u201cAd Astra,\u201d he travels 2.7 billion miles through space. It\u2019s a long way to go for a talk with your dad, but a fair distance for uncovering a ray of hope in a lifeless void.\n\n\u201cAd Astra,\u201d a 20th Century Fox release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for some violence and bloody images, and for brief strong language. Running time: 124 minutes. Three stars out of four.\n\n___\n\nMPAA Definition of PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned.
