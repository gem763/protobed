Around 2,400 people died.\n\nThe inquiry is chaired by former High Court judge Sir Brian Langstaff who at the beginning of the evidence session reiterated his promise to put people at the heart of the probe.\n\nHe said there was still time for witnesses to come forward and added: \u201cIf you have given a witness statement, and would like to be heard, do not, please, think at the end of this set of hearings that you have lost any chance of that.\n\n\u201cI promised to put people who have been infected, or affected by the suffering of others, not only first but also last.
