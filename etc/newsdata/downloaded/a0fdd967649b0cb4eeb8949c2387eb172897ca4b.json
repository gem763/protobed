It was the first decline in the past 10 quarters and the biggest since the third quarter of 2012.\n\nIn July-September, previously owned condos and co-ops in Manhattan sold for a median $US915,000, down 8 per cent from the year-earlier period. Bloomberg\n\n\"It's just more signs that the sellers are capitulating,\" Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, said in an interview. \"The market is going through what could be called a reset.\"\n\nDeclining sales over the past two years have sobered Manhattan's home-sellers, who now realize that the way to a deal is a markdown. In the three months through September, 93.6 per cent of all purchases were at or below the last asking price, the second-highest share since the end of 2011, Miller said. Many homes that sold at the asking price had gotten previous reductions.\n\nTake for example, the buyer of one Upper West Side co-op, who paid $US635,000 for the West End Avenue one-bedroom last month - or 9.2 per cent less than what the seller had asked when first listing it in January. There's also a one-bedroom condo in West Chelsea that sold in September for $US1.145 million - a 15 per cent reduction from its original listing price in June.", "description": "Falling sales over the past two years have sobered Manhattan's home-sellers, who now realise the best way to make a deal is a markdown.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2922%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/66e6e69a5046c00aa99ece62beb57eda960ca68c", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
