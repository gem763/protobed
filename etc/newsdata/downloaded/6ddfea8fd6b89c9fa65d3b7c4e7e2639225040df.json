The effort to condition something the Ukrainian president deeply sought, that is, a meeting with the president, to establish this new president to the Ukraine had a powerful patron in the United States that was vital importance to Ukraine, that was being conditioned as digging up dirt on the Bidens.\u201d\n\nHost Margaret Brennan sought to clarify if Schiff was saying he believed that simply agreeing to meet with Ukrainian President Zelensky was the quid pro pro, and not just the military aid. Democrats have alleged the president withheld millions in U.S. aid in exchange for help from the Ukrainians investigating the Bidens.\n\nBut Schiff then argued that there doesn\u2019t need to be any evidence of a quid pro quo for them to pursue impeachment.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, there doesn't need to be a quid pro quo,\u201d he responded, \u201cbut it is clear already I think from the text messages that this meeting that the Ukraine president sought was being conditioned on their willingness to interfere in the U.S. election to help the President. That is a terrible abuse of the President's power. Now whether that abuse goes further that is the withholding of military aid also as leverage.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nZelensky has said he did not even know the aid had been withheld at the time of his July phone call with Trump.", "description": ".10/14/2019 7:41:06AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/276/6a7d2689-a635-48fe-b48b-a7ac97b5f208.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
