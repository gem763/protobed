The spokesperson declined further comment on Boeing's ongoing lawsuits.\n\nBoeing's 737 Max jets were grounded worldwide in March after Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all 157 people on board. It came five months after the crash of Lion Air Flight 610, also a 737 Max, in October 2018. All 189 people on board were killed.\n\nThe company is facing multiple lawsuits and federal investigations related to the 737 Max, and it is unclear when the aircraft, which is Boeing's top-selling plane, will be cleared to fly again.\n\nSpeaking to an investors conference earlier this month, Muilenburg said that the 737 Max's return could come in phases . \"I think a phased ungrounding of the airplane amongst regulators from around the world is a possibility,\" he said.\n\nFederal Aviation Administration chief Stephen Dickson said Thursday that if other countries weren't prepared to unground when the FAA is, \"it may get to the point where we have to make our own decision.\"\n\nThe company has expressed hope the plane will be cleared for flight early in the fourth quarter, which begins in October.", "description": "Boeing will begin to pay $50 million in financial assistance to the families of more than 300 victims of the two 737 Max crashes, the company announced Monday.", "authors": ["Helen Regan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190923233510-02-et302-190910-restricted-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
