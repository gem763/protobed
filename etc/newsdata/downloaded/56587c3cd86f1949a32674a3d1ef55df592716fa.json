REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo\n\nIn more than a year of tweets to his nearly 65 million followers, Trump has blamed the Fed with sometimes personal attacks for squelching economic growth and the stock market, and tying his hands in trade negotiations with China.\n\nYet asked who is \u201cresponsible for the current state of the American economy,\u201d 44% said Trump had \u201ca great deal\u201d of responsibility, compared with 17% for the Fed.\n\nAmong the 4,174 survey respondents, only 9% said they felt the Fed makes decisions \u201cto intentionally hurt the president,\u201d while just 14% said the Fed was trying \u201cto intentionally help\u201d Trump in the decisions it makes about interest rates.\n\nWhile the survey results split slightly along party lines, even among Republicans only 13% said they felt the Fed was trying to damage the president with its policies, while 19% of Democrats thought the Fed was trying to help Trump.\n\nThat compares to 45% who said the Fed was acting neither to help nor hurt the president, a Republican, and a third who said they did not know.\n\nThe survey results are a potentially important sign for the central bank that the steady negative commentary from Trump hasn\u2019t undercut public support for a body of technocrats to oversee setting interest rates.\n\nAmong all respondents 55% said they felt interest rates \u201cshould be the responsibility of independent experts,\u201d while only 23% felt they should be set by elected officials. The figure was even higher, in excess of 60%, among Republicans in suburban and rural areas, arguably the core of Trump\u2019s electoral base.\n\nOverall 57% of respondents said they were \u201cvery familiar\u201d or \u201csomewhat familiar\u201d with the Fed, while only 6% of respondents said they had \u201cnever heard of it.\u201d\n\nGOOD NEWS FOR FED\n\n\u201cThose results are very good news for the Federal Reserve and affirm the public perception of it being independent and being non-partisan,\u201d said Nathan Sheets, a former Fed and U.S. Treasury official and currently chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income.\n\nPerhaps as significant for the Fed, which regards its credibility as central to its effectiveness, financial market participants \u201cwould have a broadly similar perspective,\u201d Sheets said.\n\nThat conclusion was supported in a separate Reuters poll of economists in which 80% of respondents said they did not think the Fed is influenced by Trump\u2019s criticism.\n\nFed officials regard their power to make independent decisions about interest rates as key to setting monetary policy that supports high employment and stable prices - the goals assigned to the central bank by Congress.\n\nThat can sometimes clash with what elected officials see as the best course of action, particularly when it comes to their reelection campaigns.\n\nThe reelection losses of Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1980 and Republican George Bush in 1992 were both blamed at least in part on tight Fed policy.\n\nTrump has demanded the Fed take a series of actions in recent months, including sharp interest rate reductions and the restart of crisis-era policies to stimulate economic growth.\n\nThe criticism has been particularly intense in recent weeks as Trump\u2019s trade war with China seemed to dampen economic growth more than anticipated ahead of a 2020 election campaign.\n\nThe Fed has cut interest rates twice this year, including this week, but has ignored the president\u2019s advice for more dramatic action.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t made the Fed fully independent in the public\u2019s eye: 46% of respondents said the Fed is \u201cinfluenced by politicians/politics.\u201d\n\nThe Reuters Ipsos poll was conducted online from Sept. 10 to Sept. 16 throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 4,174 adults and has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of two percentage points.", "description": "President Donald Trump's barrage of tweets blasting the U.S. Federal Reserve appears to have been ignored by both Republicans and Democrats who largely see the central bank as neutral in its decision making, according to results of a new Reuters Ipsos poll.", "authors": ["Howard Schneider", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431989846&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J0WG-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
