In fact, I predicted it during a hit on a radio show Wednesday morning, along with countless other pundits observing the train wreck developing around President Trump\u2019s call to Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky. (Perhaps this would all go more smoothly if the guy\u2019s name didn\u2019t sound so much like Voldemort.) The press and the public have their collective hands on the transcript of the call, with reporters almost wetting themselves, confident that they\u2019ve finally got the President in their sights and the impeachment hammer will be coming down any day now.\n\nBut what about the other participant on that call? As it turns out, Zelensky isn\u2019t pleased that all the details of his supposedly private conversation with the American president are scrolling across the chyron on CNN. (Associated Press)\n\nUkraine\u2019s president says his comments in a conversation with U.S. President Donald Trump shouldn\u2019t have been publicly released. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is also playing down Ukraine\u2019s investigation of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden\u2026 Zelenskiy told reporters at the U.N. General Assembly in New York afterward that \u201cI think such things, such conversations between heads of independent states, they shouldn\u2019t be published.\u201d But he also said he\u2019s \u201cnot afraid\u201d of the publication.\n\nThis choice to release the nearly full transcript (with minor redactions) was a bad decision, whether it originated in the White House or the press corps. Granted, some of the information in there was going to have to be handed over, at least to some members of Congress, if not the public. The allegations raised by the so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d were too incendiary to simply bury it and leave everyone guessing.\n\nBut basically emptying the bag is going to cost Donald Trump in the long run, and I\u2019m not talking about the Democrats\u2019 dreams of impeachment. Why would any other world leaders speak candidly with the President again after this? As Zelensky clearly pointed out, he expected the call to be a private one and now whatever dirty laundry was discussed is out in the public square.\n\nNone of it was too terrible for the Ukranian president. He did a bit of trash-talking about France and Germany, but it was relatively softball stuff involving a decision to build a new Russian pipeline. Thus far Macron and Merkel haven\u2019t commented on it, but you can bet their next interactions with Zelensky will be a bit awkward.\n\nMuch worse undoubtedly goes on during calls between all world leaders on a regular basis. Can you imagine what Trudeau, Merkel and Macron say about Trump when nobody is listening? But they expect that those conversations will remain among the participants. Also, proposals are regularly floated when leaders speak in private, but many of them don\u2019t work out and never see the light of day. Having let the cat out of the bag once, Donald Trump probably won\u2019t be getting the same sort of candid exchanges from other world leaders in the future.\n\nAs to the quid pro quo question and the impeachment fantasies of the media, everyone is seeing what they want to see in that call. You can tell it wasn\u2019t as big of a bang as Trump\u2019s detractors had hoped because the media is already scrambling to remind everyone that the President doesn\u2019t need to break the law to be impeached. But unless we suddenly see a \u201cgang\u201d of Republicans in the Senate lining up in agreement to vote to convict the President, I doubt he\u2019s losing much sleep over it. And they\u2019ve got a budget deal to work out in the meantime.", "description": "Behind closed doors", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Zelensky.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
