REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\n(Reuters) - Holiday Inn-owner InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG.L) blamed lower business bookings in China and Hong Kong protests for a 0.8% fall in third-quarter revenue per room on Friday, the latest company to be pinched by weaker global travel.\n\nThe hotel industry in general is feeling the impact of slowing global growth, which is denting business travel. Rival Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT.N) warned that lagging growth in China and the China-U.S. trade war would hurt revenue. Raffles owner AccorHotels (ACCP.PA) narrowed its full-year profit guidance, citing uncertainty on China-related issues.\n\nFour months of protests in Hong Kong have taken a toll on tourism, while weak economic data from China has been discouraging.\n\nIHG reported a 6.1% fall in revenue per available room (RevPAR) in Greater China during the quarter, with a 36% drop in Hong Kong.

Of the 13,000 rooms IHG opened across its brands in the quarter, 4,100 were in China.\n\nBut Chief Financial Officer Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson said the company was seeing more leisure than business travelers, who tend to spend less money on bookings.\n\nEdgecliffe-Johnson said the company had also seen some pressure in the United States as U.S. manufacturing businesses cut spending on conference halls bookings during the third quarter.", "description": "Holiday Inn-owner InterContinental Hotels Group blamed lower business bookings in China and Hong Kong protests for a 0.8% fall in third-quarter revenue per room on Friday, the latest company to be pinched by weaker global travel.", "authors": ["Uday Sampath Kumar", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442224628&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0DT", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
