The United States, European powers and Saudi Arabia have blamed the attacks on Iran, which denies involvement. Instead, Yemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi group claimed responsibility.\n\nThe prince also said President Donald Trump should meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to craft a new deal on Tehran\u2019s nuclear program and regional activities.\n\nEfforts to bring the two together last week at the United Nations failed. Tensions between Washington and Tehran escalated after the U.S. withdrew last year from a 2015 nuclear deal and reinstated sanctions against Tehran.\n\n\u2018ABSOLUTELY NOT\u2019\n\nDays before the anniversary of Khashoggi\u2019s murder, the prince said: \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d when asked if he had ordered it. But he said he took full responsibility \u201csince it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis was a mistake. And I must take all actions to avoid such a thing in the future.\u201d\n\nThe CIA and some Western governments believe MbS ordered the killing, but Saudi officials have repeatedly said he had no role. Asked about the CIA assessment, MbS asked for \u201csuch information\u201d to be revealed.\n\nAfter initial denials, the official Saudi narrative blamed the murder on rogue operatives. The public prosecutor said then-deputy intelligence chief Ahmed al-Asiri ordered the repatriation of Khashoggi, a royal insider who became an outspoken critic, but the lead negotiator ordered him killed after discussions for his return failed.\n\nAsked how the killing could have happened without his knowing about it, MbS said: \u201cSome think that I should know what 3 million people working for the Saudi government do daily? It\u2019s impossible that the 3 million would send their daily reports to the leader or the second highest person in the Saudi government.\u201d\n\nThe crown prince made similar remarks off-camera in a PBS documentary released last week, publicly indicating for the first time personal responsibility for Khashoggi\u2019s death, which sparked Saudi Arabia\u2019s worst political crisis in a generation.\n\nJames Dorsey, a senior fellow at Singapore\u2019s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies and its Middle East Institute, said the comments were \u201csymbolically of value\u201d and might help counter reputational damage including in business circles.\n\n\u201cHowever it makes no contribution to transparency and getting to the bottom of who did what to whom, why and on whose orders,\u201d he said.\n\nEleven Saudi suspects have been put on trial in secretive proceedings. A U.N. report called for MbS and other senior Saudi officials to be investigated. Asiri and Saud al-Qahtani, a senior adviser, were fired over involvement in the operation. Asiri is standing trial, but Qahtani is not.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman attends a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, September 18, 2019.

And once charges are proven against someone, regardless of their rank, it will be taken to court, no exception made.\u201d\n\nKhashoggi, a Washington Post columnist, was last seen at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, where he was to receive papers ahead of his wedding. His body was dismembered and removed from the building. His remains have not been found.\n\nAsked about prominent women activists who have been detained on charges related to human rights work and tarred by local media as traitors, including Loujain al-Hathloul, MbS said: laws \u201cmust be respected, until they are reformed.\u201d", "description": "Saudi Arabia's crown prince warned in an interview broadcast on Sunday that oil prices could spike to \"unimaginably high numbers\" if the world doesn't come together to deter Iran, but said he preferred a political solution to a military one.", "authors": ["Matt Spetalnick", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435333101&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S0WB", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
