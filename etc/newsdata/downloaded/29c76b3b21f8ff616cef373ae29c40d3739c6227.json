(AP Photo/Charles Krupa)\n\nProsecutors recommend Huffman spend a month in prison \u2013 down from the four to 10 months they recommended previous \u2013 and pay up $20,000 in fines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think to send a message this judge will probably give her [Huffman] the 30 days,\u201d Justin Paperny, a California-based federal prison consultant and convicted felon who helps white collar criminals prepare for serving time behind bars, told FOX Business.\n\nPaperny worked as a stockbroker at Bear Stearns and spent 18 months in a federal prison for conspiring to commit fraud. He started White Collar Advice 10 years ago, consulting for rich criminals preparing for a prison sentence charging six figures to do it.\n\nHe features lessons like \u201cWhite Collar 101: Life in Federal Prison\u201d for free on his YouTube channel, and also details lessons he learned firsthand in another video called \u201cThe No. 1 Mistake I made in Federal Prison,\u201d which has 18,000 views.\n\n\u201cWe try to help them understand the nuances of prison \u2013 the dos and don\u2019ts. What to say, what not to say and understand how this will influence the rest of their life,\u201d Paperny, who says he was hired by someone tied to the college admissions scandal, said.\n\nCommon questions he fields particularly from A-list clients include: \u201cWill I be exploited for my celebrity?\u201d \u201cWhat kind of job will I have?\u201d and \u201cAre the showers and bathrooms private?\u201d\n\nThe likes of Bernie Madoff, Martha Stewart and reality stars like Teresa Giudice and Abby Lee Miller have all reportedly enlisted prison consultants to help them navigate the justice system.\n\nMore recently, Loughlin allegedly called Larry Levine, founder of Wall Street Prison Consultants, who served 10 years at nearly a dozen correctional institutions, in July, he told FOX Business. She and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, are accused of paying upwards of $500,000 in bribes to get their daughters into the University of Southern California. Levine says the woman, who sounded like Loughlin, called for advice about the college scandal, and asked about the consequences of not taking a plea deal.\n\nActress Lori Loughlin arrives at federal court in Boston on Wednesday, April 3, 2019, to face charges in a nationwide college admissions bribery scandal. (AP Photo/Steven Senne)\n\n\u201cI explained the judicial process to her; how mail fraud works; how bribery works; why the case was Federal. I said, \u2018Listen up Aunt Becky, you need to pull your head out of your ass. You should have taken that f\u2014king plea agreement, the very first one they offered you because now they\u2019re going to hammer you,\u201d Levine, who charges anywhere between $5,000 and $50,000 said. \u201cI should have sent her [Loughlin] a bill.\u201d\n\nUnlike Huffman, Loughlin and Giannulli pleaded not guilty on April 15 in court. They could face as much as 40 years each in prison if found guilty on charges of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, honest services fraud and money laundering.\n\nHere is the advice prison coaches give white collar criminals like Huffman and Loughlin about navigating life in prison:\n\nShow humility, and don\u2019t accept any special treatment\n\nPaperny says oftentimes when stars go to prison, guards and inmates may fan girl over them, or show sympathy for their case, but the special treatment can make other inmates serving longer sentences become resentful, and this could cause conflict or even a potential fight.\n\n\u201cI let them know in the beginning they\u2019re going to have other inmates and staff cozy up to them and other inmates are going to hate their guts because they\u2019re rich,\u201d said Levine. If someone starts trouble, Paperny says it\u2019s best not to engage.\n\n\u201cIf you are called out in the TV room or someone challenges you, how you respond will really determine the rest of your journey. Some prisoners don\u2019t care if they get into a fight because they\u2019re not looking to improve their reputation. Going to the SHU (Special Housing Unit known as solitary confinement) is nothing to them,\u201d said Paperny.\n\nAvoid drama and show respect\n\nSomething as seemingly little as cutting someone on the lunch line could spark hostility from fellow inmates.\n\n\u201cDo not cut in a food line; do not cut in a telephone line; do not reach across a food tray \u2013 I saw someone get their fingers broken for doing that,\u201d Levine said.\n\nDon\u2019t talk about your case or complain about your sentence\n\nWhen asked about what Huffman should do if she does end up spending a month behind bars, Levine advises her to keep quiet.\n\n\u201cI would advise her to keep her mouth shut. Once she gets inside, do not discuss your case,\u201d said Levine adding: \u201cNobody wants to hear you bitch and moan and wine.\u201d\n\nBe productive and get to work\n\nIf Huffman does get a 30 day prison sentence, Levine recommends she make the most of it.\n\n\u201cI would tell her to break up her time and use her time productively. My best friend was a yellow legal pad and a mechanical pencil. She needs to take the time to prepare for her release,\u201d Levine said.\n\nHe also stressed the importance of getting a job. Whether it\u2019s cleaning the visiting room, waxing floors or scrubbing the showers, working even the most dismal job can give inmates a sense of purpose, make the days go by faster and even lead to good time that could help shave days off their sentence, Levine says.", "description": "Prison coaches get paid upwards of six figures when high profile celebrities are faced with potential jail time.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/04/0/0/AP19098634105550.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
