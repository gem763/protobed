There were concerns about WeWork\u2019s path to profitability and its leader, CEO and cofounder Adam Neumann. As a result, investor interest was weak, and the company considered cutting its valuation by more than 50%. Ultimately, WeWork delayed its IPO on September 17.\n\nAfter the delay, attention shifted to Neumann\u2019s inappropriate antics, like reports of his smoking weed on a private jet, serving employees tequila shots after discussing layoffs, and trademarking the term \u201cWe\u201d and then forcing WeWork to buy it for $5.9 million.
