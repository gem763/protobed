The provision created a tax break for investment in so-called \u201copportunity zones,\u201d which would supposedly help create jobs in low-income areas. In reality the tax break has been used to support high-end hotels and apartment buildings, warehouses that employ hardly any people and so on. And it has made a handful of wealthy, well-connected investors \u2014 including the family of Jared Kushner, Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law \u2014 even wealthier.\n\nIt\u2019s quite a story. But it should be seen in a broader context, as a symptom of the Republican Party\u2019s unwillingness to perform the basic functions of government.\n\nFirst of all, the opportunity-zone debacle isn\u2019t the only example of abuse enabled by the Trump tax cut, which is full of destructive loopholes. That is, after all, what\u2019s bound to happen when you ram a multitrillion-dollar bill through Congress without a single hearing, presumably out of fear that it would have been rejected if anyone had had time to figure out what was in it. The bill\u2019s drafting was so rushed that many provisions were actually written in by hand at the last minute.\n\nAmong other things, the bum\u2019s rush meant that much of the bill was drafted by lobbyists on behalf of their clients. Given that, it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that a provision sold as a policy to help the poor has actually ended up being a giveaway to hedge funds and real estate developers.", "description": "The many, many fiascos of policy by tax cut.", "authors": ["Paul Krugman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/02/opinion/02krugmanWeb/02krugmanWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
