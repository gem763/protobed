Joseph F. Dunford, said that what he characterized as a moderate deployment, numbering in the hundreds, will be in addition to any forces and equipment the United States is asking other allies to contribute.\n\nHe said the military will determine the exact composition of the new forces, the second time in recent months that the United States has boosted troops in the region in response to Iranian actions. The Sept. 14 attack by drones and cruise missiles against two Saudi oil installations appeared to circumvent Saudi defenses, including six battalions of U.S. Patriot missile defense systems.\n\nEsper said that it was clear that the weapons used in the attack \u201cwere Iranian produced and were not launched from Yemen\u201d as Iranian-backed Houthi rebels there initially claimed. \u201cAll indications are that Iran was responsible,\u201d he said.\n\nIran has denied responsibility.\n\nAsked if further, offensive action was contemplated, Esper demurred, saying \u201cthis is the first step we\u2019re taking.\u201d U.S. military officials, concerned that the situation has the potential to escalate, said they were seeking to ensure that the response took a diplomatic path, or at least paired any military actions with diplomacy.\n\nThe announcement came after top Defense and national security officials met with Trump at the White House.\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump announced new sanctions on Iran\u2019s central bank, calling them \u201cthe highest sanctions ever imposed on a country.\u201d\n\nIran, Trump said, \u201cis going to hell\u201d and is \u201cpractically broke.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks to me like they want to keep going at it \u2026 And when they go at it with us, there\u2019s no way they win,\u201d he said, a day after Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said that any military strike against his country would bring \u201call-out war.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, the National Development Fund, was also sanctioned. U.S. officials charge that the multibillion-dollar fund is used to fund military and terrorist operations.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who joined Trump at an Oval Office meeting with the visiting prime minister of Australia, said that \u201cwe\u2019ve now cut off all source of funds to Iran.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury Department charged that the Central Bank of Iran, whose directors were sanctioned last year, provides funding directly to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, itself designated as a terrorist organization for its support of proxy militias in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and elsewhere.\n\nOther governments are now \u201con notice that they are risking the integrity of their financial systems by continuing to work with the Iranian regime\u2019s arm of terror finance, its Central Bank,\u201d Sigal Mandelker, the top Treasury official on terrorism finance, said in a statement.\n\nThe central bank was first sanctioned by Congress in 2011, but those restrictions were lifted by the Obama administration under the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. Trump reimposed them, and the new measures, under executive order, add an additional layer.\n\nSanctions on the National Development Fund, however, are a first.", "description": "Contingent of forces, likely to number in hundreds, to shore up kingdom\u2019s air and missile defenses.", "authors": ["Karen Deyoung", "Associate Editor", "Senior National Security Correspondent", "Paul Sonne", "National Security Reporter Focusing On The U.S. Military"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GT4Z7LW3YYI6TLDDGALHCFKD7Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
