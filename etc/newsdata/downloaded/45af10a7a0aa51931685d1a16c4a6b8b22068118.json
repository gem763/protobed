In his previous role as the president of George Mason University, Cabrera facilitated the hiring of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to a visiting professor position.\n\nNow, a student group that calls themselves \u201cGT for Survivors\u201d is protesting Cabrera\u2019s appointment at Georgia Tech. \u201cStudents at GT and GMU don\u2019t think Kavanaugh\u2019s elevation to SCOTUS means that the allegations made against him should have been overlooked when Angel Cabrera hired him to teach at GMU, either,\u201d the group wrote in a tweet last week.\n\nStudents at GT and GMU don't think Kavanaugh's elevation to SCOTUS means that the allegations made against him should have been overlooked when Angel Cabrera hired him to teach at GMU, either @Mason4Survivors https://t.co/LmHwZmBWqI \u2014 GT4Survivors (@Gt4Survivors) September 26, 2019\n\nThe \u201cGT for Survivors\u201d Facebook page shared a link to a petition entitled \u201cOpen Letter in Opposition to Angel Cabrera.\u201d The petition argues that Cabrera is unfit for his new role due to his professional relationship with Justice Kavanaugh.\n\nThe students of Georgia Tech are dismayed by the selection of Angel Cabrera as our next university president. Dr. Cabrera has demonstrated a lack of empathy and understanding towards gender and sexual minority students and survivors of sexual assault by allowing Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, accused of multiple accounts of sexual misconduct, to be hired as a professor at Cabrera\u2019s current institution, George Mason University.\n\nWe, the undersigned, believe that Angel Cabrera\u2019s hiring of Justice Kavanaugh and subsequent refusal to fire him despite student backlash demonstrates that he is unfit for the role of Georgia Tech president due to his evident lack of compassion, empathy, and understanding for survivors of sexual assault and for gender and sexual minority students and an unwillingness to listen to or cooperate with students.\n\nCabrera encountered similar protests over his decision to hire Kavanaugh during his time at George Mason University. Breitbart News reported in April that student activists at the university were demanding that Kavanaugh be fired from his part-time position at George Mason\u2019s Antonin Scalia Law School.\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.", "description": "A group of students at the Georgia Institute of Technology is protesting the recent appointment of Angel Cabrera as university president over his support for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.", "authors": ["Tom Ciccotta"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/10/supreme-court-kavanaugh-protest-Getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
