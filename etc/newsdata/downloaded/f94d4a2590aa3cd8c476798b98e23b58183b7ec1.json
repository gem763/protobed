Furthermore, these sanctions will ensure that companies or individuals are prohibited from conducting any business in the USA or with any American company worldwide,\" it said.\n\nAnalysts believe the sanctions may have resulted from lobbying by President Cyril Ramaphosa, but they also questioned the timing of the action.\n\nSouth African Ambassador to the US Lana Marks said in a tweet she had met with President Donald Trump on Wednesday to discuss her mission as ambassador.\n\n\"Many things in the works,\" Marks tweeted about the meeting. It was unclear what she was referring to.", "description": "Sergei Magnitsky, a tax accountant in Russia, gave rise to the law under which the US government sanctioned the controversial Gupta family and one of their associates.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4955/4bf9abe12a3744cf9578892ef55e6d9f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
