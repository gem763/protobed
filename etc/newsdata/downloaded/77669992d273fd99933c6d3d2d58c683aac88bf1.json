She told reporters the UK would be the EU's competitor after Brexit\n\nDetails of the compromise plan put forward by Boris Johnson last week are yet to be confirmed but it is thought the proposed way forward is based on a 'customs partnership' between Britain and the EU\n\nThe Commons Leader told the BBC: 'Theresa May got an extension not through UK law but through EU law and, until the 1972 European Communities Act is repealed, EU law is superior law in the UK.\n\n'And the Remainiacs all know that, because they know that it takes two to tango and any extension has to be agreed by the council.'\n\nEU diplomats have been briefing that the 'clock is ticking' - although it is now expected that talks will be allowed to continue up to the eve of the summit, rather than being halted tomorrow as was initially planned.\n\nWhat happens next in the Brexit crisis? Here is how the coming weeks could pan out: Today: Parliament returns for the Queen's Speech. Negotiations continue in Brussels. Wednesday: The final deadline for having an agreement place for sign-off by EU leaders. Thursday-Friday: A crunch EU summit in Brussels. Any deal could be signed off by leaders here. If the talks have broken down, expect Boris Johnson to either boycott the event, or stage a dramatic walkout. Saturday: Parliament will sit on Saturday for the first time since the Falklands War. If there is no Brexit deal by this date Remainer legislation obliges the PM to beg the EU for an extension to avoid No Deal. Mr Johnson is likely to force a vote to make MPs 'own' any delay, having said he would rather 'die in a ditch' than accept one. If there is a deal in place, there will be a make-or-break vote on whether to back it. If passed by the Commons, the government will start rushing legislation through Parliament immediately. Monday: Jeremy Corbyn has said that he will let Mr Johnson trigger an election after an extension has been secured. This would probably be the first day when a motion can be brought to a vote under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, or a confidence vote can be held. October 31: The current deadline for the UK to leave the EU, which Mr Johnson has previously described as 'do or die'.\n\nFormer Cabinet minister Owen Paterson was among those who vented anger at the obstructive attitude from Brussels.\n\n'They keep chiselling for more concessions that dilute what appears to be a very generous offer for RE them. The point comes when you have to say enough is enough,' he told the Daily Telegraph.\n\nA current Cabinet minister warned: 'What the EU needs to understand is all their very clever negotiating tactics don't mean anything if you can't get it through the House of Commons.'\n\nSteve Baker, head of the Tory Eurosceptic ERG group, said Remainer MPs had encouraged EU intransigence by passing legislation demanding a Brexit extension.\n\n'The right way to deal with such hard negotiators is good faith, clarity of purpose, ferocious reasonableness, absolute resolve and indefatigable courage,' he said.\n\n'So it's a pity failing MPs without these characteristics passed the Surrender Act.'\n\nDUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds also voiced doubts over the weekend, suggesting a dual status arrangement would not work and Northern Ireland must stay fully within the UK customs union.\n\nMr Coveney tried to restore some optimism this morning as he said he still believes a deal can be done this week.\n\n'A deal is possible and it's possible this month,' he told reporters as he arrived for talks with EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg this morning.\n\n'It may even be possible this week, but we're not there yet.\n\n'As Michel Barnier said yesterday, there's still a lot of work to be done so I hope that we can make more progress today.'\n\nHe added: 'On Brexit the less we say now the better.'\n\nMeanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that the UK is about to become a 'competitor' after holding talks with Emmanuel Macron over dinner last night.\n\nWhat are the sticking points in Brexit talks? Last week Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar came up with the principles of a new blueprint that brought Brexit talks back from the dead. However, while both sides are now entertaining that a deal could be possible, significant sticking points remain. Customs: Mr Johnson's proposed way forward is thought to involve Northern Ireland leaving the EU's customs union along with the rest of the UK. However, the bloc's tariffs would be collected on goods heading to the province from mainland Britain. If those goods then stayed in Northern Ireland then the business receiving them would be eligible for a rebate on the tariff charged. The EU is concerned about the complexity of the plan, the potential for smuggling, and whether technology exists to implement it. Consent: The two sides are also thought to have come up with a democratic consent mechanism for Northern Ireland to give the assembly a say on what should happen with border arrangements in the future. However, they have hit problems on the technical feasibility of the proposals amid concerns that the offer made by the UK would effectively give the DUP a veto. A compromise is believed to be in the works but it is currently unclear exactly what it is. Commons: There already fears that the DUP and hardline Brexiteers will turn their noses up at any solution agreed by the UK and the EU because it is possible the final deal could end up looking a lot like the plan originally put forward by Theresa May.\n\nHer comments represent a major shift in tone and suggest that European leaders are now beginning to accept that Brexit will usher in a new geo-political dynamic between Britain and the bloc.\n\nMr Barnier stopped short of calling off the talks, which will continue today and tomorrow.\n\nBut his bleak assessment dampened hopes of an imminent breakthrough, which is needed if Britain is to leave the EU on October 31 as Mr Johnson repeatedly promises.\n\nOne senior EU diplomat said: 'It's a kind of Groundhog Day that continues tomorrow on customs.'\n\nAnother added: 'It'll be difficult to have a legal text ready for the summit, but still not impossible if there's some movement.'\n\nA third diplomat said: 'There's momentum but probably not enough time. Negotiations are, as expected, not easy. But they are moving forward.'\n\nEU officials had already privately said there was little chance of reaching a deal in time.\n\nMr Johnson's plan involves creating two customs areas on the island of Ireland, which one senior EU source close to the negotiations described as 'mind-bogglingly' complex.\n\nThey added: 'This requires careful legal work you can't do hastily. That makes it all very tricky.'\n\nThe plan would see Northern Ireland being subject to EU customs tariffs as goods cross the Irish Sea from mainland Britain. But Northern Irish businesses would claim back rebates, meaning it would de facto remain within UK customs jurisdiction.\n\nA meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg today had been targeted as the moment at which details of a final divorce deal could be made public.\n\nMr Johnson's plan involves creating two customs areas on the island of Ireland, which one senior EU source close to the negotiations described as 'mind-bogglingly' complex\n\nA meeting of EU foreign ministers will take place tomorrow in Luxembourg, where they ideally want sight of final proposals\n\nUnder the terms of the so-called Benn Act, Mr Johnson must accept whatever extension is offered by the EU if there is no agreement before October 31.\n\nAny new legal text will have to be translated into all of the bloc's languages and subjected to scrutiny by its legal services.\n\nThe EU parliament must then pass it, where it would have to go through committee hearings before facing a full vote. One EU source said it was 'really unlikely' all these processes could take place by the end of the month.\n\nUK Government spokesman said there had been 'constructive discussions' but that there is still 'a significant amount of work to be done'.", "description": "Dublin today injected fresh optimism into ongoing Brexit talks as Simon Coveney said a divorce deal could still be agreed before a crunch EU summit on Thursday.", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline", "Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/10/19685520-0-image-a-16_1571047024650.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
