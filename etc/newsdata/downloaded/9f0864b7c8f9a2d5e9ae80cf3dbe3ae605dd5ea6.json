[I'll] dump my husband and then go on a dating app!' she joked.\n\nScroll down for audio\n\n'I just want to see who's on there!' Rebecca Judd (right) joked on Monday that she is tempted to leave her husband Chris (left) so she can sign up for celebrity dating app Raya\n\nBut Monty thought she may have been taking things too far, saying a divorce wasn't necessary if Rebecca simply wanted to have a casual swipe through.\n\n'We can tell him. You don't have to dump him yet,' she said, before adding, 'Unless you find someone better on the app!'\n\nThe discussion started after Olympia, 26, revealed last week she had met her AFL star boyfriend Thomas Bellchambers, 30, on Raya.\n\nTaking it offline: The discussion was inspired by Olympia Valance (left) revealing last week that she had met her boyfriend Thomas Bellchambers (right) on Raya\n\n'We met on a dating app! It's this app for people that are in the public eye,' she explained during an interview with Nova 96.9's Fitzy & Wippa.\n\nOlympia said they started chatting on Raya and soon realised they lived close to one another in Melbourne.\n\nAnd according to the former Neighbours star, the invite-only dating app is teeming with famous faces.\n\nHaving a laugh: 'I just want to get on it to see who's on there... [I'll] dump my husband and then go on a dating app!' Rebecca said jokingly. Pictured with Chris\n\n'So many people... There were some really big stars!' she told the radio program.\n\nWhile Olympia refused to name anyone, she strongly hinted that Formula One star Lewis Hamilton was one of the stars she encountered on the app.\n\nCuriosity aside, it's unlikely Rebecca will be signing up for Raya anytime soon.\n\nSolid: Curiosity aside, it's unlikely Rebecca will be signing up for Raya anytime soon as she is happily married to Chris, with whom she shares four children: Oscar, Billy, Tom and Darcy\n\nIn an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald in May, the radio presenter said that seeing her parents get divorced when she was a child made her 'absolutely determined to keep things together' with Chris.\n\n'Growing up, I hated that I didn't have my mum and dad together,' she said. 'Everyone else seemed to have mum and dad living together, and I'd see dad at weekends.'\n\nRebecca married AFL player Chris Judd in 2010. The couple share four children: son Oscar, eight, daughter Billie, five, and three-year-old twins Tom and Darcy.", "description": "Rebecca Judd's curiosity got the better of her during a discussion about dating apps on her KIIS FM radio show, The 3pm Pick-Up, on Monday.", "authors": ["Demeter Stamell For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/02/20015364-0-image-a-9_1571706817515.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
