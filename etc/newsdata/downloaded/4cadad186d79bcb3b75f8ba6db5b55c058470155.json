She is serving a 15-month sentence, but will be released nearly two months early despite being denied parole. More from CNN:\n\nMichelle Carter has earned \u201cgood time\u201d that will move up her release to March 13 from May 5, Bristol County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokesman Jonathan Darling told CNN Friday in a statement. Inmates can earn as many as 10 days monthly for working at the jail and attending educational and other programs, he said. Meantime, Carter\u2019s appeal Thursday to be released after serving about half her sentence was denied by a two-member state parole board, according to a record of the decision provided by the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security in Massachusetts.\n\nCarter was 17 when she convinced Roy to kill himself. Roy was found dead in his car from self-inflicted carbon monoxide poisoning, and investigators found texts between the two that showed Carter had pushed her boyfriend to go through with the suicide.\n\n\u201cYou have to just do it,\u201d she texted him as Roy contemplated suicide, according to her arrest documents. \u201cYou have everything you need. There is no way you can fail. Tonight is the night. It\u2019s now or never.\u201d\n\nFollowing Roy\u2019s death, Carter texted a friend saying she was worried authorities would discover the texts and expressed concern she could face jail time.\n\nIn July, her attorneys filed a petition to the Supreme Court asking for her conviction to be overturned, The Washington Post reported. Her lawyer argues that Carter\u2019s right to free speech shields her from criminal responsibility.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never in society\u2019s best interest to incarcerate for the content of their speech where there was not a specific statute that criminalizes such speech at the time it was made,\u201d Carter\u2019s lawyer, Joseph Cataldo, told CNN Friday.\n\nRelated coverage\n\nMichelle Carter, Woman Who Told Boyfriend To Kill Himself, Files Supreme Court Appeal\n\nLove HuffPost?
