At various points, he stood accused of illegal enrichment, benefitting from the illegal distribution of drilling permits, false accounting and not paying taxes.\n\nIn the months after the EuroMaidan revolution disposed of the Yanukovych regime, Zlochevsky found himself a wanted man. He feared for his business. He feared for his life. Pushed out of Ukraine, Zlochevsky also seemed out of step with the times.\n\nBut somehow, over the next two years, with the help of his international board, and Bell Pottinger, the infamous and now-defunct British PR firm, Zlochevsky recovered his standing.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Outwardly respectable organisations such as the Adam Smith Institute became partners. There was talk of a listing on the London Stock Exchange; a place at the top table of Europe. There were charity events and glitzy functions, not least the massive energy forum that Burisma hosted in Monte Carlo in 2016.\n\nHunter Biden was one of the many guests at that event, seen schmoozing alongside Zlochevsky and the likes of Prince Albert II of Monaco.\n\nBy 2018, industry insiders say Burisma had begun to be recognised for good management practices and clever procurement.\n\nBut all that, and Hunter Biden\u2019s huge gamble, came falling down this summer in the wake of scandal and an impeachment inquiry in the United States.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It is also clear that Trump has only incoherent conspiracy theories to call on in his demand for a probe.\n\nBut in dissecting that fantasy, no one emerges with great honour.\n\nTo recap, the Trumpian narrative alleges that Joe Biden used the threat of blocking a billion-dollar IMF loan to remove Viktor Shokin, Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor. He did so, the allegation goes, to prevent Shokin from investigating wrongdoing by his son\u2019s firm.\n\nWhile the first part of the claim is true \u2013 Biden himself boasted of the fact, perhaps unwisely \u2013 the second part is incomprehensible.\n\nSimply put, there were no active investigations into Burisma at the time of Shokin\u2019s removal in 2016. If anything, Shokin served as a barrier to a real investigation into the company. When, for example, Britain\u2019s Serious Fraud Office froze $23m (\u00a319m) of Zlochevsky\u2019s assets after a money laundering investigation, it was Shokin\u2019s office that produced an exonerating letter that Zlochevsky then used to unfreeze the cash. Internal prosecutor reports seen by Bloomberg confirmed that Shokin declined to pursue an investigation at all stages.\n\nNeither does the narrative fit with the logic of the time. It is hard to describe this as a personal vendetta pushed by vice-president Biden. A much wider community \u2013 the European Union, the International Monetary Fund, and a wide range of anti-corruption actors \u2013 were pushing for Shokin\u2019s removal. President Petro Poroshenko, a patron and long-time associate, was one of very few resisting it.\n\nThis is not a scandal of Kiev\u2019s making \u2013 or asking. Many Ukrainians are surprised to see the name of Burisma pushed to international front pages. They are even more astonished at seeing their former chief prosecutor portrayed as an anti-corruption warrior.\n\n\u201cWe were very angry that three separate general prosecutors failed to investigate Burisma properly,\u201d says Daria Kaleniuk, the founder of Ukraine\u2019s Anti-Corruption Action Centre, an organisation that has examined Burisma\u2019s dealings in forensic detail. \u201cBut we are frankly amazed that a corrupt prosecutor is now being described [by Donald Trump] as a good prosecutor.\u201d\n\nAnother prominent anti-corruption expert suggested that the prosecutor office\u2019s limited focus on Burisma was likely never wholesome in the first place.\n\n\u201cThe fact that some investigations were opened did not mean the prosecutor had any intentions of pursuing them,\u201d says Oleksa Shalaisky, founder of the Nashi Hroshi anti-corruption watchdog.\n\n\u201cIt was the modus operandi of the time. They would open a mass of investigations into Yanukovych-linked companies, but none of them were actually real, just invitations to talk, to settle. And most people did exactly that.\u201d\n\nBurisma\u2019s success in seeing criminal investigations against it closed over 2014-16 could fall into such a pattern. But Zlochevsky also had a clear advantage over his competitors: an all-star international board, with the son of America\u2019s Ukraine enforcer at its centre.\n\nZlochevsky was not the first Ukrainian oligarch to look to protect his assets with prominent western backers. But looking back, his 2013-14 management shakeup, timed before the violent end of Maidan, looks extraordinarily prescient. The first political heavyweight he recruited was former Polish president Alexander Kwasniewski, who joined in January. Biden came on board three months later, after the end of Maidan.\n\nThe transformation of Burisma\u2019s management structure is reflected in its Cyprus accounts, seen by The Independent. These show that expenditure on directors rocketed from $40,000 in 2013 to $2.5m in 2014.\n\nFor anti-corruption expert Shalaisky, the presence of men like Biden and Kwasniewski on the Burisma board amounted to owning a \u201cdiscount card\u201d against any future extortion attempts.\n\nThere was one other troubling possibility, Shalaisky adds: that the Bidens were aware of attempts by the prosecutors\u2019 office to extract bribes. In other words, if any significant conflict of interest existed, it was that Joe Biden removed Shokin with personal knowledge of the prosecutor office\u2019s attempts to extract rent.\n\n\u201cIf that is the case, it may have been an anti-corruption move, but the Biden family could not be described as neutral bystanders,\u201d Shalaisky says.\n\nI\u2019m not sure Hunter had any real responsibility. He was interested in the company\u2019s business in European markets and Saudi investment Former advisor to Burisma\n\nOther sources suggest it was highly unlikely that Zlochevsky would have made Hunter Biden aware of any improper approaches. One source, who acted as an advisor to Burisma, and who met Biden Jnr on two of his Kiev visits \u2013 The Independent understands these numbered up to five \u2013 said the American appeared to have a very limited role in the organisation.\n\n\u201cHunter probably knew who Shokin was, but Burisma was not a 24/7 job to put it mildly,\u201d the source tells The Independent. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Hunter had any real responsibility. He was interested in the company\u2019s business in European markets and Saudi investment. That\u2019s all we talked about and it seemed to be his only area of influence.\u201d\n\nAnti-corruption expert Kaleniuk, while agreeing that extortion was the general \u201cbusiness model\u201d of Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor office, cautions against fuelling \u201cperceptions\u201d and \u201cfurther conspiracies.\u201d\n\n\u201cHunter Biden did a very bad thing in taking the job, and perhaps US institutions need to look into what he knew or didn\u2019t know,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we also need to keep to the facts. The main fact is that Joe Biden was firing a prosecutor who was dumping \u2013 not progressing \u2013 investigations.\u201d\n\nIt is not yet clear quite how the Shokin conspiracy theory first came to Trump, ready to be wheeled out in the now infamous telephone exchange with Zelensky on 25 July.\n\nBy the time of the call, the narrative was at least eight months old. It dates to at least October 2018, says Kaleniuk: this was the moment she first received \u201ctendentious\u201d questions from the controversial right-wing commentator John Solomon. Solomon has fuelled the conspiracy theory with early, excited, and generally inaccurate columns in the Washington publication The Hill.\n\nAt some point, perhaps also in 2018, the story was picked up by Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudi Giuliani. It was then amplified by several uncritical articles in the New York Times, and, perhaps most astonishingly, by Yuriy Lutsenko, Shokin\u2019s replacement as prosecutor general.\n\nWe know that Guiliani was in contact with Lutsenko on the subject of the Bidens from at least January 2019, meeting at least twice, calling many times besides. According to Sergii Leschenko, a journalist and former Zelensky advisor, Lutsenko also furnished Guiliani with a document detailing dubious allegations against the Bidens.\n\nLutsenko has not commented on the document, but on a trip to the United States in January, he hinted that the Bidens had a case to answer.\n\nThe only reason we are reading this story is because previously corrupt untouchables are now feeling the heat and looking for ways to save themselves Daria Kaleniuk, anti-corruption campaigner\n\nAt the time, the under-fire prosecutor was almost certainly trying to use the Trump administration to secure his own position. It was already clear Lutsenko was about to lose the protection of his patron Petro Poroshenko \u2013 he would fall to a landslide in April. Lutsenko, with many enemies and few allies, understood he had very little other support to fall back on.\n\nIn May, Guiliani announced he would be flying to Kiev to meet Lutsenko and president-elect Zelensky. But that meeting was abruptly cancelled \u2013 an apparent response to a snub first reported by The Independent. Soon after the aborted visit, prosecutor Lutsenko switched positions.\n\nSpeaking with Bloomberg in May, he declared that he saw no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens. In several interviews this week, he repeated that position \u2013 much to the consternation of his one-time ally Giuliani.\n\nLutsenko, who has temporarily left Kiev for London, declined to talk to The Independent, citing previous interviews to other outlets that had \u201cfailed to put across his position\u201d.\n\nA source in the former Ukrainian government suggested to The Independent that it was unlikely Guiliani or Lutsenko were involved in the earliest stages of the theory. That source instead pointed to grand designs of an oft-cited bogeyman, Russia, but failed to offer clear evidence in support of that theory.\n\nThe investigative outlet OCCRP has meanwhile suggested that two Soviet-born US businessmen Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were key actors in channelling the Biden narrative to Guiliani.\n\nWhatever the truth of the source\u2019s assertions, the scandal has clearly not played out to Ukraine\u2019s advantage. Many in Kiev now worry about the prospect of losing bipartisan support in the conflict with Russia.\n\nFor Ukraine\u2019s rookie president Volodymyr Zelensky, there are no easy choices, says the independent political analyst Vladimir Fesenko.\n\nEither Zelensky can deny Trump his investigation, and risk losing the support of a president who was never really keen on Ukraine in the first place. Or he can open the investigation, give Trump what he wants, and risk losing the support of the Democrats for a generation.\n\n\u201cSo far the position seems to be to stay as close to neutral as possible,\u201d Fesenko tells The Independent. \u201cThey will start an investigation if there is an official request from Washington, but not otherwise.\u201d\n\nKaleniuk says it is a \u201ctragedy\u201d that Ukraine had been dragged into American politics.\n\n\u201cEveryone now believes Ukraine is some kind of corrupt swamp,\u201d she says. \u201cIn fact, the only reason we are reading this story is because previously corrupt untouchables are now feeling the heat and looking for ways to save themselves.\n\n\u201cThe stakes for them are huge, and unfortunately they\u2019ve found no shortage of corrupt cliques across the ocean who are ready to help.\u201d", "description": "Even at the time, Hunter Biden\u2019s decision to accept a $50,000\u00a0per month directorship at a little known Ukrainian gas company felt like an unwise gamble.", "authors": ["Oliver Carroll"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/02/18/ukraine-impeachment.jpg"}
