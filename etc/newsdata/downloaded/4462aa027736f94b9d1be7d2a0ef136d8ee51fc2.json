Pedro Xim\u00e9nez, as well as being wickedly black and sweet, has its own anise qualities, making it an ideal flavouring for the accompanying chilled cream. We favour blood plums here, for their gorgeous moody colour, but use whatever variety suits you best.\n\nYou will need a 25cm ovenproof non-stick frying pan.\n\nServes 6-8\n\nunsalted butter 50g\n\ncaster sugar 50g\n\nbay leaves 2\n\nstar anise 2\n\nvanilla bean \u00bd, split lengthways and seeds scraped\n\npink peppercorns 1 tsp, lightly crushed\n\norange juice of \u00bd\n\nblood plums 12, halved and pitted\n\ngood-quality butter puff pastry 225g\n\nFor the sherry cream\n\norange finely grated zest of 1 and juice of \u00bd\n\ncreme fraiche 125g\n\nGreek-style yogurt 80g\n\nPedro Xim\u00e9nez sherry 30ml\n\nicing sugar to taste\n\nStart by making the sherry cream. Combine all the ingredients except the sugar together in a mixing bowl. Whisk together well, then taste and add sufficient sugar to please your own palate. Chill until required.\n\nPreheat the oven to 210C/gas mark 7.\n\nCombine the butter and sugar in the non-stick frying pan and cook over a low heat until the sugar dissolves. Add the bay leaves, star anise, vanilla bean and seeds, peppercorns and orange juice and cook over a high heat for 8-10 minutes until it forms a dark caramel. Once the caramel is dark and you can smell the spices, remove the pan from the heat. Add the plums to the pan and turn them around in the caramel to coat, then arrange them neatly in concentric circles, skin side down.\n\nRoll out the pastry to a circle roughly 26cm in diameter.\n\nCarefully lift it onto the pan and tuck it in around the edges so that it envelops and contains the fruit.\n\nBake for 20-25 minutes, or until the pastry is puffed and golden. Remove the pan from the oven and leave the tart to sit and settle for 15 minutes before inverting it carefully onto a serving plate. Serve with the chilled sherry cream.\n\nFrom Suqar by Greg and Lucy Malouf (Hardie Grant, \u00a330)\n\nTomos Parry\u2019s dover sole with grapes\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tomos Parry\u2019s dover sole with grapes. Photograph: Romas Foord/The Observer\n\nThis is inspired by the classic French dish sole V\u00e9ronique. I like to cook this dish in late September and October as the grapes are fully ripe and ready to pick for harvest. When I have served this dish in the past, I make the sauce separately, then serve with a char-grilled whole dover sole and garnish with wood roasted sweet and caramelised grapes.\n\nServes 2\n\nolive oil 2 tbsp\n\nDover sole fillets 4\n\nplain flour\n\nsalt\n\nunsalted butter 50g\n\nseedless red grapes 150g, half cut in half\n\nwhite grape juice 25ml\n\ndry white wine 25 ml\n\nvermouth 25ml\n\nfish stock 25ml\n\ndrained capers 1 tbsp\n\nfresh parsley 1 tbsp chopped\n\nlemon juice\n\nblack pepper\n\nHeat the oil in a nonstick pan over a medium heat. Season the sole fillets with a light coating of flour and salt, and fry over a medium heat (around 2 minutes on each side), until the fish is almost cooked and has developed a slight golden colour.\n\nRemove the fish from the pan and rest. Add the butter and whole grapes and begin to cook them gently, then add the grape juice, white wine and vermouth, and bring to the boil, then add the fish stock. Reduce this sauce to thicken (around 5 minutes).\n\nTurn the heat off and return the sole to the sauce, with the halved grapes, capers, parsley and a squeeze of lemon juice and some black pepper and extra salt to taste.\n\nServe with wilted greens.\n\nTomos Parry is chef-owner of Brat, London E1\n\nTim Siadatan\u2019s braised hispi cabbage, clams, chilli and oregano\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tim Siadatan\u2019s braised hispi cabbage, clams, chilli and oregano. Photograph: Elena Heatherwick\n\nI love hispi cabbage in all its forms, but especially slow-cooked and smothered in buttery, spicy clams.\n\nServes 4\n\nhispi cabbage 2 small\n\nolive oil\n\nchilli 1 tsp, deseeded and finely chopped\n\ngarlic \u00bd clove, finely chopped\n\ndried oregano 1 tsp\n\nwhite wine \u00bd glass\n\nclams 200g (or mussels), cleaned, any open ones discarded\n\nunsalted butter 20g\n\npepper\n\nPreheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6.\n\nRemove the outer leaves from the cabbage and cut the cabbage in half lengthways. On a medium heat, heat some olive oil in a pan big enough to fit the length of cabbage. Working in batches, colour the cabbage on its cut side until golden. Put into a roasting tray.\n\nWipe away any cabbage debris from the pan and discard, then add a glug of olive oil and add the chilli, garlic and oregano. Fry for 2-3 minutes, until starting to colour, then add the white wine and reduce for 3 minutes.\n\nTransfer into the roasting tray with the cabbage and add the uncooked clams. Mix together, add a couple of centimetres of water, the butter and some pepper, then cover tightly with foil and put in the oven. Roast for 20 minutes until the cabbage is soft at the root and the clams are open (discard any closed ones). Taste to see if it needs salt (the clams might have done the job for you).\n\nFrom Trullo by Tim Siadatan (Square Peg, \u00a325)\n\nTrine Hahnemann\u2019s duck legs with potatoes, apples and brown cabbage\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Trine Hahnemann\u2019s duck legs with potatoes, apples and brown cabbage. Photograph: Columbus Leth\n\nThis recipe feels a bit like going to some of the small museums you\u2019ll find around Scandinavia, housing paintings by the old masters. When I eat this I can see the landscape in those paintings, the potatoes from the soil, the apples that grow on the trees, the ducks walking around in the villages, and the dark kitchens that smell of cabbage. It is a little bit like time travel.\n\nServes 4; cabbage serves 4-6\n\ncardamom pods 5\n\nwhole allspice berries 1 tbsp\n\ncloves 4\n\nfreshly ground black pepper 2 tsp\n\ncoarse sea salt 1 tbsp\n\nduck legs 4\n\npotatoes 700g, unpeeled\n\napples 4\n\n\n\nFor the brown cabbage (brunk\u00e5l)\n\nwhite cabbage 1.5kg\n\nbutter 75g\n\ncaster sugar 50g\n\nblack peppercorns 1 tsp\n\nallspice 2 tsp\n\ncaraway seeds 2 tsp\n\nbay leaves 2\n\nthyme sprigs 10\n\nsea salt and freshly ground black pepper\n\nlemon juice to taste\n\n\n\nGrind the spices to a coarse mixture using a pestle and mortar. Mix in the salt, rub the mixture into the duck legs and refrigerate for 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Place the duck legs in a roasting tin and roast for 1 hour, now and then basting the duck legs with the fat rendering into the tin as they cook.\n\nFor the brown cabbage, cut the cabbage into medium-thin slices. Melt the butter and cook until light brown, then add the sugar and let it melt into a light brown caramel. Stir well, then add the cabbage, spices and herbs and stir well. Reduce the heat to low, cover and let it simmer for about 2 hours. Take off the heat; season to taste with salt, pepper and lemon juice.\n\nMeanwhile, cut the potatoes and apples into wedges. When the duck legs have roasted for an hour, add the potatoes to the tin and roast for another 45 minutes, then add the apples, mix well with the juices in the roasting tin and roast for another 15 minutes. Check that the duck meat is tender and, if not, continue to cook a little longer. Serve with the brown cabbage.\n\nFrom Scandinavian Comfort Food: Embracing the Art of Hygge by Trine Hahnemann (Quadrille, \u00a326)\n\nNigel Slater\u2019s baked sausages with harissa and tomatoes\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nigel Slater\u2019s baked sausages with harissa and tomatoes. Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The Observer\n\nI like a coarse-cut, spicy sausage to cook with haricot beans. The pork, fennel seeds and black-pepper-seasoned sausages that hang in Italian grocers, displayed in plump clusters tied together with string, to be exact. Of course, any good sausages will fit the bill, as long as they are so generously filled they look like their skins are about to burst.\n\nThe recipe can be upscaled easily to cater for large numbers, but add the harissa paste to taste rather than simply multiplying the amount.\n\nServes 2-3\n\nolive oil 2 tbsp\n\nsausages 6 large\n\nonion 1\n\nrosemary 5 sprigs\n\nharissa paste 2 tsp\n\ntomatoes 4 medium\n\nharicot or cannellini beans 2 x 400g cans\n\nchicken stock 200ml\n\nUsing a little of the olive oil, brown the sausages in a shallow, ovenproof pan over a low to moderate heat, turning them regularly so they brown as evenly as possible. Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6.\n\nPeel the onion and roughly chop it. Remove the sausages and set them aside, then add the remaining olive oil to the pan and then the chopped onion, letting it soften and colour lightly. It should be the palest gold. Remove the leaves from 2 of the sprigs of rosemary, finely chop them, then add them to the softened onion with a pinch of salt.\n\nStir the harissa paste into the onion. Roughly chop the tomatoes. Add the chopped tomatoes to the onion and rosemary and cook for a few minutes until the tomatoes have started to soften. Drain the beans, rinse them under running water, stir them into the onion, then pour in the stock and bring to the boil. Lower the heat, then return the sausages to the pan. Check the seasoning then bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes.\n\nNigel Slater is the Observer\u2019s cookery writer", "description": "Dover sole with grapes, roasted duck legs, baked sausages with harissa \u2013 part 2 of our favourite simple autumn recipes", "authors": ["Tim Siadatan", "Nigel Slater", "Simon Hopkinson", "Greg", "Lucy Malouf", "Tomos Parry"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a256bbbfbbbaab509573e23f9b922c52cb1c205/0_2270_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ab0f64c8dd85794d4d4f0e1f43aae8d4", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
