They\u2019re always on vacation somewhere, or pushing some new line of alcohol, or lip gloss, or the thing Tom Schwartz is peddling now which seems to be a line of clothing that says \u201cChilling\u201d on it. And when they\u2019re not doing that, they\u2019re riding around on little motorized coolers without their wedding rings, sparking divorce rumors. Ugh. You can be forgiven, then, for not being adequately up-to-date on the Instagram-based drama currently surrounding Jax Taylor and, well, a bunch of the cast, but, mainly \u2014 and of course \u2014 Kristen Doute.\n\nLet\u2019s get right into it.\n\nWhen did the drama begin?\n\nE! News reported on August 20 that, following the wrap of Vanderpump Rules\u2019 eighth season, Jax unfollowed several of his co-stars on Instagram \u2014 Tom Sandoval, Ariana Madix, Kristen Doute, and Scheana Shay. (He did not unfollow his wife Brittany Cartwright, Stassi Schroeder, her fianc\u00e9 Beau Clark, Lala Kent, Lala Kent\u2019s man, Katie Maloney, or Tom Schwartz.) Quelle horreur! The reason behind the unfollowing was unknown, but E! noted at the time that Stassi had spoken about the eighth season\u2019s tenseness on her podcast, Straight Up With Stassi.\n\n\u201cThe drama is killing me,\u201d Stassi reportedly said. \u201cI can\u2019t anymore. I can\u2019t talk about this shit anymore \u2026 I\u2019m literally dead inside.\u201d Beau Clark was a guest on the episode, and he agreed, saying, \u201cMy emotions are shot.\u201d He noted that season seven was much more fun to film than season eight, which \u2014 just saying \u2014 some predicted would be the case.\n\nSomething else to note is that Kristen did not make an appearance at Stassi and Beau\u2019s engagement party in July, or Katie and Schwartz\u2019s July sort-of do-over wedding in Vegas (they never signed a marriage license), and she was absent when Stassi went wedding-dress shopping at the end of August. When asked about Kristen\u2019s absence \u2014 again, on Instagram \u2014 Stassi\u2019s mom Dayna confirmed the feud, saying, \u201cYes, quite sad. But I didn\u2019t really know all the particulars. So I was out of the loop for awhile. Don\u2019t you worry, it\u2019s like Lion King and the circle of life \u2026 each one of these girls will grow, change and come back to their original strong friendship bond that they\u2019ve always had. Some things just take time.\u201d Hm!\n\nHas Kristen responded to the drama?\n\nShe has responded to the Jax-related drama, yes. In response to the reporting about Jax\u2019s mass unfollowing, she tweeted, \u201cI know @enews has been saying that Jax unfollowed some of us because of something regarding his wedding. Let me clear the air: Jax did not unfollow me, Jax blocked me. Why? NO CLUE. But I promise you it has nothing to do with beautiful Britt or their wedding.\u201d\n\nI know @enews has been saying that Jax unfollowed some of us because of something regarding his wedding.

From Us:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve changed,\u201d a caterpillar tells a butterfly in Kristen\u2019s post.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to,\u201d the butterfly answers.\n\nHeh.\n\nBut wait \u2014 why is Jax mad at Sandoval and Arianna? Oh, and Scheana?\n\nIt is unclear. According to an E! News source, \u201c[Jax] had a huge blowout fight with Tom and Ariana in June.\u201d The source claims the drama is about the decision to have Lance Bass officiate their wedding, after the pastor they initially hired turned out to be wildly homophobic. Allegedly, Sandoval and Ariana were upset that Lance Bass was the replacement, because they \u2014 allegedly \u2014 believe this choice was only made because he is a celebrity. This explanation is odd to me, however, because I\u2019m not sure why anyone would care about who officiated another person\u2019s wedding, particularly if they were brought in to replace a homophobe. Though I suppose it could be that Sandoval wanted Jax to have him officiate. That sounds like Sandoval.\n\n(It is perhaps worth noting that, again on Instagram, Ariana was spotted at Jax and Brittany\u2019s Labor Day pool party. Sandoval was not.)\n\nI do not know why he unfollowed Scheana. Maybe he just didn\u2019t like her posts?\n\nWhat\u2019s happening now?\n\nIt\u2019s seems like at least Jax and Kristen have made up. On Monday, September 2, Kristen posted a photo of herself and Jax on Instagram, captioning it: \u201cHe loves me, he loves me not\u2026 HE LOVES ME \ud83c\udf3c @mrjaxtaylor.\u201d\n\nAriana commented, \u201cwhat is even happening lol \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude02.\u201d Kristen responded, \u201c@ariana252525 our shit is so intense to me and somehow people need to make it more & fake in order to make it their level of intense.\u201d Then Kristen said, \u201c@ariana252525 I\u2019m on my period #feelings.\u201d And Ariana said, \u201c@kristendoute lol i love your mess.\u201d\n\nNotably, Ariana also stood up for Jax\u2019s marriage in the comments, responding to a commenter: \u201che\u2019s not having marriage trouble, just gonna go ahead and nip that one lol.\u201d Hm. What does it mean?\n\nKristen also tweeted about their resolution:\n\ni\u2019m still blocked on Twitter but we made up pic.twitter.com/cpt1Xf0nTq \u2014 kristen doute \ud83e\udd92\ud83e\udd1f\ud83c\udffd (@kristendoute) September 3, 2019\n\nOkay great. When does the show come back?\n\nThey haven\u2019t announced a premiere date for season eight yet, but probably toward the end of 2019.", "description": "A look into the current, somewhat mystifying Vanderpump Rules Instagram drama involving, mainly, Jax Taylor and Kristen Doute.", "authors": ["Kelly Conaboy"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/04/4-jax-taylor-kristen-doute.w1200.h630.jpg"}
