Mother Cabrini is right at the top of the list for consideration.\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cI will make a strong case for Mother Cabrini.\u201d\n\nThe conversation between the two Italian-Americans became heated over Palminteri\u2019s comments last week on his perceived racism on the part of city First Lady Chirlane McCray, who launched the initiative in June 2018 with Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen and the Department of Cultural Affairs.\n\nPalminteri apologized to de Blasio and asked for the mayor to relay the apology to his wife, which the mayor agreed to do thanking the actor for his apology.\n\nSt. Cabrini garnered a total 219 nominations, while urban activist Jane Jacobs, who was also not selected, received the second-highest number of nominations with 93. America\u2019s first black Congresswoman Shirley Anita Chisholm, who represented Brooklyn, was selected after receiving the third-most nominations with 91.\n\nA City Hall spokeswoman pointed out earlier this week that the call for public nominations was not a voting process, and that many other factors were considered as part of the initiative.\n\nAlong with Chisholm, jazz singer Billie Holiday, early civil rights figure Elizabeth Jennings Graham, Dr. Helen Rodriguez Tr\u00edas, lighthouse keeper Katherine Walker, and early LGBTQ activists Marsha Johnson and Sylvia Rivera were selected in the first round of honorees.\n\nMAYOR INFORMS MALLIOTAKIS\n\nAssemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis (R-East Shore/South Brooklyn) also announced Friday that she had been contacted by the mayor\u2019s office, which informed her that there will be another round of statues, and that Mother Cabrini is still being considered.\n\n\u201cI am glad that they are reconsidering their decision and listening to the countless Catholics and Italian-Americans, as well as elected officials, who are pushing to get Mother Cabrini her rightfully-deserved statue in city public space,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAs both a woman and daughter of immigrants, I believe it is fitting that our city recognize the many contributions Mother Cabrini made for new immigrants, children and those suffering with illness.\u201d\n\nMother Cabrini is the patron saint of immigrants, and founded an upstate orphanage, a school for girls in Washington Heights and dozens of organizations for the needy.\n\nIn a letter to the Advance published Thursday, Malliotakis asked why Cabrini wasn\u2019t being honored despite receiving the most public nominations.\n\nRep. Max Rose (D-Staten Island/South Brooklyn), whose seat Malliotakis is running for in the 2020 election, has voiced similar frustrations with the city over the perceived snub of Mother Cabrini.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absurd for the Mayor\u2019s office to solicit public input and then completely ignore the community,\u201d he said Tuesday.", "description": "", "authors": ["Paul Liotta", "Pliotta Siadvance.Com"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HMNE6QSGEBHJJOZKORQ7HKFDIM.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
