They cleared out the entrance hall, pictured, painted the walls white and added paintings, a modern desk, and a pot-plant to turn it into a mini-study\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a The pair stripped out the old interior, re-did plaster, electrics, pipework in the flat, including in the sitting room where they re-painted the whole room, replaced the windows, and put in a modern sofa\n\nThe happy couple, pictured together at the European Premiere of 'Knives Out' in London this month, lived at Tony's mother's house while doing the work\n\nThe first time Shanie entered the property, which had no electricity or running water and a serious damp problem, she said she came out 'smelling of mould'.\n\n'It was in such bad condition that the council said it wasn't even wind or watertight', she told MailOnline.\n\n'It had nothing done to it for 25 years as the gentleman that lived there before was a hoarder, had a bit of an alcohol problem, and didn't like to have people round.\n\n'The flat was literally frozen in time - he had died in the bath unexpectedly and his cup of coffee was still there - it was pretty eerie and creepy.\n\n'Roots were also growing under the floors and interrupting the pipes.'\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a The bathroom was also converted (pictured). Everything was torn out so that a new bath and toilet could be added, and the walls could be tiled a chic grey. A new shower and heated drying rack were also installed\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a The flat had been left 'frozen in time' because its previous occupant, who was a hoarder, died unexpectedly. In the bedroom the walls were painted a deep shade of blue and a large bed was added alongside a shelf for many pairs of shoes\n\nTony's favourite part of the renovation process was taking a sledgehammer to the old furniture and fittings, while Shanie enjoyed deciding colour schemes and adding the finishing touches\n\nNot to be put off by a challenge, however, the pair, who have been together for ten years, decided to buy the flat for its 'flexible space'.\n\n'We viewed 60 to 70 properties and this was the first one that we saw with real space wise potential', said Shanie.\n\n'Everywhere we had seen before had been really poky and we couldn't do much with it.'\n\nThe sitting room, pictured before the renovations, contained an old sofa, stained armchair and mould-covered walls. After plaster was put in to stop the damp the whole room was stripped before it was re-painted to block the damp, re-tiled and had new furniture installed\n\nShanie said that as they did the re-decoration themselves they were able to spend money on adding nice finishing touches such as cushions and pictures for the bedroom (pictured)\n\nAfter undertaking the work the couple set up their own company called His and Hers Renovations & Interiors, offering to re-do other people's homes. Pictured is the kitchen area following the renovation works\n\n'The house would have been a bit mediocre if we brought in a team', Shanie said, 'as a lot of the costs would have been on labour, meaning that we couldn't buy finishing touches it that we wanted'.\n\n'I enjoyed mood boards, seeing how all the colours work together and the interior designing.\n\n'I loved the process of making the look and adding beautiful things like a marble sink, bedding and cushions.'\n\nTony said that his favourite bit was the demolition, particularly taking a sledgehammer to the decrepit fittings.\n\n'I also enjoyed working out how to re-configure it', he said.\n\nThe flat has been revalued at an estimated \u00a3350,000 and re-mortgaged so that the couple could buy a second challenging property which, Shanie said, looked like 'the 70s had thrown up all over it' and had a major asb estos problem.\n\nThey also set up company His and Hers Renovations & Interiors together, offering their restoration services to people with houses in need of tender loving care.\n\nShanie is launching her own podcast Inflence Me at the end of this month, which will talk to influencers to find 'the person behind the media'.\n\nTony has started working with kids that have emotional problems, and the pair continue to run their business together.", "description": "TV presenter Shanie Ryan, 35, and her partner Tony Sinclair, 34, have converted a small two-bedroom basement flat in Croydon, London, into a dream home after buying it for \u00a3217,000.", "authors": ["Luke Andrews For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/15/19793100-0-image-a-67_1571237942203.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
