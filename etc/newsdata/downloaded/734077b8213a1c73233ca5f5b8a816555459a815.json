I\u2019d really be surprised to see any projects of significance being announced in the near term,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2014 With files from Chris Varcoe\n\nBKaufmann@postmedia.com\n\nTwitter: @BillKaufmannjrn", "description": "A number of staffers could be seen leaving the company\u2019s office tower to a lineup of waiting taxis, clutching paperwork suggesting they\u2019ve been let go", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/0110_biz_attic_husky.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
