But the former vice-president\u2019s reference to a \u201crecord player\u201d prompted, along with many Twitter jokes, yet another moment of: \u201cWhat is he talking about?\u201d The debate\u2019s most divisive moment came when the ex-Obama cabinet official Juli\u00e1n Castro accused Biden of flip-flopping on healthcare by repeatedly asking him: \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d The question elicited gasps from the audience and brought to mind Biden\u2019s repeated gaffes in recent weeks. He has, for example, mixed up the locations of recent mass shootings and misidentified the state he was campaigning in. (Though it later appeared Castro had mischaracterized Biden\u2019s original comments.)\n\nWarren v Biden: never really happened\n\nThe biggest question going into Houston was whether Biden and the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who were meeting on a debate stage for the first time, would go after each other. The answer turned out to be: not so much. With the exception of Biden\u2019s fumbled reference to \u201cthe senator to my left\u201d at the beginning of the debate, the pair focused on defending their proposals more than anything else. Meanwhile, the other top-polling progressive candidate, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, inserted himself into many of the night\u2019s most policy-driven discussions on healthcare and foreign policy, though he was hampered by a raspy voice caused by a cold.\n\nA narrowed field improves debate\n\nThe narrowed debate field undeniably changed the dynamics of the event as so many of the also-rans were denied the oxygen of publicity their campaigns desperately need. Without the 10 additional minor candidates spread across two nights, there appeared to be fewer desperate attempts for attention and more calls to unify as one Democratic field and not attack each other. Though that suggestion didn\u2019t sit well with the sharp-elbowed Castro, who told the South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg at one point: \u201cThat\u2019s called an election.\u201d\n\nBeto breaks out\n\nOf the lower-polling candidates, the former Texas congresswoman Beto O\u2019Rourke appeared to have the most standout moments. His answers about gun control, coming just a month after the mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, attracted enthusiastic applause from the audience, and O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign said it had the best hour of fundraising this quarter during the debate.\n\nObama wins debate?\n\nOne clear winner of tonight\u2019s debate: Barack Obama. Candidates such as California senator Kamala Harris and Castro started several answers by applauding the work done by the former president\u2019s administration \u2013 which was quite a contrast from the second debate, after which Biden complained that some of his opponents were disparaging Obama\u2019s legacy.", "description": "Biden was Biden but despite a smaller field sparks failed to fly with Warren, while O\u2019Rourke had a good night \u2013 as did Obama", "authors": ["Joan E Greve"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e01cff3bd03162c28e106bf03e7ab8adc464b82f/0_55_3880_2328/master/3880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=12b35a0640b5fd026f71ccfc6c361f6c", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
