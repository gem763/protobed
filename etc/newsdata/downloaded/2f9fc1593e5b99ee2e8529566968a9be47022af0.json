But if your retirement plan includes making a move, renting might be a sweeter financial and lifestyle fit.\n\nAmong households with someone at least 65 years old, 8 in 10 are homeowners, according to Harvard\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies. Yet retirement sometimes calls for flexibility, whether that\u2019s the ability to downsize in your current location, relocate to be closer to the kids and grandkids, or chase better weather and/or a lower cost of living in another state. And these moves become harder if they necessitate putting your home on the market.\n\nUse Your Gains to Stretch Your Retirement Savings\n\nWhile homeownership is the dominant housing choice, more seniors are renting today. An analysis of government data by RENTcafe reports that the percentage of renters at least 60 years old increased more than 40% in the 10 years through 2017. That exceeded the 31% growth rate for homeowners of the same age. And some big cities saw more than double the average renter gain: renters ages 60+ rose more than 80% over the decade in Austin, Phoenix, Fort Worth, and Jacksonville.\n\nIf the cost of renting is lower than your annual housing costs, that\u2019s obviously a financial win. (Factor a 3% annual rent increase into your calculations.) Moreover, if you have a boatload of equity in the home, selling today and renting means you could pile your gains from the sale into your pot of retirement savings. The profit from the sale can make it easier to delay starting Social Security until age 70 to lock in the highest possible benefit.\n\nThe first $250,000 in capital gains from the sale of a home you have lived in for at least two of the past five years is tax free. (The capital gains exclusion is $500,000 for married couples filing a joint tax return). Even better, your cost-basis can be increased by the value of capital improvements you made to the house.\n\n\u201cWhen someone wants to retire and is on the edge of not being able to have the lifestyle they want or fears running out of money in their 90\u2019s, I recommend they consider renting,\u201d says Maria Erickson, a certified financial planner in St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\nErickson says selling sooner rather than later may be smart, given we\u2019re long into an economic recovery that has lifted real estate markets in most parts of the country. \u201cIn a recession, your home value can go down, and selling becomes harder.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t Underestimate the Cost of Home Ownership\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about selling your home and buying another, make sure you\u2019re realistic about the costs involved. Plan to own without a mortgage? Great, but remember you\u2019ve still got property tax, maintenance and insurance to contend with.\n\n\u201cWhen people come to me with a budget, the number one missing item is home maintenance,\u201d says John Crumrine, a certified financial planner based in Shallote, N.C. He says clients lose track of how much they spend on this because it\u2019s not a fixed monthly outlay. He advises budgeting 1% to 2% of your home\u2019s value for annual maintenance costs, and adjusting it for inflation.\n\nMoreover, you may find that home projects and chores that are DIY today\u2014garden and lawn maintenance, swapping the storm windows in and out, gutter cleaning etc. \u2013 may become difficult down the line. Hiring help for those chores will add to your ownership expense.\n\nCarefully consider the rising cost of property tax if you live in an area where property values tend to increase at a strong pace. You should also review your 2018 federal tax bill. That was the first year the $10,000 limit on state and local tax (SALT) deductions \u2013which includes your property tax tab \u2013 was in play. If the limited SALT deduction caused your bill to rise, and you are concerned about that cost in retirement, selling and renting may improve your after-tax cash flow.\n\nHomeowner\u2019s insurance can also become a rising cost. Erickson says in Florida, climate change and the potential impact on homeowner\u2019s and flood insurance is increasingly on the radar of her retiree clients.\n\nAnother red flag for those considering a new home purchase in retirement is if you will need a sizable mortgage. Crumrine says if you have plenty of guaranteed income \u2013Social Security, a pension, perhaps an annuity\u2014he doesn\u2019t have a problem with retirees carrying a mortgage. But that presumes you make a down payment of at least 20% to 30%. A reality of retirement is that you may find yourself needing to move unexpectedly at some point due to changing health. \u201cA down payment of 5% or 10% is a red flag,\u201d he says.\n\nStory continues", "description": "For an increasing number of retirees, there's a new American dream.", "authors": ["Carla Fried"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0CD1G0ZWhDtYINW0R1d2uw--~B/aD0xOTIwO3c9Mjg4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/money_403/9b4625fb04f27397a6f083e6249327e2", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
