This corroborates President Donald Trump\u2019s earlier assertion via Twitter post Thursday that \u201cIt is expected that China will be buying large amounts of our agricultural products.\u201d\n\nSuch a move would provide some respite to U.S. farmers, who have become one of the biggest casualties in the trade war with China. It would also be viewed as a major gesture of good will, with Trump having repeatedly lambasted the Beijing for failing to follow through on promises, including upping purchases of U.S. farm products. The country had ceased purchases in August in an apparent retaliatory move after Trump announced further tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\nThis all comes after some Trump administration officials were reported Thursday to be mulling an interim trade deal with China to de-escalate tensions ahead of another round of trade talks in October. In remarks to reporters, Trump said he \u201cwould consider\u201d a temporary deal, but would prefer a more permanent agreement.\n\nThroughout the week, the U.S. and China have been exchanging olive branches in moves to de-escalate the trade war, which has taken a bite out of both countries\u2019 economies. Earlier Trump pushed back the implementation date for additional tariffs on Chinese imports to Oct. 15, two weeks later than previously announced, after China generated a list of 16 U.S. product categories to be exempted from new tariffs.\n\nTraders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 12, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid More\n\nRisk assets have responded positively to the developments, with U.S. equities on track for a third straight weekly advance as trade fears at least temporarily abate. The S&P 500 closed Thursday\u2019s session near a record high, coming within 1% of its record close reached in July.\n\nMeanwhile, government bond yields in the U.S. and Europe continued their march higher, and gold prices earlier in the session fell below $1,500.00 per ounce, as a selloff in safe havens took hold. This came even after the European Central Bank (ECB) unveiled a package of new stimulus measures Thursday, including a cut to the bank\u2019s key deposit rate. The ECB also announced it would be relaunching a quantitative easing program to help shore up the flagging eurozone economy.\n\nRetail sales rose more-than-expected in August\n\nA broad measure of retail sales rose at a greater-than-expected rate in August, driven by sales from internet retailers, building materials sellers and auto dealers.\n\nHeadline retail sales rose 0.4% in August, the Commerce Department reported Friday, versus a 0.2% gain expected, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.\n\nExcluding autos and gas sales, retail sales rose just 0.1% for the month, missing expectations for a 0.2% gain and coming off a 0.9% increase in July. Excluding motor vehicles and parts sales alone, retail sales were flat for the month, versus a 0.1% increase expected and 1.0% gain in July.\n\nAugust\u2019s figures come on the heels of a much stronger-than-expected report from July, when headline retail sales rose an upwardly revised 0.8% for the month. Gains for July had been broad-based, driven by strong sales from e-commerce platforms, grocery stores and clothing retailers.\n\nWhile Friday\u2019s report marked a pullback from July\u2019s print, the results still point to intact consumer activity even amid an ongoing trade war and fears of an economic slowdown. Consumer spending drives about 70% of U.S. economic output, and retail sales comprise about 25% of personal consumption expenditures.", "description": "The Dow paced toward an eighth consecutive session of gains amid further signs of de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.", "authors": ["Emily Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/879Lc5K324R_Lyh0sStwxw--~B/aD0zOTM3O3c9NTkwNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/4c92cc50-d61f-11e9-b7e6-39736b78c25c", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
