a draft leaflet for the upcoming European parliament elections.\n\nSome 90 MPs and MEPs signed a letter urging Labour\u2019s ruling body to give a clear commitment to a public vote when it meets on Tuesday to decide on the party\u2019s manifesto.\n\nBut when asked if it was crucial for Labour support, Ms Long-Bailey said the leadership were \u201cnot being hugely prescriptive on the minute detail of specific elements, because we are willing to compromise and we are willing to be flexible\u201d.\n\nPressed on whether it was a \u201cred line\u201d, she said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t couch it in terms of a second referendum but our party policy has always been that firstly we want to get a Brexit deal that puts our economy and living standards first and protects our environmental protections, workplace protections, health and safety standards.\n\n\u201cWe want a customs union arrangement in order to keep our borders open, so that our manufacturing industry isn\u2019t detrimentally affected, and we keep the movement of goods as freely flowing as possible. And we want a strong single market relationship.\u201d\n\nMs Long-Bailey also hit back at claims from the Conservatives that her side has been stalling, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re certainly not dragging our heels.\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We\u2019re having further discussions this week and hopefully we\u2019ll see some movement but at the moment we are focusing on the detail where we stand in relation to our relevant positions and where we could move to.\u201d\n\nHer comments are likely to disappoint pro-EU MPs and MEPs who had been lobbying to make a referendum a central strand of Labour\u2019s European elections campaign.\n\nShadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show that the manifesto is going to be agreed by the National Executive Committee (NEC), but he expected it would endorse Labour\u2019s conference policy.\n\nIn a sign of the Brexit divisions plaguing Labour's top team, deputy Labour leader Tom Watson encouraged members to lobby NEC representatives \"if you want them to support a confirmatory ballot on a Brexit deal\".\n\nBut shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said those pushing for a referendum on any Brexit deal were seeking a change in Labour policy.\n\nThe party's policy agreed at conference was for a referendum \"to stop a no-deal or to stop a bad Theresa May deal\", he told BBC 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics.\n\nIn a letter to the NEC organised by the Love Socialism Hate Brexit campaign, the MPs and MEPs said Labour had \u201ca clear opportunity to win these elections\u201d if it fully supports a Final Say vote.\n\nThey wrote: \u201cThese elections are about the kind of Europe we want to live in, and we can\u2019t make a convincing case in them without being clear about Brexit. Labour has already, rightly, backed a confirmatory public vote.\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming majority of our members and voters support this, and it is the democratically established policy of the party.\n\n\u201cOur members need to feel supported on doorsteps by a clear manifesto that marks us out as the only viable alternative to Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party.\u201d\n\nA Labour spokesperson said: \u201cThere are a number of different texts for different leaflets in circulation, including for a freepost and for other campaign purposes. They all reflect existing party policy.\n\n\u201cOur manifesto for the European elections will be decided next Tuesday.\u201d\n\nThe Independent has been campaigning for a Final Say vote on any Brexit deal, which has attracted the support of more than a million people since its launch last year.", "description": "Labour could sign up to a Brexit deal without a fresh\u00a0referendum attached if the government makes significant concessions in the ongoing talks, the\u00a0shadow business secretary has suggested.
