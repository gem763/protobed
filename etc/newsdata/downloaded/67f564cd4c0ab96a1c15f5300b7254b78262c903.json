But some locals lament that many day-trippers come for a quick selfie and then return to the city and don\u2019t spend much money in towns along the way.\n\n\u201cWhat we would like to see is fewer tourists but spending longer here \u2026 exploring the other wonders that the area has to offer,\u201d Aireys Inlet and District Association\u2019s president, Charlotte Allen, says.\n\nThere have also been safety concerns raised about international drivers after multiple fatal road smashes.\n\nGreat Ocean Road at risk from erosion and rising sea levels, report finds Read more\n\n\u201cOne of the real pressure point places is at the memorial arch,\u201d Allen says. \u201cParking is limited and there are no toilet facilities. All the big buses leave Melbourne at the same time and they all want to stop at the memorial arch to get a photo. It just becomes absolutely crazy with people standing in the middle of the road and people using the bushes for toilets. It\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d\n\nHer association has called on authorities to undertake a study to determine whether the region\u2019s peak tourism capacity has been reached and consider measures such as tolls to limit numbers.\n\nFillmore says the road is no longer fit to cope with today\u2019s traffic.\n\n\u201cWhen they built the road they probably didn\u2019t put a lot of base material on it thinking that it was just going to be for Model T Fords and horse and carts,\u201d he says.\n\nAlthough federal and state governments have given $150m in recent years to fixing landslips, Fillmore believes tourists should be helping to maintain the road.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re passing through a national park to get here,\u201d he says. \u201cVirtually everywhere else in the world where you enter a very popular national park you pay a fee. Every tourist who comes down that road should be paying at least $20.\u201d\n\nHe says a ban or limit on the big 50- to 60-seat coach buses should be considered. \u201cThe really big buses weigh a lot and you can see they\u2019re damaging the road,\u201d he says.\n\nClimate change impact\n\nVictoria\u2019s south-west coast has always been a treacherous part of the world. More than 200 shipwrecks lie off the coast.\n\nIn 1802 the explorer Matthew Flinders said he had \u201cseldom seen a more fearful section of coastline\u201d and the climate emergency has the potential to make conditions even rougher.\n\nA University of Melbourne ocean engineering expert, Ian Young, says by 2050 the average sea level rise could be 60cm along Victoria\u2019s south-west coast.\n\n\u201cOur work shows by 2100 you can expect extreme storm waves in the Southern Ocean to increase [in height] by between 10 and 15%,\u201d he says.\n\nAsked if this could mean the loss of more of the 12 Apostles Young says: \u201cIt\u2019s quite possible there could be some more natural erosion of those sorts of coastal features, yes.\u201d\n\nYoung says low pressure systems that come across the Southern Ocean are intensifying and this has implications for tides and sand dunes.\n\n\u201cThe winds are getting stronger and that accounts for the higher wave conditions, and also those low-pressure systems are tracking further to the south and what that does is it means the waves will come from a slightly more southerly direction,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf the wave direction changes you\u2019ll see a change in orientation of the coastline as well. If you have a long beach and the wave conditions change two or three degrees then the alignment of the beach will change. This may not seem like much \u2026 [but] the change in orientation of the coastline will cause erosion in some parts of the beaches.\u201d\n\nYoung says a lack of data makes it difficult to know whether storm surges will increase on the Victorian south-west coast.\n\nGeomorphologist Neville Rosengren and geotechnical engineer Tony Miner looked at erosion around the Apollo Bay and Mounts Bay areas over the past two years for a independent report released last October.\n\nThey warned the state government \u201cthe Great Ocean Road could potentially be compromised in less than a decade and possibly within five years\u201d.\n\nIndigenous cultural heritage at risk\n\nAt beaches along the Great Ocean Road there are scores of shell middens which in some cases date back 5,000 years.\n\nThese Aboriginal cultural heritage sites mark where Indigenous people would cook and eat abalone, periwinkle sea snails, mussels and spoon fish shells. Ancient tools have also been found. But the sites are starting to wash away.\n\nGuli-Gad elder Ron Arnold says dozens of middens have already been destroyed and damaged.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t protect all of them \u2026 There are some that are a little more inaccessible,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are certain ones that could be highlighted for tourism and education. They\u2019re the ones that we\u2019re looking to protect and preserve for the future.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Twelve Apostles on Victoria\u2019s Great Ocean Road.

The concept was the brainchild of the then-Geelong mayor, Howard Hitchcock, and Victorian residents funded it themselves through tolls to help create jobs for veterans returning from the first world war.\n\nA member of the Lorne historical society, Peter Spring, says 3,000 returned servicemen worked on the most difficult stretch from Eastern View to Apollo Bay which winds around cliffs. The men were hanging by ropes using picks and shovels to cut into the cliffs.\n\n\u201cThere were no explosives used in the first few years, mainly because a lot of the servicemen returning from war were suffering from shell shock,\u201d Spring says. \u201cIt was hard work done by hand.\u201d\n\nThe men worked in gruelling cold, windy and soggy conditions.\n\n\u201cIn fact there\u2019s one section of the road at the start of the climb at the Otway Ranges which they referred to as the Somme, named after the battlefield in western France where the conditions were appalling,\u201d Spring says.\n\nRemarkably there were no casualties in the construction, which was completed in 1932.\n\nRescue efforts\n\nThe Victorian government released an action plan last October. It is also establishing an independent authority to preserve the road and coastal environment.\n\nThe Victorian roads minister, Jaala Pulford, says modern technology helps engineers monitor conditions.\n\n\u201cDrone surveying has allowed geotechnical engineers to model the terrain above and below the road, capturing steep cliff faces, historical landslip sites and areas previously inaccessible to surveyors,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cRock armour walls are being constructed beneath the road and along the foreshore to help protect the road from the impacts of coastal erosion, while high-tech weather stations are providing rainfall and soil moisture content data to help engineers measure the impacts of these factors on the cliff faces above and below the road.\u201d\n\nPulford says rock netting, soil nailing and erosion control matting are also being rolled out to stabilise the embankments to help prevent loose rockfall.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lorne beach on the Great Ocean Road Photograph: Justin Hannaford/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nCycling haven\n\nThe Great Ocean Road has a special place in the heart of 2011 Tour de France champion Cadel Evans, who has a home at Barwon Heads, near Geelong.\n\nDespite riding professionally all over the world Evans says the Great Ocean Road is one of his favourite cycling routes.\n\n\u201cIt is so spectacular. You don\u2019t realise how good this country is until you live overseas \u2013 the smell of the eucalypts, the clear skies, the people are friendly and when the sun is shining, it is just beautiful,\u201d he told Jetstar travel magazine earlier this year.", "description": "With 6.1 million tourists taking the famous scenic drive in southwest Victoria in a year locals say the road cannot cope", "authors": ["Lisa Martin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f781732d3d4dea952a4f50df1b71ec8acd790875/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=be5c503346c3a16e6d2de63b4e99439c", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
