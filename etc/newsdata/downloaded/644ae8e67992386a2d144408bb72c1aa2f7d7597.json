Col. Vindman tells impeachment investigators he twice raised concerns over Trump\u2019s push for Ukraine investigations", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Defying White House orders, an Army officer serving with President Donald Trump\u2019s National Security Council testified to impeachment investigators Tuesday that he twice raised concerns over Trump\u2019s push to have Ukraine investigate Democrats and Joe Biden.\n\nAlexander Vindman, a lieutenant colonel who served in Iraq and later as a diplomat, is the first official to testify who actually heard Trump\u2019s July 25 call with new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He reported his concerns to the NSC\u2019s lead counsel, he said in his prepared remarks.\n\n\u2018I was concerned by the call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine.\u2019 Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman\n\nHis arrival in military blue, with medals, created a striking image at the Capitol as the impeachment inquiry reached deeper into the White House.\n\n\u201cI was concerned by the call,\u201d Vindman said, according to his testimony obtained by the Associated Press. \u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nVindman, a 20-year military officer, added to the mounting evidence from other witnesses \u2014 diplomats, defense and former administration officials \u2014 who are corroborating the initial whistleblower\u2019s complaint against Trump and providing new details ahead of a House vote in the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cEvery person has put it in higher resolution,\u201d said Rep. Denny Heck, D-Wash., during a break in the day-long session.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the story: There\u2019s not like a new headline out of all of these,\u201d said Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J. \u201cEvery single witness, from their own advantage point, has corroborated the central facts of the story we\u2019ve heard.\u201d\n\n\u2018Every single witness, from their own advantage point, has corroborated the central facts of the story we\u2019ve heard.\u2019 Rep. Tom Malinowski\n\nThe inquiry is looking into Trump\u2019s call, in which he asked Zelensky for a \u201cfavor\u201d \u2014 to investigate Democrats \u2014 that the Democrats say was a quid pro quo for military aid and could be an impeachable offense.\n\nWith the administration directing staff not to appear, Vindman was the first current White House official to testify before the impeachment panels. He was issued a subpoena to appear.\n\nTrump took to Twitter Tuesday to denounce the probe as a \u201csham,\u201d adding: \u201cWhy are people that I never even heard of testifying about the call. Just READ THE CALL TRANSCRIPT AND THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX IS OVER!\u201d\n\nVindman, who arrived in the United States as a 3-year-old from the former Soviet Union, said that it was his \u201csacred duty\u201d to defend the United States.\n\nSome Trump allies, looking for ways to discredit Vindman, questioned the colonel\u2019s loyalties because he was born in the region. But the line of attack was rejected by some Republicans, including Rep. Liz Cheney, who said it was \u201cshameful\u201d to criticize his patriotism.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah called the slams on Vindman \u201cabsurd, disgusting and way off the mark. This is a decorated American soldier and he should be given the respect that his service to our country demands.\u201d\n\nThe testimony came the day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House would vote on a resolution to set rules for public hearings and a possible vote on articles of impeachment.\n\nThursday\u2019s vote would be the first on the impeachment inquiry and aims to nullify complaints from Trump and his allies that the process is illegitimate and unfair.\n\nUnpersuaded, Republican Rep Lee Zeldin of New York said, \u201cThis process which was illegitimate today and was illegitimate yesterday is apparently going to be just as illegitimate on Thursday when they have this vote. This resolution should go down in flames.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he and other GOP lawmakers will review the House resolution to see if it passes a \u201csmell test\u201d of fairness to Trump.\n\nThe session Tuesday grew contentious at times as House Republicans continued trying to unmask the still-anonymous whistleblower and call him or her to testify. Vindman said he is not the whistleblower and does not know who it is.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan of Ohio acknowledged Republicans were trying to get Vindman to provide the names of others he spoke to after the July 25 phone call, in an effort to decide whom to call to testify. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nIn his prepared remarks, Vindman testified that this spring he became aware of \u201coutside influencers\u201d promoting a \u201cfalse narrative of Ukraine\u201d that undermined U.S. efforts, a reference in particular to Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.\n\nHe first reported his concerns after a July 10 meeting in which U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland stressed the importance of having Ukraine investigate the 2016 election as well as Burisma, a company linked to the family of Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nVindman says he told Sondland that \u201chis statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push.\u201d\n\nThat differs from the account of Sondland, a wealthy businessman who donated $1 million to Trump inauguration and testified before the impeachment investigators that no one from the NSC \u201cever expressed any concerns.\u201d Sondland also testified that he did not realize any connection between Biden and Burisma.\n\nFor the call between Trump and Zelensky, Vindman said he listened in the Situation Room with colleagues from the NSC and Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s office. He said he again reported his concerns to the NSC\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nSee: Pence counseled against release of transcript of Trump call with Ukraine\u2019s Zelensky\n\n\n\nAlso: Secretary of State Pompeo listened in on Trump\u2019s July call with Ukraine\u2019s Zelensky\n\nHe wrote, \u201cI realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. This would all undermine U.S. national security.\u201d\n\nVindman served as the director for European affairs and a Ukraine expert under Fiona Hill, a former official who testified earlier in the impeachment probe. Hill worked for former national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nHe told investigators that Ukraine, in trying to become a vibrant democracy integrated with the West, is a bulwark against overt Russian aggression.\n\nVindman attended Zelensky\u2019s inauguration with a delegation led by Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and he and Hill were both part of a Ukraine briefing with Sondland that others have testified irritated Bolton at the White House.\n\n\u201cI am a patriot, and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend OUR country, irrespective of party or politics,\u201d wrote Vindman, who was wounded in Iraq and awarded a Purple Heart.\n\n\u201cFor over twenty years as an active duty United States military officer and diplomat, I have served this country in a nonpartisan manner, and have done so with the utmost respect and professionalism for both Republican and Democratic administrations,\u201d he wrote.\n\nRead on: Trump attacks Schiff over portrayal of Zelensky call", "description": "Alexander Vindman, a lieutenant colonel who served in Iraq and later as a diplomat, is the first official to testify who actually heard Trump\u2019s July 25 call...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU267_vindma_ZG_20191029175121.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
