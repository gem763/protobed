Unfortunately this was another opportunity foregone for now\u201d, he added.\n\nOthers said more rate cuts could be on the cards in December as officials try to ramp up rural consumption and economic activity.\n\n\u2013 Room for more \u2013\n\n\u201cDemand in India is abysmally low and GST (goods and services tax) returns were at an 18-month-low in August, reflecting muted consumption demand,\u201d Garima Kapoor, economist at Elara Capital, told AFP.\n\n\u201cRBI has room for rate cuts in the range of 15-30 basis points in December as per benign inflation dynamics\u201d, she added.\n\nInflation rose to a 10-month high in August but was within the RBI\u2019s target range of four percent.\n\nDespite the succession of cuts, economists say banks have failed to pass on the benefits to consumers, meaning borrowing costs for loans remain high.\n\nIndia has the world\u2019s worst bad-loan ratio, prompting the government to announce a $10-billion liquidity lifeline to public-sector banks in this year\u2019s budget.\n\nIn June, economic growth slowed for the fifth straight quarter to 5.0 percent, according to official figures.\n\nIn August, the once-booming auto sector \u2014 seen as a crucial barometer of economic health \u2014 reported slumping sales for the 10th-straight month, forcing companies to shut down manufacturing plants.\n\nDesperate to ramp up investment, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman last month announced corporate tax rates for domestic firms would be slashed by almost a third to 30 percent, making it one of the lowest in the region.\n\nExperts say the tax reforms are aimed at attracting companies spooked by the China-US trade war.\n\nAuthorities have in recent weeks rolled out a series of measures to boost the economy and battle grinding unemployment, which is at its highest since the 1970s.", "description": "Mumbai (AFP) \u2013 India\u2019s central bank on Friday cut interest rates for the fifth time this year, putting them at a near-decade low, while it", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/61ada1_rates-are-now-lowest-level-2010-india-central-bank-rate-cut-slashes-growth-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
