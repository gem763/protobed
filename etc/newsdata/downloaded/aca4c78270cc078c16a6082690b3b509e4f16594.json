Taboola president & COO Eldad Maniv and Outbrain co-CEO David Kostman will manage the integration, while Outbrain co-founder and co-CEO Yaron Galai will stay on for at least 12 months after the closing.\n\nTaboola is trying to create an alternative to Facebook and Google\n\nBoth started in Israel and now New York-based, Taboola and Outbrain use widgets to place recommended links to articles, videos, and products across hundreds of publisher websites (including Business Insider), like those \"Sponsored\" posts that appear near the bottom of many articles. They make money by sending traffic to publishers' sites and placing ads in those widgets, and reports of the companies merging have made the rounds for years.\n\nBoth have also been criticized for enabling the spread of clickbait and fake news in the widgets, causing some publishers and brands to distance themselves from the companies.\n\nTaboola has billed itself as an alternative to Google and Facebook over the years, trying to own discovery the way that the tech giants dominate search and social advertising. As Google and Facebook dominate digital advertising revenue and regulatory calls for their break up grow louder, the need for them to come together was stronger than ever, said Singolda.\n\n\"There's so much focus on Google and Facebook being too big that it's almost like a rallying cry from the industry to create more choice,\" he said. \"We hope that this is a huge win for the industry, giving small and big advertisers more choice in terms of where they can run their ads online and in turn, help to grow revenue for publishers.\"\n\nSingolda said Taboola and Outbrain made more than $2 billion in revenue in 2018 combined and that the new company would have more than 2,000 employees across 23 offices, with more than 20,000 clients including advertisers like Pandora and Whirlpool and publishers like CNN and The Washington Post.\n\nTaboola has raised $157 million from investors including Fidelity Investments, Marker, and Steadfast Capital, while Outbrain has raised $150 million in funding from Index Ventures, Viola Ventures, and Lightspeed Venture Partners, among others, according to The Wall Street Journal.", "description": "The combined company will operate as Taboola, with Outbrain shareholders receiving 30% of the shares and $250 million in cash.", "authors": ["Tanya Dua"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/54d22de76bb3f78a347bb1d4?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
