Nelson (knee) out with injuries.\n\nThe Bills drafted Jones in the second round out of East Carolina in 2017, the 37th player taken overall. He played in 31 of Buffalo's 32 games over the previous two seasons, making 25 starts. In 2018, when he played in all 16 games and started 15 of them, he finished with 56 catches for 652 yards and seven touchdowns.\n\nJones has seven catches for 69 yards this season, all posted in Buffalo's first four games.\n\nThe Bills perhaps signaled their willingness to part with Jones on Sunday by bringing up a practice squad player, Duke Williams, and giving him Jones' spot. Williams was on the field for 51 snaps and made four catches against the Tennessee Titans, while Jones played just one snap with no completions.\n\nJones is perhaps more known for an incident in Los Angeles in March 2018 when he was arrested on suspicion of felony vandalism.\n\nTMZ posted video that purportedly showed a naked Jones struggling with his brother, Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Cayleb Jones, in the hallway of a building. The clothed man is trying to control the naked man, who is heard saying, \"I'm going to fight for Jesus.\"\n\nBroken windows and blood-covered walls are subsequently seen in the video.\n\nProsecutors declined to prosecute Zay Jones for felony vandalism because of \"insufficient evidence.\"\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "The Oakland Raiders are dealing for Buffalo Bills third-year wide receiver Zay  Jones, according a report Monday night from ESPN's Chris Mortensen.The Bills...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
