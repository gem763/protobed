Kamala Harris (D-CA) with obviously fake allegations of an extramarital affair.\n\nAnd like past efforts to manufacture sexual claims against Trump foes\u2014from Robert Mueller, to Pete Buttigieg, to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)\u2014the Harris charade fell apart quickly.\n\nThe pair\u2019s bogus accuser\u201426-year-old Sean Newaldass\u2014told The Daily Beast on Friday that he had no idea the event in which he alleged that he was in a romantic dalliance with the Senate was real. That\u2019s because Newaldass had met Wohl and Burkman by replying to an ad posted on Craigslist seeking a \u201cmale actor\u201d for \u201cperformance art.\u201d When he showed up at Burkman\u2019s Virginia home and delivered his lines alleging an affair, Newaldass was under the belief that the press conference was actually an audition for a Spike TV show. He said he had no idea that Harris was a politician. Indeed, he assumed she was a fictional person.\n\n\u201cI thought I was acting for a role in a movie, like a role in a TV series,\u201d Newaldass said. \u201cI thought everything was staged, I\u2019m thinking everyone is an actor.\u201d\n\nJacob Wohl Faked Death Threats Against Himself\n\nNewaldass insists that he believed that everyone at the event, from Wohl and Burkman, to the reporters asking questions, and a heckler dressed as a corncob, were all actors. Wohl promised Newaldass $500 to appear at the event\u2014money that Newaldass said he still has yet to receive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking this is going to be like The Office,\u201d Newaldass said. \u201cThe Office has super dry humor.\u201d\n\nNewaldass\u2019s allegations are shocking even by Wohl and Burkman\u2019s standards. The duo are known for hamfisted attempts to manufacture smears against political figures and for roping unwitting participants into their schemes. But they have never concocted a fake TV show in order to execute their plans before.\n\nAs Newaldass realized Wednesday afternoon that the event was real, and that he was being treated as an outright liar on social media, he said he became afraid to leave his home.\n\n\u201cTo me, it was the most hurt I\u2019ve ever received from anything in the world,\u201d Newaldass said.\n\nAsked over Instagram direct message whether he had tricked Newaldass, Wohl responded with only a laughing-crying emoji. Burkman, a lawyer and lobbyist whose membership in the D.C. Bar was recently suspended over unpaid dues, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nJacob Wohl\u2019s Bogus Warren Accuser Exaggerated His Military Service Record\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time one of Wohl and Burkman\u2019s fake accusers has turned on them. Their Mueller accuser, Carolyne Cass, failed to show up at a much-hyped press conference and later said Wohl and Burkman had made up the claims. College student Hunter Kelly, whose name Burkman and Wohl used to accuse Buttigieg of sexual assault, turned on the pair even faster than Cass, sending out mocking tweets about their press conference announcing his claims as it happened. Their missteps don\u2019t end there. Wohl is set to be arraigned on a felony charge for unlawful sale of securities later this month in California.\n\nNewaldass said he first entered Wohl\u2019s orbit by replying to the Craigslist ad, which makes no mention of politics, Burkman and Wohl, or Harris. Shortly after responding, according to Newaldass, he was contacted by Burkman and Wohl. The phone number that Newaldass said Wohl used to contact him is the same as a number Wohl has used in the past to text and make phones call to a reporter at The Daily Beast.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Wohl and Burkman got Newaldass an Uber to Burkman\u2019s home in Rosslyn, Virginia. Newaldass said he was told the house belonged to Spike TV, a network that no longer exists after parent company Viacom changed the channel\u2019s name to the Paramount Network in 2018.\n\n\u201cI was told, \u2018This is the audition for a TV show that\u2019s going to be on Spike,\u2019\u201d Newaldass said. \u201cAnd I can be a personal trainer on the show, right?\u201d\n\nNewaldass said Burkman and Wohl showed him the statement he would read on Wednesday , but described it as a \u201cscript.\u201d Newaldass found the claims in the statement bizarre, but considered that he had seen similarly strange things in other movies and TV shows.", "description": "Inept conservative operatives Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman held another bizarre press conference in Burkman\u2019s driveway on Wednesday, this time to smear Sen.
