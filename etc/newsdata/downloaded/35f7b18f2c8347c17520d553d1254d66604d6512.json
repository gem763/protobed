REUTERS/Darren Ornitz\n\nsanctions on Chinese entities and people suspected of transferring oil from Iran, accusing Washington of \u201cbullying\u201d.\n\nChina\u2019s cooperation with Iran is legitimate and legal, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department said on Wednesday it was imposing sanctions on five Chinese nationals and six entities that it said had violated Washington\u2019s unilateral curbs on Tehran,\n\nThese included two Cosco Shipping Corporation subsidiaries, Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian and Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman and Ship Management Co Ltd.\n\n\u201cWe are telling China, and all nations: know that we will sanction every violation,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in New York on Wednesday.\n\nChina, which is already embroiled in a trade dispute with the United States, responded that its dealings with Iran were legal and should be respected.\n\n\u201cWe always oppose the so-called long arm jurisdiction and unilateral sanctions,\u201d spokesman Geng said. \u201cWe also oppose the bullying practice of the U.S.\u201d\n\nHe urged Washington \u201cto correct its wrongdoing\u201d.\n\nAttacks on Sept. 14 on Saudi Arabian oil facilities, which the United States blames on Iran, have rattled the Middle East and raised concerns about a broader war. Iran denies involvement.\n\n\u201cThe more Iran lashes out the greater our pressure will and should be,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cThat path forward begins now with two new actions.\u201d\n\nHe said Washington was also ramping up efforts to educate countries on the risks of doing business with Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps entities and said it will punish those who continue to engage with them.\n\nThe other three companies appearing on the U.S. sanction list are Hong Kong-registered China Concord Petroleum Co Ltd and Kunlun Shipping Company Ltd, and Virgin Island-registered Kunlun Holding Company Ltd.\n\nCosco Shipping and the three mentioned companies did not immediately respond to Reuters\u2019 requests for comment.\n\nIn a speech to the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations on Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would keep squeezing Iran\u2019s economy with sanctions until Tehran agrees to give up what Washington says is a pursuit of nuclear weapons.\n\nIran has said its nuclear program has always been for peaceful purposes only.\n\nLast year Trump withdrew from a 2015 international accord with Iran which had put limits on Tehran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.", "description": "China on Thursday criticised the United States for imposing new", "authors": ["Huizhong Wu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434071646&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O19C", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
