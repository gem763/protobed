It was just a bad night.\u201d\n\nWest Ham joined London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, beaten on penalties by Colchester United on Tuesday, Bournemouth and Sheffield United as top-flight scalps for lower league opponents in the competition.\n\nManager Manuel Pellegrini praised Oxford\u2019s display as his side\u2019s six-match unbeaten run ended abruptly.\n\n\u201cIf you give them time and space all of them are good players. They scored four goals, they had other chances and I think we only created one in the first ten minutes of the game and one in the last minute,\u201d Pellegrini said.\n\n\u201cWe missed too many passes from the beginning and the responsibility is first on me because I picked the players and second of course on the team that didn\u2019t compete.\u201d\n\nOxford manager Karl Robinson has history in the League Cup having masterminded a 4-0 win over Manchester United five years ago when in charge of MK Dons.\n\n\u201cLooking at the scoreboard, 4-0 against West Ham and a very strong West Ham, this will probably go down as one of the biggest results at the Kassam (Stadium) in recent years,\u201d Robinson said.", "description": "West Ham United's veteran defender Pablo Zabaleta apologised to the club's fans after the Hammers were humiliated in a 4-0 away defeat by third-tier Oxford United in the League Cup third round on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433925332&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O28V", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
