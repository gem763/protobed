I was sitting at home watching a major business television show. Early that morning, Jack Welch, the legendary head of General Electric, was about to be interviewed, when all of a sudden they cut away. At first there were different reports. \u2018It was a boiler fire,\u2019 but I knew that boilers aren\u2019t at the top of a building. \u2018It was a kitchen explosion in Windows on the World.\u2019 Nobody really knew what happened. There was great confusion. I was looking out of a window from a building in Midtown Manhattan directly at the World Trade Center when I saw a second plane at a tremendous speed go into the second tower. It was then that I realized the world was going to change.\u201d\n\n\u2014 President Trump, remarks at the Pentagon on the 18th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, Sept. 11, 2019\n\nPresident Trump has told various versions of this story, of seeing the second jet hit the World Trade Center during the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He usually says he was in Trump Tower, which is four miles from where the World Trade Center was, though in his most recent remarks, he says he was in \u201ca building in Midtown Manhattan\u201d after apparently being at home (Trump Tower) when the first plane struck.\n\nCertainly, from his vantage point in Trump Tower, he would have seen smoke billowing from the World Trade Center, but a full view might have been obscured by the Empire State Building. (Here\u2019s a photo of the view downtown from the apartment directly below Trump\u2019s apartment.)\n\nThe first plane, American Airlines Flight 11, hit 1 World Trade Center just before 8:47 a.m.; the second plane hit 2 World Trade Center at 9:03, 16 minutes later.\n\nIn his first interview after the attacks, with New Jersey station WWOR, Trump did not mention seeing the second plane. He instead referenced an explosion that he said he saw from his office: \u201cI have a window that looks directly at the World Trade Center and I saw this huge explosion. I was with a group of people. I really couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nRockefeller Center, a few blocks south of Trump Tower, with a clear view of the twin towers, certainly offered a view of the second plane hitting the tower, as can be seen in the video below.\n\nTrump, in 2015, also suggested at a campaign rally that he watched people jump from the buildings: \u201cI have a window in my apartment that specifically was aimed at the World Trade Center because of the beauty of the whole downtown Manhattan. And I watched as people jumped, and I watched the second plane come in.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, in this instance he doesn\u2019t directly say he saw people jumping, but at another campaign rally he was more explicit: \u201cMany people jumped and I witnessed it, I watched that. \u2026 I watched those people jump and I watched the second plane hit. I saw the second plane hit the building and I said, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s unbelievable.\u2019 \u201d\n\nInterestingly, in his WWOR interview, Trump says: \u201cI have somebody who was down there who witnessed at least 10 people jumping out of the building from 70 and 80 stories up in the air.\u201d He does not say he personally witnessed people jumping out of the buildings.\n\nSo the most likely explanation is that Trump saw the explosion of the second plane and heard about the jumpers, as he recounted in his first interview. But over time, he\u2019s made the story even grander.\n\nAs Trump controversies go, whether he saw the second plane or just the explosion of the second plane is relatively minor. Here\u2019s a roundup of Trump claims regarding 9/11 that are clearly false.\n\nHis building downtown was now the tallest\n\n\u201c40 Wall Street actually was the second-tallest building in downtown Manhattan, and it was actually, before the World Trade Center, was the tallest \u2014 and then, when they built the World Trade Center, it became known as the second tallest. And now it\u2019s the tallest.\"\n\n\u2014 Trump, interview with WWOR, Sept. 11, 2001\n\nThis was an odd claim to make in the midst of tragedy, but it was also wrong. As our colleague Philip Bump documented in 2018, Trump\u2019s building was not the second-tallest building in downtown Manhattan at the time. It was 25 feet shorter than 70 Pine Street, a block to the east.\n\n\u201cThere was a period during which Trump's was the tallest building in Lower Manhattan, but it wasn't immediately before the construction of the World Trade Center in the 1970s,\u201d Bump wrote. \u201cIt was for about two years in the 1930s, well before Trump owned it \u2014 or was born.\u201d\n\nHe predicted Osama bin Laden\n\n\u201cI predicted Osama bin Laden \u2026 was coming in to do damage. \u2026 In my book, I predicted terrorism. I can feel it, like I can feel good location in real estate.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Trump, in a speech during the 2016 campaign, Nov. 16, 2015\n\nIn various speeches and interviews, Trump claimed that two years before the 9/11 attacks, he warned that al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was a threat \u2014 was going to \u201cdo damage\u201d to the United States \u2014 and even predicted the rise of terrorism.\n\nThis was based on one vague reference to bin Laden in a book he issued in January 2000. Even if his claim were true, Trump would have been echoing predictions of experts, news organizations and even bin Laden himself, who in media interviews indicated that he planned to attack the United States.\n\nHere\u2019s a 1999 CNN headline: \u201cBin Laden feared to be planning terrorist attack.\u201d The article started: \u201cU.S. officials fear that suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden \u2018may be in the final stages\u2019 of planning an attack against the United States.\u201d\n\nTrump earned Four Pinocchios for this claim.\n\nHe watched thousands of Muslims cheer as the towers came down\n\n\u201cI watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Trump, at a campaign rally, Nov. 21, 2015\n\nThis is one of Trump\u2019s most notorious claims. An extensive examination of news clips and video archives turned up next to nothing. A professor had conducted extensive research into rumors of such jubilation and said it was possible that maybe six to 12 teenagers had something akin to a celebration on the morning of 9/11 in Paterson, N.J., but they quickly dispersed.\n\nAn MTV clip eventually was unearthed \u2014 some Trump supporters said it was evidence of the cheering Muslims \u2014 and it turned out that a high school senior was quoted as saying she had seen a group of kids acting up in front of the Paterson courthouse, banging on trash cans and shouting. She does not say they were Middle Eastern or Arab.\n\nTrump earned Four Pinocchios.\n\nHe spent \u2018a lot of time\u2019 at Ground Zero\n\nTrump has often suggested that he was at the center of the cleanup effort, but no evidence has emerged to support that claim. A newspaper report placed him near the scene on Sept. 14, 2001, talking on a cellphone, and a photo of him was taken on Sept. 18 outside the New York Stock Exchange. But an extensive New York Times examination of this claim found no one who could remember him playing any role in the cleanup or even supplying any workers.\n\nNevertheless, in his comments marking the 18th anniversary, Trump said: \u201cSoon after, I went down to Ground Zero with men who worked for me to try to help in any little way that we could.\u201d\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles", "description": "The president has told many tall tales related to the 2001 terrorist attacks.", "authors": ["Glenn Kessler", "The Fact Checker", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hSZAwHN5EYM_xzMehJNJWP1nS_A=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TR2LU3WUVMI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
