(Photo: Disney)\n\nThe smartphone wars meet the streaming wars.\n\nVerizon announced Tuesday that it is teaming up with Disney to give new and existing 4G LTE and 5G wireless \"unlimited\" customers a free year of the new Disney+ streaming service. The exclusive promotion coincides with the Disney+ launch on Nov. 12. New Verizon FIOS and 5G Home Internet customers will also qualify for a year of Disney+.\n\nThe new streaming service becomes the home for Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic content and promises viewers access to Disney\u2019s vast TV and movie library, as well as more than 25 original series and 10 original films and documentaries.\n\nSubscription overload: So many subscriptions. But wait, there's more\n\nOn Nov. 12, Verizon customers can activate their Disney+ subscription and start streaming on a wide selection of mobile and connected TV devices, including gaming consoles, streaming media players, and smart TVs.\n\nAs part of the deal, Verizon customers will be able to watch up to four concurrent streams, download content for offline viewing, and create up to seven profiles. Though details haven't been fully spelled out, customers who want to hold onto Disney after the 12 free months will presumably have to pay regular subscription fees, currently $6.99 a month or $69.99 a year.\n\nVerizon and Disney are teaming up on a Disney+ bundle promotion. (Photo: Verizon)\n\nVerizon Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg indicated that beyond Disney+, Verizon would bring its 5G Ultra Wideband technology to the Disney Innovation Studios, as well as to the Disney theme parks.\n\nThe Disney+ launch will come nearly two weeks after Apple\u2019s own Apple+ streaming service kicks off on Nov. 1. For its part, Apple is giving customers who buy a new iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple TV box a full year of that service for free.Wireless carriers have traditionally teamed up with TV and content partners to offer various incentives to attract and keep customers. AT&T has run various promotions with its DirecTV and HBO properties. T-Mobile customers have gotten a year of Netflix. Sprint has offered Hulu.\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow @edbaig on Twitter\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/22/verizon-bundle-wireless-deal-get-disney-plus-free/4060672002/", "description": "Verizon is giving 4G LTE, 5G and FIOS customers a free year of Disney's new Disney+ streaming service, when the service launches Nov. 12.", "authors": ["Edward C.
