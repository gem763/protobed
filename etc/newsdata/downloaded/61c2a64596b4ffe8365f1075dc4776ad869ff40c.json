Kurdish forces are also guarding as many as 12,000 ISIS fighters in makeshift prisons and thousands of ISIS sympathizers in the al-Hol refugee camp.\n\nThus far in the fighting:\n\nThe Turkish military reports 342 Kurdish casualties, although the SDF put that number much lower, at about 22 deaths.\n\nThere are about 100,000 displaced people attempting to flee the clashes.\n\nThe Turkish military reports that it has performed more than 180 strikes.\n\nFour towns near the border have been targeted.\n\nTurkish and allied forces claim to have captured at least two villages in Kurdish territory.\n\nRead on for more.\n\nThe Turkish military, along with forces from the Syrian National Army, have mounted Operation Peace Spring, an incursion into territory controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nGoogle Maps / Business Insider\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been threatening an incursion into Kurdish-controlled Syrian territory for months, asking the US to help Turkey create a \"safe zone\" there for Ankara to repatriate Syrian refugees who settled in Turkey during the eight-year Syrian civil war.\n\nTurkey originally wanted to stage the invasion to create a buffer zone along its border against Kurdish forces, who control the northeastern part of Syria, as well as some land near Aleppo in the west. Turkey considers the Kurdish forces there terrorists.\n\nThe SDF was an essential partner force in the mission to destroy ISIS; on Sunday evening, Trump announced his intention to pull US forces out of northeastern Syria, which Kurds call Rojava, essentially giving a green light to a Turkish attack on the Kurds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first Turkish air strikes in northeastern Syria began Wednesday. The ground invasion began shortly thereafter.\n\nHisam el Homsi/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\nReuters, quoting Turkish media, reported that the ground incursion targeted four points in Rojava \u2014 two close to the Syrian town of Tal Abyad further west, and two near the town of Ras al-Ayn.\n\nThe Turkish Ministry of Defense said it had conducted 181 air strikes thus far and removed part of its border wall with Syria to allow ground troops in, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe Times reported that between 50 and 100 US troops pulled out of Rojava ahead of the operation. While Trump has said that the US will not be militarily assisting either side in the conflict, The Times also reported that until Monday, the US was assisting Turkey with intelligence that may have helped them target Kurds as late as Monday.", "description": "Turkey is waging a campaign against Kurdish forces in northeast Syria, leading to confusion, casualties, and rebukes from foreign governments.", "authors": ["Ellen Ioanes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nKi2zG3AStHLZvrSLbNBmQ--~B/aD0xMjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/494de5b5217bc1c83d3366ac21f7827b", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
