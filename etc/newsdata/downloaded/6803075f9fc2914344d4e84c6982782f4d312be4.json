The American people need to be reassured that the rules the FBI applies to the rest of us apply equally to its own agents and lawyers.\n\nUS ATTORNEY RECOMMENDS PROCEEDING WITH CHARGES AGAINST MCCABE, AS DOJ REJECTS LAST-DITCH APPEAL\n\nJustice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz released a report last year concluding that McCabe lied to then-FBI Director James Comey, to other FBI agents, and to officials of the Office of the Inspector General about leaks to a Wall Street Journal reporter.\n\nMcCabe made unauthorized disclosures about the FBI\u2019s investigation into the Clinton Foundation. He then lied about it when questioned, including under oath to the inspector general, Horowitz\u2019s report said.\n\nAccording to the inspector general\u2019s report, \u201claw enforcement sensitive information\u201d about the Clinton investigation was disclosed in an Oct. 20, 2016, Wall Street Journal article. Until that article was published, the FBI \u2013 as is its normal procedure \u2013 had refused to confirm whether there was an ongoing investigation.\n\nHolding McCabe to account sends a loud and clear message: no one is above the law.\n\nMcCabe disclosed a communication he had received from an Obama Justice Department official expressing his concerns over the FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation during the election, the inspector general\u2019s report found.\n\nThe IG report said that when McCabe was asked by Comey about the article, he told Comey that he had had not authorized the disclosure and didn\u2019t know who did.\n\nMcCabe repeated that lie to agents from the FBI\u2019s Inspection Division and to the Office of the Inspector General when questioned about it. Only in a second round of questioning by the inspector general did McCabe finally admit that he was responsible for the disclosure.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just that McCabe lied to investigators, including when he was under oath. The IG also says that McCabe engaged in \u201cmisconduct\u201d because the disclosure was \u201cdesigned to advance his personal interest at the expense of department leadership.\u201d\n\nBut the real point is this: lying to a federal agent is a felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001. That is the exact statute under which Special Counsel Robert Mueller \u2013 and the Justice Department \u2013 prosecuted former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn for lying to FBI agents who interviewed him about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. when Flynn was part of the Trump transition team.\n\nYou can violate this law even if you are not under oath at the time you were interviewed \u2013 and Flynn wasn\u2019t under oath when he was questioned.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThis makes McCabe\u2019s behavior arguably even worse. McCabe was under oath when he was questioned by the IG and, moreover, he held the second-highest post in the most powerful law enforcement agency in the federal government.\n\nMcCabe, more than an ordinary citizen, knew the importance of this law and the fact that he had a duty to tell the truth when he was being questioned about unauthorized leaks that could compromise an open law enforcement investigation. To believe he misremembered or temporarily forgot is not credible.\n\nHolding McCabe to account sends a loud and clear message: no one is above the law. If he wasn\u2019t prosecuted, the message would be that the laws that are applied to citizens, politicians and military officers don\u2019t apply to high-ranking FBI agents and the Justice Department.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNot only would that be legally indefensible, but providing that kind of immunity to law enforcement officials would be dangerous. They, even more than the rest of us, must be accountable for their actions and must adhere to both the spirit and the letter of the law. Anything else will inevitably lead to corruption and abuse of power.\n\nMcCabe is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. But charging him is the right thing to do.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY HANS VON SPAKOVSY", "description": "Former FBI Deputy Director and Acting Director Andrew McCabe deserves to be prosecuted on charges of lying to investigators.", "authors": ["Hans Von Spakovsky", "Hans A.
