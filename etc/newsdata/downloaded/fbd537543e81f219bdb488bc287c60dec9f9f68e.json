As a leader, you\u2019ll need to set clear expectations for your team and establish the scope and expectations for the project. However, this is often easier said than done.\n\nTo help leaders better communicate expectations and goals, we asked a panel of Young Entrepreneur Council members the following question:\n\nWhat is your preferred method for making sure your programming team is clear about the scope of a project and what needs to be done?\n\nTheir best answers are below:\n\n1. Get them involved from the start\n\n\n\nTo avoid \u201cguesswork\u201d on the scope, the programming team needs to be involved during the planning and the design phase from the start. Don\u2019t design the UI/UX without consistently walking the programming team through what is produced and receiving feedback. Not involving the programmers in this process can lead to designs that are impossible to build or under-budgeting the project. \u2013 Jinny Hyojin Oh, WANDR\n\n2. Use the scrum framework\n\nScrum is a framework for agile project management. The main concept is a daily review for the whole team. Each team member answers three questions. First, what did you work on yesterday and what is the progress? Second, what is in the way of you completing your work. Third, what you are working on today? This is a proven process that the top software companies in the world employ. \u2013 Brian Greenberg, True Blue Life Insurance\n\n3. Focus on proper documentation\n\nFifty percent of software development is specifying what needs to be coded. Having proper documentation in the form of functional specifications and software requirements is critical for clarity about what needs to be developed. Having a business analyst document the project scope before coding begins is the most effective method for ensuring scope creeps don\u2019t occur in the development phase. \u2013 Rahul Varshneya, CurveBreak\n\n4. Keep it bite-sized\n\nSmaller projects are much easier to estimate as a team, so keep things bite-sized. We work in two-week sprints, estimating user stories together before they\u2019re assigned to a sprint. Anything estimated to take more than a couple of days must be broken down into smaller items with their own requirements first. This helps avoid unknown unknowns and enforce realistic estimates. \u2013 Pete Kistler, BrandYourself\n\n5. Ask for a timeline\n\nThe best way to determine if your programming team has a grasp on a project is to ask them to develop a timeline. This tactic helps build trust and communication among your programmers, while giving you information on how well they understand the current project. \u2013 Blair Williams, MemberPress\n\n6. Use the right tools\n\n\n\nJust because we\u2019re a remote team doesn\u2019t mean there needs to be skewed communication and collaboration on projects. We use Asana to assign tasks, so everyone knows what they\u2019re responsible for. Slack is used to create channels around communicating how projects are performed. Zoom is used to video chat when chatting via Slack isn\u2019t effective enough. When you have the right tools, everything goes smoother. \u2013 Jared Atchison, WPForms\n\n7. Break it down into specific goals\n\nTo make sure your programming team is clear about the scope of a project and what needs to be done, break it down into specific goals. When you break your project up into specific goals, instead of just one big goal at the end, it will help your team understand what needs to be done in order to reach the main goal. Plus, your team will feel more accomplished every time they reach a mini-goal. \u2013 Stephanie Wells, Formidable Forms\n\n8. Create milestones\n\nWhen I want to make sure my programming team understands the scope of our project, I establish milestones that I want to see accomplished by a specific date. For example, I could tell my team that I want the software framework established in two weeks and a test build available four weeks after the foundation is complete. \u2013 Syed Balkhi, WPBeginner\n\n9. Hold weekly meetings\n\nTo make sure your programming team is clear about the scope of a project and what needs to be done, hold weekly meetings. By having weekly meetings, you can make sure everyone is on track. It also gives team members the opportunity to provide you and the others with updates and they can ask questions to clarify certain aspects of the project. \u2013 John Turner, SeedProd LLC\n\n10. Establish a communication plan\n\nI don\u2019t want to micromanage or keep an eye on my team when they\u2019re completing projects, but it\u2019s essential to make sure they stay on track and have guidance when needed. That\u2019s why creating a communication plan before starting a project is crucial. Whether you decide on creating a separate Slack channel or holding a short weekly meeting, these are things that ensure quality and efficiency. \u2013 Thomas Griffin, OptinMonster\n\n11. Provide pictures and ask for reports\n\nTwo things critical to the success of any software project are pictures and reports. Pictures of the user interface, even hand-drawn ones, communicate scope more accurately than most documents. Reports needed are a close second because it lets the team know if the pictures represent all the data necessary to create the report. Then ask the team to define how they get from pictures to reports. \u2013 Monica Snyder, Birdsong\n\n12. Meet regularly in person\n\nWe document the scope of the project and timelines for all teams and hold frequent meetings prior to and throughout development. We use Asana for project management to get everyone on the same page. Developers, designers and account managers and SEO meet in person weekly for debriefs on projects and status updates. Teams also work in-office for certain projects to avoid miscommunication. \u2013 Matthew Capala, Alphametic\n\n13. Map out the project visually\n\nCommunicate the entire process with the team in a visual way. This way, everyone can see the overall plan, specific goals and the list of tasks that need to be done. There are programs you can use for this like Asana, Slack and Hive that the entire team can jump on and update as they go. Have the team look it over before they begin and give them time to ask any questions they have. \u2013 Diego Orjuela, Cables & Sensors\n\n14. Discuss project limitations\n\nThe best way of ensuring that both you and your programming team have a full understanding of a project\u2019s scope is to have a detailed discussion about any limitations. If you have a tight deadline that can\u2019t be moved, or if your programming team won\u2019t be able to implement certain features, these points need to be acknowledged as early as possible into the project. \u2013 Bryce Welker, The Big 4 Accounting Firms\n\nThis post is part of our contributor series.
