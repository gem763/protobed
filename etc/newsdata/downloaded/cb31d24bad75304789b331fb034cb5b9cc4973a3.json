Here are some of his most infamous comments.\n\n2GB host Alan Jones has slammed Coles over its decision to pull advertising spend from his show, suggesting his listeners to shop elsewhere.\n\nOn Thursday morning, the conservative radio host took aim at the supermarket chain, which pulled advertising from his show after he last month made sexist remarks about New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern.\n\n\u201cI have been patient for a long time. But I am growing tired of some of these corporate hypocrites,\u201d Jones told listeners on 2GB and 4BC yesterday.\n\nHe criticised the supermarket chain for ripping off dairy farmers, before declaring he would \u201center the ring\u201d and hit back at them.\n\n\u201cMy advice to Coles is get your own value system in order before you start passing judgment about other people. But don\u2019t worry; we can both play the same game,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo I can tell my listeners to give Coles supermarkets, and their petrol stations a very wide berth. This is a two-way street. We can both play the same game. It might be time I entered the ring and started playing that game. And good luck to you by the time I am finished.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Alan Jones brushes off Jacinda Ardern controversy\n\nRELATED: Fresh blow for shock jock Alan Jones\n\nIn August, Coles confirmed it would no longer advertise on 2GB after Jones suggested Prime Minister Scott Morrison should \u201cshove a sock down (Ms Ardern\u2019s) throat\u201d and get tough with a \u201cfew backhanders\u201d.\n\nIn response, the supermarket chain said: \u201cColes values diversity, respect and actively promotes the rights of all of our team members and our customers. We stopped advertising on the Alan Jones program on Friday 16th August and have subsequently stopped advertising on 2GB.\u201d\n\nJones was initially unfazed, saying any advertiser which abandoned his show would quickly be replaced by another willing to take its place.\n\nBut Macquarie Media\u2019s chairman Russell Tate subsequently wrote to advertisers apologising for Jones\u2019 conduct, and offering meetings between the station, clients and Jones himself.\n\n\u201cI will close by apologising sincerely, on behalf of Macquarie and Alan, for any disruption caused to your company as a result of remarks made by him.\n\n\u201cAlan and I are happy to talk and meet with as many of our advertisers as possible over the next two months to hear your views on how we can best serve your business, but in the meantime, I would be very interested to hear any comments or thoughts which can help us do that,\u201d Mr Tate said in the letter.", "description": "2GB host Alan Jones has slammed Coles over its decision to pull advertising spend from his show, suggesting his listeners to shop elsewhere.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/5cc75afceee91a671c559c3fbdb15d93?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
