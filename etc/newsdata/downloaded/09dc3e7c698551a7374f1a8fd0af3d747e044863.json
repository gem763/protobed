In the 2018 fiscal year, Lite-On reported revenue of NT$207 billion, approximately $6.6 billion.\n\n\"Lite-On's solid state drive business is a natural and strategic fit with Toshiba Memory and expands our focus in the SSD industry,\" Nobuo Hayasaka, acting President and CEO of Toshiba Memory Holding Corporation said.\n\n\"This is an exciting acquisition for us, as it positions us to meet the projected growth in demand for SSDs in PCs and data centers being driven by the increased use of cloud services.\"\n\nIn July, Toshiba Memory announced it would rebrand as Kioxia in October.\n\nToshiba Memory was sold off to a consortium led by US private equity firm Bain Capital in June last year in a deal worth over \u00a52 trillion. Toshiba Corporation was able to retain a 40% interest in the new company.\n\nFor its first quarter results announced last month, Toshiba Memory reported a \u00a533 billion drop in sales to \u00a5214 billion yen compared to last year, with net loss widening from \u00a519 billion to \u00a595 billion.\n\nThe company said a power outage in Yokkaichi on June 15 hit its operations and had a \u00a534.4 billion impact on operating income, and it is expected to flow through to Q2. Most of its equipment was restored by mid-July.\n\nRelated Coverage", "description": "Soon to be rebranded company buys SSD segment of Taiwanese storage company.", "authors": ["Chris Duckett"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/07/22/01c16eb9-441b-4780-932c-e61d79e145fb/thumbnail/770x578/2a9612fba89b99ce8f68072c326cb530/financialcloud.jpg"}
