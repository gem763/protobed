This is about a healthy lifestyle. We want the legends to know about financial management and how to save money. We are finalising other deals with some insurance companies whereby, once a member is gone, his family will get R20 000 and a headstone erected on the same day,\u201d said Makhubu.\n\nHe said some former football players have raised their hands and wanted to be counted because they were not \u201cold, but just grown-ups\u201d.\n\nForgotten yesteryear players have decided to take the bull by the horns by being at the forefront of reviving football in schools.\n\nThey decried their lack of involvement and claimed to have been sidelined by Safa.\n\n\u201cPeople are perceived as liabilities instead of assets,\u201d said former Kaizer Chiefs player Lamola.\n\nHe said former players had a big role to play in the development of South African football, particularly at school level.\n\n\u201cSafa thinks [only] the 1996 crop of players [who won Afcon] should get recognition, but football started long before 1996. Before then, there were people who swelled the ground and they must all be recognised.\u201d\n\nThey said the situation that legends found themselves in was dire as most of them were no longer employable because of their age and [lack of other] skills, but they had families to feed.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that we are not being given the respect that we deserve Vusi \u201cMaria Maria\u201d Lamola\n\n\u201cWe feel we have a role to play in terms of ploughing back [our knowledge] at schools. Today\u2019s youngsters need role models and we are there to offer our services and life skills. We feel like we have been buried alive by the system as we are not being utilised by the powers that be,\u201d said Lamola.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that we are not being given the respect that we deserve. We have been knocking on different doors, but the response has been very poor.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we are not part of development structures means they can\u2019t utilise our expertise. We want to be part of the change that is happening in the country and we have the capacity and human capital to do so,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEven though we are being sidelined, we feel we must do something.\n\n\u201cWe want to deal with school violence. Schools used to be safe environments, but when you isolate certain people, these are the results. Our members are fathers and mothers in communities, and can help stop violence and bullying at schools.\u201d\n\nAt the top of their priority list, the legends said, was to revive Wednesday sports days at schools.\n\n\u201cMost of us started there and we were discovered there. Soweto used to produce gold. If you want gold, you have to dig deeper, but, in Soweto, gold was on the pavements and there was no need to dig deeper. But that is not the case any more. We need to go back to basics because talent is there,\u201d said Makhubu.\n\nThe biggest problem is that we are fragmented and talking in different voices Charles Makhubu\n\nHowever, the legends\u2019 biggest challenge is lack of unity.\n\n\u201cThe biggest problem is that we are fragmented and talking in different voices. We must first integrate everyone from different eras. We want an association that caters for everyone, not just a few individuals,\u201d Makhubu said.\n\nThe legends said they were upset that the talent identification programme was non-existent. Lamola said the fact that most players only matured at 27 or older was a true reflection of how bad things were: \u201cThe likes of Fetsi Molatedi played as a professional at 17 or so, so why can\u2019t we do it again? With so many resources in the country, is it not possible to improve our programmes and fast-track some of these talented youngsters?\u201d he asked.\n\nA process of uniting the legends has started, with former players being brought together \u201cin one room\u201d to iron out their differences.", "description": "Just when you thought they were dead and buried, some of local football\u2019s masters and legends are on the verge of establishing a stokvel of a different kind.", "authors": ["Timothy Molobi"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9315/db468dbe5ed24d62a5c406531d21d2cc.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
