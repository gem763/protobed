Mr. Trump has also appointed 43 circuit court nominees and two Supreme Court justices since taking office.\n\nThe pace has far outdone President Obama, who only saw 20 circuit court nominees and 74 district court judges confirmed during the same period of time. Mr. Obama, though, like Mr. Trump had two Supreme Court appointments within his first three years.\n\nLiberal advocacy groups said the 150th judicial confirmation is alarming, stressing the need to make judicial nominees and the courts a 2020 campaign issue.\n\n\u201cAs of today\u2019s confirmation votes, Trump and McConnell have confirmed 150 judges to the federal bench \u2014 a group that can overwhelmingly be described as narrow-minded and elitist, favoring corporations and the powerful over the interests of all Americans,\u201d said Marge Baker, executive vice president of the People for the American Way.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
