While that was above Wall Street expectations it still raised concerns about investment and growth ahead as the stimulus from tax cuts disappears.\n\nrose by 5.7 million barrels for the week ended Oct. 25, the Energy Information Administration said. The market was looking for a rise of about 494,000 barrels, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.\n\n\u201cIt appears that we\u2019re finally getting back to what appears like normalization of fall season trends,\u201d Investing.com analyst Barani Krishnan said. \u201cImports have risen by more than 800,000 barrels and that has contributed to the larger-than-expected build.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe refinery run rate has picked up for a second-straight week too, though it remains below 90%,\u201d Krishnan added.\n\nfell by about 3 million barrels, versus forecasts for drawdown of about 2.19 million barrels, while declined by 1 million barrels, compared with expectations for a drop of 2.35 million.\n\n\u201cRefineries are probably running more distillates now because you\u2019re already seeing the epic declines in distillates coming off,\u201d Krishnan said. \u201cBut gasoline draws remain a little unusually strong for this time of year.\u201d\n\nU.S. production remained at a record 12.6 million barrels per day for the fourth-straight week, the EIA reported.\n\n\u201cThis must irk some oil bulls who will argue how\u2019s that possible with the way the oil rig count is collapsing,\u201d Krishan said.", "description": "Oil Prices Under Pressure After Big Crude Stockpile Gain", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/999e9d554a53b39c7e910f2945582ab5_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
