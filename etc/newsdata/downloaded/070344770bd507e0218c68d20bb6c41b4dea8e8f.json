Adam Schiff, D-Calif., but a Republican challenging him for his House seat doesn't think the call, in which Schiff expressed eagerness to get \"compromising material\" on President Trump, is a laughing matter.\n\nJon Hollis, who is running for the Los Angeles-area seat held by Schiff since 2001, has filed an ethics complaint against his opponent based on the 2017 call, in which a phony Ukrainian politician claimed to have graphic photos of the then newly-inaugurated President Trump.\n\nGOP LAWMAKER DIGS UP AUDIO OF SCHIFF TELLING PRANK CALLERS HE WOULD ACCEPT TRUMP DIRT FROM UKRAINE\n\n\u201cThis letter serves as an official complaint to the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) regarding Rep. Adam Schiff\u2019s illegal collusion with foreign entities and misuse of taxpayer resources for opposition research on political enemies,\u201d one complaint, dated Aug. 28 and filed by Jon Hollis, a Republican challenger for the seat in California\u2019s 28th Congressional District, stated. \u201cThe evidence supporting Adam\u2019s Schiff's violations of the law is compelling and irrefutable.\u201d\n\nThe filing primarily points to that wincing 2017 call that continues to haunt.\n\nAt the time, Schiff assumed he was talking with Ukrainian politician Andriy Parubiy, who solicited potentially damaging information and compromising pictures of Trump from his visit to Russia for the Miss Universe pageant four years earlier.\n\nSchiff stressed in the call that he would \u201cbe in touch with the FBI\u201d to make arrangements with regard to accessing the supposedly explicit materials and cautioned the voice on the other end not to divulge anything he would not want \u201cour Russian friends\u201d to hear, warning that they were likely listening.\n\nHowever, in reality, the then-ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee was conversing with someone far from the political powers of Kiev. Instead, he was being pranked by two Russian comedians \u2014 Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexey Stolyarov. Schiff became chairman of the committee this year.\n\nRUSSIAN RADIO HOSTS PRANK LINDSEY GRAHAM INTO THINKING HE'S ON PHONE WITH TURKEY'S DEFENSE MINISTER\n\n\u201cIt is clear from the recorded phone call that Rep. Schiff knows he should not be trying to obtain opposition research on a political opponent from foreign nationals. He attempts to mask his wrongdoing by, on numerous occasions, mentioning that he will work with the FBI,\u201d Hollis asserted in the letter. \u201cIn so doing, Rep. Schiff is attempting to involve the FBI in his corrupt attempt to obtain dirt on President Trump. The FBI should not be in the business of teaming up with politicians to use the power of government to dig up dirt on political opponents.\u201d\n\nLast week, the conservative nonprofit Tea Party Patriots Action group also filed an ethics complaint with regard to the controversial \u201cUkrainian\u201d call, \u201crequesting an inquiry into multiple violations of House ethics rules by Schiff,\u201d also alleging that he had \u201cused and abused his position\u201d in the endeavor to \u201cseek damaging and negative information about President Trump.\u201d\n\nA representative for Schiff did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but a spokesperson for the congressman previously told the Atlantic that the committee \u201cinformed appropriate law-enforcement and security personnel of the conversation, and (the) belief it was probably bogus.\u201d\n\nADAM SCHIFF'S 2020 REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER VOWS TO PROPEL 'THE VIPER INTO RETIREMENT'\n\nHollis is alleging Schiff's role in the call was a blatant \u201cabuse of power\u201d and remains a hallmark talking point as he attempts to unseat the long-standing democratic figure in the 2020 election. Throughout much of Trump\u2019s first term in office, Schiff \u2013 who has served in Congress as a member of the Democratic Party since 2001 \u2013 was a primary pursuant of the Robert Mueller-led probe into whether the Trump campaign \u201ccolluded\u201d with Russia to secure 2016 election victory.\n\n\u201cWatching Schiff push a false narrative over and over again with Russia and now with the whistleblower complaint tells us the only thing he cares about it fake investigations,\u201d Hollis told Fox News. \u201cMeanwhile, we have 60,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County, and his district is falling apart.\u201d\n\nHollis, a 29-year-old political rookie who grew up in the central Californian city of Fresno, is also pledging to fix his ailing homestead, which he accuses Schiff of neglecting.\n\n\u201cThe district historically has a 40 percent turnout, so we need to get the young people to vote. For me, the rampant homelessness is the No. 1 issue followed by mental health reform,\u201d Hollis continued. \u201cMental Health is the root cause of many issues we are facing today. And our infrastructure is falling apart \u2013 our roads, schools, energy and water systems.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, he emphasized, Californians are paying one of the highest tax rates in the nation, with 32 new taxes slapped on residents in 2019 alone.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHollis, who has spent a decade working in the film industry as an assistant director and now a location scout for major studios, is one of five challengers so far striving to defeat Schiff from the 28th district, which spans pockets of central Los Angeles and West Hollywood to the eastern fringes of Burbank and Glendale. He is one of a multitude of conservative critics accusing Schiff of \u201cwasting millions of dollars and countless hours pushing lies\u201d in a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against the President.\n\n\u201cMr. Schiff is out there with his dog and pony show,\u201d Hollis added. \u201cBut if our district isn\u2019t helped, we won\u2019t get back from the brink.\u201d", "description": "A prank call by Russian deejays fished California Democrat Adam Schiff in, but\u00a0a Republican challenging him for his House seat doesn't think the call, in which Schiff expressed eagerness to get \"compromising material\" on President Trump, is a laughing matter.", "authors": ["Hollie Mckay", "Hollie Mckay Has A Been A Fox News Digital Staff Reporter Since She Has Extensively Reported War Zones Including Iraq", "Syria", "Yemen", "Afghanistan", "Pakistan", "Burma", "Latin America Investigates Global Conflicts", "War Crimes", "Terrorism Around The World.
