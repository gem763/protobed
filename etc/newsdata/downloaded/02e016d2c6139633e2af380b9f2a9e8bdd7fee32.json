The premium earbuds are set for release on October 30th for $249. They\u2019re up for preorder starting today. And yes, they still only come in white.\n\nApple has built microphones into the AirPods Pro that detect external sound, and the earbuds then cancel it out. The system used here sounds very similar to the noise cancellation in the new Beats Solo Pro headphones, just miniaturized to a much smaller form factor. Apple says noise cancellation is adjusted up to 200 times per second.\n\nThe AirPods Pro feature a transparency mode that will let you hear your surroundings while wearing them. The earbuds have a \u201cforce sensor\u201d that you can use to control music playback and activate transparency mode.\n\nThe company is promising fantastic audio quality from the AirPods Pro for that $249 price. They have a feature called \u201cAdaptive EQ\u201d that \u201cautomatically tunes music to the shape of your ear.\u201d\n\nUnlike the current AirPods, these will come with flexible ear tips for a more secure, sealed in-ear fit. Three sizes of silicone tips are included in the box. Apple even says there\u2019s a software audio test that can tell you if you\u2019ve chosen the right-sized tip by \u201cmeasuring the sound level in the ear and comparing it to what is coming from the speaker driver.\u201d This should reduce any guesswork or confusion for customers.\n\nLike the second-gen AirPods, the AirPods Pro support wireless charging and hands-free \u201cHey Siri\u201d voice commands. Apple says they get around 4.5 hours of continuous listening battery life. (You can see that the active noise cancellation takes a bit of a toll there.) But as usual with AirPods, the case has enough extra battery for around 24 hours of total listening time, including those recharges.\n\nThe AirPods Pro are sweat and water resistant \u2014 get ready to start seeing these in gyms everywhere \u2014 and they include \u201can expanded mesh microphone port that improves call clarity in windy situations.\u201d\n\nThey still charge via the Lightning connector, but they now come with a Lightning to USB-C cable in the box.\n\nApple\u2019s new AirPods come just as noise cancellation \u2014 long a convenience offered by over-ear headphones from Bose, Sony, and others \u2014 has begun making its way to truly wireless earbuds. Sony\u2019s noise-canceling 1000X M3 earbuds cost $229. And Amazon\u2019s Echo Buds, with Bose noise reduction (not full-on cancellation) technology, are about to hit shelves for $129.99. AirPods have seen a meteoric rise in popularity since they were first released, so it\u2019s safe to assume that Apple is about to have another smash hit on its hands.", "description": "Apple\u2019s new AirPods Pro with active noise cancellation are coming on October 30th for $249.
