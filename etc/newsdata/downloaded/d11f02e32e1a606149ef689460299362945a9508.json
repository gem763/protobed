That is consistent with what we've seen here,\" he said.\n\nHe said although such swaps were common during the Cold War, \"this is very exceptional in terms of Australia's practices.\"\n\nForeign Minister Marise Payne said her government continued to seek the return of a third Australian, Melbourne University lecturer Kylie Moore-Gilbert, who has been in detention since October 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPayne described her situation as \"very complex\", adding that the government did not accept the spying charges against her.\n\nRothwell believed Australia would have tried to negotiate a \"three-for-one outcome\" with Iran. \"The fact that is has taken some time to finalise this matter subsequent to the prime minister's visit to the United States suggests there was some significant behind-the-scenes diplomacy to try to get the three Australians released but ultimately that has not proven possible,\" he said.\n\nProfessor Amin Saikal, a Middle East expert at ANU, said Australia's relationship with Iran provided some optimism over Moore-Gilbert's potential release.\n\n\"Australia has had a good working relationship with Iran despite there being hostilities between the United States and Iran,\" he said. \"The [Moore-Gilbert] case is more complex [than the bloggers] but with negotiations still going on that generates a bit of hope.\"\n\nAP\n\nAAP", "description": "The Attorney General on Sunday refused to comment on whether a prisoner swap was behind the release of two Australians from Iran in exchange for an Iranian student who was facing extradition to the US.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_21%2C$y_70/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/98f8468a5fc7667d96bc5f8296990b6ef7c0a20f", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
