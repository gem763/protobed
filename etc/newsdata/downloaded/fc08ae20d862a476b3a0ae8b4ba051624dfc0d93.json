It\u2019s like how long until this guy changes his name to Kathy?\u201d\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nHe added: \u201cNow you might think I\u2019m crazy, but about five years ago, there was a fella named Bruce Jenner, and he moved to Calabasas\u2026\u201d\n\nThe attempt at humour immediately fell flat with the audience, many of whom groaned loudly and audibly said \u201cnoooo\u201d.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nTaking to Twitter , one outraged viewer wrote: \u201cMichael Che just deadnamed and misgendered Caitlyn Jenner on air for a joke. The joke? Implying Kanye West is trans. F**kin hell mate.\u201d\n\nAnother tweeted the show directly, saying: \u201cTransphobia isn\u2019t funny\u201d.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
