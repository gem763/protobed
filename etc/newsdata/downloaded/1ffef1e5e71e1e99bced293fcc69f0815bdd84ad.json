To some, that\u2019s a huge problem.\n\nFacebook, Twitter and other social media platforms have decided to allow politicians including President Donald Trump extra leeway to their rules, seeking to avoid stifling political debate and leaving \u201cnewsworthy\u201d content online.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s efforts to push falsehoods and conspiracy theories have prompted calls for platforms to rethink those guidelines to prevent the president and others from spreading false and misleading information.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden recently asked Facebook to take down \u201cdebunked\u201d claims in a Trump ad on the leading social network, only to be rebuffed.\n\nIn a response to Biden, Facebook said statements by politicians, even if false, are \u201cconsidered direct speech and ineligible for our third-party fact checking program.\u201d\n\nSenator and presidential candidate Kamala Harris meanwhile called on Twitter to ban Trump after the president violated the platform\u2019s rules by accusing his critics of \u201ctreason\u201d and warning that an attempt to impeach him amounted to a \u201ccoup.\u201d\n\nThe candidates\u2019 demands are typical of the conundrum social media firms face as they seek to remain open for public debate while curbing \u201chate speech,\u201d abusive conduct and patently false claims from politicians.\n\nFacebook and Twitter have both steered away from removing \u201cnewsworthy\u201d content which may include false or misleading comments from political leaders. YouTube offers a similar exemption.\n\nThis policy \u201cseems like a troubling compromise because it\u2019s an invitation to political actors to say whatever they think is expedient whether it\u2019s true or not,\u201d said Paul Barrett, deputy director of the Stern Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University and author of a report on \u201cDisinformation and the 2020 Election.\u201d\n\nBarrett\u2019s report recommends that social networks take down \u201cprovably false\u201d information, though he acknowledged that would leave big loopholes for politicians stretching the truth.\n\nThe report noted that a majority of deliberately deceptive or false information shared on social media comes not from Russia or other foreign sources but from within the United States, making it more complicated to take down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real conundrum. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a an easy answer,\u201d Barrett said.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Vector for misinformation\u2019 \u2013\n\nFacebook vice president Nick Clegg said last month the social network would treat speech from politicians \u201cas newsworthy content that should, as a general rule, be seen and heard.\u201d\n\nGaurav Laroia of the watchdog group Free Press said exceptions allowed by Facebook means the company \u201cis allowing its platform to be a vector for misinformation in the lead-up to the 2020 election.\u201d\n\nFacebook\u2019s ad policies leave a gaping loophole for Trump, the biggest political ad spender on the platform, as he faces a congressional impeachment inquiry, according to Free Press.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, another presidential candidate, accused Facebook of buckling to pressure from the White House on political misinformation.\n\n\u201cTrump and (Facebook CEO Mark) Zuckerberg met at the White House two weeks ago. What did they talk about?\u201d Warren tweeted.\n\n\u201cFacebook is now okay with running political ads with known lies.\u201d\n\nFacebook maintains it has not changed its stand but clarified a policy of steering clear of the touchy subject of moderating political speech.\n\n\u201cOur approach is grounded in Facebook\u2019s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is,\u201d Facebook public policy director Katie Harbath said.\n\n\u2013 \u2018They need standards\u2019 \u2013\n\nMichelle Amazeen, a Boston University professor specializing in political communication, said platforms have an economic interest in attracting political ads and have been \u201copaque\u201d about misinformation policies.\n\nShe said social networks are capable of rejecting ads from Trump that have debunked information.\n\n\u201cThey need to have some standards,\u201d Amazeen said.\n\nSome messages, she said, are not just misleading but may incite violence or otherwise put lives in danger.\n\n\u201cIf fact checkers have shown that a political ad is inaccurate, it should not be allowed to circulate,\u201d she said.\n\nSamuel Woolley, a University of Texas professor who has researched manipulation in the 2016 election campaign, agreed that social networks need to step up against misinformation, whatever the source.\n\n\u201cFalse information coming from a political leader is much more potent than if it were coming from a bot or fake account,\u201d Woolley said.\n\nWhether social networks have the capacity to rapidly detect and remove false information is an open question, but Woolley said it is their responsibility.\n\n\u201cSocial media companies created this problem, they made clear decisions to scale at this rate, so I feel it\u2019s up to them to use their massive resources to address this problem through technology and human labor,\u201d he said.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 As social media firms ramp up their fight against misinformation, politicians have been largely left exempt.
