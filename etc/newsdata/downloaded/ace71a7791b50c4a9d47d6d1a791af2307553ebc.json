Regardless of the amount of drugs in possession, police standards state that all employees \u201cmust comply with the law whether on or off duty.\u201d\n\nThe unnamed officer was immediately suspended from duty while an investigation by the Professional Standards Unit takes place.\n\n\u201cIn the event that you are charged with a criminal offence you are required to report the matter to your commander,\u201d the standards say. \u201cSerious misconduct can lead to transfer, loss of income or removal from NSW Police.\u201d\n\nHe will appear in Downing Centre Local Court on drug possession charges on October 23. It is unclear whether he will remain in the police force.\n\nAhhh, the sweet, sweet taste of irony. *sips tea*", "description": "", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-08-at-9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
