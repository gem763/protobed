Whoever their Pollster is, they suck.\u201d\n\nAnd yet despite Trump\u2019s insistence that his phone call with the Ukrainian president was \u201cperfect,\u201d that Fox News poll shows that the \u201cvast majority of registered voters definitely do not think it was perfect,\u201d Meyers said, digging in below the top-line numbers.\n\n\u201cIf Trump can\u2019t rely on Fox News to make himself feel better, what can he watch?\u201d the host asked. \u201cHis aides are going to have to replace his TV with a mirror and hope he doesn\u2019t notice.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo now that Trump is freaking out about the growing support for impeachment in the polls, he\u2019s throwing as many people as he can under the bus,\u201d Meyers added, noting that he\u2019s tried to \u201cpin the blame\u201d for the Ukraine call on his outgoing Energy Secretary Rick Perry and relied in large part on Rudy Giuliani, \u201cwho are famously two of the dumbest people in politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like if Lex Luthor hatched a plan to kill Superman and chose as his assassins Mr. Bean and Woody from Cheers,\u201d Meyers joked.", "description": "\u201cIf Trump can\u2019t rely on Fox News to make himself feel better, what can he watch?\u201d the \u201cLate Night\u201d host asked.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1433,w_2547,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570758866/SM_51_pbbuty", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
