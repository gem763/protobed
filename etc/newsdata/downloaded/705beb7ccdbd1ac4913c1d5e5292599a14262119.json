Scary and epic at the same time; ill never forget it.\n\nThat's serendipity. Bonus points for the iPod.\n\nA lovely family moment\n\nI loved watching repeats of the 60s Batman TV show as a kid. Joker on the show had a moustache and looked just like my great grandad, and I used to wear my bat suit with cereal box mask and tea towel cape and chase \"The Joker\" around his retirement community. He's long gone now but they are great memories.\n\nBeautiful memory, mate.\n\nSomeone who learnt a lot from the best\n\nMy aunt buying me a Batman shirt, I wore it all the time and he became my favourite super hero because in the end, anyone could be him if they wanted it bad enough. A super hero without super powers, just determination (the money helps a bit though). Comics taught me right from wrong and made me who I am today.\n\nAunts are the absolute best. And I think people are really in the last 10 years \u2014 especially non-comics fans \u2014 starting to wake up to how much nuance there has been in comics all along.\n\nTruly remarkable.\n\nSomeone who got closer to her nephew through the Bat\n\nBatman brought me closer to my nephew. I always longed to be close to him and because of Batman I've been able to form a healthy and strong relationship and bond with my 7yr old nephew. I'm so grateful to the creators of Batman for this. So my best moment is life changing as I've never had a close family member until now. We have many favourite moments in Batman movies. When he first calls himself Batman is my Favourite ????\n\nNever underestimate the power of comics.\n\nBut the winner of the limited edition Detective Comics #1000 is...\n\nImage: Jim Lee, Scott Williams, Alex Sinclair, DC Comics\n\nSomeone who has a Batman of her own\n\nMy own BATMAN came into my life he was born 3 months early and 519 grams, 10% chance of survival and on every machine one could think of. Like Batman he is my Symbol of hope through despair, Brave, Fearless.\n\nCongratulations to the winner (who I've contacted via email), and thanks to everyone who entered.
