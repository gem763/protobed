But I have to see, do I like it, and can I be efficient.'\n\nThe 69-year-old went on to explain that the role would include informing players about potential options once they retire.\n\nHe said: 'Dealing with coaching efficiency. Dealing with after-career potential for players, to educate them to potential jobs for them after the career of a football player.\n\n'Because you forget the drama of a player is to get to the top of the world and at 34 years where a young man is bye bye over.\n\n'I think there is enough to do there to help the players come back and help to develop football.\n\n'As well to continue to improve the rules of the game. We can still move forward on that front. And always to be ahead of the evolution of society.
