Giuliani. For 25 years, I carried a wallet-size photo of the three of us from that day.\n\nLiz and I met working on Mr. Giuliani\u2019s 1993 mayoral campaign. She was the campaign\u2019s deputy finance director and I was the spokesman. Our small paid staff and hundreds of volunteers worked tirelessly to elect Rudy after he had narrowly lost to incumbent Mayor David Dinkins in 1989.\n\nRudy told The New Yorker in January that he doesn\u2019t think about his legacy, but is afraid that \u201cRudy Giuliani: He lied for Trump\u201d will be on his gravestone. \u201cSomehow, I don\u2019t think that will be it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, if it is, so what do I care? I\u2019ll be dead.\u201d\n\nHe may not care, but anyone who worked on his winning campaigns in 1993 and 1997 or in City Hall during his two terms as mayor does care about his legacy \u2014 and theirs. We were proud to live and work in the clean, safe, prosperous city that Rudy ran and that Mayor Michael Bloomberg inherited from him.", "description": "The man I worked for in 1993 is not the man who now lies for Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Ken Frydman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/07/opinion/07Frydman01/07Frydman01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
