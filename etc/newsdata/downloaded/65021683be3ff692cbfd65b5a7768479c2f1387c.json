Figuring out in which direction all those prices will move. Traders will have their work cut out for them when assessing the impact of this new effort to dethrone an unpredictable leader who has influenced markets like no other U.S. president before him -- and who already has survived several mortal threats to his presidency. Despite a newly-released memo recounting a phone call in which President Donald Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden, what lies ahead in politics -- and markets -- is far from certain.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t trade this stuff right now, it\u2019s impossible,\u201d Michael Purves, chief executive officer at Tallbacken Capital Advisors LLC, told Bloomberg TV. \u201cThere\u2019s so many different scenarios. Does this support Biden? Does it hurt Biden? Does this support (Elizabeth) Warren? Ultimately if her momentum keeps building, what happens to Trump? If impeachment goes through, is it ever going to become a reality with the Senate being Republican-controlled? There\u2019s so many different scenarios, you almost have to just ignore it and keep just investing the way you would.\u201d\n\nWhile this may be sound advice, ignoring this soap opera is not an option for many on Wall Street, especially as the crucial fourth quarter approaches. Investors and analysts have been busy cranking out trade ideas to profit from the latest and most dramatic act in the drama that has been Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nStill About Trade\n\nPerhaps the biggest question is how the impeachment drive will affect Trump\u2019s trade war with China. Stocks and bond yields reached their highs of the day on Wednesday after Trump said a trade deal could happen sooner than people think. On Tuesday, Trump\u2019s stern words toward China in a speech at the United Nations and reports that Pelosi was considering impeachment triggered a sell-off in stocks and gains in bonds.\n\n\u201cThe reaction yesterday was investors putting themselves in the shoes of Chinese negotiators and saying \u2018If I\u2019m sitting across the table and I\u2019m one of the Chinese negotiators, my position, relatively speaking, just got a lot stronger,\u2019\u201d said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade.\n\nThere is little consensus on how the political ramifications play out, especially when it comes to the trade war. Still, many analysts and investors agree on a few things. For one, while the House of Representatives could vote to impeach Trump, the Republican-led Senate is unlikely to remove him from office since it would take 67 votes -- including at least 20 of the Republican senators -- to do so. In the meantime, other initiatives in Washington -- say, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact or proposals to reduce prescription drug prices -- could get stalled until it all plays out. If Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment is any guide, this could be a months-long process.\n\nAt RBC Capital Markets, analyst Brian Abrahams wrote that an overhaul of drug prices is unlikely now, and that may give a boost to biotechnology companies that have largely sat out this year\u2019s rally in stocks.\n\n\u201cLegislating is dead,\u201d Raymond James policy analyst Ed Mills wrote in a note.\n\n\u201cDownright Scary\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, at Wells Fargo Securities, interest-rate strategists Mike Schumacher and Zachary Griffiths see the process keeping a lid on Treasury yields as investors digest elevated political risk. They say the \u201canimus in Washington could prove downright scary\u201d because Congress will be unlikely to agree on a spending bill to boost the economy if a downturn emerges in the next six to 12 months. But sentiment could just as well flip, sending yields higher, if the House impeaches Trump and he\u2019s then acquitted, they added.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened in Clinton\u2019s case, with the House voting in October 1998 to initiate an inquiry into allegations that stemmed from a sexual harassment lawsuit. The Senate then acquitted Clinton of two charges on Feb. 12, 1999, after falling well short of a two-thirds majority. Stocks rallied through most of that period.\n\nStill, events like this are rare and past market action cannot be relied upon as a playbook because of the unique context that accompanied each, according to John Normand, JPMorgan\u2019s head of cross-asset fundamental strategy. Equity and credit markets entered the Clinton impeachment drama while recovering from the Asian financial crisis, Russia\u2019s default and the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, Normand wrote in a note to clients. Meanwhile, dot-com stocks were booming.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- With a statement lasting only a few minutes, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unleashed an impeachment inquiry that has the potential to move the price of everything from soybeans to stocks, bonds and the U.S. dollar.The only problem?
