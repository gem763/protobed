The woman told social media users that she had never dyed her hair because she considered her greys a part of her identity\n\nAnother member of the grombre community said that almost a year had passed since she started her grey journey and she was beginning to like her hair more and more. She went on to say that some have even complimented her for finding 'such a good dye'\n\nAnother person said that it had been more than a year since she had last dyed her hair and that she couldn't be happier. On Instagram she wrote: 'I love my hair. I have watched in fascination as the silver slowly weaves through the dark'\n\nRachel Miller (pictured) said that she considered her grey hair a privilege and that 'far too many people pass away before they see any'. She told social media users that she had never dyed her hair and liked the ever growing strands of silver to her crown\n\nMildred, from Italy, spent eight months growing out her grey hair and wrote: 'For those who see me wrong. I have been mocking a system that I don't know who invented it'\n\nAnother social media user said that she had been dying her hair for 15 years until taking a year off to travel around the world. She wrote: 'The feedback of my grey stripes was so positive that it encouraged me to stay grey and now at 34 years it is my trademark'\n\nAnother woman said that she started to notice her shiny silver hairs continue to come through after her henna application. After five years of continuous application she decided to cut her hair and celebrate her new grey colour\n\nIris Lalinha, from Brazil (pictured), described how she would often pluck her grey hairs out after first noticing them at the age of 21. She has now started to grow the silver strands out and feels 'super special and beautiful'\n\nJenne\u00e1 (pictured) said that after her hair began to grow back white following Alopecia she let the negative comments get to her and dyed her hair to dark brown. She regretted her decision and is now committed to seeing her natural hair colour shine through", "description": "The global movement Grombre has now seen women of all ages, from all over the world, embrace their ever- growing silver locks and celebrate the natural phenomenon of grey hair.", "authors": ["Bhvishya Patel For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/16/19212584-0-image-a-62_1570030165710.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
