They have been nullified, restricted far too easily by most opposition, and that was again the case against West Ham.\n\nIn truth, the Hammers\u2019 back four were largely untroubled, certainly in a tepid, lacklustre first half. There is a lack of creativity, an absence of any ideas in the final third, and that will be a real concern for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who allowed Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez to leave the club in the summer.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Dan James did his best to offer a directness. He was expertly marked out of the game, though. And Marcus Rashford was equally ineffective.\n\nSolskjaer must find a way to bring his attacking players into the game. United\u2019s build-up play was slow and one-dimensional, allowing West Ham to defend in numbers and snuff out any potential openings.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Given time and space, he is often ruthless, capable of producing moments of brilliance. And that is what he did against Manchester United in the first half, receiving the ball from Mark Noble and arrowing a superb finish into the bottom corner.\n\nBut Yarmolenko has not always provided when needed since his arrival last year. He has often struggled for consistency, and has been plagued by injuries. And that has meant a reduced output, an inability to perform with any regularity.\n\nThe signs this season, though, are promising. Yarmolenko opened his account for the campaign against Norwich and has already added another to his account, matching his total for last season. And he looks in confident mood, gliding past players on the right and shooting with that lethal left foot.\n\nIf he continues in a similar vein, Yarmolenko could be a big player for the Hammers this season.\n\n3) Juan Mata ineffectual in midfield\n\nThe logic behind Juan Mata\u2019s inclusion in this team was obvious. Solskjaer wanted someone to sit in the pocket, to play incisive passes in behind West Ham\u2019s defence. The Spaniard is certainly capable of that, but it was not what he did on Sunday afternoon.\n\nFor most of the first half, he was anonymous, appearing only to knock the ball sideways and maintain possession. He attempted to play with more purpose after the break but his usual quality was lacking. With Paul Pogba absent and Nemanja Matic and Scott McTominay making up the remainder of the midfield, the onus was on Mata to create. But he was kept far too quiet by a disciplined, stubborn West Ham side.\n\nUnited may have to look elsewhere as they search for a solution to their offensive troubles.\n\n4) West Ham quietly establishing themselves as a top six contender\n\nManuel Pellegrini\u2019s side have gone under the radar a little so far this season. Six games in, the Hammers sit nicely in fourth place, level on points with Leicester. They have been beaten just once, that hammering on the opening day of the season at the hands of Manchester City.\n\nAnd Sunday\u2019s victory over Manchester United means West Ham have now accrued three wins from their last four games, an impressive run of form that should not go unnoticed.\n\nIt is early in the season, of course, and much can change, but West Ham look on course for a productive season. And given the inconsistency of some of those expected to challenge for a place in the top six this campaign, there is no reason not to be ambitious.\n\n5) Rashford struggling to find form\n\nMarcus Rashford began the season excellently. He scored twice in an emphatic victory over Chelsea, and the expectation then was that this would be his year, that he would be the focal point, the driving force in attack for this new-look United team.\n\nThat has not materialised as yet, though. And against West Ham, Rashford cut a frustrated figure. He appears to be lacking in confidence, both in himself and his teammates, who admittedly did little to help him out. His forward runs were repeatedly ignored and by the time he was forced to withdraw with an injury, Rashford looked despondent.\n\nHe will hope things turn around quickly.", "description": "1) United toothless in attack Since their 4-0 thrashing of Chelsea on the opening day of the season, United have managed just four goals in five games.
