The doctor has demonstrated the workings of a menstrual cup, lip-synced a segment called, \u201cIs Grey\u2019s Anatomy actually what residency is like???\u201d (Nope and yup, she concludes), and shared the ironies of giving a rectal exam.\n\nBut Leslie\u2019s videos on vaping \u2014 the rampant use of e-cigarettes that\u2019s been associated with 1,479 lung injury cases and 33 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control \u2014 have scored big. In a recent video called, \u201cExplaining a lung X-ray of a person with the new vaping disease\u201d Leslie shared X-ray images of a \u201cnormal\u201d set of lungs and one affected by EVALI (e-cigarettes or vaping product use associated lung injury), the mystery condition named by the Centers for Disease Control.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty gnarly chest X-ray,\u201d says Leslie in the video, \u201cand I would not want to have that disease. If you\u2019re thinking about quitting, now is the time to do it.\u201d That video got 627K likes, 6.8K comments.\n\nA Minnesota doctor named Dr. Rose Marie Leslie uses the social media platform TikTok to reach her young patients. (Screenshot: TikTok/drleslie) More\n\nAnother video is captioned, \u201cScared of the new vaping disease????? Here\u2019s what to avoid. Any TCH or CBD products (legal or homemade)...any black market or counterfeit e-cig products!...or just stop smoking anything!!!\u201d The Centers for Disease Control has stated that THC was associated with most of the EVALI cases.\n\nLeslie tells Yahoo Lifestyle that she joined TikTok because it seemed like a fun and unique platform to post videos. \u201cNot many of my friends were on it at the time,\u201d she says. \u201cI started naturally incorporating medical tips into my videos and that\u2019s when things took off.\u201d\n\nVaping got on Leslie\u2019s radar because her patients reported indulging. \u201cThe data we have shows that many users, especially teens, are vaping having never smoked cigarettes before,\u201d she tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cThey\u2019re curious, enjoy the flavored options, and perceive it as less harmful than cigarettes.\u201d\n\nLeslie says that some patients and even close friends have quit vaping because of her videos, although she cannot provide direct medical advice over social media. \u201cWhen someone messages me asking for personalized care, I refer them to their own provider,\u201d she says.\n\nShe generally posts one video per day, depending on her schedule. \u201cSome videos take 30 minutes of preparation, others five minutes,\u201d says Leslie. \u201cRight now at the clinic, we\u2019re looking at the link between loneliness and heath, so I have all these ideas for the next video.\u201d When Leslie is not practicing medicine, she\u2019s hanging out with her live-in boyfriend of five years and taking care of their dog Mac, a border collie-corgi mix.\n\nMuch has been said about Leslie\u2019s age (she\u2019s in her second year of residency), but in her view, youth is a perk. \u201cYounger doctors can relate to hearing comments about our appearance or having patients seek a second opinion because of it, but my age puts me in a unique position to understand the needs and interests of millennials and Gen Z,\u201d she tells Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nAt this minute, that\u2019s vaping and the associated quick-developing symptoms. \u201cThe body has an acute and immediate reaction to vaping, unlike other conditions that develop years and years later,\u201d says Leslie. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the long-term effects of vaping and that puts everyone in a vulnerable position.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\n\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A 29-year-old doctor from Minnesota is using social media platform TikTok to educate teens about the dangers of vaping.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tJzT_1JPPE8icEIGVCVuAA--~B/aD0xMjY0O3c9MTQ3ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/e776fc10-f1da-11e9-a45b-10b65acdb322", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
