On Instagram, huntlodge commented, \u201cGood for her! Hollywood uses people up and discards them. She stepped aside and prioritized her life \u2026 then came back strong, looking better than ever!\u201d And pietrofhnyc wrote, \u201cShe seems so un\u2013Judy Garland\u2013like that I can\u2019t wait to see her play the role. But I hope she captures the innate humor Judy had along with the pathos and insecurity.\u201d But unger_xx chafed at the headline: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a \u2018lost\u2019 decade. Time off can be extremely fruitful. Not everything of value in life is public.\u201d Added sophiegruetzner, \u201cLost decade? Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby was just three years ago.\u201d @__adamwhite commented, \u201cThis is a remarkable profile that fully burrows into that fascinating blur of strength, vulnerability, and mad eccentricity that has always made Zellweger such a brilliant movie star.\u201d Will Kellogg wrote the story made him \u201cexcited for Judy in a way the trailer did not.\u201d Zellweger\u2019s performance in Judy, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, inspired a standing ovation, prompting one critic to write, \u201cIn 15 years at #TIFF I have never seen a standing ovation like the one for Ren\u00e9e Zellweger \u2026 it only stopped because she made us.\u201d\n\n2 In \u201cHow to Major in Unicorn\u201d (September 2\u201315), Max Read and Andrew Granato assembled a cynic\u2019s guide to excelling at Stanford University. C\u00e9cile Alduy, a French-literature professor at the school, wrote, \u201cThis article is only about computer-science students. But I\u2019ve had some in my \u2026 classes that had entirely different, humanistic attitudes. And the majority of Stanford students do not major in CS. What a relief.\u201d Two humanities majors wrote a rebuttal post on Medium \u2014 \u201cAn Optimist\u2019s Guide to Finding Meaning at Stanford\u201d \u2014 arguing that the guide perpetuates the myths \u201cthat it is not only full of \u2018techies\u2019 but that those techies only care about self-enrichment, networking, and personal success.\u201d Other alums saw glimpses of their time at the school. Naotake Murayama wrote, \u201cThere\u2019s some truth, some useful tips, and lots of required reading between the lines.\u201d @richjaro tweeted, \u201cTo stories about athletics scandals, academic cheating, and campus assault, you can add this to the list of things you never want to see written about your alma mater.\u201d\n\n3 \u201cThe world\u2019s five most powerful millennials now, and maybe for the rest of our lives, are Jared Kushner, Kim Jong-un, Mark Zuckerberg, Stephen Miller, and Mohammed bin Salman,\u201d Noreen Malone argued in \u201cThe Five Millennials Changing the World\u201d (September 2\u201315). Commenter almost.literature wrote, \u201cThe idea that Miller and Kushner are being portrayed in this piece as serious long-term power brokers in the United States\u2014let alone internationally\u2014is just ludicrous. Neither has enough credibility in their appointed fields to provide even a hint of gravitas.\u201d Heidi N. Moore disagreed. \u201cThe next time millennials say they inherited a messed-up world, remind them that, like all generations, they also have a significant hand in making it worse \u2026 Kushner, Miller, and Zuckerberg alone have enabled a level of authoritarian cynicism and genocide that makes any Boomer look like an amateur.\u201d\n\n4 In an essay for the Cut, Natalie Beach reflected on her years-long relationship ghostwriting for the infamous Instagram influencer Caroline Calloway (\u201cI Was Caroline Calloway,\u201d September 10). Within 24 hours, the story had been read by half a million people and prompted the New York Times to write \u201cWho Is Caroline Calloway? An Explainer\u201d and a BuzzFeed quiz, \u201cAre You a Caroline or a Natalie?\u201d Zing Tsjeng called the essay \u201ca real-life Elena Ferrante story for the Instagram generation.\u201d The novelist Curtis Sittenfeld asked, \u201cWas this essay written for my personal delight?\u201d Amanda Fortini wrote, \u201cThe main takeaway from this Caroline Calloway piece (other than Natalie being a fantastically sharp writer) is how absolutely shitty and miserable your twenties are.\u201d Others, though, questioned the writer\u2019s motivations, with Mother Jones\u2019s Clara Jeffrey tweeting, \u201cMaybe if I\u2019d ever heard about Caroline before today I\u2019d read this as something other than essentially becoming and betraying the thing you feel betrayed by.\u201d Hadley Freeman wrote, \u201cThis a great piece of writing about a friendship that is morally complicated on both sides.\u201d The journalist Peter Sterne added, \u201cI thought this would be an expos\u00e9 of an Instagram scammer, but it\u2019s actually a compelling reflection on toxic friendship and the experience of being a young woman in the early 2010s. I hope Natalie writes a memoir.\u201d\n\nSend correspondence to comments@nymag.com.
