There had been just enough time to watch Ben Stokes produce the innings of a lifetime to lead England\u2019s cricket team to victory in the Ashes third Test before the manager of England\u2019s football team left his hotel and made the 12km journey south to Legan\u00e9s. It was late August, he had come to see Kieran Trippier play for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and by the end of a good day for English sport, he decided he liked what he saw. Four days later, the full-back returned to the national squad.\n\nTrippier started in the team that beat Bulgaria 4-0 at Wembley; coming on to join him was Jadon Sancho, the Borussia Dortmund winger who had made his debut in October last year. A month on, they have been called up again. Sancho became the 25th man to represent England while playing abroad, Trippier the 26th. They are the first since David Beckham, formerly of Real Madrid but by then of LA Galaxy, bowed out in 2009.\n\nGareth Southgate seeks to establish England meritocracy without privilege Read more\n\nAnother decade should not go by for it to happen again, the numbers suggest. Sancho is one of six Englishmen in the Bundesliga. In La Liga, Trippier is one of two, with the Osasuna forward Brandon Thomas, Spain-born with an English father, although there are two more Britons: Gareth Bale at Real Madrid and Oliver Burke at Alav\u00e9s. The FA tracks English qualified players weekly: last weekend, on top of Sancho and Tripper, six others started in Europe\u2019s top four leagues: Ronaldo Vieira at Sampdoria, Jonjoe Kenny at Schalke and Lewis Baker at Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf, as well as Dijon\u2019s Stephy Mavididi, Chris Smalling at Roma and Reece Oxford for Augsburg. It is not huge but that figure of eight, the FA believes, is a record.\n\nSome of those players reflect that part of the shift is beneath the surface and is one that could be self\u2011perpetuating. Elite signings and sons of immigrants account for some Englishmen abroad, as may overstocked squads at clubs looking for somewhere to loan. But it is young players seeking a path to first\u2011team football and the clubs who can now track them at youth level that is emerging as a trend and may most drive change \u2013 albeit one potentially threatened by the end of freedom of movement with Brexit.\n\nSancho is a prime example that the greatest attraction of moving abroad can be summed up in a word: opportunity. In the Premier League 30% of starters are English, 19.9% at the top six. Pathways open faster elsewhere, for those prepared to take them. Sancho has 63 first\u2011team appearances at Dortmund, aged 19.\n\nThere are parallels in Trippier\u2019s new home country, even if his case is different. Cesc F\u00e0bregas, who left Spain for England, seeking an opportunity he considered unlikely at home, sums it up. \u201cAt 16, I was training with Thierry Henry and Bergkamp, Pires and Vieira. I\u2019d played 50 games at 17; at 18, I\u2019d played in a Champions League final; at 21, a European Championship final; two years later, a World Cup final.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s the thing: a World Cup final. Migration can be good for national teams, too, and Southgate has defended the benefits of English players going abroad, something so few have done. Almost as soon as he took over, he said: \u201cI always say being an island saved us in 1945. I\u2019m not so sure it\u2019s helped us ever since. We\u2019ve got to broaden horizons. The lads see one league, they think we\u2019re the centre of the Earth and we\u2019re not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been good for us that players went abroad; that\u2019s one of the most important factors,\u201d said Vicente del Bosque, coach when Spain won the 2010 World Cup with three England\u2011based players and Euro 2012 when they had four from the Premier League. \u201cIt opened our minds, a major advance.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kieran Trippier is the 26th player to represent England while playing abroad.

The paths cannot be the same because of the Premier League\u2019s greater financial muscle, salaries making home comforts attractive to players. Spain\u2019s top-flight clubs bring more footballers through partly because they need to and that also means more products to sell.\n\nBut there are parallels and at a basic level it starts with the same word: opportunity. More football for more footballers, widening the pool of first-team minutes and, better still, European minutes, however they got there. There are 17 former Football League players in the latest England squad, plus two playing abroad, chances found below and beyond the biggest clubs. Different, if more circuitous routes to the top.\n\nWhen Southgate called up Sancho, he said: \u201cThere was a stat around Champions League appearances for nationalities and how it\u2019s correlated to success at senior international level, so to have a player starting in the Champions League is important to us. His decision to move tells you something about his character \u2013 he has tremendous belief in himself.\u201d\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nSancho\u2019s experience may help others to believe there is success beyond their borders, Southgate admitting there was an unintended message in bringing him into the squad. Moving abroad is something England embraces. Southgate was not put off by Trippier leaving, doors did not close: he welcomed this, a fresh start for one of his players and at the perfect place.\n\nTrippier had heard people suggest he was going under the radar but he knew better. There had been conversations, encouragement. Last Saturday, Steve Holland, Southgate\u2019s assistant, was back for the Madrid derby.\n\nAtl\u00e9tico are hardly a backwards step in quality while Dortmund was a great leap forward. Trippier began this season\u2019s Champions League campaign by providing a 90th-minute assist against Juventus, Sancho began his tearing into Barcelona.\n\nOn Saturday Sancho travelled to Freiburg, Trippier will travel to Valladolid on Sunday, and then, like the rest of their England teammates, they will head to the Czech Republic and Bulgaria. Unlike the others, though, Trippier and Sancho will have to catch a flight home first.", "description": "Younger players are heading further afield as a path to first-team football and it\u2019s benefiting national teams", "authors": ["Sid Lowe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/185d6f700559cbc39f16bbf5dee2b659cfdf1e49/96_111_3381_2029/master/3381.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=19ed0899fdee978fd3c074f4f658fbbc", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
