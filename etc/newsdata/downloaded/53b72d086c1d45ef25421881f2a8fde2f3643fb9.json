As he got up on stage to start telling jokes, he realized that he was \u201cshaking significantly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was so clear that I was off,\u201d Gulman tells me over coffee on a sunny September afternoon in Burbank. \u201cI wasn\u2019t talking at the same speed, in the same pitch that I normally do. My voice was very strained. So I had to address it because it was so obvious.\u201d Before he could make people laugh, he realized, \u201cI had to acknowledge that I was suffering.\u201d\n\nIn video footage from that night, which opens The Great Depresh, his transcendent new combination stand-up special and documentary on HBO, Gulman sits on a stool and fiddles with the mic stand as he confesses to the crowd, \u201cI have a mental illness. I have a severe mental illness. It\u2019s excruciating.\u201d He repeats, \u201cIt\u2019s excruciating. This is like a cosmic bottom. This is like a bottom.\u201d\n\nNo one laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s the only special, I promise, that opens with the comedian bombing,\u201d he says now.\n\nAt 46 years old, Gulman was just starting to emerge from the worst depressive period of his life. After his time in the mental hospital, he had moved back into his childhood bedroom in his mother\u2019s house in Peabody, Massachusetts. He got a job as a camp counselor for adolescents just so that he would have a reason to get out of bed every day. He wasn\u2019t sure if he could ever be funny again.\n\nTwo years later, Gulman arrives at the Coffee Commissary in Burbank looking tanned and happy with his own reusable Starbucks cup in hand. A long time vegan, he orders an iced coffee black and folds his towering 6'6\" frame into a small patio chair. In one bit I\u2019ve heard him tell on stage, he explains how much he hates it when baristas ask if he wants \u201croom\u201d for milk. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want you to steal six sips,\u201d he jokes.\n\nHe\u2019s just left a meeting at NBC Universal, one of several he\u2019ll be attending during his week in Los Angeles with executives who are potentially interested in adapting his story into a film or TV show.\n\nWhen I tell Gulman how much I enjoyed the new special, he seems unusually grateful. \u201cI cannot tell you how many people I\u2019ve met with this week who haven\u2019t watched it,\u201d he says, an air of disappointment in his voice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to talk about my experience with depression,\u201d he says of his decision to start telling jokes about what he went through on stage. He worried that his audience wouldn\u2019t \u201ctolerate a heavier, deeper show\u201d and that he didn\u2019t personally have \u201cthe skill to pull it off.\u201d\n\nAs he started to work out new material on the road, he felt himself starting to feel better\u2014thanks in large part to antidepressants and therapy. \u201cWas I doing better work because I was feeling better?\u201d he asks himself. \u201cOr was I feeling better because I was doing better work? I think I can objectively say that I was doing better work because I was feeling better.\u201d\n\nHe ultimately had to learn to dissociate his mood from his successes or failures as a comedian. \u201cFor too long, my entire mood was based on my last show,\u201d Gulman says. Because he was trying out such \u201crisky\u201d material about depression, he says he \u201cbombed a lot\u201d along the way.\n\nWhen Gulman left New York City to move back home, he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be back. \u201cI thought that best case I would feel better and realize that New York was too stressful,\u201d he says. It was his manager\u2019s idea that he sit down with director Michael Bonfiglio, who previously directed Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s recent special-documentary hybrid, to talk about doing something similar focused on his recovery. They met the day after Gulman finally returned to New York in May 2018.\n\nBonfiglio said he was interested but asked Gulman, \u201cDo you mind if I run this idea by my friend Judd Apatow?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, of course,\u201d Gulman recalls answering, joking, \u201cThank you for asking.\u201d\n\nApatow, who ended up signing on as a producer, gave Gulman \u201ca lot of notes\u201d during the process but the one that sticks with him came on the night of the taping in Brooklyn. \u201cI was pretty nervous and this was the culmination of a lot of work,\u201d Gulman says. Apatow told him, \u201cTreat this like a film. If you flub a line, just start it over.\u201d The only time he had to do that was during the part of the show where he lists every antidepressant he\u2019s ever taken.\n\n\u201cYou know what my job as a producer was?\u201d Apatow said on stage with Gulman at the Largo theater in Los Angeles during an event to promote the special this past week. \u201cWhen we were choosing which section of you bombing to use, I was the person going, \u2018Not bad enough! Sadder! Worse! Let\u2019s see it in his eyes.\u2019\u201d In a more sincere moment, Apatow praised Gulman for writing \u201csuch an incredible\u201d piece of comedy about his experience.\n\nThe bit that closes The Great Depresh is about how you know you\u2019re depressed when you\u2019re eating ice cream with a fork because you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to wash a spoon. Gulman actually told a version of that joke on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert in early 2017. But at that time he didn\u2019t mention that he was depressed.\n\n\u201cPeople say, why don\u2019t you wash a spoon?\u201d Gulman says in the bit. He answers that question with, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I shower?\u201d It\u2019s funny enough on Colbert but takes on a whole new depth when he gets to it in the special.\n\n\u201cThose were the only five minutes I had written in two and a half years,\u201d he tells me. In early versions of the hour he would start with the ice cream bit and get some easier laughs before heading into the darker material about depression. But in the final product, which will air on HBO this Saturday night, Oct. 5, he dives right in.\n\nAfter explaining that it\u2019s been five years since he shot his last special, Gulman says, \u201cThe reason is that I got very sick with the depresh.\u201d The first really big laughs come when Gulman jokes that growing up in the \u201970s, \u201cThe only antidepressants we had access to was \u2018snap out of it\u2019 and \u2018what have you got to be depressed about?\u2019 That was the second-leading brand of antidepressant.\u201d\n\nAt another point, he jokes that he got recognized almost immediately upon entering a psych ward. \u201cAre you Gary Gulman or am I crazy?\u201d one fellow patient asked him.\n\nThere is a long history\u2014one that has become almost clich\u00e9\u2014of comedians suffering from depression, as well as a disturbing incidence of suicide. There\u2019s even a podcast about it, The Hilarious World of Depression, on which Gulman was a guest about two years ago. This year\u2019s Clusterfest comedy festival in San Francisco featured a panel on \u201cComedy and Mental Health\u201d where comics Jeff Ross, Tig Notaro, Neal Brennan and Michelle Buteau discussed how they cope with depression. And later this fall, Rainn Wilson\u2019s SoulPancake platform, in collaboration with Funny or Die, will release a short documentary called Laughing Matters in which comedians like Sarah Silverman, Wayne Brady and Chris Gethard open up about their mental health struggles.\n\nGulman doesn\u2019t think that comedians are necessarily more susceptible to depression but he does believe that they are more likely to be \u201chonest and vulnerable\u201d about their suffering.\n\nAt Largo, Gulman and Apatow were joined by fellow comedians Patton Oswalt and Maria Bamford, who has been talking about living with bipolar disorder on stage for years and made it a central part of her Netflix series Lady Dynamite. Bamford thinks stand-up comedy is a \u201cgreat thing for somebody with mental health issues\u201d because comedians are used to \u201ctalking about everything openly.\u201d\n\n\u201c The only antidepressants we had access to was \u2018snap out of it\u2019 and \u2018what have you got to be depressed about?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI always felt like I was a very shy person who had a very difficult time speaking extemporaneously or jumping into conversations,\u201d she said, before joking, \u201cOf course not now\u2014fully medicated!\u201d She added, \u201cSo stand-up was this perfect thing where I get to totally be myself and say exactly what I want to say even if nobody wants me to.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Gethard warns in Laughing Matters, \u201cComedy is not going to save you. And if you are thinking about doing comedy as a substitute for therapy, it doesn\u2019t work. I tried for a long time.\u201d\n\nWhen Gulman first started performing stand-up in Boston in 1993, he had already been in therapy and on antidepressants. During his college years, he would sneak in and out of his therapist\u2019s office so no one saw him. He even kept it a secret from his girlfriend because he thought she would be \u201cembarrassed\u201d and break up with him.\n\nThe first time he heard a fellow comedian talk about being on Prozac he was \u201cshocked.\u201d He was \u201cin awe\u201d that someone was \u201cso brave to admit that she is on antidepressants\u201d because it was such a taboo subject. He was similarly amazed while growing up watching comedian Richard Lewis talk openly about his neuroses.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that comedians are any more likely to be depressed,\u201d he says, \u201cbut they are more likely to talk about it with strangers and it\u2019s either bravery or sheer gall, brazenness that causes them to do it.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a myth in the comedy world that if you medicate your depression, you\u2019ll stop being funny. Gulman says he \u201chad enough experience\u201d in his own life with \u201csuffering and the human condition\u201d by the time he went on antidepressants that he had plenty of material to draw on for his comedy. \u201cIt\u2019s a romantic myth, \u2018I need to be troubled to write well,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 30 last year, Gulman had consumed too many cups of coffee when he had an idea. \u201cWhile the coffee was still giving me confidence, I made a huge commitment,\u201d he says. He typed out a tweet: \u201cStarting Jan. 1 I am going to give one joke writing tip each day. I can\u2019t promise they will be effective but they will have worked for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should have said one a week,\u201d he says with a laugh. But he has stuck with it, imparting one piece of advice aimed at young or struggling comedians every day since. He began on Jan. 1 with, \u201cRecord every set. The hard part: Listen to it and transcribe everything you want to say again. It\u2019s sometimes depressing but it gets you to do the hardest part which is to sit down and write. Usually you\u2019ll think of something to add or change. This works for me.\u201d\n\nLast week, he wrote, \u201cWhenever you have a showcase or audition or TV appearance, spend whatever you have to to look right. Arrive early and prepared and if your hands shake when you\u2019re excited get a prescription for a beta blocker. I use propanolol.\u201d\n\nHe plans to keep doing it until Dec. 31 \u201cand then never mention it again.\u201d\n\nAt one point in the special, Gulman says, \u201cI\u2019m only comfortable talking about it now because I\u2019ve come out the other side.\u201d When I ask if he still feels depressed, he says, \u201cI don\u2019t feel any most days, these days,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there was a time when there was a low level for months and months on end.\u201d\n\n\u201c I don\u2019t know that comedians are any more likely to be depressed, but they are more likely to talk about it with strangers. \u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had episodes of depression since I\u2019ve known myself,\u201d he says. \u201cSince 7 years old I can remember having these feelings. The episodes would never last more than a few months. This one lasted for two and a half years.\u201d Since he went into remission in the fall of 2017, he says he\u2019s had the \u201clongest, sturdiest recovery\u201d of his life. \u201cBut it\u2019s in part because I\u2019ve adopted 18 or 20 things that I do every day to stay this way. I\u2019ve never been more vigilant because I\u2019ve never fallen that far.\u201d\n\nDespite all of this\u2014or perhaps because of it\u2014The Great Depresh manages to be the funniest stand-up special I\u2019ve seen this year. And it comes on the heels of more flashy offerings on Netflix from Dave Chappelle and Gulman\u2019s fellow Boston comic Bill Burr, who are deliberately pushing boundaries in a very different way. Whereas Gulman is finding new ways to make depression funny, those comics are telling outrage-inducing jokes about Michael Jackson or Michelle Obama.\n\nGulman\u2019s sensitive special serves as an antidote to their anti-woke comedy.\n\nWhile those comics rail against millennials for being too sensitive, Gulman says he \u201cadmires\u201d them, joking, \u201cYour stance on bullying is to be commended.\u201d He even comes out in favor of \u201cparticipation trophies.\u201d His \u201conly quibble\u201d with millennials, he jokes, is that they have altered the word \u201cliterally\u201d to also mean \u201cfiguratively.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing is I\u2019m married to a millennial and I\u2019m very impressed with her perspective,\u201d Gulman tells me of his wife Sade (\u201cnot the Sade,\u201d he jokes on stage). \u201cGrowing up in Massachusetts as a boy, and a sensitive one, the men in my life were saying, \u2018We need to make you more aggressive, we need to toughen you up.\u2019\u201d His football coaches would say things like, \u201cIf you were more aggressive, there would be no stopping you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat didn\u2019t work on me and I paid a price for it in my psyche,\u201d he says. \u201cI was always hiding things about myself and keeping things secret. Name-calling and bullying, either physical or verbal, was very painful for me growing up and when I saw the stance that millennials seem to be taking, I don\u2019t have nostalgia for that. I could have used some more nurturing than I got and it just happened to be the generation I grew up in. We were just so mean to each other.\u201d\n\nGulman thinks that some of his fellow comics may view sensitivity as \u201ca sign of weakness.\u201d But he thinks \u201cit takes some strength to be soft.\u201d He has a piece in his act now in which he makes fun of other middle-aged white male comics who like to complain that \u201cyou can\u2019t say anything anymore.\u201d\n\nThis divide between more sensitive comics and those on the other side was laid bare this past month during the uproar over Shane Gillis, a stand-up who was hired by Saturday Night Live and then fired just days later after racist and homophobic remarks he had recently made were brought to light. Among them was a riff on his podcast in which he used homophobic slurs to describe both Judd Apatow and Chris Gethard, who released his own HBO special about depression called Career Suicide two years ago.\n\n\u201cYeah, I get called a snowflake a lot,\u201d Gulman says. \u201cSo I\u2019m used to that.\u201d\n\nWhen he hears comedians talk about how sensitive the audience is, he thinks they should look in the mirror. \u201cI find it ironic because I know comedians,\u201d he says. \u201cIn order to do this, look at what I do. I spend my days overreacting to petty injustices and then I race around New York City every night sharing these small slights with complete strangers. It\u2019s the epitome of being sensitive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI get it,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt hurts when an audience groans at something you say. But at the same time, I\u2019m as sensitive as the audience is.\u201d\n\nGulman has never been more honest and personal in his comedy than he is on The Great Depresh. But he says he did so \u201cout of necessity.\u201d A long time ago, his therapist told him something that he only \u201cinternalized\u201d recently: \u201cIf you\u2019re an open book, then nobody has anything on you. Nobody can expose you.\u201d Up until a few months ago, only a handful of people knew he had been in the hospital and \u201cnow everyone will know.\u201d\n\nWhen people watch The Great Depresh, Gulman hopes it will make them see that depression is an \u201cillness\u201d and not a \u201ccharacter flaw.\u201d He wants to stop hearing, \u201cThat\u2019s just life. You get sad and you get nervous and it\u2019s just stress.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew that I had enough to be happy on paper,\u201d he says. \u201cBut not only was I not happy but I hated myself and couldn\u2019t get out of bed. That wasn\u2019t necessary. There\u2019s treatment.\u201d\n\nThroughout his career, Gulman has known that what makes his type of observational comedy work is that the laughs \u201ccome from a place of recognition.\u201d He worried that his experience with depression would be \u201ctoo obscure\u201d for audiences to truly understand. Ultimately, the opposite was true. He thought he was the only one who knew what it was like to \u201chit bottom, both literally and millennial literally\u201d when finishing a full pint of ice cream. But the laughter of the crowd proved he was not alone.\n\nIn the final moments of the special, Gulman arrives at a moment of sincerity. \u201cIf you are suffering from a mental illness, I promise you are not alone. You are not alone,\u201d he tells the audience. After the applause dies down, he adds, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you are alone, but only because you can\u2019t leave the house today. But you should.\u201d", "description": "Gary Gulman thought he would never be able to perform stand-up again.
