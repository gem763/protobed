The antidepressant ads frequently feature a serious physician extolling the virtues of turning your life around with a daily pill.\n\nThat\u2019s because the field is extraordinarily lucrative in the U.S. The antidepressant market was valued at $13.7 billion in 2018 and is expected to reach $15.9 billion by 2025, according to BrandEssence Market Research, an industry consultancy. By comparison, sales in China \u2014 with a population more than four times that of the U.S. \u2014 were estimated to be a mere $8.5 billion last year.\n\nOne reason this number is so low is that the Chinese do not face a bombardment of ads on TV and other media. In China, drug companies are only allowed to advertise in medical journals \u2014 effectively reaching only physicians.\n\nYet the Chinese are beginning to talk more about mental-health disorders, including depression. The opening-up has been \u201csignificant,\u201d according to Fang Wang of the University of Surrey in England. This means that, while there hasn\u2019t been an explosion in ads, there has been a blossoming of the conversation over these disorders.\n\nEli Lilly Still image from a U.S. television commercial for the Eli Lilly prescription drug Cymbalta.\n\nThis is a big change from decades ago, when depression and related mental-health disorders were often marginalized or stigmatized in China. Yet \u201csignificant change in the Chinese discussion of depression and the use of antidepressants has taken place in the last ten years,\u201d Fang and colleague Robert Geyer argue in the latest issue of China Quarterly, a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nYet China is developing so rapidly that it has been hard for regulators to keep up. This columnist visited a dozen pharmacies in the Chaoyang area of Beijing and found you could buy escitalopram \u2014 whose trade name, under Allergan PLC\u2019s AGN, -0.05% manufacture, is Lexapro \u2014 over the counter in about half the stores. In a few, other antidepressants were available without a prescription. (Fluoxetine \u2014 marketed by Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, +2.19% as Prozac \u2014 was not available at any, though you can get it at most Beijing hospitals.)\n\nBut they are not widely consumed in China.\n\nNumbers on Chinese pharmaceutical usage are notoriously hard to come by. But the little data we have suggest that, despite the evolution Wang mentioned, the disorder remains significantly underrecognized and undertreated. A World Health Survey conducted in 2003 showed that only 1% of people with symptoms of depression had been treated in China. By comparison, 35% of Americans with depression were treated.\n\nA more recent study has found that in urban primary-care settings in China, only 3% of elderly citizens with major depressive disorders received treatment by a mental-health-care provider. Less than 1% were treated with an antidepressant, the study found.\n\nThe shocking aspect is that these numbers are actual improvements. One can only imagine the droves of people who suffered in silence during the Cultural Revolution period, when China banished physicians to the countryside and employed poorly trained \u201cbarefoot doctors.\u201d\n\nChina faces enormous public-health challenges. Its diabetes and obesity rates, for instance, are skyrocketing, and its population is aging at an alarming rate, which will put pressure on an already stressed system.\n\nBut mental disorders may be the quietest public-health problem in the country of 1.4 billion, with millions suffering needlessly. The government and public-health experts can foster the still-nascent opening-up that Wang mentioned by encouraging discussion and reducing the stigma surrounding depression.\n\nDoctors, meanwhile, should increase routine screening of depression, anxiety and related mental-health disorders. Studies have shown that a health-care provider\u2019s mere casual inquiry at an office visit can uncover emotional disorders that patients either didn\u2019t know they had or were ashamed to talk about.\n\nAnd Western drug companies will be more than happy to meet the demands of this enormous potential market.\n\nTanner Brown is a contributor to MarketWatch and Barron\u2019s and producer of the Caixin-Sinica Business Brief podcast.", "description": "China\u2019s enormous market potential is hampered by underrecognition of mental-health disorders.", "authors": ["Tanner Brown"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU079_cymbal_MG_20191027192656.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
