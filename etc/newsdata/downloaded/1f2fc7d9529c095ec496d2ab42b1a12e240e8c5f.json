CHEAP!\n\nWith phone images getting sharper each year, most of us got a pretty decent camera in our pockets. But photography is about millisecond precision and responsiveness, and most phone cameras aren\u2019t. So if you\u2019re looking to step up your photography game, you might want to consider upgrading to a real camera \u2014 and we\u2019ve got the just the thing to get you started.\n\nThere\u2019s currently a sweet deal on a Nikon D7500 with a 18-140mm lens included. The photography kit is going for only $899, a massive 48-percent discount off the original price of $1,747.\n\nHere\u2019s what you get for that money:\n\nA 20.9-megapixel CMOS sensor with a max resolution of 2160 x 3840 pixels\n\n4K UHD video recording at 30 fps\n\nNative ISO of up to 51,200, with expanded capability up to to 1,640,000 ISO\n\nBurst mode at 8fps for up to 100 images in a row\n\nA good-looking camera body with a sturdy design\n\nWhat more can you ask for?\n\nLook, the truth is phone cameras are getting really good these days. But\u2026 even the good ones come with some serious drawbacks. I recently detailed my experience using the Huawei P30 Pro (instead of my beloved Fujifilm X100F) to shoot street photography, and the difficulties I ran into. Among other things, the P30 Pro had a slight delay in snapping pics, and generally made me less confident in my ability as a photographer.\n\nIf this sounds like a problem you\u2019re familiar with, now might be the time to consider upgrading to a proper camera. While I haven\u2019t personally used the D7500, Nikon is a brand with a rich history, and my colleague Callum Booth couldn\u2019t be any happier with his D3500.\n\nAnd with almost $850 off, the Nikon D7500 could be the perfect starter kit.\n\nYou know what to do.
