They were wrong. Labour\u2019s benches have been duped. As have Labour members and Labour voters. Along with Jeremy Corbyn, who has ended up duping himself.\n\nIgnore the duplicity of Oliver Letwin and his self-indulgent wrecking amendment. Yes, there will be more parliamentary sophistry. John Bercow and his Remain lieutenants will fight a final, desperate rearguard action. But the momentum is now in one direction.\n\nBoris Johnson has broken the log-jam, and MPs of goodwill on all sides of the House are gravitating towards him. The end is in sight. Brexit is going to happen.\n\nLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn acknowledges supporters in Liverpool yesterday evening\n\nWhen the books of this time are written, it will be interesting to see who they record as the architects of this turning point in the history of a nation. On Thursday, myself and a group of journalists had dinner in Brussels with one of them, Nigel Farage. He was a little down, regarding Boris\u2019s deal as inadequate.\n\n\u2018But this is your moment,\u2019 I said to him. \u2018None of this would have happened without you. Aren\u2019t you tempted to just take the win?\u2019\n\n\u2018If I thought it really was Brexit I\u2019d do that and be off,\u2019 he said. \u2018But I really don\u2019t think this is what we\u2019ve been fighting for.\u2019\n\nAnother who will have their own dedicated chapter is Boris Johnson. The attempt to prorogue Parliament was a debacle. His October 31 deadline turned out to be a millstone round his own neck.\n\nBut he said he believed he could reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, when others said he could not. He was right and they were wrong. He pledged to negotiate in good faith and with an open mind, while his critics claimed he was deliberately attempting to sabotage Brexit and run a Dominic Cummings \u2018People v Parliament\u2019 strategy. He was telling the truth and they were not. He promised to \u2018get Brexit done\u2019. And despite the final frantic attempts of the Remainers, he will do.\n\nBut there is a third hero of Brexit who deserves to have their name sanctified by historians. That man is Jeremy Corbyn. There is no conceivable way Brexit could have been delivered without the contribution of the leader of Her Majesty\u2019s Opposition.\n\nThink of the political landscape that lay before him three weeks ago. The Supreme Court had just moved to block Boris\u2019s final escape route. The Prime Minister was imprisoned by the Benn Act. His majority had been slashed to minus 42. He had no way of forcing an Election. The European Union was unwavering. There was open discussion in the bars and tea rooms of the Commons that the Johnson premiership would prove to be the shortest in British political history.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson smiles in the House of Commons in Westminster yesterday\n\nThe opposition parties and Tory rebels were united in their belief the time had come to remove him and insert a government of national unity. And yet Jeremy Corbyn somehow contrived to let Boris Johnson, and Brexit, break free.\n\nIf you speak to some Labour and Lib Dem MPs, they believe he has always been a corrupt jailer. Back in May, I reported how Corbyn had made approaches to a Labour MP who was minded to back Theresa May\u2019s deal. \u2018He asked him if he would start to unofficially whip our other Brexit-supporting MPs to back May,\u2019 a Shadow Minister told me. \u2018Jeremy wanted to move on from Brexit and thought the only way to do that was to get it over the line. But he couldn\u2019t be seen to be helping dig a Tory Prime Minister out of a hole. So he said it all had to be done without it appearing he was behind it.\u2019 The MP, unsurprisingly, politely declined.\n\nHe\u2019s useless, inadequate, unqualified, disingenuous, and cowardly\n\nSuspicious Remainers have also pointed to Corbyn\u2019s reluctance to threaten to remove the whip from Labour rebels in the run-up to yesterday\u2019s vote.\n\n\u2018He wants it to pass,\u2019 a Shadow Minister told me. \u2018He\u2019s always wanted it to pass.\u2019\n\nCorbyn\u2019s allies reject this. \u2018It\u2019s ironic that the same people who have been attacking deselections as bullying are suddenly backing them in a glorious defence of Remain,\u2019 says one.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Corbyn has always been ideological suspicious of the European project. But his failure to derail Brexit is not actually the product of some grand and masterfully constructed conspiracy. It boils down to something much more simple. Corbyn is the most useless, incompetent, inadequate, unqualified, disingenuous, cowardly person to ever hold senior political office in the United Kingdom.\n\nThat has been evident ever since the 2016 referendum campaign, and his first major opportunity to stop Brexit in its tracks. Had he simply parked his political prejudices and joined with the opposition parties in campaigning robustly for Remain, Labour could have made the difference in a desperately tight contest. But the man who was prepared to share platforms with Hamas, Sinn Fein and the Holocaust denier Paul Eisen refused to share a platform with David Cameron and Tim Farron.\n\nHaving effectively lost that referendum campaign in absentia, Corbyn was then given another chance. Theresa May\u2019s catastrophic 2017 Election campaign saw her fall short of the majority that she needed to force Brexit through a divided Commons.\n\nThe \u2018Absolute Boy\u2019, with the cheers of the Glastonbury faithful ringing in his ears, was presented with not one but two opportunities.\n\nHe could use his position to force May into embracing a Labour Brexit, one that genuinely honoured the commitment to his party\u2019s working-class voters to respect the referendum result. Or he could take a clear, unambiguous stand against Brexit, seize the moment and drive hard for a second referendum. He chose to do neither. Given the opportunity of making a clear pitch for the 52 per cent of the electorate who voted to Leave, or the 48 per cent who voted to Remain, he took the strategically masterful decision to turn his back on each and every one of them.\n\nEd Milband destroyed his political career by adopting the infamous 35 per cent strategy, seeking that portion of the vote.\n\nJeremy Corbyn opted to embrace the 0 per cent strategy.\n\nBut it is not just the major strategic decisions Corbyn has got wrong. It is the major decisions. It is the minor decisions. It\u2019s every decision he has taken on the issue since he first stood at the Dispatch Box and uttered the word \u2018Brexit\u2019.\n\nIn the early stages of his leadership, his tactic was to avoid mentioning the word at all, in the hope the everything would magically go away.\n\nHe could have pleased the 52 per cent or the 48. He opted for 0 per cent\n\nAnd for a while he was supported in that strategy by the high command of the Vote Leave campaign, who much in the way a cornerman props up a sagging boxer, tried to convince their Remain constituency that Corbyn was their champion. But over the past few weeks even they have realised he was punch-drunk beyond repair.\n\nThe recent sacking of Corbyn\u2019s most senior aide, Karie Murphy, was widely reported as a coup by Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell. But in truth it was a coup led by the Remainer camp, who had suddenly woken up to the fact that Corbyn was a busted flush.\n\nBut their awakening came too late. Boris Johnson\u2019s dramatic diplomatic triumph with Leo Varadkar opened the door to last Thursday\u2019s deal, and finally pulled the rug from under the Remain alliance.\n\nIn response, some Corbynite Remainers have fallen back on their favoured approach \u2013 intimidation. \u2018The attacks have been pretty personal,\u2019 says one rebel Labour MP. \u2018It\u2019s been along the lines of, \u201cYou\u2019re not one of us now.\u201d \u2019\n\nBut their political thuggery is having limited effect. Partly that is because, in the wake of the anti-Semitic hounding out of Jewish Labour MP Louise Ellman, a number of them have simply had enough. \u2018They can threaten to deselect me,\u2019 one tells me. \u2018I couldn\u2019t care less now.\u2019\n\nBut it\u2019s also because they and their colleagues realise that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s heart is no longer in the fight.\n\n\u2018He wants to get it over with now,\u2019 one Shadow Minister explains.\n\nThis is a reference to what Labour MP are describing as the Death By Election Strategy: Corbyn suspects he and his party will be annihilated in the upcoming poll, but he sees that as the cleanest way of bringing his leadership to an end.\n\nRemainers put their faith in Jeremy Corbyn. In 2017, a large number of traditional Labour voters also placed their faith in him. But this morning he stands accused of betraying them all.\n\nBrexit is going to happen. But it is going to happen in a way that leaves those who backed it feeling angry, frustrated and abandoned by a Labour Party that they used to call their own.\n\nIn his recent conference speech, Boris Johnson joked about firing Jeremy Corbyn into space.\n\nBut as the Prime Minister stands on the brink of victory, he should actually be considering handing Corbyn a knighthood.
