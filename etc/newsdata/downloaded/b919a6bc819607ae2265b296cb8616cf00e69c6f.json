But he says it doesn\u2019t stop with the platform providers like Microsoft. Institutions using those tools also have to keep trust top of mind or risk alienating their users.\n\n\u201cThat means you need to also ensure that there is trust in the technology that you adopt, and the technology that you create, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to really define the power law on this equation. If you have trust, you will have exponential benefit. If you erode trust it will exponentially decay,\u201d he said.\n\nHe says Microsoft sees trust along three dimensions: privacy, security and ethical use of artificial intelligence. All of these come together in his view to build a basis of trust with your customers.\n\nNadella said he sees privacy as a human right, pure and simple, and it\u2019s up to vendors to ensure that privacy or lose the trust of their customers. \u201cThe investments around data governance is what\u2019s going to define whether you\u2019re serious about privacy or not,\u201d he said. For Microsoft, they look at how transparent they are about how they use the data, their terms of service and how they use technology to ensure that\u2019s being carried out at runtime.\n\nHe reiterated the call he made last year for a federal privacy law. With GDPR in Europe and California\u2019s CCPA coming on line in January, he sees a centralized federal law as a way to streamline regulations for business.\n\nAs for security, as you might expect, he defined it in terms of how Microsoft was implementing it, but the message was clear that you needed security as part of your approach to trust, regardless of how you implement that. He asked several key questions of attendees.\n\n\u201cCyber is the second area where we not only have to do our work, but you have to [ask], what\u2019s your operational security posture, how have you thought about having the best security technology deployed across the entire chain, whether it\u2019s on the application side, the infrastructure side or on the endpoint, side, and most importantly, around identity,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nThe final piece, one which he said was just coming into play, was how you use artificial intelligence ethically, a sensitive topic for a government audience, but one he wasn\u2019t afraid to broach. \u201cOne of the things people say is, \u2018Oh, this AI thing is so unexplainable, especially deep learning.\u2019 But guess what, you created that deep learning [model]. In fact, the data on top of which you train the model, the parameters and the number of parameters you use \u2014 a lot of things are in your control. So we should not abdicate our responsibility when creating AI,\u201d he said.\n\nWhether Microsoft or the U.S. government can adhere to these lofty goals is unclear, but Nadella was careful to outline them both for his company\u2019s benefit and this particular audience. It\u2019s up to both of them to follow through.", "description": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, delivering the keynote at the Microsoft Government Leaders Summit in Washington, DC today, had a message for attendees to maintain user trust in their tools technologies above all else.
