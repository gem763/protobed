(Jenny Kane/AP)\n\nSACRAMENTO \u2014 For the past two months, residents here in California\u2019s capital have been inundated by mysterious ads on Facebook and Twitter, warning that the government is about to destroy the Internet as they know it.\n\n\u201cThe FREE websites and apps you use every day could start costing you,\u201d announced one such ad on Twitter.\n\n\u201cUsing the internet shouldn\u2019t hurt your wallet,\u201d began another that predicted browsing the Web could someday seem like paying at the pump for gasoline.\n\nLittle did viewers know, though, that the ads came from a lobbying organization representing the very social media sites they were using. They appeared to target mostly people located in or around the state\u2019s capital. And they reflected just how hard Facebook, Google and other tech giants in Silicon Valley have tried to muscle changes into the country\u2019s first-ever consumer privacy law before its protections take effect in January.\n\n[\u2018There\u2019s going to be a fight here to weaken it\u2019: Inside the lobbying war over California\u2019s landmark privacy law]\n\nAdopted last year, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) grants Web users the right to see the personal information that companies collect about them and stop it from being sold. The law applies only to residents of the Golden State, but its backers hope it might someday spur regulators around the country to follow suit \u2014 and force the tech giants to change their practices nationwide.\n\n\u201cWe will have in place the first consumer privacy act in the country,\u201d said Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson, a top Democrat in the state legislature.\n\nBut powerful business organizations \u2014 representing retailers, marketers and tech giants \u2014 have responded by seeking sweeping revisions to the law before it goes into effect. So far, they haven\u2019t been successful in a campaign that privacy advocates deride as an attempt to weaken consumers\u2019 rights. But they haven\u2019t relented, either, with only two weeks remaining to California\u2019s legislative calendar.\n\nThe lobbying barrage even has involved their own websites: A page on Facebook and an account on Twitter called Keep the Internet Free began sharing videos this summer encouraging people to spare online advertisers from adhering to some of California\u2019s new privacy rules.\n\nDon\u2019t let every click cost you. Tell your legislators to protect your wallet and your internet TODAY! \u2014 Keep The Internet Free (@freeinternet_ca) June 22, 2019\n\nOne set of ads \u2014 running on Twitter beginning mid-August \u2014 has been seen already by about 184,000 people, all located in Sacramento, according to Twitter\u2019s ad archive. Only by navigating to the website for Keep the Internet Free are its origins revealed: A line at the bottom of the site says it\u2019s the \u201cproject of the Internet Association,\u201d a trade group for Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anything we supported weakened the law at all,\u201d said Kevin McKinley, the director of government affairs in California for the Internet Association. Rather, he said, the goal had been to make it \u201ceasier for businesses to understand.\"\n\nFacebook declined to comment, and Google did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPrivacy advocates always anticipated such a fight given the unlikely \u2014 and messy \u2014 circumstances that produced California\u2019s novel digital protections in the first place. State legislators adopted the CCPA at lightning speed in 2018, under an agreement that was meant to stave off an even more aggressive ballot initiative.\n\nIn doing so, Golden State leaders had accomplished in a matter of days what has eluded their federal counterparts for more than a decade, even in the face of massive privacy scandals at tech giants including Facebook and Google.\n\n[U.S. government issues stunning rebuke, historic $5 billion fine against Facebook for repeated privacy violations]\n\nBut California\u2019s haste also resulted in a law riddled with drafting errors and unresolved issues over what kind of information it covers and how consumers could stop the sale of their data. The holes left tech companies, privacy advocates and lawmakers in a rare alignment that they had to update the law this year \u2014 a process that opened the door to another round of legislative wrangling.\n\nOn one side were consumer groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, Common Sense Media and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which sought to strengthen California\u2019s rules. They aimed to limit the ways companies like Facebook or Google could tap and monetize it for their own purposes, something the CCPA doesn\u2019t really restrict now. Privacy advocates further sought to give consumers the rare power to sue companies in the event that their personal information was mishandled, an idea backed by California\u2019s attorney general, Xavier Beccera, who will become the CCPA\u2019s chief enforcer when the law goes into effect.\n\nBut their efforts to toughen the CCPA soon faltered. Lawmakers weren\u2019t sold on empowering privacy lawsuits, and advocates faced a barrage of opposition from well-funded business lobbyists, who argued the proposals would hamstring the Internet and expose companies to unnecessary legal risk. A robust bill to strengthen the privacy act never came to the legislature for a vote.\n\nOrganizations like the Internet Association and the California Chamber of Commerce \u2014 representing a broad swath of Silicon Valley and other industries \u2014 mounted their own offensive. They turned out in force for a critical Senate hearing this July, where lobbyists stepped up to a microphone and expressed support for tweaks that would have limited what qualifies as personal information under the CCPA.\n\nAt the moment, California\u2019s rules grant consumers the right to opt out of the sale of data that\u2019s linked directly to them or that someday could be linked to them. By trying to narrow what qualifies as personal information, however, the tech industry essentially would have been restricting how and when consumers can invoke their rights under the state\u2019s privacy law.\n\nTestifying at the hearing, Sarah Boot, who oversees privacy work at the California Chamber of Commerce, said the changes wouldn\u2019t strip people of their new privacy protections. \u201cThis is not workable,\u201d she said of the law as written. (The organization did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nBut Jackson, who oversees the chamber\u2019s Judiciary Committee, responded in frustration. Seated at the head of the dais, she ripped into the proposal as an attempt by the industry to take data and \u201csell it and use it any way they want,\u201d undermining California\u2019s intent. Privacy groups, including the ACLU, sided with her, and Jackson led her colleagues in blocking the measure\u2019s advance.\n\n[I found your data. It\u2019s for sale.]\n\nWith the legislature slated to adjourn by mid-September, lawmakers in the California Assembly and Senate instead are expected to consider more broadly supported technical fixes, including a proposal that would ensure the state\u2019s new privacy rules don\u2019t upend shopping and travel loyalty programs.\n\n\u201cThere were attempts to weaken the law to some extent, and we held the line as much as possible,\u201d said Ed Chau, a top Democratic assemblyman who helped write the CCPA, during an interview in his office in the Capitol.\n\nBut there remains a lingering fear that high-powered tech lobbyists could make a final, successful push with last-minute, late-night amendments changing \u2014 and potentially weakening \u2014 the law.\n\nThe Internet Association, for example, has continued to push legislators to make what it has called an \u201cads fix.\u201d With its business peers, the group has sought more legal latitude around ads targeting people based on their shopping habits or Web history, arguing those ads are tied to a specific device or web browser, not an identifiable person. The change would exempt much of the ad industry\u2019s pervasive online tracking from California\u2019s rules requiring companies to obtain consumers\u2019 permission when their data is sold, according to privacy advocates who oppose such an exemption.\n\nUsing the internet shouldn't hurt your wallet. Help protect the free websites and apps you depend on every day by telling California lawmakers to support the ads fix! \u2014 Keep The Internet Free (@freeinternet_ca) June 22, 2019\n\nThe Internet Association has spent nearly $176,000 lobbying on the matter and other issues over the past three months, according to state ethics records, the most it has ever spent in a single three-month period in Sacramento. Online, its Keep the Internet Free campaign calls on visitors to sign a petition arguing that California\u2019s consumer privacy law was \u201cnever intended to prohibit the use of tailored online ads,\u201d a major source of revenue for most free-to-use sites.\n\nMcKinley, the group\u2019s top lobbyist in California, said tech giants, online publications, Web retailers and others rely on the exchange of this information to make ads work, which they don\u2019t see as a sale. \u201cWe have pushed from last year to this year,\u201d he said, and \u201cwe\u2019re going to continue to seek clarification.\u201d\n\nThe lobbying barrage increasingly has worried supporters of the law, who hoped California\u2019s position \u2014 as the nation\u2019s most populous state and the home of the tech sector \u2014 would provide the leverage to compel tech giants to provide the benefits of the CCPA nationwide. Many say the fight to preserve their work is only just beginning, expressing alarm that the tech industry\u2019s efforts won\u2019t subside at the end of 2019.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t underestimate the power of the tech industry,\u201d Jackson warned.\n\nDig Deeper: Personal tech + Privacy\n\nWant to learn about how to keep your personal information private?
