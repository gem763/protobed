Goodbye Megan, hello Jules. Her friends spent a week quizzing her about her choice and then moved on. It was a new school year, and everyone was starting over. Someone had a new haircut and pierced ears; someone got glasses; someone stopped playing soccer and joined the band; someone switched lunch tables. Big deal.\n\nI\u2019m jealous of my childhood self now when I remember that every fall we got to start over, as if our lives were getting a routine software upgrade. I cleaned out my book bag, tossed old notebooks, lined up fresh pencils, got my feet measured for new shoes and showed up to school ready to learn. I bemoaned the end of summer, but I also loved the sense of possibility a new grade held. Mystery and possibility don\u2019t come calling for us so often in adulthood. When we get out of school, we lose that annual prompt for reinvention. I miss it.\n\nWithout that automatic opportunity to reintroduce ourselves to the world, we get a chance at a reboot only if we manufacture it. So I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m going to look at this fall as if I\u2019m starting the next level in school. If I pick up where I left off, that would put me in (please hold while I count on my fingers \u2026) 40th grade.\n\nI\u2019m starting 40th grade by changing how I allocate my time. First, I\u2019m setting my alarm 12 minutes earlier, downloading the Calm app and adding guided meditation to my mornings. Before I start responding to various stimuli, I want to begin the day on my own terms, in peace. Second, I\u2019ve cut back my hours at my day job, meaning I\u2019ll be able to sit right down to my writing most days instead of opening work email. Will meditating for a few minutes help me take a more serene approach to life? Will I get more work done on my new schedule? Or with less regular income and more solitude, will I go broke and/or insane? In 40th grade, I\u2019ll find out!", "description": "When we become adults, we lose the prompt to reboot our lives every fall.
