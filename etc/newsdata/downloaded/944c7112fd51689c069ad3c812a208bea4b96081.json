The cases were opened and a second later, the mosquitoes swarmed out.\n\nThis was a landmark moment in the long history of malaria control as it was the first ever release of genetically-modified mosquitoes on the African continent. It was also the very first step in a 12-year experiment to reduce the population of one species of the insect that is responsible for most of the 4,000 malaria deaths in Burkina Faso every year.\n\nResearchers from the Target Malaria consortium, a not-for-profit research group funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and various research institutions, have developed a mosquito in their laboratory that can kill off its own species by spreading a faulty gene.\n\nIf it works in the wild, the technology \u2013 called gene drive \u2013 could help eliminate malaria where decades of efforts involving bed nets, repellents and insecticides have failed.", "description": "At the start of the rainy season earlier this year \u2013 when mosquitoes multiply and malaria strikes \u2013 scientists, officials and journalists gathered in the small village of Bana, Burkina Faso.", "authors": ["Anna Pujol-Mazzini", "Bill Gates", "Daniel Berman"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/global-health/2019/10/02/P1020627-EDIT-1-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqEo7ukXPj3dSVEb29e9SgAHA4jfmUlGLwXRgQg3wF9CQ.JPG?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
