And they\u2019ve hit out in possibly the pettiest and most savage way possible: A very selective drink promotion.\n\nToday, the giant juice chain is offering cheap fruity concoctions to literally everyone in the country.\n\nEveryone, that is, except Abbey, Baden, Luke, and Harry. The four people that voted her off.\n\nFull price for you lot, I\u2019m afraid. Pia gets the discount, but. Because loyalty gets you the cheap juice. Maybe not the $500,000 and the title of Sole Survivor. But the cheap juice at the very least.\n\nWe\u2019re not entirely sure if they\u2019ve extended the discount ban to blanket every person named Abbey, Baden, Harry, and Luke. But if you\u2019re sporting one of those monikers you might just have to take this one for the team. Abbie\u2019s might be able to get away with it but that\u2019s a fraught gauntlet to run.\n\nEither way, that\u2019s a spectacular piece of corporate pettiness and we are extremely into it. You can\u2019t come back from that. I mean, what\u2019s Harry gonna do? Not give Janine a scoop of a fancy new ice cream he\u2019s made or whatever?\n\nYou can\u2019t beat big business, my dude. Not in this scenario.", "description": "Janine Allis might be taking it well, but Boost Juice is reacting to her getting voted off Survivor in a very petty manner.
