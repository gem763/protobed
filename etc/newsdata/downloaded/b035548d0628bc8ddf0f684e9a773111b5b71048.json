Asked for more details, the spokesman said simply: \"Wells Fargo Digital i Cash has been proven.\"\n\n\u201cAs a result of the increasing digitization of banking services globally, we see a growing demand to further reduce friction regarding traditional borders, and today\u2019s technology puts us in a strong position to do that,\u201d said Lisa Frazier, head of the bank's Innovation Group, in today\u2019s release.\n\n\u201cWe believe DLT holds promise for a variety of use cases, and we\u2019re energized to take this significant step in applying the technology to banking in a material and scalable way,\u201d she added. \u201cWells Fargo Digital Cash has the potential to enable Wells Fargo to remove barriers to real-time financial interactions across multiple accounts in multiple marketplaces around the world.\n\nInterestingly, among Wells Fargo\u2019s investors is Warren Buffett, who last year described Bitcoin as \u201crat poison.\u201d He did, however, describe the underlying technology, blockchain \u2014 or in Wells Fargo\u2019s case, \u201cDLT\u201d \u2014 as \u201cimportant.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, commenters online have pointed out the bank's own (recent) stance on cryptocurrency:\n\nI\u2019m old enough to remember when Wells Fargo froze user accounts used to purchased cryptocurrency. Life moves pretty fast. https://t.co/u2QnujAiL6 \u2014 \u0e3fully (@BullyEsq) September 17, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nWells Fargo isn\u2019t the first major lender to unveil crypto program. Early this year, JP Morgan announced its own proprietary cryptocurrency and blockchain network, dubbed JPM Coin and Quorum respectively.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Banking giant Wells Fargo is beginning a pilot for a digital currency, with plans to use it to cheaply settle cross border trades.", "authors": ["Ben Munster"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GaOX4GuRUUeLZyLnbNSxnA--~B/aD00NzA7dz05MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/decrypt_251/70723d80f5069768aa5925bb259a34cf", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
