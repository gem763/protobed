Correspondence seen by Business Insider confirms that officials working for Johnson intervened to ensure her attendance on the trips.\n\nLast month the GLA's monitoring officer referred the matter to the independent police complaints watchdog to judge whether it warranted a full criminal investigation into a potential misconduct in office offence.\n\nArcuri denied a report in last week's Sunday Times that Johnson had recommended her for a senior tech job as fake news, adding: \"Boris never wrote me a letter. Never.\"\n\nIn a bizarre moment when asked by host Piers Morgan whether Johnson had ever used the pole-dancing pole in her flat, she replied \"I'm never going to tell you that.\"\n\nPressed again about her relationship with Johnson, she asked Morgan: \"has it been ten minutes yet. Are you falling in love with me?\"", "description": "Boris Johnson is accused of granting public funds and access to foreign trade missions to his \"close friend\" and tech entrepeneur Jennifer Arcuri.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7897/9650039f34c440679f8cb47ffc9519c1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
