Tarbert believes ether (ETH) is a commodity, and thus falls under the jurisdiction of the CFTC. He also anticipates ether futures trading on U.S. markets in the near future.\n\n\u201cWe've been very clear on bitcoin: bitcoin is a commodity. We haven't said anything about ether\u2014until now,\u201d Tarbert said on stage at Yahoo Finance\u2019s All Markets Summit in New York City on Thursday. \u201cIt is my view as chairman of the CFTC that ether is a commodity.\u201d\n\nTarbert agrees with the SEC\u2019s previous guidance that bitcoin and ether are not securities. And he says the CFTC is working with the SEC on these issues.\n\nThe CFTC first stated that it views \u201cbitcoin and other virtual currencies\u201d as commodities back in 2015 (long before the SEC did), buried in a filing when it brought charges against a company called Coinflip. But this is the first time the CFTC has given guidance on ether.\n\nTarbert acknowledges \u201cambiguity in the market\u201d on the status of many coins, but says that ultimately \u201csimilar digital assets should be treated similarly.\u201d\n\n[Read more: What is Ethereum, what is ether?]\n\nPerhaps most interestingly, Tarbert says that \u201cforked\u201d assets\u2014cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash (BCH), bitcoin gold (BTG), and ethereum classic (ETC), coins created via forks from the original underlying blockchain\u2014should be treated by regulators the same as the original asset. In other words, the CFTC\u2019s classification of each coin depends on how the coin was created.\n\n\u201cIt stands to reason that similarly assets should be treated similarly. If the underlying asset, the original digital asset, hasn\u2019t been determined to be a security and is therefore a commodity, most likely the forked asset will be the same,\u201d Tarbert said, \u201cunless the fork itself raises some securities law issues under that classic Howey Test.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cHowey Test\u201d refers to a 1946 case involving the selling of shares in a citrus grove that the SEC now uses as its north star in determining whether a digital currency behaves like a security. SEC director of corporate finance Bill Hinman, speaking at Yahoo Finance\u2019s All Markets Summit: Crypto in San Francisco in June of last year, explained that newly created tokens are likely securities because they are marketed with \u201cthe promise that the assets will be cultivated in a way that will cause them to grow in value, to be sold later at a profit,\u201d and \u201ctypically are sold to a wide audience rather than to persons who are likely to use them on the network.\u201d\n\nBitcoin and ether, on the other hand, Hinman and the SEC see as sufficiently decentralized and not controlled by a third party \u201cwhose efforts are a key determining factor in the enterprise.\u201d Thus Hinman determined that sales of bitcoin and ether are not securities transactions.\n\nCFTC Chairman Tarbert was asked on stage by Yahoo Finance\u2019s Scott Gamm whether the Howey Test is really relevant anymore in 2019. He says it is: \"I think the analysis is pretty sound. It has stood the test of time. Ultimately it goes to the fundamental question: is this something that is being used for capital raising, and are you investing in an enterprise, or are you buying something that has tangible store of value in and of itself?\u201d\n\nTarbert also gave insight on how he and the CFTC view coins created through initial coin offerings (ICOs). He believes it is possible for a new coin to start out as a security but eventually become a commodity. \u201cYou can have a situation where something in an initial coin offering is a security initially, but over time, it gets more decentralized, and there's a tangible value there, so you can have things that change back and forth.\u201d", "description": "CFTC chairman Heath Tarbert believes ether (ETH) is a commodity and falls under the jurisdiction of the CFTC\u2014and he expects to see ether futures contracts.", "authors": ["Daniel Roberts", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8pqYkINA4dRakbqvUIemWw--~B/aD0zMzM2O3c9NTAwNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/9b71ccb0-eafe-11e9-8f13-0b85524d4318", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
