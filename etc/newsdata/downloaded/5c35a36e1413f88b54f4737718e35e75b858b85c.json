They were linked to a massive $15 million temple the brothers are building in their hometown of Saharanpur.\n\nZuma appeared before the state capture commission in July, but withdrew on grounds that he had been \"treated as someone who was accused,\" according to his lawyers. He has agreed to return at a future date.\n\nThe former president's 35-year-old son Duduzane Zuma testified this week, after he was accused by witnesses of acting as a conduit for the Guptas' bribery.\n\nHe dismissed testimonies of a former deputy finance minister who said he was offered a $40-million bribe by Ajay Gupta at a meeting arranged by Duduzane Zuma, who was in a business partnership with the brothers.\n\n\"I'm not corrupt, I have not taken money from anybody, I never have and I never will,\" Duduzane Zuma told the inquiry on Tuesday.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa, who succeeded Zuma, has vowed to root out corruption.\n\nMeanwhile, a South African court is scheduled to rule Friday on whether to press on with an earlier case involving corrupt payments Zuma allegedly received from a French arms company during the 1990s.", "description": "The US Treasury announced sanctions Thursday on South Africa's Gupta business family, close friends of ex-president Jacob Zuma, calling them a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/19/wire-19552694-1570730864-710_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
