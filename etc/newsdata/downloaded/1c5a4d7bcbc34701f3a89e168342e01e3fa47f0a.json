The photo was then swiftly deleted, a source told the Mail.\n\nThey added that the label president had since been shunned by some music industry colleagues, including rapper Stormzy who banned him from standing near the stage during his Glastonbury performance.\n\nMr Cook was at Atlantic for 12 years, first working at the label's sister company Asylum Records, where he discovered Sheeran and, along with colleague Ed Howard, gave him his first record deal. Mr Cook became Atlantic's UK president in 2014.\n\nOver the years he has also worked closely with music stars including Clean Bandit, Rudimental and Anne-Marie.\n\nRun-DMC were Jammaster Jay (Jason Mizell), Run (Joseph Simons) and DMC (Darryl McDaniels)\n\nMr Cook also helped to bring Stormzy to the label last year as part of a joint venture with the rapper's own Merky Records outfit. In a statement Cook said he was previously reprimanded by the label for dressing as a member of the American hip-hop group, but that new allegations about his appearance prompted his departure.\n\n'It is with great sadness that today I announce I am stepping down as president of Atlantic Records UK', he said.\n\n'Seven years ago, at a birthday party where guests were asked to come dressed as their favourite musical icon, I came as a member of Run-DMC. Late last year rumours began to circulate about my appearance at that event, many of which are simply untrue.\n\n'While my intention was to honour a musical hero, I recognise my appearance was offensive and I made a terrible mistake.'\n\nMr Cook was at Atlantic for 12 years, first working at the label's sister company Asylum Records, where he discovered Ed Sheeran\n\nMr Cook went on to explain that he 'readily agreed' to disciplinary actions from Atlantic Records, but that allegations about the party had continued. 'I am devastated that this mistake has caused upset and has called into question my commitment to diversity, equality and inclusion, values which I have championed throughout my career', he said.\n\n'I unreservedly apologise to anyone who has been hurt.'\n\nA statement from Warner Music, the parent company of Atlantic, said: 'Ben Cook is leaving Atlantic UK and this will be his last week in the office.'\n\nThe controversy comes weeks after Canadian premier Justin Trudeau was heavily criticised for wearing black face paint at several parties as a younger man.\n\nMr Cook was defended by grime MC Wiley, who worked with him on the 2008 hit Wearing My Rolex and tweeted: 'Ben Cook is not racist. Give that man back his job.'", "description": "Atlantic Records UK president Ben Cook, who is also credited with launching the Ed Sheeran's career, said the fancy dress idea had been a 'terrible mistake'.", "authors": ["Alisha Rouse", "Jim Norton For The Daily Mail", "Richard Spillett For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/08/19825314-0-image-a-11_1571298077968.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
