(Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nYou should go to your optometrist more than once every twelve years. That\u2019s called being an adult and having good common sense. I, however, am bad at adulting and somehow found myself in my early thirties, wearing a severely outdated prescription. How bad was it? I was at the point where after leaving the subway, I needed to take out my iPhone and use the camera to zoom in on the next street to see what direction I should walk in.\n\nEyeQue VisionCheck WHAT IS IT? An at-home test to check your prescription PRICE $102 LIKE Checking my prescription in my pajamas. Can order glasses online via app. NO LIKE I still had to go to the optometrist. The optometrist's prescription was more accurate.\n\nThat\u2019s why I jumped at the chance to check out EyeQue VisionCheck. For $102, you can ostensibly check your vision via an \u201coptical smartphone attachment\u201d and then actually order glasses online. As someone with phone anxiety and a deep existential hatred of doctors\u2019 offices \u2014 it\u2019s a dream come true.\n\nInitially, I was wary that something like this could work to any degree. When I saw EyeQue had won the CES 2019 Innovation Award, I felt somewhat reassured that the worst that could happen was I got a bunk pair of glasses. While some CES Innovation Awards border on wacky (This Umay Rest Thermal Meditation band?), it\u2019s also awarded to legitimate products like the Lenovo Yoga Book C930 or the Sony WH-100xM3 headphones.\n\nThe idea behind the EyeQue is it\u2019s essentially a miniature, phone-based version of that large contraption at your optometrist's office \u2014 an autorefractor. You know, that hulking machine you sit at and stare at a picture of a blurry house or hot air balloon until it gradually comes into focus. (It\u2019s used to estimate your prescription, before further refining it with a phoropter while you look at a \u201cBig E\u201d chart.)\n\nHow it works is you first download the EyeQue VisionCheck app for iOS or Android, and strap the mini refractometer to your phone screen.\n\nThen you stick it to your eye, and what you end up seeing are two discrete lines \u2014 one green, one red. Your job is essentially to merge the green and red lines together into one yellow one, with the help of some touch sensors on the side of the device. You do this about eight times per eye, which altogether make up one test. This somehow measures how light is refracted into your eye and voil\u00e1, the app spits out a prescription.\n\nThe second half of the test involves a pair of plastic glasses to measure your pupillary distance \u2014 or, the distance between your pupils. You basically stick the glasses on, take a selfie with the app, and then mark the centre of your pupils and the glasses\u2019 bridge with some little green x\u2019s.\n\nIf you\u2019re used to getting your glasses from a physical store, it\u2019s not a measurement you\u2019ve probably heard of. Conversely, online services all rely on pupillary distance to give you the best possible fit.\n\nI look stupid. (Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo)\n\nIf this sounds wacky, it kind of is. You will look stupid. I most definitely did. To learn how to properly take the test, I had a Skype demo with the EyeQue folks. In the process, I got a fair number of looks from bewildered coworkers. It also takes about 15 minutes to really get a feel for what you\u2019re supposed to do, thought there are tutorials within the app to help.\n\nI also found the sensors to be a bit difficult to press, meaning they\u2019re probably not the best for the elderly or people with limited mobility in their hands. EyeQue recommended you take at least three tests for accuracy, but since it\u2019d been so long since my last eye test, they advised I take the test an additional three times just to be safe. All in all, it took about an hour for me to finish 6 tests. Once that was done, I put in an order for a new pair of glasses, which arrived about two weeks later.\n\nAs I expected, years of sitting hunched over my computer screen meant my eyesight had deteriorated. My old prescription jumped from -7 in each eye to -7.75. The cylindrical measurement for my right eye went from -1.25 to -2.25. My axis measurement in the right eye stayed about the same, going from 170 to 164. My left eye, however, worsened from 10 to 29.\n\nBut how accurate were these readings really? Sure, when I put on the pair I\u2019d ordered through EyeQue, my initial thought was \u201cOh, so that\u2019s how faraway things are supposed to look.\u201d That said, small print or distant signs were still blurry. If I closed my left eye, things got way fuzzier.\n\nMany moons ago, a doctor told me my eyes were \u201ctragically bad\u201d thanks to severe astigmatism. That made me wonder if the reason my vision was still blurry was because EyeQue couldn\u2019t handle eyes as bad as mine. To find out I had to suck it up, put my health insurance to good use, and go to an optometrist.\n\nYou use these three toggles to align a red and green line. That somehow measures the refraction of light in your eyeball. (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nSo off I went. In addition to finding out I had many, many things wrong with my eyes (don\u2019t sleep with contacts in), the doctor also told me to throw the EyeQue in the garbage. After a vision test, she determined my prescription was in fact, -9 in the right eye and -8 in the left.\n\nOther than that the cylindrical and axis measurements were relatively similar. I was still -2.25 and 165 in the right, and -1.25 and 15 in the left. That didn\u2019t seem all that different to me, but my optometrist thought otherwise. Looking at the EyeQue readings, she noted that it failed to catch my right eye was much worse than my left\u2014a fact I vaguely remembered my childhood doctor telling me as well.\n\nTo drive the point home, she had me try and read letters off a chart with the prescription she wrote for me, and then with the one EyeQue had given. Things were undeniably much clearer with my optometrist\u2019s prescription. (That said, my right eye is so bad my doctor said it\u2019s unlikely I\u2019ll ever get 20/20 vision, even with glasses.)\n\nIn my doctor\u2019s opinion, something like EyeQue would probably be fine for someone with a low prescription, without more complex issues like astigmatism. She was also quick to point out that it would not be a good idea for contacts, and strongly emphasised that devices are unable to diagnose serious conditions like macular degeneration, cataracts, or glaucoma. Not that EyeQue claims it can do any of those things \u2014 it doesn\u2019t.\n\nBut I can see how it might be easy to conflate vision tracking with overall eye health. Similarly, people sometimes hail the Apple Watch as a device that might save your life simply because it can now monitor for irregular heart rate or arrhythmia. However, just because an Apple Watch doesn\u2019t sound an alarm, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re free and clear. In the same vein, if EyeQue doesn\u2019t detect worsening vision, that doesn\u2019t mean your eyes are in perfect health.\n\nIf you look into the refractometer, you\u2019ll see a red and green line. During the tests you have to align them into a single yellow one. (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nFinally, while EyeQue did win a CES Innovation Award, that\u2019s not a substitute for something like FDA clearance. Sure, it sounds impressive but winning an award isn\u2019t the same thing as earning a certification from a government agency.\n\nI went back to EyeQue with my optometrist's concerns, and my different results. An EyeQue spokesperson emailed me back, writing, \u201cThere\u2019s actually no magic number. Optometrists generally consider variance up to 0.5 diopters as acceptable \u2014 meaning if you visited a different ophthalmologist on the same day, you would likely get a slightly different prescription.\u201d\n\nEyeQue also said that the results I got from its test was comparable to the one my optometrist gave me. That struck me as odd, given my optometrist\u2019s reaction. They also told me that 90 per cent of their customers surveyed said glasses they ordered via EyeQue performed the same (33 per cent) or better (53 per cent) than previous pairs.\n\nIt\u2019s true the EyeQue glasses I ordered were better than my old ones. It\u2019s also true the glasses I got with my optometrist\u2019s prescription were even better. Vision is important, and it stands within good reason that I\u2019d want the best possible prescription for my money.\n\nThese white frames are used to measure your pupillary distance \u2014 a measurement you need to order glasses online. (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\n\u201cEyeQue is designed to be used between doctor\u2019s visits to get more people engaged with their eye health. The convenience of having these devices at home means you can take a quick test any time you feel your vision, or your family\u2019s vision has changed,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nThat last bit sounds fair. Except, if I still have to go to my optometrist, who will likely check my vision each time I go, then what is the point again? Savings? If the actual cost of frames and lenses is the issue, well EyeQue isn\u2019t really going to solve that. I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s a good means of further engaging with your health either. After all, it took 12 years to feel my vision had changed and that maybe I needed a checkup. Plus, it might just be my doctor, but she didn\u2019t find my EyeQue results that compelling or helpful.\n\nThe prescription I got here didn\u2019t account for my right eye being much worse than my left \u2014 though the cylindrical and axis measurements were close. (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nSo if not savings, is it convenience? While I found EyeQue easier to use the more tests I did, I wouldn\u2019t call it easier than telling my optometrist whether or not something was clearer or blurrier. Sure, it was cool that I could spend an hour at home in my jammies, staring into a tube attached to my phone. But that hour roughly added up to the amount of time I spent filling out forms, waiting, and finally being examined at the doctor\u2019s. Start to finish, ordering a pair of glasses through EyeQue and ordering them on my own took about the same amount of time.\n\nThe most valuable thing I got from this experience was it forced me to go to the optometrist. EyeQue would probably say that was the goal all along. I could see this as being useful for anyone who lives in a remote area, where it\u2019s not at all easy to get to an optometrist. It might also come in handy for the disabled. Or if your only pair of glasses broke and you just needed a new pair of glasses quickly without fussing with insurance or finding an optometrist.\n\nThat said, if the main reason you haven\u2019t been to the optometrist is laziness \u2014 you really don\u2019t need to shell out $102 for the privilege of taking eye exams at home. Especially not when there are cheaper options available. Don\u2019t be like me. Suck it up. Go get your eyes checked out.\n\nREADME", "description": "You should go to your optometrist more than once every twelve years. That\u2019s called being an adult and having good common sense.
