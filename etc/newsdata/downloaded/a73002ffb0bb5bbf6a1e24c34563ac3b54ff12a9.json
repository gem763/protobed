However, police are continuing their investigations to try to find out who ordered the killing, and why.\n\nA free press is the lifeblood of democracy \u2013 journalists must not be silenced Read more\n\nThe Malta government said the prime minister, Joseph Muscat, had appointed retired judge Michael Mallia to preside over the inquiry. He would be assisted by a law professor and a retired forensics expert.\n\nThe government said that the independent review must not prejudice the active criminal investigation. It added that the inquiry should conclude its work within nine months.\n\nMuscat, a frequent target of Caruana Galizia\u2019s writings, has offered a \u20ac1m ($1.1m) reward for information leading to the arrest of those behind her killing.\n\nCaruana Galizia published accusations of corruption, money laundering and influence-peddling by people at the highest levels of Maltese society, all of which they denied.\n\nHer family have repeatedly demanded a public inquiry, saying it was the best hope of uncovering the truth.", "description": "Daphne Caruana Galizia, who wrote a popular anti-corruption blog, was killed by a car bomb outside her home", "authors": ["Reuters In Valletta"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/567e0ffe54930b2a1f74e72075798f482da64cbe/0_284_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7ed7776df7c8d272aeab74006b72c383", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
