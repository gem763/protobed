Robert \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke, for one, just can\u2019t seem to stop himself as he runs for the highest office in the land.\n\nAfter a deadly mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, Mr. O\u2019Rourke was asked whether President Trump can do anything \u201cto make this better.\u201d\n\n\u201cUm, what do you think? You know the s\u2014t he\u2019s been saying,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cHe\u2019s been calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals. I don\u2019t know. Like, members of the press \u2014 what the f\u2014k? It\u2019s these questions that you know the answers to. I mean, connect the dots.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, his campaign put out a T-shirt saying several times that this is f\u2013-d up, with just a single asterisk for where the \u201cu\u201d should be.\n\nTell us how you really feel, Beto.\n\nSen. Cory Booker, New Jersey Democrat, also raged after the shootings, saying, \u201cWe are not going to give thoughts and prayers, which to me is just b\u2013\u2014t. I\u2019m sorry to say it as a man of faith, but I was taught that faith without works is dead.\u201d\n\nHe must have missed the day when his religious teacher said cursing is not so godly.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who once was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, is really into dropping the f-bomb. In a recent interview with a hometown magazine, she said, \u201cIf we\u2019re not helping people, we should go the f\u2014k home.\u201d The story included more profanity from Ms. Gilibrand: two f-bombs, one stated-out \u201cb.s.,\u201d one use of \u201csuck,\u201d one \u201cp\u2013-d off\u201d and a comparatively moderate \u201cwhat the hell is going on?\u201d\n\nIt goes right to the top. Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairman Tom Perez said in April that Mr. Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t give a s\u2014t about health care\u201d and dropped the s-word to refer to Mr. Trump\u2019s budget. His DNC sold a T-shirt using the same word, claiming that Democrats give one about people, with the same single-asterisk elision as Beto\u2019s f-bomb T-shirt.\n\nProbably not a good top to wear to your school\u2019s fun fair.\n\nFar-left Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, a bona fide Trump hater, loves to spout profanities, too. On her first day in Congress, the Michigan Democrat recounted a story in which she said her young son told her, \u201c\u2018Momma, look, you won. Bullies don\u2019t win.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Baby, they don\u2019t, because we\u2019re gonna go in there and we\u2019re gonna impeach the m\u2013\u2013\u2013-r.\u2019\u201d\n\nYou know, your average dinner table talk with your kids.\n\nThe problem has gotten so out of hand that before the Democrats\u2019 last debate earlier this month, the DNC put out a directive to the candidates: Cool it with the profanity.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to take this opportunity to remind you that, as the debate will air on the ABC broadcast network, we are governed by Federal Communications Commission indecency rules,\u201d the DNC wrote in a letter obtained by Axios. \u201cWe will not be broadcasting on any delay, so there will be no opportunity to edit out foul language. Candidates should therefore avoid cursing or expletives in accordance with federal law and FCC guidelines.\u201d\n\nThe fact that you have to tell a bunch of adults to avoid cursing on live TV shows you the extent of Trump derangement syndrome. And that doesn\u2019t even include the rabid (and profane) limousine liberals like Robert DeNiro, Alec Baldwin and Alyssa Milano (she swears like a sailor).\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing about cursing: It makes the user look small and weak. Just like using ad hominem attacks, those who spew profanity always look as if they can\u2019t control themselves, that they\u2019re prone to violent rages and outbursts.\n\nYet the Democrats think that by cursing out Mr. Trump, they look passionate and, yes, angry. They think that shows they are serious about taking him down in 2020, and they see themselves as modern-day prophets simply telling the truth, which, they say, can sometimes be profane.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t. It just further degrades the level of discourse in politics, already at a record low. It\u2019s crass and uncouth, especially when you consider the fact that those using profanity are elected officials, some of whom are seeking the highest office in the land.\n\nAt the next debate, lets hope the DNC chairman simply threatens to wash the mouths of the candidates who swear out with soap.\n\nIt may be a crude solution, but it works.\n\n\u2022 Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times.
