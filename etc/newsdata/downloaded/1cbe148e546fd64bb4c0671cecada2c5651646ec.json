He led the most barbaric terrorist organization on Earth,\" Hannity said on his television show.\n\nTRUMP DESCRIBES AL-BAGHDADI AS 'WHIMPERING AND CRYING' BEFORE DYING IN US OPERATION: 'HE DIED LIKE A COWARD'\n\nThe Post's original headline Sunday described al-Baghdadi as an \"austere religious scholar.\"\n\nThe obituary, written by the paper's National Security reporter Joby Warrick, followed confirmation of al-Baghdadi's death in a U.S. military operation in Syria on Saturday night. It detailed al-Baghdadi\u2019s rise in the terror group and his origins as a \"religious scholar with wireframe glasses.\"\n\nThe Fox News host spoke directly to Post owner Jeff Bezos.\n\n\"Jeff Bezos, your newspaper. Let me educate your oblivious, deranged newspaper. Baghdadi was no scholar. He was a radical Islamic extremist, an evil as S.O.B.,\" Hannity said. \"He got cornered by members of the toughest, greatest military heroes on the face of this Earth and then blew himself up like the coward he is. And Baghdadi is, I'm pretty certain, rotting in hell as we speak.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBefore directing his ire toward other media that he said unfairly covered the terrorist leader's death to hurt President Trump, Hannity noted that the obituary was yet another example of why the American public distrusts the media.\n\n\"For The Washington Post, Jeff Bezos' newspaper, to ever refer to this terrorist scum as an 'austere religious scholar' is sick, ugly, twisted, and exactly why America will never trust these corrupt mainstream media fake news outlets ever again,\" Hannity said.\n\nFox News' Steven Sorace contributed to this report.", "description": "Sean Hannity blasted The Washington Post Monday for its\u00a0controversial obituary for ISIS leader Abu Bakar al-Baghdadi, and called the paper \"deranged.\"", "authors": ["Victor Garcia"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/29/694940094001_6098613705001_6098612291001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
