A really late present.\n\nNow, she\u2019s in a much better place, which is no wonder when she\u2019s got a pile of epic roles to throw herself into. Her next is for The Flight Attendant, based on the Chris Bohjalian novel \u2013 which she turned into a TV adaption FYI \u2013 and starts filming in New York over the coming weeks.\n\n\u2018I feel good because, I\u2019m knee-deep in The Flight Attendant, which I think is smart. I didn\u2019t have time to think about it,\u2019 she told Entertainment Tonight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKaley\u2019s playing Cassandra \u2018Cassie\u2019 Brown, who wakes up in a Dubai hotel room next to a dead body and has absolutely no recollection how it got there. Rather than calling the police, she joins her fellow flight attendants to board a plane home plagued with fear that she may be behind a murder.\n\nIt\u2019s quite the move from Penny Holfstader.\n\n\u2018I found this book two-and-a-half years ago, and I wanted to make it, and I thought the material was great. I had an instinct about it,\u2019 she continued.\n\n\u2018I [also] think it\u2019s really important to start putting our own stamps on things, especially as women, and having our own voice. And I like being the boss. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the bottom line.\u2019\n\nThe Flight Attendant is expected to air on HBO Max in 2020.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
