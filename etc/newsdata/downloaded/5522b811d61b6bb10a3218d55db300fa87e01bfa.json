Adam Schiff (D-CA) said he was \u201csickened\u201d by President Donald Trump\u2019s troop withdrawal in Northern Syria.\n\nMartha Raddatz asked,\u201dStill concerned about the troops coming out?\u201d\n\nSchiff said, \u201cAbsolutely. I think it\u2019s a disastrous mistake to betray the kurds this way. I think it improves the Russian position in the Middle East, something they desperately want. I vehemently disagree with what the president said that the Russians love having us there.\u201d\n\nRaddatz interjected, \u201cNot sure what he was thanking the Russians for.\u201d\n\nSchiff continued, \u201cMore than that, the idea that we would pull our forces away from this vital ally, the Kurds, that we\u2019ve fought with, died by our side, and now we\u2019re sending our troops back in to protect oil? We\u2019ll betray an ally but go back in to protect the oil, that sickens me frankly. I think, as you can see from so many of the troops that have had to pull out and abandon their allies, they\u2019re sickened by the president\u2019s decision as well.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Sunday's broadcast of ABC's \"This Week,\"\u00a0House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep.
