You\u2019ll do whatever it takes to get your child the care he or she needs.\n\nTo do that, maybe you sign up for your employer\u2019s insurance plan, or use a health savings account for your family. Or perhaps your child has serious health needs, and you need a specialized plan to get access to the right physicians.\n\nThat\u2019s fine\u2014it\u2019s your choice. You\u2019re the parent, and you know what your child needs.\n\nBut for 8.9 million low-income children in America, parents aren\u2019t the first decision-makers in health care. For families enrolled in the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, politicians, not parents, choose what coverage is best for the children.\n\nThe program was established in 1997 to help uninsured low-income kids gain coverage. And it\u2019s done a good job enrolling low-income children: The percentage of children who are uninsured has been cut in half in the program\u2019s 20 years.\n\nBut at the end of September, funding expired for the program. Every few years, program funding must be reauthorized, giving Congress a chance to re-evaluate the program.\n\nIf Congress doesn\u2019t act by the end of the year, states will begin to run out of money and may have to cut back their programs. There has been a large push among states to ensure funding continues.\n\nCongress is well aware that this is must-pass legislation. Both the House and Senate currently have bills to refund the program.\n\nUnfortunately, though, refunding is not all that needs to happen to ensure America\u2019s kids get the care they need.\n\nLawmakers should use this 20-year milestone opportunity to provide structural changes to the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program that would improve the range of options that low-income American children have.\n\nWhile the program has reduced \u201cuninsurance\u201d among children, it has had another effect: enrolling kids in a system that keeps them dependent on the state for their health care. The program provides only limited options for engaging in the broader health care market.\n\nThe State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program is unique in that it gives states some flexibility to decide what type of program they\u2019ll run for children. States receive a certain amount of money, and they can use that to provide a variety of different options.\n\nBut in most states, low-income parents are trapped in whatever program their state has chosen to pursue.\n\nIf you happen to live in a state that provides you more options\u2014for example, one of the handful of states that will help you pay private insurance premiums\u2014you\u2019re in luck. You might be able to choose between options for your child.\n\nIf you live in most states, though, you simply won\u2019t have that kind of flexibility.\n\nParental choice is more than just a political catchphrase. The choice could make the difference in getting your child the care he or she needs.\n\nWhile many primary care physicians accept the program\u2019s coverage, there are still gaps. State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program kids are three times as likely as privately insured children to have difficulty getting a referral to a specialist, and they\u2019re more likely to use the emergency room than their privately insured peers.\n\nSay you\u2019re a low-income single parent with three kids and two jobs. You\u2019re probably grateful that the program covers your kids.\n\nBut what happens if your child has a health need that requires a specialist? You might have to make three times as many phone calls as another parent just to get your child the care he or she needs.\n\nOr suppose that you want to pursue alternative health plans for your son or daughter. Maybe you\u2019d rather use a health savings account, or you want to take your child to a doctor that wouldn\u2019t necessarily accept the program\u2019s patients.\n\nUnless your state has a plan that lets you take your Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program dollars there, you\u2019re out of luck.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason that a parent should be forced to choose one option for their child just because the state decided that was best. If Congress is spending money on this program to help families, it should at least ensure that low-income parents have choices.\n\nParents should be able to take the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program money that the state is already spending, and spend it on options like their employer-sponsored plan, a health savings account, or to help pay for a plan that would focus on specialized options for their child\u2019s unique health needs.\n\nIf parents are happy in the state-provided option they have, they should be welcome to use that, too. But they should not be artificially forced to choose a state-run option when there is a plethora of options available to other consumers.\n\nThis fall, Congress should put medical decisions in the hands of parents, not politicians.", "description": "If you\u2019re a parent, you want your child to be healthy.
