(Image: Sony Pictures)\n\nWhen the whole Spider-Man controversy went down, one of the most common jokes was that Marvel should make a Night Monkey movie. After all, the Night Monkey was just Spider-Man in a different costume. No one would ever notice! That makes the below trailer, coincidental or not, even better than it already is.\n\nThe Night Monkey, of course, is the jokey moniker given to Spider-Man as he wore a new suit to protect his identity in Spider-Man: Far From Home.
