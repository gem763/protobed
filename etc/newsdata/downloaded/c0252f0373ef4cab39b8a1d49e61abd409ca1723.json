It Ranks 10th Globally.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nUBS says a variety of economic challenges are likely to limit increases in the cost of housing in Chicago.\n\nFormer Speaker of the House Tip O\u2019Neill\u2019s famous observation that all politics is local applies to real estate as well. That\u2019s clear from trends in residential properties in major cities around the world: Price increases have cooled overall, but costs have continued to soar in some already expensive places.\n\nThe most overpriced markets are in Europe, according to the UBS Global Real Estate Bubble Index, released Monday. Germany leads the list. Munich ranks as the most costly major city based on the bank\u2019s criteria, while Frankfurt, the fifth most richly priced, saw the fastest rate of increases.\n\nToronto and Vancouver were No. 2 and 6, respectively, of the most overpriced cities, which shouldn\u2019t be a surprise given the influx of foreign buyers into Canada. Perennially high-priced Hong Kong came in at No. 3, while Amsterdam and Paris were in fourth and seventh places as cities having the greatest risk of being in a market bubble.\n\nUBS made its determinations by measuring affordability based on house prices relative to both incomes and rents.\n\nOn the former score, in Hong Kong even those who earn twice the average income would struggle to afford a 650-square-foot apartment, the bank found. No mention was made of the recent political unrest, which adds an extra measure of uncertainty to the market.\n\n\u201cHouse prices also have decoupled from local incomes in Paris, London, Singapore, Tokyo, Tel Aviv, and New York,\u201d which typically signals strong foreign investment demand and tight zoning and rent regulations, the bank found. Housing is relatively affordable in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Milan, according to UBS\u2019s scores.\n\nCompared to rents, house prices are most elevated in Zurich, Munich, and Hong Kong, followed by Paris and Singapore. Rental laws are strongly pro-tenant in France, Germany, Switzerland, and Sweden, keeping rents below market levels, the bank says. Price-to-rental ratios are relatively low in U.S. cities, notably San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, and Chicago.\n\nThe inflation in home prices in the highest-priced areas reflects ultralow interest rates, which fan speculative demand, as well as buying interest from foreign investors. That makes prices in these areas most vulnerable to a rise in interest rates, which would also hit investors\u2019 expectations of capital gains, especially in cities where the yield from rental income is low.\n\nTaken from the local perspective, New York housing remains overvalued despite a 10% price decline in real terms since the market\u2019s peak in 2006. In that time, however, rents have jumped 60% after adjusting for inflation, no surprise given the state can boast the Rent is Too Damn High political party.\n\nHousing completions hit a 50-year high in New York last year, while the number of building permits remains elevated as well, UBS also says. It isn\u2019t news that there is a surfeit of new units; the New York Times recently reported that one-fourth of newly built apartments sit vacant.\n\nEven so, a highly skilled worker needs 10 years of income to afford a 650-square-foot flat near the city center, which would presumably including formerly affordable places such as Brooklyn. Meanwhile, demand is being crimped by tax changes, including caps on deductibility of state and local taxes and the introduction of a progressive Mansion Tax.\n\nThe city ranks 19th on the UBS index.\n\nIn San Francisco, ranked 10th, the tech boom boosted real prices by 85% from 2012 to 2018, but UBS says the \u201chousing frenzy is on hold now.\u201d Homes have become unaffordable for many potential buyers and foreign demand is weakening, even as supplies increase. Issuance of building permits has risen to the highest since the late 1980s.\n\nHousing also has cooled in Los Angeles. Homes have become less affordable given that prices have risen 50% in real terms since 2012, even as the region\u2019s exposure to international trade threatens to damage the local economy.\n\nOn the East Coast, Boston also is seeing slower price increases, in line with national averages. The bank still sees the market as relatively affordable and underpinned by strong population growth.\n\nIn Chicago, housing prices remain 25% below their peak in 2006. But, UBS adds, \u201cthe city\u2019s high indebtedness, sluggish employment growth, and declining population will likely continue to hinder significant price increases.\u201d If economic prospects improve, the Windy City market has \u201cpotential substantial upside given good affordability,\u201d it adds.\n\nThat\u2019s a big \u201cif.\u201d\n\nWrite to Randall W.
