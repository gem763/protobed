That title goes to Sweden, where demand for notes and coins is so limp that cash is literally disappearing: the amount in circulation has fallen from 80bn kronor (\u00a36.6bn) to Skr58bn (\u00a34.8bn) in the last four years, a reduction of 27.5pc. The same period has seen ATM withdrawals fall by more than half.\n\nWhat happened overnight\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares were flat, while both Japan's Nikkei gained 0.3pc. Shanghai shares also rose 0.35pc.\n\nUS S&P 500 mini futures traded down 0.2pc, with a big part of early losses cut after the New York Times reported Washington will soon issue licences allowing some US firms to supply non-sensitive goods to China's Huawei.\n\nAnother report, from Bloomberg, that the White House is looking at rolling out a previously agreed currency pact with China also raised hopes of a partial deal and helped to lift assets.\n\nIn Hong, the Hang Seng index has added 0.32pc as investors cautiously await the resumption later in the day of high-level trade talks between China and the United States.\n\nEarlier, US stock futures slumped as much as 1.3pc, as the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported the Chinese delegation, headed by Vice Premier Liu He, was planning to leave Washington after just a day of minister-level meetings, instead of on Friday, as originally planned .\n\nComing up today\n\nTwo announcements worth paying particular attention to today: a trading update from Dunelm, and interim results from Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult not to like Dunelm,\u201d says CMC Markets\u2019 Michael Hewson. Solid results have allowed it to post strong results so far this year, which have been matched by outperformance in its share price. There\u2019s reason to believe \u201cthat the good news may be priced in\u201d, however, says Hewson, so even meeting expectations might lead to a mixed response from investors.\n\n\u201cAs it continues to invest in securing its online position in homeware, there is a risk that profits may well start to flat line, as profit margins shrink,\u201d he says.\n\nInvestment supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s shares have had a tough few sessions of trading \u2013 registering as the FTSE 100\u2019s biggest faller at several points over the past week. The fall followed some critical analyst commentary that said Hargreaves\u2019 core product was struggling to justify its price premium over rivals in a heated sector. Investors will look for reassurance the group\u2019s strategy is paying off in today's results.\n\nInterim results: Hargreaves Lansdown\n\nTrading update: Dunelm, Mondi, Sabre Insurance\n\nEconomics: GDP, RICS house price balance, industrial and manufacturing production, construction output, trade balance (UK), CPI inflation, jobless claims (US)", "description": "Good morning.", "authors": ["Louis Ashworth", "Markets Reporter", "Russell Lynch", "Martin Griffiths", "Ben Marlow", "Ambrose Evans-Pritchard"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2019/10/10/TELEMMGLPICT000212522570-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
