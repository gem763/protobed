He originally sued the city on behalf of his son, who lived in the home with his girlfriend and their young son who were all left homeless after the police raid in 2015.\n\nSWAT teams attempting to capture a man who had stolen several shirts from a Walmart in a neighboring town broke down the doors and walls of the Leches' home after the suspect, Robert Jonathan Seacat, invaded the home. The couple's young son, who was home alone, left the residence while Seacat remained holed up inside with a gun.\n\nSeacat was sentenced in April 2018 to 100 years in prison following numerous charges.\n\nThe damage to the house was so extensive that it was later condemned for demolition by city officials, yet neither the police force nor the city was found liable for the damages.\n\n\u201cThey proceed to destroy the house \u2014 room by room, by room, by room,\u201d Lech told the Post. \u201cThis is one guy with a handgun. This guy was sleeping. This guy was eating. This guy was just hanging out in this house. I mean, they proceeded to blow up the entire house.\u201d\n\nPolice officials defended their actions in 2015 shortly after the incident, stating at the time that \"sometimes\" property is damaged or destroyed during law enforcement actions.\n\n\u201cMy mission is to get that individual out unharmed and make sure my team and everyone else around including the community goes home unharmed,\u201d Greenwood Village police chief Dustin Varney said in 2015, according to NBC news affiliate KUSA. \u201cSometimes that means property gets damaged, and I am sorry for that.\u201d", "description": "A panel of federal appeals court judges has ruled that a Colorado city does not have to reimburse a man after it destroyed his suburban Denver home during a police raid after a suspect holed up inside the house.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/policelinetape11032017getty_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
