At $3.89, the fee rate was equivalent to 4.1724762780401154e-7% \u2014 too small to write sensibly using standard decimals.\n\nAs Bitstamp CEO Nejc Kodrics summarized, the funds \u201ctransferred in a single transaction for the price of a cup of coffee.\u201d\n\n73 million Bitcoin Days Destroyed\n\nWhen the first transaction took place, other commentators noted how easy it was to use Bitcoin for huge wealth transfers without the need for government approval or trusting middlemen.\n\nNonetheless, Bitstamp sending coins to Xapo raised eyebrows for another reason. According to data uploaded to Twitter, the transaction saw 73 million Bitcoin days destroyed (BDD).\n\nThe metric implies the funds involved had not moved for a considerable length of time before exiting the Bitstamp wallet.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported in August, BDD can be used to gauge investor sentiment. At the time, it was suggested that the Bitcoin price itself could be due for another bullish phase.", "description": "Bitstamp sparked two transactions involving almost $2 billion, which attracted total fees of under $200", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMjQxZWQ4ZmQwZGUwZTI2ODU3ZTRiMDhmYzVjMGMyNzcuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
