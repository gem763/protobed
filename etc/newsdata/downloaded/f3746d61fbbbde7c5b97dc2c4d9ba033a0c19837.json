No, he hadn\u2019t called him because he\u2019s a dictator?\u201d\n\nThe author writes that \u201ctwo years later, Donald Trump was still amazed by that conversation. And then he concluded, out loud, to all of us in the room. \u2018Stupid.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe president gave a similar account of the conversation during his most recent Cabinet meeting on Monday.\n\nMr. Trump, after initially engaging in warlike rhetoric with Mr. Kim, met the North Korean for an historic denuclearization summit in June 2018. They held a second summit in February, although Pyongyang has not agreed to give up its weapons program and is still launching short-range missile tests in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.\n\nMr. Wead, who served as an adviser to two presidents as a senior White House staffer, was given exclusive access to Mr. Trump, his family and senior staff for the book, to be published Nov. 26 by Center Street.\n\nThe president\u2019s negotiations with North Korea feature prominently in the book, and disclose the detail that Mr. Kim hates the word \u201chostage.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t use that word,\u201d Mr. Kim said to Mr. Trump when they met alone, according to the author.\n\nMr. Trump got North Korea to release three U.S. hostages in early negotations, and to return comatose college student Otto Warmbier, who died shortly after he was released. He had suffered a severe brain injury during his imprisonment for a minor infraction while visiting North Korea.\n\nPresidential son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner discussed with the author the letters that Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump have written to each other.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a father thing,\u201d Mr. Kushner said. \u201cYou can see from these letters that Kim wants to be friends with Trump, but his father told him never to give up the weapons. That\u2019s his only security. Trump is like a new father figure. So, it is not an easy transition.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
