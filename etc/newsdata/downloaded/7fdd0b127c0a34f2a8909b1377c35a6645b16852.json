Consumers also can ask that businesses delete their information, or opt out of letting it be sold.\n\n\u201cYou have to find a way to capture all that information and track it so you know what\u2019s happening with that information,\u201d said Dan Koslofsky, associate general counsel for privacy and data security at Gap. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a pretty significant undertaking for most companies. Unless you\u2019ve been in a regulated space like health care or financial services, you probably haven\u2019t done that previously.\u201d\n\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act was designed to make data-trafficking companies and tech giants such as Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. \u2019s Google and Facebook Inc. more transparent about how they handle user data.\n\nBut the law, which passed last year and goes into effect Jan. 1, applies to any for-profit business that does business in California and collects data on California residents, as long as its annual revenue tops $25 million, or it holds personal information on at least 50,000 consumers, or it generates at least 50% of its annual revenue from selling user data. Even companies with no physical presence in California but a website that serves Californians are preparing to comply.\n\nPrivacy Push Businesses are racing to comply with California's new privacy law. When companies expect to be compliant Before the January 2020 deadline 52% By the end of 2020 32 Later than 2020 9 7 Unsure / still deciding if the law applies to the company Expected compliance before the January 2020 deadline by industry Financial services 58% Telecom, media, tech 56 Health services 47 Retail, consumer products 46 44 Industrial Other 61\n\nSome 500,000 U.S. businesses across all sorts of industries meet that criteria, according to the International Association of Privacy Professionals. They include companies as varied as Starbucks Corp. and Gap, health insurer Aetna Inc., financial-services firm Wells Fargo & Co., American Airlines Group Inc. and toy maker Mattel Inc. \u2014as well as hundreds of thousands of small and medium-size businesses.\n\nFew companies keep all their customer data in one place, and now many are scrambling to build tools to match up individuals\u2019 data across disparate systems, such as directories, purchase histories and customer-service request logs. Companies also have to review their data-sharing arrangements with vendors and disclose them in their terms of service.\n\nGap had a certain head start because it already brought its European business into compliance with the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which took effect last year and has similar customer-data requirements. To prepare for these laws, Gap\u2019s privacy team interviewed about 200 employees across the company about how they use data.\n\nMany other companies, though, are much further behind. The California law was passed last summer, but many companies delayed preparations during the lengthy amendment process. In a survey PricewaterhouseCoopers conducted last year, only 52% of respondents said they expected their company to be CCPA-compliant by January 2020.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about people falsely accusing us of having information on them when indeed we don\u2019t,\u201d said Jeff Savage, president of the River Cats, Sacramento\u2019s minor league baseball team, which has more than 100,000 people in its email database. \u201cHow do I prove to Joe Smith that I don\u2019t have his info?\u201d\n\nVIDEO Facebook must pay a $5 billion fine after the FTC found the social media company deceived users and improperly managed their personal data. Under the settlement, Facebook is also subject to stricter oversight on how it manages user data. WSJ explains what that means for users.

The law threatens steep damages in the event of a data breach\u2014as high as $7,500 per affected person. Businesses also have to add a \u201cdo not sell my personal information\u201d option to their home page where consumers can opt out.\n\nGiven the difficulty of maintaining a separate protocol for California\u2019s 39.6 million residents, many businesses are choosing to apply the changes they make for California to the rest of the country. Some anticipate that the California law will become a kind of de facto national standard, much like the state\u2019s standards for auto emissions.\n\nRena Mears, a principal with the law firm DLA Piper, said, \u201c99% of the businesses that we\u2019re dealing with are choosing to make the law apply to all their U.S. customers.\u201d\n\nThe requirements\u2019 complexity has created an opportunity for some tech firms. Microsoft Corp. is preparing compliance software, as is LiveRamp Holdings Inc., as well as startups like SECURITI Inc., Text IQ Inc. and BigID Inc.\n\nGap said it doesn\u2019t sell data to brokers but does share customer mailing addresses with catalog companies. The retailer\u2019s privacy team has been scrutinizing those contracts and its disclosures to customers to make sure they comply with the California law.\n\n\u200bThe California Consumer Privacy Act will apply to some 500,000 U.S. businesses across all sorts of industries, including eateries like Starbucks.

Another question is whether a customer who used a credit card in a store but never provided further data would be owed a personal data file. Mr. Koslofsky said Gap wouldn\u2019t store enough data on such a user to be able to identify them and would explain that in response to such a request.\n\nCompanies are gearing up for every conceivable scenario, including the possibility that identity thieves may pose as someone else to obtain their data.\n\nIf consumers in large numbers opt out of data sales, the greatest impact may be on data vendors and digital-advertising companies.\n\nLos Angeles-based Factual Inc. provides location-tracking software for mobile apps, and then sells the users\u2019 location data to advertisers. If a user allows the app to use his or her location but opts out of having the data sold, Factual would still be obligated to provide the service but wouldn\u2019t be able to include that individual\u2019s data in the segments it sells to ad buyers, Factual\u2019s Chief Marketing Officer Brian Czarny said.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Do you think all U.S. consumers should be able to request the data that companies have collected on them and have it deleted? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe California state legislature passed the hastily written law in a deal to block a more ambitious ballot initiative. That left the door open for both industry and privacy groups to spend the past year wrangling over amendments to the law, rather than preparing for it.\n\nThe bills for software and attorneys can creep up.\n\n\u201cAny Fortune 500 company is going to spend at least $1 million on CCPA compliance\u201d in the law\u2019s first year, said Jay Cline, a principal with PricewaterhouseCoopers. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve seen budgets as high as $100 million.\u201d\n\nWrite to Patience Haggin at patience.haggin@wsj.com", "description": "The California Consumer Privacy Act was designed to make tech giants more transparent about how they handle consumer data\u2014and now companies from Starbucks to the Gap also are racing to comply.", "authors": ["Patience Haggin", "Patience.Haggin Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104950/social", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
