Released recently, the survey polled almost 15,000 Australians (over the age of 14) as to how happy they were with their current internet provider. Here are the results.\n\nInternode customers were found to love their telco the most, with an 82% customer satisfaction rating. Stablemates iiNet and TPG were close behind, coming in at 79% and 74% respectively.\n\nFollowing the TPG Group were Optus and Telstra-owned Belong, both at 74%, and Telstra itself at 72%. Last up were Vocus Group-owned iPrimus and Dodo, at 71% and 70% respectively.\n\nImage: Supplied\n\nIf you\u2019re keen to get connected with one of these providers, here's a look at how their unlimited NBN 50 plans compare:\n\nSatisfaction winner Internode is actually your cheapest option here, priced at $59.99 per month on a six-month contract. However, your bill will go up to $79.99 per month after your first six months are over. Internode reports typical evening speeds of 44.4Mbps on NBN 50 plans.\n\nBelong is your cheapest option when you exclude timed discounts. You\u2019ll pay $65 per month, but you\u2019ll have to sign a 12-month contract to get the deal. If you\u2019re interested in changing mobile provider too, Belong will give you $80 of free mobile credit. Belong reports typical evening speeds of 40Mbps on NBN 50 plans.\n\nTPG is up next in terms of pricing at $69.99 per month. This plan is available on an 18-month contract, but you can opt for month-to-month instead if you drop $129.95 in upfront setup fees. TPG reports typical evening speeds of 43.7Mbps on NBN 50 plans.\n\nAnd here's how unlimited NBN 100 plans from each of these providers compare:\n\nBefore we take a closer look, it's worth noting that iPrimus and Dodo don't offer NBN 100 speeds, and Telstra doesn't have an NBN 100 plan in its standard range. If you want 100Mbps on Telstra, you\u2019ll need to sign-up for an NBN 50 plan and buy an NBN 100 speed boost for an extra $30 per month.\n\nTPG is the most affordable out of this group, priced at $89.99 per month with evening speeds of 78.2Mbps. You can nab this plan on an 18-month contract or go month-to-month if you're happy paying $129.95 in setup fees.\n\nInternode is again more expensive than its stablemate, coming in at $99.99 per month, alongside iiNet. Internode only reports evening speeds of 78.6Mbps on NBN 100 plans, which makes it faster than TPG but slower than iiNet. iiNet currently has the best typical evening speeds out of the TPG group, with the telco reporting 83.3Mbps during busy hours.\n\nBoth iiNet and Internode\u2019s plans are available on a six-month contract (which gets you a discounted modem) or a month-to-month term.\n\nAlex Choros is Managing Editor at WhistleOut, Australia's phone and internet comparison website.", "description": "If you're after an NBN plan you'll actually like, you should pay attention to the latest Roy Morgan Internet Service Provider Customer Satisfaction survey.
