[9] Elsewhere in the \u201cHey, eyes up here!\u201d school of attraction science, people in one study tended to look at faces if seeking love, and bodies if motivated by sexual desire. [10] In another study, people tended to check out a romantic prospect\u2019s head and chest\u2014while they focused on the legs and feet of someone in the friend zone. [11]\n\nIf two people can get it together to go out, they are likely to wear red or black, especially common choices on a first date. [12] No wonder: Red makes everyone seem more attractive, both to themselves and to others. [13] What they order matters, too. Researchers have found that a woman is more likely to find a man attractive if she\u2019s eating something that\u2019s spicy rather than sweet. [14] A drink may also help\u2014but only one. In an experiment, people who had the equivalent of a glass of wine were rated more attractive than people who drank either no alcohol or more than a glass, perhaps because they seemed more relaxed, or maybe because they were attractively flushed. [15]\n\nOf course, true hotness lies within, but how do you get someone to discover your inner hottie if you lack come-hither hips or piercing, symmetrical eyes? A red shirt, a glass of wine, and a little curry could be a good start.\n\nThe Studies\n\n[1] Little et al., \u201cSymmetry Is Related to Sexual Dimorphism in Faces\u201d (PLoS ONE, May 2008)\n\n[2] Singh et al., \u201cCross-Cultural Consensus for Waist-Hip Ratio and Women\u2019s Attractiveness\u201d (Evolution and Human Behavior, May 2010)\n\n[3] Burriss et al., \u201cFacial Scarring Enhances Men\u2019s Attractiveness for Short-Term Relationships\u201d (Personality and Individual Differences, Jan. 2009)\n\n[4] Dixson et al., \u201cThe Masculinity Paradox\u201d (Journal of Evolutionary Biology, Aug. 2016)\n\n[5] Mons Bendixen, \u201cEvidence of Systematic Bias in Sexual Over- and Underperception of Naturally Occurring Events\u201d (Evolutionary Psychology, Nov. 2014)\n\n[6] Haselton, \u201cThe Sexual Overperception Bias\u201d (Journal of Research in Personality, Feb. 2003)\n\n[7] Bleske-Rechek et al., \u201cSex Differences in Young Adults\u2019 Attraction to Opposite-Sex Friends\u201d (Evolutionary Psychological Science, Sept. 2016)\n\n[8] Whitchurch et al., \u201c \u2018He loves me, he loves me not \u2026\u2019 \u201d (Psychological Science, Feb. 2011)\n\n[9] Wood and Brumbaugh, \u201cUsing Revealed Mate Preferences to Evaluate Market Force and Differential Preference Explanations for Mate Selection\u201d (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, June 2009)\n\n[10] Bolmont et al., \u201cLove Is in the Gaze\u201d (Psychological Science, July 2014)\n\n[11] Gillath et al., \u201cEye Movements When Looking at Potential Friends and Romantic Partners,\u201d (Archives of Sexual Behavior, 2017)\n\n[12] Kramer and Mulgrew, \u201cDisplaying Red and Black on a First Date\u201d (Evolutionary Psychology, April 2018)\n\n[13] Berthold et al., \u201cThe Effect of Red Color on Perceived Self-Attractiveness\u201d (European Journal of Social Psychology, May 2017)\n\n[14] Miska, \u201cSugar, Spice, and Everything Nice\u201d (Psi Chi, Spring 2018)\n\n[15] Van Den Abbeele et al., \u201cIncreased Facial Attractiveness Following Moderate, but Not High, Alcohol Consumption\u201d (Alcohol and Alcoholism, May/June 2015)\n\nThis article appears in the September 2019 print edition with the headline \u201cLaws of Attraction.\u201d\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
