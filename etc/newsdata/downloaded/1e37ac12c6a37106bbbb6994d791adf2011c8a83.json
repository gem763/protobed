(Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan\u2019s announcement Wednesday that he is instructing attorneys to devise a plan to compensate five wrongly convicted men who collectively spent 120 years in prison could mean the end of a political standoff that had thrown the possibility of such payments into question.\n\nThe state Board of Public Works, which Hogan (R) chairs, is authorized to award money to exonerated prisoners but has not done so since 2004. Hogan has said the board does not have the expertise to decide the size and other details of such payments. He faults the Democratic-majority General Assembly for failing to pass legislation setting compensation standards.\n\nOn Wednesday, under pressure from 50 Democratic lawmakers and attorneys representing the exonerated men, Hogan said he has instructed the Board of Public Works general counsel to work with the state\u2019s chief administrative law judge to \u201cimmediately\u201d devise a process for awarding money to the ex-prisoners. They are seeking about $12 million.\n\nHere are brief profiles of the men:\n\nHubert James Williams: 11 years behind bars\n\n\n\nHubert James Williams was interviewed at the District\u2019s VA Medical Center on July 25. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)\n\nHubert James Williams was sitting on the edge of the bed at VA Medical Center in Northwest Washington, waiting to learn if he would be sent to a rehab facility in West Virginia.\n\n\u201cCould you let us know where you are?\u201d asked Andrew George, his attorney, who until that summer day hadn\u2019t seen his longtime client in several months.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Williams said.\n\nWilliams, 67, is a recovering addict who has struggled with mental illness and had bouts of homelessness since being exonerated. He grew up in Baltimore County and was sexually abused by an older male neighbor, a trauma that his attorneys believe contributed to his substance abuse.\n\nHe started smoking cigarettes at 7 and sniffing glue and gasoline at 10 years old. By 13, Williams was drinking heavily and using speed, acid and quaaludes, according to legal documents. He was honorably discharged from the Navy in 1972 after serving for two years.\n\n\n\nHubert James Williams. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)\n\nAt age 22, Williams killed a friend\u2019s ex-spouse. He was found guilty of second-degree murder and released on parole in 1997.\n\nFive months later, he was accused in the shooting and attempted robbery of a bartender in Baltimore County. He had an alibi, but couldn\u2019t prove it, and was convicted and sentenced to 100 years in prison.\n\nA detective who had worked on the case as a uniformed officer eventually started looking into Williams\u2019s claims of innocence and found witnesses who had lied under oath. The work persuaded prosecutors to push for his release.\n\n\u201cI had to keep saying to myself, \u2018James, it\u2019s okay. James, it\u2019s okay,\u2019 \u201d Williams said this summer of his time behind bars. Twice, he attempted suicide.\n\nHis attorneys petitioned the state for compensation in January 2018. Any money awarded to Williams would be placed in a trust to pay for his care.\n\nThe lawyers have not heard from Williams since he was discharged from the hospital; they worry that he may have returned to living on the streets.\n\nLamar Johnson: 13 years behind bars\n\n\n\n\u201cI felt a little bitter because I was so angry that I lost so much of my life for nothing,\u201d Lamar Johnson said of his wrongful conviction. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)\n\nLamar Johnson said he felt as though all the air left his body when the judge said the words: Life plus 20 years.\n\nTears streamed down his face. He turned to his mother and grandmother, who whispered: \u201cBe strong; everything is going to work out in due time.\u201d\n\nHis \u201cdue time\u201d came 13 years and five months later when he was exonerated for the 2004 murder of Carlos Sawyer on a city corner in East Baltimore.\n\nJohnson spent seven years working with the Mid-Atlantic Innocence Project to prove his innocence. His attorneys found three eyewitnesses who said Johnson wasn\u2019t the gunman, and a witness who said a different man admitted to the crime.\n\n\u201cSome days I felt hopeless because I thought I would never get out,\u201d said Johnson, now 36 and doing maintenance work for Blue Ocean Realty, a company that has worked to help the wrongfully convicted. \u201cBut then I had a little hope because I knew I didn\u2019t do the crime.\u201d\n\n\n\nLamar Johnson sits for a portrait at home in Baltimore in July. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)\n\nWhen he was released, his mother threw a party to celebrate in a three-bedroom apartment in East Baltimore.\n\nWhile everyone was gathered, Johnson found himself crouched on the bathroom floor unable to move. He sat there for 45 minutes.\n\nLater, he said, he realized it was an early indication of the difficult road he would have trying to adjust to his freedom.\n\nWilliams, who now has his own place in Baltimore, avoids crowds because they remind him of the prison mess hall. He often jumps when he hears loud noises, because it brings back memories of prison violence. He\u2019s been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and said no amount of money could compensate him for the lost years and the pain he endured.\n\n\u201cI was basically tortured mentally,\u201d he said. \u201cIt kind of broke me. I\u2019m still suffering. . . I\u2019m happy and thankful that I\u2019m home, but I think I need counseling.\u201d\n\nClarence Shipley Jr.: 27 years behind bars\n\n\n\nClarence Shipley Jr. spent 27 years in prison after he was wrongfully convicted of murder. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)\n\nThe prosecutor offered him 15 years if he would plead guilty in the 1991 killing of Kevin Smith. Clarence Shipley Jr. refused.\n\n\u201cI told them it wasn\u2019t me. The whole time, you know, it wasn\u2019t me, it wasn\u2019t me,\u201d Shipley, now 48, recalled one recent day.\n\nDespite many failed attempts to get his conviction overturned, he always maintained his innocence.\n\n\u201cI had to keep fighting,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to get back to my family. I can\u2019t give up. I didn\u2019t want to die. I was sentenced to die in that prison.\u201d\n\nShipley grew up in South Baltimore and was working at a warehouse as a laborer when he was convicted. His family and friends hired a retired detective to look into his case, which was later determined to be based on faulty witness testimony.\n\nWhile in prison, Shipley mourned the loss of his 12-year-old son, who died in a house fire in 2002. He missed watching his other son grow up. But Clarence Shipley III stood beside his father, with his hand on his shoulder, as he faced television cameras the day he was released.\n\n\n\nClarence Shipley Jr. at home in Baltimore. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)\n\nShipley says he isn\u2019t bitter and holds no ill will against anyone who participated in his incarceration. He says he became a Christian while incarcerated and that his faith in God allowed him to endure.\n\nA family friend helped him get a job transporting drywall for a construction company. Now, he is doing maintenance for Blue Ocean Realty. He lives in Baltimore County with his wife, Jameka, whom he met and married while incarcerated, and his daughter and son. He divides his days among work, family and church.\n\n\u201cI forgave everybody that I wanted to forgive \u2014 the judge, the prosecutors, the eyewitness . . . I forgave them,\u201d Shipley said. \u201cI got to know God for myself . . . He still has his hands on me.\u201d\n\nShipley was freed just days before Christmas last year. Baltimore State\u2019s Attorney Marilyn Mosby (D) apologized to him and wished him a happy holiday.\n\nAsked what compensation from the state would mean, he said, his voice cracking: \u201cNot only would it help me, it would help my family. My family still lives in the projects, still struggling. It would do a lot for me.\u201d\n\nJerome Johnson: 29 years behind bars\n\nJerome Johnson tried 15 times to get the courts to overturn his conviction. Each time he was denied.\n\nTwenty-two years after being convicted, Johnson was on his eighth attorney. Nancy Forster presented new evidence about faulty witness testimony to the Baltimore state\u2019s attorney.\n\nAfter they interviewed numerous witnesses, Johnson was declared innocent.\n\nHe walked out of prison on July 2, 2018, having served 29 years. Two days later, he watched the fireworks at Baltimore\u2019s Inner Harbor to celebrate his freedom.\n\nAccording to his petition for $3.5 million in compensation, Johnson was nearly stabbed to death by fellow inmates in 1990 and 1995. He missed the deaths of his parents and could not actively parent his daughter, who was a newborn when he was arrested at age 20. The two have never formed a bond.\n\nJohnson is also suing the Baltimore City Police Department alleging that police purposely withheld evidence in the 1988 killing of Aaron Taylor.\n\nThrough his attorney, he declined an interview.\n\nWalter Lomax: 39 years behind bars\n\n\n\nWalter Lomax heads a nonprofit called Restorative Justice. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)\n\nWhen 20-year-old Walter Lomax was arrested for murder in 1967, he was naive about the justice system.\n\n\u201cI thought that the system worked, and that, since I had not committed the crime, they would find out the person who did and I would be released,\u201d Lomax wrote in a book of essays about his incarceration.\n\nHe served almost 40 years in prison, the longest of any exoneree in Maryland\u2019s history.\n\nWhen he left for the police station in 1968, \u201cI was thinking, \u2018I\u2019ll be coming back that afternoon,\u2019 \u201d said Lomax, sitting in his office at Restorative Justice, the nonprofit he heads that works on social justice issues.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know it would take nearly 40 years to get back to that point.\u201d\n\nLomax, now 71, spent his early years in Tappahannock, Va., a small town nearly 125 miles from Baltimore. He moved to Maryland with his family at age 10. At 15, he said, he got into some trouble with the law and was charged with robbery and a car theft.\n\nA few years later, he was wrongly charged with the murder of Robert Brewer, a grocery store night manager, after being included in a roundup by police, who were under great pressure to solve crimes in Baltimore City at the time.\n\nLomax was identified in a police lineup, a less than reliable way of identifying a suspect.\n\n\n\nWalter Lomax in his office in Baltimore. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)\n\nWhile in prison, he earned his GED and an associate degree, and served on a state task force that made recommendations for setting up rules for awarding compensation to exonerees.\n\nHe said the panel proposed that the state government use the federal model: $50,000 compensation for each year a person served, with awards made in a timely fashion.\n\nIn their petitions, Lomax and the other exonerees are requesting about $100,000 for each year served, a starting point in negotiations and an amount that some states pay.\n\nIn 2006, a judge ruled that Lomax\u2019s defense lawyer was ineffective \u2014 among other things, the attorney did not offer evidence of arm and foot injuries Lomax had that could have proved his innocence. He was released, with the rest of his sentence erased.\n\nIn 2014, the prosecutor, armed with new evidence of faulty witnesses and official misconduct, signed a writ of innocence, which vacated the charges against Lomax and enabled him to petition for compensation.\n\nLast year, he asked the Board of Public Works for $3.4 million.\n\nHe said it was \u201cunconscionable\u201d for exonerees to experience serving time \u201cand then come out and have to go through this,\u201d again waiting for the justice system to work on their behalf.\n\nRead more:\n\nThey spent 120 years in prison for crimes they didn\u2019t commit.
