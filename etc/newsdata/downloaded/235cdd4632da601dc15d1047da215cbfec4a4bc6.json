The White House's blanket refusal to cooperate suggests that their strategy is to fight the Democrats in court and stonewall the investigation for as long as possible.\n\nHouse chairs have already warned that not complying with requests will be considered evidence of obstruction in a future article of impeachment.\n\nWhat they're saying: The White House argues the president's due process rights have been violated and that the investigation is being carried out in a way that contradicts precedent from previous impeachment inquiries.
