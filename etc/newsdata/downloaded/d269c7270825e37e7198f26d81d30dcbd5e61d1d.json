Who\u2019d have thought it?) when a mild-mannered patient was discovered to be a notorious child killer. Daryl (Rupert Hill) and his daughter Jessie (Adrianna Bertola) were brought to the ED after Jessie almost fell from a cliff and the sight of her blood after he saved her made Daryl faint and crack his head on a railing.\n\nSo far so normal (for Casualty), but the incident was filmed by some local Holby youths and when Robyn (Amanda Henderson) and Jade (Gabriella Leon) watched the footage online and had a look at the comments below it, they were shocked to discover that \u2018Daryl\u2019 was actually Marcus Hopewood, who\u2019d brutally killed a nine year old girl many years earlier \u2013 when he\u2019d been only ten years old himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobyn refused to have anything to do with him because she was so appalled by what he\u2019d done and Lev (Uriel Emil) called him a monster, but the rest of the team continued to do their best for him and put their feelings aside like the professionals they are \u2013 because Marcus had a brain aneurysm that urgently needed treatment.\n\nThe other patient of the week was Lorna (Michelle Collins), who\u2019d been behaving very strangely in the hospital car park. She\u2019d seemed about to stab herself in her car, but when that was interrupted by the phone ringing she got out of the car and shut her hand in the door. She was determined to stay in the ED for as long as possible even though there wasn\u2019t much damage to her hand, and she seemed jumpy and didn\u2019t want her husband knowing where she was.\n\nA killer in their midst (Picture: BBC)\n\nWhat seemed like it might possibly be a story of domestic abuse took a twist when Duffy (Cathy Shipton) discovered that Lorna had also lied about her surname \u2013 because she was the mother of the child Marcus Hopewell had murdered and she wanted revenge. This led to a tense stand off as Lorna held a knife to Jessie\u2019s throat and Duffy pleaded with her not to make Jessie\u2019s mother go through the same pain that Lorna had suffered all of these years. Lorna handed Duffy the knife.\n\nSo what was Duffy doing back in the ED? She\u2019d suffered a horrible episode while out driving where she found herself driving round and round in circles because she\u2019d forgotten how to turn right. Archie (Genesis Lynea) told her that she\u2019d had another TIA, which means she won\u2019t be able to drive for a while. Charlie (Derek Thompson) told David (Jason Durr) that Duffy was already depressed as she\u2019d had to give up her job volunteering in the care home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeeing how beautifully Duffy dealt with Lorna gave David an idea, which Dylan (William Beck) endorsed. Duffy is now going to be volunteering at the hospital, which means we won\u2019t have to go far if we want kindness, understanding and a dollop of Duffy wisdom.\n\nDesperate situation (Picture: BBC)\n\nEthan (George Rainsford), meanwhile, has properly fallen for Effie (Abigail Hardingham). She challenges his conventional, sensible personality by being spontaneous and free-spirited, and he likes it. Unfortunately her father \u2013 and Ethan\u2019s old friend \u2013 Theo (Jim Sturgeon) doesn\u2019t like it, and warned Ethan off in no uncertain terms.\n\nAnd Will (Jack Nolan) finally got the chance to make it up to Archie for not supporting her enough in her arguments with Connie, by helping to magic away some CCTV footage that would have shown her throwing acid over that nasty man\u2019s car a few weeks ago. The price he had to pay for this was to submit to being massaged six times by security guard/trainee masseur Leon.\n\nSue Haasler is the author of the official Holby City book, which you can read about here.
