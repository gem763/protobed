The markets brushed aside trade data and the weekly jobless claims figures on Thursday.\n\nDirection ultimately came from geopolitical risk, which was on the rise once more,\n\nA lack of progress on Brexit, impeachment talks in the U.S and mixed sentiment towards the U.S \u2013 China trade war pinned back U.S Treasury yields.\n\nFreddie Mac Rates\n\nThe weekly average rates for new mortgages as of 26th September were quoted by Freddie Mac to be:\n\n30-year fixed rates decreased by 9 basis points to 3.64% in the week. Rates were down from 4.72% from a year ago. The average fee increased from 0.5 points to 0.6 points.\n\n15-year fixed rates fell by 5 basis points to 3.16% in the week. Rates were down from 4.16% from a year ago. The average fee held steady at 0.5 points.\n\n5-year fixed rates decreased by 11 basis point to 3.38% in the week. Rates were down by 59 basis points from last year\u2019s 3.97%. The average fee remained unchanged at 0.4 points.\n\nAccording to Freddie Mac, the housing market regained momentum with home sales and construction at or near decade highs. Solid sales and price gains are expected to continue into the fall. Both strong labor market conditions and mortgage rate at sub-4% levels will provide support in the months ahead.\n\nIn August, pending home sales rose by 1.6%, reversing most of a 2.5% fall in July, with new home sales surging by 7.1%.\n\nBuilding permits and housing starts had also impressed in August. Building permits jumped by 7.7%, while housing starts surged by 12.3%.\n\nMortgage Bankers\u2019 Association Rates\n\nFor the week ending 20th September, rates were quoted to be:\n\nAverage interest rates for 30-year fixed, backed by the FHA, increased from 3.89% to 3.90%. Points decreased from 0.30 to 0.23 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans.\n\nAverage interest rates for 30-year fixed with conforming loan balances rose from 4.01% to 4.02%. Points increased from 0.37 to 0.38 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans.\n\nAverage 30-year rates for jumbo loan balances decreased from 4.01% to 4.00%. Points slipped from 0.29 to 0.26 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans.\n\nWeekly figures released by the Mortgage Bankers Association showed that the Market Composite Index, which is a measure of mortgage loan application volume, tumbled by 10.1% in the week ending 20th September. In the week ending 13th September, the Market Composite Index had fallen by 0.1%.\n\nThe Refinance Index slid by 15% in the week ending 20th September, leaving the index up by 104% from the previous year. The Index had decreased by 4% in the week ending 13th September.\n\nThe share of refinance mortgage activity decreased from 57.9% to 54.9%, following on from a fall from 60.0% to 57.9% in the week prior.\n\nAccording to the MBA, a fall in U.S Treasury yields drove mortgage rates downwards, with pressure coming from the FOMC\u2019s meeting. Heightened uncertainty over the economic outlook pegged yields back. In spite of falling yields, mortgage rates found support, leading to a 20 basis point rise over the last 2-weeks.\n\nThe MBA also noted that applications decreased as a result of the upward trend in the last 2-weeks. In spite of the downward trend, however, applications were still up by 9% from last year.\n\nFor the week ahead\n\nKey stats include September private sector PMI numbers due out on Tuesday and ADP Nonfarm Employment Change figures due out on Wednesday.\n\nFrom elsewhere, private sector PMI numbers due out of China on Monday will also influence U.S Treasuries.\n\nOn the geopolitical front, trade war chatter, Brexit and impeachment talk will also provide U.S Treasuries with direction.\n\nBarring a disappointing Chicago PMI on Monday, we would expect the numbers to be brushed aside at the start of the week.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "Mortgage rates hit reverse once more as geopolitical risk drove demand for U.S Treasuries.
