Oh my king!\u201d echoed around the Opera Royal at Versailles it was for Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette just before they were dragged off to Paris and their doom by their revolting subjects.\n\nThe piece from \u201cRichard the Lionheart\u201d by Andre Gretry, one of the tragic queen\u2019s favourite composers, was last performed by the Palace of Versailles\u2019 own opera company in 1789, as the ancien regime crumbled.\n\nThis week it returned to the gilded chocolate-box opera, commissioned by the Sun King Louis XIV, after a 230-year break.\n\nThe lavishly decorated theatre was used less than 20 times \u2014 most famously for the festivities that followed Marie-Antoinette\u2019s marriage when she was just 14 \u2014 before she and her husband lost their heads in the French Revolution.\n\nAnd it was the singing of the aria by the king\u2019s bodyguards when the royal couple appeared at a banquet at the opera on October 1, 1789 that lead to their downfall, Versailles\u2019 theatre and events director Laurent Brunner told AFP.\n\nSuch a defiant display of royalist sentiment three months after the fall of Bastille incensed the hungry people of Paris, whose women marched out a few days later to take the royals back to the capital.\n\n\u2013 Scandalous \u2018orgy\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cIt caused a scandal in revolutionary Paris,\u201d said Brunner, with radical leaders like Marat and Danton branding the banquet \u201ccounter-revolutionary\u201d.\n\nRumours circulated \u201cthat the revolutionary tricolour rosette has been trampled underfoot\u201d by the royalist revellers, he added.\n\nThe fake news was further fuelled by revolutionary tracts portraying the banquet as an orgy and claims that the rosette had been turned over to show only the white side, the symbol of the king.\n\n\u201cThree days after (the news broke), the women of Paris marched on Versailles and the day after the palace was empty,\u201d Brunner added.\n\nBy then the three-minute song about Richard the Lionheart, the English king who had also been taken hostage while he was returning from the Crusades, had become a royalist anthem.\n\nIt was quickly banned by the revolutionary government.\n\nEven before the monarchy fell, the comic opera had never been fully performed on the Versailles stage \u2014 which was formally inaugurated on Marie-Antoinette\u2019s wedding day as a gift to the opera-loving teenager.\n\n\u2013 Revolutionary \u2013\n\nShe later built her own little theatre, the Trianon, in the grounds of the palace where she would put on amateur dramatics starring herself and her friends, and stage concerts by her favourite composers like Gretry and Gluck.\n\nHaving hardly hosted another opera from the revolution right up until its restoration in 2009, the theatre is something of an 18th-century time capsule, with machinery to match.\n\nIts design may have been revolutionary in its time \u2014 allowing for the stalls to be removed for balls and banquets \u2014 but today it takes brawn as well as brains to operate.\n\nSix levels above the stage, Carlos Casado hauls the backdrops up and down by hand, one of the last machinists in France to do so.\n\n\u201cIt is quite tough physically,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIt is like working at theatre\u2019s very beginnings.\n\n\u201cThe movements need to be very quick, and a lot depends on \u2018feeling\u2019 so it all goes with the music,\u201d he added.\n\nEven though \u201cRichard the Lionheart\u201d is a story from the Middle Ages, American director Marshall Pynkoski has set the new production in Versailles\u2019 18th-century heydey.\n\n\u201cThere is a real emotion about working here at Versailles,\u201d said Camille Assaf, the wardrobe mistress. \u201cThe atmosphere gets deeply into you,\u201d she told AFP.\n\nShe reproduced costumes \u201cby looking at an awful lot at paintings by Watteau, Fragonard and Boucher\u201d to catch \u201cthe very particular grace\u201d of the period.\n\nThe next production at the Opera Royal will be another nod to the palace\u2019s rich history \u2014 \u201cThe Ghosts of Versailles\u201d, which was created by the New York Metropolitan Opera nearly 40 years ago.\n\nIn it Beaumarchais \u2014 the author of \u201cThe Marriage of Figaro\u201d \u2014 tries to change the course of history so that Marie-Antoinette keeps her head and never has to face \u201cMadame Guillotine\u201d.", "description": "Versailles (France) (AFP) \u2013 The last time the strains of the aria \u201cOh Richard!
