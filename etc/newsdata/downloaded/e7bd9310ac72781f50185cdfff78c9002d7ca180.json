He was setting up his camera in hopes of getting some shots of the northern lights.\n\n\"While I was doing that, I heard kind of a 'boom,' and I actually thought someone set off a firework,\" he said.\n\nWhen he realized it was a meteor, he snapped a photograph. His camera was set to a 10-second exposure, ending up with an image of a streak of light with squiggles on the end.\n\nHe said it flared as it passed overhead, lighting up his yard.\n\n\"It was just kind of neat to see. I don't know how to describe it, other than that it got bright for a bit,\" he said.\n\nThe bright streak was likely a bolide \u2014 a very bright meteor \u2014 or maybe even a super bolide, according to Mike Hankey, operations manager for the American Meteor Society.\n\nBased on the images sent to the society so far, Hankey said it appears to be on the brighter end of the meteor spectrum that ranges from meteor, to fireball, to bolide and super bolide.\n\nWATCH: A dash camera catches a fireball crossing the sky near the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton\n\nA super bolide is \"a bigger object that is brighter than the full moon,\" he said. \"It's actually even brighter than that, almost as bright as the sun. So it explodes at the end of its flight, and oftentimes these events are associated with meteorites, which are rocks that survive from the fireball.\"\n\nHankey set up an event profile for reports that came out of northern Alberta late Saturday. By mid-morning Saturday, the society had received 69 reports, as well as two videos and pictures.\n\n\"This fireball would have been seen for 600 kilometres from either side of it, probably,\" he said.\n\nHe said the more reports and visuals they are able to gather, the better it is for scientists who study meteor activity.\n\nMy Google Nest Cam also caught the meteor over Southeast Edmonton/Sherwood Park tonight.

He said rocks are usually only recovered a few times per year.\n\nThe society has been dedicated to tracking meteors for over 100 years.", "description": "An apparent fireball blazing across the sky was captured by doorbell and dash cameras in the Edmonton region late Saturday.", "authors": ["Paige Parsons Is An Edmonton-Based Reporter", "Web Editor.
