The firm stated that the test comes shortly after a number of social media posts that were critical of the feature. Tesla has claimed that Smart Summon is just one of the first products in a suite of technologies that the firm is marketing as \u201cFull Self-Driving.\u201d\n\nCR\u2018s senior director of Auto Testing Jake Fisher stated that the feature is more of a beta test than a fully working product. \u201cWhat consumers are really getting is the chance to participate in a kind of science experiment,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a work in progress.\u201d\n\nCR\u2018s report states:\n\nBut we found that the system works only intermittently, depending on the car\u2019s reading of the surroundings. The system is designed to work only in private parking lots, but sometimes it seemed confused about where it was. In one case, the system worked in one section of a private lot, but in another part of the lot it mistakenly detected that it was on a public road and shut itself down. At various times, our Model 3 would suddenly stop for no obvious reason. When it did work, the Model 3 appeared to move cautiously, which could be a positive from a safety perspective. But it also meant the vehicle took a long time to reach its driver. The Model 3 also didn\u2019t always stay on its side of the lane in the parking lots. Over several days, CR repeatedly has asked Tesla for comment. CR has called the company and also emailed multiple written questions asking about the Smart Summon technology. The company hasn\u2019t yet returned our calls or responded to our questions.\n\nEthan Douglas, a senior policy analyst at Consumer Reports in Washington, D.C. commented on the feature stating: \u201cTesla once again is promising \u2018full self-driving\u2019 but delivering far less, and now we\u2019re seeing collisions. Tesla should stop beta-testing its cars on the general public by pushing out experimental features before they\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\nCR states in its report:\n\nAsked for comment, NHTSA said it\u2019s aware of the accounts of safety concerns related to Smart Summon. The agency said that it has ongoing contact with the company and that it will continue to gather information. Consumers are encouraged to report any concerns on the NHTSA complaint database, which regulators use to track potential safety defects.\n\nRead the full report from Consumer Reports here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
