A news conference with CEO Derek Jeter was scheduled for Friday.\n\nMattingly\u2019s contract was to expire after this season. He became the Marlins\u2019 manager in 2016 and has guided the team during a rebuilding project under Jeter, who traded away All-Stars Christian Yelich, Giancarlo Stanton, Marcell Ozuna, Dee Gordon and J.T. Realmuto.\n\nWith the roster depleted, the Marlins this season have the worst record in the National League at 53-99, and they\u2019re set to exceed 100 losses for the first time since 1998. But Mattingly has been supportive of the team\u2019s reboot since Jeter\u2019s group bought the franchise two years ago, and the Marlins believe they\u2019re on the verge of a turnaround thanks to an upgraded farm system.\n\nMattingly provides continuing stability for a team that hasn\u2019t had a winning season since 2009 and hasn\u2019t been to the playoffs since 2003. The franchise had seven managers from 2010 to 2015, and Mattingly will be the first Marlins manager to start a fifth season with the team.\n\nHis record in Miami is 272-364 (.428). He managed the Dodgers in 2011-15 and led them to the NL West title three years in a row, and his overall regular season record is 718-727 (.497).\n\nMattingly was hired by previous owner Jeffrey Loria and retained when Jeter\u2019s group bought the team. Mattingly spent his entire 14-year playing career with the Yankees and played first base in Jeter\u2019s debut game in 1995.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Miami Marlins manager Don Mattingly has agreed to a contract extension and will return for a fifth season in 2020, a person familiar with the negotiations said Thursday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steven Wine"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/dolphins_vs_marlins_25730_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
