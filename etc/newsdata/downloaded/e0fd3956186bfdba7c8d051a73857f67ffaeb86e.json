It is a terrible risk that our populations run and it is a very serious matter which must be addressed every day: the counter-espionage and foreign interference issue, however, is something which is ultimately an existential threat to the state.\u201d\n\nWhile terrorist attacks attracted intense public attention, Lewis said, the threat of espionage was often harder to immediately recognise.\n\n\u201cThe harm from acts of espionage may not present for years or even decades ... these sorts of activities are typically quiet, insidious and have a long tail.\u201d\n\nLewis stressed that terrorism remained a threat, and its risk was \u201cunacceptably high\u201d.\n\n\u201cTerrorism has plateaued, it is not increasing, it has plateaued and it is at an unacceptably high level. We have attacks continuing. They are regular and they will continue.\n\n\u201cCounter-espionage and foreign interference \u2026 that is still on a growth trajectory.\u201d\n\nLewis said the while intelligence services were aware of the threat posed by cybercrime and cyberattacks, they were still \u201cgetting a better understanding of the breadth and the depth of the cyber vector to us\u201d.\n\nLewis said foreign interferers \u2013 whether state or non-state actors \u2013 had been facilitated by technological advances.\n\n\u201cCommunities and countries are able to interfere in one another\u2019s business now, because you can,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are conduits through all of those technological advances of globalisation: the internet, instant communication \u2026 social media, that will allow influence to be exerted remotely.\u201d\n\nIn an hour-long presentation, Lewis did not use the word China once \u2013 even when directly invited to by his interlocutors \u2013 but China\u2019s increasing military might and presence across the Asia-Pacific has concerned Australia\u2019s intelligence operatives and politicians, who last month also pledged to crack down on interference in Australian universities.\n\nChina is believed to have been behind a sophisticated hack on the Australian National University\u2019s computer database in 2018. Last month, officials from the Australian Signals Directorate briefed university vice-chancellors on the risk of hackers targeting valuable or sensitive research and personal data.\n\nThe NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption has heard over the past fortnight of a secretive $100,000 donation given to the NSW Labor party in an Aldi shopping bag, allegedly from banned donor Huang Xiangmo, a billionaire Chinese property developer who had his permanent residency cancelled \u2013 effectively banning him from returning to Australia \u2013 after Asio believed he was \u201camenable to conducting acts of foreign interference\u201d and had sought to influence Australian politics on behalf of the Chinese Communist party.\n\nLewis insisted his organisation was trying to find a \u201csweet spot\u201d between passivity and overreaction in responding to security threats, and also to avoid the vilification of minorities, such as Muslim Australians or Chinese-Australians. He said security concerns must not be \u201cunderestimated nor over-egged\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard in public discourse to get ... that sweet spot.\u201d\n\nPolitical rhetoric around actual or perceived Chinese influence in Australia has escalated in recent months.\n\nSuppression and secrecy: how Australia's government put a boot on journalism's throat | Richard Ackland Read more\n\nIn parliament and in a newspaper column, the chair of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, Andrew Hastie, described western complacency about China\u2019s growing global ambition and militarism as akin to the appeasement of Nazi Germany in the lead-up to the second world war.\n\n\u201cLike the French, Australia has failed to see how mobile our authoritarian neighbour has become. Even worse, we ignore the role that ideology plays in China\u2019s actions across the Indo-Pacific region.\u201d\n\nLewis said he had previously spoken to politicians about tempering their rhetoric on minority groups to preserve community relationships.\n\n\u201cYou can very quickly get to the point where you can vilify the many for the actions of the few \u2026 in the counter-espionage and foreign interference space, one needs to be careful that we don\u2019t vilify some of our minority communities here, who are doing wonderful work, and are great Australians,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think getting this balance between zeroing in on those who would wish us harm but at the same time not vilifying the rest of their demographic or their community is very important.\u201d\n\nLewis said Australia remained a \u201crich target\u201d for state-sponsored cyber attacks and suggested that Australia in the future might need to consider giving the Australian Signals Directorate domestic spying powers.\n\n\n\nThe ASD\u2019s powers have come under scrutiny after a newspaper article suggesting the agency\u2019s role could be expanded led to police raids on the home of News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst earlier this year.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is emerging every day, new information about how we are threatened \u2026 by the cyber vector,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cAnd I think that, as we have those discussions, it is necessary to have a look at capabilities such as the Australian Signals Directorate to see whether it can inform, or assist, or be deployed in the extreme in protecting Australians.\u201d\n\nAFP raids have also been conducted on ABC offices and, on Wednesday, on the Canberra home of government official and intelligence officer Cameron Gill.", "description": "Asio boss Duncan Lewis says risk of terrorism \u2018unacceptably high\u2019 but it is not the most serious issue for Australia", "authors": ["Ben Doherty"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9aa27a84222fe586aeaf6fb41c5fe70c10199422/0_127_3834_2301/master/3834.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c87d4c20859bbe7efa7c90861d7d32a2", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
