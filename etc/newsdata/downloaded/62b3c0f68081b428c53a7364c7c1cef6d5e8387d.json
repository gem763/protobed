Sometimes you get beaten, you get out, and you can't be punching walls. As a captain, I've done a lot of work in setting a good example on and off the field over the last 18 months since I took over.

He was disappointed for me,\" said Marsh.\n\n\"Just the feeling of letting your teammates down and not being able to be a part of the journey for the next four to six weeks, that was the point I wanted to stress to the lads, that I was sorry.\"", "description": "Australian cricket star Mitchell Marsh has been labeled an \u201cidiot\u201d by national coach Justin Langer after breaking his hand punching a dressing-room wall during a game.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5da88de085f540205346d64f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
