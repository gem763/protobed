As part of the latest crossover event in Fortnite, Stranger Things-style portals have started appearing in the game\u2019s Mega Mall region. Walk through a portal, and the world will turn dark for a second before you\u2019re transported to another section of the map.\n\nThere\u2019s been no official word on a collaboration between Epic and Netflix, but these kinds of events always start with a tease. Before Marshmello\u2019s in-game concert, for instance, promotional posters started popping up at various in-game locations, and before John Wick made his way into Fortnite, his house mysteriously appeared in the game.\n\nRight now, it\u2019s just Stranger Things portals, but we\u2019ll likely see a deeper collaboration in the form of character skins or a limited time mode very soon. Hopefully, there will be a Demogorgon to fight and an Eggo weapon wrap. You can check out the portals right now. Meanwhile, season 3 of Stranger Things kicks off tomorrow.", "description": "One day before season 3 of Stranger Things debuts on Netflix, portals from the Upside Down have begun to appear in Fortnite, with more crossover events likely coming soon.", "authors": ["Andrew Webster", "Jul"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LlhAgRn31cab41uY1JMKUFh_mTM=/0x38:1920x1043/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18278666/Fortnite_20190703082421.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-03"}
