In theory, this is a prudent move that would translate into the most coverage for the most Americans. But it would be majorly disruptive, so Americans should expect a decade or more of issues before all the kinks are worked out.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was passed nearly a decade ago, and there are still major issues that need to be resolved.\n\nAlso, America\u2019s health care industry represents trillions of dollars in the economy and, according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, \u201chealth care is the fastest-growing sector of the U.S. economy, employing over 18 million workers.\u201d What happens to all those workers when we, rightly, reduce our health care spending and restructure the American health care system?\n\nThere are hundreds of thousands of people working as life and health insurers. What happens to those people if we eliminate private health insurance?\n\nThe sad truth is that inefficiency and inequality can sometimes be employment engines, requiring an ever-growing universe of workers to adjust to a system that doesn\u2019t work as well as it should. Fixing the system can not only eliminate waste in terms of cost, but also in terms of labor. It can be a jobs killer. Progressives should confront this paradox head-on and tell voters how they plan to address it.\n\nAlso, the federal government is a clunky bureaucracy and isn\u2019t always efficient and effective in accomplishing small tasks, let alone large, transformational changes in the American economy and the American culture. It is quite likely that there could be chaos, confusion and disappointments in the short term. Voters should be warned about that by candidates and be prepared for it.\n\nNow, the fact that something is hard doesn\u2019t mean that it shouldn\u2019t be done. But voters should not be sold a fairy tale that sweeping proposals would instantly change everyone\u2019s lives for the better without a hitch.", "description": "Big moves come with hitches.
