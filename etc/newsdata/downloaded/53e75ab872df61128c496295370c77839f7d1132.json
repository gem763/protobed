No new dates or locations have been set.\n\nMoon marked Armed Forces Day at a ceremony at an airbase in the city of Daegu that highlighted four of the eight Lockheed Martin F-35A jets delivered this year. Forty of the aircraft are to be delivered by 2021.\n\nDuring the event, an F-15K jet patrolled over the islands claimed by both South Korea and Japan and called Dokdo in Korea and Takeshima in Japan.\n\nMoon made no direction mention of North Korea or Japan but said today\u2019s security climate was highly unpredictable, requiring strength and innovation.\n\n\u201cAs the recent drone attack in the Middle East region demonstrated to the world, the challenges that we will face will be entirely different from those of the past,\u201d he said in an address to the military. \u201cThe war of the future will be a fight of science and intelligence against all elements that threaten our people\u2019s safety and property.\u201d\n\nAnalysts have said the F-35 stealth jets put North Korea\u2019s anti-aircraft and anti-missile defence systems in a vulnerable position.\n\nNegotiations aimed at dismantling North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programmes have stalled since a second summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un broke down in February over disagreements on denuclearisation.\n\nNorth Korea blamed the United States on Monday for a failure to restart talks, with Pyongyang\u2019s U.N. ambassador Kim Song saying it was time for Washington to share proposals for talks that showed Washington had adopted a new \u201ccalculation method\u201d.\n\nSouth Korea and the United States have separately begun talks for a new military burden-sharing agreement to decide how much South Korea will pay for stationing what is now about 28,500 U.S. troops in the country.\n\nMoon told Trump during a summit in New York last week what South Korea would contribute, including an increase in purchases of U.S. weapons and future purchase plans, a senior official at South Korea\u2019s presidential office said.", "description": "South Korea showcased newly acquired F-35 stealth fighter jets to mark Armed Forces Day on Tuesday as President Moon Jae-in tried to allay concerns that his policy of engagement with North Korea would weaken the South's commitment to defence.", "authors": ["Joyce Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435732463&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF901TO", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
