Kowai (\u6016\u3053\u308f\u3044) or \u201cscary\u201d\n\nWhy is this word on the list? Because there isn\u2019t a person new to Japan who hasn\u2019t committed a linguistic faux pas with kowai, the term for \u201cscary,\u201d and kawaii, the term for \u201ccute.\u201d Semantic mishaps aside, some might argue that this country\u2019s obsession with all things kawaii is downright creepy and kowai, so perhaps it has rightfully earned its place on this list.\n\nNote that interpretations of kawaii and kowai can vary throughout cultures: Overlapping, crooked teeth known as yaeba? Kawaii to some Japanese, startlingly kowai to those who come from countries where perfectly aligned teeth are the norm. That fairy tattoo on your ankle? Grandmas in onsen (hot springs typically don\u2019t allow tattoos) might think you\u2019re kowai, but your friends may think your body art is kawaii.\n\n2. Osoroshii (\u6050\u304a\u305d\u308d\u3057\u3044) or \u201cdevastating\u201d\n\nYou may have heard a form of osoroshii when at a bank, government office or retail store. Staff may tell you: \u201cOsore irimasu,\u201d when responding to a request or inquiry that is just not feasible. In this instance, osore irimasu directly translates to, \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry, but\u2026 \u201d Best used to objectively denote the intensity of a calamity, natural disaster (such as the recent Typhoon Hagibis) or other event; osoroshii denotes something highly destructive or traumatic.\n\n3. Zotto suru (\u305e\u3063\u3068\u3059\u308b) or \u201cto shudder\u201d\n\nFor things that go bump in the night or fill you with suspense and shock, zotto suru is the way to go. Use this for anything from nocturnal screaming to footsteps behind you to the sound of sharpening of knives\u2014any noises of foreshadowing that build suspense before the action even starts.\n\n4. Sesuji ga kooru (\u80cc\u7b4b\u305b\u3059\u3058\u304c\u51cd\u3053\u304a\u308b) or \u201cspine-tingling\u201d\n\nSesuji ga kooru literally means \u201cspine freezing\u201d and it\u2019s not hard to imagine when you\u2019d want to use this phrase\u2014footsteps that follow you on your way home or the creepy feeling you get when you walk past a Japanese school after hours.\n\nAlternatively, you can use chimo kooru to indicate that something is \u201cblood-curdling.\u201d This one may be easy to remember as it is a near-perfect translation of the phrase \u201cfreeze one\u2019s blood.\u201d The particle \u201cmo\u201d is used to indicate \u201ctoo\u201d or \u201cas well,\u201d and something so scary that it freezes both your body and blood? Truly frightening!\n\n5. Kyoufu (\u6050\u6016\u304d\u3087\u3046\u3075) or \u201cfear\u201d\n\nFor a psychological or irrational fear that cuts to the bone, use kyoufu. Add the kanji \u75c7\u3057\u3087\u3046 and you\u2019re well on your way to describing \u6050\u6016\u75c7\u304d\u3087\u3046\u3075\u3057\u3087\u3046 (phobias) in Japanese. Useful whether you\u2019re afraid of the dark, heights, snakes, or scary Japanese food.\n\n6. Guroi (\u3050\u308d\u3044 ) or \u201cdisgusting\u201d\n\nShort for gurotesuku (grotesque), guroi is best used for things that are so unsettling, they\u2019re downright disturbing. From streams of blood and oozing pus to aliens bursting out of a chest to dismemberment (think Tetsuo\u2019s mutation at the end of Akira), this is the word for you.\n\n7. Torihada ga tatsu (\u9ce5\u3068\u308a\u808c\u306f\u3060 \u304c\u7acb\u305f\u3064) or \u201cto get goosebumps\u201d\n\nWhen something is so kowai that the fear physically manifests itself, getting goosebumps is a surefire way to gauge how scared you are. Modern science will tell you that goosebumps are merely an evolutionary reflex held over from when the body hair of early humans stood up to lock in body heat. But, there is something that modern science still can\u2019t explain: if it\u2019s not cold, why do we get goosebumps when we\u2019re scared?\n\n8. Ashi ga sukumu (\u8db3\u3042\u3057\u304c\u7ae6\u3059\u304f\u3080) or \u201cfeet frozen in fear\u201d\n\nFight, flight or freeze in terror\u2014when faced with terrifying events, which option will you choose? People who have felt true fear know all too well that \u201cfrozen feet\u201d is more than a clich\u00e9, it can be paralyzingly real.\n\n9. Kimo wo hiyasu (\u809d\u304d\u3082\u3092\u51b7\u3072\u3084\u3059) or \u201cterrified\u201d\n\nAs an organ with an important function, the kimo (liver) is used in many Japanese idioms to express the gravity or importance of a situation. In this instance, when your liver \u201cfreezes\u201d (hiyasu in Japanese), it means that you\u2019re so afraid that you\u2019re terrified. You don\u2019t have the courage\u2014or guts \u2014to do anything.\n\n10. Imawashii (\u5fcc\u3044\u307e\u308f\u3057\u3044) or \u201cominous\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll conclude this list with a word that succinctly sums up why Japan does horror better than the rest: the masterful storytelling of vengeful spirits hell-bent on inflicting vengeance upon the living. Imawashii often has the underlying meaning of something unfortunate.\n\nNow go forth and be scared (in Japanese!) Happy learning and happy Halloween!\n\nFor more on learning Japanese", "description": "", "authors": ["Teni Wada", "Lucy Dayman", "Randiah Camille Green", "Amelie Marie Nishizawa"], "top_image": "https://gaijinpot.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2017/09/beyond_Kowai-690x460.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
