Add Vaping as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Vaping news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\n\u201cI just remember feeling like absolute...nothing. Like I just couldn't do anything,\u201d Herman, 18, said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t drink water. I couldn\u2019t move. Like, I literally just wanted to crawl out of my skin.\u201d\n\nThe doctors looking after Herman at Los Angeles\u2019 Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center were also stumped. On that day, Aug. 15, a chest X-ray showed white hazy areas at the bottom of her lungs, which her pulmonologist, Dr. Kathryn Melamed, said could potentially be pneumonia. Less than 48 hours later, chest X-rays showed that her lungs were filled with white \u2014 they were inflamed and full of fluid, Melamed said.\n\n\u201cMy best guess since we\u2019re still learning about what is really going on in the lungs is [it\u2019s a] profound inflammatory reaction to the vape products or some...component of the vape products,\u201d Melamed told ABC News' Adrienne Bankert for \"Nightline.\"\n\nStill unable to breathe after two days, Herman had to be put on a ventilator, and shortly afterward, a medically induced coma. It was while she was in the coma that her cousin revealed a secret that Simah had been keeping from her parents that helped lead to some answers.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018You know she smokes every day?\u2019\u201d said Stacy Herman, Simah Herman\u2019s mother. \u201cI said, \u2018What? What are you talking about?\u2019 And she said, \u2018She smokes every day. She smokes that vape.\u2019 I said, \u2018You tell the doctors right now. You go tell the doctors right now.\u2019\u201d\n\nBy the time that Simah Herman had emerged from her coma, she had been in the hospital for five days. With a ventilator still pumping oxygen into her failing lungs, the teen who said she would vape every 10 to 15 minutes decided to become an advocate against vaping.\n\nCourtesy of Stacy Herman\n\n\u201cI asked for, like, a pen and paper because that was the only way I could communicate,\u201d Simah Herman said. \u201cAnd I wrote, \u2018I want to start a no-vaping campaign.\u2019 That was the first thing I did when I opened my eyes.\u201d\n\nSimah Herman\u2019s story is one of the latest in a string of cases of serious \u2014 sometimes even life-threatening \u2014 illnesses linked to vaping.\n\nAs of Sept. 10, there have been six confirmed deaths and over 450 possible cases of lung illness in 33 states associated with e-cigarette products, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which noted that in addition to nicotine, patients also reported using e-cigarette products with liquids containing cannabinoids like THC, the active compound in marijuana.\n\nMany of the cases involve teens. Just last month, 17-year-old Trystan Zohfeld spent 18 days in the hospital after suffering from a vaping-related illness, during which he said he was \u201cthrowing up everywhere.\u201d On Monday night, a Texas high schooler was also rushed to the hospital after vaping.\n\nMelomed is one of countless health officials who fear that vaping-related illnesses are an emerging crisis. Among high school students, there was a 78% increase in e-cigarette use between 2017 and 2018, according to the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) National Youth Tobacco Survey.\n\nSimah Herman said she first started vaping at age 15, and that she\u2019d buy the cartridges from a smoke shop despite being a minor.\n\n\u201cI went in and I was like, \u2018Can I get a pack of Juul pods?\u2019 And they were like, \u2018How old are you?\u2019 And I said, \u201822,\u2019 and they were just like, \u2018OK,\u2019\u201d Simah Herman said.\n\nJust this week, the FDA sent a warning letter to Juul, the industry leader for vape products, accusing it of illegally marketing its nicotine vape products as safer than traditional cigarettes without proof.\n\nIn a statement to ABC News, Juul said it was reviewing the FDA letter and that it would \"fully cooperate.\"\n\nCourtesy of Stacy Herman\n\n\"We share these concerns about youth vaping, which is why we have taken the most aggressive actions of anyone in the industry to combat youth usage,\" Juul said. \"We strongly advocate for Tobacco 21 legislation, we stopped the sale of non-tobacco and non-menthol-based flavored JUULpods to our traditional retail store partners, enhanced our online age-verification process, strengthened our retailer compliance program with over 2,000 secret shopper visits per month and shut down our Facebook and Instagram accounts while working constantly to remove inappropriate social media content generated by others on those platforms.\n\n\"Most recently, we announced the deployment of technology at retail stores that automatically restricts the sale of JUUL products until a government-issued ID is electronically scanned to verify age and ID validity,\" the company continued. \"This technology also limits the amount of JUUL products that can be purchased to prevent reselling or sharing to those underage, and it will soon be mandatory for all JUUL product sales across the country.\"\n\nSimah Herman was healthy and active when she first started vaping. She had been a dancer for years, even making the dance team during her freshman year of college. But she said her abilities started to diminish as her vaping habit increased and she began vaping cannabis as well.\n\nEventually, she was vaping a nicotine cartridge a day, with the total amount of nicotine in one cartridge the same as that in a pack of cigarettes.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think of myself as a smoker. Like, it\u2019s just a different kind of smoke,\u201d Simah Herman said. \u201cThe vaping just makes it seem like nothing. Like you\u2019re doing nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Stacy Herman\n\nIn the two years that she had been vaping, Simah Herman said she lost 50 pounds \u201cwithout trying\u201d because she felt sick all the time. She said she often felt nauseous and dizzy, too, and that she didn\u2019t notice how her appearance had changed.\n\nAs her health issues worsened, she also stopped going to classes. Doctors, meanwhile, weren\u2019t able to offer any solid answers, even though she would tell them that she vaped, she said.\n\n\u201cI told every doctor that I went to just because I had such severe issues,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to make sure that...wasn\u2019t making anything worse, but no doctor ever said, like, \u2018Maybe you should stop vaping.\u2019\u201d\n\nMelamed said there is a lot that\u2019s still unknown about the consequences of vaping. \u201cWe don\u2019t know which components \u2014 if it\u2019s a certain component or certain product [or] certain brand that is responsible for both the short- and long-term effects of vaping,\u201d she said.\n\nABC News\n\nStacy Herman, however, believes the whole industry \u2014 not just Juul \u2014 markets to minors purposely. After she discovered that her daughter was hiding her vape addiction, she said she \u201cransacked her room\u201d and \u201cfound all the vapes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that they market this crap to children, and they turn it into pink, pretty purple packaging [kind of] pisses me off,\u201d Stacy Herman said. \u201cI\u2019m so angry that [Simah] can get a hold of this thinking it\u2019s nothing wrong with it because everyone\u2019s doing it. \u2026 It looks and smells like mango, and it looks and smells like bubblegum and her room smells delicious. I smell[ed] the packages. They smell great.\u201d\n\nAlthough Simah Herman has stopped vaping, she said she still feels compelled to pick one up.\n\n\u201cNow I don\u2019t necessarily crave the nicotine. I don\u2019t necessarily crave the weed. It\u2019s just craving, like, the act of smoking,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that\u2019s been the hardest thing...staying away from it.\u201d\n\nHoping that her story going public will help to discourage e-cigarette use, she said that she\u2019d tell teens who want to try vaping that she once wanted to try it just once, too.\n\nBut then \u201cI tried it another time and then another time. It\u2019s just remembering that you don\u2019t need it. Like, it\u2019s going to kill you.\u201d", "description": "Simah Herman used to vape a nicotine cartridge a day.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/190911_ntl_vaping6_1240_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
