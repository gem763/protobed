Derby\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said Tuesday that Fed rate cuts were necessary to keep the economy on its current path, which remains generally healthy despite some key risks.\n\nThe U.S. economy should grow by around 2.25% this year, which is \"a solid number, as it exceeds my view of the economy's long-run potential growth rate,\" Mr. Evans said in the text of a speech to be delivered in Frankfurt. Mr. Evans expects the jobless rate to stay at a level just under 4% and he sees inflation slowly moving up to the central bank's 2% target over the next several years.\n\nMr. Evans, who is a voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, said that to keep the economy on this path, he had to revise his outlook for rate policy. The Fed has lowered its overnight target-rate range twice this year so far, and Mr. Evans has voted in favor of those actions.\n\n\"Within six months, I went from thinking it appropriate to eventually take policy rates 50 basis points above neutral to one where 50 basis points below neutral was in order,\" Mr. Evans said.\n\n\"This more accommodative stance is needed to support a roughly similar growth outlook to what I had anticipated before and, importantly, to support moving inflation up with greater assurance to achieve our symmetric 2% goal within a reasonable time,\" he said.\n\nMr. Evans noted that the stability in his outlook owes to the fact that the economic fundamentals remain \"solid.\" He added that \"most of the concerns over growth are about potential risks that could be costly, but also may never occur.\"\n\nThe Fed's two rate cuts have been aimed at providing insurance against rising risks from trade uncertainty and slowing global growth. So far, while investment levels and manufacturing activity have slowed, there has been little evidence that the economy is in trouble right now.\n\nWrite to Michael S.
