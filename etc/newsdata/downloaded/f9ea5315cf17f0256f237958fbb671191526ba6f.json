High-beta is a term used in the market to describe assets seen as riskier but potentially offering higher returns.\n\nAround $21.4 billion equivalent of European CoCo debt are callable in 2020, according to BNP Paribas, which means that they probably need to be refinanced.\n\nCoCo bonds were brought in after the 2008 financial crisis to ensure that bond investors as well as shareholders would bear losses if a bank ran into difficulty before any taxpayer cash was needed.\n\nIn 2017, Spain\u2019s Banco Popular shocked its creditors by imposing losses on 1.25 billion euros of CoCo bonds.\n\nLenders such SNS Reaal in the Netherlands, Britain\u2019s Cooperative Bank and Italy\u2019s Monte dei Paschi di Siena have also imposed losses or conversion to equity on other types of bank capital debt.\n\nCHEAP FUNDING\n\nBut banks that come in now will find a much more benign market than last time round.\n\nMarkit\u2019s iBoxx euro CoCo index is at a record high, while the average yield on euro subordinated bank bonds \u2014 which includes CoCo bonds \u2014 is near an all-time low at 0.88%.\n\nAs recently as the start of this year, that average yield was 2.46%, following December\u2019s sharp sell-off in risk assets, and around 1.5% at the time of the Banco Popular CoCo bond writedown in June 2017.\n\n\u201cWe generally think European banks are quite attractive and we see value in capital instruments as many of these names are extremely well-capitalized compared to the crisis years,\u201d said Kaspar Hense, a portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management.\n\n\u201cEven in the event of a recession, we don\u2019t expect too many losses to be triggered (on this debt). Of course, there are risks, which is why we focus on the national champions,\u201d he said, a phrase that describes the biggest and most systematically important banks.\n\n(Graphic: European banks see cost of \"junior\" debt issues plunge, here)", "description": "Banks are set to ramp up their sale of high-risk debt to investors desperate for new ways of bolstering their profits as rock-bottom interest rates hit their portfolios.", "authors": ["Abhinav Ramnarayan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
