We\u2019re seeing more and more signs of progress. I think behaviors are finally changing,\" Walters said.\n\nOf note: Amish don't drive cars and are not permitted by church rules to have driver's licenses, but they pass by billboards while commuting in their traditional horse-drawn buggies. Many are also willing to commute in cars so long as they are not driving.\n\nBetween the lines: While Amish people tend to side with Republican principles like disagreeing with same-sex marriage and abortion, they also, by and large, strongly believe in keeping their community and the federal government separate.\n\nAmish PAC is hoping to reach Mennonite voters as well, who are less traditionalist but still deeply conservative.\n\nBy the numbers: The PAC spent almost $140,000 in 2016 and has already raised $32,000 for 2020, per their campaign finance reports.\n\nIn Lancaster County, where over 10% of all of America's Amish live, 1,019 members of the community voted in 2016. 15,055 were eligible.\n\nAt the end of the 1990s, fewer than 450 members of the community were registered voters.\n\nGo deeper: Trump's 2020 map from hell", "description": "The Amish do not often vote but are heavily conservative.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/FnjsV-CxzfdSIk5GzOWFJmmIzeo=/0x395:3800x2533/1920x1080/2019/10/09/1570651825396.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
