Tuesday he announced to reporters that he will be making some concessions in campaigning after his recent heart attack.\n\nSanders returned to his home in Burlington, Vermont after his release from the hospital following his heart attack. At the time his campaign was busy brushing off questions from the press about the 78-year-old candidate\u2019s health, though it took them three days to acknowledge that it was, in fact, a heart attack that he experienced. During this time of recovery, Team Bernie has been quiet while the inevitable questions begin about the candidate\u2019s ability to continue on.\n\nIt was a bit of a surprise when Bernie admitted Tuesday that he will \u201cchange the nature of the campaign\u201d after a visit to his cardiologist.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to change the nature of the campaign a bit,\u201d Mr. Sanders told reporters after a visit with a local cardiologist. \u201cMake sure that I have the strength to do what I have to do.\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s remarks stood in sharp contrast with comments in recent days from his campaign advisers, who have insisted that the Vermont senator was neither changing course nor easing his trademark intensity as a result of the heart attack.\n\nMonday Sanders told staff that the revolution must go on. He told them that he felt \u201cmore strongly about the need for a political revolution today than I did when I began this campaign.\u201d By Tuesday he was telling reporters that he would be slowing down. It appears that after a visit to his new cardiologist he is ready to admit he has to slow down.\n\nSanders spoke with reporters as he prepared to make his first visit to a cardiologist in Burlington. He admitted he didn\u2019t have a doctor in Burlington because he lives in Washington, D.C., not Vermont. So, he visited a new doctor on Tuesday.\n\nSanders revealed that he never had a doctor in his Vermont hometown, \u201clet alone a cardiologist,\u201d because his primary physician is based in Washington, D.C. \u201cWe\u2019re going to meet him,\u201d Sanders said moments before getting in a car with his wife, Jane, to attend the appointment with his new physician. \u201cI understand he\u2019s a very good cardiologist. Going to see him on a regular basis to get some checkups, and obviously, I\u2019ll be on-and-off in Vermont and so we\u2019re going to meet him today.\u201d\n\nHe admitted he \u201cwas dumb\u201d and didn\u2019t pay attention to physical symptoms in the lead-up to his heart attack.\n\n\u201cI must confess, I was dumb,\u201d the 2020 presidential candidate said outside his home in Burlington, Vt. \u201cThank God, I have a lot of energy during this campaign. I\u2019ve been doing, in some cases, three or four rallies a day, going all over the state, Iowa, New Hampshire, wherever. And yet I, in the last month or two, just was more fatigued than I usually have been.\u201d \u201cI should have listened to those symptoms,\u201d the 78-year-old presidential hopeful said.\n\nThe cardiologist probably told Sanders that a 78-year-old man has no business keeping the campaign schedule that he keeps. Bernie was doing 4 or 5 events a day, often while crisscrossing whatever state he was in. That is enough to take a toll on anyone, much less someone his age. If successful (he won\u2019t be) he would be the oldest person ever elected as president. Sanders says he wants to have the strength he needs to continue campaigning, so he has to cut back. The realization of the seriousness of the state of his health has set in.\n\nBernie\u2019s campaign has hit a rough period. Elizabeth Warren is a viable alternative to Sanders and she younger (70) and by all appearances has tons of energy to see a campaign to the end. Bernie has the advantage of a full war chest, though. He reported raising $25.3 million in the third quarter, the most of any Democrat candidate. He can stay in the race for as long as he wants.\n\nThe health question will stick with him and it\u2019s something he has to be prepared to answer. He plans to participate in this month\u2019s Democrat debate and you know it will come up. Biden will have to answer the same question eventually but for now, the other candidates are busy rallying around Biden, mostly in hopes of securing the vice-presidential slot on a Biden ticket. In the meantime, Elizabeth Warren is rising in the polls and now beats both men according to Real Clear Politics.", "description": "Reality sets in.", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bernie-angry.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
