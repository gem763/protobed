(I can sometimes feel all these things in the space of a few days).\n\n\"I am beyond relieved that more light is being shone on the complexity of going from being a touring artist/ performer to going straight back to normality on a regular basis.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"Thank you to those artists who have spoken so candidly about it lately.\"\n\nThe Burn singer - who married her boyfriend Caspar Jopling this year - went on: \"I know I chose this job but nothing could have prepared me for the ups and downs that come with it.\n\n\"I know for sure that a lot of my anxiety has come from what they call 'imposter syndrome' not believing in myself enough and thinking that I don't deserve happiness which sometimes results in sabotaging your own success.\n\n(Image: Lexie Moreland/WWD/REX/Shutterst)\n\n\"I keep my head straight by training every day (running and boxing mainly) and although it is so hard sometimes to be motivated, the feeling of blood pumping through my veins and a human body performing the way it so impressively does reminds me how cool it is to be alive.\"\n\nGoulding signed off by saying: \"I admire those who get out of bed every morning and seize the day, even when they're not feeling too great. That requires a lot of courage.\n\n\"Please know that you are doing amazingly and I'm proud of you.\"", "description": "The Burn singer told her fans she regrets not speaking to her grandfather as she opened up about her own mental health struggles", "authors": ["Julia Hunt", "Lucy Needham", "Image", "Instagram Getty", "Dave Benett Getty Images For Dav", "Instagram", "Lexie Moreland Wwd Rex Shutterst"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20580494.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_David-Zwirner-Nate-Lowman-x-Frieze-Week-Party.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
