Their per-capita monthly wage here rose 19.9 percent from 2012 to 2017, while in Japan they inched up just 1.3 percent.\n\nIn small businesses, the situation is just the opposite. A worker in a business in Korea with one to four staff earned W1.75 million a month on average, compared to W2.27 million in Japan.\n\nThe wage gap between big and small businesses in Korea was around W3.6 million a month, up to three times higher than the gap in Japan.\n\n", "description": "Korea's Wage Gap Much Bigger Than Japan's", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-04-22"}
