I wanted to feel stronger,' she said.\n\nStevie went above and beyond the recommended training schedule but she was so invested in the process it merely became a daily routine.\n\n'For breakfast I would have a shake with banana, almond milk and protein powder,' she said\n\nHow does the F45 form of training differ from other workouts? F45 Training merges 3 separate leading-edge fitness training styles into one, consummate and compelling group training experience for its members. F45 Training combines elements of High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), Circuit Training, and Functional Training. The fusion of these three training concepts has lead to the development of 31 different, 45 minute workout experiences, with more in development by our F45 Athletics Department. This combination of interval, cardiovascular and strength training has been proven to be the most effective workout method for burning fat and building lean muscle.\n\n'I'd go every morning after the school drop off and again at 5.30pm. Twice a day, for seven days a week, over the course of eight weeks,' she said.\n\nHer favourite classes were those that involved resistance-based training and she would sometimes double up on them, doing both the 5.30pm and 6.30pm classes.\n\n'The biggest challenge was balancing being a mum and working out. I had to tell myself it was only eight weeks. I'd bring my six-year-old to the venues to watch some mornings,' she said.\n\nThe company's quarterly 'challenge' involves completing 4-5 daily workouts which are high intensity in nature and following a meal plan to ensure they're getting enough protein and sustenance (pictured)\n\n'I'd reach for a protein ball or some carrots with peanut butter as a snack,' she said\n\nWhat did Stevie eat?

F45 Nutritionist and Challenge Director, Lyn Green, says, what sets the F45 Challenge apart is 'successfulparticipants, who are everyday people balancing their lifestyles, jobs and family commitments'. Perseverance is the key to success, and this can be made easier by following these top three tips: 1. Eyes on the prize: Focus on your goals as a way to drive fitness momentum and motivate yourself to stick to the nutrition schedule. Many complete the Challenge for their family, health, or to simply live a better lifestyle. 2. Get support: What makes the F45 Challenge truly unique is its strong fitness community, so don\u2019t be afraid to lean on other participants and trainers for support whenever you need. 3. Prepare, prepare, prepare! Preparation is paramount when completing the F45 challenge. Make sure you plan meals, schedule your workouts, and organise the Challenge around your day-to-day activities so it doesn't disrupt other commitments.\n\nThe final two week phase is about entering shock mode and focuses on a high fat, low carbohydrate nutrition plan to strip the remaining body fat, enhance muscle recovery and suppress appetite.\n\nA low intake of carbohydrates encourages fat storage to be used as the energy source instead of glucose. This is known as the 'ultimate fat shredding phase'.\n\nBorn in Australia, the fitness phenomenon has exploded across the globe with over 1,750 franchises sold across 45 countries in just 5 years.\n\nThe next challenge - C24 - will begin on October 14 and be the last one for the year.", "description": "Six men and women have shared the incredible results they achieved in just two months following Australian cult exercise phenomenon F45's eight week challenge.", "authors": ["Matilda Rudd For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/02/19233968-0-image-a-3_1570065790804.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
