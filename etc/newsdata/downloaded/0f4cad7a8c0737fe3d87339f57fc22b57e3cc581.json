It was later reported that the president mentioned Biden in an earlier call with the Chinese president, reportedly promising to stay quiet on the Hong Kong protests as trade talks progressed.\n\nDuring Pillsbury\u2019s Wednesday appearance on Lou Dobbs Tonight, the Trump confidant said he was in Beijing a week ago and that the Chinese are currently looking at this impeachment issue as \u201cthe weakening of President Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey think Nancy Pelosi is a factor in the China trade talks,\u201d Pillsbury added. \u201cIn a way, the Democrats are giving aid and comfort to the enemy. But that will hold the Chinese back from making the kind of concessions President Trump needs.\u201d\n\nPillsbury, who has become an extremely influential figure in Trump\u2019s hawkish China trade policy, went on to express his disappointment that the Chinese are apparently leaving the latest round of trade talks early, once again noting that the impeachment inquiry has really affected their view of the Trump administration.\n\nDobbs, meanwhile, argued that this should show what the \u201cradical Dimms\u201d\u2014Dobbs\u2019 nickname for Democrats\u2014are up to, adding that the \u201cfocus should have been on the relationship between the Democratic Party and its collusion with China.\u201d That prompted Pillsbury to casually make a stunning admission.\n\n\u201cI tried to bring up the topic in Beijing,\u201d he said. \u201cJust tell me what happened with Hunter Biden. I have never seen them get so secretive in my life.\u201d\n\nPillsbury continued: \u201cThey would discuss ICBM warheads rather than talk about what Hunter Biden was doing in China with Vice President Biden. That is a big area now where the Chinese know they don\u2019t want any American probe into what happened with Hunter Biden.\u201d\n\nFollowing Trump publicly urging China to look into the family of a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, several GOP lawmakers joined Democrats in criticizing the president. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) called it a \u201cbig mistake\u201d while Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) said it was \u201cwrong and appalling.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, the Chinese government announced that it had no desire to get involved with a Biden investigation, saying it has \u201clong pursued the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI tried to bring up the topic in Beijing,\u201d he said. \u201cJust tell me what happened with Hunter Biden.
