Still, after his 21-for-22, 396-yard, four-touchdown performance against the Boilermakers, Morgan had the audacity to tell coach P.J. Fleck he has to improve his play.\n\n\u201cBecause I do. There\u2019s a lot of things I need to clean up, a lot of protection calls and pocket movement as well,\u201d said Morgan, the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week. \u201cI\u2019ve just got to be better in a lot of areas.\u201d\n\nMorgan\u2019s yardage total was the seventh-highest in program history, the most by a Gophers quarterback in 10 years since Adam Weber passed for 416 yards in a win at home over Michigan State. Morgan, who took a redshirt in Fleck\u2019s first year at Minnesota and took over as the starter for an injured Zack Annexstad halfway through last season, is 8-2 as a starter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re walking off the field together, and he looks at me and says, \u2018I can be better,\u2019\u201d Fleck said. \u201cI said, \u2018I have to tell you that. You don\u2019t tell me that right after the game. You\u2019re not the one to say that. That\u2019s for Sunday. Let\u2019s celebrate now.\u2019 But that\u2019s the way our players are thinking. They constantly go back to what we can do better. That\u2019s the focus of the program. I know it sounds cliche and coach speak, and it\u2019s not fancy in the media, but that\u2019s how we run the program.\u201d\n\nMorgan and the Gophers (4-0, 1-0) will take on Illinois (2-2, 0-1) on Saturday.\n\nHere are some key angles surrounding the game:\n\nABOUT LAST YEAR\n\nThe Illini racked up 646 total yards last season in a 55-31 victory at home over Minnesota, prompting Fleck to fire defensive coordinator Robb Smith the following day. Reggie Corbin, who\u2019s third in the Big Ten this year in rushing with an average of 104.7 yards per game, ran for a career-high 213 yards in that game on only 13 carries that included a 72-yard touchdown romp on the second snap for Illinois.\n\nAfter Joe Rossi was promoted to replace Smith, the Gophers allowed only 59 points over their final four games, winning three.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something you don\u2019t like to see. But like Rossi always says, there\u2019s nothing that we changed. We still run the same defense. It was just our details went way up and how we practice on defense changed,\u201d senior linebacker Thomas Barber said. \u201cBeing kind of mean guys to the scout teams, tackling harder, being more physical with them, not tagging off, so that\u2019s really one thing he emphasized when he took over.\u201d\n\nCARRIED BY CORBIN\n\nCorbin, the Illinois senior, became the 18th player in program history to reach the 2,000-yard rushing mark. With a robust average of 7.14 yards per carry, Corbin leads the Big Ten and ranks 13th in the FBS.\n\nYOU BETIKU\n\nIllini defensive end Oluwole Betiku Jr., a graduate transfer from USC, leads the FBS with an average of 1.75 sacks per game and 2.6 tackles for loss per game. With seven sacks this season, he\u2019s already equaled or surpassed the Illinois team leader for the season in 18 of the last 23 years.\n\nINTO THE GREAT WIDE OPEN\n\nMinnesota will test a pilot program during homecoming weekend, with recreational vehicles allowed to park overnight Friday and Saturday at a surface lot on the east side of the stadium. It\u2019s sold out. It\u2019s also the latest wrinkle the athletic department has unveiled to try to boost fan interest and game attendance.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football coverage: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The pressure came quickly at Tanner Morgan from two Purdue rushers, with time in the second quarter ticking down toward a minute remaining and Minnesota moving into scoring range.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Campbell"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/illinois_minnesota_preview_football_93074_c0-84-2013-1257_s1770x1032.jpg?4a82c461594f6895c94518d99367af2b1c1b39ad", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
