He is like any teenage boy and embarrasses easily so he just didn't visit the house.\n\n\"He still saw his mum but wouldn't stay overnight because he just couldn't stand the mess.\n\n\"Junior also needed to get to school and Katie not driving meant it was more difficult to get around.\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: mirror.co.uk)\n\nEarlier this month, Katie was slapped with a two-year driving ban after failing to tell police who was behind the wheel of her bright pink Range Rover when it crashed in October last year.\n\nIt's her fourth such ban in two years and means she won't be allowed to drive herself anywhere until late 2021.\n\nKatie has also been told to find thousands of pounds to pay off her spiralling debts in the next six weeks - or she could risk losing the house.\n\nThe former glamour model will face a petition to make her bankrupt when she's hauled back to an insolvency court at the end of November.\n\nMirror Online has contacted Katie and Kieran's reps for comment.", "description": "Katie Price's followers called her out after seeing footage of her son Jett on his dad Kieran Hayler's Instagram - despite her saying she \"loves Sunday mornings\" with her boys", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Instagram", "Mirror.Co.Uk"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19112176.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Katie-Price.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
