This is the right thing to do for the institution and the American people.\"\n\nLast week, Senate Republicans led by Trump ally Lindsey Graham introduced a bill denouncing the House efforts, claiming that the hearings so far make it impossible for Mr Trump to defend himself against the accusations, because they have been conducted in private.\n\nIt is likely that public hearings will come in the next several months, and the new resolution may speed up that process.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump booed at World Series as 'Lock him up!' chants ring out\n\nKey impeachment witness defies subpoena after White House steps in\n\nBolton's testimony in Trump impeachment probe in doubt\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans may relish public impeachment hearings", "description": "The House of Representatives will hold a formal vote this week to open impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump, marking the latest escalation in the process that has threatened his presidency.The measure was announced by House speaker Nancy Pelosi in a letter sent to her fellow Democrats on Monday", "authors": ["Clark Mindock"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9xhdZVovu4TtutHJQAXZGQ--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/4bde1419868add89c5c58e4809940a26", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
