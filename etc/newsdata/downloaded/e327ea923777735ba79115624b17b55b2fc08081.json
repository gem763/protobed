It has helped to save thousands of lives over recent years.\u201d\n\nIn an op-ed published Tuesday in The Washington Post, Will Cathcart, head of WhatsApp, said this attack should serve as \u201ca wake-up call\u201d for tech companies, governments and Internet users.\n\n\u201cTools that enable surveillance into our private lives are being abused, and the proliferation of this technology into the hands of irresponsible companies and governments puts us all at risk,\u201d he said.\n\nCathcart said the attack is proof so-called backdoors should not be created into this type of technology as governments, such as the United States, have requested.\n\nEarly this month, U.S. Attorney General William Barr told Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a letter that he needs to allow law enforcement access to encrypted messages.\n\nCathcart said backdoors present \u201ctoo high a danger.\u201d Democracies, he said, rely on journalists and other members of civil society and this weakening of security makes it easier for entities to gain access to their information.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we will continue to oppose calls from government to weaken end-to-end encryption,\u201d he said.\n\nAmnesty International charged NSO Group with committing human rights abuses with its surveillance technology, demanding Tel Aviv to revoke its export license.\n\n\u201cThese latest revelations underscore that NSO Group continues to profit from its spyware products being used to intimidate, track and punish scores of human rights defenders across the globe,\u201d Amnesty Tech Deputy Director Danna Ingleton said in a statement.", "description": "Oct. 30 (UPI) \u2014 Facebook is suing an Israeli cybersecurity firm, claiming it used the social media giant\u2019s messaging service to spy on human", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
