The conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\n\n\nMarina Koren: Did you watch Elon\u2019s presentation this weekend?\n\nJim Bridestine: I did, yes.\n\nKoren: What did you think?\n\nBridenstine: I thought it was awesome. I think it was inspirational. I like it when contractors get people enthused and inspired about space exploration, and I was inspired myself.\n\nKoren: Why did you post that tweet?\n\nBridenstine: We are working really hard as an agency to get to a day where when we announce a cost and schedule, we can have credibility. Our contractors have to be as committed to that as we are. I was getting a lot of calls from the media about this event, and so we just sent a tweet and said, look, we look forward to this, this is exciting, but at the same time we expect our contractors to be as committed to the programs that the American taxpayer has invested in.\n\nKoren: Both SpaceX and Boeing are behind schedule on Commercial Crew. You told CNN last night that Starliner\u2019s flight is still months away. Why single out SpaceX?\n\nBridenstine: I don\u2019t. I\u2019ve been critical of all contractors that overpromise and underdeliver. We are not singling out anybody.\n\nKoren: After the big presentation on Saturday, a reporter asked Elon to respond to your tweet. Elon said, \u201cDid he say Commercial Crew or SLS?\u201d [SLS stands for the Space Launch System, the NASA capsule and rocket that is meant to deliver astronauts to the moon.] What do you make of that?\n\nBridenstine: Well, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s helpful. Commercial Crew is about getting to low-Earth orbit. We are spending $85 million every time we have to buy a Russian Soyuz seat to get to the International Space Station.\n\nSLS, that\u2019s a whole different mission. SLS is going to the moon. So I don\u2019t know why you would compare the two. But certainly SLS is behind schedule and over cost. We want them to get back on cost and schedule as well. We are holding them accountable just as much as anybody else.\n\nKoren: Have you thought about a future in which private companies leapfrog NASA in the effort to go to the moon?", "description": "A shared effort to deliver NASA astronauts to space recently got a little awkward.", "authors": ["Marina Koren"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/NASA_Dudes/facebook.jpg?1569960027", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
