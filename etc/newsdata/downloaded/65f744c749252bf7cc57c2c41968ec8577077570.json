Companies that offer high value services to the industry without the large capital investments required to build massive growing facilities will garner more investor appeal and higher stock valuations.\n\nThe cannabis extractor space is just the area to watch going into 2020 as the companies become more valuable with Cannabis 2.0 products requiring more specialized capabilities from integrated extraction service providers. The sector is generally focused on bulk oil extracts now, but the move into beverages, edibles, vapes and concentrates will require more complex capabilities and facilities.\n\nThe key here is that while pot has been grown illegally for centuries by various individuals and groups, the market for cannabis extracts is relatively untapped. Companies moving up the value chain should grab higher margins while not having to compete with illegal sources. The extraction of cannabis concentrates is a complex and potentially dangerous process and should only be performed by trained professionals providing a market advantage to the companies with these capabilities.\n\nAny company that can grab market share in this area and establish themselves as a leading provider of high-quality extraction services and product testing will reward shareholders. The future market has the potential to shift towards 75% oil based products according to Cowen Equity Research leaving the companies involved in the extraction and product development process as the potential future market leaders.\n\nWe\u2019ve delved into three small companies poised to profit from the demand for third party cannabis extraction services and the development of high-value add products:\n\nValens GroWorks (VGWCF)\n\nOne of the major players in the cannabis extraction business is Valens GroWorks with contracts with 5 of the top 10 cannabis companies in Canada. The company is building a large extraction facility with a target for 1,000,000 kg of annual throughput while having 240,000 kg in demand from customers for 2020.\n\nThe company recently updated guidance for Q3 to revenues of $16 million to $17 million, up from only $8.8 million in the prior quarter. Valens GroWorks projects extracting 26,000 kg of cannabis and hemp biomass in the quarter ending in August with 50% of the extractions taking place in the last month.\n\nThe company is in the process of moving annual processing capabilities from 425,000 kg of cannabis and hemp biomass to 1,000,000 kg by early 2020. In the process, the company forecasts reaching $218.1 million in 2021 revenues with over $100 million in EBITDA profits.\n\nValens GroWorks generated a solid $2.0 million in EBITDA profits in the last quarter and another quarter of huge profits would push the stock higher in an industry where losses are very common now. The cannabis extraction company has the additional catalyst of listing on a major stock exchange in the future. With a fully diluted share count of 140 million shares, the stock is relatively cheap at a market cap of only $325 million.\n\nThe stock is an incredible value of below 4x EBITDA targets for just a year out from where the market will start looking at 2021 estimates.\n\nOver the last three months, Valens GroWorks stock has received 3 Buy ratings. As a result, the stock has a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 analyst consensus rating. These analysts believe (on average) that the cannabis stock has big upside potential of over 190% from the current share price. This would take Valens from $2.22 all the way to $6.47.
