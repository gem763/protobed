The Johannesburg-based company said it used the period of factory closures to undertake upgrades and train employees.\n\nThe Germiston facility re-opened on October 12. The Enterprise meat canning operation, which is a separate unit on the Polokwane site, resumed production on September 12.\n\nStructural refurbishments have been completed at Polokwane, and the facility is being assessed by local authorities, with full production to commence once it gets the required regulatory approvals.\n\nThe group's shares were trading at R269.55 a share at 10:05 on the JSE, down 0.5% on the day.\n\n* Sign up to Fin24's top news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO FIN24 NEWSLETTER", "description": "Tiger Brands' financial results show that the company has been hammered by tough trading conditions, including the impact of a deadly listeriosis outbreak.", "authors": ["Sibongile Khumalo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7165/75236f6cef9f41699d4fe4f2ff4cbdb4.jpeg", "published_at": "2018-11-22"}
