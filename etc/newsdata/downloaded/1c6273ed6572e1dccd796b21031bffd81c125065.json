Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., added further fuel to the impeachment fire in a Saturday evening tweet where she said the even bigger scandal than the controversy over Biden, Ukraine, and the Trump-Congress whistleblower fight was House Democrats' refusal to impeach Trump.\n\n\"At this point, the bigger national scandal isn't the president's lawbreaking behavior - it is the Democratic Party's refusal to impeach him for it,\" she wrote.\n\nAlthough House Speaker Nancy Pelosi still opposes impeachment, it appears that the controversy is starting to shift the calculus for some Democrats.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a Sunday morning television interview, \"we very well may have crossed the Rubicon here.\u201d\n\n\"If the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit...then [impeachment] might be the only remedy that is co-equal to the evil that this conduct represents,\" he said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nAt this point, the bigger national scandal isn\u2019t the president\u2019s lawbreaking behavior - it is the Democratic Party\u2019s refusal to impeach him for it. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 22, 2019\n\nThe growing controversy surrounds an August whistleblower complaint by a U.S. intelligence community official and ongoing efforts by Democrats to learn more about Trump's contacts with Ukraine. Democrats have demanded access to the whistleblower complaint.\n\nTrump acknowledged he had discussed an investigation into Biden with the Ukrainian president while speaking with reporters en route to a trip to Texas and Ohio on Sunday morning.\n\nTrump said: \"The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption \u2013 all of the corruption taking place \u2013 and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.\"\n\nHe described the call as \"absolutely perfect.\"\n\nMore: What's going on with Biden and Ukraine? And how does it involve the Trump-Congress whistleblower fight?\n\nMore: Trump said he had 'absolutely perfect' call with Ukraine president about political rival Biden\n\nOn Fox News on Sunday morning, congressional Republicans called for investigations of their own and denounced the drive for impeachment as a goal of \"socialists.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" that he wanted the Department of Justice to \"appoint an investigator to look at all things Ukraine\" and what he said the Ukrainian government had done to help Democrats in the 2016 election.\n\nAnd later in the show, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who is the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, accused Ocasio-Cortez of promoting a \"socialist\" agenda of \"one-party control\" of government.\n\n\"The more I think that they\u2019re out there promoting this kind of craziness and silliness, the more that the American people are put off, and the more likely President Trump is re-elected,\u201d Nunes added.\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen, Michael Collins, David Jackson\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: AOC says bigger scandal than Ukraine is Dem's refusal to impeach Trump", "description": "Ocasio-Cortez added further fuel to the impeachment fire by saying the bigger scandal was Democrats' refusal to impeach President Trump.", "authors": ["Nicholas Wu", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0U2vKv4PfKVSDfd.p9m9ew--~B/aD0xNzQ5O3c9Mjg5MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/f35e5faa5ae3d01a5543763856521f9e", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
