And with the new iteration of the brand, Simon Cowell delivers on that promise, saving the once-beloved show from certain doom.\n\nI can\u2019t remember when I stopped watching The X Factor, but it was somewhere between when Rita Ora left the judging panel and Matt Terry released an Ed Sheeran-penned Christmas song as his winner\u2019s single. The show used to be staple viewing, but it lost its grip on the power to engineer genuine stars. Former winners Rak-Su and Louisa Johnson have yet to release their debut albums and were both dropped by their labels.\n\nI tuned in to the first episode of The X Factor: Celebrity out of curiosity more than anything else. What would soft reboot do for the format of a show that hinges on finding the titular star quality of normal, everyday people? Surely this set-up \u2013 the antithesis of what The X Factor used to be all about \u2013 would be the final nail in the coffin for this once-great TV show? Turns out, like Frankenstein himself, Simon Cowell has brought his creation back to life.\n\nThe Love Island supergroup (well, Samira mostly) were one of the most pleasant surprises in the first episode (Picture: PA)\n\nSure, some things you took with a pinch of salt. Like Dermot O\u2019Leary telling us that none of the contestants had done anything like this before, handily forgetting that Samira Mighty is musical theatre trained, Eyal Booker used to be in a pop band and Kevin McHale quite literally sang for a living on Glee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaking the single-room audition and bootcamp stages out also managed to trim some necessary fat and making the contestants audition in a room full of music industry heavyweights added a necessary element of risk into proceedings.\n\nAs for the auditions themselves? They were an actual, genuine pleasure to watch. From the necessary surprises (The Vixen from the Chase going down an octave!) to the middling (Max and Harvey, everyone who wasn\u2019t Samira in the Love Island group) to the horrendous (Cole and Edwards should be receiving a cease and desist letter from Kylie Minogue any day now) and whatever the hell Martin Bashir was doing.\n\nBoys\u2026what were you thinking?! (Picture: Rex)\n\nIt was joyous, entertaining reality TV at its very best. And, really, that\u2019s what The X Factor did best all along \u2013 entertain people.\n\nYou screamed when Alexandra Burke welcomed Beyonce on stage and had the necessary breakdown. You gasped in surprise at Cher Lloyd\u2019s cover of Stay by Shakespeare\u2019s Sister. You tried to hide your second-hand embarrassment whenever Wagner appeared on stage.\n\nBut no matter who you were watching with, or where you were, you were thoroughly entertained.\n\nMartin Bashir brought Big Wagner Energy to The X Factor stage (Picture: ITV)\n\nI don\u2019t know if The X Factor: Celebrity can maintain the momentum that its built up over the coming weeks. There are good signs though; some people will be leaving next week, after the second round of contestants perform which mean that the Live Shows should be quick and snappy, with the number of finalists in the single digits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe X Factor has always struggled, especially in the last few years, with getting to the point. This time around, it looks like there\u2019s no messing around.\n\nAs for the success these hopefuls wish to find after the show is over, I can\u2019t see any of them necessarily having what it takes to be a genuine pop star (apart from Samira \u2013 she should ditch the rest of the Islanders and release a cover of Normani\u2019s Motivation immediately) but that\u2019s really the point of the show, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s all about the work you put in after it.\n\nFrom Bleeding Love to Bad Boys, to Ghost, The X Factor has given us some landmark moments for British pop and if they find the right act with the right amount of potential, the skies the limit. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been, and it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a regular person or a celebrity for it to work.\n\nAll in all, The X Factor: Celebrity turned out to be must-watch television and the best installment of the programme in years.\n\nI\u2019ll definitely be tuning in next week\u2026will you?\n\nThe X Factor: Celebrity returns this Saturday at 8.35pm on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
