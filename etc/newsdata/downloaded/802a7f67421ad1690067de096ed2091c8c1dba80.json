Tony Evers Signs Order Declaring \u2018Indigenous People's Day\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Wisconsin Democrat Gov. Tony Evers signed an executive order declaring the second Monday of October, which is recognized as Columbus Day at the federal level, as \u201cIndigenous People\u2019s Day.\u201d\n\nEvers signed the measure at the Indian Community School in Franklin, Wisconsin, on Tuesday, WISN reported.\n\n\u201cThrough this executive order, we recognize and appreciate our tribal nations and Indigenous people and their resilience, wisdom, and the contributions they make to our state,\u201d Evers said of the signing.\n\n\u201cNative Americans in Wisconsin and throughout our country have suffered unjust treatment\u2014often at the hands of our government\u2014and today is about recognizing that Wisconsin would not be all that it is without Indigenous people,\u201d he continued.\n\nWisconsin houses 11 federally-recognized Native Nations, according to the executive order, which affirms their sovereignty and recognizes the \u201csignificance\u201d of indigenous people in the region.\n\nAlthough the declaration is of importance to the tribes in the area, some people have disagreed with the measure being scheduled on Columbus Day.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s political correctness run amok,\u201d Milwaukee Alderman Bob Donovan said, adding that he thinks Columbus Day should be observed separately.\n\n\u201cI am not at all opposed to recognizing Native Americans, indigenous peoples to the Americas. No problem whatsoever. But I do have a problem when it\u2019s done at the expense of Christopher Columbus and Italians,\u201d Donovan said.\n\nWisconsin is not the first state to enact an executive order recognizing Native Americans on the same day as Columbus Day. Oklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt signed legislation in April recognizing Columbus Day as \u201cNative American Day,\u201d the Hill reported.", "description": "Wisconsin Democrat Gov.
