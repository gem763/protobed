Jeff Bezos dethroned as world\u2019s richest man", "language": "en", "text": "Plunging Amazon stock has cost its founder Jeff Bezos a fortune in a single day and stripped him of the title of the world\u2019s wealthiest person, giving Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates the top spot.\n\nShares of the world\u2019s biggest online retailer were down around 9 percent to $1,624 during after-hours trading on Thursday as Amazon reported disappointing third-quarter earnings, spooking investors. Despite increased sales, both Amazon\u2019s operating and net income decreased by $500 million and $800 million respectively, the company revealed.\n\nThe tumbling stock reportedly cost Bezos $6.9 billion. The losses brought Bezos' fortune, already knocked down by costly divorce with MacKenzie Bezos, down to $103.9 billion, putting him behind Gates, whose net worth is $105.7 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nAlso on rt.com It\u2019s not just Amazon: These profitable US corporations paid ZERO taxes\n\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg\u2019s calculations showed that at Thursday\u2019s lows, the head of the ecommerce behemoth would have a net worth of $102.8 billion, $5 billion less than Gates.\n\nHowever, Bloomberg Billionaires Index still puts Bezos ahead of Gates because it won\u2019t be updated until after the markets close on Friday.\n\nAmazon stock rebounded slightly to around $1.670 per share during pre-market trading on Friday, but is trading 6 percent below Thursday's close of $1,780.78.\n\nFor more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section", "description": "Jeff Bezos dethroned as world\u2019s richest man after Amazon stock tumbles", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5db2e65a85f5402a6e1ff234.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
