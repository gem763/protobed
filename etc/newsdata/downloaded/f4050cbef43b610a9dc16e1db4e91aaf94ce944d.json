Here are 5 things to know about Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. USA TODAY\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard on Monday said she plans to attend the October debate after she considered boycotting what she claimed was \"a serious threat to our democracy\" by the Democratic National Committee and the media.\n\nThe Hawaii representative said last week, without evidence, that the DNC and corporate media were trying to \"hijack the election.\" She said she might sit out of Tuesday night's debate.\n\nIn the past, Gabbard has criticized the DNC for its debate qualification criteria, including the fact that it only recognizes certain pollsters as counting toward the minimum polling threshold. Gabbard, who did not qualify for the September debate, said other reputable pollsters are left out.\n\nMore: What you need to know about the 4th Democratic debate\n\nFor October, candidates needed to reach 2% in at least four recognized polls and receive donations from at least 130,000 individuals. Twelve candidates qualified to take the stage.\n\nAccording to RealClearPolitics' aggregated data, Gabbard is at an average of 0.7% in polls.\n\nI am seriously considering boycotting October 15 debate to bring attention to DNC/corporate media\u2019s effort to rig 2020 primary.

The Times is a co-host of Tuesday's debate along with CNN.\n\n\"As if to prove my point, NYT just published a 'greatest hits' smear piece. All your favorite hits in one article! These are the folks who will be acting as the 'neutral' questioners/moderators of Tuesday\u2019s debate lol,\" she said on Twitter.\n\nMore: The DNC again raises the requirements needed to qualify for the November debates\n\n2020 candidate and author Marianne Williamson expressed support for Gabbard's stance, saying \"I have great respect for Tulsi for saying such inconvenient truth. She is absolutely correct.\"\n\nContributing: Rebecca Morin\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/14/dem-debate-tulsi-gabbard-attend-after-considering-protest/3973563002/", "description": "Tulsi Gabbard said last week she was considering a boycott because she thinks the DNC and media are trying to \"hijack the election.\"", "authors": ["Jeanine Santucci", "Published A.M.
