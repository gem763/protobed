It is like a short story that insouciantly signs off before you\u2019ve quite decided what it means.\n\nGrace Van Patten plays Lilian, a young woman who has amicably, or at any rate affectlessly, broken up with her boyfriend, Nate (Gary Richardson). Her wealthy widower dad is currently upsetting Lilian by disporting himself in Paris with a new French girlfriend and not returning her phone messages. But it is this absentee dad who fixes Lilian up with a temporary place to stay \u2013 at the handsome home of a family friend: the legendary, reclusive novelist Julia Price (Emily Mortimer), the author of a cult classic called Good Posture.\n\nBizarrely, the difficult and prickly Price takes a sort-of shine to Lilian and starts coming into her bedroom and writing messages in Lilian\u2019s private journal while she is out. And then Lilian meets Nate in the street, and, mortified by the fact that he already has a new partner, she says the first status-boosting lie that comes into her head: that she is making a documentary about Julia Price, and now she has to go through with it.\n\nThere is much comedy to be had from the eccentric director of photography that Lilian appoints; he is wittily played by John Early. And Wells has landed droll cameos from literary stars playing themselves, being interviewed on the importance of this (fictional) novelist: Zadie Smith, Jonathan Ames and even a ruminative, vaping Martin Amis. A stylish diversion.\n\n\u2022 Good Posture is released in the UK on 4 October.", "description": "A little fib to her ex-boyfriend upends the life of a privileged young woman in Dolly Wells\u2019s stylish, Brooklyn-set diversion", "authors": ["Peter Bradshaw"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88310e28899d8d675fc10c86e05fd22a17988934/206_86_1248_749/master/1248.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=999c9ee812dd70575c9e4185b7e339ae"}
