An elderly woman had stopped breathing, or was struggling to breathe, in her home. Her son, clearly distressed, called 911. The conversation between the caller and the dispatcher quickly spirals out of control.\n\nBoth parties appear to argue for several minutes over the condition of the woman. The caller, increasingly exasperated, refuses to give straight answers to many of the dispatcher\u2019s questions. The dispatcher, equally frustrated, hangs up with a curt \u201c'kay, b'bye\u201d. Thirteen minutes later paramedics were sent to the home where the woman in question was pronounced dead.\n\n\u201cHe didn't hear that the nurse\u2019s questions were about helping the mother as best as possible,\u201d says Tanya Stivers, a sociologist at the University of California Los Angeles, US. \u201cThe nurse was trying to establish some basic information about the mother. He found her questions antagonistic. Sometimes things that are transparent to one party, the nurse in this case, are not to another.\u201d\n\nAt one point the dispatcher tries to speak to the elderly woman: \u201c[You] can't, she's\u2026 seems like she's incoherent,\u201d says the caller. When asked why she is incoherent, he replies: \u201cHow the hell do I know?\u201d When chastised for cursing he says: \u201cWell I don't care, ya stupid-ass questions you're asking.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou might also like:\n\nThe incident received extensive coverage in the Dallas newspapers and on national TV news at the time. Officials expressed bewilderment as to how an emergency call could have been conducted this way.\n\nThe caller had given enough information \u2013 their address and that there was someone who had stopped breathing \u2013 to elicit a \u201cMarine Corps response\u201d, in the view of the Fire Surgeon for Salt Lake City Fire Department. This maximum response would include the dispatch of an ambulance, fire engine and paramedics.\n\nAfter an investigation, the dispatcher in question was fired.\n\nBut how could an emergency call have gone so wrong? The failings on both parts subtly shows how the way we ask questions can have a big impact on the answers. Choosing certain words over others can help us persuade, win over and even cajole people we are talking to. By looking at similar miscommunications, and drawing on the experience of \u201cexpert talkers\u201d, there are lessons for how we can ensure our own encounters do not end with dire consequences.\n\nKeep talking\n\nWhen dealing with persons in crisis, the strategy for police negotiators is to keep the subject talking. If you examine the recordings of these negotiations, however, you will find that \u201ctalk\u201d should be avoided. Two researchers, Rein Sikveland and Elizabeth Stokoe, collaborated with British police to analyse recordings of conversations between persons in crisis and crisis negotiators. They saw that negotiators often use \u201ctalk\u201d to begin a conversation: \u201cCan we talk about how you are?\u201d But this often gets pushed back by the person in crisis: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to talk\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s not genuine action, man, you\u2019re just talking\u201d.\n\nPersons in crisis resist the request to talk because, as Stokoe points out, cultural idioms encourage us to put little value on \u201ctalk\u201d. After all, \u201ctalk is cheap\u201d and \u201ctalking the talk\u201d is less meaningful than \u201cwalking the walk\u201d. However, a single word substitution could be enough to save a life.\n\nPerhaps because we do not have equivalent cultural idioms, \u201cspeak\u201d seems to work. In real conversations between a negotiator and person in crisis, when the negotiator says \u201cspeak\u201d (\u201cI wanna come down and I wanna speak to you\u2026\u201d) they get their desired response. In some cases, the person in crisis interrupts the negotiator to begin talking. Despite being near-synonyms, one word is loaded with context that makes it ineffective in these scenarios, while the other is free of those associations.\n\nBeing willing\n\nMediators have also found power in words to turn around someone who is disengaged. These professional facilitators might assist in business negotiations, family grievances or disputes between neighbours. They are experts in making sure conversations reach as positive a conclusion as possible. In the UK, for example, all people in child custody disputes must first attempt to reach an agreement through a family mediation service.\n\nUsually, an initial call with a mediator follows a set pattern. After introductions, the mediator explains how their service works. They then ask: \u201cDoes that sound like something you and the other party want to do?\u201d To which the caller might reply: \u201cOh, I\u2019m not sure the other party will ever agree to this, they are very difficult to deal with.\u201d From a position of looking like the conversation might be shut down, the mediators can turn it around with: \u201cOkay, but you would be willing to come in for a preliminary meeting.\u201d \u201cOh of course,\u201d replies the caller, \u201cI was never not willing to try.\u201d\n\nThe caller is probably not too enthused by the prospect of speaking to a mediator, and has shown that they do not really want to go down this route. Often when we do not want to do something we look to blame someone or something else. Here, they have pinned the blame on the other party \u2013 the other parent of the child.\n\nIt is effective for several reasons; it is not a question, it is a statement, and it allows the caller to frame themselves as a good person while not having to backtrack on blaming the other party.\n\nCultural idioms encourage us to put little value on \u201ctalk\u201d\n\nUsually, once one party has agreed to take part in a session, the other party follows, says Jan Coulton, chair of the College of Mediators in the UK. Coulton has been a mediator for almost 30 years, specialising in family mediation since 1998.\n\n\u201cWe look at the way things are put by each party \u2013 the way they describe their problems \u2013 to move from negatives to positives,\u201d says Coulton. \u201cPeople in conflict can be very focused on the negatives. But when you look there are a lot of matters in common, often the children. They love the kids. We hang the pegs on the positives. There may be differences around how things are done. We may do that when we summarise. We do that in a very positive way back to them at the end.\n\nCoulton says the principles for a positive and constructive discussion are framing your conversation in positivity, not to look for immediate resolutions \u2013 often mediation sessions will end with both parties agreeing to come back with alternative solutions to their problem \u2013 and to reach an agreement together.\n\nUnintended consequences\n\nSometimes, the way that an answer to a question is phrased will also lead to unintended consequences.\n\nAnalysis of conversations between doctors and parents talking about the wellbeing of a child reveals they can often look like negotiations, even though they are not intended to be. Very specific behaviours on the part of the parent lead to a significant increase in prescriptions of antibiotics. What sets them apart from a negotiation is that the parents will not explicitly ask for antibiotics. In fact, when questioned before the appointment, they might not even say that they are hoping to receive antibiotics for their child. However, the doctor will often interpret the parents answers as an attempt to get the prescription out of them.\n\n\u201cThey may present it with a name of an illness \u2013 they might say \u2018I\u2019m worried it could be a sinus infection\u2019,\u201d says Stivers, who has studied these conversations between doctors and parents. \u201cAs soon as parents are talking about infection doctors are more likely to think the parent expects antibiotics.\u201d\n\nThe use of medical terms indicated to the doctors that the parents expected antibiotics. But, this wasn't true. Parents\u2019 concerns were for getting the best possible treatment. Stivers describes this interaction as a good example of miscommunication between an expert and layperson. The doctor hears \u201cinfection\u201d and immediately makes the connection with antibiotics. But for parents, that association does not exist.\n\n\u201cI always like to remember that doctors are people before they are doctors,\u201d says Stivers. \u201cWe don\u2019t like to deprive people of what they want, so it is not always about what is medically correct.\u201d\n\nIs there something else?\n\nAs with \u201cspeak\u201d and \u201ctalk\u201d, one word can make all the difference. In one study, physicians in the US were instructed to solicit extra concerns from patients making visits to their practice. One group of physicians were instructed to say \u201cIs there anything else you want to address in the visit today?\u201d and a second group were instructed to say \u201cIs there something else you want to address in the visit today?\u201d. A third group acted as a control and said nothing to solicit further concerns. In doing so, the researchers were able to test the effectiveness of the words \u201cany-\u201c and \u201csome-\u201c when used in open-ended questions.\n\nThe results were quite clear. \u201cAnything\u201d was as effective at soliciting extra concerns as saying nothing at all \u2013 53% of patients mentioned their additional concern. Clearly, some patients did mention other ailments, but much less frequently than those who were asked the \u201csome-\u201c question. In this group, 90% of patients with extra concerns raised them.\n\nConversation analysts, like Loughborough University\u2019s Elizabeth Stokoe, suggest this is because the word \u201cany-\u201c has a closing-down function. It tends to be used as a token gesture. Think about meetings that end with the chair asking \u201cAny other business?\u201d. How often are other issues raised at this point? Perhaps, with one word substitution, we would be more willing to raise extra concerns \u2013 \u201cIs there something else you would like to raise?\n\nThe right question\n\nEmergency service dispatchers are trained to deal with people who are experiencing \u201cthe worst day of their lives,\u201d says Heidi Kevoe-Feldman, an associate professor in the department of communication studies at Northeastern University, in Boston, Massachusetts. Kevoe-Feldman collaborates with dispatchers taking real life emergency calls to find better ways of handling those calls. Callers are often emotional, so their answers might be incoherent. If they are unable to answer the questions, the dispatcher has to think on their feet.\n\nQuestions with \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d answers are very useful for getting information quickly, like whether the person in trouble is breathing. But more subtle questions, such as what colour the person looks, might need further prompting. In this case, a \u201cmenu\u201d of possible answers is required, but it is important that the menu contains at least three options, otherwise it might lead someone towards an inaccurate answer.\n\nTake this exchange from the fateful Dallas call described at the start of this article:\n\nDispatcher: \u201cOkay is this a house or an apartment?\u201d\n\nCaller: \u201cIt\u2026 it is a home\u201d.\n\nThis is a fairly innocuous question to establish whether or not to dispatch paramedics with light stretchers that can be taken up flights of stairs, or more robust stretchers that are only suitable for use in houses. The caller does not know that.\n\nIf they are unable to answer the questions, the dispatcher has to think on their feet\n\n\u201cThe location question is so critical,\u201d says Kevoe-Feldman. \u201cInside, outside, in a basement, in a car, what floor you are on. The help that you get is very dependent on how you answer this question.\u201d\n\nOne of the problems is that callers often misinterpret why they are being asked questions in the first place.\n\n\u201cThere were multiple things where it went wrong with the Dallas call but at the heart of it call takers ask a lot of questions and callers sometimes act like this is gate keeping,\u201d says Stivers. \u201cThey think they need to answer these questions in a certain way to get what they want.\u201d\n\nIt is worth remembering that the Dallas call is not representative of most calls to emergency services. It is also standard practice to tell the caller that an ambulance is on its way as soon as one has been dispatched, to allay fears they are not going to receive help, and then to continue asking further questions to get a greater level of detail.\n\nKevoe-Feldman says that if you want to be an expert talker when speaking to emergency services dispatchers; know your location. The best way to save a life is to say exactly where you are.\n\n--\n\nWilliam Park is @williamhpark on Twitter.\n\n\n\nJoin one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cThe Essential List\u201d.
