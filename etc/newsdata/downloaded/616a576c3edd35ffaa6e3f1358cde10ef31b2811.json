Donald Trump, who wasn\u2019t scheduled to attend the day\u2019s headline event, popped by briefly after it started, then headed to a separate meeting on global violations of religious freedom.\n\nHis quick, ineffectual appearance made plain a hard truth about Trump\u2019s presidency: he has global goals but is unwilling to build broad coalitions to accomplish them.\n\nPrevious Presidents have set the agenda for major international gatherings like the United Nations General Assembly. President Bush used the moment to make his flawed case for invading Iraq. President Obama used the venue to get countries to bring policy initiatives to address climate change and agreements to take in more refugees. Trump will speak to the full body on Tuesday and, a senior administration official said, use the opportunity to highlight the U.S. as \u201ca positive alternative to authoritarianism\u201d and \u201cshowcase the administration\u2019s commitment to upholding democracy and protecting religious freedoms.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Instead, Trump will spend most of his three days in New York meeting one-on-one with other world leaders. \u201cIt\u2019s just not very Trumpian to say, \u201cLet me gather 30 of the world\u2019s leaders together,'\u201d James Carafano, a national security expert at The Heritage Foundation and a former member of the Trump transition team, tells TIME. \u201cTrump\u2019s comfort zone is in the bilateral talks. That\u2019s his sweet spot,\u201d Carafano says.\n\nTrump touts his personal relationships with authoritarian world leaders such as North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un, China\u2019s Xi Jinping and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. But Trump hasn\u2019t marshaled those one-on-one relationships to deliver on his broader policy objectives. Trump wants to force China to use fair trade practices. He wants to bring U.S. troops out of Afghanistan. He wants to pressure Iran to stop its malign activity in the Middle East. Those are all initiatives that Trump could advance using the traditional American convening power to convince other countries to act along with him.\n\n\u201cIn many areas, the things he\u2019s ostensibly said are his priorities in the foreign policy realm have actually been impeded because he\u2019s pursued a unilateral approach,\u201d says Alex Pascal, a national security expert who was a senior policy advisor in the U.S. Mission to the U.N. during the Obama administration. \u201cU.S. standing in the world is a real material asset to U.S. presidents in pursuing policy objectives, and the lack of it hurts America\u2019s ability to advance its interests and values,\u201d says Pascal.\n\nPart of the challenge for Trump, of course, is that not all of his priorities are what the rest of the world wants to talk about right now. There is growing anxiety about the impacts of climate change, but Trump campaigned on rolling back environmental regulations and took the U.S. out of the Paris climate accords. In previous administrations, the U.S. would have been looked to for help stabilizing Europe\u2019s relationship with the UK during Brexit. But Trump hasn\u2019t volunteered to step into that tense standoff, or bring a broader group together to solve it and stabilize markets.\n\n\u201cThere is quite frankly a great deal to be said for the more traditional methods of negotiation,\u201d says Anthony Cordesman, a former intelligence official at the Pentagon who is now the Arleigh A. Burke chair in strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a problem in finding a common strategy in bringing nations together and above all thinking beyond the most immediate threat or the most immediate crisis in trying to achieve a lasting strategic result,\u201d Cordesman says.\n\nTrump has long been skeptical of international institutions. The world order the U.S. helped create after WWII to promote democracy and free markets has also allowed a totalitarian state like China to engage in unfair trade practices while suppressing its citizens at home. But Trump isn\u2019t trying to engage other countries to broadly counter China. In fact, he took the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership which was designed to create a wall of free economies around China and prod Beijing into seeing the economic benefits of fair trade practices.\n\nFor decades there was broad agreement between Republican and Democratic administrations about the general value in touting political and economic models that under pin institutions like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization as a counter to centrally-controlled economies, says Salman Ahmed, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former Obama administration official. The World Trade Organization failed to stop China from dumping cheap materials and stealing intellectual property from American firms, for example. But instead of bringing other nations together to reform the WTO, Trump\u2019s administration has weakened it by acting on its own, Ahmed says, adding: \u201cIn order to get the rules enforced and rally others to that end, or to reform the operational machinery where deficient, you\u2019ve got to be in the game. And if you absent yourself from it, reform isn\u2019t going to happen without U.S. leadership.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "President Trump got the smaller room.
