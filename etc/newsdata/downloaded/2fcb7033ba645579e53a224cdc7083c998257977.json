REUTERS/Francois Lenoir/File Photo\n\nWriting in Italian financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore, Paolo Gentiloni said that while the EU\u2019s deficit and debt rules must not be ignored, they needed to be \u201creviewed and updated\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for countries which have fiscal space to use it, in an overall context of less restrictive budgetary policies,\u201d Gentiloni, due to replace Pierre Moscovici as economic and financial affairs commissioner on Nov. 1, said.\n\nThe former Italian prime minister warned that with the EU economy slowing, \u201cthe risks of a prolonged period of low growth must not be overlooked\u201d and the task of stimulating the economy \u201ccannot be left to monetary policy alone\u201d.\n\nGentiloni will have an important role in scrutinising Italy\u2019s draft 2020 budget which was submitted to the Commission last week.\n\nThe budget plan raises next year\u2019s structural deficit \u2014 which excludes the effect of GDP growth fluctuations \u2014 by 0.1% of gross domestic product, reversing a previous commitment by Rome to lower it by 0.6%.\n\nEU Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told Reuters on Friday that Brussels would ask Italy for \u201cclarifications\u201d over its budget intentions.\n\nHowever, even though the budget seems to flout EU rules, many analysts expect the Commission to take a lenient approach and avoid a prolonged dispute with Rome like the one that broke out last year when Italy had a less EU-friendly government.\n\nGentiloni, who comes from the pro-Europe Democratic Party which now governs with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, said it was crucial that the budget plan comes from a government that has a constructive approach towards the EU.\n\nAmong what he termed new instruments needed help growth and stability, Gentiloni cited an EU-wide unemployment insurance scheme, without going into details.", "description": "The European Union needs looser budgetary policies and an overhaul of its fiscal rulebook, the bloc's designated economics commissioner said in an article published on Sunday.", "authors": ["Gavin Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1443014225&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0H6", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
