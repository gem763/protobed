They do not believe drug testing is appropriate\n\n'Everyone has their own coping mechanisms. You don't know what's going on in every individual's own life,' Brady told The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\n'I'd just get off Centrelink [if I was drug tested], I'm not going to change for anyone. But for other people who solely rely on Centrelink, it would be a struggle.'\n\nMore than 6,500 Youth Allowance or Newstart recipients from the trial areas - which also includes Mandurah in Western Australia and Logan in Queensland - will be asked to provide urine, saliva or hair samples when they apply for welfare if the laws go ahead.\n\nIf recipients tested positive to drugs, it would affect their payments for up to two years.\n\nThey will also be ordered to undergo a secondary drug test within 25 working days of the first positive result.\n\nIf the second test is also a positive, the recipient would then be sent to see a medical professional in order to seek treatment.\n\nMore than 6,500 Youth Allowance or Newstart recipients from the trial areas - which also includes Mandurah in Western Australia and Logan in Queensland - will be asked to provide urine, saliva or hair samples when they apply for welfare if the laws go ahead\n\nUp to $10 million would be set aside to support job seekers who test positive to drug tests more than once.\n\nDepending on the type of test a person is selected for, it will either take place at a local Centrelink centre or a nearby facility.\n\nThe Department of Social Services predicted that 450 people will fail the drug test and subsequently be put on an income management card.\n\nThe card would hold 80 per cent of their Centrelink payment, and stop them from gambling or buying alcohol.", "description": "Drug using Centrelink recipients who will soon be drug-tested claim they're being unfairly singled out.", "authors": ["Alana Mazzoni For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/05/19771848-0-image-a-7_1571199133226.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
