The problem is that these GDP data get revised in subsequent years and we didn\u2019t finally know until June 2009 that the UK entered recession in April 2008.\n\nEarly indicators of recession in 2008 were provided by a series of qualitative confidence surveys of business and consumers; they had all turned down sharply by spring 2008. These surveys have the benefit that they don\u2019t get revised and are very timely. We already have data for August 2019 in some of the surveys and they are all trending down.\n\nBrexit uncertainty pushes UK to brink of recession Read more\n\nThe IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers index (PMI) in July showed manufacturing and construction were already in recession and the services sector was close to it.\n\nThe Bank of England agents produce a set of scores on how businesses are doing on turnover, capacity constraints, employment and investment intentions, all of which have been tumbling for the last three or four months.\n\nHow has Brexit vote affected the UK economy? September verdict Read more\n\nThe European commission\u2019s Economic Sentiment Index (ESI), which covers both consumers and firms has plunged throughout the summer and is at 92.5, slightly above its June 2008 level.\n\nOf particular note are the reports of consumers in that EU survey. In the barometer of what consumers think the general economic situation in the UK will be over the next 12 months, a higher number is better, a lower number is worse. Since 1985 the series average is -12. In August 2019 the series fell to a low of -36; it was -34 in April 2008. Consumers are also expecting a big rise in unemployment.\n\nReading the minutes of the central bank\u2019s monetary policy committee in August, the complacency was palpable. It seems to me the Bank of England has failed to spot the onset of recession, just as it did in 2008. What is it up to now? Yet again, it is fiddling while Rome burns.", "description": "The Bank\u2019s complacency is palpable.
