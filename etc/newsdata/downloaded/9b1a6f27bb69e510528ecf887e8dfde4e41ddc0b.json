She was also head writer on the first two seasons of Lockdown, winning the SAFTA for Best Drama Writer.\n\nBut comedy is her first love: she was head writer on SAFTA-winning sitcoms like Ses'Top La and Abo Mzala, as well as a director on the SAFTA-nominated Thandeka's Diary.\n\n\"Our first two scripted Originals - Tali's Wedding Diary and The Girl From St Agnes - both broke records as the most-watched shows on Showmax ever, so we know our audience is hungry for quality South African series,\" says Candice Fangueiro, head of content at Multichoice's Connected Video, which houses Showmax and DSTV Now.\n\n\"We think they're going to love laughing with Maboneng's Afropunk crowd just as much as they did with Talibabes in Sea Point in Tali's Wedding Diary.\"\n\nNewcomer Laura Lee Mostert plays Martie, and Zandile Lujabe, best known as Palesa in Isidingo plays Amandla.\n\nOther cast include Kiroshan Naidoo, Lebogang Tlokana, Ebenhaezer Dibakwane, and SAFTA nominee Yule Masiteng.\n\n\"Working on Lockdown was evidence for me that MultiChoice is offering shows that are becoming more and more daring, and that our audience is ready,\" says Moeti. \"When I first pitched Woke in Progress to Showmax, it was tamer than it is now because I thought that was what South African platforms wanted. But Showmax has pushed it to go further. So it's because of Showmax that the girls are as liberated as they are now.\"\n\nMoeti co-created Woke in Progress with Emma Lungiswa De Wet, one of the writers on the hit animation Munki and Trunk, which has two million YouTube subscribers. \"In a way she's Martie to my Amandla,\" jokes Moeti.\n\nThe show will premiere on Showmax on Thursday, 12 December.\n\nCompiled by Leandra Engelbrecht.", "description": "Filming for Showmax's second original scripted comedy, 'Woke in Progress' has begun in Johannesburg.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9445/c8b2a03d482c4e22a5b496c254a09a12.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
