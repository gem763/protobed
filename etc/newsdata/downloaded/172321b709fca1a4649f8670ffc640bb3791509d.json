Hoyer threw cold water on the idea of using inherent contempt to force uncooperative Trump administration officials to comply with congressional subpoenas.\n\nThe Maryland Democrat explained that doing so is unnecessary because they are being successful in the courts, which has the power to hold individuals in contempt and ultimately jail them if they refuse.\n\nBy deferring to the courts, Mr. Hoyer argued, Democrats hope to maintain the public image of their impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cBut we made a judgment that we want the American people to understand we are pursuing not arbitrary action, but considered and thoughtful action,\u201d he said.\n\nHouse Democrats have had a string of victories in the courts recently, including a decision last week validating their ability to issue and enforce a subpoena for President Trump\u2019s financial records.\n\nMr. Hoyer\u2019s comments came just a day after key officials from the administration \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper and acting OMB Director Russell Vought \u2014 as well as the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani refused to cooperate with Democrats.\n\nThe No. 2 House Democrat vowed that there would be consequences.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you, Mr. Giuliani will be held accountable to the government, as we will hold every other individual,\u201d Mr. Hoyer said.\n\nLast week, the White House sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warning her that they wouldn\u2019t cooperate with the impeachment probe until she held a full House vote to authorize and establish equal powers for both parties.\n\nHouse Democrats have repeatedly warned that refusing to cooperate would not only serve as more evidence of obstruction of justice \u2014 an impeachable offense \u2014 but also allow them to conclude that the withheld information would corroborate the allegations in the whistleblower report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
