Small regional media companies like Prime are unable to achieve scale independently,\" Mr Audsley said. \"The proposed merger with Seven provides Prime shareholders with opportunity to invest in a scaled media company.\"\n\nThe combination of Seven and Prime will give the merged business a national TV footprint, around 90 per cent of the Australian population, with the potential to drive national revenues into regional Australia. Regional media businesses, including Prime, have been part of a campaign, known as Boomtown, aiming to sell big national advertisers and media agencies on a growing regional population with disposable incomes on par with many metropolitan areas.\n\n\"It gives us a much higher reach in Australia, access to untapped markets, and it's a lower cost base to run the network, Mr Warburton said. We're one of the only countries in the world where everything is reported differently depending on where you live, so for media buyers, we've halved their workload, and we go right to the top of client lists.\"\n\nMr Warburton added that regional news in particular would continue to be in Seven\u2019s \"DNA\".\n\n\"How exactly that looks, I don't know. But we have no intention to be stripping out news bulletins,\" he said. \"Prime 7 runs a very good hour of news. We're by far the largest news in regional Australia, we've got Craig McPherson, and if you judge our actions in 7 News Queensland, we've also put news into market.\"\n\nHe also added that the merger gives Seven the opportunity to better push its broadcast video on demand channels to regional audiences, given that the promotion of Seven's digital content offerings to this audience had so far been more or less non-existent.\n\n\"7plus has not been promoted, I mean, there have been tags on the end of shows, but it's not in the way we would do it. There has been two different digital teams working in different places, now there'll be one, and one strategy,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeven will also net $28 million from the sale of its regional WA radio business Redwave, which includes nine regional stations. As well as the deals on Friday, Seven is working the $40 million sale of Pacific Magazines to German publisher Bauer Media, although a deal is not finalised, and would be subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nSeven\u2019s acquisition of Prime is the first deal to be done which has taken advantage of the removal of the reach rule in 2017. The reach rule previously prevented one TV network from broadcasting to more than 75 per cent of the Australian population.\n\nIt is the second deal since the wider package of media reforms, the first being the merger of Nine and Fairfax Media, which completed in December 2018. Nine owns the Financial Review.\n\nJust over two months since returning to Seven after eight years away from the company, Mr Warburton has been moving quickly in shaking up the Kerry Stokes-controlled business.\n\nSince replacing Tim Worner on August 16, Mr Warburton dramatically changed the executive structure of Seven, reducing his direct reports from 17 to eight, hired the company\u2019s first chief marketing officer in Charlotte Valente, is expecting to announce a new chief digital officer soon and is on the search for a new chief content officer.", "description": "James Warburton has locked in his first two deals as chief executive of Seven West Media, merging with regional affiliate Prime Media and selling Western Australia radio business Red Wave to Southern Cross Austereo.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3757%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_442%2C$y_555/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/168e13668a64bc11575a9ba56343cc56cc3ae013", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
