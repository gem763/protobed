Breaux was inflating a tire when the \u201czipper failure\u201d \u2014 named for a long sidewall rip with protruding metal reinforcement \u2014 occurred. The pressure of the air slammed him backward. Twenty-eight days later, he died of massive internal injuries to his chest and abdomen, State District Judge Michael Clement wrote.\n\nDamages to Breaux, his five children and his wife, were calculated at $6.7 million with just over $480,000 going toward reimbursing the parish for workers\u2019 compensation, Clement added.\n\nState law will return some of that to the family\u2019s share and judicial interest will add at least $1.4 million to the total, New Orleans attorney Danny Meeks, who represented the family, said Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe calculated damages for Breaux himself at more than $1.5 million, including $400,000 for pain and suffering. Despite heavy sedation, surgeon Mark Kappelman testified that Breaux could move, grunt or groan when asked about pain and had to be \u201ckept in restraints to keep him from pulling out the devices to which he had been hooked up,\u201d the judge wrote.\n\nBreaux\u2019s wife, Irene Breaux, was awarded $1.5 million, including $1 million for mental anguish, grief and anxiety. Their three children were awarded $750,000 to $800,000 each, and Breaux\u2019s adult daughters by his first wife $300,000 each.\n\nClement ruled last week that Goodyear failed to adequately warn the parish that an under-pressurized tire might explode during inflation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed with the verdict and will appeal,\u201d James Peate, Goodyear\u2019s director of global functions communications, told FOX Business.\n\nThe ruling comes just two months after Goodyear reported quarterly earnings. In the second quarter, the company reported results that missed Wall Street estimates.\n\nTicker Security Last Change %Chg GT GOODYEAR TIRE 14.26 +0.08 +0.56%\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "It's a ruling the company plans to appeal.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/good-year-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
