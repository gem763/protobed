Over the past decade, a growing number of meteorologists and weathercasters have begun addressing the climate crisis either as part of their weather forecasts, or in separate, independent news reports to help their viewers understand what is happening and why it is important.\n\nAnd the reports are having an impact.\n\nStudies by the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication show that in communities where local weather forecasters are reporting on the climate crisis, \u201cpublic opinion is changing more rapidly\u201d, said Ed Maibach, director of the center and an author of the studies. \u201cWe showed a really strong impact \u2013 people who saw the climate reporting came to understand climate change was more personally relevant,\u201d he said.\n\nThe change has come as meteorologists and weather forecasters themselves have changed their opinions on the climate crisis and its causes. In 2008 a survey of some American Meteorological Society members found that only 24% of weathercasters agreed with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that warming was caused by humans. In 2010, a study by Maibach found that 54% agreed that global warming is happening. But by 2017 a full 90% agreed that climate crisis is happening, and 80% indicated it was human-caused.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been an enormous shift,\u201d he said.\n\nThe change has been partially brought about by Climate Central\u2019s Climate Matters reporting program founded after Maibach released a study showing that the public has a high degree of trust with local forecasters.\n\n\u201cAll TV weather forecasters are really good science communicators,\u201d Maibach says. Not only are they scientists, but they are trusted by their viewers because they don\u2019t generally report on politics or other controversial topics, he says.\n\nToday, more than 600 TV weathercasters participate in the program, which provides training, scientific information, charts and videos for education and newsroom use.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of four of those local TV news forecasters.\n\n\u2018You have the chance to shift the public view a little\u2019\n\nKeith Carson, WLBZ/WCSH, Maine\n\nAt the beginning of his career, Carson wasn\u2019t fully onboard with the idea that climate crisis was occurring and it was caused by humans. Carson began working in the field in 2006. Today, though, he says: \u201cFrankly it\u2019s getting harder and harder to deny it scientifically.\u201d And now he knows how easy it is now for anyone to twist facts and create even more divisiveness.\n\nThese days, Carson regularly shares information about the climate crisis and other scientific topics with viewers through a nightly science segment called \u201cBrain Drops\u201d.\n\nFor Carson, the issue is bigger than just climate change. \u201cIf people are going to dismiss science and the scientific process, it opens the door for other regressions,\u201d in scientific thinking.\n\nCarson talks about climate change with his viewers about once every two weeks. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to do, but not to hammer it daily. It\u2019s against human nature to change minds, and hammering it home daily would make some people dig in more.\u201d He approaches the topic like many of his colleagues do, by simply presenting the facts about what is happening.\n\nWeathercasters, he says, have a unique opportunity because they are an integral, well liked part of the community, \u201cand you have the chance to shift opinion a little\u201d.\n\nWhile Carson does get some pushback from viewers, most of those who comment on his climate reporting are not his viewers, he says.\n\nFrom stories on breweries to ranchers: find a way to relate\n\nElisa Raffa, of KOLR10/KOZL, Springfield, Missouri\n\nRaffa, a self-described science geek, believes her job is to educate her viewers about how climate change will impact them. She\u2019s done stand-alone news segments about how climate change will impact fishing in local lakes, a local coffee shop and a local brewery. One piece detailed how ranchers must be more careful with their cattle as black vultures move into the region because of warming temperatures.\n\n\u201cIt gets people to look at climate change outside of the political realm,\u201d she says.\n\nPlay Video 1:41 Elisa Raffa: 'I love learning about how weather and climate impact everything we do' \u2013 video\n\nRaffa is careful to ask objective questions about things such as precipitation and temperature, and rarely outwardly underscores climate change as the problem. Her sources usually do that themselves. That hits home with viewers who see climate change from a relatable perspective.\n\n\u201cClimate change will impact us in so many ways, and I love teaching my viewers and helping them learn how they can prepare and adapt and be more resilient,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to her special reports, Raffa talks about the climate crisis in subtle ways during her forecasts. She highlighted a recent uptick in morning high temperatures hoping to show her viewers that overnight temperatures are increasing.\n\n\u201cThis is what I signed up for,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a science issue. It\u2019s my duty to communicate this to the public. If I don\u2019t, who is going to?\u201d\n\n\u2018I used to be more subtle \u2026 but now we see more effects\u2019\n\nJorge Torres, KOB-TV, Albuquerque, New Mexico\n\nOver his career, Torres, chief meteorologist at KOB, has become bolder in addressing climate change. \u201cIn the beginning I was more subtle, but as more and more facts become apparent, I am more open now saying this is human induced. For me the biggest aspect is carbon dioxide,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are seeing that increasing globally and we are seeing the effects locally.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Torres did an extensive news piece on the issue of water in New Mexico and how smaller snow pack will impact the state\u2019s water supply. Temperatures are getting warmer and warmer as well, he says, a fact that he points out during his daily forecasts.\n\nPlay Video 1:06 Meteorologist Jorge Torres discusses water conservation during Facebook Live \u2013 video\n\n\u201cWhenever the weather story allows me to say,\u201d something about the climate crisis, he does, but he ensures it is in the proper context.\n\nThe bottom line is that he wants viewers to be open-minded about it. \u201cDon\u2019t just hear something and dismiss it.\u201d\n\nThe forecaster quoting Bubba Gump\n\nHeather Waldman, WGRZ, Buffalo, New York\n\nAs the trusted \u201cstation scientist\u201d, Waldman says that talking about the climate crisis is a natural fit for her and other weathercasters. \u201cIt fits in our identity.\u201d\n\nWaldman and her station have unveiled a series of short, entertaining and informative videos called \u201cthe climate minute\u201d, that are online and are scheduled to run this week on TV.\n\nPlay Video 1:02 Weather presenter Heather Waldman talks global heating in 'The Climate Minute' \u2013 video\n\nThe one-minute videos are time-consuming to produce because while Waldman uses information from Climate Matters, she also does her own research, reading IPCC and other reports.\n\nShe says she decided on short one-minute videos because she doesn\u2019t want to lose the audiences\u2019 attention.\n\n\u201cThe audience isn\u2019t going to pay attention to anything for more than a couple of minutes and we use succinct, catchy images. The goal to find some sort of thing, where people say oh, this will have an impact \u2013 this is affecting me right now.\u201d\n\n'Like a sunburn on your lungs': how does the climate crisis impact health?
