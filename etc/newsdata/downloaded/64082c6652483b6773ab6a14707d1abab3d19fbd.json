The order is primarily directed to the Health and Human Services Department, instructing the agency to undertake more administrative and regulatory measures to secure these policy goals.\n\nSpecifically, the president acted to provide Medicare beneficiaries with more \u201cdiverse and affordable\u201d health plan choices in the Medicare Advantage program, Medicare\u2019s system of competing private plans. Because of the order, health plans will have new regulatory flexibility to respond to customer demands for innovative benefit designs and to incorporate telehealth, which lets patients see their doctor using tools like internet video calls.\n\nThe order would also authorize several other changes improving the practice environment for doctors and helping seniors. The envisioned rule changes would also help relieve doctors and other medical professionals who are wrestling with growing paperwork burdens.\n\nIf finalized, the rule would additionally \u201creduce barriers\u201d for seniors who wish to use \u201cmedical savings accounts,\u201d and thus pay for medical care more easily.\n\nImportantly, Section 3 of the order envisions a rule change in the provision of Medicare Advantage supplemental benefits that would \u201callow Medicare beneficiaries to share more directly in the savings of the program,\u201d including \u201ccash or monetary rebates\u201d that would encourage seniors to seek and secure \u201chigh value\u201d care.\n\nRegulatory Relief Is Working\n\nTrump is building on a three-year record of success, particularly in stewardship of the Medicare Advantage program. His administration has promoted regulatory flexibility that has unleashed market forces in Medicare Advantage, which will secure better care and savings for seniors, as well as savings for taxpayers.\n\nBecause of the Trump administration\u2019s 2018 regulatory changes, Medicare Advantage enrollees, particularly those who are suffering from debilitating chronic illnesses, have access to a much wider variety of supplemental health benefits, including transportation to doctors\u2019 offices, caregiver support, and safety improvements in their home environment.\n\nMedicare Advantage enrollees are also enjoying record increases in health plan choices and benefitting from intense market competition. For next year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projects the number of patient choices at the county level will increase from 33 to 39 plans, representing a 49% increase in beneficiary choice since 2017 and the largest participation rate since 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, seniors are experiencing significant declines in their Medicare Advantage premiums. This year\u2019s average monthly premium is $26.87. Next year, it\u2019s expected to be $23.\n\nAltogether both the Medicare prescription drug program (Medicare Part D) and Medicare Advantage have generated a savings of approximately $2.5 billion in seniors\u2019 premium costs. Better health benefits at lower cost for patients is the essence of value.\n\nPatients are signing up for Medicare Advantage in big and growing numbers. Next year, Medicare Advantage will enroll 24.4 million, or nearly 39% of people in Medicare. That\u2019s up 30% from the time the president took office.\n\nFurther Medicare Reforms Needed\n\nThe administration is doing all in its power under existing law to improve Medicare for beneficiaries and taxpayers. Congress must build on what the president has begun and make further reforms.\n\nDark clouds are on the fiscal horizon. Medicare spending over the next decade, averaging nearly 8%, according to the Medicare trustees, is projected to outpace wages, general inflation, and the growth of the economy. It is also projected to grow faster than other health care spending and private health insurance.\n\nThe initial indicator of trouble is the deteriorating state of the traditional Medicare hospitalization program (Part A), which faces insolvency as early as 2026, meaning that the program will not be able to pay for all of its promised hospital benefits. To get the Medicare hospital program back into long-term fiscal balance, Congress will either have to impose a significant tax increase or resort to major benefit reductions.\n\nThe best path forward would build on the success of the president\u2019s existing reforms.\n\nTrump and Congress should work together and replicate this successful record on Medicare Advantage on a much broader scale. This would require a transition of all Medicare financing to defined contribution financing, similar to Medicare Advantage today, where the government makes a direct payment to the health plan of a senior\u2019s choice. The traditional Medicare model, which is a defined benefit program instead of defined contribution system, is unsustainable in the long term.\n\nIndependent analysts, ranging from the Congressional Budget Office to The Heritage Foundation, estimate that a defined contribution program\u2019s broader choice and greater intensity of market competition could yield substantial program savings.\n\nChoice and competition works. By harnessing the free market forces of choice and competition, compelling traditional Medicare to compete head to head with Medicare Advantage and other private plans, the policymakers would be able to simultaneously slow the growth in Medicare spending, secure better care at lower cost for America\u2019s seniors, and secure serious savings for America\u2019s taxpayers. It\u2019s the right thing to do.", "description": "President Donald Trump is making an ambitious move to build on a string of regulatory relief actions that \u201cprotect and improve\u201d Medicare, the federal health care program that serves approximately 60 million senior and disabled persons.", "authors": ["Robert E.
