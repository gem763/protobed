There are an estimated 1.8 billion people aged between 10 and 24.\n\nThat should make it harder for leaders to be cynical and obstructionist, \"when there are young people saying, 'guys our lives are on the line,'\" McKibben says.\n\n\"Older people are at their best when they are thinking about the generations that come after them, when they are actually, really worrying about their children and their grandchildren.\"\n\nWe're very creative in developing novel solutions and aren't afraid to create radical solutions that are completely out of the ordinary. - Brandon Nguyen, Canadian participant\n\nYoung people are expected to bring a mix of enthusiasm, innovation, and guilt to the climate discussion that organizers hope will help jolt countries into raising their national pledges when it comes to reducing heat-trapping emissions.\n\n''Basically, we need to duplicate, and in some cases triplicate, what the countries have pledged in Paris to keep the temperature below to 1.5 C,\" Luis Alfonso de Alba, the UN special envoy on climate change, said this week.\n\nBill McKibben, co-founder of 350.org, one of the main organizers of Friday's Global Climate Strike, says the current generation of young people is the largest in human history, making them harder to ignore.

Her wish is to convince fellow lawyers to stop working for fossil fuel industries.\n\nYoung see more at stake \u2014 poll\n\n\"Imagine,\" she says, \"we could end global warming.\"\n\nA majority of teenagers in the U.S. believe global warming is caused by humans and that it will personally hurt them and their generation, the Washington Post reported earlier this week, citing a poll it did with the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\n\"Young people have a lot more at stake when it comes to these issues,\" says Brandon Nguyen, Canada's green ticket winner. The 19-year-old university student created a forum to connect high-school environment clubs in Toronto.\n\nHe also worked with NGOs to develop curriculums on renewable energy for teachers across Canada. \"Collaboration on this scale and backed by the UN is basically unprecedented,\" says Nguyen.\n\nHe also thinks the youth summit is a no-brainer. \"We're very creative in developing novel solutions and aren't afraid to create radical solutions that are completely out of the ordinary.\"\n\nKomal Kumar plants mangrove seedlings along the shoreline in Suva, Fiji, in September, 2019.

The 20-year-old also helped build a greenhouse out of 25,500 plastic water bottles at the American University of Sharjah, north of Dubai, where she is taking international studies.\n\n\"It was really fun,\" said Almansoori of the three-year project.\n\nAnd yet while some explore alternative solutions, others are quickly running out of options.\n\nKomal Kumar says at least three villages in Fiji have already been relocated to higher ground because of rising sea levels \u2014 caused by melting ice sheets and glaciers \u2014 while another 435 communities have been identified as being \"at risk.\"\n\nThe 27-year-old has a degree in public health. She's now doing a master's with a focus on climate-induced relocation.\n\n\"It's very sad to know that this is actually happening,\" says Kumar.\n\nPlanned relocation guidelines\n\nPeople are not just leaving behind the land where their ancestors are buried. Many in the Pacific region also feel like \"they're leaving behind their identity.\"\n\nIn December, the government of Fiji laid out its Planned Relocation Guidelines. Kumar is looking into the impact the new policy is having on affected populations.\n\nShe will join Thunberg and Secretary General Antonio Guterres in delivering opening remarks at the Youth Climate Summit on Saturday.\n\nCommitments put forward by the participants will be presented via video during the opening ceremony of the leaders' summit on Monday.\n\nScaled up and replicated\n\nThunberg and two other young people will take to the stage with the UN secretary general to present climate demands and solutions to world leaders gathered in the General Assembly hall.\n\nThe UN says those ideas \"which can be scaled up and replicated\" will be included in the secretary general's outcome report.\n\n\"Everyone is really looking forward to it,\" says Kumar. \"Just to point out to the world leaders 'you know, this is what we want, and this is what you have to do, so you will have to accept it because this is our future that you are talking about, and you don't have the authority to come over and tell us that \u2026 we cannot meet your demands.'\"\n\nThe leaders' summit, which will include private sector pledges, is being used as a springboard to 2020, when as many as 30,000 delegates will meet in Glasgow for the 26th Conference of the Parties, known as COP26, and the crucial implementation phase of the Paris Agreement is set to begin.", "description": "The United Nations hopes the presence of hundreds of young people will motivate governments and corporations to take bold climate action when world leaders meet in New York City for the annual UN General Assembly next week.", "authors": ["Melissa Kent Is A Producer With Cbc News Covering The United Nations Its Headquarters In New York City."], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5288248.1568821441!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/climate-change-thunberg.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
