This is the cardinal\u2019s last chance to have his conviction overturned after a panel of judges in August rejected an earlier appeal.\n\nThe High Court doesn\u2019t automatically grant an appeal hearing but must be persuaded there are special reasons for it. Lawyers have said the hurdle for the Pell case\u2019s being heard is very high. The court typically determines whether to grant a hearing within three months of the application being filed. The High Court\u2019s decisions on appeals are final.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nCardinal Pell\u2019s conviction was a landmark in the global sex-abuse scandal that continues to buffet the Roman Catholic Church. Convictions and allegations made against clergy have threatened to overshadow the reign of Pope Francis. In May, under mounting public pressure to improve accountability, the Vatican laid out new rules for investigating bishops for sexual abuse or its coverup.\n\nThe Vatican has reserved final judgment on Cardinal Pell until the appeal process concludes, though it has banned him from public ministry as a priest.\n\nThe cardinal, the most senior Catholic official to be convicted of child sex-abuse, was found guilty by a jury on five counts, including one of sexual penetration of a minor. A second case against Cardinal Pell involving allegations of child abuse dating back to the 1970s that was set for trial was dropped earlier this year.\n\nCardinal Pell has repeatedly denied allegations of sexual assault and pleaded not guilty. His lawyers have argued throughout the case that a jury should find reasonable doubt about the opportunity the then-archbishop had to abuse two 13-year-olds given the activity that typically went on after mass in the area of the cathedral where the abuse was said to have happened.\n\nIn the August appeal ruling, the three-judge panel decided 2-1 to uphold Cardinal Pell\u2019s conviction. After reviewing more than 30 hours of trial recordings and a transcript of more than 1,000 pages, two judges agreed with the prosecution that the victim who testified against the cardinal was a very compelling witness. The dissenting judge accepted the defense argument that the accuser was inclined to embellish parts of his account and that there were discrepancies in his evidence.\n\nWrite to Robb M.
