Biden is the Democratic frontrunner in the 2020 presidential election. According to some reports, his son Hunter was paid millions when he was a board member for Ukraine's corrupt Burisma gas company.\n\nThe quid pro quo comes in among rumors that Biden pressed for the resignation of Prosecutor Yury Lutsenko in order to protect his son. Trump, according to last week's whistleblower, wanted President Zelensky to promise to investigate the Bidens' scandal. But, the whistleblower admitted to relying on secondhand knowledge. He or she did not hear the conversation with their own ears.\n\nInstead of waiting for more context, Schiff declared the initial complaint to be enough to justify impeachment.\n\nHe is not alone. Several other Democrats want to move on impeachment, too. On the House floor today Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) said if they don't move now they'll be betraying democracy. Even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who's been at odd with Congress's impeachment brigade, sounds more convinced. We will know for sure when she makes her announcement on the matter at 5 p.m.\n\nTrump announced that he will release the full transcript of his call with Zelensky on Wednesday, confident he did nothing wrong. But Democrats want to see the full whistleblower report, too.", "description": ".09/25/2019 0:33:18AM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Katie Pavlich", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/262/f7b3eaf1-9ba7-4bb6-8ecd-854d926df582.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
