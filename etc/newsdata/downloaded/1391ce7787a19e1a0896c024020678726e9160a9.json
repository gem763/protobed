This is about, do you want a democracy in this country or do you want a deep state?\u201d\n\nWallace pushed back, noting that Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday that the whistleblower, who has not been publicly identified, had \u201cacted in good faith\u201d and \u201cfollowed the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut enough with the rhetoric,\u201d Wallace continued. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about some specific facts in this.\u201d\n\nChris Wallace asks Stephen Miller why Present Trump use his private attorney and as we just reported, two other private lawyers, to dig up dirt on Joe Biden. #FNS #FoxNews pic.twitter.com/OzZMrRusq7 \u2014 FoxNewsSunday (@FoxNewsSunday) September 29, 2019\n\nHe then asked Miller to explain why Trump used his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and two other private lawyers to dig up political dirt on Biden from the Ukrainian government.\n\nTrump claims, without evidence, that then-Vice President Biden called for the removal of a notoriously corrupt prosecutor in Ukraine to hamper an investigation into a Ukrainian gas company where his son was a member of its board of directors. Ukrainian authorities have cleared Biden of any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cOne of two things is true, Chris,\u201d Miller said. \u201cEither the Ukrainian government or people associated with it possess real and actual knowledge of corrupt dealings by the Biden family or they don\u2019t. If they do, is it not in the interest of all Americans to know what that is?\u201d\n\nWallace said he planned to discuss Biden later in the interview but wanted an answer to the question at hand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve asked you a specific question, I\u2019d like a specific answer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president has the State Department, he\u2019s got the CIA, he\u2019s got the Pentagon, he\u2019s got a number of other agencies. Why did he use three private lawyers to get information on Biden from the Ukrainian government rather than go through all of the agencies of the government?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo different points: Number one \u2015\u201d Miller began.\n\n\u201cHow about answering my question?\u201d Wallace interrupted. \u201cStephen, I\u2019m asking you a direct question. ... If you don\u2019t know, that\u2019s an acceptable answer.\u201d\n\nMiller continued, \u201cThere\u2019s two issues that were brought up in the phone call \u2015\u201d\n\nWallace cut in again: \u201cWhy did he do it?\u201d\n\nMiller went on to claim that it\u2019s \u201cproper and natural\u201d for Giuliani to look into Biden\u2019s handling of the Ukrainian prosecutor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m simply asking you a question as to why the president didn\u2019t use his government,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cYou apparently aren\u2019t going to answer that question.\u201d\n\nWatch the full exchange below:", "description": "The senior White House adviser pushed a far-right conspiracy theory that the Ukraine whistleblower is a \"deep state operative.\"", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d90e34a2400005f00d4786b.png?cache=lbdcjzfs0g&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
