In order to create interest in the mission, and to inspire students to join in the STEM subjects that make space exploration possible, NASA is sponsoring a contest called Name the Rover. Open to K-12 students in US public, private, and home schools, it is an essay contest in which students will be asked to name the robotic space traveler and explain the reasons behind their chosen appellation.\n\nIf you, a student in your household, or in your class (if you\u2019re a teacher) would like to give it a try, it\u2019s very simple. Just go to the Name the Rover Challenge page, and click on the \u201cStudent and Teacher Signup\u201d button. Entries will be judged on the significance and originality of both the name and the essay chosen.\n\nRules of the contest include:\n\nThe name chosen must be no more than 50 characters, and the essay should be no more than 150 words.\n\nOne entry per student.\n\nThe name can\u2019t be a repetition of a past space mission or NASA flight program.\n\nIf you want to use a real person\u2019s name, they must be deceased.\n\nNo corporate or trademarked names, and of course, the essay must be completely original,\n\nThe deadline to enter is November 1st, and final entries will be put up on the site for a public poll in January 2020.\n\nNot a student? Want to participate anyway? You can help judge the thousands of anticipated entries by signing up as a judge.", "description": "Name the Rover, open to K-12 students in US public, private, and home schools, is an essay contest in which students will be asked to name the robotic space traveler and explain the reasons behind their chosen appellation.", "authors": ["Barbara Krasnoff", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UoTzn17urhsZ7xdTVqTB060CQQM=/0x31:1600x869/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19127263/21383_PIA22111_1600.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-28"}
