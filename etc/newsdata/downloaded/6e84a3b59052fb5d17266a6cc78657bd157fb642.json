Two of them, Fanny Delahalle, 33, and Pierre Goinciv, 32, removed a portrait of the president, copies of which hang in all official buildings in France. They were pictured holding the gold-framed portrait outside the entrance of the building.\n\nProsecutors demanded they be fined \u20ac500 (\u00a3445). The public prosecutor, Rozenn Huon, told the court: \u201cIt\u2019s clearly theft and it has done nothing to help climate change.\u201d\n\nThe judge conceded \u201can object of a very strong symbolic value\u201d had been stolen but said the climate crisis was more serious.\n\n\u201cClimate change is a constant that seriously affects the future of humanity by provoking natural catastrophes that poorer countries don\u2019t have the means to protect themselves against,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf France has undertaken internally \u2026 to respect objectives as the government has, objectives that are probably insufficient but are at least necessary, the documents produced by the defence testify that these objectives will not be reached.\u201d\n\nHe added that the group\u2019s \u201cintrusion\u201d into the town hall had caused only a limited disturbance to public order and the protesters\u2019 actions were a \u201clegitimate call on the president\u201d.\n\nThe public prosecutor\u2019s office said it would appeal against the decision.\n\nThe campaign group ANV-COP21 welcomed the acquittal, saying it took into account France\u2019s \u201cnon-respect of climate objectives and the legitimacy of actions of civil disobedience faced with the urgency of the climate problem\u201d.\n\nA climate protester who carried out a similar action in May was fined \u20ac250.\n\nDelahalle told BFMTV: \u201cThe judge showed great courage making a decision that could affect his career. It is a rare and historic decision \u2026 we hope it will influence other judges. For us, it\u2019s a big victory.\n\n\u201cThe government and Emmanuel Macron are not addressing climate change and this means we are justified in using civil disobedience to challenge them.\u201d", "description": "Two protesters acquitted of theft on basis they were calling for action by French president", "authors": ["Kim Willsher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a010f84cb947f310bb69523ecd17585ab930574/0_0_2940_1764/master/2940.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ee2416e5846d9efcc6e395d842b63f7e", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
