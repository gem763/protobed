the line as toll from protests rises", "language": "en", "text": "Baghdad (AFP) \u2013 Iraq\u2019s leaders were in tense talks on Wednesday over the ouster of the country\u2019s embattled premier, as a rights commission said the latest week of anti-government demonstrations has left 100 dead.\n\nAs night fell, the government faced the mounting pressure of swelling protests, pro-Iran figures defending the prime minister and deadly rockets slamming into Baghdad\u2019s Green Zone.\n\nThe missiles hit a checkpoint near the US embassy, killing one Iraqi military member and wounding others, security sources told AFP.\n\nThe Green Zone, where government offices and many foreign embassies are based, had already boosted security measures in response to protests demanding the government\u2019s downfall.\n\nIn the latest week-long wave of demonstrations, at least 100 people have died and 5,500 more have been wounded, the Iraqi Human Rights Commission said.\n\nThe commission told AFP most of the casualties were civilians who either suffocated by tear gas, sustained trauma wounds from tear gas canisters or were shot dead.\n\nThe number brings the toll since protests first erupted on October 1 to 257 dead and more than 10,000 wounded.\n\nThe protests began over poor services, unemployment and corruption, but have since evolved to demand Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi step down.\n\nAbdel Mahdi, 77, came to power last year through a tenuous partnership between populist cleric Moqtada Sadr and paramilitary chief Hadi al-Ameri.\n\nBut the premier appears to have lost top-tier support, with Sadr calling for his resignation and early elections.\n\nPresident Barham Saleh held talks with Speaker of Parliament Mohammed al-Halbussi and Ameri late Tuesday over the premier\u2019s ouster, an Iraqi government source told AFP.\n\nAmeri appeared to be resisting calls to bring down the premier, the source said, but a parliamentary session on Thursday could bring a new escalation.\n\n\u2013 Gathering votes \u2013\n\nSadr\u2019s Saeroon bloc had \u201cgathered the 65 votes necessary to summon the prime minister, and we hope he will be present\u201d himself, said lawmaker Salam Hadi.\n\nAbdel Mahdi has so far ignored parliamentarians\u2019 demands he appear in front of them for questioning amid speculation he will face a no-confidence vote.\n\nThe kingmakers\u2019 alliance between Sadr and Ameri has been ruptured by the protests, with Saeroon, the biggest bloc in parliament, endorsing the demonstrators.\n\nThe Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force, whose political arm Fatah is parliament\u2019s second-biggest bloc and is chaired by Ameri, has so far backed the government.\n\nSeveral Hashed offices were torched in southern Iraq last week, further straining ties.\n\nAfter an apparent rapprochement between the two blocs on Tuesday night, they appeared to drift apart again.\n\nSadr took to Twitter on Wednesday to pile on pressure, warning that keeping Abdel Mahdi would \u201cturn Iraq into Syria or Yemen\u201d \u2014 both engulfed in bloody wars.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran\u2019s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told Iraqis they should find legal ways to resolve crises instead of hitting the streets.\n\n\u201cThe people of Iraq and Lebanon have some demands that are rightful, but they should know these demands can only be realised within the legal frameworks,\u201d said Khamenei.\n\nLebanon has also been hit by huge protests.\n\nThe United Nations\u2019 top representative in Iraq, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, called again for a national dialogue to \u201cunite against the perils of division and inaction.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Back to square one\u2019 \u2013\n\nMeanwhile, the demonstrations have only grown in number in Baghdad and across the south.\n\nLate Wednesday, a cacophony of honking horns, fireworks and blasts from tear gas canisters used by security forces could be heard in Baghdad\u2019s Tahrir Square.\n\nDemonstrators have shrugged off a litany of government reform plans and called for a new constitution, reworked electoral law and mass resignations from a government they see as corrupt.\n\n\u201cThey should all quit and we should have a national salvation government,\u201d said Alaa Khdeir, 63.\n\nWhile the premier\u2019s departure would be seen as a \u201cvictory\u201d for demonstrators, it would \u201cgive protests a break but not break them,\u201d said Maria Fantappie, an Iraq analyst at the International Crisis Group.\n\n\u201cEven an election with the same election law would bring (the) same figures into parliament and the same process as last year in selecting the prime minister, which puts you once again at square one,\u201d Fantappie said.\n\nSince the US-led invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein in 2003, Iraq\u2019s political system has been gripped by clientelism, corruption and sectarianism.\n\nThe country is ranked by Transparency International as the 12th most corrupt in the world.\n\nThat means getting a job in government \u2014 by far the country\u2019s biggest employer \u2014 is often secured with bribes or connections.\n\nAnger at the state of affairs had been swelling among the youth, who make up 60 percent of Iraq\u2019s nearly 40 million people.\n\nYouth unemployment stands at 25 percent, while one in five live below the poverty line, despite the vast oil wealth of OPEC\u2019s second-largest crude producer.", "description": "Baghdad (AFP) \u2013 Iraq\u2019s leaders were in tense talks on Wednesday over the ouster of the
