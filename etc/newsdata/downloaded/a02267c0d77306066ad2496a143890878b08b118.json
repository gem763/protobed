The eight-year-old then had 11 seizure-free months after being given cannabis oil, she said in an emotive video she posted on Facebook.\n\nBut now Miss Deacon, 40, has been left devastated after Alfie\u2019s fits resumed.\n\nShe says the youngster has developed a tolerance to the treatment \u2013 and now wants a further relaxation of restrictions so that he can be given new products.\n\nIn the video she also revealed that Alfie is being given steroids which have made him aggressive.\n\nMiss Deacon said last night: \u2018I\u2019ve had 11 months seizure-free with Alfie and I\u2019ve had to come to terms with the fact that he\u2019s not now. It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u2019 The hairdresser, from Kenilworth, Warwickshire, described in the video which she posted last month how the youngster had gone \u2018downhill\u2019 and now has clusters of seizures every two weeks. \u2018It\u2019s really, really, really hard and really sad,\u2019 she said. Alfie\u2019s rare condition meant he once suffered up to 30 fits a day.\n\nAlfie Dingley used to suffer 75 seizures a day until he was prescribed an oil-based cannabis tincture overseas. His case saw the then Home Secretary Sajid Javid change the law to allow the use of cannabis oil by the NHS\n\nMiss Deacon found that cannabis administered in the Netherlands helped ease the seizures. In the wake of a shift in public opinion partly prompted by Alfie\u2019s case, legal changes late last year allowed UK doctors to prescribe the drug under strict guidelines. In August, however, NHS spending watchdogs blocked funding for routine cannabis-based drugs because there is insufficient evidence they are safe.\n\nMiss Deacon says she still believes in the benefits of the drug. Last night she told The Mail on Sunday: \u2018Cannabis medicine is amazing for Alfie and it can be amazing for many people.\n\n\u2018But it can cause tolerance in the same way antibiotics can. If you take antibiotics you can become tolerant to them.\n\n\u2018What my son needs is a choice of cannabis oil products to be available.\u2019 Calling new legislation a \u2018crazy PR stunt\u2019, she added: \u2018The law has changed but not one prescription has been done on the NHS and companies haven\u2019t been able to do any imports.\u2019\n\nMiss Deacon said: \u2018What I don\u2019t want is for doctors to turn round and say this treatment doesn\u2019t work. It does work.\u2019", "description": "Mother Hannah Deacon, 40, of Warwickshire, pleaded for the law to be changed so that she could give Alfie Dingley the drug in the UK.
