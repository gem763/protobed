(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)\n\nAs President Trump visits New Mexico for a political rally in a state dominated by Democrats, his campaign is seeking to convert enough Hispanic voters to tilt the electoral college map in Republicans\u2019 favor next year.\n\nHe faces long odds. Poll numbers show the president underwater in the state and with Hispanics nationally.\n\n\u201cHis chances are poor to nonexistent\u201d in New Mexico, said David Wasserman, a political analyst for the Cook Political Report. \u201cThe Hispanic vote is important to his chances in Arizona and Florida, but the real payoff would be if outreach to Hispanic voters limits his losses among suburban whites. In other words, a bank shot.\u201d\n\nFor a campaign flush with cash and seeking several pathways to 270 electoral votes, the New Mexico gambit is the latest example of the president embracing unorthodox strategies for his reelection bid.\n\nTrump campaign officials say the president is serious about flipping New Mexico, which has only been won by a Republican presidential candidate once since 1992. Trump wouldn\u2019t travel more than 1,800 miles for a rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico, if there were no real pathway to victory, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy.\n\nThey point to internal numbers that indicate Trump\u2019s support among Hispanics on the rise, driven in part by the president\u2019s aggressive approach to trade with China. Trump regularly touts the historically low unemployment rate among Hispanics, a trend he claims will propel his own numbers with minority voters in 2020.\n\nWhile the campaign\u2019s claims of growing Hispanic support are not backed by public polling, the president\u2019s decision to travel to New Mexico is an indication that he will make some effort to reach beyond his mostly white base to court new voters ahead of 2020.\n\nBut the president has only hardened his rhetoric and policies targeting immigrants since the 2018 midterm elections that swept Republicans out of power across the state. Democrats won New Mexico\u2019s governorship and all three of its congressional races, flipping a district Trump won by 10 percentage points in 2016.\n\nHe has continued to pursue an unpopular border wall, recently targeting military projects across the country for money after Congress declined to provide funding.\n\n[Senate Democrats to force one more vote against Trump\u2019s border emergency declaration]\n\n\u201cBig crowd expected in New Mexico tonight, where we will WIN,\u201d Trump wrote Monday on Twitter. \u201cYour Border Wall is getting stronger each and every day \u2014 see you in a few hours!\u201d\n\nTrump would have to significantly outperform his 2016 showing to score an upset victory in New Mexico next year. Trump lost to Hillary Clinton by 8 percentage points in the state.\n\nDemocratic turnout increased significantly in 2018, with voters animated in part by Trump\u2019s aggressive crackdown on migration from Central America, said New Mexico Democratic Party Chairwoman Marg Elliston.\n\n\u201cNew Mexicans certainly don\u2019t approve of pulling families apart or putting kids in cages,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for leadership that celebrates our immigrant communities, not demonizes them.\u201d\n\nHispanics make up almost 50 percent of the population in New Mexico, the highest share of any state in the U.S., according to the Census Bureau.\n\nTrump campaign chairman Brad Parscale told reporters last week that his team has been analyzing data from the president\u2019s January rally in El Paso, Texas, and have seen movement among key voting groups that could make New Mexico competitive. Parscale referenced internal polling that he said shows Hispanic voters are in support of Trump\u2019s trade war with China.\n\nTrump\u2019s public courting of Hispanic voters could be an attempt to boost his numbers with suburban white voters who have been turned off the president\u2019s harsh rhetoric on immigration and other issues, Wasserman said.\n\nBy holding a rally with a more diverse electorate than his typical overwhelmingly white crowds, Trump can create imagery that pushes back against claims that he is racist.\n\nThe Trump campaign has been hosting several events targeting Hispanic voters in recent days, including a panel discussion and volunteer training session in Houston last week. The campaign released a statement Monday celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month and announced a second New Mexico event set for Tuesday.\n\nSteve Pearce, New Mexico\u2019s Republican Party chairman, said Trump has tempered his language on immigration since 2016, going out of his way to voice support for legal immigrants. And Trump\u2019s hard-line stance on undocumented immigrants is supported by many Hispanic voters, he said.\n\n\u201cHispanic voters, generally, in New Mexico have come here from Mexico or Central America, and the majority came legally,\u201d Pearce said in an interview. \u201cThey have family members who want to come over, so they prefer an orderly process for immigration.\u201d\n\nPearce said he has encouraged Trump to be more specific when he talks about immigration, and has seen the president\u2019s numbers with Hispanic voters improve in recent months.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about tone, it\u2019s about how you say things and it\u2019s about your intention,\u201d he said.\n\nGuy Cecil, the chairman of the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA, said Monday that there was nothing in his group\u2019s survey research to suggest New Mexico would be a swing state in 2020. He attributed the Trump campaign\u2019s focus there to an effort to attract free media attention.\n\n\u201cIf they want to compete in New Mexico, they should go spend money there,\u201d Cecil said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we will know that they are serious.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s September election modeling concluded that Trump is more likely to win five other states that currently lean Democratic before New Mexico: Nevada, New Hampshire, Virginia, Minnesota and Colorado.\n\nTrump\u2019s approval rating among Hispanic adults stood at 25 percent in a Washington Post-ABC News national poll this month, with 67 percent disapproving. That is 13 points lower than Trump\u2019s overall job approval rating of 38 percent.\n\nIn head-to-head matchups with Joe Biden, combined Post-ABC polls in September and early July found Trump trailing 71-26 percent, which is similar to his losing margin among Hispanics in 2016, according to exit polling.\n\nTrump campaign officials have said their robust fundraising gives them flexibility to invest in traditionally Democratic states like New Mexico.\n\nIn July, Trump and the affiliated committees raising money for his reelection bid said they had raised a record-breaking $108 million in the second quarter of 2019.\n\nPhil Rucker, Michael Scherer and Scott Clement contributed to this report.", "description": "Campaign officials say the president is serious about flipping New Mexico, which a Republican presidential candidate has only won once since 1992.", "authors": ["Toluse Olorunnipa", "White House Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/y0BL7tErrvfyHN3WOXxHoRAmiCg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CVWPPRGYZMI6TP5RQSMIONUUOY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
