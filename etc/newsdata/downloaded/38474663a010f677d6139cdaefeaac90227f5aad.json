( ANTM ) : \"I think this one has bottomed,\" was Cramer's response. Let's check out the charts this morning to see if this is the right time to approach the long side of this leading health benefits company.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of ANTM, below, we can see a mostly bearish setup on this chart. Prices have been in a downtrend from the middle of July and are below the declining 50-day and 200-day moving average lines. A bearish dead or death cross of these two averages could happen this week.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line is pointed down, telling us that sellers of ANTM have been more aggressive and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is bearish. The low of April is tentative support but prices were not in the $250-$230 area for all that long to create support.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of ANTM, below, we can see the past three years of action. Prices have rallied from $120 to over $300, which increases the probabilities that the action of the past 12 months has been a topping pattern. Prices are below the 40-week moving average line, which has been rolling over for much of this year.\n\nThe weekly OBV line shows a peak back in February and some weakness since then. The MACD oscillator is below the zero line now for an outright sell signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of ANTM we can see a bearish price target of $211 being projected.\n\nBottom-line strategy: Unfortunately I am not finding evidence of a technical bottom in ANTM. I would let someone else be a buyer here.", "description": "Technical analysis of Anthem Inc. and strategy on how to trade the stock....ANTM", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Anthem Stock Needs More Of This To Be", "Have Shares Of This Leading Health Benefits Company Bottomed", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "James", "Rev Shark", "Maleeha Bengali", "Paul Price", "Chris Versace"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/8b5d9c18-5ea6-11e8-8b44-cfe603f6ca8e.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
