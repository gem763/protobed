And his billion-dollar Boring Company wants to solve a much more mundane nuisance with urban tunnels: traffic.\n\nBill Gates has sunk $500 million of his own wealth into nuclear power startup TerraPower as part of his push against climate change, per Axios' Amy Harder.\n\nJeff Bezos and Musk believe that humanity's future lies in space, pouring millions into Blue Origin and SpaceX to bring people to orbit, the Moon and beyond.\n\nThe state of play: While details on Kanye's ultimate plan for his housing concept remain sparse, he told Forbes' Zach O'Malley Greenburg earlier this month that the domes \"could be used as living spaces for the homeless, perhaps sunk into the ground with light filtering in through the top.\"\n\nGreenburg also notes that the structures were \"inspired by Luke Skywalker's childhood home\" on the planet of Tatooine from \"Star Wars.\"\n\nThe state of play: While Kanye might be viewed as something of a dilettante \u2014 often jumping between music, fashion and design \u2014 he's had his eye on the architecture space for over a year.\n\nHe tweeted last May that his new architecture arm, called Yeezy Home, was \"looking for architects and industrial designers who want to make the world better.\"\n\nHis Yeezy Home collaborators posted concept renderings of a low-income housing space on Instagram which were later deleted, per The Architect's Newspaper, though its spartan concrete design doesn't seem to reflect the current dome concept.\n\nAnd he told radio host Charlamagne Tha God last year that he wants \"to be one of the biggest real-estate developers of all time\" while the two toured the Calabasas property on which the domes would ultimately be built.\n\n\"We're standing on my first property. I\u2019m going to be one of the biggest real-estate developers of all time, what Howard Hughes was to aircrafts and what Henry Ford was to cars \u2014 just the relationships I have with architects, my understanding of space and sacred proportions, Just this new vibe, this new energy. We're gonna develop cities.\"\n\n\u2014 Kanye West, to Charlamagne Tha God\n\nThe other side: Experts doubt that Kanye's project could ever actually scale to make a dent in Los Angeles' housing problem. \"You would need to build 100,000 of these every year for the next 10 years to scratch the housing backlog,\" Tyler Drew, president of Anubis Properties Inc., told Realtor.com.\n\nHe also cited the city's zoning laws and its activist, \"not-in-my-backyard\" population as roadblocks to ever seriously expand Kanye's affordable housing concept.\n\nSuch zoning restrictions, which disproportionately impact low-income residents and people of color, limit cities from getting denser and are often the primary drivers of exploding housing costs in booming cities, as Axios' Erica Pandey reported.\n\nGo deeper: The state of affordable housing in Los Angeles", "description": "\"I'm going to be one of the biggest real-estate developers of all time.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/OWmm-yyNW4HegARJ94qUh5AMMVo=/0x313:3000x2000/1920x1080/2019/08/01/1564686434598.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-05"}
