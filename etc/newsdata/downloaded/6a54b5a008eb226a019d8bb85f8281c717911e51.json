This marketplace of ideas as a metaphor is great, and that\u2019s how science proceeds. That\u2019s how we make progress. Unfortunately, many academic settings, including my own, are becoming more of an activist setting\u2014meaning you\u2019re not testing ideas, promoting the results of research; you\u2019re asking for someone to agree with you, essentially.\n\n\u201cJosephson cautioned that universities need to stop being about groupthink and instead embrace debate and differences of opinion,\u201d the Daily Signal reported.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s social activism is overriding academic inquiry and the search for truth and worst of all its overriding the well being of many patients,\u201d Josephson said on the steps of the High Court, where several women held signs to support him that read \u201cProtect Fairness for Women\u201d and \u201c#SexNotGender.\u201d\n\nJosephson warned Supreme Court justices of the gravity of their decision in three cases, one by a man who was fired from his job at a funeral home when he told his boss he was going to change his name and dress as a woman and two others by homosexual men who said they were fired because of their sexual orientation.\n\n\u201cIf the Supreme Court reads gender identity into federal law, a lot of people will be silenced or punished for their views,\u201d Josephson said. \u201cI\u2019m living proof of that.\u201d\n\nThese cases are Bostock v. Clayton County Georgia, No. 17-1618; Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda, No. 17-1623; and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc. v. EEOC, No. 18-107 in the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter.", "description": "Pyschiatrist Allan Josephson said at a protest at the Supreme Court that he lost his job for speaking the truth about gender dysphoria.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Allen-Josephson-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
