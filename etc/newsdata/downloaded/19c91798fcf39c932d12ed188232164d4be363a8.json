The surest way to bring the sweetness out of a scorpion is to surprise them with a thoughtful present. Scorpios love receiving things that are sentimental and rare. Below, we\u2019ve compiled some ideas.\n\nScorpio is an intuitive water sign, and most are curious about the occult, and the veil is thin during their season! This means it\u2019s easier to connect with spirits on the other side\u2014for better or worse! A Ouija board can help, but always do a proper banishing ritual before and after using it to protect yourself from potential negative entities...if you believe in that kind of thing!\n\nThey may enjoy gifts to show their sign off, like this death-themed necklace, or a beautiful, dark \u201cshadow crown\u201d because Scorpio\u2019s ruling planet is Pluto, the planet of death and rebirth. For something more subtle, a scorpio pendant.\n\n\n\nScorpio is symbolized by the scorpion, which can be found in the desert. This mesmerizing shifting sand art would be a perfect statement piece for your Scorpio friend\u2019s living space.\n\n\n\nThe phoenix, a bird from greek mythology that dies in a burst of flames and is then reborn, is a symbol for transformation, a theme deeply tied to Scorpio. Get your Scorpio friend this phoenix candle or pendant for rebirth, magic, and healing.\n\nTo match the season\u2019s themes of death and rebirth, it\u2019s probably no surprise that mysterious Scorpios also love to shroud themselves in wine red, autumnal oranges, muddy brown, and mystical purples\u2014and they like silks and velvets!\n\nMost Scorpios have gone through a goth or metal phase, if they aren\u2019t still in one! Anything studded or in black leather is sure to delight them, like this studded bag or a classic biker jacket in real or faux leather:\n\nReconnecting with nature helps Scorpio remember what\u2019s important in life, and provides a fun way for them to bond with their friends, whether they're going to the botanical gardens to sketch or taking a hike with their crew. Take your Scorpio friend on a tour of a garden like the San Francisco Conservatory of Flowers (or somewhere local), where you can book this private tour by horticulture experts, including some seasonally-scary sounding carnivorous plants, complete with a visit to a beer garden!\n\nFor something a little different, pick up a Scorpio-worthy picnic backpack in black, or this travel bar with chambers and leather straps, to have lunch in a graveyard in the spirit of Halloween (probably one of your Scorpio friend\u2019s favorite holidays).\n\nYou can also help your Scorpio friend get festive with these or a pumpkin scent for the bathroom. This black cat candle melts to reveal a metal skeleton.\n\n\n\nIf your Scorpio friend is into something even more adventurous, help them prepare with a survival kit tucked inside a military grade aluminum flashlight.\n\nWhile Scorpios love an adventure, they crave control and comfort in their surroundings. Gift them something that helps them carve out their own space while they\u2019re away from home, like a portable espresso maker so they can have quality espresso anywhere.\n\nNoise-canceling headphones can help them tune out strange noises:\n\n\n\nA cute frame lets your Scorpio friend bring something along that reminds them of home while they\u2019re away:\n\nTravel-friendly loungewear that is packable and washable, so they feel comfortable in any new place:\n\nScorpios who prefer to stay in can still get in touch with nature. These plushy, nature-inspired \u201cstone\u201d pillows are great as floor cushions for hanging at home with friends:\n\nEach zodiac sign rules a body part, and regenerative Scorpio\u2019s is the genitals. Your Scorpio friend may enjoy this beautiful illustration by Robin Eisenberg, the artist whose illustrations can be found in Astro Guide, or something sexy like innovative condoms or lingerie with an edge.\n\nEven people who aren't familiar with astrology know that Scorpio is a sexy sign. Hook them up with some items for whatever their preference is in the bedroom, like a luxurious rabbit vibrator, cock ring, or prostate massager.\n\nScorpio is known by astrologers as the detective of the zodiac. Themes like security and privacy are important to them, so they\u2019ll appreciate a tool that helps keep their digital life on lockdown.\n\nIf your Scorpio friend wants to take their investigation skills up a level, they may enjoy taking an online course on computer forensics.\n\nFor entertainment, they may enjoy a good murder mystery like this set by Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling, written under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith.\n\nAll Scorpios fantasize about revenge! Get them a classic revenge story, or make them a mixtape (playlist) with the best revenge hits. For some inspiration, check out Astro Guide\u2019s Scorpio season playlist.\n\nScorpios are fascinated by money. As the sign of death, they know they \u201ccan\u2019t take it with them,\u201d but they still enjoy reading about it, especially when it comes to things like long-term financial planning and foreign currency. They may enjoy this memoir in which Andre Iguodala parlayed income from his career as an NBA player into tech investments and his other passions.\n\nIntuitive Scorpio is fascinated by psychology, and also by communication. Your Scorpio friend may enjoy reading up on psychic self-defense or essential negotiation strategies.\n\nScorpios love having high-tech home goods that no one else owns. They\u2019ll love showing off a robotic bartending system they can load up with liquor and mixers, that makes drinks to order in seconds. If they have a cat, they\u2019ll be dazzled by this futuristic looking, WiFi-enabled, self-cleaning litter box.\n\nFor something less bulky but still impressive, your Scorpio may like this automatic pan stirrer.\n\nScorpios are hugely creative! Get them something that helps expand their imaginations, like this painting set inspired by Bob Ross (who was a Scorpio) or box full of ideas.\n\nScorpios love to be challenged by martial arts, boot camp, or survival-style workouts. The sign is also ruled by warrior planet Mars, and the planet of destruction, Pluto, so remind them how unfuckwithable they are, with an open ticket to participate in a Tough Mudder challenge next year!\n\nScorpios may also overexert themselves and end up dealing with swelling or headaches. Learning to slow down and unwind is also important! This on-the-spot relief for headaches is a great thing for Scorpios to have on hand.\n\nScorpios are intrigued by fate! Gift this astrology book about the nodes, that explains the key to discovering hidden talents, deep desires, and true life purpose, to help your Scorpio friend explore their destiny.\n\nTransformation is a major theme for Scorpio. Breathwork is a powerful modality for inner-healing and reconnection to self and spirit.\n\nScorpios have very intense emotions, which they can ride more easily when they\u2019re connected to the present moment and their surroundings. Meditation can help them achieve that! A meditation bench can help them create a space for it at home, but there are also tools to take the practice with them wherever they go.\n\nVICE Media may make a small commission on products linked in this article.\n\n", "description": "This mysterious water sign may seem hard to please, but we know how to get on their good side.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5daf0fc0a776d9000a2fd27b/lede/1571769129035-scorpioheader.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8035714285714286xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
