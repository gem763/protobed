Lots.\u201d Later, he added, \u201cThe Democrats on the stage hate Turkey. The country, not the meal. They might be right.\u201d\n\nThen came former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s answer to a question about Warren\u2019s wealth tax proposal.\n\n\u201cI think it's part of the solution,\u201d he said, before going on to accuse Senator Warren of being \u201cmore focused on being punitive and pitting some part of the country against the other instead of lifting people up and making sure that this country comes together around those solutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think of a woman that I met in Las Vegas, Nevada,\u201d O\u2019Rourke continued. \u201cShe's working four jobs, raising her child with disabilities, and any American with disabilities knows just how hard it is to make it and get by in this country already.\u201d\n\nIt was this anecdote that caught O\u2019Reilly\u2019s ear. He wasn\u2019t buying it. \u201cBeto says he met a woman working FOUR jobs,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cAnd raising a special needs child. I don\u2019t believe him. Sorry.\u201d\n\nThe response from O\u2019Rourke came with receipts.\n\nAlong with a photo of the woman and her disabled daughter, he replied, \u201cThis is her. Her name is Gina. Her daughter's name is Summer. The problem with our economy is she has to live in her car\u2014while a disgraced TV host like you makes millions.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly, who at one point had enough money to shell out at least $32 million in sexual harassment settlements before Fox News finally decided to cut him loose, had nothing to say in response to that.\n\nBut the tweet did get a response from health care expert and former Obama administration official Andy Slavitt, who tweeted, \u201cI would invite @BillOReilly to get a real understanding of what life is like for many in the disability community or raising a special needs or chronically ill child. But that would be cruel to the people who\u2019d have to meet him.\u201d\n\nStephen Colbert Takes Bill O\u2019Reilly to Task Over His $32 Million Sexual-Harassment Settlement\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
