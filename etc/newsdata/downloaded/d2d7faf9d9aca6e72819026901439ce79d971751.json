We do, so we started asking. Welcome to Why Is Your Skin So Good. Photo: Courtesy of Kathleen Hou\n\nWant more skin care? Join our Facebook Group, the Beauty of It All.\n\nAs the Cut\u2019s beauty director, Kathleen Hou is obsessed with quality. She won\u2019t recommend a product unless she\u2019s sure she can say that it really works. But she knows that her own favorite products won\u2019t be right for everyone.\n\n\u201cPeople talk to me about skin care all the time, but the thing about skin care and beauty is that it\u2019s different for everybody,\u201d she says. \u201cA fight recently broke out on the Cut\u2019s Instagram when we posted a meme about the order in which you should apply your skin care routine, and suggested oil go on last. It\u2019s all okay, people! If it works for you, you do you.\u201d Her one nonnegotiable is sunscreen \u2014 she likes Make P:rem\u2019s Blue Ray Sun Gel.\n\nHou is particularly fond of Korean and Japanese products. \u201cI feel like the markets there are so competitive that the products have to be well formulated and use cutting-edge technology,\u201d she explains. Read on for her current skin care routine, which features plenty of K-beauty and J-products, plus a booster that reminds her of Fast and Furious.\n\nThe Micellar Water\n\nSimple Micellar Cleansing Water \u201cIf I\u2019m wearing a full face of makeup and not feeling too lazy, I\u2019ll soak some cotton pads with micellar water to remove it all first. I\u2019ve tried lots of brands and honestly, I don\u2019t notice that much of a difference between them. (But I also still wash my face afterward, so I\u2019m not relying on it as my sole method of protection, if you know what I mean.) Garnier, Simple Skincare, and Bioderma (a little more expensive) all make good ones that don\u2019t leave your skin feeling sticky or parched dry afterward. I do this to make my cleansers work a little less hard, or if I\u2019ve been testing stubborn mascara or anything long-lasting.\u201d $5 at Target Buy\n\nThe Cleanser\n\nTatcha Pure One Step Camellia Cleansing Oil \u201cTwo things have made the biggest difference in my skin-care routine. The first is the double cleanse. My mom told me for years that I should be double cleansing, but I thought this was just overprotective mom advice, like when she tells me to print out my boarding pass even though I have it on my phone. Like many things, it turns out she was right. Once I started double cleansing, my skin (along with my pillows) was much cleaner and brighter. There\u2019s no point in spending money on fancy serums if you\u2019re going to put them on top of dirty skin. It\u2019s like wearing your shoes to bed. It doesn\u2019t take that much extra time to wash your face twice anyway, and if you\u2019re using nicely formulated cleansers, your skin won\u2019t feel dried out. I like to use Tatcha Camellia Oil Cleanser (my mom even likes this one) along with a balmy one with a silky texture, like Eve Lom\u2019s Morning Time Cleanser. Honorable mentions also go to the Then I Met You Cleanser, and for when I have had a real day and need to fall into a pillow immediately, the Sarah Chapman Skinesis Ultimate Cleanse. The Skinesis and Eve Lom original cleanser (the kind with a muslin cloth) are the only ones I feel comfortable doing a single cleanse with.\u201d $48 at Sephora Buy\n\nThe Serum\n\nCl\u00e9 de Peau Le S\u00e9rum \u201cUsually, serum is used right before moisturizer. But lately, I\u2019ve been testing these new serums that go on before everything else. This one, from Cl\u00e9 de Peau Beaut\u00e9, is supposed to make your skin really glow. It contains a lot of different antioxidants and botanicals that allegedly help \u2018strengthen\u2019 your skin, but what I thought was interesting is that it contains a special form of bio-hyaluronic acid. Every good skin-care nerd knows that hyaluronic acid absorbs up to 1,000 times its weight in water. This is a special form that allegedly absorbs twice that. And the more hydrated skin is, the glowier it is. Honorable mention also goes to iS Clinical Active Serum.\u201d $275 at Cl\u00e9 de Peau Beaut\u00e9 Buy\n\nThe Toner\n\nShiseido Future Solution LX Concentrated Balancing Softene \u201cI started using a softener (also known as a toner) because someone asked me, \u2018Do you want soft skin?\u2019 Always yes. This one from Shiseido is one of the best I\u2019ve tried. Toner is a little difficult to understand because it gets into a larger discussion about pH, but basically, it helps your skin-care products absorb better and balances your skin. Your skin is like a dry sponge, as Charlotte Cho once explained to me. It can\u2019t absorb a thick cream right away; you need to prep it with a layer of hydration first, like wetting a sponge before you put on the soap. This one has a nice, thick, viscous texture so it feels like I\u2019m really injecting my skin with hydration.\u201d $107 at Sephora Buy\n\nThe Retinoid\n\nDifferin Acne Treatment Gel \u201cRetinoid really changed my skin. Like everyone else who has ever done this column, I had terrible hormonal acne in my early 20s \u2014 giant, cystic bumps that no cute pimple sticker would have covered. I suffered through the retinoid uglies with Differin, and I survived. I don\u2019t get hormonal breakouts anymore \u2014 although note, this is my personal acne story; everyone is different. Although Differin is over-the-counter, it is very strong. Lately I\u2019ve been experimenting with Shani Darden\u2019s Retinol Serum instead to fade dark spots.\u201d $13 at Target Buy\n\nThe Moisturizer\n\nKlairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream \u201cMy mom gave me a bottle of oil of Olay (the plain kind, not even Regenerist) when I was 16 and told me to start applying it every morning and night, from my neck to my forehead. That\u2019s how I got into moisturizing. I also remember my mom spending five to ten minutes every single night slathering and lightly \u2018slapping\u2019 (for circulation) an array of products on her face. I don\u2019t do the slapping, but I follow the rest of her advice. I like moisturizers that make my skin look dewy and don\u2019t feel excessively creamy. I also like them to feel cooling, and never sticky or slimy. Since moisturizer is my last step before bed, it needs to have a good bed feel and not stick to my pillow. My most recent favorite was Tatcha\u2019s Dewy Cream, which I sadly ran out of. It consistently made my face look less gray and less tired, and made my cheekbones glisten like freshly steamed dim sum. Honorable mentions also go to Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream, Sunday Riley\u2019s Tidal Cream, and, if you want a rich relative to buy you something, Sisley\u2019s Black Rose Skin Infusion Cream.\u201d $25 at Soko Glam Buy\n\nThe Booster\n\nPaula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster \u201cIf I want to give my moisturizer a little boost, I\u2019ll use these niacinamide drops from Paula\u2019s Choice. I add a few droppers to a moisturizer morning and night, and it\u2019s like when Paul Walker\u2019s character in the Fast and Furious adds nitro to his race car. It\u2019s a concentrated form of B3, which helps even out my skin tone and makes it look less shadowy and dull.\u201d $44 at Dermstore Buy\n\nThe Eye Cream\n\nCOSRX Honey Ceramide Full Moisture Cream \u201cMy rules for eye cream are that it needs to be super creamy and spreadable. My mom always taught me to apply it with my ring finger, because it uses the least amount of pressure and the eye area is \u2018VERY DELICATE!\u2019 as she likes to emphasize. She\u2019s right \u2014 it\u2019s the only part of the body that doesn\u2019t produce any oil. I like this one because it has an almost gluey texture but a silky feel so it really clings to my under-eye area. I have a wrinkle under my eyes that I named Fred, and he comes and goes. He\u2019s around less often when I use this eye cream.\u201d $26 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nStay in touch.
