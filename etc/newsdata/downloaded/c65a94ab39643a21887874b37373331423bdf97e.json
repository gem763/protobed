These assets originally came from QCX at the direction of Gerry (Gerald Cotten, QuadrigaCX\u2019s former CEO),\u201d Robertson said in the statement.\n\nWhile the exact amount of assets to be surrendered isn\u2019t mentioned in the statement, a supporting statement from EY estimates the figure to be $9 million (CAD $12 million).\n\nWhile the exact amount of assets to be surrendered isn\u2019t mentioned in the Robertson\u2019s note, a supporting statement from EY estimates the figure to be $9 million (CAD $12 million).\n\nThis figure is based on the estimated value of Cotten\u2019s estate, which is said to include luxury vehicles and dozens of properties in Nova Scotia.\n\nRobertson will be holding on to $162,700 in personal assets which include, retirement savings, a Jeep, jewelry, and some shares in QuadrigaCX and its associated entities.\n\nRobertson says she had no \u201cdirect knowledge of how Gerry operated the business prior to his death,\u201d and that she was not aware of his improper actions in managing the QuadrigaCX business.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, she also denies knowledge of Gerry\u2019s suspicious trading activities and appropriation of user funds. All of which effectively contributed to the downfall of the exchange.\n\nThe Canadian exchange was thrown into turmoil after the untimely death of its CEO, Gerald Cotten, late last year. Unfortunately for users of the exchange, Cotten didn\u2019t have any contingency plans in place and was the only person who knew the company\u2019s passwords.\n\nWhile I\u2019m sure some affected users will be pleased to see some assets recovered, there\u2019s still a long way to go find the whole $134 million that\u2019s said to have been lost in the exchange\u2018s collapse.\n\nH/T \u2013 CoinDesk\n\nWant more Hard Fork?
