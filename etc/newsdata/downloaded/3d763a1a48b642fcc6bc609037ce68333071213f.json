It turns out that they are being protected from Syria itself.\n\nWashington\u2019s claims that oilfields needed protection from the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) terrorist group were just a pretext to backtrack on the withdrawal of the US troops from Syria, which had earlier been announced by Donald Trump.\n\nSuch a statement sounds especially confusing as \u201cback in March, the US already announced that Islamic State is defeated, crushed,\u201d he reminded the attendance in Geneva.\n\nAlso on rt.com Russian MoD says US protects oil smugglers in Syria, offers aerial images as proof\n\nLavrov, Turkish FM Mevlut Cavusoglu, and Iranian FM Mohammad Javad Zarif got together to discuss the official launch of the Syrian Constitutional Committee to take place in Geneva on Wednesday.\n\nAnother pressing issue on the agenda was the ceasefire in northern Syria, which was negotiated by Russia and Turkey in Sochi last week, but was due to expire later on Tuesday.\n\nCavusoglu warned that any Kurdish units, whom Ankara views as terrorists, remaining in the \u201csafe zone\u201d on the Turkish-Syrian border after the truce ends will be eliminated. However, he pointed out that Turkey trusts Moscow when it said that the Kurds have left the area, per the agreement.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
