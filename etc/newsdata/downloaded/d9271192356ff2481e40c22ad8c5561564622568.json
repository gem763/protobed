election, telling Neil: \u201cI\u2019d rather have a general election but we are not in control of this unfortunately, so should that opportunity come on Saturday to have that referendum on the deal \u2026 in that circumstance, there\u2019s an opportunity there, and the pragmatic, sensible thing for the Labour Party to do, given that we\u2019ve been asking for this, would be to take that opportunity.\u201c\n\nIt remains unclear whether a referendum amendment will be tabled on 19 October, which is expected to be the first Saturday sitting of both Houses of Parliament since the Falklands War, taking place as hundreds of thousands of supporters of a People's Vote flood the streets of the capital in the Together for the Final Say march.\n\nAlthough the government tabled a motion for the Saturday sitting on Wednesday, it could still be called off if Mr Johnson returns empty-handed from Brussels.\n\nAnd if he comes back with a deal, he will need the support of the 10 DUP MPs, the bulk of members of the European Research Group of Tory eurosceptics and the majority of the 21 Conservative MPs stripped of the whip for rebelling over no-deal, as well as a handful of Labour Leavers to force it through the Commons.\n\nIf he looks set for defeat, it is all but certain that opposition parties will allow the deal to be voted down in parliament as Theresa May\u2019s was, rather than offer Mr Johnson the potential lifeline of putting it to a confirmatory referendum.\n\nMs Chapman's comments suggest that Labour has resolved its long-running internal debate between going for a referendum, as advocated by senior figures, such as deputy leader Tom Watson and shadow chancellor John McDonnell, or insisting on an election first, as the circle around Mr Corbyn would prefer.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is

To say which weapon we are going to use before we know which battle we are fighting would be foolish.\u201d\n\nA Liberal Democrat bid to amend the Queen\u2019s Speech to include a confirmatory referendum is thought unlikely to gain broad cross-party support next Tuesday.\n\nThe government tabled a motion in the Commons on Wednesday for both Houses of Parliament to sit from 9.30am until noon on Saturday.\n\nBut this motion must be moved to a vote of MPs on Thursday before the sitting is confirmed. And the wording of any motion for debate is not expected to be known until late in the day.", "description": "Labour is ready to vote for a Final Say referendum on Saturday if Boris Johnson brings an Eu withdawal deal back from Brussels, the party's\u00a0shadow Brexit\u00a0minister has said.
