James responded by making the game-winning play in the 34-27 win over the Packers on Thursday night.\n\nJennifer Lopez and Shakira to headline Super Bowl 2020 half-time show Read more\n\nWith 25 seconds left, James jumped a quick slant by Marquez Valdes-Scantling and tipped Aaron Rodgers\u2019 pass into the end zone where Nigel Bradham collected it and sealed the victory.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a no-name out there, so when somebody that doesn\u2019t get a lot of playing time gets in the game, that\u2019s the target,\u201d James said. \u201cThat\u2019s the game plan. Coaches tell you, \u2018Go at him. That\u2019s the weak link.\u2019 But as the weak link, I still have to be as prepared as the starters.\u201d\n\nJordan Howard gashed Green Bay for his second career three-touchdown game and the Eagles (2-2) ended a two-game losing streak.\n\nHoward finished with 87 yards on 15 carries and two touchdowns rushing and one receiving, Carson Wentz went 16 for 27 for 160 yards, three scores and no turnovers, and the Eagles rebounded after losing consecutive games by a combined seven points.\n\n\u201cWe already were confident,\u201d Howard said. \u201cWe already believed in ourselves. It probably reassured everybody else.\u201d\n\nRodgers started 10 for 10 and finished 34 for 53 for 422 yards, two touchdowns and a fumble that set up a short Philadelphia scoring drive.\n\nDavante Adams had a career-high 180 yards on 10 catches for Green Bay, but he wasn\u2019t on the field for the Packers (3-1) on the last drive because of a toe injury.\n\nRob Gronkowski was dangerously wrong when he says CTE is 'fixable' | Ian McMahan Read more\n\n\u201cObviously, having him out there would have been for the better, but we had a lot of chances down the stretch,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cWe moved the ball well all day long. We just struggled in the red zone.\u201d\n\nAdams was hurt after making a catch in the fourth quarter that gave the Packers first-and-goal at the 8. Avonte Maddox was called for pass interference on the next play while teammate Andrew Sendejo collided with him.\n\nMaddox was carted off the field on a stretcher late in the fourth quarter, which forced coach Doug Pederson to turn to James.\n\nRodgers had first and goal from the 1 after the delay and threw four straight incompletions.\n\n\u201cCredit the defense, man, it was twice down there,\u201d Pederson said. \u201d... Any time you can keep an Aaron Rodgers team out of the end zone, it\u2019s a positive thing.\u201d\n\nAfter punting on its first two drives and falling behind 10-0, Philadelphia scored on four straight possessions against a defense that had only given up 35 points through the first three games.\n\nSacked six times in the previous two games, Wentz managed to stay upright. Zach Ertz had a team-high seven catches for 65 yards, and Alshon Jeffery, who missed all but six snaps over the past two weeks with a calf injury, finished with 38 yards and a touchdown on three catches.\n\nRodgers and Adams connected on a 58-yard completion on the opening drive. It was the longest play of the season for Green Bay, which scored a touchdown on its opening drive for the third consecutive game. Aaron Jones scored from 3 yards out two plays later to give the Packers the early lead.\n\nMason Crosby added a field goal in the beginning of the second quarter to make it 10-0.\n\nThe Eagles finally got a little momentum on a 67-yard return by Miles Sanders on the ensuing kickoff. The return set up a 6-yard score by Jeffery.\n\nGreen Bay added another field goal to take a 13-7 lead.\n\nWentz found tight end Dallas Goedert for a 3-yard touchdown strike to give the Eagles a 14-13 lead just before the two-minute warning.\n\nRodgers fumbled on the following drive after a strip-sack by Derek Barnett. The Eagles capitalized with 1-yard score by Howard. Howard\u2019s touchdown made it 21-13 with 54 seconds to go.\n\nRodgers needed just 50 seconds to lead the Packers 70 yards. The two-time MVP found Geronimo Allison for a 19-yard touchdown to make it 21-20 at the half.\n\nThe Eagles opened the second half with a 20-yard score from Wentz to Howard. After a failed two-point conversion, Philadelphia led 27-20.\n\nJimmy Graham got his first catch and score since Week 1. Graham had six catches for 61 yards and a 14-yard touchdown that tied the game at 27-27 with 3:16 to go in the third.\n\nHoward scored his third touchdown on a 2-yard run that made it 34-27 at the start of the fourth.\n\nThe Eagles picked up the victory despite committing nine penalties for 93 yards.", "description": "Philadelphia scored a crucial road victory over Green Bay behind big efforts from Jordan Howard and Carson Wentz", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e0c5389c1b1f640e15846939010e5277ffdcfeb/0_122_3648_2189/master/3648.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1892cc955c942d5ad586eb92bcdc10c3", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
