It said it has started the concept appraisal and selection phase activities of the Greater Buchan area development.\n\nThe company separately reported that an independent assessment of the JD discovery and the Buchan discoveries located in the North Sea blocks, estimates that they contain a combined a mid-case resource of 94.7 million barrels of oil.\n\nWrite to Oliver Griffin at oliver.griffin@dowjones.com; @OliGGriffin\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 08, 2019 04:42 ET (08:42 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
