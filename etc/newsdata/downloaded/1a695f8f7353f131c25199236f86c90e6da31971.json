There are cameras in its price range that will give you better image quality, and there are cheaper cameras \u2014 even from Fujifilm \u2014 that offer more features.\n\nBut I love the X-Pro2, and I can\u2019t really say why without spilling my subjective opinion. That\u2019s because the X-Pro2 itself is an opinionated camera \u2014 and I happen to agree with it about a great many things.\n\nThe $1699.95 X-Pro2 is, as you might expect, a follow-up to the X-Pro1. That camera came out four years ago, and was Fujifilm\u2019s first mirrorless camera with interchangeable lenses. The X-Pro2 doesn\u2019t change the outer body too much, although there are a few tweaks we\u2019ll get into later that do make a meaningful difference to the shooting experience. It\u2019s still a convincing, chunky facsimile of a rangefinder camera, with shutter speed and exposure compensation dials designed to be used with lenses with aperture rings. It\u2019s also now weather-resistant and feels more solidly built in general. Every Fujifilm X-Series mirrorless camera since the X-Pro1 used essentially the same sensor and had near-identical image quality; the X-Trans II sensor simply added phase-detection autofocus points. But with the X-Pro2, Fujifilm\u2019s third-generation sensor has finally seen daylight, bumping resolution from 16 to 24 megapixels and maximum native ISO from 6400 to 12800. There\u2019s a new chip to match, too, the X-Processor Pro, and the autofocus system has been upgraded to 273 points, of which 77 are phase-detect. The camera can shoot at eight frames per second with continuous phase AF, and is the first X-series camera to have dual SD card slots. It also has slightly better video quality than its forebears, though I don't think anyone will buy it for that. The X-Pro2's biggest selling point is its viewfinder The biggest selling point for the X-Pro2, however, is its viewfinder. Like the X-Pro1 and X100 series of fixed-lens cameras, the \"hybrid\" unit lets you switch between an electronic and optical viewfinder with the flick of a lever. The EVF displays what\u2019s coming through the lens and how the sensor is exposing it, making it the more useful option for critical work. The OVF, meanwhile, is a little offset from the angle of the lens, so you don\u2019t quite see exactly what the camera will capture; instead, the viewfinder superimposes bright frame lines to give an indication of your lens\u2019 field of view.\n\nWhy would you use the optical viewfinder? Well, it can be easier to use in bright light, many street photographers in particular like being able to see what\u2019s outside their frame before composing, and it\u2019s just straight-up more pleasant to look at the world than to peer through a tunnel at a screen. And with the X-Pro2, it\u2019s easier than ever to prioritize the optical view, because you can get the best of both worlds \u2014 Fujifilm has added a tiny secondary EVF to the bottom-right corner, letting you confirm accurate framing, focus, and exposure from within the OVF. It\u2019s a feature taken from the X100T, but unlike that camera you can use the secondary display to see the whole frame, rather than just a zoomed-in view of your focus point. To be clear, this is completely unique in the world of cameras. Leica is the only company that sells digital rangefinders with optical viewfinders, and those are all manual-focus models without any electronic elements in the OVF \u2014 you can\u2019t confirm that you got the right shot without reviewing images on the rear-mounted LCD. The same goes for DSLRs, which do have autofocus and a through-the-lens view but still don\u2019t let you check exposure in the viewfinder. With the X-Pro2, Fujifilm has developed a viewfinder that offers what people love about rangefinders and what they need from a professional camera all in one package. It\u2019s business and pleasure at once. The X-Pro2 isn\u2019t always Fujifilm\u2019s best pro camera The reason I\u2019m talking about the viewfinder so much is that you really, really have to want it if the X-Pro2 is going to be your next camera. Fujifilm\u2019s two-year-old flagship model, the X-T1, has an SLR-style design that houses a single electronic viewfinder \u2014 no optical option, but the EVF blows the X-Pro2\u2019s out of the water. Its magnification is much higher, so it\u2019s both a lot more immersive and far easier to use; confirming critical focus, for example, is more reliable on the X-T1 for this reason. Lenses longer than 35mm \u2014 like my beloved 56mm f/1.2 \u2014 are also kind of useless on the X-Pro2\u2019s OVF, because the framelines are so small. And I have to be honest \u2014 I\u2019ve been using the X-Pro2 as my primary camera for a couple of months, and although I feel better about using the OVF more for fun than ever before, when it comes to work I just don\u2019t trust it as much as the EVF. And that\u2019s a big reason why, despite the name, the X-Pro2 isn\u2019t always Fujifilm\u2019s best pro camera.\n\nThere are other reasons. The X-Pro2 is a step back in control density, integrating the X-T1\u2019s ISO dial into its shutter speed dial in a fiddly retro way that I never really got the hang of. I missed the dedicated switches for drive and metering modes. I really missed the tilting screen. And the X-T1\u2019s grip feels more balanced when using bigger lenses like the 56mm f/1.2. These issues were hard to ignore when, for example, I was taking portraits and scrambling in the photo pit while covering the AlphaGo match in Seoul last month. But for every snag that made me want to go back to the X-T1, the X-Pro2 takes a step forward that makes me never want to use anything else. Image quality, for example, is just phenomenal with the new 24-megapixel image sensor. Yes, I know megapixels don\u2019t count for a lot alone, but the fact that Fujifilm waited four years to increase resolution means it\u2019s been able to do so without running into the usual trade-offs. I found high-ISO performance and noise to be at least as good as the X-T1\u2019s, which is already excellent, and the increase in detail is often dramatic; it feels like the sensor the X-Series Fujinon lenses have been waiting for. JPEG rendition is better than ever, and the new Acros monochrome film simulation turns in gorgeous results right out of the camera. Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother gigantic advance is found with the \"focus stick\" on the rear of the camera. This little joystick has one purpose and one purpose only \u2014 to help you select specific autofocus points quickly and accurately, which has sometimes been awkward on previous Fujifilm cameras. It works fantastically well, with tight, solid dampening that makes honing in on a subject\u2019s eye as fun as pulling off a dragon punch in Street Fighter. On the subject of autofocus, the X-Pro2 still isn\u2019t up to DSLR-level speed, but its performance is the best in any Fujifilm camera to date \u2014 it\u2019s the first X-Series camera that really almost never frustrates me in that regard, depending on the lens attached. And this may sound silly, but the X-Pro2\u2019s shutter makes the most satisfying thk-thk-thk of any camera I\u2019ve ever heard. It helps that this is inexplicably the first X-Series model to let you take multiple shots by keeping the shutter half-pressed \u2014 previous cameras forced you to refocus or use the continuous AF mode, unlike basically every other mirrorless camera or DSLR on the planet. With its distinct physical and auditory feedback and its more intuitive performance, the X-Pro2 is by far the most responsive Fujifilm camera to date.", "description": "Fujifilm's new flagship puts passion before practicality", "authors": ["Sam Byford", "Apr"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B_7mFSPDEg8Mx5N2pNMNqAiih7Q=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13042721/DSCF3553.0.0.1461915237.jpg", "published_at": "2016-04-29"}
