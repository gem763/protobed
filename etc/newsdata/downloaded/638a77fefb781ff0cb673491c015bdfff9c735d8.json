E-trons cost from \u00a371,560, according to Audi\u2019s website.\n\nYesterday was their first joint engagement since the controversial ITV documentary in which they admitted they were struggling with the pressures of being in the spotlight. Both looked relaxed and comfortable yesterday, and Meghan, wearing a red leather-look skirt and a red V-neck jumper, even cracked a joke about Harry accompanying her.\n\nKicking off the discussion, she said: \u2018In terms of gender equality, which is something I have championed for a long time, I think that conversation can\u2019t happen without men being a part of it.\n\nAt the wheel: Harry in the electric Audi E-tron which the couple have had since \u2018about June\u2019 this year, an aide said. E-trons cost from \u00a371,560, according to Audi\u2019s website\n\n\u2018So for this reason it made complete sense to let him [Harry] join today. So thank you for letting him crash the party.\u2019\n\nMeghan convened the discussion with campaigners leading projects to empower women and girls in countries including South Africa, Nigeria, Iraq, Malawi, Bangladesh, Barbados and Grenada.\n\nThey were brought together by the Queen\u2019s Commonwealth Trust and the charity One Young World (OYW), which has been holding its international summit in London this week.\n\nMeghan, who attended the summit\u2019s opening ceremony on Tuesday, has been a counsellor for OYW since 2014 and has long championed women\u2019s empowerment. She is vice-president of the Queen\u2019s Commonwealth Trust and Harry is its president.\n\nThe royal couple during a round table discussion on gender equality with the Queen's Commonwealth Trust and One Young World at Windsor Castle\n\nYesterday Meghan said that gender equality was \u2018also very key to the way my husband feels\u2019, adding that \u2018he has been working in this space since 2013, which a lot of people don\u2019t notice as much\u2019.\n\nShe and Harry then listened to women telling their stories of how they have created projects in their home countries to empower women and girls.\n\nIn August last year, only months after his wedding to Meghan, Harry ditched his top-of-the-range Audi RS6 4.0 Avant Tiptronic Quattro \u2013 it was advertised for sale through the Auto Trader website for \u00a371,900.\n\nThe 2017-registration car, which had a top speed of 155mph, had less than 5,000 miles on the clock. The sale prompted speculation that the couple were looking for a more \u2018family friendly\u2019 vehicle.", "description": "Meghan arrived at Windsor Castle for the event on gender equality in an Audi E-tron driven by Prince Harry, half a mile from their home Frogmore Cottage on the royal estate.", "authors": ["David Wilkes For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/02/20204498-0-image-a-3_1572052660518.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
