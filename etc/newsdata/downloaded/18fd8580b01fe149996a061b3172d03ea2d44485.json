BoJo Govt Signals It Can Soften Brexit Deal in Talks", "language": "en", "text": "(AFP) \u2014 Britain hinted Sunday that it could be open to changes to its latest Brexit proposals for Northern Ireland, as European leaders piled pressure on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to revise the plans.\n\nBrexit Secretary Stephen Barclay reiterated that the ideas formally submitted to Brussels this week were \u201ca broad landing zone\u201d to be discussed during \u201cintense negotiations in the coming days\u201d.\n\nHe urged the bloc to show \u201ccreativity and flexibility\u201d to secure a deal ahead of October 31 \u2014 when Johnson has vowed Britain will end its 46 years of EU membership with or without an agreement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve set out very serious proposals including compromise on our side,\u201d Barclay told the BBC.\n\n\u201cWe do need to get into the intensive negotiations on the text to clarify what the deal is.\u201d\n\nBarclay added the government was considering holding a parliamentary vote ahead of a make-or-break EU summit on October 17-18 to show bloc leaders that Johnson\u2019s plans have MPs\u2019 support.\n\nBut European leaders, who have reacted tepidly to the propositions and urged London to offer a revised, viable way forward, are yet to agree even to ramp up negotiations.\n\nBrussels reportedly baulked at Britain\u2019s request to keep initial discussions on the proposals going through the weekend, and they will resume Monday.\n\nThe EU instead want reworked plans submitted by the end of the week, with time running out ahead of the summit.\n\n\u201cIf the offer from the UK turns out to be a take-it-or-leave-it, it\u2019s going to be very difficult,\u201d Latvian Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins told the BBC on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fully dependent on the will of Mr Johnson because from the European side, we\u2019re always open and looking towards a deal.\u201d\n\n\u2018No more dither\u2019\n\nJohnson began phoning European leaders this weekend to sell his proposals, but has so far received scant encouragement for a deal based around them.\n\nDutch Premier Mark Rutte tweeted he had told Johnson \u201cimportant questions remain about the British proposals\u201d and \u201cthere is a lot of work to be done ahead\u201d of the summit.\n\nMeanwhile the EU\u2019s top negotiator Michel Barnier told an event Saturday organised by French newspaper Le Monde that while an agreement was still possible it \u201cwill be very difficult to reach\u201d.\n\nThe British leader is hoping the threat of a messy no-deal departure in less than three weeks could force the EU to compromise.\n\nThat comes despite British MPs passing a law last month that requires him to seek another Brexit delay if he fails to secure an agreement by the end of the summit.\n\nBarclay reiterated Sunday that the government would comply with the legislation.\n\nBut in identical articles for two Brexit-backing British tabloids, Johnson insisted the country will leave the bloc later this month.\n\n\u201cThey should be under no illusions or misapprehensions,\u201d he wrote in the Sunday Express.\n\n\u201cThere will be no more dither or delay. On October 31 we are going to get Brexit done.\u201d\n\n\u2018Ready to work\u2019\n\nThe British proposals submitted to Brussels Wednesday centre on how to manage the post-Brexit border between British province Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.\n\nJohnson wants Northern Ireland\u2019s devolved assembly \u2014 which has been suspended for almost three years \u2014 to vote every four years on whether to maintain EU rather than British regulations there.\n\nHe has also proposed the province leaves the EU\u2019s customs union along with the rest of Britain, with required checks to rely on untried technology and carried out away from the sensitive border.\n\nBrussels has said the plans \u201cdo not provide a basis for concluding an agreement\u201d.\n\nIt sees the potential for rampant smuggling while Ireland is concerned hardline Northern Irish unionists would have an effective veto.\n\nBarclay, who will travel to Amsterdam later Sunday for Brexit talks, hinted that Britain could be willing to consider alternative ways of meeting its aims.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready to work on that,\u201d he said.\n\nIreland\u2019s leader Leo Varadkar said Saturday there is \u201cplenty of time\u201d to put forward alternatives and he was trying to arrange a meeting with Johnson next week, Irish broadcaster RTE reported.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "(AFP) -- Britain hinted Sunday that it could be open to changes to its latest Brexit proposals for Northern Ireland, as European leaders piled pressure on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to revise the plans.", "authors": ["Breitbart London"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Boris-Juncker-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
