(July 3) AP, AP\n\nUnder social media's eye?\n\nA couple's \"The Handmaid's Tale\"-inspired wedding photograph, featuring the bride and groom kissing beside \"handmaids\" in red robes and white bonnets and in front of \"the wall\" featured on the Hulu TV series, has gone viral.\n\n\"Praise be! Kendra & Torsten are married!\" the Wednesday post from Van Daele & Russell Photography read (the post has since been deleted). \"If there\u2019s any 'The Handmaid's Tale' fans out there, you\u2019ll know most of it is filmed in Cambridge! So, as fans of the show, it only seemed fitting for there to be some Handmaids in K&T\u2019s wedding photos along the \u2018hanging wall\u2019 in Mill Race Park!\" The TV series is based on the novel of the same name by Margaret Atwood.\n\nThe photographers are a gay married couple, Shawn Van Daele and Russell Clint.\n\nHundreds of comments poured in on the post.\n\n\"I've never in my life seen someone so incredibly dense to have missed such a huge point...... And to make the premier photo at 'the wall' no less..... Just absolutely stunned right now,\" one user wrote. Another wrote: \"Wow, this is deeply disturbing. \u201cPraise be\u201d? Seriously? I love the show, but this photo is truly puke-worthy.\"\n\nSome comments have been positive, however. \"I am obsessed with this show (and book). So cool!\" one wrote. Another said, \"Love this! Amazing shot.\"\n\nVan Daele and Russell have posted lengthy responses to some of the negative comments and have shared a statement with USA TODAY.\n\nUSA TODAY has also attempted to reach the couple in the photo for comment.\n\n\"What\u2019s sad is that everyone is reacting exactly as expected \u2013 just like in Gilead \u2013 and missing the opportunity to think for themselves, to educate themselves, to become engaged activists instead of simply keyboard warriors,\" the photographers stated, in part. \"We\u2019d love to see people out in the streets participating in women\u2019s marches, supporting equal rights for everyone regardless of their sexual orientation, and so many other important causes\u2026instead of sitting here scrolling through Instagram and knee-jerking their way through comment threads. So you\u2019re all correct \u2013 it\u2019s gross, disgusting, and a horrible concept that is rampantly becoming more \u201creal' in the world day by day and comment by comment.\"\n\n\"So many comments here are just \u201cthis is gross\u201d \u2013 but no explanation why,\" the photographers added. \"WHY exactly are you offended? Do you know? Have you asked yourself? And\u2026what are you actively doing about it IN THE REAL WORLD? We\u2019re thrilled that this is starting a conversation, especially among so many people in relationships, about to be married, or who are actually married, since the visually offensive thing here seems to be one happy couple in the midst of the oppressed. Ironic.\"\n\nYes, a sequel: Sequel to 'The Handmaid's Tale,' Margaret Atwood's 'The Testaments,' well worth the wait\n\nIn case you missed: 'The Handmaid's Tale' Season 3 finale recap: A gorgeous and completely nonsensical ending\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/03/the-handmaids-tale-wedding-photo-sparks-social-media-backlash/3852244002/", "description": "A couple's \"The Handmaid's Tale\"-inspired\u00a0wedding photograph has angered social media users.", "authors": ["David Oliver", "Published P.M.
