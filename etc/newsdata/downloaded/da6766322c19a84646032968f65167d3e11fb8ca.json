The controversy over Cho dented the popularity of Moon and his ruling party, according to recent polls, an alarming development for the liberals ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in April.\n\n\"Is President Moon Jae-in listening to people's voices only after his and his ruling party's approval ratings face the danger of a nosedive?\" the conservative Liberty Korea Party said in a statement. \"The president must apologise to the people for plunging the Republic of Korea to a chaos by appointing an unqualified minister.\"\n\nTens of thousands of opposition protesters have rallied for weeks near Seoul's presidential office calling for Cho's ouster and arrest.\n\nIn South Korea, prosecutors have exclusive authority to indict and seek warrants for criminal suspects and exercise control over police investigative activities. They can also directly initiate criminal investigations even when there's no complaint.\n\nCritics say such powers are excessive and have prompted past conservative governments to use the prosecution as a political tool to suppress opponents and carry out vendettas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe conservatives, now the opposition, say the ruling liberals are pressuring prosecutors over a legitimate criminal probe surrounding a key member of their government.\n\nIn a country grappling with widening inequality and where children toil in brutally competitive school environments, the controversy over Cho has struck a nerve and tarnished the image of Moon, who vowed to restore the public's faith in fairness and justice after winning a presidential by-election in 2017 to replace his conservative predecessor Park Geun-hye, who is jail for a corruption conviction.\n\nRecent polls indicate Moon's popularity has sank to the lowest levels since he took office. In a survey of some 1,000 South Koreans released last Friday by Gallup Korea, 51 per centy of the respondents negatively rated Moon's performance in state affairs, compared to 43 per cent who said he was doing a good job. The survey's margin of error was plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nAAP", "description": "Cho Kuk said in a statement that he was offering to resign to reduce President Moon Jae-in's political burden.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4b7057a06924b6ea01fdfc1322e94af2fd78962f", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
