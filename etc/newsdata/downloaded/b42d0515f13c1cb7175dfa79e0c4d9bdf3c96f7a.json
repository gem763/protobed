It\u2019s the main selling point that distinguishes this model from the presently-available Pure Cool and Pure Hot + Cool, which can only capture formaldehyde, not destroy it. But before you drop $649 on a formaldehyde-fighting device there are a few things that you should know.\n\nFirst, it is almost guaranteed that there is formaldehyde in your home. Formaldehyde is just about everywhere. It\u2019s a chemical that\u2019s found in your body, in the environment, and in furniture and wood products. People tend to hear about it in conjunction with health problems, and it\u2019s true \u2014 when there\u2019s enough of it in the air, formaldehyde can irritate your eyes, nose, or throat. It\u2019s also been classed as a cancer-causing substance, but as the American Cancer Society notes: \u201cthe effect of exposure to small amounts is less clear.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) agrees \u2014 \u201cMost people don\u2019t have any health problems from small amounts of formaldehyde in their homes,\u201d says a fact sheet on their website. Furniture, flooring, or fabrics, especially new items, might emit formaldehyde when they\u2019re new, but this process, called outgassing, decreases over time. The CDC says that after about two years, the chemical has mostly been released. It doesn\u2019t stick around for long, either, and will break down naturally into carbon dioxide in the air in a few hours.\n\nSome homes may have more formaldehyde present than others; according to the CDC, well-insulated homes, homes of smokers, newly-constructed homes, and homes filled with new products may have higher levels of formaldehyde. Also, the American Cancer Society says that \u201cusing unvented fuel-burning appliances, such as gas stoves, wood-burning stoves, and kerosene heaters can also raise formaldehyde levels indoors.\u201d\n\nIf you think there is a high level of formaldehyde present in your home, Dyson\u2019s new Pure Cryponic may help you \u2014 but it isn\u2019t the only option, and it\u2019s certainly not the most affordable. The American Cancer Society, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Center for Disease Control each state that you can keep formaldehyde levels low in your home by not smoking inside, regularly running fans, keeping your home cool with air conditioning, and opening your windows to let fresh air in for a few minutes every couple of days.\n\nyou\u2019ll never be able to eliminate formaldehyde completely\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to keep formaldehyde out of your home in the first place, there are some other things you can do \u2014 though you\u2019ll never be able to eliminate it completely. The CDC states that you should wash curtains before using them in your home, and setting products outside until they no longer emit a chemical-like odor. The agency also says that you can look for products with the label \u201cNo VOC/Low VOC\u201d if you want to know with certainty that it doesn\u2019t contain (or doesn\u2019t contain many) formaldehyde-producing materials. If you\u2019re building your home, you can use wood that\u2019s made to comply with formaldehyde emissions standards.\n\nThe Pure Cryptomic is the only air purifier Dyson makes that can destroy formaldehyde. But as cool as that sounds, there are other ways to reduce the formaldehyde in your home that won\u2019t cost you much money.", "description": "Dyson\u2019s new Pure Cryptomic air purifier can eliminate formaldehyde in your home, but this function comes at a high cost.
