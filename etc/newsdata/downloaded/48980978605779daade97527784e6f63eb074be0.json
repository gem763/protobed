Morgan analysts reminded investors in a market note, pointing out that Johnson is pushing for a snap election and a so-called \"hard Brexit\" remains an option.\n\nThe weak global trade outlook is also still a key worry, with U.S. President Donald Trump warning on Tuesday he would be \"tougher\" on Beijing in a second term if talks dragged on.\n\nAnd it was not clear whether Hong Kong would return to calm after leader Carrie Lam withdraw an extradition bill that triggered months of often violent protests.\n\nThat caution kept the yen's losses reasonably muted, though it did drift a little further lower to 106.42 per-dollar, its cheapest since Friday.\n\nThe yuan held on to Wednesday's gains at around 7.1487 per dollar in offshore trade.\n\nChina will implement both broad and targeted cuts in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks \"in a timely manner,\" China's cabinet said in a meeting on Wednesday, an indication that a cut in the key ratio aimed at boosting lending could be imminent.\n\n\"A drop in geopolitical risk premium comes as a welcome relief,\" said Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at AxiTrader.\n\n\"But with the omnipresent trade war clouds looming ominously over the market threatening to come thundering down at any time, the air remains thick with caution.\"", "description": "The British pound hovered around a one-week high on Thursday as another parliamentary defeat for Prime Minister Boris Johnson made investors optimistic that a no-deal Brexit could be avoided, while a broader risk-on mood held back the dollar.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105012589-Pounds_wallet_.jpg?v=1529477519"}
