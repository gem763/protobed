A larger 6.3-inch Pixel XL will start at $899.\n\nThe new devices aim to ramp up Google\u2019s challenge in the premium smartphone segment dominated by Samsung and Apple, which recently unveiled an iPhone 11 starting at $699.\n\nGoogle also updated its Nest smart home cameras and speakers and announced its streaming game service Stadia would launch November 19.\n\nWhile Pixel smartphones have struggled for traction in the smartphone market, they provide an opportunity to showcase the Android operating system\u2019s capabilities and the Google Assistant digital aide.\n\nPixel 4 features improved camera capabilities, using artificial intelligence to boost optical zoom and take better photos taken after dark, with a feature devoted to capturing images of the heavens at night.\n\nMotion-sensing technology that Google has been working on for some time is built into Pixel 4 and will allow for some basic controls, such as silencing alarms or skipping to the next song, by holding up or waving hands. The handsets also include a \u201cface unlock\u201d feature similar to those on iPhones and other devices.\n\nAmid antitrust reviews on both sides of the Atlantic over its online dominance, Google is seeking to diversify its business by adding more devices and services.\n\n\u2013 Stadia ready to go \u2013\n\nThe California-based internet titan will launch Stadia streaming game service on November 19, hoping to send console-quality play soaring into the cloud.\n\nStadia allows video game play on any internet-connected device, eliminating the need for game consoles.\n\nGoogle updated products across its hardware line, from Nest smart home devices to Chromebook laptops and wireless ear buds.\n\nA common theme was making it more natural to use Google to tap into the internet and digital assistant capabilities naturally with voice or gestures at any time.\n\nThe notion of online services and machine smarts being all around and always ready to serve people instead of needing them to tap at smartphones or keyboards is referred to as \u201cambient computing.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur vision for ambient computing is to create a single, consistent experience anywhere you go,\u201d said Rick Osterloh, head of Google\u2019s hardware division.\n\nGoogle also built digital assistant capabilities into smart home products from its Nest unit in a move that shrewdly extends its reach, according to Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi.\n\n\u201cI really felt the bigger message today was about ambient computing and how the different products work together to highlight Google\u2019s AI,\u201d Milanesi said.\n\nGoogle spotlighted product design and user privacy at the event, hitting on themes stressed by Apple as well as Microsoft, the analyst added.\n\n\u2013 Building in privacy \u2013\n\nGoogle emphasized privacy enhancements in its line of products, which kept more personal data and computing functions on devices instead of sending it to datacenters in the cloud.\n\n\u201cPrivacy is built in,\u201d Google director of product management Sabrina Ellis said while introducing Pixel 4.\n\n\u201cNew Google Assistant can respond to day-to-day requests on-device.\u201d\n\nData processed on Pixel 4 handsets is \u201cnever saved or shared with other Google services,\u201d she added.\n\nThe smartphones still need to reach into the cloud for requests such as checking whether flights are delayed or commute traffic troubled.\n\nPixel 4 users will be able to tell their devices to delete anything said to it that day or week, according to Ellis. A chip in the handset is also designed as a secure digital vault for personal data.\n\n\u201cMore and more of Google\u2019s story today is about on-device AI capabilities\u2026 it opens lots of possibilities for faster performance and better privacy,\u201d Technalysis Research chief analyst Bob O\u2019Donnell said in a tweet.\n\nGoogle also said it is ramping up investments in renewable energy, aiming to offset all the power required to make its hardware with green power.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Google-pixel-4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
