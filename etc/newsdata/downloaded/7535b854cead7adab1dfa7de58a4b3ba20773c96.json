Tucker, precious metals expert and editor of Strategic Investor, to give us a big-picture update on the and silver markets.\n\nHe was spot-on with his prediction in December that would hit $1,500 an ounce this year. Gold\u2019s up 20% this year\u2026 crossed the $1,500 barrier earlier this month\u2026 and is showing no signs of slowing down.\n\nBut what some readers may not realize is that E.B. made another important call recently. During an interview with Investing News Network at the Sprott Natural Resource Symposium in Vancouver last month, he said silver would hit $20 this year.\n\nThat\u2019s looking very likely now after silver\u2019s huge day yesterday. It\u2019s currently sitting at $18.40\u2026 up 13% from when he made the prediction.\n\nBelow, E.B. explains why both metals are still buys today.\n\nChris Reilly, managing editor, Casey Daily Dispatch: E.B., as regular readers know, you were spot-on with your \u201c$1,500 in 2019\u201d call back in December.\n\nYou recently made another call for $20 silver, which is also looking good after yesterday\u2019s run-up. What\u2019s next for silver now?\n\nE.B. Tucker, editor, Strategic Investor: Good question, and I\u2019ll get back to that a bit later\u2026 but let\u2019s actually take a closer look at my prediction first. There\u2019s something very important going on.\n\nWhere I\u2019ve had the most success over my career is when I was able to get the big picture right. Once you get the big picture right, you don\u2019t have to really do anything except stay put in the trade. It\u2019s very easy. For instance, when I got the big picture right on rental property back in early 2009, at the height of the housing crisis, I didn\u2019t have to start flipping rental property. I just had to buy rental property and watch it go up in price. I still own it today.\n\nI got the big picture right in . And so far, all you have to do is put the trade on and watch.\n\nI think people need to be very careful right now of their thinking with . A lot of people have been involved in gold before and are burned out\u2026 and they don\u2019t believe that this move in gold is real. And what they\u2019re going to do is sell at the first sign of life. And then, the price will keep running higher, and they\u2019ll wait to get back in. And they\u2019ll end up kicking themselves and buying in later at much higher prices.\n\nDon\u2019t do that. If this is a true bull market in , you don\u2019t want to watch it run away from you.\n\nWhen I made the first call for $1,500 , it was December of 2018. Gold was at $1,237 at the time\u2026 down 35% from its 2011 peak.\n\nAnd I stuck to that call throughout this year. In January, I sat back down with the same reporter at Kitco, and she asked me if I was willing to double down on that call. I said yes. I sat down again in March with at $1,300. Yes, I was still calling for $1,500. I sat down again in May, about a week before gold prices took off, and the reporter asked me once again, \u201cAre you willing to stay with this?\u201d Once again, I said yes.\n\nI saw the setup. It was easy. Sure enough, 10 days later, it took off. It\u2019s at $1,550 today. It\u2019s a big move. Now, Chris, it\u2019s important for you to understand that people still don\u2019t believe it. They truly don\u2019t believe that this rally is real. I\u2019ve been all over Canada for meetings this month. I\u2019m very connected in the gold business. No one thinks it\u2019s real, but it is.\n\nChris: Why do you think people are doubting it?\n\nE.B.: One of the reasons why is because Canadian investment bankers have been doing billions of dollars\u2019 worth of deals in the cannabis and blockchain businesses. And yes, business has been great for these guys. And the sector has been absolutely dead since 2013. In fact, it\u2019s been barbecued\u2026 and the fire went out and everybody abandoned it. And so, people see gold shoot up $250\u2026 over 20%\u2026 and they think, \u201cAh. This is gold, though. Nobody buys gold anymore. It\u2019s over.\u201d Now that\u2019s what you call apathy.\n\nAnd when you see apathy, you want to pay close attention, because apathy is a great sign that something big could be around the bend.\n\nIt sounds strange to say it that way, but in markets, people tend to be overly enthusiastic at the top of a bubble \u2013 and have apathy at the bottom when things are dirt cheap. You see it a lot when something is shooting higher to an irrational price. Take, for instance, our bitcoin call back in late 2017. As you know, bitcoin was soaring, and just days before it reached its all-time high, we told our readers to recoup their initial investment. It went on to fall 84% over the next year. This was at the same time that my son\u2019s nanny asked, \u201cMr. E.B., should I get the bitcoin?\u201d\n\nEveryone was enthusiastic at that point. Even nannies were enthusiastic, and no disrespect to nannies, but typically, they\u2019re not on the frontlines of new investment trends.\n\nChris: Good point.\n\nE.B.: So you see what I mean\u2026 The masses tend to be really enthusiastic at the wrong time. And then, when something is a good deal, people don\u2019t believe it. For example, when I was buying rental houses in 2009 and 2010, I had a really arrogant guy in my town, a wounded real estate developer, who ridiculed me during dinner one night for doing what I was doing. He asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t I read the newspaper and see that there had just been a housing crisis?\u201d\n\nMy point with all of this is that it\u2019s important to look at people\u2019s sentiment. And in , that\u2019s apathy. And so, it tells us that gold\u2019s going to have to prove them wrong and demand their attention, which probably means another $200 jump.\n\nBut I\u2019m more excited about silver in the short run.\n\nChris: What do you like about silver right now?\n\nE.B.: Silver is historically very cheap right now compared to . And when the gold move took off, like I just explained, and nobody paid attention to it, nobody paid attention to silver, either.\n\nBut I saw a big move coming, as you mentioned earlier. After I made the $1,500 call on Kitco, I made a \u201c$20 silver\u201d call afterward. And that\u2019s looking very good as well.\n\nOne reason we like silver so much is because of the gold-to-silver ratio, which tells you how many ounces of silver it takes to buy one ounce of .\n\nIn June, broke out to six-year highs. Gold rose 8% in June while silver sat flat. This helped push the gold-to-silver ratio to a 26-year high of 93 on July 3 \u2013 an extreme. This means it took 93 ounces of silver to buy one ounce of gold.\n\nHowever, we\u2019ve been calling for a 75-to-one ratio against , and we\u2019re almost there. It\u2019s at 84 today. A 75-to-one ratio puts silver at $20 an ounce.\n\nWe think it\u2019s a reasonable ratio for the price of silver to the price of in the short run, and that assumes gold stays at around $1,500 and silver goes to $20, which is very likely now.\n\nIn short, we think silver has a lot of catching up to do, in regards to this crucial ratio. With up 21% since its May low, silver hasn\u2019t moved as expected until very recently. Silver usually propels farther faster than gold in a bull market.\n\nNow, with silver prices up only 28% since May, a swift price rally could catch the market off-guard. As we\u2019ve been saying, we think is in the early innings of a long-term rally, but silver could prove to have more explosive gains over the next few months.\n\nWe think this is only the beginning of what may go down as the mother of all metals rallies.\n\nChris: Are you seeing anything else that tells you this silver run is the real deal, like you\u2019re saying about gold?\n\nE.B.: Definitely. I\u2019ve been involved in several bull markets. Typically, what happens is, let\u2019s say gold goes up 1% in a day. Silver will go up 2%. And it\u2019s typically the case in the opposite direction, too. So silver tends to be much more volatile than gold in both directions, higher or lower. But in this recent run, where gold was at $1,500, silver was performing less than gold, so that tells you that there\u2019s zero speculative interest in silver\u2026 yet it\u2019s still been climbing higher. And at some point soon, the speculative interest will be there.\n\nBuying silver right now is truly a layup trade.\n\nChris: Great stuff, E.B. So how can our readers take advantage of this rally?\n\nE.B.: Well, if you don\u2019t have any physical silver, then I would say that it\u2019s a bit reckless to go out and buy a bunch of silver mining stocks, unless you\u2019re just a trader.\n\nSo first, you may want to look into owning at least some physical silver. Just like with , physical coins are a good starting point because they represent a real, hold-in-your-hand asset. That\u2019s opposed to a mining stock which represents a share of a company\u2019s future profits.\n\nBut you\u2019re going to see the biggest returns in the silver mining stocks.\n\nI\u2019ve been in this market a long time. Each time it starts to take off, people ask me what mining stocks to buy. We cover what I think are the best mining stocks in Strategic Investor. Shares of our key silver miner shot up over 50% from their May low to a 52-week high yesterday. If silver prices keep moving, shares could too.\n\nI am not a fan of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) when it comes to buying mining stocks. Sure, they\u2019re easy to buy and sell instantly, but if you dig deep, they own a lot of companies I don\u2019t want to touch. All mining firms are not created equal. This is one sector where it pays to own the best.\n\nAs we always say, when speculating on miners, always do your research before buying any stock, and never bet more money than you can afford to lose. These stocks tend to be very volatile.\n\nChris: Got it. So readers should start with owning physical silver, and then consider speculating on the best-of-breed silver miners. Is there another way readers can get easy exposure to silver today?\n\nE.B.: One alternative play that I think is trustworthy is the Sprott Physical Silver Trust, a silver bullion fund. Ticker PSLV. This is a way to get exposure to physical silver instead of a basket of silver miners. It\u2019s a good place to start.\n\nChris: Perfect. Thanks, E.B. Always a pleasure.\n\nE.B.: Same here. Talk soon.\n\nSilver Is Ready To Take Out Key Levels\n\nSilver is now ready to follow and successfully signal its bull market. In fact, it is important that silver do so, in order to provide another confirmation that gold\u2019s recent rally is \u201creal\u201d.\n\nThe following technique could provide a way to track silver until it provides that clear bull market signal.\n\nSilver Futures Monthly Chart Silver Futures Monthly Chart\n\nBelow, is a long-term silver chart:\n\nOn the chart, I have marked two patterns 1 to 5, to show how the current period is similar to the period circa 1983.\n\nIf the comparison to the 1980s pattern is justified, and the current pattern continues in a similar fashion, by breaking down at the red line, then silver will continue in a long bear market. If the current fractal diverge from the 80s fractal by breaking out at the green line, then the bull market will resume with vigor.\n\nSilver has now made significant moves over the last couple of months, and appears ready to confirm the bull market.\n\nSilver Futures Monthly Chart Silver Futures Monthly Chart\n\nOnce it breaks through the above key levels, it would confirm that it follows this pattern, below:\n\nIt still has a lot of work to do, but this is likely to happen quickly now. The stock market is still near all-time highs, and is looking very vulnerable to a massive collapse. This will provide the acceleration that silver needs to move even faster. \u2013 Hubert Moolman\n\nTraders could look to silver as another way to ride the upswing in prices\n\nOver the last six months, prices have jumped nearly 30% amid concerns over global growth, with its cheaper sister metal following close behind\n\nOngoing concerns over global growth and market volatility have been good news for one of the world\u2019s oldest \u2018safe\u2019 assets, .\n\nEscalating risks to international trade and the likely impact of tariffs on growth and inflation have sent investors scrambling for the yellow metal, which over the last 12 months has surged nearly 29% to US$1,542 an ounce, highs not seen since 2011, the deep point of the European sovereign debt crisis.\n\nAnd the high tide of prices appears here to stay, at least according to analysts at UBS, who said in a note on Wednesday that the persistent uncertainty was likely to keep gold \u201cwell supported\u201d going forward.\n\nThe Swiss investment bank also saw \u201cample room\u201d for prices of the yellow stuff to rise even further as they remained low in comparison to the decade high of July 2011 when hit US$1,838 an ounce.\n\n\u201cWe continue to see rallying to as high as US$1,600 between now and year-end, albeit with a potential pit stop around US$1,580\u201d, UBS said.\n\nThe bank added that recent headlines concerning a de-escalation in trade tensions between the US and China, which have rocked the world\u2019s stock markets over the past year, have not been enough to trigger a decline in the price, suggesting that there is a \u201crelatively high threshold\u201d for easing investor\u2019s concerns over the global economy.\n\nMeanwhile, silver, gold\u2019s less expensive sister, has been having a rally of its own, rising 29% to US$18.4 an ounce, as traders are increasingly drawn to the metal as a cheaper method of capitalising on gold\u2019s upswing.\n\nUBS said this idea was \u201ceven more attractive\u201d considering that silver had been lagging behind recently and the metal would be \u201cdragged higher\u201d, adding that they expected silver to hover around US$18 an ounce in the short-term with risk \u201cskewed to the upside\u201d.\n\nAnalysts also said that \u201cmore substantial easing\u201d by the US Federal Reserve, which is currently under pressure to cut interest rates again having already done so in July, would provide a \u201cclear upside catalyst\u201d for silver, and with current macro-economic developments this risk was rising.\n\nThe prospect of more central bank intervention in foreign exchange markets, with China having devalued the renminbi against the US dollar earlier this month, was also likely to boost the price of .\n\nHowever, the bank remained skeptical that silver could end up outperforming its more expensive sibling given the slowdown in global growth and an \u201celevated\u201d risk environment.\n\nThe relationship between and silver prices\n\nPrices of and silver tend to move in tandem in the commodities markets, rising and falling more or less in sync, however, this is not always the case\n\nIn this case, traders often look to the gold/silver ratio, which aims to reflect fluctuations in the price of and silver relative to each other.\n\nPut simply, the gold/silver ratio charts how many ounces of silver it takes to purchase one ounce of .\n\nIf the ratio is 50 to one, it will take 50 ounces of silver to buy one ounce of , a high ratio (e.g 100 to one) indicates that gold\u2019s value is up, whereas a lower ratio (50 to one or lower) shows that silver\u2019s value is up.\n\nJoni Teves, a UBS strategist, says that given the high positive correlation between the two metals, the ratio serves as a \u201csignal\u201d that something is causing them to move more significantly relative to each other, which helps traders determine whether to buy or sell either of them.\n\nShe adds that some traders can even trade the ratio itself, betting on whether the value of or silver will move up to down relative to its sibling.\n\nAs of 28 August, the gold/silver ratio stands at 84 to one, indicating that 84 ounces of silver will buy one ounce of , a relatively high ratio suggesting that silver\u2019s ascent is stopping slightly short of the gold rally. \u2013 Calum Muirhead", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Commodity Trade Mantra  covering: XAU/USD, Gold Futures.
