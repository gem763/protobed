Because Trudeau\u2019s Liberals won 156 seats (maybe even 157) in Monday\u2019s federal election, which is not quite enough to form a majority government \u2014 only a minority.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nIt means Trudeau\u2019s going to have to take his cues from Sesame Street and start singing the cooperation song.\n\nHe didn\u2019t go so far as to ask for help in his speech from Montreal on Monday night, but his tone was business-like.\n\n\u201cTonight, you\u2019re sending us back to work for you,\u201d Trudeau said, addressing Canadians. \u201cWe take this responsibility seriously.\u201d\n\nWhat is a minority government?\n\nWhen one party wins more than half of the 338 ridings (or electoral districts) in the country \u2014 at least 170 seats \u2014 the leader of that party gets to be the prime minister. Easy peasy.\n\nBut if all of the parties fall short of the halfway mark, things get more complicated.\n\nIn that case, the party with the most seats might try to form a partnership with another party in order to run the country together.\n\nAs of 10 a.m. ET, there was still one riding that was undecided. The Liberals are leading in that riding, so their total seat count could go up to 157.\n\nHow did Canadian kids vote?\n\nFor the most part, kids and adults seem to be on the same wavelength this election.\n\nIn a mock student vote, which allowed more than a million students across the country to cast pretend ballots, the Liberals won 110 seats, which would also allow them to form a minority government.\n\nIn the student vote, which was organized by a national charity called CIVIX, the NDP came in second place, followed by the Conservatives.\n\nInterestingly, in the adult vote, although the Conservatives didn\u2019t win the most seats, they did win the highest percentage of the vote, with the Liberals coming in second.\n\nIn the student vote, the Conservatives also won the highest percentage of the vote, but the Liberals came in third place, after the NDP.\n\nNDP leader Jagmeet Singh and his wife, Gurkiran Kaur, celebrate winning 24 seats on election night. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press)\n\nBecause minority governments require cooperation to make them work, they often don\u2019t last more than two years.\n\nIn his speech on Monday night, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said he was putting Trudeau on notice.\n\n\u201cWhen your government falls, Conservatives will be ready and we will win,\u201d he said.\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer said his party would be ready to win if Trudeau\u2019s government falls.
