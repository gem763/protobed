(AP) \u2014 The world\u2019s first female spacewalking team made history high above Earth on Friday, floating out of the International Space Station to fix a broken part of the power network.\n\nAs NASA astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir emerged one by one, it marked the first time in a half-century of spacewalking that a woman floated out without a male crewmate.\n\nAmerica\u2019s first female spacewalker from 35 years ago, Kathy Sullivan, was delighted. She said It\u2019s good to finally have enough women in the astronaut corps and trained for spacewalking for this to happen.\n\nNASA leaders \u2014 along with women and others around the world \u2014 cheered Koch and Meir on. At the same time, many noted that this will hopefully become routine in the future.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got qualified women running the control, running space centers, commanding the station, commanding spaceships and doing spacewalks,\u201d Sullivan told The Associated Press earlier this week. \u201cAnd golly, gee whiz, every now and then there\u2019s more than one woman in the same place.\u201d\n\nTracy Caldwell Dyson, a three-time spacewalker who watched from Mission Control, added: \u201cHopefully, this will now be considered normal.\u201d\n\nNASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine watched the big event unfold from NASA headquarters in Washington.\n\n\u201cWe have the right people doing the right job at the right time,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are an inspiration to people all over the world including me. And we\u2019re very excited to get this mission underway.\u201d\n\nNASA originally wanted to conduct an all-female spacewalk last spring, but did not have enough medium-size suits ready to go. Koch and Meir were supposed to install more new batteries in a spacewalk next week, but had to venture out three days earlier to deal with an equipment failure that occurred over the weekend. They need to replace an old battery charger for one of the three new batteries that was installed last week by Koch and Andrew Morgan.\n\n\u201cJessica and Christina, we are so proud of you. You\u2019re going to do great today,\u201d Morgan radioed from inside as the women exited the hatch.\n\nMeir, making her spacewalking debut, became the 228th person in the world to conduct a spacewalk and the 15th woman.\n\nIt was the fourth spacewalk for Koch, who is seven months into an 11-month mission that will be the longest ever by a woman.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
