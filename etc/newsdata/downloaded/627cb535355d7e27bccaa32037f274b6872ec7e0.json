It was formalised through the 1961 Vienna convention on diplomatic relations (VCDR) which was incorporated into domestic law by the 1964 Diplomatic Privileges Act. The reciprocal global agreements also protect UK diplomats working abroad.\n\nHow far does it extend?\n\nAs well as covering diplomats and their families anywhere in the UK, the same convention and legislation prevents UK officials from entering diplomatic premises. That inviolability enabled Julian Assange to stay in the Ecuadorian embassy in London for seven years. (His stay was not the longest: a Hungarian archbishop spent 15 years sheltering inside the US embassy in Budapest.)\n\nCan it be cancelled?\n\nWithout a foreign state agreeing to lift immunity, diplomats and their dependent families can only be detained \u201cas a last resort\u201d if, for example, they are deemed to be a danger to others or themselves. The only other sanction available to the Foreign Office would be to order their expulsion.\n\nDoes it apply to diplomats outside London?\n\nAccording to the Crown Prosecution Service, the immunity does not apply to dependants of consular officials based outside London. However, it is understood that some diplomatic staff and their spouses located outside the capital can get that immunity.\n\nWhat is a waiver?\n\nWhen a foreign state agrees to remove that legal protection, it is known as a \u201cwaiver of immunity\u201d. Individual diplomats cannot do so; the embassy of the foreign state has to make a formal request.\n\nDo resident diplomats have to obey the law?\n\nDiplomats are supposed to behave responsibly. The Vienna convention states: \u201cWithout prejudice to their privileges and immunities, it is the duty of all persons enjoying such privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving state. They also have a duty not to interfere in the internal affairs of that state.\u201d\n\nWhat is America\u2019s approach to lifting immunity?\n\nA US embassy spokesperson has said: \u201cImmunity is rarely waived.\u201d A parliamentary question in 2016 revealed a table of embassies that had incurred the largest debts through ignoring the London congestion charge. US diplomats were the No 1 offenders by a long distance, with 89,308 unpaid fines totalling \u00a310,626,970. Japan came second with 59,533 unpaid fines amounting to a denied liability of \u00a37,072,020.", "description": "Spotlight on protection for foreign diplomats after death of Harry Dunn in accident involving a US diplomat\u2019s wife", "authors": ["Owen Bowcott", "Martin Kettle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/801b4a9fc900170a71e13996c3944ff696fd0ae1/0_350_7250_4351/master/7250.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f8392e645dcc7b584d90f7ef0adc8949", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
