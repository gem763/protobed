Well, players like Le Roux, Makazole Mapimpi and Faf de Klerk have their detractors for varying reasons, but they have also been very much part of Erasmus\u2019s first-team fabric in recent weeks, and he has rooted for continuity in this first \u201cKO\u201d fixture.\n\nOne additional thought: it is a shame in some ways that tearaway loosie and ex-Sevens dynamo Kwagga Smith doesn\u2019t crack the 23, as he would have provided additional stealth in an impromptu backline capacity in the event of truly chaotic disruption affecting that department.\n\nThe big hope will be that that doesn\u2019t even remotely occur ...\n\nTeams:\n\nJapan\n\nTBA\n\nSouth Africa\n\n15 Willie le Roux, 14 Cheslin Kolbe, 13 Lukhanyo Am, 12 Damian de Allende, 11 Makazole Mapimpi, 10 Handre Pollard, 9 Faf de Klerk, 8 Duane Vermeulen, 7 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 6 Siya Kolisi (captain), 5 Lood de Jager, 4 Eben Etzebeth, 3 Frans Malherbe, 2 Bongi Mbonambi, 1 Tendai Mtawarira\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Malcolm Marx, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Vincent Koch, 19 RG Snyman, 20 Franco Mostert, 21 Francois Louw, 22 Herschel Jantjies, 23 Frans Steyn\n\n*Follow our chief writer on Twitter: @RobHouwing", "description": "Frans Steyn being the only Bok outside back substitute for the \u201cQF\u201d clearly indicates the brains trust are content with his conditioning, says <strong>Rob Houwing</strong>.", "authors": ["Rob Houwing", "Chief Writer"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9486/2299122b32c740588f40e76739778c55.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
