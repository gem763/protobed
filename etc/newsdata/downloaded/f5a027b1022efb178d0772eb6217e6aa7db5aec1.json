Israel\u2019s president has been meeting with all the parliamentary factions before choosing his candidate for prime minister, the person he'd think would be most likely to form a coalition successfully, after a deadlocked repeat election made forming any new government a daunting task.\n\nDuring last week\u2019s unpreceded second election in a year, neither of the top candidates appeared to secure the support of a majority of 61 members of the 120-seat parliament, with Gantz\u2019s party winning 33 seats and Netanyahu\u2019s securing 31 seats. Neither could assemble a parliamentary majority with its traditional smaller allies.\n\nNETANYAHU'S CHIEF RIVAL, GANTZ, REJECTS PM'S APPEAL FOR UNITY GOVERNMENT IN ISRAEL\n\nThe Arab-led bloc known as the Joint List came out of Tuesday\u2019s election as the third-largest party with 13 seats.\n\nThe decision of the Joint List on Sunday to endorse Gantz marked the first time Arab parties have endorsed a mainstream Zionist politician since 1992, when they recommended Labor Party leader Yitzhak Rabin, who campaigned on peace with the Palestinians, The Times of Israel reported.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the most difficult election since 1948 in terms of the incitement against Israel\u2019s Arab citizens,\u201d Joint List leader Ayman Odeh reportedly told Rivlin when he declared his party\u2019s recommendation. \u201cWe have been turned into a group that is not legitimate in Israeli politics. If we are being pushed out, we will take our rightful place. For us, the most important thing is to remove Benjamin Netanyahu from power.\u201d\n\nNETANYAHU APPEALS TO DIRECT RIVAL TO FORM UNITY GOVERNMENT AS PROSPECT OF THIRD ELECTION LOOMS\n\nHe added, \u201cSo we will recommend Benny Gantz to form the next government.\u201d\n\nMaverick politician Avigdor Liberman, the head of the mid-sized Yisrael Beitenu party, is considered the key power broker, with the eight seats his party captured. Last week\u2019s elections took place because Netanyahu was unable to form a coalition without Liberman's support after the election five months earlier.\n\nThe former Netanyahu ally-turned-rival refrained from endorsing either candidate during his party\u2019s consultations with the Israeli president on Sunday, so with the support from the Arab parties, Gantz anticipated he\u2019ll have 57 backers to Netanyahu\u2019s 55.\n\nHowever, later Sunday, Liberman tweeted in Hebrew that Gantz called him in the evening, requested that the two leaders meet and scheduled the meeting for Monday afternoon in Tel Aviv.\n\nNETANYAHU CANCELS UN TRIP, FORGOES MEETING WITH TRUMP AFTER FAILING TO SECURE AN OUTRIGHT VICTORY IN NATIONAL ELECTIONS\n\nWith neither Blue and White nor Likud having a clear path to a government without the Yisrael Beitenu party, Liberman was demanding a broad unity government with the two major parties, excluding the ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties. The unity government seemed to be the emerging compromise between Blue and White and Likud, though Gantz and Netanyahu both have insisted on leading it.\n\nComplicating the situation, Gantz has refused to sit with Netanyahu, the longest-serving leader in Israeli history, because Netanyahu has faced a likely indictment on corruption charges. Netanyahu\u2019s pre-indictment hearing is scheduled in two weeks, after which he could face charges of bribery, breach of trust and fraud in three separate cases.\n\nThe Arab-led parties have never sat in an Israeli government and Odeh said he\u2019s planning to become an opposition leader in the likely case of a unity government.\n\n\u201cBenny Gantz is not our cup of tea,\u201d Arab lawmaker Ahmad Tibi said. \u201cWe have criticism of him from here \u2019til tomorrow.\u201d\n\nTibi added, \u201cBut we promised our constituents that we would do everything to topple Netanyahu and the default here is recommending Benny Gantz.\"\n\nThe senior Arab Israeli lawmaker also reportedly said Sunday that the results of Israel\u2019s election also marked a blow to President Trump, who had stood strong with the leader of more than a decade.\n\n\u201cThe result is a slap in the face not [just] of Netanyahu but also President Trump, who supports all the racism, all the atrocities and is preparing the most anti-Palestinian plan that has even been presented by the U.S.,\u201d The Times of Israel reported Tibi said.\n\nHe added, \u201cMr. Trump, keep your deal.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration had said a Middle East peace plan would be released after the election.\n\nEven though the Arab-led bloc is expected to stay out of Gantz\u2019s future potential government, the endorsement highlighted a growing desire of Israel\u2019s large Arab minority to take a more active role in shaping the country.\n\nIn an op-ed piece in the New York Times published on Sunday, titled, \u201cWe are Ending Netanyahu\u2019s Grip on Israel,\u201d Odeh argued that his move should end Netanyahu\u2019s political career and provide a turning point for Israel\u2019s Arab minority.\n\n\u201cIf the center-left parties of Israel believe that Arab Palestinian citizens have a place in this country, they must accept that we have a place in its politics,\u201d Odeh wrote.\n\nISRAELI EXIT POLLS SHOW NETANYAHU SHORT OF MAJORITY IN YEAR'S SECOND ELECTION\n\nNetanyahu condemned the Joint List\u2019s endorsement of his rival for prime minister in a video statement on Sunday.\n\nIn the video, posted on his Facebook page, Netanyahu said, \u201cCitizens of Israel, this happened just as we had warned: the Arab Joint List recommended Benny Gantz for prime minister.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cNow there are two options: either a minority government will be formed that relies on those who deny Israel as a Jewish and democratic state and glorify terrorists that murder our soldiers and citizens, or a broad national government will be formed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what the answer is and so do you. And therefore I will do everything I can to form a broad national unity government,\u201d Netanyahu said in the video. \u201cThere is no other solution.\u201d\n\nRivlin has until Oct. 2 to task a lawmaker with forming a government. The president typically has appointed the candidate with the greatest number of supporters, but not necessarily. Given the unprecedented nature of this election and the tricky arithmetic involved, Rivlin would have wide discretion at his disposal in making his choice.\n\nWhen opening his series of meetings on Sunday, Rivlin didn\u2019t indicate which way he was leaning, but said he believed the people of Israel were yearning for a \u201cstable\u201d government.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned over the years that the people are less concerned about who runs the system,\u201d Rivlin said. \u201cThey first of all want the system to create a stable government. And there can\u2019t be a stable government without the two big parties.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRivlin\u2019s pick will have up to six weeks to assemble a government and if that person fails, the president can appoint another candidate, who will get up to four weeks, officials have said. If that person were to be unsuccessful, new elections would be triggered once again.\n\nRivlin has said he will do everything possible to avoid an unprecedented third election within a year.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The Arab bloc in Israel\u2019s parliament broke with tradition and recommended Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz for prime minister on Sunday, paving the way for the centrist party to get the first chance to assemble a coalition instead of incumbent Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s conservative Likud party.", "authors": ["Talia Kaplan", "Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
