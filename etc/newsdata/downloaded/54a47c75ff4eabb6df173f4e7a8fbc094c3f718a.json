Johnson decided to make a quick trip to the restroom before they headed home. \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen [Trump] that whole entire night,\u201d said Johnson, who was in her late thirties at the time. \u201cI was just walking to the bathroom. I was grabbed and pulled behind a tapestry, and it was him. And I\u2019m a tall girl and I had six-inch heels on, and I still remember looking up at him. And he\u2019s strong, and he just kissed me,\u201d she recounted to us. \u201cI was so scared because of who he was. ... I don\u2019t even know where it came from. I didn\u2019t have a say in the matter.\u201d\n\nJohnson said Trump then grabbed her and said: \u201cYou have to help me greet these guests out\u201d.\n\nHe reportedly explained that Melania was upstairs.\n\n\u201cSo I stood next to him while he greeted some guests out the door,\u201d Johnson said. She says she did not show her uncomfort as she didn\u2019t want to create an awkward situation.\n\n\u201cI was afraid to say what had happened,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know how it happened.\u201d\n\nJohnson is at least the 23rd woman to come forward with an on-record account of sexual misconduct allegedly committed by Trump. Many of those women came forward following the October 2016 release of the Access Hollywood hot mic tape in which Trump was recorded bragging about groping women and kissing them without their consent.\n\n\u201cWhen he says that thing, \u2018Grab them in the pussy,\u2019 that hits me hard because when he grabbed me and pulled me into the tapestry, that\u2019s where he grabbed me.\"\n\nThe excerpt notes that Johnson\u2019s account of the evening is corroborated by \u201cdocumentation and photographs,\u201d as well as by a friend who Johnson told about the assault years before Trump ran for president. Johnson is at least the fourth woman to accuse Trump of sexual assault at Mar-a-Lago, following Jill Hearth, Cathy Heller, and Natasha Stoynoff.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied all of the accusations against him that have previously surfaced.", "description": "The excerpt notes that Johnson\u2019s account of the evening is corroborated by \u201cdocumentation and photographs,\u201d as well as by a friend who Johnson told about the assault years before Trump ran for president.
