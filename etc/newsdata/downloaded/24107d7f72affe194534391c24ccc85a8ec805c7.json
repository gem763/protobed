Sacoolas, who is married to U.S. diplomat Jonathan Sacoolas, later fled the U.K. for the U.S. and claimed diplomatic immunity, preventing her from facing charges in the case \u2015 to the upset of Dunn\u2019s family.\n\nPres.

I believe it was going down the wrong way because that happens in Europe. You go to Europe and the roads are opposite. And it\u2019s very tough if you\u2019re from the U.S. ... That happens to a lot of people by the way,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump previously called the teen\u2019s death a \u201cterrible accident,\u201d which he said \u201chappens.\u201d\n\nCarlo Allegri / Reuters Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles, parents of British teen Harry Dunn who was killed in a car crash on his motorcycle, attend a news conference in New York on Monday.\n\n\u201cWhen you get used to one (driving) system and then you\u2019re all of a sudden on the other system where you\u2019re driving, it happens. You have to be careful,\u201d the president told reporters last week.\n\nDunn\u2019s family has traveled to the U.S. to plead with American officials to reconsider Sacoolas\u2019 diplomatic immunity, a legal shield that diplomats and their families have from host country laws during foreign service.\n\nHis parents said on Tuesday they were unpleasantly caught off guard when they arrived at the White House for what they thought would be a meeting with an administration official. Instead, they were told they would be meeting Trump, and that Sacoolas was in the building and willing to meet with them.\n\nA family spokesperson said Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, hoped they\u2019d hug it out for media photos.\n\nNorthamptonshire Police Harry Dunn, 19, was killed after his motorcycle collided with a vehicle that authorities said was driving on the wrong side of the road.\n\nTrump \u201csaid he was sorry about Harry and then he sprung the surprise that Mrs. Sacoolas was in another room in the building and whether we want to meet her there and then,\u201d Tim Dunn said. \u201cWe said no, because as we\u2019ve been saying from the start we want to meet Mrs. Sacoolas, but we want to do it in the U.K. so the police can interview her.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be sort of railroaded, not into a circus as such, but a meeting we weren\u2019t prepared for,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump and O\u2019Brien have said they have ruled out Sacoolas\u2019 return to Britain.", "description": "The president again made excuses for American Anne Sacoolas, who fled the U.K. after the crash that killed motorcyclist Harry Dunn, 19.", "authors": ["Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da74ce9200000ba0c505e2d.jpeg?cache=lbhpmvwn21&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
