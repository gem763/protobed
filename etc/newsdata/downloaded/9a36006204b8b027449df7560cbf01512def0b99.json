More than half of Sydney's home borrowers are struggling to service their mortgages, with people in this category owing $765,000 as wages growth remains weak\n\nIn just three decades, household debt to income levels in Australia have tripled - surging from just 60 per cent in 1988.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia played down the debt crisis on Tuesday as it explained why it cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points in October to a new record-low of 0.75 per cent.\n\n'Although household debt was still considered high, members saw only a limited risk of excessive borrowing at the current juncture,' it said in the minutes of its last board meeting.\n\nBizarrely, the Reserve Bank said weak wages growth reduced the risk of Australians taking on debt they couldn't afford.\n\n'Household disposable income growth (and thus borrowing capacity) is weak,' it said.\n\nIt also cited double-digit falls in Sydney and Melbourne property prices since 2017, arguing this had made borrowers cautious.\n\nIn just three decades, household debt to income levels in Australia have tripled to 190 per cent. Despite this, the Reserve Bank (Governor Philip Lowe pictured) played down the debt crisis on Tuesday as it explained why it cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points in October to a new record-low of 0.75 per cent\n\n'The memory of recent housing price falls is still fresh; and banks are still quite cautious in their appetite to lend,' the RBA said.\n\n'Nonetheless, members assessed that close monitoring of this risk was warranted.'\n\nDigital Finance Analytics principal Martin North, an economist, said the central bank's language playing down debt levels was dangerous and short-sighted.\n\n'I am pretty astonished by their relaxed attitudes to the amount of debt in the system,' he told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday.\n\n'They have got a bit of a myopic view of this.'\n\nMr North said it appeared the Reserve Bank was seeking to boost borrowing levels in a bid to revive economic activity, which is at the slowest pace since the global financial crisis a decade ago.\n\nThis approach, however, could backfire should there be another GFC.\n\n'It is quite dangerous,' Mr North said.\n\nOver a cliff: Sydney's struggling home borrowers owe an average of $765,400\n\n'They're ignoring the real risks, particularly if we have an international crisis, recession in the US.\n\n'The fundamental philosophical viewpoint that is underpinning what they're doing is so deeply flawed.'\n\nAnother government agency, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, calculated that 51 per cent of Sydney home borrowers were over indebted.\n\nThese struggling people owed an average of $765,400 on their home loan.\n\n'There is an absolute limit to the amount of debt that households are able to deal with - we've probably passed that already,' Mr North said.\n\n'Within incomes flat, and with costs of living rising, their ability to service the debt is going to deteriorate further.'\n\nAustralian wage levels have grown at below-average rates, of under three per cent, for six years.", "description": "Australia has the world's second-highest debt levels after Switzerland.
