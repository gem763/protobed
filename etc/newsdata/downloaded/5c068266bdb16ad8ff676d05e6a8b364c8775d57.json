Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) took direct aim at twice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in a scathing op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, stressing that she is running for president in order to \u201cundo Mrs. Clinton\u2019s failed legacy.\u201d\n\nGabbard, who has been in the thick of a contentious back and forth with the former Trump challenger, ripped Clinton in a scathing op-ed, harkening back to the former secretary of state\u2019s \u201cforeign-policy catastrophes\u201d and citing them as a \u201cprimary\u201d reason for her resignation as vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2016. Gabbard, as she has alluded before, said Clinton and her allies have never forgiven her for backing Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in 2016, adding, \u201cthe smears have been nonstop ever since.\u201d\n\n\u201cHardly a week goes by when I\u2019m not asked a question about how I\u2019m being secretly backed by Russia or other foreign powers\u2014on top of countless other falsehoods intended to destroy my reputation,\u201d Gabbard wrote, asserting that \u201cthose who are indebted to the war machine and the overreaching intelligence agencies, as well as their cheerleaders in the media\u201d are hellbent on taking her down because \u201cthey know they can\u2019t control me.\u201d\n\nShe continued:\n\nThis isn\u2019t a petty \u201cspat\u201d between Mrs. Clinton and me. It\u2019s a serious contrast in views about the choice voters face as they decide which Democratic candidate is best equipped to defeat President Trump. Mrs. Clinton already lost to Mr. Trump once. Why would Democrats think a Hillary 2.0 candidate would result in anything different? Whether Mrs. Clinton\u2019s name is on the ballot or not, her foreign policy will be, as many of the Democratic candidates adhere to her doctrine of acting as the world\u2019s police, using the tools of war to overthrow governments we don\u2019t like, wasting taxpayer dollars, costing American lives, causing suffering and destruction abroad, and undermining America\u2019s security.\n\nGabbard, while stressing that she is not an isolationist, said her administration would work to contrast Clinton\u2019s foreign policy failures and stop the U.S. role as the world\u2019s police.\n\n\u201cI will lead with a robust, positive foreign policy based on diplomacy and cooperation rather than confrontation and conflict,\u201d Gabbard wrote.\n\n\u201cThose who follow the Bush-Clinton doctrine believe the only way to interact with other nations is by bombing them or starving them with draconian sanctions,\u201d she continued, referencing her status as a veteran and experience on the Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees.\n\n\u201cOnly when we recognize the failings of the past\u2014embodied by Mrs. Clinton and her minions in the media\u2014can we move forward to a future of peace, dignity, transparency and aloha,\u201d Gabbard concluded.\n\nClinton sparked the recent war of words with Gabbard after describing the presidential hopeful as a \u201cfavorite of the Russians\u201d and implying that Gabbard is a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is a favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far. That\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she is also a Russian asset,\u201d Clinton stated during a podcast interview with former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign manager David Plouffe.\n\n\u201cThey [Republicans] know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate, and so I do not know who it\u2019s going to be, but I can guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most need it,\u201d Clinton added.\n\nGabbard responded, calling Clinton the \u201cqueen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\u201d\n\nShe announced last week that she will not seek re-election in order to focus entirely on her presidential bid.", "description": "Rep.
