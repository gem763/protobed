Between battling a drug habit, to knocking down Grace (Tamara Wall) during a joyride with Liam (Jude Monk McGowan) \u2014 not to mention her marital problems with Sylver (David Tag) which certainly weren\u2019t helped by the summer affair she embarked on with Liam \u2014 she\u2019s had to cope with a lot of stress as of late, but things are set to get much worse.\n\nYes, after a huge row breaks out in The Dog, Mercedes retreats to the The Loft, where she finds herself all alone. While partying on the dance floor, someone will pull the trigger and leave her for dead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe question on everyone\u2019s lips, of course, is who is the mystery shooter?\n\n(Picture: Lime Pictures)\n\nThis incident will kick-off a long-running mystery storyline, as viewers try and work out who it was that left Mercedes for dead. Goldie (Chelsee Healey) will be determined to get the bottom of things also and \u2014 given that she\u2019s proven incredibly good at detective work via her investigation into Breda\u2019s (Moya Brady) odd behaviour \u2014she could well prove successful in uncovering the truth.\n\nAs noted earlier, Mercedes has had an awful year, and her actions throughout the past couple of months have had a negative effect on several of the village\u2019s residents. The question is: which one of them would be capable of leaving the McQueen matriarch for dead?\n\nThe suspects Sylver McQueen\n\nGrace Black\n\nLiam Donovan\n\nDiane Hutchinson\n\nJoel Dexter\n\nBreda McQueen\n\nJames Nightingale\n\nCould Grace Black perhaps uncover the truth that it was, in fact, Mercedes who knocked her down and thus seek revenge?\n\nOr will Sylver find out about his wife having cheated on him with Liam?\n\nConsidering all the heartache Mercedes has caused, it\u2019s certainly going to be incredibly difficult trying to work out who exactly is responsible.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Mercedes is about to be left for dead \u2014 but who's responsible?", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_90007670_1571176456.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
