Under federal law, Democrats can force a vote of disapproval on the declaration every six months.\n\nJust 13 Republicans voted with Democrats on the initial vote in February. But that figure could rise after the Trump administration recently unveiled the list of projects that are set to lose funding \u2014 which will affect the districts of dozens of Republicans.\n\nTrump rejected the measure, in one of his first vetoes of his presidency, prompting the House to unsuccessfully attempt to override his decision.\n\nHeather Caygle contributed to this report.", "description": "\u201cOnce the Senate passes that resolution, the House will take it up,\u201d Pelosi told reporters Thursday.", "authors": ["Sarah Ferris"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b4/7d/d926767d4d2f9781e342af3a080f/190912-pelosi-getty-773.jpg"}
