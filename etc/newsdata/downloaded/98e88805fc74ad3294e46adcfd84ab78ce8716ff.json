Elliott, the fourth overall pick in 2016, is holding out until he receives a new deal \u2014 and is prepared to miss regular season games, if necessary.\n\nReports indicate Elliott and the Cowboys have traded contract proposals in recent days, but the two sides haven\u2019t been able to come to an agreement.\n\nIn what could be a positive sign, Elliott is flying back to Dallas from Mexico as the two sides continue to negotiate.\n\nCan confirm that Ezekiel Elliott is flying back to DFW today. Progress continues toward a deal. Today is a big day. \u2014 Mike Leslie (@MikeLeslieWFAA) September 3, 2019\n\nCollins, meanwhile, will become the NFl\u2019s highest-paid right tackle, per ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter. The 26-year-old joined the Cowboys in 2015 as an undrafted free agent after he fell out of the draft for being questioned in the murder of his former girlfriend. Police ruled out Collins as a suspect and he has avoided controversy in the NFL.\n\nPer Schefter, the extension creates $5.7 million in extra cap space for this season.\n\nDallas opens its season Sunday against the New York Giants.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
