But in the Thursday letter to the NFL, the lawyer writes that her client is not seeking any payment in connection with her allegations, SI reports.\n\nThe woman claims that the text string came from the same phone number that Brown provided to her in 2017, the report says.\n\nAccording to SI, within the text string is a reference to the artist as a \u201csuper broke girl\u201d and a request for someone called \u201cEric B\u201d to \u201clook up her background history.\u201d\n\nThen there is an Instagram photo of the woman with her children, accompanied by the message, \u201cthose her kids \u2026 she\u2019s awful broke clearly.\u201d\n\nIn her letter to the NFL, the artist\u2019s lawyer, Lisa J. Banks, describes the texts as being \u201cintimidating and threatening\u201d to the unnamed client, and asserts that the communication violates the NFL Personal Conduct Policy, SI reports.\n\nThe magazine writes that the NFL responded to the lawyer within an hour and scheduled a phone call between investigators and the artist\u2019s attorneys. Neither the Patriots nor Brown\u2019s agent, Drew Rosenhaus, would comment on the matter, according to SI.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSI says it sought comment from Brown by sending a text to the number linked to the text messages. The magazine said it received a response, \u201cfoh clown,\u201d with \u201cfoh\u201d being an acronym for the words, \u201cget the f--- out of here.\u201d\n\nAmid the turmoil of recent weeks, Brown debuted for the Patriots last Sunday, catching four passes for 56 yards and scoring one touchdown in the team\u2019s 43-0 win over the Miami Dolphins. The Patriots are scheduled to play at home this weekend against the New York Jets.", "description": "The NFL received a letter Thursday evening, in which a lawyer claims that embattled New England Patriots star Antonio Brown sent his client \u201cintimidating\u201d text messages after her allegations about Brown\u2019s past behavior went public this week, a report says.", "authors": ["Dom Calicchio"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/16/694940094001_6086801437001_6086789334001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
