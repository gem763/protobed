Sign up here.\n\nSouth Korea removed Japan from its list of most trusted trading partners, the latest sign of unraveling ties between two U.S. allies mired in a series of disputes.\n\nThe change means that exports of some strategic goods to Japan will receive greater scrutiny than shipments to 28 other fast-track destinations, South Korea\u2019s trade ministry said early Wednesday in a statement.\n\nThe move comes after Japan last month cut South Korea from a so-called \u201cwhite list\u201d of nations it deems safe for export of strategic materials. South Korea also plans to terminate a U.S.-endorsed intelligence-sharing pact with Japan and has filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization against its neighbor for imposing tighter export controls on materials key to tech manufacturing.\n\nTrade Flows Favor Japan as Tensions With Korea Heat Up: Charts\n\nThe trade tensions have hurt South Korea\u2019s economic outlook as some of the country\u2019s major companies rely on materials from Japan to make products such as memory chips and displays. The escalated tension bodes ill for the economies already struggling amid weak global demand and the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nJapan\u2019s exports to South Korea fell 9.4% in August, compared with a year earlier, while exports of chip making equipment to its neighbor fell almost 40%.\n\nThe dispute stems largely from differences in perception as to whether Japan has shown sufficient contrition for its 1910-45 colonization of the Korean Peninsula. Last year, the South Korean Supreme Court ruled in favor of individuals seeking compensation from Japanese firms for forced labor during the colonial era. Japan says the ruling violates a 1965 treaty between the two governments.\n\nIn the statement, South Korea\u2019s trade ministry said the revision is to improve the country\u2019s control of strategic material exports, and is not a retaliation against Japan. It said the country has notified Japan of the changes, and explained the background of the revisions through various routes.\n\nIsshu Sugawara, Japan\u2019s trade minister, issued a statement saying it was regrettable that South Korea had taken the measure without providing a proper explanation.\n\n\u201cThe Trade Ministry will continue to urge the South Korean trade authorities to fulfill their responsibility to explain this to the international community,\u201d he said.\n\n(Updates with reaction from Japan Trade Ministry and trade data.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Sam Kim in Seoul at skim609@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Malcolm Scott at mscott23@bloomberg.net, Jiyeun Lee, Jason Clenfield\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.\u00a0Sign up here.\u00a0South Korea removed Japan from its list of most trusted trading partners, the latest sign of unraveling ties between two U.S. allies mired in a series of disputes.The change means that exports", "authors": ["Sam Kim"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/c9mRxRyZpm9QejHThQipEA--~B/aD05NjI7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/7050a2a482156bb959950f1223376976", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
