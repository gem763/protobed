With two strikes to his name, and the Houston Astros already with two outs at the bottom of the ninth inning against the New York Yankees, a walk-off two-run home run from Jose Altuve sparked delirium inside Minute Maid Park as the Astros booked their ticket to the World Series.\n\nAltuve's 31st home run of the year, and his fifth in the postseason, could not have come at a better time, securing a 4-2 series win over the Yankees to clinch the American League pennant.\n\nChampions in 2017, after a seven-game epic against the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Astros now face the Washington Nationals in next week's big show, with the Nationals making a first-ever appearance in the World Series.\n\nHouston's stellar pitching line-up headlined by Justin Verlander, the 8x All-Star, will have refocused by the time Game 1 gets underway on Tuesday night, but Altuve's strike was a joyous moment - for everyone bar the Yankees.\n\nAaron Boone's side, who visited London earlier in the year, will have to wait for title number 28. New York hopes had been raised after DJ LeMahieu's two-run shot at the top of the ninth inning to tie the game at 4-4, but Altuve had other ideas, his drive to left-centre clinching a 6-4 victory.", "description": "A fairytale finish.", "authors": ["Ben Coles", "Paul Hayward", "Sam Wallace", "Sir Ian Mcgeechan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/baseball/2019/10/20/TELEMMGLPICT000213563406-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq900leoZVuq6ru6F43OqP_jlaTMTxUhlzF8Rkw038U-A.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
