And that\u2019s really where I\u2019m coming from,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Gabbard, who has said impeaching the president would be too divisive for the country, went on to call Mr. Trump \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cunfit\u201d to serve as president.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running for president to defeat him. I just think it\u2019s so important for our country to be able to move forward, to bridge these divides, that it be the American people that make this decision,\u201d she said.\n\nThe White House released a transcript of the call on Wednesday that did not show Mr. Trump threaten to withhold military aid unless Mr. Zelensky agreed to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, and his business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nMr. Trump did suggest that Mr. Zelensky look into Mr. Biden\u2019s claim that he pushed to get rid of a prosecutor who had reportedly been eyeing an energy company where his son had been on the board.\n\n\u201cHe is using his position for his own political gain. I think that\u2019s very clear. It\u2019s also not surprising,\u201d Ms. Gabbard said of Mr. Trump. \u201cThis is something Donald Trump has been doing throughout his time in the White House.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
