Everyone fears the \u201cinverted yield curve\u201d \u2013 where short-term interest rates exceed long-term rates. So you contemplate cutting short-term rates. OK, but you\u2019re ignoring bigger basics. Dump all those bonds you idiotically bought under your ill-conceived \u201cQuantitative dis-Easing\u201d (QE) programs. Get real.\n\nYou should worry about an inverted curve. Why? Banking\u2019s core business has always been borrowing at short-term rates to fund long-term loans. The higher long rates are above short rates, then the more profitable future lending is. So, then, banks become more eager to lend, they loan more \u2013 and to customers who need the loans more. No spread. Fewer loans.\n\nSo, many pundits urge cutting short rates. That\u2019s understandable! Convention claims lower prices spur demand. If you cut the price of borrowing \u2013 shouldn\u2019t you get more of it?\n\nBut that\u2019s demand-side thinking.\n\nWait, negative interest rates? Trump wants Fed to cut interest rates to zero or below. Here's what it could mean for you.\n\nNew car prices: Why buying a new car is more expensive than ever\n\nBut price and quantity are determined by demand and supply together. In this economic cycle the supply side of monetary policy has been hugely stronger than the demand side. We already have super low rates. Everywhere! If these aren\u2019t low enough, heaven help us. Excessively low rates are why the yield curve inverted in the first place. Not because the Fed jacked up short rates, fighting inflation, like every cycle before. But because long rates plunged globally. The 30-year U.S. bond yield is just over 2%. Japanese 15-year bonds have negative yields. All German government rates are negative.\n\nYet these overly cheap rates aren\u2019t spurring massive lending anywhere. Global money supply growth has decelerated since 2012. We\u2019ve had low-interest-rate tight money. Are central bankers bonkers? Do they really believe cutting further boosts borrowing? Are you really hot to lend your savings long term at 1%?\n\nCutting short rates alone isn\u2019t adequate. It\u2019s still low-interest-rate tight money. As Europe shows, lower than low doesn\u2019t get it on. European negative short rates force Europe\u2019s banks to charge savers for deposits. You wanna be Europe? Cutting further hurts, doesn\u2019t help, creating even less lending and slower growth.\n\nMany stupidly say cutting short-term rates reduces long rates, stimulating corporate and homebuyer borrowing. If so, loan growth should have zoomed during QE\u2019s introduction, when the Fed forced long rates lower by buying trillions of long-term bonds. It didn\u2019t. Lending crawled, increasing only when they tapered their bond buying.\n\nBonkers central bankers can\u2019t fathom that the overall loan price, or average interest rate, is less important now than the availability and quantity of loans. Supply matters. Here and overseas, central bankers should stimulate monetary supply. They should steepen the yield curve by selling those bonds they never should have bought and letting long rates rise. Then lenders will want to lend.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t mean slowly. Do a quick disgorgement here and overseas. Last week\u2019s ECB decision by Mario Draghi to restart its QE only drags down Europe. He should sell the ECB\u2019s bonds, handing that legacy to incoming ECB head Christine Lagarde \u2014creating supply sanity. The Bank of England and Japan should do this, too. Return central bank balance sheets to historic normality by letting long rates rise. They couldn\u2019t soar, because we haven\u2019t much inflation. But they\u2019d rise enough to re-steepen yield curves globally \u2013 and ignite lending.\n\nFree-flowing money would boost business investment virtually everywhere that corporate capital expenditure has struggled. Long-shelved projects of corporate borrowers would finally get the green light. Homebuyers, too. Economies would accelerate. Stocks would love it.\n\nSo how about it, Fed? Ignore your low-interest rate tight money. Ignore the demand side. Let loan and money growth accelerate. Sell those trillions of bonds you never should have bought.\n\nKen Fisher is founder and executive chairman of Fisher Investments, author of 11 books, four of which were New York Times bestsellers, and is No. 200 on the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans.
