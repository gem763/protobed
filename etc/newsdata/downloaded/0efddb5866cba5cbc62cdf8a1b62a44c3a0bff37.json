Power.\n\nThe Motor City\u2019s airport emerged as the winner among mega airports, scoring 786 out of 1,000 points, followed by Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport/Wold (779) and Las Vegas McCarran International Airport (777).\n\nThe 2019 North America Airport Satisfaction Study surveyed how satisfied 32,276 U.S. and Canadian travelers were with mega, large and medium airports in North America, and considered six metrics \u2014 from airport accessibility to baggage claim.\n\nPortland International Airport clinched the top spot in the large airport category, and Indianapolis International Airport took No. 1 in the medium airport category.\n\n401193 06: Members of the general public walk through a preview of Detroit Metro Airports new Midfield Terminal February 16, 2002 in Detroit, MI. The $1.2 billion, 97 gate facility is the largest new airport terminal to be built in the U.S. since Hartsford Atlanta International Airport opened in 1980. The new Midfield Terminal takes up two million acres, is one mile long, and took nearly four years to complete.

Power told Yahoo Finance. \u201cThey\u2019ve been near the top of the mega rankings the last few years.\u201d\n\nConstruction issues in and around the DTW campus have held the airport back in previous rankings. \u201cWith the finish of some road construction, access to DTW has improved, and that\u2019s a key to success,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nWhat has been a surprise is how far DTW has come.\n\n\u201cDTW is an American airport success story,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cA decade or so ago, it was a very poorly rated airport. Today they\u2019re at the top of the mega category.\u201d\n\nAirline passengers wait for a line to shrink in order to re-enter Terminal 8 at the John F Kennedy International Airport following a security breach that required the evacuation of the terminal in New York January 16, 2010.

Kennedy Airport (JFK) or Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) always fared poorly in the rankings, Taylor said it came down to mobility.\n\n\u201cAirports located in dense, urban areas do have difficulties achieving high scores \u2026 [and it\u2019s] mostly due to traffic congestion on the way to the airport,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRush hour in New York, Los Angeles or Boston isn\u2019t exactly conducive to a quick, efficient trip to the airport,\u201d he said, noting that 9/11 \u201cthrew a monkey wrench into airport improvement plans at these mega airports.\u201d\n\nThe good news for jet-setters is that change is coming.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of billions of dollars of improvements at almost every major airport in North America,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cOnce completed, many major airports will be considerably improved with better service and amenities for passengers.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that airline rankings can vary based on source and metrics.\n\nFor instance, Yahoo Finance previously reported that San Diego International Airport was ranked the best airport in America by The Points Guy, because of impressive offerings within the terminal, such as restaurants and lounges.\n\nIn the Skytrax list, American airports are missing from the top ranks. The list pitted the U.S. against other countries like Singapore, Japan and South Korea. Airports in Asia and Europe came out on top.\n\nThis survey by J.D. Power specifically looked at passenger satisfaction with American airports.\n\n\u2014\n\nAarthi is a writer for Yahoo Finance.
