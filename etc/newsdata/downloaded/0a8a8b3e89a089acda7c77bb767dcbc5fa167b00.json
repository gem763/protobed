Eileen Rivers, USA TODAY Opinion\n\nThe late-night comics give us the latest on impeachment in Best of Late Night.\n\nThere are at least two plus-ones cropping up in President Donald Trump's impeachment scandal. And they are accompanying different players.\n\nThe original whistleblower now has company as another person with information on the president's phone call with Ukraine has come forward. And the second whistleblower was apparently, to quote a line from the now famous \"Hamilton\" song, \"in the room where it (happened).\" Critics who slammed the origins of the first memo for containing second-hand information, may not be able to lob the same complaint about information obtained from the second person to step forward.\n\nWho is the other plus-one? Someone who's been accompanying the president since he stepped into office: Vice President Mike Pence. What did Pence know and when did he know it? Late-night comic Stephen Colbert explores in Best of Late Night, above.\n\n\"Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert (Photo: Scott Kowalchyk/CBS)\n\nTake a look at our top picks from this weekend's late-night lineup, then vote for yours in the poll below.\n\nFollow Eileen Rivers on Twitter @msdc14.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/best-of-late-night/2019/10/07/colbert-trump-impeachment-scandal-now-has-mike-pence/3900561002/", "description": "The late-night comics give us the latest on impeachment in Best of Late Night.", "authors": ["Eileen Rivers", "Published P.M.
