Patient 'Ms A' was stripped naked by staff and left with only a tear-proof blanket to sleep on the floor without a mattress or pillow in November 2013. The Southern District Health Board has agreed to apologise\n\nMental Health Commissioner Kevin Allan found the Southern District Health Board breached the girl's right to have her dignity and independence respected, and recommended they review their guidelines, provide additional training for staff and apologise to the young woman.\n\nThe girl's ordeal began on 10 November 2013 when, aged in her late teens, she ran away from a mental health clinic where she was undergoing compulsory treatment for depression, anxiety, self-harm and attempted suicide.\n\nThe teenager, known only as 'Ms A', was found by police sitting in a tree and had harmed herself, the report said.\n\nPolice forced the girl out of the tree, restrained her, and took her to a secure unit as there were no beds available at the psychiatric hospital's locked unit, the report said.\n\nWhen she arrived at the secure unit about 8.30pm, her clothing was removed and she was not given a tear-resistant gown to cover herself until 11am the next day.\n\nMs A told the Commissioner that a number of nurses had held her down and taken off her clothes by force, including her underwear.\n\nOnce she was naked, the staff pushed her onto the floor, left the room and locked the door leaving her with only a tear-resistant blanket and a cardboard bed pan, Ms A said.\n\nMs A was not given a mattress or pillow to lie on.\n\n'Ms A said it was extremely uncomfortable trying to sleep on the cold hard surface, especially as the blanket would not wrap around her completely, and she did not want to lie on the top of the blanket because the nurses observing her through the window and door would see her naked,' the report said.\n\n'She stated that the staff left the lights on full all night, so it was impossible to sleep.'\n\nThe Southern District Health Board told the Commissioner that leaving the lights on was standard practice for observation checks, however Commissioner Allan noted the lights could be dimmed.\n\nMental health nurse Dr Anthony O'Brien, the Commissioner's expert adviser, said Ms A could have been given a tear-resistant gown, a mattress, and a pillow.\n\n'It was probably the worst, most humiliating and dehumanising thing I have ever experienced,' the young woman said.

Of all the learning that can be taken from this incident, the point that would make the most immediate impact on [Ms A's] experience of care is the simple provision of every day comforts,' he said in the report.\n\nThe girl's seclusion did not end until 2pm that day, and she told the Mental Health Commissioner the treatment had left emotional scars.\n\n'I do accept that I presented a significant risk to myself, however I do not believe that this risk necessitated seclusion, nor the treatment that I received whilst in seclusion. I believe I could have been managed on a locked ward without being secluded. What I experienced on that occasion was incredibly dehumanising and continues to affect me,' she said in the report.\n\nMental Health Commissioner Kevin Allan said in his decision that the actions were unacceptable.\n\n'I am not able to make a finding that the denial of clothing and bedding was a punitive action or intended to humiliate Ms A; however, I consider that these actions were unacceptable and unkind,' he said in his report.\n\nThe Southern District Health Board agreed to provide a written apology to Ms A.\n\nThe board also agreed to train psychiatric hospital staff on restraint, seclusion and consumer rights, to review its restraint minimisation and seclusion guidelines, and to review the seclusion policy to provide specific guidance on what to give patients in seclusion including clothing and bedding.\n\nIf you are suffering from depression or experiencing mental health issues, talk to your doctor.
