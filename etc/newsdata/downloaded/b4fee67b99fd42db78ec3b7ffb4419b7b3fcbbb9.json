He wasn't even looking up at the time which suggests this was a premeditated move to generate a bit of publicity.'\n\nBBC statement in full Guests who appear on the Andrew Marr show expect robust interviewing that includes back and forth between themselves and Mr Marr. Andrew Marr commented on Priti Patel laughing after he glanced up while reading a list of business leaders concerned about the impact of Brexit on their industries. He thought he saw the Home Secretary smile but now accepts this was in fact her natural expression and wasn't indicating amusement at his line of questioning. There was no intention to cause offence and we are sorry if viewers felt this to be the case.\n\nConservative MPs were also furious, saying Marr had no right to 'berate' the Home Secretary and seemed to have 'forgotten that the British people did actually vote for Brexit'.\n\nSenior backbencher Nigel Evans said: 'Part of the problem is that people like Andrew Marr forget that the British people actually voted for Brexit.\n\n'The people who pay the licence fee, the people who pay their taxes, they voted for Brexit.'\n\nHe added: 'It is called democracy.... Democracy within the BBC is give us the licence fee and we will pump whatever we want at you.'\n\n'It is pointless him berating the Home Secretary for trying to deliver what we promised the British people three years ago we would deliver.'\n\nDuring the interview, Ms Patel said ministers were looking at 'alternative arrangements' for intelligence and data sharing, but denied it feared an upsurge of Irish republican terrorism in the event of no-deal.\n\n'That is not the case at all,' she said.\n\nThe exchange sparked outrage among Mrs Patel's (pictured on the show on October 13) Tory colleagues\n\n'Our security arrangements will be based upon the type of tools, the type of shared intelligence forums and the data sharing platforms that we currently have, but again looking at alternative arrangements in which we can share that intelligence and information and data. We have been working on that over the last three months.'\n\nShe added: 'When it comes to security tools and security co-operation there are many measures that are being put in place right now in preparedness for no-deal. Those include a range of security tools that we have been working on.\n\n'Specifically to Northern Ireland, we are very conscious and we are working with all organisations, agencies to ensure that we remain safe.'\n\nA BBC spokesman said in a statement: 'Guests who appear on the Andrew Marr show expect robust interviewing that includes back and forth between themselves and Mr Marr.\n\n'Andrew Marr commented on Priti Patel laughing after he glanced up while reading a list of business leaders concerned about the impact of Brexit on their industries.\n\n'He thought he saw the Home Secretary smile but now accepts this was in fact her natural expression and wasn't indicating amusement at his line of questioning.\n\n'There was no intention to cause offence and we are sorry if viewers felt this to be the case.'", "description": "Andrew Marr suggested Home Secretary Priti Patel smirked as he read out a long list of industry leaders' worries about Brexit, scolding her: 'I can't see why you're laughing.'", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/12/20032114-0-image-a-2_1571743443433.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
