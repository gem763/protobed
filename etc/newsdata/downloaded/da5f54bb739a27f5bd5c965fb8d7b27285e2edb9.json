Right up until the last weeks of the race, the campaign headquarters had remained a listless place. All that seemed to distinguish it from a corporate back office were a few posters with right-wing slogans.\n\nConway, the campaign\u2019s manager, was in a remarkably buoyant mood, considering she was about to experience a resounding, if not cataclysmic, defeat. Donald Trump would lose the election \u2014 of this she was sure \u2014 but he would quite possibly hold the defeat to under six points. That was a substantial victory. As for the looming defeat itself, she shrugged it off: It was Reince Priebus\u2019s fault, not hers.\n\nShe had spent a good part of the day calling friends and allies in the political world and blaming Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee. Now she briefed some of the television producers and anchors whom she had been carefully courting since joining the Trump campaign \u2014 and with whom she had been actively interviewing in the last few weeks, hoping to land a permanent on-air job after the election.\n\nEven though the numbers in a few key states had appeared to be changing to Trump\u2019s advantage, neither Conway nor Trump himself nor his son-in-law, Jared Kushner \u2014 the effective head of the campaign \u2014 \u00adwavered in their certainty: Their unexpected adventure would soon be over. Not only would Trump not be president, almost everyone in the campaign agreed, he should probably not be. Conveniently, the former conviction meant nobody had to deal with the latter issue.\n\nAs the campaign came to an end, Trump himself was sanguine. His ultimate goal, after all, had never been to win. \u201cI can be the most famous man in the world,\u201d he had told his aide Sam Nunberg at the outset of the race. His longtime friend Roger Ailes, the former head of Fox News, liked to say that if you want a career in television, first run for president. Now Trump, encouraged by Ailes, was floating rumors about a Trump network. It was a great future. He would come out of this campaign, Trump assured Ailes, with a far more powerful brand and untold opportunities.\n\n\u201cThis is bigger than I ever dreamed of,\u201d he told Ailes a week before the election. \u201cI don\u2019t think about losing, because it isn\u2019t losing. We\u2019ve totally won.\u201d\n\nThe Postelection Chaos at Trump Tower\n\nFrom the start, the leitmotif for Trump about his own campaign was how crappy it was, and how everybody involved in it was a loser. In August, when he was trailing Hillary Clinton by more than 12 points, he couldn\u2019t conjure even a far-fetched scenario for achieving an electoral victory. He was baffled when the right-wing billionaire Robert Mercer, a Ted Cruz backer whom Trump barely knew, offered him an infusion of $5 million. When Mercer and his daughter Rebekah presented their plan to take over the campaign and install their lieutenants, Steve Bannon and Conway, Trump didn\u2019t resist. He only expressed vast incomprehension about why anyone would want to do that. \u201cThis thing,\u201d he told the Mercers, \u201cis so fucked up.\u201d\n\nBannon, who became chief executive of Trump\u2019s team in mid-August, called it \u201cthe broke-dick campaign.\u201d Almost immediately, he saw that it was hampered by an even deeper structural flaw: The candidate who billed himself as a billionaire \u2014 ten times over \u2014 refused to invest his own money in it. Bannon told Kushner that, after the first debate in September, they would need another $50 million to cover them until Election Day.\n\n\u201cNo way we\u2019ll get 50 million unless we can guarantee him victory,\u201d said a clear-eyed Kushner.\n\n\u201cTwenty-five million?\u201d prodded Bannon.\n\n\u201cIf we can say victory is more than likely.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the best Trump would do is to loan the campaign $10 million, provided he got it back as soon as they could raise other money. Steve Mnuchin, the campaign\u2019s finance chairman, came to collect the loan with the wire instructions ready to go so Trump couldn\u2019t conveniently forget to send the money.\n\nMost presidential candidates spend their entire careers, if not their lives from adolescence, preparing for the role. They rise up the ladder of elected offices, perfect a public face, and prepare themselves to win and to govern. The Trump calculation, quite a conscious one, was different. The candidate and his top lieutenants believed they could get all the benefits of almost becoming president without having to change their behavior or their worldview one whit. Almost everybody on the Trump team, in fact, came with the kind of messy conflicts bound to bite a president once he was in office. Michael Flynn, the retired general who served as Trump\u2019s opening act at campaign rallies, had been told by his friends that it had not been a good idea to take $45,000 from the Russians for a speech. \u201cWell, it would only be a problem if we won,\u201d \u00adFlynn assured them.\n\nNot only did Trump disregard the potential conflicts of his own business deals and real-estate holdings, he audaciously refused to release his tax returns. Why should he? Once he lost, Trump would be both insanely famous and a martyr to Crooked Hillary. His daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared would be international celebrities. Steve Bannon would become the de facto head of the tea-party movement. Kellyanne Conway would be a cable-news star. Melania Trump, who had been assured by her husband that he wouldn\u2019t become president, could return to inconspicuously lunching. Losing would work out for everybody. Losing was winning.\n\nShortly after 8 p.m. on Election Night, when the unexpected trend \u2014 Trump might actually win \u2014 seemed confirmed, Don Jr. told a friend that his father, or DJT, as he calls him, looked as if he had seen a ghost. Melania was in tears \u2014 and not of joy.\n\nThere was, in the space of little more than an hour, in Steve Bannon\u2019s not unamused observation, a befuddled Trump morphing into a disbelieving Trump and then into a horrified Trump. But still to come was the final transformation: Suddenly, Donald Trump became a man who believed that he deserved to be, and was wholly capable of being, the president of the United States.\n\nRoger Ailes and Steve Bannon meeting on January 3, 2017. Illustration: Jeffrey Smith\n\nFrom the moment of victory, the Trump administration became a looking-glass presidency: Every inverse assumption about how to assemble and run a White House was enacted and compounded, many times over. The decisions that Trump and his top advisers made in those first few months \u2014 from the slapdash transition to the disarray in the West Wing \u2014 set the stage for the chaos and dysfunction that have persisted throughout his first year in office. This was a real-life version of Mel Brooks\u2019s The Producers, where the mistaken outcome trusted by everyone in Trump\u2019s inner circle \u2014 that they would lose the election \u2014 wound up exposing them for who they really were.\n\nOn the Saturday after the election, Trump received a small group of well-\u00adwishers in his triplex apartment in Trump Tower. Even his close friends were still shocked and bewildered, and there was a dazed quality to the gathering. But Trump himself was mostly looking at the clock. Rupert Murdoch, who had promised to pay a call on the president-elect, was running late. When some of the guests made a move to leave, an increasingly agitated Trump assured them that Rupert was on his way. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the greats, the last of the greats,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou have to stay to see him.\u201d Not grasping that he was now the most powerful man in the world, Trump was still trying mightily to curry favor with a media mogul who had long disdained him as a charlatan and fool.\n\nFew people who knew Trump had illusions about him. That was his appeal: He was what he was. Twinkle in his eye, larceny in his soul. Everybody in his rich-guy social circle knew about his wide-ranging ignorance. Early in the campaign, Sam Nunberg was sent to explain the Constitution to the candidate. \u201cI got as far as the Fourth Amendment,\u201d Nunberg recalled, \u201cbefore his finger is pulling down on his lip and his eyes are rolling back in his head.\u201d\n\nThe day after the election, the bare-bones transition team that had been set up during the campaign hurriedly shifted from Washington to Trump Tower. The building \u2014 now the headquarters of a populist revolution \u2014\u00ad suddenly seemed like an alien spaceship on Fifth Avenue. But its otherworldly air helped obscure the fact that few in Trump\u2019s inner circle, with their overnight responsibility for assembling a government, had any relevant experience.\n\nAiles, a veteran of the Nixon, Reagan, and Bush 41 administrations, tried to impress on Trump the need to create a White House structure that could serve and protect him. \u201cYou need a son of a bitch as your chief of staff,\u201d he told Trump. \u201cAnd you need a son of a bitch who knows Washington. You\u2019ll want to be your own son of a bitch, but you don\u2019t know Washington.\u201d Ailes had a suggestion: John Boehner, who had stepped down as Speaker of the House only a year earlier.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d asked Trump.\n\nAs much as the president himself, the chief of staff determines how the Executive branch \u2014 which employs 4 million people \u2014 will run. The job has been construed as deputy president, or even prime minister. But Trump had no interest in appointing a strong chief of staff with a deep knowledge of Washington. Among his early choices for the job was Kushner \u2014 a man with no political experience beyond his role as a calm and flattering body man to Trump during the campaign.\n\nIt was Ann Coulter who finally took the president-elect aside. \u201cNobody is apparently telling you this,\u201d she told him. \u201cBut you can\u2019t. You just can\u2019t hire your children.\u201d\n\nBowing to pressure, Trump floated the idea of giving the job to Steve Bannon, only to have the notion soundly ridiculed. Murdoch told Trump that Bannon would be a dangerous choice. Joe Scarborough, the former congressman and co-host of MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, told the president-elect that \u201cWashington will go up in flames\u201d if Bannon became chief of staff.\n\nSo Trump turned to Reince Priebus, the RNC chairman, who had become the subject of intense lobbying by House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. If congressional leaders were going to have to deal with an alien like Donald Trump, then best they do it with the help of one of their own kind.\n\nJim Baker, chief of staff for both Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush and almost everybody\u2019s model for managing the West Wing, advised Priebus not to take the job. Priebus had his own reservations: He had come out of his first long meeting with Trump thinking it had been a disconcertingly weird experience. Trump talked nonstop and constantly repeated himself.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the deal,\u201d a close Trump associate told Priebus. \u201cIn an hour meeting with him, you\u2019re going to hear 54 minutes of stories, and they\u2019re going to be the same stories over and over again. So you have to have one point to make, and you pepper it in whenever you can.\u201d\n\nBut the Priebus appointment, announced in mid-November, put Bannon on a co-equal level to the new chief of staff. Even with the top job, Priebus would be a weak figure, in the traditional mold of most Trump lieutenants over the years. There would be one chief of staff in name \u2014 the unimportant one \u2014 and \u00adothers like Bannon and Kushner, more important in practice, ensuring both chaos and Trump\u2019s independence.\n\nPriebus demonstrated no ability to keep Trump from talking to anyone who wanted his ear. The president-elect enjoyed being courted. On December 14, a high-level delegation from Silicon Valley came to Trump Tower to meet him. Later that afternoon, according to a source privy to details of the conversation, Trump called Rupert Murdoch, who asked him how the meeting had gone.\n\n\u201cOh, great, just great,\u201d said Trump. \u201cThese guys really need my help. Obama was not very favorable to them, too much regulation. This is really an opportunity for me to help them.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald,\u201d said Murdoch, \u201cfor eight years these guys had Obama in their pocket. They practically ran the administration. They don\u2019t need your help.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake this H-1B visa issue. They really need these H-1B visas.\u201d\n\nMurdoch suggested that taking a liberal approach to H-1B visas, which open America\u2019s doors to select immigrants, might be hard to square with his promises to build a wall and close the borders. But Trump seemed unconcerned, assuring Murdoch, \u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a fucking idiot,\u201d said Murdoch, shrugging, as he got off the phone.\n\nTrump berating Jared Kushner on January 29, 2017. Illustration: Jeffrey Smith\n\nSteve Bannon, suddenly among the world\u2019s most powerful men, was running late. It was the evening of January 3, 2017 \u2014 a little more than two weeks before Trump\u2019s inauguration \u2014 and Bannon had promised to come to a small dinner arranged by mutual friends in a Greenwich Village townhouse to see Roger Ailes.\n\nSnow was threatening, and for a while the dinner appeared doubtful. But the 76-year-old Ailes, who was as dumbfounded by his old friend Donald Trump\u2019s victory as everyone else, understood that he was passing the right-wing torch to Bannon. Ailes\u2019s Fox News, with its $1.5 billion in annual profits, had dominated Republican politics for two decades. Now Bannon\u2019s Breit\u00adbart News, with its mere $1.5 million in annual profits, was claiming that role. For 30 years, Ailes \u2014 until recently the single most powerful person in conservative \u00adpolitics \u2014 had humored and tolerated Trump, but in the end Bannon and Breitbart had elected him.\n\nAt 9:30, having extricated himself from Trump Tower, Bannon finally arrived at the dinner, three hours late. Wearing a disheveled blazer, his signature pairing of two shirts, and military fatigues, the unshaven, overweight 63-year-old immediately dived into an urgent download of information about the world he was about to take over.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to flood the zone so we have every Cabinet member for the next seven days through their confirmation hearings,\u201d he said of the business-and-military, 1950s-type Cabinet choices. \u201cTillerson is two days, Sessions is two days, Mattis is two days \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d said Bannon, \u201cI could use your help here.\u201d He then spent several minutes trying to recruit Ailes to help kneecap Murdoch.\n\nBannon veered from James \u201cMad Dog\u201d \u00adMattis \u2014 the retired four-star general whom Trump had nominated as secretary of Defense \u2014 to the looming appointment of Michael Flynn as national-security adviser. \u201cHe\u2019s fine. He\u2019s not Jim Mattis and he\u2019s not John Kelly \u2026 but he\u2019s fine. He just needs the right staff around him.\u201d Still, Bannon averred: \u201cWhen you take out all the Never Trump guys who signed all those letters and all the neocons who got us in all these wars \u2026 it\u2019s not a deep bench.\u201d Bannon said he\u2019d tried to push John Bolton, the famously hawkish diplomat, for the job as national-security adviser. Bolton was an Ailes favorite, too.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a bomb thrower,\u201d said Ailes. \u201cAnd a strange little fucker. But you need him. Who else is good on Israel? Flynn is a little nutty on Iran. Tillerson just knows oil.\u201d\n\n\u201cBolton\u2019s mustache is a problem,\u201d snorted Bannon. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t think he looks the part. You know Bolton is an acquired taste.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, he got in trouble because he got in a fight in a hotel one night and chased some woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I told Trump that,\u201d Bannon said slyly, \u201che might have the job.\u201d\n\nBannon was curiously able to embrace Trump while at the same time suggesting he did not take him entirely seriously. Great numbers of people, he believed, were suddenly receptive to a new message \u2014 the world needs borders \u2014 and Trump had become the platform for that message.\n\n\u201cDoes he get it?\u201d asked Ailes suddenly, looking intently at Bannon. Did Trump get where history had put him?\n\nBannon took a sip of water. \u201cHe gets it,\u201d he said, after hesitating for perhaps a beat too long. \u201cOr he gets what he gets.\u201d\n\nPivoting from Trump himself, Bannon plunged on with the Trump agenda. \u201cDay one we\u2019re moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. Netanyahu\u2019s all-in. Sheldon\u201d \u2014 Adelson, the casino billionaire and far-right Israel defender \u2014 \u201cis all-in. We know where we\u2019re heading on this \u2026 Let Jordan take the West Bank, let Egypt take Gaza. Let them deal with it. Or sink trying.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Donald on this?\u201d asked Ailes, the clear implication being that Bannon was far out ahead of his benefactor.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s totally onboard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t give Donald too much to think about,\u201d said an amused Ailes.\n\nBannon snorted. \u201cToo much, too little \u2014 doesn\u2019t necessarily change things.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat has he gotten himself into with the Russians?\u201d pressed Ailes.\n\n\u201cMostly,\u201d said Bannon, \u201che went to Russia and he thought he was going to meet Putin. But Putin couldn\u2019t give a shit about him. So he\u2019s kept trying.\u201d\n\nAgain, as though setting the issue of Trump aside \u2014 merely a large and peculiar presence to both be thankful for and to have to abide \u2014 Bannon, in the role he had conceived for himself, the auteur of the Trump presidency, charged forward. The real enemy, he said, was China. China was the first front in a new Cold War.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s everything. Nothing else matters. We don\u2019t get China right, we don\u2019t get anything right. This whole thing is very simple. China is where Nazi Germany was in 1929 to 1930. The Chinese, like the Germans, are the most rational people in the world, until they\u2019re not. And they\u2019re gonna flip like Germany in the \u201930s. You\u2019re going to have a hypernationalist state, and once that happens, you can\u2019t put the genie back in the bottle.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald might not be Nixon in China,\u201d said Ailes, deadpan.\n\nBannon smiled. \u201cBannon in China,\u201d he said, with both remarkable grandiosity and wry self-deprecation.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s the kid?\u201d asked Ailes, referring to Kushner.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s my partner,\u201d said Bannon, his tone suggesting that if he felt otherwise, he was nevertheless determined to stay on message.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s had a lot of lunches with Rupert,\u201d said a dubious Ailes.\n\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d said Bannon, \u201cI could use your help here.\u201d He then spent several minutes trying to recruit Ailes to help kneecap Murdoch. Since his ouster from Fox over allegations of sexual harassment, Ailes had become only more bitter toward Murdoch. Now Murdoch was frequently jawboning the president-elect and encouraging him toward Establishment moderation. Bannon wanted Ailes to suggest to Trump, a man whose many neuroses included a horror of senility, that Murdoch might be losing it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll call him,\u201d said Ailes. \u201cBut Trump would jump through hoops for Rupert. Like for Putin. Sucks up and shits down. I just worry about who\u2019s jerking whose chain.\u201d\n\nTrump holed up in his White House bedroom in February 2017. Illustration: Jeffrey Smith\n\n\ufeffTrump did not enjoy his own inauguration. He was angry that A-level stars had snubbed the event, disgruntled with the accommodations at Blair House, and visibly fighting with his wife, who seemed on the verge of tears. Throughout the day, he wore what some around him had taken to calling his golf face: angry and pissed off, shoulders hunched, arms swinging, brow furled, lips pursed.\n\nThe first senior staffer to enter the White House that day was Bannon. On the inauguration march, he had grabbed 32-year-old Katie Walsh, the newly appointed deputy chief of staff, and together they had peeled off to inspect the now-vacant West Wing. The carpet had been shampooed, but little else had changed. It was a warren of tiny offices in need of paint, the d\u00e9cor something like an admissions office at a public university. Bannon claimed the non\u00addescript office across from the much grander chief of staff\u2019s suite and immediately requisitioned the whiteboards on which he intended to chart the first 100 days of the Trump administration. He also began moving furniture out. The point was to leave no room for anyone to sit. Limit discussion. Limit debate. This was war.\n\nThose who had worked on the campaign noticed the sudden change. Within the first week, Bannon seemed to have put away the camaraderie of Trump Tower and become far more remote, if not unreachable. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with Steve?\u201d Kushner began to ask. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. We were so close.\u201d Now that Trump had been elected, Bannon was already focused on his next goal: capturing the soul of the Trump White House.\n\nHe began by going after his enemies. Few fueled his rancor toward the standard-issue Republican world as much as Rupert \u00adMurdoch \u2014 not least because Murdoch had Trump\u2019s ear. It was one of the key elements of Bannon\u2019s understanding of Trump: The last person the president spoke to ended up with enormous influence. Trump would brag that Murdoch was always calling him; Murdoch, for his part, would complain that he couldn\u2019t get Trump off the phone.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know anything about American politics, and has no feel for the American people,\u201d Bannon told Trump, always eager to point out that Murdoch wasn\u2019t an American. Yet in one regard, Murdoch\u2019s message was useful to Bannon. Having known every president since Harry \u00adTruman \u2014 as Murdoch took frequent opportunities to point out \u2014 the media mogul warned Trump that a president has only six months, max, to set his agenda and make an impact. After that, it was just putting out fires and battling the opposition.\n\nThis was the message whose urgency Bannon had been trying to impress on an often distracted Trump, who was already trying to limit his hours in the office and keep to his normal golf habits. Bannon\u2019s strategic view of government was shock and awe. In his head, he carried a set of decisive actions that would not just mark the new administration\u2019s opening days but make it clear that nothing ever again would be the same. He had quietly assembled a list of more than 200 executive orders to issue in the first 100 days. The very first EO, in his view, had to be a crackdown on immigration. After all, it was one of Trump\u2019s core campaign promises. Plus, Bannon knew, it was an issue that made liberals batshit mad.\n\nBannon could push through his agenda for a simple reason: because nobody in the administration really had a job. Priebus, as chief of staff, had to organize meetings, hire staff, and oversee the individual offices in the Executive-branch departments. But Bannon, Kushner, and Ivanka Trump had no specific responsibilities \u2014 they did what they wanted. And for Bannon, the will to get big things done was how big things got done. \u201cChaos was Steve\u2019s strategy,\u201d said Walsh.\n\nOn Friday, January 27 \u2014 only his eighth day in office \u2014 Trump signed an executive order issuing a sweeping exclusion of many Muslims from the United States. In his mania to seize the day, with almost no one in the federal government having seen it or even been aware of it, Bannon had succeeded in pushing through an executive order that overhauled U.S. immigration policy while bypassing the very agencies and personnel responsible for enforcing it.\n\nThe result was an emotional outpouring of horror and indignation from liberal media, terror in immigrant communities, tumultuous protests at major airports, confusion throughout the government, and, in the White House, an inundation of opprobrium from friends and family. What have you done? You have to undo this! You\u2019re finished before you even start! But Bannon was satisfied. He could not have hoped to draw a more vivid line between Trump\u2019s America and that of liberals. Almost the entire White House staff demanded to know: Why did we do this on a Friday, when it would hit the airports hardest and bring out the most protesters?\n\n\u201cErrr \u2026 that\u2019s why,\u201d said Bannon. \u201cSo the snowflakes would show up at the airports and riot.\u201d That was the way to crush the liberals: Make them crazy and drag them to the left.\n\nOn the Sunday after the immigration order was issued, Joe Scarborough and his Morning Joe co-host, Mika Brzezinski, arrived for lunch at the White House. Trump proudly showed them into the Oval Office. \u201cSo how do you think the first week has gone?\u201d he asked the couple, in a buoyant mood, seeking flattery. When Scarborough ventured his opinion that the immigration order might have been handled better, Trump turned defensive and derisive, plunging into a long monologue about how well things had gone. \u201cI could have invited Hannity!\u201d he told Scarborough.\n\nAfter Jared and Ivanka joined them for lunch, Trump continued to cast for positive impressions of his first week. Scarborough praised the president for having invited leaders of the steel unions to the White House. At which point Jared interjected that reaching out to unions, a Democratic constituency, was Bannon\u2019s doing, that this was \u201cthe Bannon way.\u201d\n\n\u201cBannon?\u201d said the president, jumping on his son-in-law. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t Bannon\u2019s idea. That was my idea. It\u2019s the Trump way, not the Bannon way.\u201d\n\nKushner, going concave, retreated from the discussion.\n\nTrump, changing the topic, said to Scarborough and Brzezinski, \u201cSo what about you guys? What\u2019s going on?\u201d He was referencing their not-so-secret secret relationship. The couple said it was still complicated, but good.\n\n\u201cYou guys should just get married,\u201d prodded Trump.\n\n\u201cI can marry you! I\u2019m an internet Unitarian minister,\u201d Kushner, otherwise an Orthodox Jew, said suddenly.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said the president. \u201cWhat are you talking about? Why would they want you to marry them when I could marry them? When they could be married by the president! At Mar-a-Lago!\u201d\n\nThe First Children couple were having to navigate Trump\u2019s volatile nature just like everyone else in the White House. And they were willing to do it for the same reason as everyone else \u2014 in the hope that Trump\u2019s unexpected victory would catapult them into a heretofore unimagined big time. Balancing risk against reward, both Jared and Ivanka decided to accept roles in the West Wing over the advice of almost everyone they knew. It was a joint decision by the couple, and, in some sense, a joint job. Between themselves, the two had made an earnest deal: If sometime in the future the opportunity arose, she\u2019d be the one to run for president. The first woman president, Ivanka entertained, would not be Hillary Clinton; it would be Ivanka Trump.\n\nBannon, who had coined the term \u201cJarvanka\u201d that was now in ever greater use in the White House, was horrified when the couple\u2019s deal was reported to him. \u201cThey didn\u2019t say that?\u201d he said. \u201cStop. Oh, come on. They didn\u2019t actually say that? Please don\u2019t tell me that. Oh my God.\u201d\n\nThe truth was, Ivanka and Jared were as much the chief of staff as Priebus or Bannon, all of them reporting directly to the president. The couple had opted for formal jobs in the West Wing, in part because they knew that influencing Trump required you to be all-in. From phone call to phone call \u2014 and his day, beyond organized meetings, was almost entirely phone calls \u2014 you could lose him. He could not really converse, not in the sense of sharing information, or of a balanced back-and-forth conversation. He neither particularly listened to what was said to him nor particularly considered what he said in response. He demanded you pay him attention, then decided you were weak for groveling. In a sense, he was like an instinctive, pampered, and hugely successful actor. Everybody was either a lackey who did his bidding or a high-ranking film functionary trying to coax out his performance \u2014 without making him angry or petulant.\n\nJared offered to marry Joe and Mika. \u201cWhy would they want you,\u201d Trump said, \u201cwhen I could marry them?\u201d\n\nIvanka maintained a relationship with her father that was in no way conventional. She was a helper not just in his business dealings, but in his marital realignments. If it wasn\u2019t pure opportunism, it was certainly transactional. For Ivanka, it was all business \u2014 building the Trump brand, the presidential campaign, and now the White House. She treated her father with a degree of detachment, even irony, going so far as to make fun of his comb-over to others. She often described the mechanics behind it to friends: an absolutely clean pate \u2014 a contained island after scalp-reduction \u00adsurgery \u2014 surrounded by a furry circle of hair around the sides and front, from which all ends are drawn up to meet in the center and then swept back and secured by a stiffening spray. The color, she would point out to comical effect, was from a product called Just for Men \u2014 the longer it was left on, the darker it got. Impatience resulted in Trump\u2019s orange-blond hair color.\n\nKushner, for his part, had little to no success at trying to restrain his father-in-law. Ever since the transition, Jared had been negotiating to arrange a meeting at the White House with Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the Mexican president whom Trump had threatened and insulted throughout the campaign. On the Wednesday after the inauguration, a high-level Mexican delegation \u2014 the first visit by any foreign leaders to the Trump White House \u2014 met with Kushner and Reince Priebus. That afternoon, Kushner triumphantly told his father-in-law that Pe\u00f1a Nieto had signed on to a White House meeting and planning for the visit could go forward.\n\nThe next day, on Twitter, Trump blasted Mexico for stealing American jobs. \u201cIf Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall,\u201d the president declared, \u201cthen it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting.\u201d At which point Pe\u00f1a Nieto did just that, leaving Kushner\u2019s negotiation and statecraft as so much scrap on the floor.\n\nNothing contributed to the chaos and dysfunction of the White House as much as Trump\u2019s own behavior. The big deal of being president was just not apparent to him. Most victorious candidates, arriving in the White House from ordinary political life, could not help but be reminded of their transformed circumstances by their sudden elevation to a mansion with palacelike servants and security, a plane at constant readiness, and downstairs a retinue of courtiers and advisers. But this wasn\u2019t that different from Trump\u2019s former life in Trump Tower, which was actually more commodious and to his taste than the White House.\n\nTrump, in fact, found the White House to be vexing and even a little scary. He retreated to his own bedroom \u2014 the first time since the Kennedy White House that a presidential couple had maintained separate rooms. In the first days, he ordered two television screens in addition to the one already there, and a lock on the door, precipitating a brief standoff with the Secret Service, who insisted they have access to the room. He \u00adreprimanded the housekeeping staff for picking up his shirt from the floor: \u201cIf my shirt is on the floor, it\u2019s because I want it on the floor.\u201d Then he imposed a set of new rules: Nobody touch anything, especially not his toothbrush. (He had a longtime fear of being poisoned, one reason why he liked to eat at McDonald\u2019s \u2014 nobody knew he was coming and the food was safely premade.) Also, he would let housekeeping know when he wanted his sheets done, and he would strip his own bed.\n\nIf he was not having his 6:30 dinner with Steve Bannon, then, more to his liking, he was in bed by that time with a cheeseburger, watching his three screens and making phone calls \u2014 the phone was his true contact point with the world \u2014 to a small group of friends, who charted his rising and falling levels of agitation through the evening and then compared notes with one another.\n\nAs details of Trump\u2019s personal life leaked out, he became obsessed with identifying the leaker. The source of all the gossip, however, may well have been Trump himself. In his calls throughout the day and at night from his bed, he often spoke to people who had no reason to keep his confidences. He was a river of grievances, which recipients of his calls promptly spread to the ever-attentive media.\n\nOn February 6, in one of his seething, self-pitying, and unsolicited phone calls to a casual acquaintance, Trump detailed his bent-out-of-shape feelings about the relentless contempt of the media and the disloyalty of his staff. The initial subject of his ire was the New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman, whom he called \u201ca nut job.\u201d Gail Collins, who had written a Times column unfavorably comparing Trump to Vice-President Mike Pence, was \u201ca moron.\u201d Then, continuing under the rubric of media he hated, he veered to CNN and the deep disloyalty of its chief, Jeff Zucker.\n\n\u201cIf my shirt is on the floor, it\u2019s because I want it on the floor,\u201d Trump told the housekeeping staff.\n\nZucker, who as the head of entertainment at NBC had commissioned The Apprentice, had been \u201cmade by Trump,\u201d Trump said of himself in the third person. He had \u201cpersonally\u201d gotten Zucker his job at CNN. \u201cYes, yes, I did,\u201d said the president, launching into a favorite story about how he had once talked Zucker up at a dinner with a high-ranking executive from CNN\u2019s parent company. \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have, because Zucker is not that smart,\u201d Trump lamented, \u201cbut I like to show I can do that sort of thing.\u201d Then Zucker had returned the favor by airing the \u201cunbelievably disgusting\u201d story about the Russian \u201cdossier\u201d and the \u201cgolden shower\u201d \u2014 the practice CNN had accused him of being party to in a Moscow hotel suite with assorted prostitutes.\n\nHaving dispensed with Zucker, the president of the United States went on to speculate on what was involved with a golden shower. And how this was all just part of a media campaign that would never succeed in driving him from the White House. Because they were sore losers and hated him for winning, they spread total lies, 100 percent made-up things, totally untrue, for instance, the cover that week of Time magazine \u2014 which, Trump reminded his listener, he had been on more than anyone in \u00adhistory \u2014 that showed Steve Bannon, a good guy, saying he was the real president. \u201cHow much influence do you think Steve Bannon has over me?\u201d Trump demanded. He repeated the question, then repeated the answer: \u201cZero! Zero!\u201d And that went for his son-in-law, too, who had a lot to learn.\n\nThe media was not only hurting him, he said \u2014 he was not looking for any agreement or even any response \u2014 but hurting his negotiating capabilities, which hurt the nation. And that went for Saturday Night Live, which might think it was very funny but was actually hurting everybody in the country. And while he understood that SNL was there to be mean to him, they were being very, very mean. It was \u201cfake comedy.\u201d He had reviewed the treatment of all other presidents in the media, and there was nothing like this ever, even of Nixon, who was treated very unfairly. \u201cKellyanne, who is very fair, has this all documented. You can look at it.\u201d\n\nThe point is, he said, that that very day, he had saved $700 million a year in jobs that were going to Mexico, but the media was talking about him wandering around the White House in his bathrobe, which \u201cI don\u2019t have because I\u2019ve never worn a bathrobe. And would never wear one, because I\u2019m not that kind of guy.\u201d And what the media was doing was undermining this very dignified house, and \u201cdignity is so important.\u201d But Murdoch, \u201cwho had never called me, never once,\u201d was now calling all the time. So that should tell people something.\n\nThe call went on for 26 minutes.\n\nWithout a strong chief of staff at the White House, there was no real up-and-down structure in the administration \u2014 merely a figure at the top and everyone else scrambling for his attention. It wasn\u2019t task-based so much as response-oriented \u2014 whatever captured the boss\u2019s attention focused everybody\u2019s attention. Priebus and Bannon and Kushner were all fighting to be the power behind the Trump throne. And in these crosshairs was Katie Walsh, the deputy chief of staff.\n\nWalsh, who came to the White House from the RNC, represented a certain Republican ideal: clean, brisk, orderly, efficient. A righteous bureaucrat with a permanently grim expression, she was a fine example of the many political professionals in whom competence and organizational skills transcend ideology. To Walsh, it became clear almost immediately that \u201cthe three gentlemen running things,\u201d as she came to characterize them, had each found his own way to appeal to the president. Bannon offered a rousing fuck-you show of force; Priebus offered flattery from the congressional leadership; Kushner offered the approval of blue-chip businessmen. Each appeal was exactly what Trump wanted from the presidency, and he didn\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t have them all. He wanted to break things, he wanted Congress to give him bills to sign, and he wanted the love and respect of New York machers and socialites.\n\nAs soon as the campaign team had stepped into the White House, Walsh saw, it had gone from managing Trump to the expectation of being managed by him. Yet the president, while proposing the most radical departure from governing and policy norms in several generations, had few specific ideas about how to turn his themes and vitriol into policy. And making suggestions to him was deeply complicated. Here, arguably, was the central issue of the Trump presidency, informing every aspect of Trumpian policy and leadership: He didn\u2019t process information in any conventional sense. He didn\u2019t read. He didn\u2019t really even skim. Some believed that for all practical purposes he was no more than semi-\u00adliterate. He trusted his own expertise \u00ad\u2014 no matter how paltry or irrelevant \u2014 more than anyone else\u2019s. He was often confident, but he was just as often paralyzed, less a savant than a figure of sputtering and dangerous insecurities, whose instinctive response was to lash out and behave as if his gut, however confused, was in fact in some clear and forceful way telling him what to do. It was, said Walsh, \u201clike trying to figure out what a child wants.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the second week following the immigration EO, the three advisers were in open conflict with one another. For Walsh, it was a daily process of managing an impossible task: Almost as soon as she received direction from one of the three men, it would be countermanded by one or another of them.\n\n\u201cI take a conversation at face value and move forward with it,\u201d she said. \u201cI put what was decided on the schedule and bring in comms and build a press plan around it \u2026 And then Jared says, \u2018Why did you do that?\u2019 And I say, \u2018Because we had a meeting three days ago with you and Reince and Steve where you agreed to do this.\u2019 And he says, \u2018But that didn\u2019t mean I wanted it on the schedule \u2026\u2019 It almost doesn\u2019t matter what anyone says: Jared will agree, and then it will get sabotaged, and then Jared goes to the president and says, see, that was Reince\u2019s idea or Steve\u2019s idea.\u201d\n\nIf Bannon, Priebus, and Kushner were now fighting a daily war with one another, it was exacerbated by the running disinformation campaign about them that was being prosecuted by the president himself. When he got on the phone after dinner, he\u2019d speculate on the flaws and weaknesses of each member of his staff. Bannon was disloyal (not to mention he always looks like shit). Priebus was weak (not to mention he was short \u2014 a midget). Kushner was a suck-up. Sean Spicer was stupid (and looks terrible too). Conway was a crybaby. Jared and Ivanka should never have come to Washington.\n\nDuring that first month, Walsh\u2019s disbelief and even fear about what was happening in the White House moved her to think about quitting. Every day after that became a countdown toward the moment she knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to take it anymore. To Walsh, the proud political pro, the chaos, the rivalries, and the president\u2019s own lack of focus were simply incomprehensible. In early March, not long before she left, she confronted Kushner with a simple request. \u201cJust give me the three things the president wants to focus on,\u201d she demanded. \u201cWhat are the three priorities of this White House?\u201d\n\nIt was the most basic question imaginable \u2014 one that any qualified presidential candidate would have answered long before he took up residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Six weeks into Trump\u2019s presidency, Kushner was wholly without an answer.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said to Walsh. \u201cWe should probably have that conversation.\u201d\n\nHow He Got the Story This story is adapted from Michael Wolff\u2019s book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, published this month by Henry Holt & Co. on January 9. Wolff, who chronicles the administration from Election Day to this past October, conducted conversations and interviews over a period of 18 months with the president, most members of his senior staff, and many people to whom they in turn spoke. Shortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration, Wolff says, he was able to take up \u201csomething like a semi-permanent seat on a couch in the West Wing\u201d \u2014 an idea encouraged by the president himself. Because no one was in a position to either officially approve or formally deny such access, Wolff became \u201cmore a constant interloper than an invited guest.\u201d There were no ground rules placed on his access, and he was required to make no promises about how he would report on what he witnessed. Since then, he conducted more than 200 interviews. In true Trumpian fashion, the administration\u2019s lack of experience and disdain for political norms made for a hodgepodge of journalistic challenges. Information would be provided off-the-record or on deep background, then casually put on the record. Sources would fail to set any parameters on the use of a conversation, or would provide accounts in confidence, only to subsequently share their views widely. And the president\u2019s own views, private as well as public, were constantly shared by others. The adaptation presented here offers a front-row view of Trump\u2019s presidency, from his improvised transition to his first months in the Oval Office.\n\n*Excerpted from Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House by Michael Wolff (Henry Holt and Co., January 5, 2018).
