The Nordic nations don\u2019t have any of the policies \u2013 government ownership, central planning, or price controls \u2013 that are characteristics of a socialist economy.\n\nBut they do have high taxes and big welfare states. And since some politicians seem to think America should copy those policies, let\u2019s see what we can learn by examining the Nordic nations.\n\nNIma Sanandaji, writing for Foreign Policy, highlights what is good \u2013 and not so good \u2013 about government policy in the region. He starts by looking specifically at Norway.\n\nErlend Kvitrud, a member of the Norwegian Green Party, links democratic socialist economic policies and Nordic countries\u2019 prosperity. \u2026the left has for decades showcased the Nordic nations as proof that socialism can work not only in theory but also in practice. \u2026Inconveniently for fans of the Nordic welfare model, though, Norway\u2019s actual economic success rests on its wealth of natural resources. \u2026Norway\u2019s oil fund is the world\u2019s largest sovereign wealth fund, worth around $200,000 per citizen. It wasn\u2019t Norway\u2019s social democratic economic policies that created the country\u2019s wealth. It was nature. \u2026The other Nordic countries, which lack Norway\u2019s oil and natural gas riches, have lower living standards than the United States.\n\nHe\u2019s certainly correct in highlighting the role of oil wealth in Norway.\n\nAnd he also points out that Norway became a successful and prosperous nation before the welfare state was imposed.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Nordic countries\u2019 social successes predate their high-tax, high-social spending policies. \u2026economists Anthony Barnes Atkinson and Jakob Egholt Sogaard shows that most of the progress toward income inequality in Norway and Sweden happened before 1970, at a time when the two countries had low tax regimes and less redistributive policies. Similarly, the Nordic countries\u2019 social successes were more pronounced in those years. Relative to the rest of the world, for example, they had a greater advantage in life span and child mortality in 1970 than they do today. In other words, the Nordic model arose after those countries were already prosperous and egalitarian.\n\nThese are all good points, but I think Nima actually overlooks one very powerful argument.\n\nYes, per-capita GDP in Norway is very similar to the United States, but gross domestic product is an imperfect measure of living standards. The data in relatively small economies can be misleading if there is a particular sector that distorts national statistics \u2013 such as financial services in Luxembourg or corporations in Ireland.\n\nThat\u2019s why, if you want to measure the prosperity of households, it\u2019s best to review the OECD\u2019s data on \u201cactual individual consumption.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve shared that data for all developed nations in the past, and the Council of Economic Advisers recently did a specific comparison of the United States and Nordic nations.\n\nNorway is still impressive, ranked higher than its neighbors, but not in the same league as the United States.\n\nBy the way, in another article, this time for National Review, Nima explains that America actually has more women in management than any of the Nordic nations.\n\nScience Daily once bluntly stated that \u201cthe Nordic countries are the most gender equal nations in the world.\u201d There is some truth to this. \u2026A common assumption is that the gender-equality progress of the Nordics is due to their social-democratic welfare policies. \u2026The truth is that Nordic countries have a long history of gender equality, stretching back to the time of the Vikings. \u2026One might expect this to translate into many women reaching the top of the business world. But this clearly is not the case. \u2026the share of women among managers, as recorded by the International Labour Organization, is 43 percent in the United States, compared with 36 percent in Sweden and 28 percent in Denmark. \u2026a pattern emerges: Those with more extensive welfare-state policies have fewer women on top. Iceland, which has a moderately sized welfare state, has the most women managers. Second is Sweden, which has opened up welfare services such as education, health care, and elder care for private-sector competition. Denmark, which has the highest taxes and the biggest welfare state in the modern world, has the lowest share of women in managerial positions. \u2026The true lesson, that a large welfare state actually can impede women\u2019s progress.\n\nLet\u2019s return to the big-picture economic comparisons.\n\nProfessor Hannes Gissurason of the University of Iceland authored a report on the Nordic model for the Foundation for European Reform.\n\nIt\u2019s a very detailed study covering lots of issues.\n\nThe five Nordic countries, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Iceland, are rightly regarded as successful societies. They are affluent, but without a wide gap between rich and poor. They provide social security, but without a significant erosion, it seems, of their freedoms. They are small, but they all enjoy a good reputation around the world as peaceful, civilised democracies. The Nordic nations are healthy and well-educated and the crime rate is low. But what is it that other nations can learn from the Nordic success story?\n\nFor today, let\u2019s focus on the third chapter, which look at three distinct eras of Swedish economic history.\n\n\u2026a distinction can be made between three Swedish models. The liberal model was developed in the mid-19th century, when liberal principles of free trade and unfettered competition were generally accepted and implemented in Sweden. The years between 1970 and 1990 were the heyday of the social democratic welfare model, although it had of course started its development much earlier and was to last for a few more years. The third model emerged in the 1990s after the experience of the social democratic model: this was the liberal welfare model.\n\nThe first era, which was based on classical liberal principles of free markets and limited government, is when Sweden became rich.\n\nIt was the liberal model which made Sweden wealthy, as Swedish economist Nima Sanandaji has well documented. Between 1870 and 1936, Sweden enjoyed the highest growth rate in the industrialised world\u2026 What produced the astonishing growth after 1870 was the introduction of economic freedom into a relatively poor society, but with strong traditions of self-reliance, hard work, thriftiness, and respect for the law and a high level of education. Money was sound, with the Swedish krona being on the gold standard\u2026 The environment was friendly to business and taxes were relatively low, even after the Social Democrats took over. In 1955, for example, tax revenues in Sweden, as a proportion of GDP, were the same as in the US, 24%.\n\nThe second era is when Sweden shifted to what some people call democratic socialism, but more accurately should be called the era of big government.\n\nThere were high taxes and lots of redistribution programs. And, not surprisingly, this led to economic stagnation.\n\n\u2026In 1975, tax revenues, as a proportion of GDP, had risen to 39% in Sweden, but was still only 25% in the US\u2026 In 2004, 38 of the largest companies in Sweden were entrepreneurial which means that they had been started as privately owned enterprises within the country. \u2026Only two had been formed after 1970. While the public sector grew, the private sector stagnated. Between 1950 and 2000, the Swedish population grew from seven to almost nine million. Incredibly, the net job creation in the private sector during this period was close to zero. All the new jobs were in the public sector. \u2026Many entrepreneurs left the country, including the founders of IKEA, Tetra Pak, and H&M.\n\nBig government undermines initiative and weakens economic performance.\n\nThe study includes this data on how Swedes get richer in America than they do back home.\n\nAll this bad news created the conditions for the third era, which featured market-based reforms \u2013 regardless of which party or parties were in control of government.\n\nReluctantly, the Social Democrats started some reforms, deregulating credit and foreign exchange markets and changing the tax system, lowering marginal income tax from 73% to 51% and the capital gains tax to 30%. In 1991 a non-socialist government was voted in again. Now it was also anti-socialist, and it immediately abolished the wage earner funds\u2026 energy, postal, telephone, railway, and airline markets were all deregulated. \u2026The government introduced school vouchers, sold stateowned companies, and carried out reforms in the labour market, especially designed for small businesses and private job agencies. The government also allowed for some choice in health care and assistance to the elderly. \u2026when the Social Democrats returned to power in 1994\u2026welfare benefits were cut; a new pension system was established, partly with self-funded pensions; collective bargaining was reformed; the inheritance tax was abolished. The centre-right government which was in power 2006\u20132014 continued liberalising the Swedish economy: the wealth tax was abolished, \u2026property rights were strengthened, and the corporate tax was cut to 22%.\n\nIn other words, for the past twenty or so years, Sweden has been a leader in pro-market reforms.\n\nYes, there\u2019s still a big government. But not as big as it used to be.\n\nYes, there are still high taxes. But not as high as they used to be.\n\nAnd what\u2019s the lesson we can learn?\n\nThis chart is very persuasive. It shows how Swedish prosperity, measured relative to the United States, declined during the era of big government.\n\nBut there\u2019s been some convergence ever since policy makers started liberalizing the Swedish economy.\n\nAnd we see a similar pattern if we compare Sweden to all other industrialized nations.\n\nP.S.
