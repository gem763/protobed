Like with many hits these days, from Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams\u2019s \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d to Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cDark Horse\u201d to Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u201cThinking Out Loud,\u201d the question of authorship and copyright infringement in music has become muddy. And as the cases have multiplied, many are jumping in to claim a piece of a song\u2019s pie. Here\u2019s what to know about Lizzo\u2019s \u2018Truth Hurts.\u2019\n\nWho are the people involved in the \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d case?\n\nIn the case of \u201cTruth Hurts,\u201d three main individuals have made headlines with an interest in establishing themselves on the songwriting credits. They include Mina Lioness, a singer who once tweeted the song\u2019s now-infamous lyric, \u201cI just took a DNA test and I\u2019m 100% that b-tch,\u201d in the spring of 2017, and two songwriting brothers, Justin and Jeremiah Raisen, who wrote a song demo called \u201cHealthy\u201d with Lizzo during a 2017 session.\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake?\n\nSong royalties. With a big hit comes ongoing returns on the song\u2019s profits. Plus, \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d is currently in Grammy contention.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

In order for someone to claim ownership of a phrase or lyric, they need to have established common law copyright over that piece of creative output. \u201cIf you draw a picture in the sand on the beach,\u201d explains entertainment and media lawyer Jason Boyarski of New York-based firm Boyarski Fritz who have counted the Prince estate, Marc Anthony, Wycleaf Jean and Bhad Bhabie among their clients, \u201cthere\u2019s technically a copyright for that picture. It\u2019s creativity, it\u2019s fixed in a medium. [It\u2019s] common law copyright. It hasn\u2019t been registered yet, but it could be protected.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s yours, and could be defensible in court if someone tried to sell it off as their own.\n\nBut it\u2019s often harder to identify the creative distinction of a phrase. It has to meet two standards: it must rise to a \u201clevel of originality\u201d that sets it apart, and it must have been used in the new work in a way that\u2019s \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to its original purpose. (For instance, you can\u2019t just publish someone else\u2019s photo in a book without giving them credit. But if you draw the scene depicted in that photo in a new, distinctive style and publish the drawing, then you\u2019ve repurposed it in a way that no longer requires credit to the original photographer.) \u201cDoes a one-sentence tweet like that, as genius as the concept is, is it original enough to warrant copyright ability just as a sentence?\u201d Boyarski wonders. \u201cFor a songwriter to be liable for some sort of infringement, it has to really rise to a level of really reaping where someone else has sown from an originality standpoint.\u201d\n\nIn this case, Lioness\u2019s claim may have held water \u2014 had she pressed it. \u201cHad she lawyered up, there would be viable arguments on both sides,\u201d suggests Boyarski; there is a case to be made in her favor for a common law copyright on the tweet\u2019s contents. The Raisens, meanwhile, are claiming common law copyright on the lyric as it existed in the prior song they made with Lizzo; they\u2019re arguing that the lyric as it existed in their session deserves its own form of protection, and are suggesting in social media that the melody and chords are also part of the copyright-able mix.\n\nHow has Lizzo responded?\n\nIn a tweet this week, Lizzo confirmed that she\u2019ll be offering Lioness a songwriting credit. \u201cI later learned that a tweet inspired the meme [that inspired the lyric],\u201d she shared. \u201cThe creator of the tweet is the person I am sharing my success with\u2026 not these men. Period.\u201d She then filed suit against the Raisen brothers, according to Variety, claiming harassment.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nEither they will settle or continue to court. If it goes to court, Boyarski suggests the outcome is nowhere near clear; there isn\u2019t a great deal of precedent on claims regarding lyrics, as most of the questions around songs have to do with chord progression and melody. (There may be an infinite number of ways to combine notes, Boyarski reminds us, but only a certain number of those combinations actually sound good to regular listeners \u2014 hence the ways that new music often sounds reminiscent of what we\u2019ve heard before, regardless of the creator\u2019s intent.) And so \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d may just continue to surprise us all.\n\nWhy does this case matter?\n\n\u201cFrom a macro standpoint, the \u2018Blurred Lines\u2019 case opened the floodgates to more voluminous litigation in connection with music publishing and songwriting,\u201d Boyarski says. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous ground right now for songwriters.\u201d What happens with \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d will contribute to determining how future songwriters and collaborators pursue copyright claims. And just like we\u2019ve seen a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on the music industry in the post-\u201cBlurred Lines\u201d decision, this could have a cascading effect as well. \u201cAnybody can make a claim,\u201d Boyarski says. \u201cThe question is, can lyrics of themselves\u2026 have that copyright ability?\u201d We\u2019ll have to see how it plays out.\n\nWrite to Raisa Bruner at raisa.bruner@time.com.", "description": "An entertainment lawyer explains how the controversy around who gets credit for writing Lizzo's \"Truth Hurts\" could unfold in court.", "authors": ["Raisa Bruner"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/lizzotruthhurtsexplained.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
