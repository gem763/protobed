United friendly vs. Puebla", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-03", "text": "\n\nLuciano Acosta, left, has started one of the past five MLS matches, and Wayne Rooney has missed four of eight. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nD.C. United vs. Puebla preview\n\nWhat: Friendly.\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nWhere: Audi Field.\n\nOutlook: With no MLS match this weekend and some regulars needing minutes, Coach Ben Olsen said Wayne Rooney and Luciano Acosta will start against the Mexican club.\n\nRooney, the team\u2019s captain and leading scorer, has missed four of the past eight matches, including the past two because of a red card. Acosta has started one of the previous five.\n\nOlsen will use a mix of regulars, reserves and second-division players from Loudoun United in the last of three friendlies against international foes. Relying on many young players amid busy stretches of league games, D.C. lost to Spain\u2019s Real Betis, 5-2, in May and France\u2019s Olympique Marseille, 8-1, in July.\n\n\u201cA little bit of a puzzle, but it will probably be the best team we put forward for one of these friendlies because of the circumstances,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cWe need the training session for some guys \u2014 meaning 30 minutes or 45 \u2014 and some guys need to get pushed and get real game time. There will be some 90-minute performances.\u201d\n\nRooney returned to Washington on Monday after spending several days in England with family. Acosta entered in the 87th minute of the 3-0 victory Saturday at Montreal.\n\n[Canouse was in right spot for much-needed United victory]\n\nOn how much Rooney and Acosta will play, Olsen added: \u201cYou go into the game scheduling the minutes, then the whistle blows and you have to adapt and still evaluate their fitness. If the data says they are fine, we will keep pushing them.\u201d\n\nSecondary players likely to see time include goalkeeper Chris Seitz, defender Marquinhos Pedroso and winger Emmanuel Boateng, as well as Loudoun-based homegrown Antonio Bustamante. Griffin Yow, the 16-year-old attacker who scored against Real Betis, is nursing a minor ankle injury and is unlikely to play.\n\nWith four league matches left, United (11-10-9, 42 points) is fourth in an Eastern Conference race that will send seven to the postseason. The next league date is Sept. 15 at Portland.\n\nPuebla (1-3-3) is 17th in the 19-team Liga MX following a 1-1 draw at Queretaro on Sunday. Midfielder Alejandro Chumacero was recalled by the Bolivian national team for next Tuesday\u2019s friendly at Ecuador.\n\nRead more:\n\nVirginia knocks off Maryland in match of college soccer titans at Audi Field\n\nAmericans abroad weekend roundup: Josh Sargent, 19, scores brilliant goal in Bundesliga\n\nD.C.
