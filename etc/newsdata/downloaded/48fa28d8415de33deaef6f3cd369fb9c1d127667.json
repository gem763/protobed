I seem to be blocked on Instagram.\"\n\n'And she said no, it was probably one of the kids messing about with her phone that had done it. She was completely convincing.'\n\nThe Mirror also reported that Rebekah asked Coleen if she had 'offended her', to which Coleen 'swore blind she hadn't.\n\nDrama: Speaking to The Daily Mail's Alison Boshoff, the wife of footballer Jamie Vardy, 37, confessed that she noticed Coleen had blocked her on her private Instagram back in March\n\n'Convincing': Rebekah said that she confronted Coleen about her inability to see her private page, to which the wife of Wayne Rooney claimed it was just her kids messing about with her phone\n\nHowever, sources have told the publication that the mother of four knew that merely blocking Rebekah wasn't 'going to cut the mustard' and that she 'needed proof' - hence how her elaborate plan came into fruition.\n\nA source revealed: 'Coleen thinks there are other stories that were passed to the media other than the three mentioned in her public statement. She is sure of it.'\n\nOne such story which was leaked, which she allegedly thinks Rebekah was behind, was of her narrowly avoiding a car crash in January while she was living in the US.\n\nHowever, at the time Coleen took to Twitter to reveal that it wasn't true at all, tweeting: 'Thank you for the messages asking if I am ok... the car crash story was completely wrong.... I wasn\u2019t involved in a crash ...the car was damaged by another car.\n\n'Someone on my private Instagram seen the picture and is telling or selling stories to a certain newspaper.\n\nShock: On Wednesday it was revealed that Coleen had set up an elaborate sting on Instagram for months to 'catch' who was leaking fake stories - leading her to Rebekah's account\n\nLooking back: Now putting two and two together, Rebekah has now reflected on the time seven months ago when Coleen first appeared to be having her doubts with her\n\n'It\u2019s happened several times now over the past couple of years. It\u2019s sad to think Someone, who I have accepted to follow me is betraying for either money or to keep a relationship with the press.'\n\nMeanwhile, a clearly distraught Rebekah has continued to deny that she was behind the Instagram leaks, while also expressing her bewilderment at Coleen's allegations.\n\nAdmitting that she had 'always liked Coleen', Rebekah told The Sun: 'I don\u2019t know why on earth she would do this to me. She said she liked me then hung me out to dry in public.'\n\n'My only issue with her is the way she has gone about doing this to me in public, and causing all of this upset, without speaking to me first in private.\n\n'Why didn\u2019t she pick up the phone? I have been so upset by it \u2013 and I\u2019m heavily pregnant too.'\n\nWAG wars: It's also reported that Rebekah asked Coleen if she had 'offended her', to which Coleen 'swore blind she hadn't\n\nPlan: However, Coleen reportedly knew that merely blocking Rebekah wasn't 'going to cut the mustard' and that she 'needed proof' - hence how her elaborate plan came into fruition\n\nRevealing that 'everyone now hates her', Rebekah has also expressed concerns at the death threats she has been receiving, which tell her that she and her unborn child should die.\n\nRebekah continued to detail her plight to The Daily Mail's Alison, in which she described the tense phone call between the two shortly after Coleen's shock statement came to light.\n\nWhen asked if they argued, Rebekah explained: 'That would be like arguing with a pigeon. You can tell it that you are right and it is wrong, but it's still going to s*** in your hair.'\n\n'It was not an easy phone call. She said to me: \"I'm not pointing the finger\" and I said: \"You have just annihilated me in public and hung me out to dry. The whole world hates me!\"\n\n'Sad that someone's betraying me': Coleen allegedly also believes Rebekah was behind her car crash story in January - which she took to Twitter to clear up\n\n'It's ...... Rebekah Vardy's account': Coleen's dramatic revelation, in which she detailed her investigative work, enthralled the world\n\nTalking about the trolling she has received, Rebekah confessed: 'I am tough, but this has made me cry. It is hard to explain how horrible it has been.'\n\nRebekah was also sure to reveal the extent of her friendship with the Rooney's, claiming: 'We have always got on and that is what makes it all the more difficult. For instance, I messaged her when Wayne was in trouble over the drink-driving. I have been a supportive friend.\n\n'She sent me a gift when my youngest Finlay was born [in January 2017] and I sent her a present when her baby Cass arrived [in February 2018]. There was never any hint of any bad blood between us or any hint that she had a suspicion about me.'\n\nIt has been revealed that Rebekah has hired a team of forensic IT experts to prove her innocence after Coleen accused her of selling stories to the press through information she obtained from her private Instagram.\n\nColeen's dramatic revelation enthralled the world and sparked an angry denial from pregnant Rebekah, who said 'I don't need the money\u2019 and pointed out other people have had access to her Instagram account.\n\nHowever, a spokesman for Coleen said: 'It is irrefutable that the leaks came from one account, and one account only.'", "description": "Rebekah Vardy has revealed that she faced an awkward confrontation with Coleen Rooney months before their shock drama unravelled in the public eye.", "authors": ["Jabeen Waheed For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/00/19564268-0-image-a-136_1570751314178.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
