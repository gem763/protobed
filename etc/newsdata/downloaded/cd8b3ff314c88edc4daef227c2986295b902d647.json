But who doesn\u2019t yearn for an answer?\n\nRiverhead\n\nIf ever a place could claim to be an incubator of rare goodness, Paxson seems to have found it: a small plateau in south-central France called Vivarais-Lignon, where a long tradition of extraordinary kindness to strangers peaked during the Nazi occupation. Town and rural folks risked their lives giving refuge to hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people, many of them Jewish and most of them young. Group homes for children, who arrived from all over Europe, sprang up. A forebear of hers, Paxson discovered, took charge of one in the fall of 1942. Daniel Trocm\u00e9, still a restless soul at 30, seized the chance \u201cnot because it\u2019s an adventure,\u201d he wrote to his parents, \u201cbut so that I would not be ashamed of myself.\u201d\n\nAn anthropologist by training, Paxson hoped that fieldwork among the many rescuers\u2019 descendants might help reveal how a group ethos of \u201cuncommon decency\u201d thrives. But her social-science quest propelled her onto fraught, personal terrain. Trocm\u00e9\u2019s moral odyssey roiled and inspired her. So did a growing need not to analyze, but to engage her \u201cvery own soul,\u201d as she does with asylum seekers who now find refuge in the area. The result is a lyrical book, by turns ungainly and graceful, dark and uplifting\u2014right in step with the struggle \u201cto be good when it\u2019s hard to be good.\u201d", "description": "A small area in France has a long history of extraordinary kindness to strangers.", "authors": ["Ann Hulbert", "Maggie Paxson"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2019/07/CULT_C2C_Plateau/facebook.jpg?1564423889"}
