The number is expected to rise as debt maturities for those looking to cash in on the shale revolution and make bets on higher oil prices years ago are now looming.\n\n\n\n5.7% of all energy companies with junk rated bonds are defaulting as of August, the highest level since 2017. The metric is \"considered a key indicator of the industry\u2019s financial stress.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe defaults are on the rise as companies struggle to service debt, bring in new money and refinance existing debt. The once-darling shale business model has been under significant scrutiny from Wall Street over the last 18 months, adding to the headwinds for many companies.\n\nInvestor interest has faded after years of meager returns while, at the same time, companies struggle to meet their cost of capital with oil prices below $60/barrel.\n\nPrivate companies and smaller drillers have felt the most pain thus far. These companies \"collectively generate a large portion of U.S. oil,\" and their distress is indicative of wider distress throughout U.S. shale.\n\nPatrick Hughes, a partner at Haynes & Boone said: \u201cThey were able to hang in there for a while, but now their debt levels are just too high and they\u2019re going to have to take their medicine.\u201d\n\nRelated: OPEC Abandons \u2018\u2019Whatever It Takes Strategy\u2019\u2019, Boosts Production\n\n\n\n\n\nHalcon filed for bankruptcy in August, just three years after it last filed for bankruptcy, due to a production slowdown in West Texas and higher than expected processing costs. The company's chief restructuring officer (which we guess is probably becoming somewhat of a permanent position after filing bankruptcy twice in 3 years) said the bankruptcy was partly a result of lenders cutting the company's credit line by $50 million earlier this year after it violated its debt covenants due to too much leverage.\n\nSanchez Energy also filed for bankruptcy in August, citing falling energy prices and a dispute with Blackstone over assets that were jointly acquired from Anadarko Petroleum in 2017. Blackstone said Sanchez defaulted on a joint deal to develop the assets and, as a result, Blackstone was entitled to take them over.\n\nOther shale drillers, like EP Energy Corp., have also missed debt payments. EP missed a $40 million interest payment due August 15 as it continued to struggle from the debt piled atop of it as a result of an Apollo-led buyout in 2012.\n\nAs of Q2 2019, the company had debt to the tune of 6x its EBITDA. The company has said it has to mid-September to make the payment and is considering a \"range of options\", including bankruptcy, to deal with the issue.\n\nRelated: US Rig Count Slides But Oil Prices Can't Catch A Break\n\nStory continues", "description": "Financial stress in the shale patch is rising fast as a huge number of junk bonds is set to mature and investors are running for the exit as cash flows continue to disappoint", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qWqSl1zJoVayEArucC3mbg--~B/aD04Mzg7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/oilprice.com/9c57784802630d93a1a009141cbee4d5"}
