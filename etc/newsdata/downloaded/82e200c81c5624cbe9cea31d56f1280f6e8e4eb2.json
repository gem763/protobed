Police fired tear gas and baton-charged the crowds, while some demonstrators threw bricks and petrol bombs at police as night fell.\n\nProtesters concealed their faces in defiance of colonial-era emergency laws invoked by the authorities on Friday, which banned face masks. Protesters face a maximum of one year in jail for breaking the mask ban.\n\nPolice made their first arrests under the new rules, detaining scores of people. Officers tied their wrists with cable and unmasked their faces before placing them on buses. Some protesters lay in foetal positions on the ground, their wrists tied behind their backs, after being subdued with pepper spray and batons.\n\n\u201cThe anti-mask law just fuels our anger and more will people come on to the street,\u201d Lee, a university student wearing a blue mask, said on Sunday, as he marched on Hong Kong island.\n\n\u201cWe are not afraid of the new law, we will continue fighting. We will fight for righteousness. I put on the mask to tell the government that I\u2019m not afraid of tyranny.\u201d\n\nChinese military personnel standing on the roof of the PLA\u2019s Osborn Barracks in Kowloon Tong district held up a sign in English and Chinese which read: \u201cWarning. You are in breach of the law. You may be prosecuted.\u201d\n\nThe troops in fatigues also shone spotlights on the crowd and used binoculars and cameras to monitor protesters. The protesters, several thousand of whom passed the barracks, eventually dispersed.\n\nIn August, Beijing moved thousands of troops across the border into Hong Kong in an operation state news agency Xinhua described at the time as a routine \u201crotation\u201d.\n\nBut the PLA has remained in barracks since protests started, leaving Hong Kong\u2019s police force to deal with the massive and often violent protests in the Asian financial hub.\n\nRiot police detain a protester during an anti-government rally in central Hong Kong, China October 6, 2019. REUTERS/Jorge Silva\n\nThe PLA\u2019s top brass has warned violence is \u201cabsolutely impermissible\u201d.\n\nMORE VIOLENCE\n\nAuthorities had braced for major protests on Sunday, fearing a recurrence of Friday night\u2019s violent protests which saw the Asian financial center virtually shut down the next day.\n\nOnly hours after Hong Kong\u2019s embattled leader Carrie Lam invoked emergency powers last used more than 50 years ago, mask-wearing protesters took to the streets on Friday, setting subway stations on fire, smashing mainland China banks and clashing with police.\n\nThe rallies on Sunday on Hong Kong island and across the harbor in Kowloon had been largely peaceful until police moved to disperse the crowds, saying they were participating in unlawful assemblies, blocking major roads, and ordered protesters to leave immediately.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s four months of protests have plunged the Chinese-ruled city into its worst political crisis in decades and pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power six years ago.\n\nWhat started as opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill has swelled into a pro-democracy movement against what is seen as Beijing\u2019s increasing grip on the city, undermining its \u201cone country, two systems\u201d status promised when Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997.\n\nChina dismisses the accusation, saying foreign governments, including Britain and the United States, have fanned anti-China sentiment.\n\nProtesters on Sunday chanted \u201cHong Kongers, revolt\u201d and \u201cFight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong\u201d, as riot police monitored them from overhead walkways and footbridges, some taking photographs and filming the marchers.\n\nProtesters handed out face masks to encourage people to defy the ban. As the day wore on protesters started to target subway stations and China banks, just as they did on Friday, which forced the unprecedented closure of the city\u2019s metro railway.\n\nA branch of China Construction Bank (Asia) near Prince Edward train station was vandalized on Sunday with \u201cNo China\u201d sprayed on its wall. A metro station in the nightlife district of Wan Chai had a sheet draped over it which read: \u201cThis way to HELL\u201d.\n\nProtesters set a fire at the Mong Kok MTR station, with a placard nearby reading: \u201cIf we burn, you burn with us\u201d.\n\nSlideshow (26 Images)\n\nThe current \u201cprecarious situation\u201d, which endangered public safety, left no timely solution but the anti-mask law, Matthew Cheung, Hong Kong\u2019s chief secretary, wrote on his blog on Sunday. He urged people to oppose violence ahead of grassroots district council elections set for Nov. 24.\n\nFour months of protests have pushed the Asian financial hub to the brink of its first recession in a decade. Financial Secretary Paul Chan in a blog on Sunday said despite recent obstacles, the banking system remained sound and the financial market was functioning well.\n\n\u201cHong Kong will not implement foreign exchange controls. The Hong Kong dollar can be exchanged freely and capital can come in and out freely. This is the solemn guarantee of the Basic Law,\u201d said Chan.", "description": "Chinese soldiers issued a warning to Hong Kong protesters on Sunday who shone lasers at their barracks in the city, in the first direct interaction with mainland military forces in four months of anti-government demonstrations.", "authors": ["James Pomfret", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437805653&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF950KV", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
