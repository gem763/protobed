Put on hold? Or blocked for probably some sports political reasons? I don\u2019t know exactly why,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut we will bring it back on the table until it will be approved.\u201d\n\nInfantino also said he wanted to see an annual Club World Cup for women\u2019s teams to boost the game outside of the national team structures.\n\n\u201cWe need to create a World Cup for clubs. We cannot think that we can seriously develop women\u2019s football by only having national teams,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe need clubs as well and to give them more reason to invest and to give them a stage where they can perform. So I will propose a Club World Cup. Every year, starting next year or the year after next. I don\u2019t think it takes us a long time to organise it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe FIFA head said that the format would see 16 or 24 clubs playing in a tournament of three-to-four weeks and the host nation would be rotated globally.", "description": "FIFA president Gianni Infantino says he will push again for the creation of a Women's World League despite having his initial plan blocked inside the organisation.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432679245&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0MS", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
