USA TODAY\n\nNFL power rankings, post-Week 6 edition:\n\n1. Patriots (1): Defense already has 14 INTs, three more than even Baker Mayfield. Should be lots of possession changes when Bake comes to Foxborough in two weeks.\n\n2. Saints (2): When you're getting a shoutout from the Pope \u2014 intentional or not \u2014 sure seems like you're in midst of a season that could prove special.\n\n3. Packers (5): Unheralded guys like Jamaal Williams and Allen Lazard stepped up in key spots to propel banged-up Pack to 5-1 start. Sign of a very formidable team.\n\n4. 49ers (6): Despite 5-0 start, Jimmy Garoppolo has been uneven. Once he's had more time to grow with unfamiliar receivers, Niners could really flourish.\n\n5. Texans (18): They've won four of five and are suddenly keeping Deshaun Watson clean and upright. Might they be New England's primary challenger in AFC?\n\n32 things we learned: From Week 6 of the 2019 NFL season\n\nWeek 6 winners, losers: Cowboys at a crossroads while Chiefs searching for answers\n\nMore: Trades might not solve the Eagles problems at cornerback, wide receiver\n\n6. Chiefs (3): Not only are they allowing nearly 200 rush yards per game over last month, no defense has allowed more first downs. What's Mahomes supposed to do?\n\n7. Vikings (9): They've won three of four, and Kirk Cousins has seven TD passes, one INT and a 121.0 QB rating in that time. What was everyone spun up about?\n\n8. Seahawks (11): Russell Wilson is on his way to bypassing Aaron Rodgers as highest-rated QB ever. MVP front runner has been 100-plus in every game of 2019.\n\n9. Bills (8): Coming out of bye, their next three are at home, none against opponent with a winning record. Very good chance Buffalo ends up around 11 or 12 wins.\n\n10. Lions (4): Detroit was mere seconds away from claiming first place in NFL's toughest division. Instead, Lions get sunk by mental errors and bad calls \u2014 feel free to send officials a hefty fine in a FedEx envelope this week, Trey Flowers.\n\n11. Eagles (7): Turnovers telling tale of this team. When Philly has two or more, it hasn't won. But limit giveaways to one or fewer, and Iggles 3-0.\n\n12. Panthers (17): Kyle Allen has won in Arizona, Houston, Charlotte and London this season. The big question now is, has he permanently won Cam Newton's job?\n\n13. Raiders (19): Speaking of \"Browns\" Oakland signed in 2019, Derek Carr recently said, \"My favorite Brown was obviously Trent.\" Josh Jacobs likely agrees.\n\n14. Bears (10): Coming out of bye, club currently just outside playoff picture hits brutal stretch with just two of final 11 opponents currently below .500.\n\n15. Colts (12): Coming out of bye, club currently just outside playoff picture hits crucial stretch with four of five at Lucas Oil. First up, the Texans.\n\n16. Ravens (16): Lamar Jackson has already staked claim as one of most devastating running QBs ever. He's on pace to rush for 1,227 yards, which would smash Michael Vick's record (1,039 yards) for a passer. Jackson just became first player in regular-season history to pass for 200 yards and rush for 150 in same game.\n\n17. Buccaneers (14): Per Bruce Arians, Jameis Winston \"has a habit of trying to be Superman\" following his six-turnover day. Lotta kryptonite in the NFL.\n\n18. Rams (15): Since end of 2018 regular season, Jared Goff hasn't thrown more than two TDs in a game, and his passer rating has exceeded 85 just once.\n\n19. Cowboys (13): Troubling aspect of latest loss was Zeke Elliott's solid day. First time Dallas has lost in 13 games when RB's posted 150 or more yards from scrimmage.\n\n20. Steelers (27): Rookie LB Devin Bush pretty clearly worth draft day move, already owning league-high six takeaways \u2014 which is more than seven NFL teams.\n\n21. Jaguars (21): Minshew Mania hit wall Sunday as rookie QB turned in worst performance of season \u2014 by far. Nothing a visit to Cincinnati shouldn't fix.\n\n22. Browns (23): Does Baker Mayfield have more commercials (seemingly infinite) or INTs (NFL-high 11)? Will likely be inversely proportionate moving forward.\n\n23. Broncos (25): Offense has been steadily fading over past three weeks, but defense has picked up pace with 12 sacks and six takeaways over same stretch.\n\n24. Chargers (20): Poor Bolts, playing in front of sea of Steelers fans \u2014 at \"home\" \u2014 on Sunday night. Next game in L.A. is against Green Bay, so home-field disadvantage could actually grow.\n\n25. Giants (24): Even while severely undermanned, they gave Pats all they could handle for three quarters. One game back, don't count G-Men out of NFC East race.\n\n26. Cardinals (28): Look who's on a mini win streak. However most compelling angle around this team now is whether they'll trade reinstated Patrick Peterson.\n\n27. Jets (30): Even inspired to win by Sam Darnold's return, they still have fewest yards, first downs and points per drive of any team. Next up? The Pats in prime time.\n\n28. Titans (22): Welp, they're tied for fewest turnovers in league. It's about only nice thing you can say about an offense that's otherwise completely disappeared.\n\n29. Falcons (26): Don't blame this on Matt Ryan, who has NFL-best 15 TD passes and can become first player to start season with seven straight 300-yard passing days.\n\n30. Redskins (31): They fire their coach but, according to ESPN, won't search for Jay Gruden's replacement until after the season? Sure, why not squander the truly significant advantage of a midseason termination \u2014 it's the Redskin Way.\n\n31. Bengals (29): How about this stat to perfectly explain their league-worst 0-6 record \u2014 Cincinnati is getting outrushed by 128 yards a week.\n\n32. Dolphins (32): They've generated just two turnovers \u2014 one-third of what Pittsburgh's Bush has managed alone. But they make up for it by collecting just five sacks ... which is fewer than seven players.\n\n(Previous ranking in parentheses)\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
