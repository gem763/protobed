He responded to another Labour MP by saying: \u201cThe best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox, and indeed to bring this country together, would be, I think, to get Brexit done.\u201d\n\nIn Westminster, politics is far too often seen as a clever game where opponents set traps for one another. These traps usually have a single aim: To make the other less popular with the public.\n\nIn the context of Brexit, this has got nasty and personal. The two main parties and their leaders embody the polar opposites of each other\u2019s values. And this has bred genuine animosity.\n\nBritish politics has never been more divided and it\u2019s easy to see the temptation of leaning into this sincere disdain when campaigning against a rival.\n\nMany politicians claim their motivation for working in politics is to change the lives of ordinary people. But it does at times seem forgotten that what is said in Westminster is heard out in the real world.\n\nEarlier this year, Lyra McKee, a journalist in Northern Ireland, was murdered by a terrorist group called the New IRA while covering a sectarian clash. While no one is claiming that Brexit was the cause of this murder, it\u2019s hard to argue that the instability of Brexit didn\u2019t create the perfect conditions for this conflict to take place.\n\nSince the Brexit referendum, a number of MPs have received near-constant streams of abuse on social media for their stances on Brexit. This abuse has ranged from harassment to outright threats of rape and murder. These threats often mirror the language heard in the House of Commons.\n\nThe abuse crosses the political spectrum. Earlier this year, in a bizarre new trend, right-wing politicians had milkshakes thrown over them and videos of the attacks were posted to social media. This might seem light-hearted fun, but being on the receiving end of it is doubtless terrifying. And in such a toxic atmosphere, it\u2019s easy to see how quickly these things could escalate.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be a controversial opinion, but it\u2019s worth saying: If the friend of someone who was murdered in an overtly political attack tells you that they fear your language is creating an atmosphere that could lead to a similar attack, you should probably just listen. Even if you disagree. Especially if you are the Prime Minister.", "description": "UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been met with an angry backlash after Parliament returned to work, while the Brexit debate descends into chaos.", "authors": ["Analysis Cnn'S Luke Mcgee"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190924084913-boris-johnson-unga-0923-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
