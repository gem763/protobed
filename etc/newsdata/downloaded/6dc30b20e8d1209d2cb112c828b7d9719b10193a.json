Brady, Foxx, Walden: Speaker Pelosi, together with Dems, we can lower drug prices -- Let's get to work", "language": "en", "text": "The cost of prescription drugs is way too high. Tracy Bush, a 45-year-old mother and an active and accomplished food allergy blogger from Pfafftown, North Carolina, knows this firsthand. Tracy always has two EpiPens on her. Her son, age 17 now, carries another. This practice began when he was diagnosed with serious allergies as a 2-year-old. This is life for Tracy, and for thousands of other parents across America.\n\nBut when a drug company charges $1,819.08 for three EpiPen two-packs \u2013 and the medicine in the device costs only a few dollars \u2013 alarm bells go off.\n\nSince 2008, the price of EpiPens has skyrocketed by over 400 percent. Over the same time period the CEO of Mylan Pharmaceuticals, the maker of EpiPen, saw her salary go from $2.4 million to $18.9 million \u2013 a 671 percent increase. Tracy has felt the impact. Over the course of nine years, she saw a two-pack go from $146 to over $600.\n\nREP. SCALISE RIPS NANCY PELOSI FOR CONDUCTING IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY 'IN SECRET AND BEHIND CLOSED DOORS'\n\nYou see this gross inequality and emotion immediately rushes in \u2013 a mix of anger, frustration, and desperation. You know\u2014we know\u2014this is not fair. This is why the American people say lowering prescription drug costs should be a major health care priority for Congress. We are the top Republicans on the three Congressional committees that work on health care and we agree. We hear you.\n\nAmericans pay too much for prescription drugs under the current system. It is not fair. That\u2019s why Republicans have pushed for legislation to increase competition, transparency, and accountability so people pay less at the counter for their prescriptions.\n\nHouse Democrats\u2019 obsession with impeachment since November 8, 2016, is leading us down a path to have the least productive Congress in recent history, leaving us with no progress on an issue that more than 70 percent of Americans want Congress to address.\n\nUnder Republican leadership, we worked with our fellow Democrats to make real progress. The 21st Century Cures Act was passed in 2016 \u2013 an innovation game-changer for medical research while also speeding up access to treatments for patients.\n\nThen in 2017, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) Reauthorization Act was signed into law leading to the approval of 971 generics, or copies of brand name drug, including the first generic version of the EpiPen. Congress saw a problem, put aside politics, and made progress for families like Tracy Bush.\n\nWe started to do that this year, too. Republicans and Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee moved three significant and bipartisan bills to the U.S. House floor in May. The CREATES Act, Pay for Delay, and the BLOCKING Act each removed barriers for generic drugs to get to consumers faster \u2013 pushing back on bad behavior from big pharmaceutical companies gaming the system and preventing competition. These policies would help bring down drug prices at the counter \u2013 an obvious win for the American people.\n\nEnter Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The Speaker of the House opted to discard months of bipartisan work to put politics over progress. This Washington Post headline nailed it, \u201cDemocrats are putting a political pothole in the way of bipartisan drug pricing bills.\u201d She snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, forsaking a bipartisan win on lowering drug prices for the American people.\n\nRepublicans were not deterred; we went back to work. Republicans and Democrats started working to modernize the already successful Medicare Part D program, which covers prescription drugs for seniors.\n\nThe Bush-era law has been a major success, with premiums falling to the lowest levels since 2013. A bipartisan deal was being negotiated to provide further benefit for seniors \u2013 including for the first time, ever, an out-of-pocket cap on their drug expenses.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nLike clockwork, Speaker Pelosi entered the fray with her partisan drug pricing scheme \u2013 written behind closed doors. The Speaker\u2019s drug plan attempts to nationalize the prescription drug industry through foreign price controls, retroactive tax penalties, arbitrary inflation caps, and federally mandated \u201cnegotiations,\u201d which amount to nothing more than government extortion and price-setting. And as for Medicare Part D modernization? Once Speaker Pelosi\u2019s plan was introduced, bipartisan negotiations ceased, making clear the Democrats\u2019 position is their way or the highway. Bad news for seniors.\n\nWe want to work with Democrats to lower drug prices, but the Speaker\u2019s partisan policies will not work. For one, they could lead to higher prices for consumers. Not lower. These policies would lead to limits on access, making prescription drugs less available. Not more. And these policies will freeze innovation, reducing the investment in advanced treatments to cure serious illnesses \u2013 like Alzheimer\u2019s and cancer. We will not see the next generation of cures, and Americans will suffer because of it.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHouse Democrats\u2019 obsession with impeachment since November 8, 2016, is leading us down a path to have the least productive Congress in recent history, leaving us with no progress on an issue that more than 70 percent of Americans want Congress to address. But there is still time to right the ship. We\u2019re asking our colleagues, please work with us on solutions that can actually become law.\n\nWe can lower drug prices for seniors, workers, and families to help the American people if we work together; it does not have to be this way, Madame Speaker.\n\nReps.
