Another testified that the same teacher would touch her legs and buttocks, while the fourth pupil testified that the teacher touched her breasts.\n\nThe alleged incidents happened at a primary school in Mpumalanga between 2016 and 2018.\n\nThe ELRC dismissed the offender this month.\n\nHis name, according to the ELRC award \u2013 seen by City Press \u2013 was forwarded to the department of social development for the offender to be deemed unsuitable to work with children.\n\nCindy Foca, ELRC general secretary, said on Friday that the council had also submitted similar awards of offenders found guilty of sexual misconduct to the SA Council for Educators (Sace), a regulatory body for teachers with the power to blacklist offenders.\n\nLast year the Sace released a report which detailed that between 2016 and 2017, more than 90 incidents of sexual misconduct involving teachers, including rape\n\n\u201cThe council has submitted 22 awards to date. In addition, it submitted the awards to the department of social development for the names of these teachers to be included in the National Child Protection Register,\u201d Foca said.\n\nThis comes amid shocking statistics released in Parliament by Ella Mokgalane, Sace CEO, last week that sexual abuse by teachers on pupils had risen by more than 230% since 2014.\n\nThemba Ndhlovu, Sace spokesperson, also told City Press on Friday that over the past two years, KwaZulu-Natal had recorded the highest number of reported sexual assault cases by teachers on pupils, with a total of 19 reported cases in 2017/18 and 21 in 2018/19.\n\nGauteng came second, with 13 reported in 2017/18 and 21 in 2018/19.\n\nNdhlovu said these shocking statistics were also due to an increase in reporting of cases.\n\nA countrywide scourge A teacher-in-training at Volkskool Orania in Orania, Northern Cape, was arrested after allegations of statutory rape. The teacher is out on bail and has been barred from accessing school premises.\n\nIn the Eastern Cape, a teacher was suspended last month for allegedly raping a six-year-old pupil at Khoto Primary in Lusikisiki.\n\n\n\nAlso last month, a teacher was suspended in KwaZulu-Natal for allegedly exchanging explicit sexual text messages with a pupil at Tongaat Secondary in Tongaat.\n\n\n\nA teacher at Queens High School in Johannesburg was suspended following allegations of sexual abuse made by current and former pupils at the school.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith more and more people becoming aware of Sace, there is an increased reporting of cases. However, this does not mean that there is increased abuse. In the past, there were cases of sexual abuse but they were under-reported,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe added that although most of the reported cases of sexual assault were carried out by teachers aged 45-54, younger teachers were also liable.\n\nLast year the Sace released a report which detailed that between 2016 and 2017, more than 90 incidents of sexual misconduct involving teachers, including rape\u201a were reported.\n\nThe organisation, which aims to enhance the status of the teaching profession through appropriate registration and management of professional development, subsequently announced that as of January this year, new teachers registering with them have to present a police clearance certificate.\n\n\u201cEvery person coming to register with us, or update his or her details on the system \u2013 or even a person coming to renew his or her registration \u2013 is expected to present a police clearance certificate,\u201d Ndhlovu said.\n\nHe conceded that this was not a foolproof plan, but said it was a step in the right direction.\n\nBesides the law taking its course in relation to teachers found guilty of sexual misconduct, Ndhlovu said it was imperative to ensure that such individuals never taught again.\n\n\u201cIf a teacher is found guilty of sexual assault against a pupil, the teacher\u2019s name gets removed from the roll of teachers. Their name gets submitted to the department of social development and is listed on the register of persons unfit to work with children. The name of the teacher is also submitted to his or her employer. In the event that the teacher is still employed, he or she is deemed to have resigned as of the date of the removal of their name from the roll by Sace. The employer is obligated to terminate the teacher\u2019s employment in terms of section 15(2) of the Sace Act,\u201d explained Ndhlovu.\n\nHe added that although most of the pupils reporting sexual assaults had been girls, there were also a few cases reported by boys.\n\nTALK TO US\n\nShould teachers found guilty of sexual misconduct be banned from teaching for life, or should they be allowed to resume teaching if they agree to rehabilitate themselves by undergoing therapy?\n\nSMS us on 35697 using the keyword TEACHERS and tell us what you think.
