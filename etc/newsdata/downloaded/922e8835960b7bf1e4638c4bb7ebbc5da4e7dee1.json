USA TODAY\n\nEnough about pumpkin spice. There's another fall treat people have strong opinions about: candy corn.\n\nThe triangle-shaped, tri-colored candy is either welcomed with open arms by fans every October, or vilified to the point that its haters would rather destroy candy corn in all forms before ever letting it enter their mouths.\n\nAccording to the National Confectioners Association, it is one of the top two Halloween treats, along with chocolate.\n\nA recent poll conducted by Monmouth University found among the eight top-selling candies in the U.S., candy corn tied for fourth with Hershey bars, trailing Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, Snickers and M&M's.\n\n\"Candy corn even making the list may surprise some people, but it is one of the top-selling Halloween candies in the country,\" said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute.\n\ncandy corn (Photo: Sian Cox / EyeEm, Getty Images/EyeEm)\n\nCandy corn is popular enough that it even makes appearances outside Halloween, such as Christmas or Valentine's Day.\n\nHere's everything you have ever wanted to know about candy corn, including why some of us hate it so much.\n\nHow long have we consumed candy corn?\n\nThe treat dates back to the 1800s, although no one has been able to pinpoint who specifically invented the candy corn. The National Confectioners Association says \"according to legend,\" George Renninger, an employee of the Wunderlee Candy Company, created candy corn in the 1880s.\n\nProduction of candy corn took off in 1898 by Ohio-based Goelitz Confectionary Company, which we know now as Jelly Belly (makers of jelly beans with flavors such as caramel corn and, umm, canned dog food).\n\nHow does it get made?\n\nThe NCA says manufacturers use a corn starch molding process where \"kernel-shaped depressions are made in a tray of corn starch.\" The molds are filled in three passes: first pouring the white part of the candy corn, followed by orange, then yellow. When it sets, a confectioner's glaze is added to make them look shiny.\n\nBecause there was no machinery to automate candy corn making when it was first invented, the treats were made seasonally, starting in August and ending around fall, says the NCA.\n\nHow do people eat candy corn?\n\nA survey conducted this year by the NCA found 58% of people just pop the whole candy corn in their mouth. However, 29% will start by eating the narrow white tip at the top, while 13% will eat the yellow portion at the bottom first.\n\nSo, why do some people hate it so much?\n\ncandy corn:\n\n\u2022 candle-flavored\n\n\u2022 trash food\n\n\n\npotatoes:\n\n\u2022 exemplary\n\n\u2022 apples of the earth\n\n\u2022 boil em mash em stick em in a stew \u2014 the library haunter \ud83e\udd89\ud83c\udf83 (@SketchesbyBoze) October 9, 2019\n\nCandy corn is just recycled candles. \u2014 Dadman Walking (@dadmann_walking) October 10, 2019\n\nIf you've noticed recent chatter about candy corn hatred, it's likely linked to a recent survey claiming candy corn was named America's least-favorite Halloween candy.\n\nJacob Lahne, a sensory scientist with the food science and technology department at Virginia Tech, said because candy corn has been around so long, it's possible critics might find it \"a little old-fashioned\" compared to modern treats with more sophisticated flavors.\n\n\"It's so intense, so sweet and so kind of one-note that I think it contrasts with current trends to add bitterness, to add salt, to add spice (or) other complexifying factors,\" he said.\n\nJoe Marcy, the head of the food science and technology department at Virginia Tech, says it could be related to the candy's texture.\n\nBrands of candy corn use varying ingredients to help with texture, Marcy said, including gelatin, egg whites, modified soy protein or carnauba wax.\n\nIn food science, while taste definitely matters, the \"mouthfeel\" \u2014 how food feels when it's in our mouths \u2014 is just as important, said Marcy. \"The flavor may not be what\u2019s putting me off, it may be the texture.\"\n\nHow has candy corn lasted for more than 100 years?\n\nChristopher Gindlesperger, a spokesperson for the National Confectioners Association, said a lot of our love for sweets, including candy corn, comes from their connection to special events like Halloween.\n\n\"It\u2019s very personal,\" said Gindlesperger. \"There\u2019s an emotional well-being component to the products generally, and they\u2019re so closely tied to our family traditions and holiday celebrations.\"\n\nThe fact that we typically only eat candy corn for a brief time also helps, too. Marcy compares it to the Christmas season and the appearance of eggnog near the end of every year.\n\n\"If you had eggnog year-round, you would probably never drink eggnog,\" said Marcy. \"But if it was something that was a special treat associated with a specific holiday, yeah, i\u2019m going to buy some candy corn, and for the month of October, I\u2019m going to eat it.\"\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/11/candy-corn-why-americans-love-hate-halloween-candy/3941252002/", "description": "Here's everything you have ever wanted to know about candy corn, including why some of us hate the Halloween candy so much.", "authors": ["Brett Molina", "Published P.M.
