We feel so lucky that he agreed to come help us tell this lyrical story within a story,\u201d executive producer Chris Hollier said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very excited that Jason will be joining us for a multi-episode arc. It\u2019s only fitting that he\u2019s playing a (currently top secret) character with deep ties to Roswell, New Mexico\u2019s history. Working with him has already been such a special experience for all of us \u2014 particularly when (Roswell co-star) Shiri Appleby was on set to direct him. I was such a huge fan of Roswell as a kid, so having their stamp of approval \u2014 not to mention their expertise and advice \u2014 has really meant the world to me, the cast and the crew,\u201d added executive producer Carina Adly MacKenzie.\n\nRoswell ran three seasons 1999-2002.\n\nSeason 1 of the re-imagining of the show debuted in January. It stars Jeanine Mason, Nathan Parsons, Michael Vlamis, Lily Cowles and Heather Hemmens.", "description": "Oct. 6 (UPI) \u2014 New York Friday Night Lights alum Gaius Charles and Jason Behr, one of the stars of the original Roswell series, will play recurring", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
