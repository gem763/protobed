He added the forecast is conservative.\n\nGE\u00b4s chief financial officer, Jamie Miller, said GE still expects \"the year to be impacted to the tune of about negative $1.4 billion.\" She said it was \"difficult to predict\" the financial impact on GE in 2020 and beyond.\n\nBoeing has said it expects the jet to clear approval by U.S. regulators by year-end.
