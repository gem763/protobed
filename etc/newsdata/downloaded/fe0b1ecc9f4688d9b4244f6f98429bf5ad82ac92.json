It is time to send a message to corporate America: If you do not end your greed and corruption, we will end it for you.\u201d\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen.

CEOs today on average make 278 times more than their workers. In 1965 a CEO was only making 20 times more.\n\nSanders\u2019 plan would target this pay gap and impose taxes on companies which exceed the ratio of CEO to median worker pay of 50:1. If the CEO isn\u2019t the highest-paid employee, the ratio will be based on whomever that person is in the company.\n\nTax penalties would begin at 0.5% for companies that have between 50 to 100 times more and then escalate up to those who make 500 times worker pay (which would be 5%). The tax would apply to both private and public companies that have an annual revenue of more than $100 million.\n\n\u201cThe US has already tried taxing CEO pay and it hasn\u2019t worked,\u201d Adam Michel, a senior policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told Yahoo Finance in a statement. \u201cBusinesses pay their employees what the market demands and levying new taxes on high pay will just make US businesses less able to compete globally, expand their workforces, or raise wages of rank and file workers. Policies that are actually designed to help low-income Americans should focus on removing barriers to success and increasing business investment.\u201d\n\nThe Sanders press release argued that if this plan were in place last year, Walmart would\u2019ve paid around $794 million more in taxes. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) would\u2019ve paid nearly $992 million more. This CEO tax would raise an estimated $150 billion \u201cover the next decade,\u201d the Sanders team statement estimates and would \u2014 along with the wealth tax \u2014 provide funding towards Sanders\u2019 plan to eliminate medical debt.\n\n(Source: EPI) More\n\nThe highest-paid CEOs relative to workers\n\nA separate report by the Institute for Policy Studies \u2014 which Sanders referenced in his statement \u2014 singled out those with the largest pay gaps.\n\nTesla (TSLA) has the biggest CEO-to-worker pay gap at 40,668 times. Other companies with major pay disparities include Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), Gap (GPS), Mattel (MAT), Chipotle (CMG), and McDonald\u2019s (MCD).", "description": "Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is going after CEOs with huge pay relative to their company\u2019s regular workers.", "authors": ["Adriana Belmonte", "Aarthi Swaminathan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KFFq0Gh2WkCAy8255gxQPQ--~B/aD01NTA0O3c9ODI1NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/7a4a2ae0-e384-11e9-979e-1214adf1dec6", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
