Now, it\u2019s poised to enter a small but growing class startups in the \u2018Silicon Slopes\u2019 to garner \u2018unicorn\u2019 status.\n\nThe business announced a $70 million Series D last week at a valuation of $970 million. Tiger Global Management led the round, with participation from existing backers Catalyst Investors, Bessemer Venture Partners, Crosslink Capital, Pelion Venture Partners and LeadEdge Capital.\n\nThe company was founded in 2011 and fully bootstrapped until enrolling in the Silicon Valley accelerator program five years ago. Since then, it\u2019s raised a total of $156 million in private funding, tripling its valuation with the latest infusion of capital.\n\n\u201cOur aim with this funding round is to exceed our customers\u2019 expectations at every touchpoint, investing heavily in the products we create, the markets we serve and the overall customer experience we provide,\u201d Weave co-founder and chief executive officer Brandon Rodman said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to invest in our customers, our products and our people to build a solid, sustainable, and scalable business.\u201d\n\nWeave charges its customers, small and medium-sized businesses, upwards of $500 per month for access to its Voice Over IP-based unified communications service. Rodman previously launched a scheduling service for dentists and realized the opportunity to integrate texting, phone service, fax and reviews to facilitate the patient-provider relationship.\n\nWhile his second effort, Weave, has long been targeting the dentistry and optometry market, Rodman told Venture Beat last year the opportunities for the company are endless: \u201cUltimately, if a business needs to communicate with their customer, we see that as a possible future customer of Weave.\u201d\n\nBased in Lehi, Weave added 250 employees this year with total headcount now reaching 550. The company claims to have doubled its revenue in 2018, too. While we don\u2019t have any real insight into its financials, given the interest it\u2019s garnered amongst Bay Area investors, we\u2019re guessings it\u2019s posting some pretty attractive numbers.\n\n\u201cWeave has some of the best retention numbers we\u2019ve ever seen for an SMB SaaS company,\u201d Catalyst partner Tyler Newton said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re continually impressed by their accelerated growth and results.\u201d", "description": "Patient communications software provider, Weave, collects $70M at a $970M valuation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/weave.jpeg?w=712", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
