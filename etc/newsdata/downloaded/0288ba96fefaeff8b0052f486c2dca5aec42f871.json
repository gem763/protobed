Oh sure, you don\u2019t have to be an elderly person to enjoy the fruits of Toyota\u2019s latest output, but it\u2019ll certainly help. Chiefly because this \u2018Ultra-compact Battery Electric Vehicle\u2019 is specifically designed to support that demographic.\n\nThe BEV is but a two-seater, with a tiny footprint, a tiny top speed of 37mph, a tight turning circle and a tiny range of 62 miles on one charge specifically designed to cater for \u201cJapan\u2019s ageing society\u201d. It is, basically, a small electric pod.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to offer customers a vehicle that not only allows for greater autonomy, but also takes up less space, creates less noise and limits environmental impact,\u201d says Toyota.\n\nNew drivers and businesses will likely find solace in the small, cosseting, electric arms of the BEV, too. Indeed, Toyota\u2019s plan is for this BEV to spearhead a plan that\u2019ll look at every aspect of a battery\u2019s life \u2013 resale, recycling, encouraging local businesses, using it for urban and mountain communities and so on.\n\nThis particular BEV will launch like this in Japan late next year, followed by a trio of \u2018Walking Area BEV\u2019 cars \u2013 one standing, one seated, and one for wheelchairs \u2013 in 2021.\n\nProbably worth keeping an eye on this whole \u2018electric\u2019 thing. Looks like it might catch on.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.topgear.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_1280w/public/images/news-article/2019/10/a26f51af29016f6ef882c757d398310e/ultra-compact-bev_copy.jpg?itok=qMHCpsGo", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
