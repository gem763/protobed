But when it comes to China \u2014 in particular to Hong Kong or to mass detentions of Muslims in Xinjiang \u2014 they\u2019re silent.\n\nWhat's happening: An image that Houston Rockets' general manager, Daryl Morey, tweeted \u2014 then quickly deleted \u2014 which backed Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests kicked off a firestorm in China.\n\nBoth Morey and the NBA have apologized for offending Chinese fans, but the Chinese government, the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) and multiple Chinese businesses have severed ties with the Rockets, reports Axios' Kendall Baker.\n\nHanging in the balance is a NBA-Tencent streaming deal worth billions, the support of millions of Chinese fans, and Morey's job.\n\nThis isn't the first time Beijing has squeezed an apology out of \u2014 or even changed the behavior of \u2014 an American entity. \"When it has to do with market access in China and profits ... they will bend over backwards to apologize,\" says Bonnie Glaser, an expert on China at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nMarriott apologized to China after Beijing shut down the hotel chain's website because it listed Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet and Macau as separate countries. \"We don\u2019t support separatist groups that subvert the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nAll three big U.S. airlines \u2014 American, United and Delta \u2014 bent to China's will last summer and scrubbed references to Taiwan as its own country.\n\nThe Gap \u2014 under threat of getting cut out of China \u2014 apologized for selling T-shirts with a map of China that didn't include Tibet or Taiwan. The company said its map was \"incorrect.\"\n\nBeijing, which is Hollywood's biggest international market, has also pushed American studios to alter content in order to get into Chinese theaters.\n\nThe bottom line: Leveraging foreign access to its 1.5 billion consumers is one of China\u2019s most potent weapons against the U.S.", "description": "Smart, efficient news worthy of your time, attention, and trust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
