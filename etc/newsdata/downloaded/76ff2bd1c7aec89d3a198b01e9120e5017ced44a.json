On an early June morning in 2015, some 51 months before you learned his name, Eddy Pi\u00f1eiro ducked into the passenger seat of a rented Chevy Impala and buckled up. His father slid in behind the wheel. A friend accompanied them. And for 12-plus hours, they cruised, first up the Atlantic coast. They swung inland, on highways lined with greenery, weaving between lakes. They passed Orlando, and Gainesville, and Tallahassee, cutting across the panhandle and into a different world. Their destination was Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and in the morning a camp. But for now, there was no dorm or hotel address to punch into smartphones.\n\nNo, the night before the kicks that would make or break his football career \u2013 that would make or break his and his family\u2019s life \u2013 Eddy Pi\u00f1eiro shut his eyes in a parking lot.\n\nNot on concrete, but in the Impala, with darkness as his comforter and the carseat his bed. \u201cTrying,\u201d as he says now, \u201cto friggin\u2019 get some good sleep.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe memory, still vivid, overwhelmed Pi\u00f1eiro on Sunday night, sometime after he swung his rocket launcher of a right leg and pummeled a football 60-plus yards through Mile High air. Sometime after his Bears teammates pranced onto the field and mobbed him. Sometime after Chicagoans toasted him, recollections of that 2015 evening brought tears to his eyes.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause a week before it, before he wowed Nick Saban, before SEC bluebloods offered him a future, Pi\u00f1eiro didn\u2019t know what his future held. He sat in a high school classroom in Coral Springs, Florida, about an hour north of home. He was a 19-year-old JUCO soccer player, the Miami-born son of Cuban and Nicaraguan immigrants, who\u2019d never kicked a field goal in a game. And he was tempted to shun football before it ever really gave him a shot.\n\nEddy Pineiro kicks the game winning field goal with one second left during the fourth quarter of the game on on Sunday. The Bears won the game 16 to 14. (Getty Images)\n\nF\u00fatbol or football?\n\nPi\u00f1eiro has, for some time now, been a cult hero, ever since he enrolled at the University of Florida for spring semester in 2016. Viral videos of 73-yarders endeared diehards. \u201cED-DY, ED-DY,\u201d Gator fans used to chant. Last month during training camp, before he\u2019d even attempted a regular-season NFL kick, Chicagoans adopted the chorus.\n\nThen, on Sunday, Pi\u00f1eiro\u2019s 53-yard game-winner in Denver vanquished double-doink demons, and the \u201ccult hero\u201d tag shed its modifier.\n\nThree days later, on a picturesque autumn morning in ultra-suburban Chicago, the newly minted NFC special teams player of the week sat at his Bears locker. Chris Brown\u2019s \u201cYo\u201d filled the room. Notebook- and camera-wielding reporters circled. And when the music quieted, they swarmed.\n\n\u201cWe can just do it with the music on,\u201d Pi\u00f1eiro joked.\n\nAnd then he spoke, for nearly 20 minutes, with energy and his customary Latin twang. A pair of stud earrings gleamed either side of his thick eyebrows and clean-shaven face. A smile came readily. And so did an answer to the first real question thrown at him.\n\n\u201cMy biggest congratulations?\u201d he pondered, mentally scrolling through the hundreds of messages he\u2019s received since Sunday.\n\n\u201cProbably from my dad.\u201d\n\nHis dad, Eddy Sr., was a Marielito. He was born in Cuba in the early 1970s, as Fidel Castro ramped up efforts to suppress dissent. In 1980, aged 9, he and his family fled, via boat from Mariel Harbor, to the United States.\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free on the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nMore than a decade later, he married and had Eddy Jr. The family eventually swelled to five. He had a short stint as a professional soccer player. Then, to support his wife and three kids, he turned to blue-collar labor. He now toils as a construction worker, installing kitchens. He made enough to keep the family afloat. But \u201cfinancially,\u201d Eddy Jr. says, \u201cthey\u2019ve never been stable in their life.\u201d\n\nSport, therefore, became Junior\u2019s route to college. And sport, throughout his childhood, meant f\u00fatbol. His goal growing up? \u201cI gotta be better than my dad,\u201d Pi\u00f1eiro says with a grin.\n\nFor a while, that seemed realistic. He was a multi-time All-Dade County selection in high school, and the Miami Herald\u2019s 2014 player of the year. There are stories, passed down in writing and by word of mouth, of goals from midfield; of late winners; of shirtless celebrations. Pi\u00f1eiro was a forward with flair, and with enough ability to earn a full ride to Florida Atlantic. Only then did fate intervene.\n\nThe NCAA ruled him academically ineligible. Pi\u00f1eiro scrambled for a Plan B. He chose ASA, a local junior college. Before long, he was wearing No. 10 and banging in goals. His education depended on it.\n\nOn the side, however, he had taken up kicking. He\u2019d arise at 5 a.m. to train with dad. Or he\u2019d work out with a friend, Santiago Arango, a fellow futbolista-turned-footballer who\u2019d come to the U.S. from Colombia at age 14. Arango introduced Pi\u00f1eiro to Brandon Kornblue, a kicking coach who\u2019d refine his technique.\n\nTo begin, in February, that technique was nonexistent. \u201cOut of like 20 field goals,\u201d Arango remembers, \u201che might make 10.\u201d Kornblue\u2019s estimate is 30 percent. \u201cHe was all over the place,\u201d the coach recalls.\n\nBy April, he\u2019d belted an 86-yard kickoff at Kornblue\u2019s camp. He\u2019d pinged the crossbar from 71. To those who were aware, he was a burgeoning phenom.\n\nIn between, however, Pi\u00f1eiro and Arango would retreat to Pi\u00f1eiro\u2019s home and fire up a computer. They\u2019d email Division I coaches across America, or tweet at them, pleading for a chance. \u201cAnd no one would respond,\u201d Arango remembers.\n\nPi\u00f1eiro had improved. Immensely. But without the financial means to travel to showcases, to force college programs to notice, validation eluded him. Hope wavered.\n\nFinally, in late May, Chris Sailer, one of the nation\u2019s elite kicking coaches, trekked to South Florida. Pi\u00f1eiro secured a camp invite. Two days of moonshots later, the curriculum brought guru and raw talent to that Coral Springs classroom for an evaluation. Sailer sat behind an old-school teacher\u2019s desk. Pi\u00f1eiro sat across from him.\n\n\u201cI call his dad in,\u201d Sailer says, picking up the story. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Chris, I need to know the honest truth. ... We\u2019re at a crossroads here. What do you think? Should my son kick? Because after this camp, we\u2019re making a decision. You either quit football completely and focus on soccer, or\u2019 \u2014\n\n\u201cAnd I go, \u2018Listen, Mr. Pi\u00f1eiro, trust me.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe following weekend, there was a high-profile camp in Tuscaloosa. Two-dozen Division I prospects. Saban. Opportunity.\n\n\u201cGet him down to Alabama,\u201d Sailer concluded.\n\n\u201cYou have an NFL leg right now,\u201d Arango remembers Sailer saying.\n\nAre you sure? Pi\u00f1eiro Sr. responded. It costs a lot of money. We don\u2019t have money.\n\n\u201cMr. Pi\u00f1eiro,\u201d Sailer assured. \u201cYes. Take him. Go.\u201d\n\nEddy Pineiro (15) sits on the shoulders of his Florida teammates as they celebrate after defeating South Carolina in 2016. (AP)\n\nThe trip that changed everything\n\nSo, with borrowed money, they rented a car that would double as lodging. Father made the stakes very clear. Son concurred. \u201cIf I don\u2019t get a scholarship here, I told him I was done,\u201d Pi\u00f1eiro Jr. remembers. He still loved soccer. Saturday morning, after a night in the Impala, stiff neck and all, would be his \u201cone shot.\u201d\n\nInstead, it became big-time college football\u2019s introduction to the legend of Eddy Pi\u00f1eiro. To the leg former Florida coach Jim McElwain would later compare to a golf club. To the unshakeable confidence, and the incorruptible swagger.\n\nAfter impressing Saban and schmoozing with him, the Pi\u00f1eiros and Arango returned to the road, whizzing through the night back south. Junior slept while senior drove. The following morning in Gainesville, his body doubly drained, a few kicks were enough to earn a scholarship offer from Florida.\n\n\u2018Bama, Miami and Georgia soon followed. Pi\u00f1eiro chose the Crimson Tide. Then came more viral videos, and more attention, which he soaked up. Then a sophomore soccer season, and an Alabama decommitment, and a Florida pledge.\n\nThe rest, as they say, is history. The kicks, but also the charm. The 52-yarder in his first spring game, but also the subsequent dab. The near-perfect junior season, but also the Mannequin Challenge handshake. \u201cWe would plan some out,\u201d long-snapper Ryan Farr says of Pi\u00f1eiro\u2019s celebrations. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see the majority of \u2018em. There were some we definitely would\u2019ve gotten a flag for.\u201d\n\nHaving drilled his final 16 kicks of 2017, Pi\u00f1eiro agonized over his NFL draft decision and then made it, electing to forgo his senior season and turn pro. After hearing 256 names called, none of which were his, he questioned himself. \u201cThat was probably the most disappointed I\u2019ve ever heard him,\u201d says Kornblue, who spoke with his former pupil that night. \u201cDamn,\u201d Pi\u00f1eiro thought, reconsidering his early entry. \u201cMaybe it was a mistake.\u201d\n\nHe latched on in Oakland. After appearing to have the Raiders job won as a rookie, a minor injury led to a \u201credshirt year\u201d and a dream put on hold. This past spring, he was dealt to Chicago, and thrust into the most scrutinized kicking competition in the league.\n\nBut the manufactured pressure? The \u201cAugusta silence\u201d? The inescapable cloud of Cody Parkey\u2019s miss that loomed over his and his challengers\u2019 every move?\n\nArango used to tell him: \u201cBro, you\u2019re the perfect kicker. Like, you don\u2019t think of the pressure at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey say pressure\u2019s on kickers,\u201d Pi\u00f1eiro once said, perhaps explaining his immunity to it. \u201cYou want to know pressure? Pressure is my dad going to work every single day, and he\u2019s the only one that brings money into my house. That\u2019s pressure.\u201d\n\nEddy Pineiro celebrates after kicking a fourth quarter game-winning field goal against the Denver Broncos at Empower Field at Mile High on September 15. (Getty Images)\n\nIn the spotlight\n\nBack inside Halas Hall at Bears headquarters, the man of the hour stands below a nameplate that\u2019s no longer accurate. Eddy Pi\u00f1eiro? Nah, try \u201cEddy Dinero,\u201d or \u201cEddy Money.\u201d Two iterations of the same new nickname. Two emblems of his newfound fame.\n\nWhether he\u2019s changed or not, his life has. He\u2019s met the mayor. He\u2019s stocked up on free Snickers. He became the main attraction at Halas, the Bears PR staff struggling to pick up the blitz of requests that filled their inboxes. After 15 nonstop minutes with reporters, Pi\u00f1eiro let out a sharp, stress-breaking \u201cWhoo!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is so many questions,\u201d he said laughing. \u201cHow much time we got here?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a refreshing duality to his personality, a chill Latino vibe that operates concurrently with a more private determination. There are the trick shots, and the 81-yarders for cameras; but also an unseen work ethic, and a deep commitment to his faith. With adrenaline still pumping after his game-winner Sunday, he told Fox\u2019s national audience: \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe in Jesus Christ, you better start, because He\u2019s real!\u201d\n\nYet amid the same pandemonium, there was a youthful exuberance, and a spontaneity. Oh, and if it were a soccer jersey draped over his shoulders rather than a football one?\n\n\u201cMy shirt would\u2019ve definitely been off, and I would\u2019ve waved it and slid on my knees,\u201d he says, beaming. \u201cOne hundred percent.\u201d\n\nMost of all, though, there is also a deep familial love, bred and still based in South Florida, unaltered by the shallower love now flooding in from elsewhere. There\u2019s a desire to help those who\u2019ve helped him. And the kid who used to do so by installing kitchen cabinets with dad can now use game checks.\n\n\u201cI want to be a great kicker so I can support my family for the rest of my life,\u201d Pi\u00f1eiro says. \u201cSo they never have to work a day in their life. That\u2019s been my goal since Day 1.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve struggled so much, and they\u2019ve given me everything. And now it\u2019s time that I give them everything.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nHenry Bushnell is a features writer for Yahoo Sports.
