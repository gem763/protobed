He was accompanied by the US homeland security department\u2019s acting deputy secretary, David Pekoske.\n\nThe meeting was formally about the risks and opportunities of new technologies but Barr also raised his inquiries into the FBI investigation.\n\nNew reports reveal wider role for Barr and Pompeo in impeachment scandal Read more\n\nA Whitehall official said the issue of UK cooperation was discussed informally and only on the margins of the meeting. US officials have said Barr\u2019s role is confined to ensuring that the official inquiry team members are introduced to the right people.\n\nIt has been reported that Barr is pressing a range of foreign powers to cooperate with his effort to piece together the origins of the FBI investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s links with Russia.\n\nBarr\u2019s critics claim he is seeking to discredit the FBI investigation by constructing a vast conspiracy theory that foreign powers were working to secure Hillary Clinton\u2019s election in 2016.\n\nThe inquiry by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, showed that Russia was attempting to swing the presidential election in favour of Trump.\n\nBarr\u2019s counter-attack has been given an added urgency as Trump seeks to find a way to block potential impeachment hearings. The president is facing claims he threatened to withdraw military aid from Ukraine unless it cooperated with his efforts to find dirt on the former US vice-president Joe Biden, a potential challenger in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nQ&A What is the Trump-Ukraine whistleblower scandal? Show Hide On 25 July, US president Donald Trump called Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. During the course of the call he reportedly asked the Ukrainian leader eight times to investigate former US vice-president Joe Biden and Biden\u2019s son Hunter. It is additionally reported that Trump ordered his staff to withhold nearly $400m in aid to Ukraine days before the call took place. Biden is one of the frontrunners to win the Democratic nomination and take on Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Trump confirmed he discussed the Bidens with Zelenskiy, and accused the pair \u2013 without offering any evidence \u2013 of corruption. A US intelligence community whistleblower filed a report after becoming alarmed at Trump\u2019s behaviour in the matter. The White House refused to release the substance of the whistleblower complaint, setting up a confrontation with Congress over the release of information. Complaints of this nature are usually reported to Congress within seven days. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, has admitted asking the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens. It is illegal for a political campaign to accept a \u201cthing of value\u201d from a foreign government. Democrats say an investigation into a political opponent \u2013 for which Trump appears to have been pushing \u2013 would amount to a thing of value.\n\nMike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, began a brief visit to Italy on Tuesday, days after Barr had been in Rome seeking details of what cooperation the Italians may have given to the FBI inquiry.\n\nIt was reported on Monday that Pompeo had taken part in Trump\u2019s controversial call to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Pompeo also wrote to the House foreign affairs committee rejecting demands from House Democrats for five current and former state department officials to testify before committees investigating the Ukraine scandal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mike Pompeo with Giuseppe Conte in Rome on Tuesday.

The president has said: \u201cIt\u2019s the greatest hoax, probably, in the history of our country and somebody has to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s administration has mounted two investigations into whether overseas agencies played a role in investigating his 2016 campaign. The first inquiry, led by the justice department inspector general, Michael Horowitz \u2013 now completed but unpublished \u2013 focussed narrowly on the background to the granting of a surveillance warrant in 2016 on the Trump campaign member Carter Page.\n\nThe second review, set up by Barr in May and led by the US attorney John Durham, is looking at the origins of the Russia investigation, including whether there was bias against the Trump administration among senior officials in the security services.\n\nUnlike Horowitz\u2019s review, Durham\u2019s has the power to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside the government. The degree to which overseas intelligence agencies are dutybound to cooperate with the inquiry is unclear.\n\nOne UK government source said: \u201cThe intelligence relationship is so close that there is no need to pressurise the UK to cooperate.\u201d\n\nThe Australian government has disclosed that it agreed formally in writing to cooperate, and it is known the former MI6 officer Christopher Steele cooperated extensively with Horowitz. He agreed to be interviewed by US justice department officials in London over his role in preparing a dossier on collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. His evidence was in effect given under oath.\n\nDurham has not been in touch with Steele, it is understood.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The former MI6 agent Christopher Steele. Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA\n\nBy coincidence, he was interviewed in the week that Trump conducted a state visit to the UK in June. Steele, through his lawyers, had been reluctant to be cross-examined, but was told the UK intelligence services had no objections. The interview focused on Steele\u2019s knowledge of Russian interference efforts globally, his intelligence collection methods and his findings about Page, whom the FBI ultimately surveilled.\n\nSteele had previously met a two-person FBI team from the office of Mueller, whose report on Russian interference in the 2016 election was published in April.\n\nAround the same time as the most recent Steele interview, it was known that Trump was threatening to end the historically close cooperation between the British and the US intelligence services. That threat, first made in public by Pompeo in February, was linked to a US warning that it could not cooperate with an intelligence agency that allowed the Chinese-owned telecoms company Huawei access to UK 5G networks.\n\nAustralian government agreed to help Donald Trump investigate Mueller inquiry origins Read more\n\nTrump withdrew the threat at a press conference with Theresa May after he met her and the then foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, privately to discuss the issue, despite there being no apparent change of position from the UK on Huawei. The president would have known by then that Steele was cooperating with his justice department inquiry.\n\nAsked if Washington was ready to \u201cimpose limits on intelligence sharing\u201d, the US president replied: \u201cNo, because we are going to have absolutely an agreement on Huawei and everything else. We have an incredible intelligence relationship and we will be able to work out any differences.\u201d\n\nBarr\u2019s visit to Italy largely stemmed from claims by the former Trump aide George Papadopoulos that Italy holds the key to identifying the source of alleged smears against Trump in 2016.\n\nPapadopoulos, briefly a member of the advisory committee for foreign policy in the Trump election campaign, told the then Australian high commissioner to the UK, Alexander Downer, in 2016 that Russia possessed emails hacked from Democratic party servers that were damaging to Clinton. Papadopoulos later claimed he was set up.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest George Papadopoulos outside court last September. Photograph: Yuri Gripas/Reuters\n\nDowner passed the information to the FBI, helping prompt the investigation led by Mueller.\n\nSpeaking to Australian radio, Downer refused to add to previous comments about his meeting with Papadopoulos. \u201cI\u2019ve just got nothing more to say about it,\u201d he told ABC Radio National. \u201cI mean, I had a conversation with this guy, I passed on the conversation or that one element of the conversation to the Americans and there\u2019s just nothing more to it. I can\u2019t offer you any more information.\u201d\n\nPapadopoulos has served a jail sentence for lying to the FBI about claims a Maltese academic, Joseph Mifsud, was the source of his information on Russia. He has said without evidence that Mifsud is an agent of the Italian secret service, and sought to entrap him. Mifsud has been missing for two years.\n\nPapadopoulos had made a series of allegations about Downer\u2019s motives. However, Downer is a conservative, a supporter of Brexit, and not seen as a man to try to deliberately undermine Trump for political purposes.\n\nThe UK Foreign Office said in a statement: \u201cInvestigations in the US are a matter for the US authorities. We won\u2019t comment on the ongoing investigations.\u201d", "description": "US attorney general raised review of Trump-Russia inquiry at meeting in London, say sources", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour", "Luke Harding", "Jonathan Freedland"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c820a5e7b25b31c861312b609b1490e24ac1acfa/0_222_2767_1660/master/2767.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=982cfc8b5b219319943ad805b1763feb", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
