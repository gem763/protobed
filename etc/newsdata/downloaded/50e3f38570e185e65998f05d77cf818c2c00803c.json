Say NO to bigotry and hatred on your High Street.\u201d\n\nThe whole UK Pride Organisers Network have a clear message to @ChickfilA and that is \u201cYou are not welcome anywhere in the UK and we will stand up, like we did today quite rightly telling you to Cluck Off if we see you again\u201d #GetTheChickOut @Reading_Pride we all stand with you! pic.twitter.com/FOq6e1oGmU \u2014 UK Pride Network (@UKPrideNetwork) October 19, 2019\n\nChick-fil-A said in a statement sent to The New York Times and The Washington Post that the company had planned to keep the Reading location open only for a limited time.\n\n\u201cWe have been very pleased with the lines since opening Oct. 10 and are grateful for customer response to our food and our approach to customer service,\u201d the company said in the statement on Saturday. \u201cWe mutually agreed to a six-month lease with the Oracle Mall in Reading as part of a longer term strategy for us as we look to expand our international presence.\u201d\n\nChick-fil-A added that it was \u201calways looking and learning, and do so through pop-up locations,\u201d but had no plans to share.\n\nChick-fil-A has taken heat over its acknowledged financial support of anti-LGBTQ organizations for years. At one point, recipients of the chain\u2019s contributions reportedly included Exodus International and the Family Research Council.\n\nThe company\u2019s billionaire CEO, Dan Cathy, stoked outrage when asked about those donations in 2012, acknowledging his franchise\u2019s \u201csupport of the traditional family\u201d in an interview.\n\nSince then, Chick-fil-A has made repeated attempts to stem the backlash by pledging not to \u201chave a political or social agenda.\u201d\n\nHowever, the fast food chain\u2019s 2017 tax documents \u2015 obtained by ThinkProgress in March \u2015 found that the company had donated $9.9 million to charity, of which roughly $1.8 million went to groups known to discriminate against LGBTQ people.\n\nRodney Bullard, leader of the Chick-fil-A Foundation, dismissed the criticism in a Business Insider interview published in May, saying the company\u2019s donations were aimed at serving low-income and underprivileged children and \u201crelevant and impactful to the community.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor us, that\u2019s a much higher calling than any political or cultural war that\u2019s being waged,\u201d said Bullard, the company\u2019s vice president of corporate social responsibility and the executive director of the company\u2019s charitable foundation. \u201cThis is really about an authentic problem that is on the ground, that is present and ever present in the lives of many children who can\u2019t help themselves.\u201d", "description": "The Oracle, a British shopping center, announced last week it would not extend the fast food chain's six-month lease.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dadacee200000d2195064a5.jpeg?cache=ww6tlqb16j&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
