Titled \"10,000 Hours,\" the ballad is dedicated to the artists' wives who all appear in the music video for the track. (Bieber and wife Hailey Baldwin held a private ceremony on Sept. 30 to celebrate their nuptials a year after they legally wedded.)\n\n\"10,000 Hours\" has now skyrocketed to the top of the country charts and this week, it will jump from No. 40 to No. 1 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs.\n\nThis will mark Bieber's first appearance atop the Hot Country songs chart, making this the seventh chart he's dominated. Previously, Bieber has topped the following Billboard charts: Hot Dance/Electronic Songs, Hot Latin Songs, Hot R&B Songs, Hot Rap Songs, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and the Hot 100. Bieber is now the only artist to ever reach N. 1 in all seven of these categories.\n\nClose followers of Bieber's social media accounts have noticed lately that the pop star is teasing more new music and perhaps even a full album on its way before the year's end. Last week, he shared clips of himself in the studio, \"messing around\" and performing rap verses.", "description": "His latest collaboration with Dan + Shay has secured him a top spot on the country charts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5321032.1571147604!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/justin-bieber-dan-shay.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
