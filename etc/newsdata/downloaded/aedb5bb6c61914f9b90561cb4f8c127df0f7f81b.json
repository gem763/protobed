The Journal's report said that a Saudi official indicated that the U.S. intelligence was not definitive. The official told the paper that the U.S. did not provide enough evidence to prove without a doubt that Tehran\u2019s hand was involved.\n\nPresident Trump has said the U.S. is \u201clocked and loaded\u201d and able to respond to the threat but also said he wants to avoid war. Iran has denied any involvement in the attack.
