After breaking out of a month-long consolidation on September 5, a new trading range has been forming in the 2960 to 3020 area which is just below the highs that were hit in late July. It is a good setup for a breakout move over 3025.\n\nWhile the overall technical picture looks quite favorable, the action under the surface has not been easy. What has been most notable about the action lately is that there has been a minimal reaction to major news events. The much-anticipated Fed interest rate cut last week produced some brief upside but it was given back on Friday.\n\nWhat continues to drive the market more than anything else are the frequent headlines about China trade. On Friday the indices sold off following news that a Chinese delegation had canceled plans to visit some farms in Montana. That doesn't sound like a major event but the computer algorithms are hyper-sensitive to any Chinese news since nothing else seems to be driving the indices very much.\n\nThere are no major news events scheduled for this week but there is very likely to be more speculation about progress on a China deal to create some movement. The negotiations are set to resume in early October so nothing concrete is likely to occur this week but there will be plenty of talk about the potential for progress.\n\nWithout any major news events on the agenda, seasonality will likely play a more important role in the action. According to Quantifiable Edges, the week after option expiration in September has historically been the worst week of the year. Since 1990 the S&P 500 has been lower at some point during the week following September option expiration every year except for 2001 and 2017.\n\nSeasonality is a tendency and not a certainty so it is a mistake to place too much weight on this information but it does suggest that finding good trades may be more challenging than usual.\n\nThe biggest difficulty recently has been finding solid technical setups. There have been some trading on news in sectors like solar energy and oil but if you are a position trader looking for entry points it has been particularly challenging lately. The rotation out of high momentum stocks and into value names that took place recently has reversed to some degree but it hasn't helped to create very attractive chart patterns.\n\nI'm starting the week with a high level of cash, some small index shorts and not much of interest on my radar. I'll be digging for some new inventory.\n\nI suspect that the mood is negative enough to help provide some underlying support but that upside momentum will be very difficult.\n\nWe have a slightly negative start shaping up and some bounce in precious metals.", "description": "While the overall technical picture looks quite favorable, the action under the surface has not been easy.", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "Negative Seasonality Makes A Challenging Market Even More Challenging", "While The Overall Technical Picture Looks Quite Favorable", "The Action Under The Surface Has Not Been Easy.", "Bob Lang", "Timothy Collins", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Jonathan Heller", "Bruce Kamich"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/11cf87e9-9e13-11e7-98b5-3547c43d6786.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
