It raises the possibility that traffickers were given nearly \u00a31.2million in total by the 39 victims.\n\nFour people have now been arrested in connection with the deaths including married pair Joanna and Thomas Maher, both 38, of Warrington, Cheshire.\n\nPolice at first thought the victims were all Chinese but at least six Vietnamese families fear their loved ones are among the dead.\n\nThe brother of a 19-year-old woman from Vietnam said she called him on Tuesday morning, saying she was getting into a container and was turning off her phone to avoid detection. He has not heard from her since.\n\nWhile the family of Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20, said he travelled from Vietnam to France over a year ago and has not been heard from in recent days.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: Press Association Images)\n\nPolice are still questioning Joanna and Thomas Maher on suspicion of people trafficking and 39 counts of manslaughter.\n\nHours earlier they told the Mirror they previously owned the Scania lorry cab driven by Mo Robinson, 25, of Laurelvale, Northern Ireland, who was arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of murder after the victims were found dead in the container in Grays, Essex.\n\nThe Mahers said they sold the Bulgarian-registered vehicle a year ago to a company in Ireland.\n\nOutside their \u00a3250,000 home, Mr Maher, who is understood to be a haulage firm owner said: \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting what\u2019s happened.\u201d\n\nHe added he contacted police after news of the deaths broke. It is mum-of-three Mrs Maher is a hairdresser.\n\nIn Bulgaria, Ivan Jelyazkov said he had helped set up a company that owned the truck and added the Mahers are \u201chonest people\u201d.\n\nAs the Mahers were being questioned, police revealed on Friday they had detained a fourth person.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n(Image: Peter Powell)\n\nThe 48-year-old man, from Northern Ireland, was arrested at Stansted Airport in Essex on suspicion of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people.\n\nPolice added: \u201cA 25-year-old man arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of murder remains in custody.\u201d\n\nIt is believed most, if not all, the victims were dead when Robinson picked up the container at Purfleet on the River Thames at 1.05am. He drove the short distance to the Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, where the horrific discovery was made.\n\nThe container is believed to have travelled on freight ship MV Clementine, which sailed from Zeebrugge, Belgium at 3pm on Tuesday.\n\nIt docked shortly after midnight at Purfleet and Robinson picked up the trailer 35 minutes later.\n\nThe container is owned by Irish firm Global Trailer Rentals Ltd and was leased on October 15 from its yard in Co Monaghan at \u00a3250 per week until its return.\n\nIts GPS data has been analysed and a source said: \u201cThe migrants may have come from China but the data on the GPS suggests the container didn\u2019t journey past Western Europe.\u201d\n\nThe Mirror understands data shows the container arrived in Holyhead on Anglesey overnight on October 16 before crossing to mainland Europe that evening.\n\nThe trailer travelled to Dunkirk and Lille in France, and Bruges in Belgium. The trailer then made two journeys between the UK and mainland Europe between October 17 and 22.\n\nOfficials in Zeebrugge yesterday admitted only 1% of sealed containers leaving the port for journeys in Europe are X-rayed in custom spot-checks.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIn addition, refrigerated lorries cannot be searched with CO2 probes or sniffer dogs. Peter Degroote, one of the Zeebrugge harbour masters, said security measure meant it is virtually impossible for the 39 migrants to have boarded the lorry at the port.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe scan with X-rays but that\u2019s not to find people. They are to check the goods.\u201d\n\nChief executive Joachim Coens said they and terminal operator C.RO Ports do \u201ceverything possible\u201d to stop people from entering the terminal. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s wired, it\u2019s fenced, it\u2019s locked.\u201d\n\nThe first postmortems on the 39 victims began on Friday.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE Four people have been arrested in connection with the deaths of 39 migrants who were found dead in a refrigeration container in Grays, Essex", "authors": ["Paul Byrne", "Mick Mcniffe", "Nick Sommerlad", "Tom Pettifor", "Amy-Clare Martin", "Image", "Pa", "Twitter", "Bbc", "Press Association Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20712678.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bodies-found-in-lorry-container.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
