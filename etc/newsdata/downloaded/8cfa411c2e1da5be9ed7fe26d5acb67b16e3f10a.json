She applauded Geeta for being a successful single mother-of-two\n\nThe mother-of-three from Lambeth treated her family to a day-trip to Brighton to see the sea and have some fun on the pier\n\nLeaving the Lambeth flat for an evening was also a challenge for the women, who admitted they were nervous about going on a night out in Andrea's neighbourhood.\n\n'I really think the next few days are gonna be hard,' she told pal Harriet.\n\nBut when the two women travelled to Brixton for the first time ever, they were amazed by the 'vibrant' atmosphere and added it felt very 'safe.'\n\nMeanwhile, Andrea focused on how she could turn her financial life around while enjoying Geeta's luxury lifestyle,\n\nThe mother-of-three used some of her expanded budget to buy herself a computer in order to study for her teacher training.\n\nAt the end of the episode, the three women from different world met. Geeta and Harriet used the remaining money of their budget to pay for boxing lessons for Andrea's daughter Shanice (pictured in the pink top)\n\n'This is money well-spent,' she told the camera. This is my future, here, so good on us.'\n\nShe applauded Geeta for creating and caring for her business while being a single mother, and said she was 'motivated' by it.\n\nShe also took her girls to Brighton for a day trip, and paid for drama lessons for her eldest daughter Shanice, who wants to be an actress.\n\nAt the end of the episode, the three women met and Geeta and Harriet used the remaining money from their budget to pay for boxing lessons for Andrea's daughter Shanice.\n\nAfter the show Harriet took to Twitter to address viewers' comments, saying: 'What didn\u2019t make the cut tonight was that both Geeta and I have turned our lives around from massive lows.\n\n'We have both experienced poverty, hardship, fear and having to dig deep to turn things around. We\u2019ve worked v hard to get where we are now.'", "description": "Business woman Geeta Sidhu Robb and her pal Harriet swapped houses with a Lambeth-based mother-of-three on benefits on Channel 5's Rich House, Poor House last night.", "authors": ["Claire Toureille For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/10/19877386-0-image-a-9_1571391556372.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
