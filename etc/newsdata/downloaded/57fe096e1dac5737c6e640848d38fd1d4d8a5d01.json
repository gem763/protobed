The mishap occurred after the star invited a fan on stage with her, according to Entertainment Tonight.\n\nVideo from an audience member shows a man holding Gaga on stage, jumping up and down with her in his arms. Gaga's legs were wrapped around the fan, so when he fell, she took the tumble with him.\n\nLady Gaga had an unfortunate fall off the stage tonight at Enigma after a fan picked her up and tripped. Gaga crashed down first with the fan falling on top of her. She got right back up and continued the show.

People immediately swarmed Gaga and the fan, helping them off the ground.\n\nThe singer did not appear seriously injured by the incident. Another video taken by an audience member shows her performing \"Bad Romance\" shortly after the fall. \"The level of professionalism... far too much!\" the fan wrote.\n\nWhile the show went on, Gaga did ice her entire body after the concert \u2013 something that she called her \"post show routine.\" She shared three photos of the ritual: \"ice bath for 5-10 min, hot bath for 20, then compression suit packed with ice packs for 20.\"\n\nShe also shared her \"pre-show\" routine: swimming laps in a pool. On Instagram, she dubbed herself \"Gaga Phelps.\"\n\nThe Oscar-nominated actress has been known to deal with fibromyalgia, a condition that causes chronic pain. She has tried several treatments to ease the soreness in the past, as seen in her documentary, \"Lady Gaga: Five Foot Two.\"\n\nThe cause of fibromyalgia is unknown, but doctors have identified a number of risk factors, which usually occur during middle age. Ahead of the documentary's 2017 release, Gaga said she wished to \"raise awareness & connect people who have it.\"\n\nEntertainment Tonight has reached out to Gaga's representatives and Park MGM for comment. There is no official word on whether or not she sustained any significant injuries during her fall.", "description": "The mishap occurred after the star invited a fan on stage with her", "authors": ["Caitlin O'Kane"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/18/db04f5fe-2471-4d98-86ad-a90cd34b7f2f/thumbnail/1200x630/a06ac892ffe3cbe63a32c050312ae88d/untitled-collage-26.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
