A spokeswoman for Mayor Jorge Elorza said the statue will be cleaned Monday.\n\nA Columbus statue in the Southern California city of Chula Vista was also defaced Monday with red paint. A Chula Vista police officer discovered the defaced Columbus statue in the city\u2019s Discovery Park.\n\nCrews were called in to clean off the paint, Chula Vista police Capt. Vern Sallee told the San Diego Union Tribune .\n\nThe statue was similarly vandalized in February.\n\nIn San Francisco, a Columbus statue at the foot of Coit Tower, in the city\u2019s North Beach neighborhood, was vandalized sometime Saturday night or Sunday morning. Someone poured red paint over it and drew anarchy symbols and messages on the concrete base that read \u201cDestroy all monuments of genocide\u201d and \u201cKill all colonizers.\u201d\n\nCity workers cleaned the statue Sunday as thousands celebrated Italian culture in North Beach, San Francisco\u2019s \u201cLittle Italy.\u201d\n\nThe New World explorer has become a polarizing figure.\n\nNative American advocates have pressed states to change Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day over concerns that Columbus spurred centuries of genocide against indigenous populations in the Americas.\n\nA handful of states celebrated their first Indigenous Peoples Day on Monday as part of a trend to move away from a day honoring Christopher Columbus.\n\nNew Mexico, Vermont and Maine are among the latest to pass measures doing away with Columbus Day celebrations in deference to Native Americans.\n\nIn all, around 10 states observe some version of Indigenous Peoples Day in October, along with more than 100 U.S. cities. Washington, D.C., is celebrating Indigenous Peoples Day this year under a temporary measure.\n\nThe federal Columbus Day holiday remains in place.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Several Christopher Columbus statues were vandalized with red paint and messages against the 15th century Italian navigator Monday when the U.S. holiday named for one of the first Europeans to reach the Americas was being celebrated.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/columbus_statue_vandalized_49948_c0-0-3872-2258_s1200x700.jpg?dcce664ededc6d5a7fb5e6d29d9e91880fe32127", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
