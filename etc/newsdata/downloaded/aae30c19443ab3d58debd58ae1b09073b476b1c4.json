Disney movies will be available for purchase on its Box Office pay-per-view service, and content from 21st Century Fox \u2212 which Disney bought for $US71.3 billion and which owns shows such as The Simpsons and Modern Family \u2212 will still be available on Foxtel. FX Networks content, such as The Walking Dead, will remain exclusive to Foxtel in Australia.\n\nFollowing the reshuffle in November, Foxtel's movie package will include Foxtel Movies in 4K, Movies Kids, Movies Family, Movies Drama, Movies Hits and Movies Masterpiece. Disney's move was first reported by industry publication TV Blackbox.\n\n\"We have a huge summer coming up and this is just the start of the exciting announcements we have in stall, including an amazing summer of cricket,\" Foxtel chief executive Patrick Delany said in a statement.\n\n\"The new channels across movies and entertainment add to our existing flagship channels and will be home to thousands of hours of the best live and on-demand TV all in one place. There is no other collection of channel brands like those Foxtel offers on Australian television or streaming platforms.\"\n\nDisney declined to comment on the move.\n\nIt comes as Disney's existing content deal with Stan also comes to an end. Stan is owned by Nine, publisher of The Australian Financial Review. Discussions about the future relationship between Disney and Nine are understood to be ongoing.\n\nThe Financial Review revealed in August the two companies were talking about commercial partnerships, including a potential bundle of Disney+ and Stan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisney is betting big on streaming globally and has progressively ended deals across the globe with third parties for its content. On Friday, The Wall Street Journal reported Disney had banned its television networks in the US from taking advertising from streaming giant Netflix a month out from the launch of Disney+.\n\nFoxtel is preparing to launch its own drama and entertainment streaming service and is in negotiations with key content providers, including NBCUniversal, Disney and Turner. It re-signed a deal with the BBC in August.\n\nStreaming is becoming an important part of Foxtel's business. Both Foxtel and News Corp, which owns 65 per cent of the pay TV business, have admitted customer growth will not come from its traditional broadcast business. While Foxtel's cable customers are high value, their numbers have been in decline and the business is trying to pivot to attract more streaming customers.\n\nIts streaming customer base grew to 776,000 as of June 30, including sports streaming service Kayo and Foxtel Now, which replicates the broadcast service via streaming.\n\nHowever, the launch of a new drama and entertainment streaming service will face stiff competition in a market which includes Netflix, Stan, Amazon, Ten All Access, and global players Disney and Apple to launch later in 2019.", "description": "From November 7, the Disney Movie channel will no longer be available on Foxtel, which includes movies from Disney Animation, Pixar, Marvel and most Lucasfilm productions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4751%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_94%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5adc9d25a5044c89f3fbe000d981b29f8514571c", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
