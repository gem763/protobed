I haven't seen the final season.\n\n\"But I know what it took to shoot it, and it was hard, and everyone put all of their love and effort into it,\" he continued. \"I think for us, we knew what we were doing was right, story-wise, and we knew that it was right for the characters, because we'd lived with them for 10 years. So the controversy, for us, didn't really affect us. But thank you for the question.\"\n\nKit Harington and Clarke embrace at the Netflix Primetime Emmy Awards After Party on Sunday.
