Taylor Jr., the senior U.S. diplomat to Ukraine. As Taylor explained to congressional investigators on Tuesday, one was the \u201cregular, formal\u201d channel, which included \u201cthe bulk of the U.S. effort to support Ukraine against the Russian invasion\u201d that has been a persistent threat for a half-decade.\n\nIt is the other, \u201cirregular, informal\u201d channel that is of interest to members of Congress.\n\nGuided by Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who is now a personal lawyer for President Trump, the irregular efforts described by Taylor were intended to force the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate Hunter Biden, son of Joe Biden.\n\nHunter Biden sat on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that has been accused of corrupt practices. He no longer has any ties to Burisma, but his father is running for president, and some of President Trump\u2019s allies see Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings as potentially damaging to the former vice president \u2014 and therefore helpful to Trump\u2019s chances of winning reelection next year.\n\nDemocrats, for their part, have opened an impeachment inquiry into efforts by Trump and Giuliani to exert pressure on Ukraine to launch an investigation into Biden.\n\nWilliam Taylor Jr., the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, arrives Tuesday to testify on Capitol Hill as part of the Democrats' impeachment investigation of President Trump.

Scott Applewhite/AP) More\n\nRight around the time that Taylor prepared to testify in a closed-door hearing room on Capitol Hill, Trump attempted to cast himself as the victim of a \u201clynching.\u201d But using the language of racist violence appeared to quickly backfire, with even some Republicans denouncing him. In one poignant rebuke, Michael Steele, the first and only African-American head of the Republican National Committee, tweeted the photo of a lynched black man hanging from a tree.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pathetic that you act like you\u2019re such a victim,\u201d Steele wrote. \u201cYou should know better.\u201d\n\nAs details of Taylor\u2019s testimony became public, it was clear that Trump\u2019s day was only going to get worse. In his opening statement, which was provided to the Washington Post, Taylor described ongoing efforts throughout the spring and summer of 2019 to withhold some $400 million in assistance from Ukraine \u2014 including $250 million in military aid \u2014 unless Ukraine launched an investigation into Burisma and the Bidens. Giuliani and others were also adherents of a conspiracy theory that elements within Ukraine interfered on Hillary Clinton\u2019s behalf in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIn his opening statement, Taylor described the \u201cconfusing and unusual arrangement\u201d he encountered when arriving in Kiev in the late spring of 2019, in which Giuliani and others \u201coperated mostly outside of official State Department channels.\u201d Taylor appeared to implicate the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, in the Giuliani-led push for a political investigation by the new Ukrainian government.\n\nFor example, on June 27, Sondland allegedly told Taylor that if Zelensky expected an Oval Office meeting, he \u201cneeded to make clear\u201d that he \u201cwas not standing in the way of \u2018investigations,\u2019\u201d according to Taylor\u2019s opening statement.\n\n\u201cBy mid-July,\u201d Taylor told congressional investigators, \u201cit was becoming clear to me that the meeting President Zelensky wanted was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.\u201d (The national security establishment believes that interference in the 2016 election was conducted by Russia, not Ukraine, and that it was on behalf of Trump, not Clinton.)", "description": "The top U.S. emissary to Ukraine painted a devastating portrait in testimony Tuesday on Capitol Hill of what appeared to be White House-directed efforts to pressure the government in Kiev to investigate a Democratic political rival.", "authors": ["Alexander Nazaryan", "National Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jFLZIH0v8R0jKLBYnw9_kQ--~B/aD0yNjY2O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/97037670-f50c-11e9-8f57-ef7ae7be63f0", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
