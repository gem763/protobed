Who the Fuck? (2004)\n\nA rare moment of levity in the Harvey oeuvre: all the mad-eyed, vengeful, shrieking fury of Rid of Me brought to bear upon a hairdresser who has made the mistake of messing up the singer\u2019s cut and blow dry: \u201cGet your comb out of there! You can\u2019t straighten my curls! Fuck you! Fuck you!\u201d\n\n49. Harder (1995)\n\nHarvey\u2019s B-sides can provide rich pickings: if you can understand why Harder didn\u2019t make the cut for To Bring You My Love \u2013 there\u2019s no getting around the fact that it\u2019s essentially a song about an erect penis \u2013 the sheer lascivious relish and the twisting guitar riff are irresistible.\n\n48. Water (1992)\n\nYou could hear the influence of US alt-rock on Dry, but its contents seemed to have a different kind of intensity to anything else around at the time, as shown by Water\u2019s mysterious depiction of a suicide that could be driven by love or by religious mania: gripping, punishing listening.\n\n47. Guilty (2016)\n\nRecorded for The Hope Six Demolition Project, but left off the album and subsequently released as a single, Guilty is far darker than the album that preceeded it: no mean feat, but with its barrage of percussion, discordant brass and synths and a lyric about drone strikes, it pulls it off with grim aplomb.\n\n46. The Crowded Cell (2019)\n\nHarvey has recently shifted into scoring films and plays. As the closing theme from Shane Meadows\u2019s TV drama The Virtues demonstrates, that hasn\u2019t occasioned any letup in the intensity of her work: bleak, repetitive and powerful, The Crowded Cell unflinchingly details a litany of physical and mental abuse.\n\n45. Is That All There Is? (1996)\n\nHarvey seldom records cover versions. Her fierce, Rid of Me-era take on Willie Dixon\u2019s Wang Dang Doodle is pretty spectacular, but the best of them may be this agonisingly slow, utterly disconsolate version of the Peggy Lee standard: breaking out the booze and having a ball never sounded such a miserable prospect.\n\n44. Taut (1996)\n\nHarvey\u2019s first collaboration with John Parish, Dance Hall at Louse Point, at its most strange and unpredictable: a gabbled, whispered vocal over a chaotic backing that occasionally resolves into something like an alt-rock chorus. Out-there, but bizarrely captivating.\n\n43. Easy (1993)\n\nA song that only appeared on the 4-Track Demos collection, Easy is as taut and livid as anything on Rid of Me: lyrics dealing with a topic that would later be called slut-shaming, scourging guitars, a rhythm track provided by Harvey barking.\n\n42. The Mess We\u2019re In (2000)\n\nThe Mess We\u2019re In is a fabulous song \u2013 beautifully muted, the music evokes dusk settling on a city \u2013 but even if it wasn\u2019t, it would make it on to this list by dint of requiring guest vocalist Thom Yorke to sing the line \u201cNight and day I dream of makin\u2019 love to you now, baby\u201d.\n\n41 Send His Love to Me (1995)\n\nNever big on lyrical explication, Harvey has always complained that people tend to project her personal life on to songs that she approaches like a short story writer, something evident from Send His Love to Me\u2019s saga of an abandoned wife going slowly nuts in her remote desert home.\n\n40. The Wind (1998)\n\nIs This Desire? at its most haunting. The music is muted, faintly trip-hoppy \u2013 syncopated funk drums, a relentless guitar loop, cinematic strings \u2013 but flecked with shards of disjointed noise. The vocal is part-whispered, the lyrics contemplate the torture and martyrdom of St Catherine: lowkey, but The Wind really gets under the listener\u2019s skin.\n\n39. We Float (2000)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only pop according to PJ Harvey,\u201d the singer said of Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea, \u201cwhich is probably as un-pop as you can get by most people\u2019s standards.\u201d We Float bears that out: its melody is lovely, but its weightless, six-minute drift walks an odd, intoxicating line between blissed-out and sinister.\n\n38. White Chalk (2007)\n\nA deeply creepy mystery movie in song, sung in a childlike voice that occasionally veers off-key and set to tumbling piano and banjo. In the Dorset countryside, something terrible has clearly happened to the narrator, a pregnant woman, but exactly what \u2013 murder? Suicide? \u2013 is never revealed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest PJ Harvey live in Rome, 2008. Photograph: Ernesto Ruscio/FilmMagic.com\n\n37. Meet Ze Monsta (1995)\n\nThere is a distinct playfulness about Meet Ze Monsta, the track on To Bring You My Love that most recalls its predecessor Rid of Me. Harvey sounds as if she is having a thoroughly good time inhabiting the song\u2019s menacing, darkly sexy protagonist: there\u2019s a real relish about her vocal delivery, a raw, dirty power about the ultra-distorted sound.\n\n36. The Sky Lit Up (1998)\n\nHarvey has always been skilled at juxtaposing wildly different musical and lyrical moods. The Sky Lit Up\u2019s power is derived from the way the lyric sounds punch-drunk with love, but the music and vocal tells a completely different story: relentless, repetitious, feedback-strafed, manic.\n\n35. Man-Size (1993)\n\nThere is a sense in which Harvey was always ahead of the game: were Man-Size released today, it would be acclaimed as a powerful meditation on gender fluidity and sexual identity. Its lyrics somehow manage to be abstract and powerful: the unremitting one-note chug of its guitars is as formidable as the figure they depict.\n\n34. That Was My Veil (1996)\n\nHer record label apparently claimed that Harvey\u2019s first collaborative album with John Parish, Dance Hall at Louse Point, was \u201ccommercial suicide\u201d, but listening to That Was My Veil, it is hard to see what the problem was: it\u2019s a fantastic song, Parish\u2019s music so in tune with Harvey\u2019s lyric you would never know two writers were involved.\n\n33. The Sandman (2019)\n\nHarvey\u2019s score for a new stage adaptation of the 1950 film All About Eve \u201cexplores the more sombre and deeply psychological aspects of the story\u201d: you don\u2019t say. Sung by Gillian Anderson, The Sandman\u2019s melody is exquisite, but its mood is pretty sepulchral. Put it this way: she doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s in for a good night\u2019s sleep.\n\n32. The Words That Maketh Murder (2011)\n\nMore bizarre juxtaposition. The jaunty, brass-assisted music somehow makes the battlefield testimony in the lyrics more harrowing: \u201cI\u2019ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat \u2026 arms and legs hanging in the trees\u201d. Weirder still, it ends with a jokey paraphrase from Eddie Cochran\u2019s Summertime Blues: \u201cWhat if I take my problem to the United Nations?\u201d\n\n31. The Darker Days of Me & Him (2004)\n\nA gem hidden among the uneven Uh Huh Her, an album on which Harvey played every instrument. Its lo-fi quality really works here. There is a mesmerising contrast between the sinister, foggy backing and Harvey\u2019s plaintive vocal and acoustic guitar: \u201cI long for a land with no neurosis, no psychosis, no psychoanalysis\u201d.\n\n30. Working for the Man (1995)\n\nThe main character in Working For the Man could, theoretically be a travelling salesman with religious leanings, but it seems considerably more likely he\u2019s a serial killer: certainly, the murmured, close-mic\u2019d vocal and skulking spookiness of the music \u2013 not to mention its abrupt ending \u2013 suggest something very unpleasant indeed.\n\n29. Oh My Lover (1992)\n\nThe opening track of Harvey\u2019s debut album loudly announced the arrival of a singer-songwriter operating in a space entirely her own. There is a hint of Pixies about the music, but the words shift uncomfortably, powerfully, from drowsily sexy to neurotic and fixated.\n\n28. Crawl Home (2003)\n\nHarvey\u2019s contribution to Volume 9 of Josh Homme\u2019s Desert Sessions are among the highlights of the series to date. Crawl Home\u2019s lyrics are very much within her wheelhouse \u2013 sickly, obsessive love \u2013 and she sounds utterly imperious over the maelstrom of heavy riffs.\n\n27. This Wicked Tongue (2000)\n\nIt says something about the quality of material on Stories From the City \u2026 that a song as good as This Wicked Tongue was relegated to hidden-track status. In fact, the earlier Peel Session version may be the definitive one. Tougher and noisier, it fits the lyric\u2019s apocalyptic darkness: \u201cWhere\u2019s the heart in the rubbish heap of man?\u201d\n\n26. Me-Jane (1993)\n\nThe swaggering machismo of the old Bo Diddley hambone beat chaotically, thrillingly pressed into the service of a song about the idiocy of swaggering machismo: \u201cOh damn your chest-beating,\u201d offers the narrator, clearly thoroughly bored of life as Tarzan\u2019s significant other, \u201cjust stop your screaming.\u201d\n\n25. The Piano (2007)\n\nDespite being unable to play the song\u2019s titular instrument, Harvey nonetheless made it the centrepiece of White Chalk and sang in a higher register than usual for good measure. The results of this journey outside her comfort zone were eerie and spare, as beautifully demonstrated here.\n\n24. The Dancer (1995)\n\nIn retrospect, it seems faintly amazing that To Bring You My Love was a commercial breakthrough: admittedly less confrontational than Rid of Me, it was still deeply uneasy listening, as evidenced by The Dancer, a stunning exercise in trembling tension, filled with dark religious imagery and references to opera. A love song, no less.\n\n23. You Said Something (2000)\n\nHarvey was at pains to suggest that Stories From the City \u2026 was not her \u201cNew York album\u201d. For all its geographical references to Manhattan, You Said Something sounds weirdly British \u2013 there is a distinctly folky lilt to the guitars \u2013 making it the perfect summation of the album\u2019s Englishwoman-abroad theme.\n\n22. A Perfect Day Elise (1998)\n\nOppressive and claustrophobic, A Perfect Day Elise is packed with sound: flickering guitar, thick waves of synthesiser, hammering drums, growling bass. The chorus offers a ray of light among the gloom \u2013 it sounds oddly uplifting by comparison with the rest of the song \u2013 but the real power lies in its dense urgency.\n\n21. April (2009)\n\nHarvey sings April in a strange, thin, high voice, as if she is playing a character much older than herself, which adds an emotive punch to the song\u2019s vision of the seasons passing. The music, meanwhile, is just beautiful: bare and melancholy.\n\n20. Rub Til It Bleeds (1993)\n\nAs ferocious screw-you statements of unbiddable artistic independence go, Harvey\u2019s major label debut takes some beating. Which brings us to Rub Til It Bleeds: five crawling, anxiety-inducing minutes during which Harvey offers to \u2013 and let us not mince words here \u2013 wank someone off so violently she draws blood. See you on Top of the Pops!\n\n19. Reeling (1993)\n\nHarvey\u2019s 4-Track Demos album is more than a fans-only curio. It offers a different, but equally compelling, kind of intensity to the Steve Albini productions on Rid of Me, as evidenced by Reeling: a scourging blast of fizzing, trebly noise and vocals on the edge of mania.\n\n17. On Battleship Hill (2011)\n\nYou would describe On Battleship Hill\u2019s keening vocal and folk-inspired melody as pastoral, but it is hardly a hymn to bucolic serenity: a walk through a former battlefield, unable to shake its lingering sense of death, troubled by the thought that, this time, human nature has irrevocably ruined nature itself.\n\n16. C\u2019mon Billy (1995)\n\nTo Bring You My Love saw Harvey abandoning her original guitar-bass-drums trio and expanding her sound: certainly, C\u2019Mon Billy\u2019s luscious strings would have had no place on Rid of Me. But she didn\u2019t diminish the potency of her music: the rawness of her voice snags on the silkiness of the arrangement, the desperation in the lyrics is almost tangible.\n\n15. Dress (1991)\n\nA striking exercise in simmering anger, Dress takes a straightforward indie rock topic \u2013 unrequited love \u2013 and pushes it somewhere darker: by the song\u2019s end, you\u2019re not entirely sure what\u2019s happened to its protagonist (\u201ca fallen woman in a dancing costume\u201d), but it doesn\u2019t sound good.\n\n14. The Ministry of Defence (2016)\n\nA super-heavy, super-simple, pounding garage riff and discordant free-blowing sax supporting a brilliant lyric. It starts out flatly describing a derelict building in Afghanistan \u2013 covered in graffiti, filled with litter and broken glass \u2013 that suddenly pans out to reveal the full horror: human bones and hair, the ghosts of children killed there.\n\n13. Silence (2007)\n\nFor all its unsettling, uncanny atmosphere, White Chalk contains some of Harvey\u2019s most lambent and straightforwardly beautiful tunes: there is almost nothing to Silence beyond a simple piano part and a harmonium, but the melody is so beautiful, it undercuts the obsessional, romantically devastated lyrics.\n\n12. Black Hearted Love (2009)\n\nHarvey has protested that her collaborative albums with John Parish have been unfairly overlooked, and Black Hearted Love ably proves her point with its simultaneously erotic and menacing lyrics, set to a gloriously unpredictable chord sequence and an addictive riff.\n\n11. This Is Love (2000)\n\nThis Is Love is relatively straightforward by Harvey\u2019s standards \u2013 a muscular garage rock strut with a lyric that seems to play with her Queen of Darkness image. There is something hugely appealing about hearing a woman who has previously threatened to do all sorts of appalling things in song suddenly turning into Benny Hill: \u201cI want to chase you round the table!\u201d\n\n10. 50ft Queenie (1993)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you my name: F-U-C-K!\u201d If her debut album was frequently concerned with women suffering at the hands of men, Rid of Me\u2019s 50ft Queenie was its negative image, a raw, messy, defiant subversion of the blues\u2019 masculine strut that celebrates vengeful female power: \u201cBend over, Casanova\u201d.\n\n9. The Wheel (2016)\n\nThe warped garage rock sound that defined The Hope Six Demolition Project in full effect. Thumping drums; Bad Seeds-y massed vocals; sleazy saxophone to the fore; a lyric that contemplates the mass-murder of \u201cdisappeared\u201d children. No U2-ish hectoring, just observation, and all the more potent and affecting for that.\n\n8. Angelene (1998)\n\nIs This Desire? was a thorny, troubled album, made at a time when worrying rumours circulated about Harvey\u2019s mental health. Angelene doesn\u2019t sound like the work of someone in a good place, but there\u2019s a hint of optimism \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve heard there\u2019s joy untold\u201d \u2013 mirrored by a chorus delightfully at odds with the mood of brooding weariness.\n\n7. The Desperate Kingdom of Love (2004)\n\nUh Huh Her is Harvey\u2019s messiest, most difficult album \u2013 in places, it sounds bafflingly half-finished \u2013 but amid the chaos, she hid one of her greatest songs, a simple, vaguely country-ish acoustic guitar ballad so timelessly beautiful it sounds like it might have existed for decades: remembered, rather than freshly written.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Harvey in 1995. Photograph: Brian Rasic/Brian Rasic/Getty Images\n\n6. Written on the Forehead (2011)\n\nThere is a compelling argument that Let England Shake is Harvey\u2019s masterpiece: its richness and breadth are clear here, an implausibly pretty, echo-drenched song about rioting cities and drowning in sewage, bolstered by a sample from Niney the Observer\u2019s 1970 reggae hit Blood and Fire.\n\n5. Sheela Na Gig (1992)\n\nNo wonder Harvey\u2019s debut album had such an impact: no one else in 1992 was writing songs quite like Sheela Na Gig, a ferociously eloquent assault on the male gaze and misogyny with the image of a grotesque medieval architectural depiction of female genitalia at its centre.\n\n4. Good Fortune (2000)\n\nIt is rare that Harvey pays obvious tribute to her musical inspirations, but Stories From the City\u2019s standout track is self-evidently a loving homage to Horses-era Patti Smith, from the churning guitar to her vocal intonation: the lyrics, meanwhile, perfectly depict a sudden flush of optimism.\n\n3. When Under Ether (2007)\n\nAn astonishing choice for a single \u2013 if nothing else, it demonstrated how far outside the mainstream Harvey works \u2013 but also an astonishing song: a solo piano track that seemingly, but not definitely, depicts a termination from the mother\u2019s point of view. Sung in a fragile, dreamy voice, it\u2019s extraordinarily beautiful and utterly chilling.\n\n2. Down By the Water (1995)\n\nThe PJ Harvey song that even people who find PJ Harvey too much seem to love, Down By the Water is still remarkably strong stuff: a song about a mother murdering her daughter, apparently for some sexual transgression, set to abrasive distorted organ, ending with a whispered, spine-chilling nursery rhyme.\n\n1. Rid of Me (1993)\n\nIt is hard to pick a definitive favourite from PJ Harvey\u2019s catalogue because she has maintained a remarkably high standard for nearly 30 years: even her least successful albums are still a cut above. But Rid of Me\u2019s title track is as strong a contender as any: a brutally powerful song that homes in on the moment when the aftermath of a breakup turns desperate and nasty, it comes packed with distressing imagery \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ll make you lick my injuries\u201d \u2013 as it switches from teary pleading to threats of violence. The music stretches the Pixies/Nirvana quiet-loud dynamic to its elastic limit and the song is half over before the cathartic explosion comes. It is thrilling and perturbing: search YouTube to see her performing it solo live, without losing any of the visceral power.", "description": "In the week that Polly Harvey turns 50, what better time to look back over 50 gems from her back catalogue \u2013 and sort them in order of greatness", "authors": ["Alexis Petridis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6743f63e84c6f0e13cd9e6e11fb5bd5c992c4dab/48_1017_2453_1471/master/2453.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6345fe08ec02d3467c291f7c2ca6cac8", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
