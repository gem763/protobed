After the Steinhoff scandal broke, the car was returned. There was a delay due in part to the leader\u2019s international trip to the US and a federal congress taking place in Gauteng,\u201d said George.\n\nCity Press and its sister publication Rapport last month reported that while the DA MPs were busy hauling Steinhoff\u2019s Markus Jooste over the coals regarding hundreds of millions of rands being wiped from the company\u2019s books amid allegations of corporate fraud, Maimane was driving a car that was given to the DA by Jooste.\n\nIt was alleged that Maimane refused to return the vehicle for months, despite desperate warnings from colleagues about the possible associated risks for him and the party. But this investigation has cleared the under-fire DA leader.\n\nThe house\n\nGeorge added that as it related to the leader\u2019s home \u2013 City Press reported last month that Maimane had declared the R4-million residence as his own, even though deeds office records contradicted this \u2013 he had not found any apparent misconduct.\n\n\u201cIt has been established that no formal lease document exists. However, Mr Maimane has paid rent covering each month he and his family have lived in the house. I have had sight of the accounts of the business which owns the house,\u201d said George.\n\nRead: Various leaders approached me: Zille to contest DA chair\n\nHe found that Maimane made \u201can initial deposit of R450 000\u201d and \u201cfrom April 2018, an amount of R18 400 was deducted per month as rental\u201d from the DA leader\u2019s account.\n\n\u201cThe current balance is R100 540 and the utility bill payments are made separately by Mr Maimane and in addition to this rental amount,\u201d found the internal investigation.\n\nNeither Maimane nor his trust owned shares in the business under which the home was registered.\n\n\u201cTherefore I am satisfied that there exists no financial illegality on behalf of Mr Maimane as it pertains to both the house and the car,\u201d concluded George.", "description": "The Democratic Alliance\u2019s finance committee \u2013 a unit within the party that acts as custodian of the party\u2019s assets, financial regulations and ethics \u2013 has found no wrongdoing with regards to its leader Mmusi Maimane and his use of a Toyota Fortuner d", "authors": ["Staff Reporter"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8852/5f7cbb0698db4ad78c974dae3f9f1ab7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
