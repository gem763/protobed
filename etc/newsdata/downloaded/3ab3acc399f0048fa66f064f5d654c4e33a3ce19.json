It always comes with a cost.\n\nIf you have ever owned dogs, you know of their natural love for the outdoors, for hunting, for retrieving, for a good run. You have seen the laughter in a Labrador\u2019s eyes when she knows you are about to let her off her leash. You have felt her heart pound with joy as she knew she was about to romp in the fields, swim in a lake or roam in the local woods. You have witnessed, firsthand, what it looks like to love freedom.\n\nHowever, if you are a responsible owner and you honestly love your dog, you also know something else. You understand she can never be let loose of the restrictions of a chain, the confines of a kennel or the boundaries of a backyard until she has first acquired discipline.\n\nA dog can never enjoy \u201cfreedom\u201d until she learns to obey. Oh, your dog may be \u201cfree\u201d to ignore you and your commands. She may be \u201cfree\u201d to walk away rather than sit, stay or heel. She may be \u201cfree\u201d to defy your rules and restrictions. She may be \u201cfree\u201d to think she is the master, and you\u2019re not. But such disobedience is a story of sadness, and not one of joy because you know that in her ignorant and stubborn way of living your dog is not experiencing a fraction of the freedom that could be hers.\n\nYou know if she would listen and accept a few simple boundaries, you could let her go. You know if she would obey your commands, she would be free. She wouldn\u2019t need a kennel or a backyard fence any longer if you could trust her to stay out of the road and away from traffic. She could have total freedom and the run of the property if she just learned to obey some basic rules established for her good and stay away from things that you know could kill her.\n\nThe simplicity of a dog\u2019s life \u2014 this lesson of Blue \u2014 highlights the fact that freedom is never enjoyed without first paying the price of obedience. No one experiences the \u201cgain\u201d of emancipation without first submitting to the \u201cpain\u201d of correction. Good things never come without a cost. In other words, the payment for liberty is found in the currency of submission.\n\nG.K. Chesterton once said that when you get rid of the Big Laws, you don\u2019t get liberty but, rather, thousands of little laws that rush in to fill the vacuum. His point was that there is an undeniable paradox of discipline and freedom. Liberty is a direct consequence of knowing and honoring the Big Laws.\n\nOur understanding of these laws has been endowed to us by our Creator, and our willingness to voluntarily live by them is the only foundation we have for truly being free. Law does not override personal initiative. Law leads to freedom just as rhythm and beat, tone, and cadence lead to Mozart. Ignoring the rules of music results in chaos, not concertos. Ignoring the laws of nature given to us by nature\u2019s God leads to slavery, not salvation.\n\nSomeone else once said that freedom is found in knowing and obeying the truth: \u201cYou shall know the Truth and the Truth shall set you free.\u201d\n\nMaybe this is Chesterton\u2019s point.\n\nYour dog will never be free until she learns to live within the boundaries created for her own good. Likewise, we will never enjoy freedom until we learn to submit to the few simple laws given to us by God (He only gave us 10 after all, and Jesus summarized them in two). Failing to do so never ends in freedom, but rather in thousands upon thousands of little laws being forced upon us by government.\n\nRemember this the next time you see your dog running in the fields, delighted with the freedom she enjoys by obeying her master\u2019s voice. You also might want to remember this when you head to the ballot box to vote.\n\n\u2022 Everett Piper, former president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, is a columnist for The Washington Times and author of \u201cNot A Day Care: The Devastating Consequences of Abandoning Truth\u201d (Regnery 2017).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
