migrants to north 'confused and unworkable gimmick'", "language": "en", "text": "Get the biggest politics stories by email Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our

\u201cconfused\u201d and an unworkable \u201cgimmick\u201d.\n\nNew immigration rules will be among around 22 laws proposed at today\u2019s State Opening of Parliament.\n\nThe Government wants to introduce an Australia-style points-based system, which Ukip has previously backed.\n\nIt would score potential migrants based on their education, skills and expected salary level.\n\nBut Home Secretary Priti Patel wants to make the system more generous to people willing to live outside London.\n\nLabour \u2019s Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott said the plan would fail \u2013 and would do nothing to solve the shortage of workers in the NHS.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe Home Secretary appears to be very confused.\n\n\u201cThe points system would be designed to increase migration, but the Tories have been promising to cut immigration.\n\n\u201cThere is no workable system to encourage or divert migrants to some parts of the country, and not others.\n\n\u201cTrying to prevent people moving to where the jobs are would be ridiculous.\n\nShe said it was a \u201cfallacy\u201d the country only needed \u201cso-called skilled workers,\u201d to work in overstretched public services.\n\n\u201cThe NHS has shortages of more than 100,000 staff,\u201d Ms Abbott added.\n\n\u201cWe need doctors, nurses, hospital porters, chefs and cleaners.\u201d\n\n(Image: Hollie

Prime Minister.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s speech will be debated by MPs and faces a vote next Monday or Tuesday.\n\nBut the PM is 40 votes short of a House of Commons majority and could see his agenda rejected.\n\nThat would not automatically trigger an election, but it would leave the Government without a legislative plan and struggling to govern.\n\nAnd it is likely the opposition would then call a vote of confidence to bring down the Government.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn dismissed the speech as a \u201cparty political broadcast from the steps of the throne\u201d and said there was a \u201cstrong possibility\u201d of an election before Christmas.\n\nHe added it was \u201cludicrous\u201d for the Government to try to introduce new laws when it had no majority.\n\nOpposition MPs blasted Ms Patel\u2019s \u201chalf-baked\u201d bid to spread newcomers around the country by giving bonus points for choosing low-income areas.\n\nThey said it showed she was out of touch with life outside of London.\n\nRedcar\u2019s Anna Turley said: \u201cManaged immigration brings huge benefits and the North is a great and welcoming place to live and work.\n\n\u201cBut this half-baked plan smacks of a London-centric Government treating people as a problem and places in the North as somewhere that can be used to fix a Government mess.\n\n\u201c[They] have learnt nothing from the Brexit vote that people here are fed up of being \u2018done to\u2019 and not given respect from Westminster or a say in decisions that affect them.\u201d\n\nWigan MP Lisa Nandy said: \u201cInstead of gimmicks cooked up in Whitehall she needs to give us the funding and powers to bring good jobs back and let us invest in young people.\u201d\n\nAnd John Mann, for Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire, encouraged Ms Patel to see what life was like outside of the Westminster bubble.\n\n\u201cA visit up north is always a learning experience for London centric Ministers,\u201d he said.\n\nMs Patel claimed ahead of the speech she would also crack down on foreign criminals, with new extradition rules and tougher sentences for violent and sexual offenders.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s speech is also set to include the Domestic Abuse Bill, which had almost passed when Mr Johnson shut Parliament down.\n\nPlans to scrap railway franchising, introduced when the Tories privatised the rail network in the 1990s, are also set to be announced.\n\nIt would be replaced with a \u201cnew commercial model\u201d Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said.\n\nHealth reforms include a new independent body to oversee patient safety and changes to the Mental Health Act, aimed at improving treatment and cutting the number of detentions.\n\nCriminal sanctions for breaching building regulations, after the Grenfell Tower disaster, are also on the cards.", "description": "New rule designed to encourage migrants to go north has been slammed by Diane Abbott who says it's based on a 'fallacy'", "authors": ["Mikey
