It's about playing football,' Nagy said.\n\nIn a game littered with errors, Oakland raced into a 17-0 lead at half-time before the Bears scored 21 unanswered points. Oakland retook the lead late in the fourth quarter largely thanks to coach Jon Gruden's fake punt on a fourth and one.\n\n'Yeah, yeah, you know that. You've still got to stop it. We knew that it could certainly come. You've got to stop it,' Nagy said.\n\nAfter back-up quarterback Chase Daniel led them to a win against NFC North rivals Minnesota last week, the Bears came back to earth with an uneven performance from the signal-caller.\n\nDaniel, who threw two costly interceptions, shouldered the blame: 'It's completely on me. Yeah, I mean, there's no excuses for it. You're in a chance to - you're 16, 17 yards away with a chance to tie the game and send it to overtime, and I like our chances the way we've been playing really in the second half.\n\nPass rusher Khalil Mack had a frustrating afternoon against his former team\n\n'It's unfortunate, just we didn't get a lot of chances in the first half, and when we did we turned the ball over. I took a sack. We couldn't stay on the field. We weren't very good.'\n\nThe Bears managed only 236 total yards and 42 rushing yards and lost pass rusher Akiem Hicks early in the game.", "description": "It has become commonplace for NFL teams to arrive late in the week before playing\u00a0 in London.\u00a0The Chicago Bears landed on Friday - and it took them half of the game to wake up.", "authors": ["Peter Carline For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/00/19374564-0-image-a-5_1570405589358.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
