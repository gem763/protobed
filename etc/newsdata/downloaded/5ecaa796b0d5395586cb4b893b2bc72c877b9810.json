I didn't believe they were true Conservatives,' he said. 'I have made big donations in the past \u2013 in the Thatcher days and in the initial years of John Major's government \u2013 but not after that.\n\nStanding tall: Sir Rocco Forte is a strong supporter of Prime Minister Boris Johnson\n\n'Brexit is very frustrating, but Boris has changed the atmosphere significantly.\n\n'We were in a gloomy, depressing mode and he has done what everybody said he couldn't do, which is persuade the European Union to open up the withdrawal agreement and change it.\n\n'Boris, at least, is trying all the time. He doesn't give up when there is a setback. He carries on.\n\n'I supported him when he stood for London Mayor the first time.'\n\nForte also paid for a \u00a312,000 party at Brown's Hotel to celebrate Johnson's victory in the Tory leadership contest.\n\n'I believe it is less likely we get Corbyn now than with Theresa May. Boris has positioned himself so when an election is held he is appealing to the blue-collar worker, which hasn't been the case since Mrs Thatcher.\n\n'Boris has a positive message, and he believes in capitalism. It looks as though the Brexit Party vote has collapsed. For the European elections, a lot of people like me voted for the Brexit Party to send a signal \u2013 but we are never going to vote for them in a general election.'\n\nSir Rocco is embarking on an expansion of his group, which he set up in 1996 after Trusthouse Forte, the FTSE 100 company set up by his father, was taken over in a hostile bid by TV and leisure giant Granada.\n\nHe founded the luxury chain with his sister Olga Polizzi. The siblings have since built a portfolio of 14 properties. The plan is to have 25 to 30 hotels in major European cities over the next three to five years. He plans to open four hotels in Italy and one in China next year.\n\nForte says he writes a personal letter to customers when they have stayed 100 nights in his group hotels. 'I just say thank you to them,' he says. The group recently reported record revenues of \u00a3219m and investment of \u00a353.4m in new hotels and refurbishments. It paid out \u00a33.1m in dividends. Forte and his family own 75 per cent.\n\nThe UK hotels have seen 15 per cent growth in the past year, partly thanks to the weakness of the pound which makes coming to this country cheaper for visitors from overseas.\n\nAll three of his children \u2013 Lydia, Irene and Charles \u2013 are involved in the business and wife Aliai is on the board.\n\nAged 74, Forte \u2013 who is known for his hard-core fitness regime \u2013says: 'I'm not planning on stepping down at the moment. I don't do triathlons any more, but I train at least five days a week.'", "description": "The entrepreneur, who is chairman and founder of the luxury Rocco Forte Hotels group including Brown's Hotel in Mayfair,  is a strong supporter of the Prime Minister.", "authors": ["Ruth Sunderland For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
