Like all successful relationships, this takes some work from both parties. My work in this relationship mainly consists of not entering into the domain of the lion, and the work the lions put in consists of not murdering me. It takes some effort, sure. But it works.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that this is the approach that everyone has to take, but I would definitely recommend against this approach:\n\nCaptured in the above video (taken by a fellow visitor to New York City\u2019s Bronx Zoo on Saturday) is a woman entering into a lion enclosure and seemingly attempting to get its attention by waving at it.\n\nThe woman, who has not been identified, hopped a fence and stood across from the moat from the lion while onlookers very quietly suggested that maybe that was not a great idea. A spokesperson for the Bronx Zoo told CNN that, while nothing bad happened this time, it could well have: \u201cThis action was a serious violation and unlawful trespass that could have resulted in serious injury or death.\u201d\n\nAccording to CNN, the police were not called at all in relation to the incident and no arrest was made at the time, although the zoo filed a criminal trespass complaint with the NYPD.\n\nMy advice, if you want it? Don\u2019t do this. Not a good idea.", "description": "If you can manage it, I would very much suggest that you do not wander into the lion enclosure like this woman did at The Bronx Zoo.", "authors": ["Ben Mcleay"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-02-at-10.17.48-pm.png"}
