Most trackers follow listed indices and therefore you can always sell the underlying investments.\n\nWeak link: Active funds try to outperform the market and are run by managers - such as Neil Woodford\n\n\u2018Also the investors in the fund are more likely to know what they have bought, so there is unlikely to be large sell-offs in a tracker.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a shame that it will put people off investing, but going passive is better than not investing at all.\u2019\n\nTracker funds attract new investors because they grow modest but stable returns over the long term without requiring you to have in-depth investment knowledge. They also tend to have lower fees as they do not require an active manager.\n\nJustin Modray, from Candid Money, recommends the Vanguard FTSE UK All-Share Index, which would have returned \u00a314,067 if you had invested \u00a310,000 five years ago, with an annual fee of 0.08 per cent.\n\nJames Norton, from Vanguard, says investors have started to question whether fund managers\u2019 fees are value for money.\n\nHe says: \u2018There are skilled active managers out there, but high costs often kills their return. I have a management fee of 1 per cent and I need a return of above that to do as well as the market does.\u2019\n\nMr Modray says a worthy active fund is Franklin UK Equity Income, which has provided a five-year return of \u00a315,207 on a \u00a310,000 investment, with an annual fee of 0.52 per cent.\n\nAnalysts insist there is still space for skilled fund managers acting with conviction.\n\nTrackers are all well and good when the market is growing, but quick-thinking managers can come into their own during a downturn.\n\nm.dilworth@dailymail.co.uk", "description": "Many fund managers fear that the collapse of Neil Woodford's investment empire - valued at \u00a315 billion at its peak - could be a hammer blow to the public's confidence in star stock pickers.", "authors": ["Miles Dilworth For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
