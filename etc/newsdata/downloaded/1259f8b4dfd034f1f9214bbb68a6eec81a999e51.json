The industry is worth \u00a33.3bn.\n\n\u201cEverything I\u2019ve heard suggests that the market will continue to grow,\u201d said Libby Peake, a senior policy adviser at independent think tank Green Alliance.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

However, researchers have found that biodegradable plastic bags can still be in tact after three years at sea.\n\nImportantly, neither of these terms mean that the material can break down in the natural environment.\n\nMs Peake said: \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of confusion across the board and also about the different terminology. Some companies are saying \u2018these are biodegradable\u2019 and the term doesn\u2019t have a standard attached to it \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have a time span or condition attached to it.\n\n\u201cI heard a woman talking about biodegradable cups and I heard her say, \u2018They\u2019re a bit more expensive but they\u2019re great because you can just chuck them on the ground when you\u2019re done\u2019.\n\n\u201cI do think that\u2019s a common misconception and people hear the term biodegradable and they do do that. That will make pollution even worse.\u201d\n\nAccording to an investigation by Greenpeace published earlier this month, companies investing in emerging \u201crecycling\u201d technologies are offering \u201cfalse hope\u201d. Their report found that just because a product is compostable, biodegradable or made from plants, that does not mean it is good for the environment.\n\nMs Peake said: \u201cThe rolling-out of compostable plastic is absolutely going too fast at the moment and there is a disconnect in how different government departments are tackling this. Really what you\u2019d want to see is assurance that you\u2019re only putting them on the market in places where they make sense.\u201d\n\nExperts say tap water in refillable containers is by far the most sustainable option. Greenpeace also found that companies will only reduce their environmental footprint by encouraging people to reuse materials.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at how you can tackle plastics in a way that isn\u2019t just banning cotton buds or seeing a rise in these other types of materials,\u201d said Ms Peake.\n\nThe amount of bottled water sold in the UK has doubled in the past 15 years and continues to rise, with the average adult going through 150 plastic water bottles a year.\n\nIt is estimated that by 2050 there will be 12 billion tons of plastic polluting the natural environment.", "description": "There are more plastic water bottles being sold in the UK than ever\u00a0\u2013 and\u00a0robust growth\u00a0is expected\u00a0for brands using\u00a0alternative materials\u00a0despite widespread campaigns to reduce\u00a0single-use items.
