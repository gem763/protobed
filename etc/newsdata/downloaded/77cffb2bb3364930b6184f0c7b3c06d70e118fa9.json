I wasn't allowed to wear the same clothes as my friends, and at 13 you really don't understand why\u2026. Like ''If you show them off you're looking for male attention or you're a s**t'' or whatever it is.\n\n'It took me years and years and years to think ''oh I don't need to have a boob job.'' This is my body and my body is not my morals and doesn't dictate whether I'm an attention seeker or not.'\n\nOpen: The Celebrity Big Brother star exclusively told MailOnline she struggled to find clothes to fit her large bust, and it took years for her to come to terms with her shape\n\nAshley also revealed that since her career has taken off she has focused more on how she dresses, but prefers not to worry about her weight.\n\nShe added: 'I wasn't particularly fashion conscious, I didn't care about my appearance as much but as more I didn't really know what to wear.\n\n'I do photo shoots or I have stylists for events so I've learned much more about dressing in a way that suits me. I used to have one dress that I would wear going out for university. I didn't have a lot of clothes or money.'\n\nConfident: Ashley has long been an advocate for body confidence, but admitted she doesn't like to focus on her weight\n\nSpeaking about averting focus away from her weight, she added: 'I'm on a trip with a few girls and one of them was saying ''I've put on a stone'' and I said how do you know and she said ''scales.'' I was just saying '''why do you care?''. She said ''but my clothes don't fit'' and I said ''buy a bigger size then.'' It's frustrating to make people realise it's about confidence.\n\n'It's not just a number or a scale or a size in a piece of clothing, we all know i could be a 6, 8, 10 or 12 depending on where I go shopping.'\n\nAshley also exclusively revealed that she is finally ready to find love after six years of being single, but having grown comfortable with supporting herself, she has no plans to settle in her search for Mr Right.\n\nShe previously dated The Xtra Factor host Matt Richardson, but the couple split in 2014.\n\nOn a mission: Ashley also exclusively revealed that she is finally ready to find love after six years of being single, but has no plans to settle in her search for Mr Right\n\nAshley added: 'I've been officially single for six years and I feel like I'm really pleased I've had that time in a way because I've got to do loads of things that people miss out on, like I'll do couples' things with my friends.\n\n'I put a lot of investment into my friendship but I definitely feel like I'm ready to meet the right person, but I'll never settle. Being on my own has given me an appreciation of knowing I can be happy by myself.\n\n'I'm in a position where I don't need to financially rely on anyone, but still I'm a hopeless romantic and I've had my heart broken.\n\n'It's hardest because the older you get the fussier you are, but I'm ready and I'm looking forward to meeting my soulmate, but whether that's next week or in two years I don't know.'\n\nWhen asked whether she's planning to find her man through a dating app, or in the old-fashion way, Ashley said: 'I don\u2019t really have a physical type so I find it hard with online dating apps, I find it\u2019s important having a connection, what if the love of your like puts up a gym selfie?\n\n'I\u2019d think he\u2019s put up a gym selfie absolutely not. I feel with the dating apps I think they\u2019re great and I know people that are married from meeting on dating apps, but any time I\u2019ve met someone it\u2019s from an instant connection.\n\n'I wouldn\u2019t be opposed to it but for me natural connections is important, but I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m a traditionalist, I don\u2019t want to get married but I\u2019d love a big family.'\n\nWow! Ashley's interview came as her sustainable collection with Little Mistress was officially unveiled, with the garments created from recycled plastic bottles\n\nAshley's interview came as her sustainable collection with Little Mistress was officially unveiled, with the garments created from recycled plastic bottles.\n\nThe star explained that she after seeing the damage that plastic pollution had been doing to her oceans first-hand, she was determined to offer a positive contribution to the rapidly increasing fad of fast fashion.\n\nShe said: 'One of the things I find challenging and difficult is having big boobs and curves even though I\u2019m quite small, it's really hard to dress your body in a way that\u2019s flattering and makes you feel sexy, it\u2019s a hard balance.\n\n'Every bit of my collection is really fitted and it celebrates the hourglass shape. It\u2019s all really fitted around the waist and shows cleavage but a nice amount of cleavage, it\u2019s sexy but you can wear it out in the day.\n\n'I wanted to do colourful so I went for a really bold blue for the suit and one of the dress' and leopard print since I love leopard print. I was trying to push the boat out a little bit but make sure it\u2019s something you can wear for different occasions.'\n\nDetermined: As an advocate of body confidence, Ashley also spoke about how she tackles social media abuse\n\nAshley added: 'I do a few talks at unis and schools and I was shocked to know that one of the girls told me if they get tagged in an outfit on Instagram they won\u2019t wear that outfit again, for me that\u2019s crazy.\n\n'People are buying and getting rid of things very quickly, and we need to find a solution to the overuse of plastic. We can all do our bit, but if we can find a way to do fast fashion but do it in a way that\u2019s helping in its own way.'\n\nAs an advocate of loving the skin you're in, Ashley also spoke about she tackles social media negativity, and explained that her Celebrity Big Brother housemate Ann Widdecombe, 72, offered some much-needed inspiration.\n\nLovely: The star admitted that she is inspired from her Celebrity Big Brother housemate Ann Widdecombe, 72, when embracing her individuality (pictured on the show in 2018)\n\nShe said: 'It depends on my mindset but sometimes will respond [to comments] and say I don\u2019t know why you said that it\u2019s really upset me and they\u2019ll say ''oh I\u2019m sorry I was just looking for a response.'' Or other times I just ignore it.\n\n'Weirdly the most unlikely friendship what really helped me was when I did CBB Year Of The Woman was in there with Ann Widdecombe.\n\n'We are so politically different in our opinions and the first time we clashed, but once we started to see eye to eye, and I still meet up with her now, she\u2019s really given me the confidence to not care what people think. If someone calls me an attention seeker or you have big boobs it doesn\u2019t really change what I\u2019m about.\n\n'In Ann\u2019s house in Devon she\u2019s got you know when you\u2019re a politician there\u2019s the comic the satire comics, Ann\u2019s whole corridor when you go into her house is all these cartoons of her a tarantula and saying how tough she was during her political career.\n\n'And I was like I can\u2019t believe you have this\u2026 and as different as we are I feel like I\u2019ve learned a lot from her, I guess growing up in a snowflake generation she\u2019s taught me to care less what people think and it\u2019s made me stronger and happier.'\n\nAs a working presenter and DJ, Ashley said she wouldn't rule out taking part in another reality show, and would love to boost her competitive streak by taking part in I'm A Celebrity or The Island with Bear Grylls.", "description": "The CBB star, 32, exclusively told MailOnline as a teen she struggled to find clothes that would fit her large bust, as she officially launched her sustainable fashion line with Little Mistress.", "authors": ["Laura Fox For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/17/19794528-0-image-a-20_1571242288913.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
