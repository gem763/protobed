Or she says something crazy. ...\n\n\"The Clintons,\" he concluded, \"they've got to go away.\"\n\n\"I'm saying this a year out,\" he continued. \"They can't be at the convention. Maybe on the video, waving or something, but I\u2019m serious.\u201d\n\nMAHER WARNS DEMS PURSUING IMPEACHMENT: THE COUNTRY WILL BE 'PARALYZED FOR A LONG TIME'\n\nMaher then referred to a Twitter message posted by Rep. Justin Amash, I-Mich., who called Hillary Clinton a \"Donald Trump asset\" in reaction to her claim that Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, was a \"Russian asset\" who was being \"groomed\" to run as a third-party candidate in 2020.\n\n\"She is!\" Maher agreed. \"And Bill is damaged goods. And I just think they've got to go away. We can't be associating them with the Democratic Party.\"\n\nAnother panelist, MSNBC's Donny Deutsch, then cited the rise in popularity of President George W. Bush since he left the White House, suggesting that \"when time goes by\" people may view Bill Clinton more favorably.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"But [Clinton's] got worse!\" Maher said. \"We forgave him and then we unforgave him!\"\n\nDeustch ultimately agreed, however, that the Clintons should probably be elsewhere when Democrats convene July 13-16 of next year.", "description": "\"Real Time\" host Bill Maher urged the Clintons on Friday night to \"go away\" and skip next year's Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee.", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
