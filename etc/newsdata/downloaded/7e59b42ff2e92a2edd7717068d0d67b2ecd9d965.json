Infanticide among hippos is rare but may result from the stress caused through overcrowding when their day-resting pools dry out.

They believe the farming industry needs to change.\n\nEither way, research is increasingly showing badger culls look more like wild goose chases than a long term solution to tackling bovine TB.\n\nDefra should stop digging itself into a hole and start listening to what the scientists are saying.", "description": "The debate about culling badgers has raged on for decades \u2013 with farmers, conservationists and vets at loggerheads over\u00a0the best way to stop the spread of bovine tuberculosis (TB).
