GOP lawmakers have also blasted Democrats for not releasing the transcripts of testimony from witnesses who gave their depositions in private.\n\nHouse Democrats are considering opening the impeachment hearings to the public before Thanksgiving, CNN reported Tuesday.\n\nEchoing the New York Times and the Washington Post, CNN noted Monday:\n\nHouse Democrats are discussing a time frame that would include public impeachment hearings before Thanksgiving and votes on whether to impeach Trump by Christmas, according to multiple Democratic sources. But Pelosi did not put a time frame on it at a closed-door leadership meeting on Monday to discuss the resolution and she has been hesitant to do so, as the timing is subject to change depending on how witnesses cooperate or if additional leads come up, according to multiple Democrats. Still, the working theory among Democrats is there will be another week or two of closed depositions, and that public hearings before the House Intelligence Committee could begin as soon as the second week in November when Congress returns from a one-week recess.\n\n\u201cThe commencement of public hearings before Thanksgiving is a reasonable objective\u2014as it\u2019s important for Americans to begin seeing the evidence as soon as possible,\u201d Rep. Dean Phillips (D-MN) recently said, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIt remains unclear when, if ever, the Democrats will release the transcripts of the witness testimonies behind closed doors. Some Republicans have said some of those testimonies exonerate President Donald Trump from any wrongdoing.\n\nOn Tuesday, the House Democrat leaders introduced an eight-page impeachment inquiry resolution \u2014 likely to be voted on this week \u2014 that calls for public hearings.\n\nThe resolution also authorizes Democrat leaders \u201cto make publicly available in electronic form the transcripts of depositions.\u201d It appears that the measure leaves it up Democrats to decide which transcripts to release.\n\nSome Republicans have described the Democrats\u2019 sudden change of heart on making the hearings public as a capitulation to GOP criticism that the secret impeachment inquiry process is \u201cillegitimate\u201d and unfair.\n\nDemocrats reportedly insist the upcoming impeachment inquiry vote this week is not a formal authorization of the probe, but it still signals they are moving forward with the inquiry despite the refusal of several Trump administration witnesses to testify.\n\nEarlier this month, Schiff said he would hold public hearings, but would not say when.\n\nHe compared the impeachment probe to a \u201cgrand jury,\u201d but ultimately acknowledged that the analogy is \u201cimperfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a political process, and there are good reasons that part of that process should be conducted in the public eye,\u201d he said on October 14.", "description": "House Democrat impeachment investigators are reportedly considering holding public hearings before Thanksgiving after weeks of pressure.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/wi/afp/22/9f770a_us-president-donald-trump-pardons-turkey-peas-annual-ceremony-white-house.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
