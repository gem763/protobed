Yes, the Trump administration will for now keep a small number of forces in Syria around oil facilities in the north and at a base in the south, has yet to pull U.S. troops from conflict zones in Iraq and Afghanistan, and recently deployed thousands of American soldiers to Saudi Arabia after Iranian attacks on oil facilities there.\n\nBut what should be obvious to allies and adversaries alike from Trump\u2019s comments today, if it wasn\u2019t evident already, is that his heart isn\u2019t in these deployments and in involving the United States in any regional conflicts. The president\u2019s goal \u201cis to have all American troops out of Syria, and that\u2019s something that we believe will ultimately happen,\u201d a senior Trump-administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters after the president\u2019s speech.\n\nIn remarks that America\u2019s enemies, from ISIS to the Taliban to Iran will no doubt heed, Trump made clear that while he is willing to make some modest diplomatic and economic investments in molding developments, he has little appetite for expending military resources to secure U.S. interests\u2014even when it comes to something as central to the defense of the homeland as preventing the resurgence of the world\u2019s most virulent terrorist groups with, relative to the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a small deployment of U.S. troops.\n\n\u201cLet someone else fight over this long-bloodstained sand,\u201d Trump said today, regarding territory on which more than 11,000 Kurdish fighters perished in the fight against ISIS so U.S. troops didn\u2019t have to. (The president thanked these fighters for their \u201csacrifices\u201d and said they\u2019d \u201cbeen terrific.\u201d) The United States has done a \u201cgreat service\u201d and \u201cgreat job\u201d for Turkey, Syria, and the Kurds by engineering a pause in their perpetual fighting, he argued, \u201cand now we\u2019re getting out.\u201d\n\nRead: The intelligence fallout from Trump\u2019s withdrawal in Syria\n\nEven as he denounced Barack Obama for not retaliating militarily against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for using chemical weapons against civilians in 2013, Trump expressed the very same fatalism about the Middle East that had prevented his predecessor from pulling the trigger to enforce his infamous \u201cred line.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have avoided another costly military intervention that could\u2019ve led to disastrous, far-reaching consequences,\u201d Trump said of his decision not to oppose the incursion by Turkey. \u201cWe have spent $8 trillion on wars in the Middle East \u2026 But after all that money was spent and all of those lives lost, the young men and women gravely wounded\u2014so many\u2014the Middle East is less safe, less stable, and less secure than before these conflicts began.\u201d", "description": "The short-term costs have been brutal, but the longer-term ones could be far more significant.", "authors": ["Uri Friedman"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS2SHOT/facebook.jpg?1571866168", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
