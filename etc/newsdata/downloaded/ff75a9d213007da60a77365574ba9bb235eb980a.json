It is contrary to the Bible\u2019s teaching to treat folks like this so harshly. It\u2019s contrary to our American values of fairness and hope and justice. And you know what? It\u2019s just plain contrary to common sense,\u201d Dolan said.\n\n\u201cIn the name of our good God, let\u2019s tear down this place.\u201d\n\nThe city is pursuing a plan to close Rikers and replace it with four smaller jails, a blueprint which has become embroiled in controversy as it wends its way through the City Council. The proposal calls for a jail in each borough except for Staten Island, which proponents say would be better built, allow prisoners to maintain connections to their families and neighborhoods and speed up their processing by putting them closer to courts.\n\nBut neighborhood opponents have objected to the placement of the jails, saying the planned buildings are too big and some of the locations inappropriate. Activists on the left have attacked the plans on the grounds that the city should not be opening new jails at all.\n\nNew statistics just revealed in the Mayor\u2019s Management Report showed that violence has surged at the island jail complex \u2014 with attacks between inmates up 25 percent since 2018, and assaults against staff up more than a third.\n\nUse of force by guards against prisoners has also jumped nearly percent.\n\nJudge Jonathan Lippman, the former chief judge of the New York state court system who led a commission that recommended closing Rikers, said the spike in violence makes it \u201cso much more urgent\u201d to get the closure plan done quickly.\n\n\u201cRikers is a stain on the soul of New York City. ... Every day, human beings are suffering,\" he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do it now, it will be another 30 years.\u201d\n\nA federal investigation found the jail was a dysfunctional institution plagued by a deep-seated culture of violence.\n\nDolan said he has visited many jails and prisons, and while \u201cnone of them are Park Avenue condos,\u201d Rikers has stood out for its structural defects.\n\n\u201cWhat strikes me immediately when I go to Rikers is the dreariness of it, the isolation of it, the darkness of it,\u201d he said.", "description": "\u201cIn the name of our good God, let\u2019s tear down this place,\" he said.", "authors": ["Erin Durkin"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/26/aa/cb3fa48a4b78b031b44d99b32bc3/gettyimages-1036508818-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
