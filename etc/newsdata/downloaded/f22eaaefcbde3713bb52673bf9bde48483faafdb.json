She\u2019s repeatedly used the title to get ahead and documents show she listed herself as \u201cAmerican Indian\u201d on a Texas Bar registration card in 1986. In 1997, she was named Harvard\u2019s first woman of color by the Fordham Law Review. In 2010, Warren told a story of racism and discrimination within her own family.\n\n\u201cMy mom and dad were very much in love with each other and they wanted to get married and my father\u2019s parents said absolutely not. You can\u2019t marry her because she\u2019s part Cherokee and part Delaware. After fighting as long as they could, my parents went off, they eloped. It was an issue in our family the whole time I grew up about these two families. It was an issue still raised at my mother\u2019s funeral,\u201d Warren said during an interview with a local Massachusetts television station.\n\nMany people, including President Trump Donald John TrumpBusiness school deans call for lifting country-specific visa caps Bolton told ex-Trump aide to call White House lawyers about Ukraine pressure campaign: report Federal prosecutors in New York examining Giuliani business dealings with Ukraine: report MORE, questioned Warren\u2019s claims of tribal heritage. During her Senate campaign against Republican Sen. Scott Brown, the number of questions from Boston Globe reporters started to increase.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTwo months ahead of her announcement she would be running for president, Warren decided she was going to prove once and for all she was telling the truth and that the Cherokee tribe was truly part of her story.\n\nOn Oct. 15, 2018, a media campaign centered around the issue was launched. Team Warren published a new section on her website dedicated to the results of a DNA test. On Twitter, a lengthy video was heavily promoted as \u201cproof\u201d her claims were backed up by \u201cstrong evidence\u201d and science.\n\n\u201cMy family (including Fox News-watchers) sat together and talked about what they think of @realDonaldTrump\u2019s attacks on our heritage. And yes, a famous geneticist analyzed my DNA and concluded that it contains Native American ancestry,\u201d Warren tweeted.\n\nThe DNA test results showed Warren might be 1/1,024th American Indian. Pushing even more doubt into the results, her DNA wasn\u2019t compared to lineage of the Cherokee tribe. In fact, it immediately sparked backlash from the tribal nation and brought back horrific memories of a time when people\u2019s worth was judged through their bloodline.\n\n\u201cA DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship. Current DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person\u2019s ancestors were indigenous to North or South America. Sovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship, and while DNA tests can be used to determine lineage, such as paternity to an individual, it is not evidence for tribal affiliation,\u201d Cherokee Nation Secretary of State Chuck Hoskin Jr. released in a statement at the time. \u201cUsing a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong. It makes a mockery out of DNA tests and its legitimate uses while also dishonoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens, whose ancestors are well documented and whose heritage is prove. Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWarren\u2019s family story, especially of discrimination, victimhood and elopement because of her mother\u2019s alleged Cherokee heritage, completely fell apart. She\u2019s apologized privately to the tribe, but has never admitted she isn\u2019t Native American.\n\nNow, Warren is facing another controversy.\n\nOn the 2020 campaign trail, Warren isn\u2019t talking about her high-cheek bones, but instead about how she was fired from a job for being pregnant.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 22 and finishing my first year of teaching, I had an experience millions of women will recognize. By June I was visibly pregnant \u2014 and the principal told me the job I\u2019d already been promised for the next year would go to someone else,\u201d Warren tweeted. \u201cThis was 1971, years before Congress outlawed pregnancy discrimination \u2014 but we know it still happens in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. We can fight back by telling our stories. I tell mine on the campaign trail, and I hope to hear yours.\u201d\n\nThis is the same narrative she\u2019s been pushing on the campaign trail during her stump speeches with voters. But it isn\u2019t true. Warren wasn\u2019t fired from the job. In fact, she was asked to come back to the position and instead offered her resignation to pursue graduate school.\n\n\u201cThe Riverdale Board of Education approved a second-year teaching contract for a young Elizabeth Warren, documents show, contradicting the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s repeated claims that she was asked not to return to teaching after a single year because she was \u2018visibly pregnant,\u2019 \u201d the Washington Free Beacon recently reported. \u201cMinutes of an April 21, 1971, Riverdale Board of Education meeting obtained by the Washington Free Beacon show that the board voted unanimously on a motion to extend Warren a \u20182nd year\u2019 contract for a two-days-per-week teaching job. That job is similar to the one she held the previous year, her first year of teaching. Minutes from a board meeting held two months later, on June 16, 1971, indicate that Warren\u2019s resignation was \u2018accepted with regret.\u2019 \u201d [Editor\u2019s note: Warren stands by her original statement.]\n\nIn an attempt to court voters and score political points, Warren has repeatedly painted herself as a victim. The stories she\u2019s told aren\u2019t true, yet she keeps telling them. In the age of authentic populism, it\u2019s a wonder why she continues to do so.\n\nPavlich is the editor for Townhall.com and a Fox News contributor.", "description": "Throughout her entire career, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and Massachusetts Sen.
