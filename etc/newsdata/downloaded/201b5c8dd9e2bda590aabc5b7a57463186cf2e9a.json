I expect loyalty.\u201d\n\nSince assuming the presidency, Trump has expressed that need by demanding nothing short of total obedience from those serving under him, often enforcing that demand with ruthlessness.\n\nRepublican officeholders who dared criticize him have found themselves subject to blistering attacks at best, and at worst have found themselves looking for employment in the private sector. And ever since he successfully hounded Republican dissenters \u2014 even GOP stalwarts like former Senators Jeff Flake and Bob Corker, or former South Carolina Governor and Congressman Mark Sanford \u2014 out of office for apparently insufficient loyalty, Republicans in Congress have generally given up calling Trump out for his increasingly bizarre behavior.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut a gigantic crack has appeared in the president\u2019s facade of invincibility this week. A succession of witnesses parading in and out of the House Intelligence Committee's secure rooms has become a sure sign that after 998 days in office, Trump\u2019s ability to cow his executive branch subordinates into silence appears to have reached its limit.\n\nThe first sign of this came on Friday, when former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told members of Congress that Trump had ordered her recall in response to \"unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives\u201d \u2014 namely Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and two of his now-indicted associates.\n\nYovanovitch, a career foreign service officer, made her appearance on Capitol Hill just four days after White House Counsel Pat Cipollone released a dramatically worded letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her team, in which he declared that Trump \"[could not] permit his administration to participate\" in the House's impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn the days since, it has become clear that an increasing number of current and former members of his administration no longer seem to care what the White House Counsel thinks.\n\nOn Monday, Fiona Hill, formerly Trump's top Russia expert, told impeachment investigators that Trump and Giuliani had bypassed career diplomats to run a shadow foreign policy meant to personally benefit Trump. While White House lawyers tried to insist that she refrain from revealing details of communications between Trump, diplomats, and foreign leaders, her attorney responded to the White House's demands by noting that executive privilege \"disappears altogether when there is any reason to believe government misconduct occurred.\"\n\nMore administration officials are expected to give testimony in the coming days. Today, it's Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs George Kent who will speak to the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committee members and staff.\n\nOn Wednesday, they will hear testimony from Michael McKinley, the former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who resigned last week over his dismay at Pompeo\u2019s failure to support career personnel who have been caught up in the Ukraine controversy.\n\nAnd on Friday, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper is expected to appear in yet another closed session, which, according to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, is meant to keep Trump's allies from trying to get their stories straight based on public testimony.\n\nEven Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, who Trump previously blocked from appearing, is set to finally testify on Thursday.\n\nWhen I asked former Trump campaign aide Sam Nunberg why he thought people were finally coming forward, he told me he wasn't convinced that it had anything to do with weaknesses on Trump's part, stressing that his loyal supporters in Congress would continue to make objections based on the House's failure to hold a vote on its impeachment probe. Nunberg also predicted that the president's defense would focus on the fact that the military aid he is accused of holding up for political purposes was eventually released, but admitted that the number of people coming forward with information isn't a good sign.\n\n\"You can get into whether or not he was trying to hold up the aid, but at the end of the day the aid was given,\" he said. \"With that said, people are showing up and in a perfect world, it would be better for the president's defense if they didn't.\u201d\n\nOne of the House Democrats who has been involved in the investigation, Rep. Jamie Raskin, attributed the number of cooperative administration witnesses to the level of patriotism commonly found in the US civil service, and to the overall weakness of Trump's privilege claims.\n\n\"I think that witnesses are acting out of a sense of patriotic and legal duty,\" Raskin said in a text message. \"They understand that they are contributing to an essential moment in our history and they don't see any reason to face charges of contempt of Congress for a president who seems to lose cases in court on a daily basis.\"\n\nThat these career professionals and experts aren't bowing to the White House's demands also comes as no surprise to former Watergate special prosecutor Nick Akerman.\n\n\"The fact is, these people aren't beholden to Donald Trump,\" Akerman told me. \"They've been subpoenaed and that overrides Trump's counsel's statement. They have to obey the subpoena.\"\n\nAkerman explained that in his experience, career professionals have a low tolerance for shadiness: \u201dWhen Nixon tried to get the IRS to audit people on his enemies list, he got stymied because people in the civil service wouldn't go along with the craziness and illegality.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Attorney Mark Zaid said that he and other lawyers on his team are now representing the second person, who is said to work in the intelligence community and has first-hand knowledge that supports claims made by the first whistleblower and has spoken to the intelligence community's inspector general. The second whistleblower has not yet filed their own complaint, but does not need to to be considered an official whistleblower.

As Trump\u2019s personal attorney he has been trying to find compromising material about the president\u2019s enemies in Ukraine in what some have termed a \u201cshadow\u201d foreign policy. In a series of eccentric TV appearances he has claimed that the US state department asked him to get involved. Giuliani insists that he is fighting corruption on Trump\u2019s behalf and has called himself a \u201chero\u201d. AP 5/19 Volodymyr Zelensky The newly elected Ukrainian president - a former comic actor best known for playing a man who becomes president by accident - is seen frantically agreeing with Trump in the partial transcript of their July phone call released by the White House. With a Russian-backed insurgency in the east of his country, and the Crimea region seized by Vladimir Putin in 2014, Zelensky will have been eager to please his American counterpart, who had suspended vital military aid before their phone conversation. He says there was no pressure on him from Trump to do him the \u201cfavour\u201d he was asked for. Zelensky appeared at an awkward press conference with Trump in New York during the United Nations general assembly, looking particularly uncomfortable when the American suggested he take part in talks with Putin.

However, Trump announced that Pence had had \u201cone or two\u201d phone conversations of a similar nature, dragging him into the crisis. Pence himself denies any knowledge of any wrongdoing and has insisted that there is no issue with Trump\u2019s actions. It has been speculated that Trump involved Pence as an insurance policy - if both are removed from power the presidency would go to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, something no Republican would allow. AP 7/19 Rick Perry Trump reportedly told a meeting of Republicans that he made the controversial call to the Ukrainian president at the urging of his own energy secretary, Rick Perry, and that he didn\u2019t even want to. The president apparently said that Perry wanted him to talk about liquefied natural gas - although there is no mention of it in the partial transcript of the phone call released by the White House. It is thought that Perry will step down from his role at the end of the year.

Trump says that Biden pressured Ukraine to sack a prosecutor who was investigating an energy company that Biden\u2019s son Hunter was on the board of, refusing to release US aid until this was done. However, pressure to fire the prosecutor came on a wide front from western countries. It is also believed that the investigation into the company, Burisma, had long been dormant.

On September 24, amid reports of the Ukraine call and the day before the White House released a partial transcript of it, she relented and announced an inquiry, saying: \u201cThe president must be held accountable. No one is above the law.\u201d Getty 13/19 Adam Schiff Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, one of the three committees leading the inquiry.

He has also been criticised for claiming that his committee had had no contact with the whistleblower, only for it to emerge that the intelligence agent had contacted a staff member on the committee for guidance before filing the complaint.
