(STI) profit fell in its third quarter as the bank reported additional charges related to its merger with BB&T Corp.\n\nAtlanta-based SunTrust reported a third-quarter profit of $623 million, or $1.34 a share, compared with $752 million, or $1.56 a share, a year ago. Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting $1.40 a share.\n\nThe company said its earnings results include a 6 cents a share hit from impacts related to merging with BB&T Corp.\n\nTotal revenue rose about 3% to $2.35 billion. Analysts were expecting $2.34 billion.\n\nNet interest income was $1.51 billion, about flat from a year earlier. Analysts expected $1.53 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nNoninterest income rose 8% to $843 million, above the $810 million analysts had expected, driven by higher mortgage-related and investment banking income.\n\nNet interest margin, a profitability metric for banks, was 3.06%, down from 3.27% the same quarter a year earlier.\n\nWrite to Patrick Thomas at patrick.thomas@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 17, 2019 06:34 ET (10:34 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
