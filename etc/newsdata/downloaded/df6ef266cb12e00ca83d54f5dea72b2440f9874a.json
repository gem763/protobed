Turned up for the wedding but not when she\u2019s dying??,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"WHERE THE HELL IS SINEAD'S MUM? Does she only do weddings???\"\n\n\"Shouldn't Sinead's mum have rocked up to see her dying daughter by now? Or does she only appear for weddings?,\" said a fourth.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nHere is Sinead's emotional video message in full (be warned, it will leave you in tears):\n\n\"Hello Bertie. It\u2019s me, mummy. I\u2019m going to film loads of videos for your birthdays and all that. But first what I really want you to know is. I'm so so sorry I cant be with you in person. But know this. I love you very, very much. Lots and lots like jelly tots.\n\n\"I know I'm not going to be there for your first birthday. Your 18th. Your 21st and your engagement, wedding, whatever. Your first day at school. I wont get to meet your first girlfriend or boyfriend. I know that\u2019s really rubbish.\n\n\"But I want you to know ill be there in spirit. I know you can\u2019t see me. But I\u2019m there. I am. Just look around you. I'm there in the sun that pops up from behind a cloud. I'm there at the sound of the rain on the window. The crackle in a roaring fire in a country pub. and that bus that comes early.\n\n\"Be kind to people, respect women, well respect everyone really except for idiots. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t like arctic role. I wasted years of my life pretending. You never pretend about anything. You be you.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"Be nice. I know, you\u2019re probably thinking that nice is overrated. I I\u2019ve learnt one thing in my 25 years on this planet. Nice can change the world. Look for the joys. and the laughs. Life\u2019s when you\u2019re laughing.\n\n\"When I were a kid I used to love drawing but we never had much money so me mum let me draw on these big rolls of wallpaper. One day I remember I drew round myself and coloured myself in. Then I remember I put the hat on and some sunglasses and I went outside, rang the doorbell and when my mum answered I held it up in front of me and I went 'Miss Tinker you\u2019re daughter's been run over by a steam roller'. My mum went 'get in Sinead'. I couldn\u2019t stop laughing.\n\n\"Do that on your dad some time. He\u2019s alright your dad. We first met in a kebab shop. I know\u2026romantic. Ask him about it. He bought me a Venus fly trap. Only it died and\u2026\n\n\"That's the best thing that ever happened to me. You and him. Cause if there wasn\u2019t a him there wouldn\u2019t be a you would there. So be gentle with him don\u2019t you.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nCorrie viewers were in floods of tears while listening to Sinead's emotional video message to Bertie.\n\nOne viewer said: \"Lump in my throat listening to Sinead talking about everything she'll miss out on with Bertie\"\n\n\"Crying at Sinead filming video messages for her son,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"She started the video with \u201chi Bertie\u201d and I\u2019m already getting tears in my eyes\"\n\n\"Actually bawling my eyes out seeing sinead make videos for bertie,\" said a fourth.\n\n*Coronation Street airs Mondays, Wednesday and Fridays on ITV at 7.30pm and 8.30pm", "description": "Dying Sinead Tinker told her baby boy she would always be there in spirit during an emotional final message that reduced Coronation Street fans to tears", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20718673.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Coronation-Street-Sinead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
