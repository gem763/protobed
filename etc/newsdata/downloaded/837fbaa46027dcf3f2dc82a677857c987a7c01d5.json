It showed Trump, a Republican, asking Zelenskiy to investigate one of his main rivals in the 2020 election, former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nDemocrats say the call proves Trump improperly sought a foreign leader\u2019s help to smear a political opponent; Trump calls the accusations a witch hunt.\n\nSpeaking to journalists at an event at a military site near Kiev on Monday, Zelenskiy said he felt it would be wrong to share the Ukrainian summary or transcript of the call.\n\n\u201cPrior to the presidency I was never a diplomat, but I think I have had many such conversations in my life and will have many more,\u201d Zelenskiy said.\n\n\u201cThere are certain nuances and things which I think it would be incorrect, even, to publish,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked whether Kiev would open an investigation into the claims against Joe Biden and his son Hunter, per Trump\u2019s request, Zelenskiy said Kiev would not act solely on the orders of other countries.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be commanded to do anything. We are an independent country,\u201d Zelenskiy said.\n\n\u201cWe are open, we are ready to investigate (but) it has nothing to do with me. Our independent law enforcement agencies are ready to investigate any case in which the law was broken.\u201d", "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday that Kiev was unlikely to publish its version of a transcript of a July 25 phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, at the heart of an impeachment inquiry in Washington.", "authors": ["Sergiy Karazy", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
