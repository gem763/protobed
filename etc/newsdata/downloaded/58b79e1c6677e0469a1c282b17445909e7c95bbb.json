Pat Toomey and President Donald Trump. \u201cThe president\u2019s got a learning curve on this stuff,\u201d Toomey said of gun issues. | Alex Wong/Getty Images congress The Senate surrenders legislating on guns to Trump \u2018It\u2019s a shame. We used to be a separate institution.\u2019\n\nThe Senate is essentially outsourcing its legislative duties to a divided White House and the whims of President Donald Trump, as it makes its first sustained attempt at overhauling gun laws in years.\n\nIt\u2019s a clear reaction from senators being burned so often and so badly by Trump. After having tried to guess where the president might land on a given policy dispute only to see him derail their plans, this time, they\u2019re taking no chances of reliving the trauma.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cFirst time ever in history when the president sets the agenda every day when he tweets at 4 in the morning,\u201d said Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), who is retiring at the end of the year and saw his work on an immigration bill fall apart last year after Trump came out against it. \u201cPelosi will drive some trains, Mitch will drive others. And the president is going to drive ones he wants to drive.\u201d\n\nThe dynamic is a reflection not just of Trump\u2019s mercurial nature but of how sensitive the issue of gun control is. Republican senators are loath to get crosswise with conservative activists if they don\u2019t have cover from the president on proposals many have previously rejected. Even some Democrats acknowledge that if they really want to see something passed, Trump is going to have to make the first move.\n\nBut the new reality also underscores how cautious the Republican-controlled Senate is under Trump, particularly as Majority Leader Mitch McConnell looks to defend his majority and a presidential election approaches. It also reflects the slim odds that any major gun proposals ultimately will be enacted.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The GOP tried and failed to replace Obamacare, then followed up with a successful push to cut taxes.\n\nBut more recent examples show there\u2019s little use in moving ahead without an explicit OK from Trump himself. In 2018, a bipartisan group labored to reach an immigration deal; later that year, essentially the entire Senate signed off on a stopgap plan to fund the government.\n\nBoth times, senior Trump administration officials were looped in, but the president himself didn\u2019t explicitly sign off and senators proceeded with some doubt about where Trump stood. Each time, Trump kicked out the chairs from under Republicans and Democrats alike, scuttling legislation protecting young undocumented immigrants and fueling the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.\n\nWhether waiting for Trump this time is a smart idea or an outright abdication of Congress\u2019 constitutional role depends largely on partisan affiliation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Sen. McConnell\u2019s decision to make the United States Senate a wholly owned subsidiary of the Trump administration,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame. We used to be a separate institution.\u201d\n\nOthers aren\u2019t so downcast.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s got a learning curve on this stuff. He didn\u2019t grow up in West Virginia, you know, with a gun in every room of the house,\u201d said Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who is among a handful of senators in close consultation with the president. \u201cHe\u2019s processing a lot of different ideas. \u2026 It\u2019s not a terrible process.\u201d\n\nToomey said things were different in 2013 when he negotiated a background checks bill with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School because President Barack Obama already had a \u201cpredetermined position\u201d on the need to enact new gun regulations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that he would have that well-defined set of views. Whereas President Trump hasn\u2019t spent a lot of time in a legislative role,\u201d Toomey said.\n\nMcConnell established the ground rules in August after a wave of mass shootings, saying the Senate would act, but only with the president\u2019s explicit support for a proposal.\n\nSince then, the Senate\u2019s just been \u2026 waiting. No hearings, no committee markups, little floor debate and not even the sort of wide-ranging private discussions by big \u201cgangs\u201d that used to assemble in the Senate during legislative crunches.\n\nAnd as most Senate vets will tell you, those gangs rarely made law anyway \u2014 falling short in their attempts to reform immigration or reduce the deficit. And guns is such a tough political issue for Republicans that the Trump-first legislative strategy is seen as the only way forward.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so fraught, not only with the particulars of the legislation, but the politics around it. It\u2019s really complicated stuff,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.). \u201cThere was never a straight line, linear path to get to a solution on this.\u201d\n\nThe scene on Capitol Hill this week was at times absurd: Attorney General William Barr and White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland met with a host of senators about a background checks proposal. But after it leaked, the White House quickly distanced itself from the draft \u2014 even though the president had tasked them with discussing the issue. Some senators said privately that Barr was advocating for the draft plan.\n\nTrump himself acknowledged Thursday that things were \u201cgoing very slowly \u2026 because we want to make sure it\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nGiven the uncertainty, Republicans believe waiting on Trump before taking any risks on controversial legislation is \u201cbrilliant,\u201d as Isakson put it. Sitting back and waiting for a presidential endorsement might not win any awards for courage, but senior lawmakers believe the party is avoiding unnecessary heartbreak and political risk by holding back.\n\nSen. Johnny Isakson. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\n\u201cOur view on this is right,\u201d said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of Senate GOP leadership. \u201cThis does not go anywhere unless we explicitly know what the president\u2019s willing to do. And the best place to figure that out is probably not seeing how we react to trial balloons.\u201d\n\nMcConnell \u201cdrew a line and said: \u2018We\u2019ll vote on it, but it needs to be something the president will sign.\u2019 And that gives him some standing to deal with the House with some degree of clout,\u201d Isakson said.\n\nManchin, Toomey and Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), the three senators who have been talking to Trump most frequently on guns, have been upbeat and unwilling to criticize the process directly because they believe it might birth an incremental win on background checks despite the uncertain nature of the negotiations.\n\nThe three met with Barr on Wednesday and Murphy, the most liberal of the three, said he \u201ccan understand\u201d why Barr is talking to Republicans, then bringing their opinions back to Trump before making a move. Manchin, a former governor, said Trump\u2019s style is familiar to him: \u201cThat\u2019s the way things worked. It comes from the top down.\u201d\n\nBut seeing rank-and-file senators, outside advocacy groups and administration officials lobby the president every which way, while the Senate simply waits is too much for some.\n\nIn an earlier time, the Senate might have deployed its committees to move legislation or produce a working draft. But no more.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are literally waiting around for the president and he\u2019s literally waiting around to not have to say\u201d anything, said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the No. 3 Democrat. \u201cSomebody\u2019s got to say, \u2018I\u2019m doing this,\u2019 and move forward.\u201d\n\nMarianne LeVine contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s a shame.
