That differs from the upcoming 760 hp Mustang Shelby GT500, which uses a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic exclusively and isn\u2019t destined for Australian sale.\n\n\u201cThis is our answer in terms of providing our Australian customers with what they want. Mustang has had phenomenal success since we launched here and we\u2019ve had people asking for a supercharger,\u201d Ford Australia CEO Kay Hart said according to News.com.au.\n\nThe right-hand-drive R-Spec also gets an updated suspension with computer-controlled shock absorbers and adjustable stabilizer bars, plus a set of high performance Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires.\n\nFord will offer 500 of them in a choice of lime, orange white and blue for $100,000 Australian dollars, which is around $68,000.\n\nFORD ATTEMPTS TO BREAK MUSTANG PARADE RECORD WITH 1,326 CARS\n\nMost important, while you could cobble something like this together at home with parts from the Ford Performance catalog, the R-Spec comes with a 5-year factory warranty.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Thunder Down Under.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
