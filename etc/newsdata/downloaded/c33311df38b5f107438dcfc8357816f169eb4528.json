Climate Action Summit in New York where more than 60 world leaders were expected to appear, including ones from small island states most at risk from rising sea levels. Companies were expected to make fresh pledges to cut emissions of greenhouse gases at the summit.\n\nActivists targeted locations in Washington, D.C. including Farragut Square, Columbus Circle, near the Union Station train terminal and at Folger Park on Capitol Hill.\n\nJust north of the White House, at 16th Street and K Street, activists pushed a small sailboat into the middle of the intersection and chained themselves to it. Police arrived with a power saw to free the protesters, draping them with heavy blankets to protect them from flying sparks, and called a truck to haul the boat away.\n\nAbout 200 protesters chanted nearby: \u201cIt\u2019s dire, It\u2019s dire, the house is on fire!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fighting for our future because if things continue as they are with fossil fuel extractive industries... increasing greenhouse gases there\u2019s not going to be a good future for anyone,\u201d said Arielle Welch, 23, a volunteer for the Sunrise Movement, a nonprofit group.\n\nThe protest, called Shut Down DC, was backed by about two dozen groups, including the Metro D.C. chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, Extinction Rebellion D.C. and Black Lives Matter D.C.\n\nAlaina Gertz, a spokeswoman for the Washington metropolitan police department, said the arrests were made for blocking traffic.\n\nExtinction Rebellion, which says it is backed by hundreds of scientists, promotes non-violent civil disobedience to press governments to cut carbon emissions and avert a climate crisis it fears will bring starvation and social collapse.\n\nOver 11 days in April, the group disrupted parts of London, stopping trains and defacing the building of energy giant Shell.\n\nProtesters aim to pressure U.S. officials who are helping to make Washington an obstacle in international climate negotiations, said Kaela Bamberger, a spokeswoman for Extinction Rebellion, D.C.\n\nSlideshow (24 Images)\n\nPresident Donald Trump who intends to pull the United States out of the 2015 Paris accord, has rolled back Obama-era rules on emission cuts and wants to maximize U.S. energy output.\n\nMonday\u2019s protest also seeks to support the climate strikes of Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish activist who traveled to New York in a sailboat and is participating in the U.N. summit.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be here really, but I have to... I don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d said Maria, a 15-year-old high school student from Virginia who skipped school and did not want to give her last name.", "description": "Activists seeking to pressure U.S. politicians to tackle climate change blocked major traffic hubs in the U.S. capital on Monday, chaining themselves to a sailboat in the middle of a street, while police arrested 26 protesters.", "authors": ["Timothy Gardner", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432968985&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M168", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
