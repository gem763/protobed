We have different speeds, and we argue over it constantly, but it\u2019s better than feeling unheard and alone and that you have to scurry in the shadows.\u201d\n\nPausing for breath, Middleditch told Playboy, \u201cI don\u2019t know how much I can say, because I don\u2019t want my wife to be mad at me.\u201d\n\nOf course most people might assume their wives would get pretty mad if they revealed they were having sex with other people, period, but the moment of reflection passed, and Middleditch proceeded to reveal an awful lot more about how exactly their sex life works.\n\n\u201cFor anything sexual, whether in terms of the sex act or identity or kink, you want to know where the walls of the box are. Mollie and I have created our own rules and compared to most of the people we\u2019ve met who do this kind of shit, our rules are strict. We\u2019re not off on our own, we\u2019re together, a unit. It\u2019s a perpetual state of management and communication, to the point where it\u2019s like, \u2018Alright, we\u2019ve got to stop. Chill.\u2019 I\u2019m gas, and she\u2019s brakes. This is actually the premise for a comedy series we\u2019re writing together.\u201d\n\nOne wonders whether one particularly amusing scene in the new series will involve the wife clobbering the too-eager husband over the head with a famous pornographic magazine to which he has given an intensely revealing interview.\n\n\u201cI love my wife like I\u2019ve never loved anyone before,\u201d Middleditch explains. \u201cWith two people who feel that way about each other, how do you go down that road? It\u2019s tough. Bring a therapist along for the ride.\u201d\n\nHang on, are they sleeping with their therapist as well?\n\nWhile the rest of us might get into domestic arguments about whose turn it is to do the washing up, or what to watch on TV, the Middleditches have equally profound disagreements, although in their case it\u2019s more likely to be about whether to invite his fans into the bedroom or not. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the trickier elements of it all, because Mollie doesn\u2019t get that and yet she has to witness it. I\u2019m like, \u2018Come on, what about this chick who\u2019s obviously really into me?\u2019 And Mollie will say, \u2018Yeah, she\u2019s into you. Where do I fit in?\u2019 That question comes up. There\u2019s a lot of negotiation, fame sometimes makes it easier and sometimes complicates things.\u201d\n\nPresumably he means that the main thing fame makes easier is sourcing hot female fans ready to hop into bed with him and his wife.\n\nOne thing he does not like is social media-sourced hook ups: \"Instagram fucks up marriages. If your partner brings this very forward person from Instagram to you, you\u2019ll be like, \u201cDo you guys have a thing?\u201d Whereas if your partner bumps into someone and they start a conversation, it all happens in front of you. It\u2019s a game of inches on a minefield to try to predict who\u2019s going to feel safe.\"\n\nAnd for everyone who thinks Middleditch is a selfish asshole exploiting his fame and his wife for his own sexual satisfaction, Middleditch is insistent that is absolutely not the case: \u201cAnything that happens has to be run by the queen,\u201d he says, adding, \u201cMy first concern is Mollie.\u201d\n\nOK, buddy.
