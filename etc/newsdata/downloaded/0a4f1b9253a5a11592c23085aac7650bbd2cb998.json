Nearly a decade after the spill, more than 50 coal ash spill cleanup workers and deceased workers\u2019 survivors are suing Jacobs Engineering for unsafe working conditions. Satterfield, who has more than 28 years of experience covering law and crime, wrote a series of stories as part of her special report on the dangers the coal ash workers faced at the site and the lawsuit they brought in 2018.\n\nThe 66th Scripps Howard Awards contest honored the best in American journalism from the past year in 15 categories. Results were judged by veteran journalists and media industry leaders at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies in St. Petersburg, Florida. Satterfield, who has more than 28 years of experience covering law and crime, will be presented with her award in April 18 in Cincinnati at a ceremony that will be livestreamed on YouTube and Facebook. She will receive a $10,000 prize along with winners of other categories.\n\n\"Reporter Jamie Satterfield delivers excellent watchdog work that truly holds the powerful accountable. Her investigation is deeply reported and swarms all the important angles. The series of stories were well sourced and contained videos with on-the-record accounts that hit viewers between the eyes. Satterfield's extraordinary efforts result in change-inducing and life-saving journalism,\u201d said the judges of Satterfield\u2019s win.\n\n\"We're so proud of Jamie's relentless reporting on a topic of such vital interest to East Tennessee and beyond,\" said Joel Christopher, Knoxville News Sentinel executive editor. \"Strong local journalism provides an irreplaceable safeguard for the health and welfare of our communities.\"\n\n\u201cReporters like Jamie are why local journalism matters. She digs and doesn\u2019t give up until she has the truth,\" said Michael Anastasi, vice president of news for USA TODAY NETWORK-Tennessee. \"As a result, Tennesseans know the inside story about how the nation\u2019s largest public utility treated workers in the aftermath of one of the worst environmental disasters in the country.\u201d\n\nSatterfield was named the winner among finalists in the community journalism category that included The Tennessean, which is also part of the USA TODAY NETWORK. The Tennessean was nominated for its \u201cSafekeepers\u201d investigation, which dealt with the practice of holding pre-trial defendants, including many teenagers, in solitary confinement. In May, then-Gov. Bill Haslam signed a bill establishing more oversight and forbidding the holding of juvenile safekeepers in adult prisons.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/pr/2019/03/06/knoxville-news-sentinel-reporter-wins-scripps-howard-award-community-journalism/3085076002/", "description": "Investigative journalist Jamie Satterfield won a Scripps Howard Award for her coal ash stories.", "authors": ["Staff", "Usa Today Network Pressroom", "Published P.M.
