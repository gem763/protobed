However, such an approach to the protection of users\u2019 digital assets harbors certain risks. The point is that private keys can easily be forgotten, lost when written on a paper, or stolen from a computer or mobile device in the course of a hacking attack. That\u2019s why it is essential to apply custodian solutions to avoid potential risks of theft and fraudulent activities.\n\nSwipe \u2014 a cryptocurrency wallet system, which comes in a form of both a digital multi-asset wallet and a Visa debit card \u2014 has announced the establishment of a strategic relationship with Coinbase to provide custody solutions for its clients. The company says that its users can expect their digital assets to be safe and secure because all the deposits made into the Swipe wallet app will be stored with Coinbase Custody.\n\nUser benefits from partnership\n\nCoinbase Custody is a qualified third-party custodian licensed as a fiduciary under banking laws in the state of New York State. Swipe says it offers its clients an institutional-grade offline storage solution that has been used by Coinbase as a native custodian solution since 2012.\n\nThe company reports that Coinbase Custody was developed with the intention to address the unique challenges of storing crypto assets. Meanwhile, it operates similarly to traditional custodial services being overseen by the same regulators, held to the same capital requirements, and even audited in the same way as traditional financial custodians.\n\nAs hacking attacks in the cryptosphere are mostly irreversible, professional investors opt for storing their assets in the cold storage with insurance from a company with a strong reputation. That\u2019s why, as Swipe emphasizes, the opportunity to store digital assets in its wallet system with Coinbase Custody will provide long-term stability and enhance the monetary security of the user\u2019s financial assets.\n\nAs Swipe reports, the digital assets stored with Coinbase Custody will be segregated and held in a trust. The company also plans to utilize Coinbase for swift crypto-to-fiat conversions \u2014 whether the transactions are performed using the Swipe Card or Swipe Wallet application. This will give users instant access to payments in more than 20 supported cryptocurrencies at over 40 million locations worldwide, wherever Visa is accepted. Being able to easily spend crypto tokens \u2014 for example, on a cup of coffee \u2014 can be another big step toward mass adoption.\n\nSwipe is available here\n\nJoselito Lizarondo, CEO of Swipe, points out the significance of instant payments in cryptocurrencies: \u201cOur new strategic relationship with Coinbase will bring a safe, secure, and insured custody solution for all deposits from the Swipe Wallet held with Coinbase. With the help of Coinbase we will also be able to provide real-time crypto conversions for our users utilizing our Swipe Card and Swipe Wallet. Enabling these features will bring crypto to traditional payment methods and we are excited for all of our European users.\u201d\n\nPlans for the future\n\nThe Swipe digital wallet is currently available for download on both the App Store and Google Play. It is powered by the native SXP token and supports more than 20 various cryptocurrencies. The company says its users are able to buy, sell and pay with their cryptocurrencies, as well as make instant exchanges between all supported assets.\n\nSwipe is headquartered in London, with offices located in the United States, Estonia and the Philippines. Right now, the Swipe Wallet application is available worldwide except for the U.S., as well as some Eastern European, Asian and African countries.\n\nIn the immediate future, Swipe is planning to offer its financial services in the U.S. and the Philippines after appropriate licensing and registrations are complete. The Swipe Card, currently available for order in Visa Europe countries, is going to be launched soon in the U.S. as well as Asian-Pacific countries. Moreover, Swipe intends to offer Swipe Credit Cards and real-time cryptocurrency credit lines in its crypto wallet.\n\nAll in all, as the company highlights, by providing users with a trusted custodian solution, it plans to secure their assets and allow instant payments in cryptocurrencies. As a result, this will make the crypto space more regulatory-compliant and the imminent mass adoption of cryptocurrency possible.\n\nLearn more about Swipe", "description": "A multi-asset wallet announces a new partnership and introduces new custodian solutions for its customers", "authors": ["Viktoria Moore"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvYjlhNzdkZmZiYTM2OGQ2ODg3YjkyNzNkYzI5NzAxNjEuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
