Although Abiy blamed METEC for problems last year, he did not say how long a delay they had caused.\n\nThe dam was initially supposed to have been finished in 2018, but an initial two turbines are now due to start generating 750 megawatts each in December 2020.\n\nThe entire dam is due to be completed by 2022, Ethiopia\u2019s water minister, Seleshi Bekele, said last week.\n\nThe hydropower dam on the Nile River is located 500 km (311 miles) northwest of the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, near the border with Sudan.", "description": "Construction of a $4-billion dam at the heart of Ethiopia's bid to become Africa's biggest power exporter has been delayed five years as engineers had to replace shoddy work by a conglomerate pulled off the job last year, a project official said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435857842&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902M4-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
