Something about an LNG [liquefied natural gas] plant.\"\n\nFollowing Axios' report, Perry acknowledged that he \"absolutely\" encouraged the president to call Zelensky \"multiple times,\" but not about the Bidens.\n\nIn the House Democrats' letter subpoenaing Perry, the chairs of the House Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs committees wrote that Axios' report \"raised significant questions about your efforts to press Ukrainian officials to change the management structure at a Ukrainian state-owned energy company.\"\n\nOn October 7, House Democrats issued a subpoena to Russell Vought, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, for documents pertaining to reports that Trump had asked former OMB Director Mick Mulvaney to withhold the already-appropriated aid to Ukraine.\n\nAnd on September 27, the same House Committee chairs issued a subpoena to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was revealed by the Wall Street Journal to have been on the call after denying it in an interview with ABC.\n\nIn addition to misrepresenting his involvement in the Trump-Zelensky call, Pompeo is also accused of obstructing the congressional investigation into the matter by refusing to comply with the House's subpoenas.\n\nRead more: Mike Pompeo made at least 4 significantly misleading statements about his role in the Trump-Ukraine phone call\n\nIn September, Pompeo sent a letter to the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight committees, telling them their requests to depose department officials connected to the whistleblower's complaint are \"not feasible\" and \"do not provide adequate time for the Department and its employees to prepare\" for testimony.\n\nIn turn, Democratic lawmakers accused Pompeo of \"intimidating Department witnesses\" from testifying and warned that it \"will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry.\"", "description": "Previously, House Democrats have subpoenaed acting OMB Director Russel Vought and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.", "authors": ["Grace Panetta"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/58810005ee14b6b2008b8d87?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
