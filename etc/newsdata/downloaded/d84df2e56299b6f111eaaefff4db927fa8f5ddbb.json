Early snapshots show Meghan and Prince Harry beaming past their small army of guards as they exit their car (not stooping so low as to shut their own doors, thank God!). She put her hair up in the type of perfect regal bun that is usually only reserved for stock photos of princesses.\n\nThe new mother had her first big mommy\u2019s night out (or should we say mummy\u2019s, because England), in a truly fabulous blouson-style top adorned with shiny rhinestones. The Daily Mail dutifully reported the dress as a Valentino tulle number costing $13,500. (\u201cUnfortunately, it's currently sold out.\u201d)\n\nBummer, as the gown boasts what has become the calling card sleeve of the 1 percent: the dress has big arms so dramatic, they inhibit the wearer from doing just about anything. Because that is what assistants are for, of course.\n\nIvanka, attempting to manifest princessdom herself so doggedly she risks turning into a pumpkin at midnight, opted for her usual over-the-top, not-how-any-human-should-ever-dress aesthetic of a sweeping peach chiffon gown, complete with cape. With her newly short hair in tight curls, it\u2019s pure Barbara Stanwyck, with a hearty dose of American tourist hubris.\n\nAlso, with bits of material flying and flowing this way and that, it is a potential health hazard for wearer and passerby alike.\n\nThe look may have revived Edith Wharton, dead over 80 years, to write a bitchy book about the two women exchanging cold stares across tables crammed with freesia bouquets, carbonara, and chianti.\n\nMeghan and Ivanka were once close enough to be on speaking terms\u2014or, perhaps more accurately, both had assistants who swapped email addresses. In 2014, when a Trump presidency was just a glint in Roger Stone\u2019s eyes and Meghan was but a humble working television actress, the now-duchess interviewed Ivanka for a post on her blog, called The Tig.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a moment and discuss Ivanka Trump,\u201d Meghan wrote, unaware that a torrent of think pieces would borrow that phrase just a few years later. \u201cStaggering beautiful, no question, but so incredibly savvy and intelligent that she\u2019s not just carved a niche for herself under her father\u2019s famed Trump notoriety, she has undoubtedly created her own empire.\u201d\n\nMeghan even commended Ivanka for never stopping so low as to \u201cdance on tables or release a pop album\u201d during her teenage heiress days. (A diplomatic dig to Paris Hilton, perhaps, who released Stars Are Blind, a very underrated album chock full of very danceable singles, thank you very much!)\n\nShe went on to compliment Ivanka\u2019s jewelry collection, rave about the entrepreneur's \u201chonest\u201d responses to the interview questions she passed along about work and motherhood, and revealed that the two had made plans to get drinks and dinner \u201cthe next time I am in NY.\u201d\n\n\u201c The liberal-leaning Meghan does not want to be seen with Ivanka. But friendship\u2014and being British, which Meghan is now\u2014means grinning and bearing it and showing up to the wedding. So here they all are \u201d\n\nNow they are both in Rome, about to share a dinner, but things have changed. Meghan was a vocal Trump critic before her Duchess days left her unable to comment on politics, and because of that, Ivanka\u2019s father called her \u201cnasty\u201d before his visit to the UK.\n\nAlong with that, optics-wise, the liberal-leaning Meghan does not want to be seen with Ivanka. But friendship\u2014and being British, which Meghan is now\u2014means grinning and bearing it and showing up to the wedding. So here they all are.\n\nAlso, Katy Perry is there, too. She showed up in a ruffled pink gown, like a sentient lawn flamingo. She brought her longtime beau Orlando Bloom as a plus one, and we love him because he had the best time palling around with friends at Nonoo\u2019s rehearsal dinner.\n\nThings were decidedly less star-studded at Misha Nonoo\u2019s pop-up store in SoHo today. When this writer hopefully asked the staff if they would serve any champagne in the designer\u2019s honor, a saleswoman said, \u201cNo, but we should\u201d with a smile.\n\nStaff at the pop-up store felt jubilant enough to suggest this writer try on \u201cThe Husband\u201d white button-up, currently on sale for $185.\n\nIt\u2019s none other than the same style Meghan wore during her first photographed date with Prince Harry in 2017. It looks like any other oversized business shirt a brand sells, except it closes with tiny little metal button fasteners that might give you arthritis.\n\nYou can tell a lot about a woman\u2019s designer based on what they chose to call their bulky tops. The standard (heteronormative) descriptor is \u201cboyfriend.\u201d Edgier labels go with \u201cex-boyfriend.\u201d Nonoo sweetly chose \u201chusband,\u201d because that\u2019s what Meghan Markle has now!\n\nNonoo\u2019s very bright, airy, agreeable store comes blazoned with popular feminist slogans on the walls aimed to please the pink pussy hat set.\n\nThere\u2019s \u201cWhat\u2019s a Girl\u2019s Favorite Position? CEO,\u201d and in case you didn't catch that double entendre, you can also get smacked in the face with another: \u201cA Woman\u2019s Place is in the Boardroom.\u201d\n\n\u201c Maybe the vaguely political, \u2018If you are more fortunate than others, build a longer table, not a taller fence,\u2019 is a coded message for Ivanka to pass along to her dad. \u201d\n\nThen, the wall's copywriter/designer got bored and went with some platitudes like \u201cEmpowered women, empower women\u201d and \u201cKnow your worth then add tax.\u201d\n\nMaybe the vaguely political, \u201cIf you are more fortunate than others, build a longer table, not a taller fence,\u201d is a coded message for Ivanka to pass along to her dad.\n\nNonoo traffics a sort of easily digestible feminism aimed to \u201cempower\u201d women who can afford $70 tank tops.\n\nBut Nonoo, who last week told The New York Times she and Meghan share a \u201cpassion for equality,\u201d seems to be trying to do something with her privilege. Meghan tapped the designer to help with her capsule collection for SmartWorks charity, and for every piece of the workwear line that is sold in store, one will be donated to an unemployed woman currently job-hunting.\n\nMy editor, Tim Teeman, dubbed the Nonoo aesthetic \u201cMeg-vanka\u201d: social justice twinged with comfortable, who-could-dissent? statements about \u201cbeing a boss.\u201d Currently, Meghan's embrace of feminism seems more active and committed than Ivanka\u2019s; and Donald Trump's antipathy towards Meghan likely means the women will not be photographed together in Italy. (Will they speak? Will we know?)\n\nFor now, for one night, Meghan and Ivanka must do the balletic dance of avoiding photo ops, while mingling with other privileged members of the glitterati.
