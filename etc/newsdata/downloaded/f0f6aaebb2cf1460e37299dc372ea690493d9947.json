But Dallas police said Tuesday that it was actually part of a drug deal gone wrong, and they\u2019ve identified three suspects.\n\nJoshua Brown was fatally shot multiple times as he was getting out of his car in the parking lot near his apartment Friday night, two weeks after he\u2019d testified at Guyger\u2019s trial. Brown lived in the same Dallas apartment building as Guyger and Botham Jean, the man she murdered, in September 2018. But it was a different apartment complex, about six miles away, where Brown was shot last week. Witnesses described a silver sedan speeding away. Brown died at a nearby hospital.\n\nHis death poured salt in a wound that\u2019s still very fresh for Dallas\u2019 black residents \u2014 Guyger was white, Jean was black \u2014 and left some people speculating Brown\u2019s death was in retaliation for his testimony in the highly watched trial last month. Lee Merritt, a lawyer working with his family, said Brown\u2019s death was \u201csuspicious.\u201d\n\n\u201cI assure you that is simply not true,\u201d Dallas Deputy Chief Avery Moore said of the retaliation rumors during a press conference Tuesday.\n\nPolice said that they seized 12 pounds of marijuana from Brown\u2019s apartment and have since issued arrest warrants to try to nab two Louisiana-based suspects \u2014 Thaddeous Green, 22, and Michael Mitchell, 32 \u2014 for his suspected murder. Police believe Brown, who also had a gun that night and allegedly shot first, was distributing the drugs.\n\nThe men allegedly drove from Alexandria, Louisiana, to buy drugs from Brown. A \u201cphysical altercation\u201d ensued after Green began talking to Brown, according to Moore.\n\nDallas police already arrested Jacquerious Mitchell, a 20-year-old who was at the scene that night, Moore said.\n\nAt Guyger\u2019s trial in late September, Brown testified that he heard gunshots one night outside his apartment unit and witnessed Guyger pacing and crying on the phone. Guyger, a veteran of the city\u2019s police force, had just mistakenly walked into Jean\u2019s apartment, apparently thinking it was her own, and taken him for an intruder. She pulled out her gun, allegedly commanded that Jean put his hands in the air, and shot him. Brown lived just across the hall at the time, and testified that he\u2019d heard no such commands \u2014 just gunshots.\n\nLast week, Guyger was sentenced to 10 years in prison for murder.\n\nBrown had been shot another time, in November 2018, a month after Jean\u2019s death, as the result of a fight outside a local strip club. Another man was killed in that attack.\n\nCover: In this Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2019, photo, victim Botham Jean's former neighbor Joshua Brown, left, answers questions from Assistant District Attorney LaQuita Long, right, while pointing to a map of the South Side Flats where he lived at the time, while testifying during the murder trial of former Dallas Police Officer Amber Guyger, in Dallas.
