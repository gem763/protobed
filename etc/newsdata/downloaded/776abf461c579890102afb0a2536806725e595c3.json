The rest of the 46 percent who voted for Trump have real doubts about who he is, how he behaves and what he is doing to our country. Even those of us who disagree with them on a variety of issues see this substantial part of Trump\u2019s constituency as made up of rational and engaged citizens open to persuasion.\n\nAD\n\nPolls conducted throughout Trump\u2019s presidency show that his critics feel far more strongly about their opposition to him than his defenders feel about their support. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted between Sept. 30 and Oct. 1, found that only 24 percent of registered voters strongly approved of Trump\u2019s performance, while 44 percent strongly disapproved. Significantly, 74 percent of Democratic registered voters strongly disapproved of Trump, but only 50 percent of Republican registered voters strongly approved of him. Which base would you rather have going into this fight \u2014 and into 2020?\n\nThe 24 percent are the folks you see at the Trump rallies. Trump\u2019s more tepid approvers (17 percent of registered voters in this survey) tend to stay home, take in the news and ask questions about what\u2019s going on.\n\nAD\n\nThe big gap between strong approvers and strong disapprovers was very predictive of the 2018 election turnout that gave Democrats control of the House. Those elections showed that many who voted for Trump in 2016 were prepared to vote for Democrats two years later. This was a telling sign that a sizable share of Trump\u2019s voters are not lockstep apologists.\n\nAD\n\nRecall that the three key Trump states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin elected Democratic senators and governors last year. In Wisconsin, Sen. Tammy Baldwin picked up 14 percent of Trump\u2019s 2016 voters, while Sen. Bob Casey won 12 percent of them in Pennsylvania and Sen. Debbie Stabenow got 9 percent of them in Michigan. If a Democratic presidential nominee can achieve those numbers next year, Trump loses.\n\nMoreover, a stack of surveys shows that while Trump has maintained a fairly steady overall approval rating in the low 40s, the proportion of Americans who actually like and trust him is much lower.\n\nAD\n\nAn NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll conducted Sept. 13 to 16, before the White House readout of Trump\u2019s Ukraine call was released, found a relatively high 45 percent saying they approved of Trump\u2019s performance. But only 30 percent said they had \u201cvery positive\u201d feelings toward him, and only 25 percent said they both liked Trump personally and approved of most of his policies.\n\nAD\n\nA CNN poll conducted Sept. 5 to 9 found Trump with a 39 percent approval rating, but only 9 percent of the same sample said they trusted \u201calmost all\u201d of what they heard in White House communications, while 19 percent said they trusted \u201cmost of it.\u201d Again, less than 30 percent have confidence in the stories the White House tells.\n\nThe bottom line is that too much political analysis (wrongly) sees this hard core as representing all of those who backed Trump in 2016 because they wanted to send one message or another (or because they loathed Hillary Clinton). In fact, a lot of Trump\u2019s one-time supporters do not believe everything they hear from him or Fox News. A fair number of them don\u2019t like him very much. Economically minded working-class Trump voters will notice that his signature promise to restore manufacturing is being broken before their eyes as new economic numbers point toward a manufacturing recession.\n\nAD\n\nThose advancing the case for impeachment believe that, whether the Senate removes Trump from office or not, it\u2019s important to make clear how corrupt and dangerous his behavior has been. More Trump voters are listening to these arguments than their pretend-friends want us to believe.\n\nAD\n\nRead more from E.J.
