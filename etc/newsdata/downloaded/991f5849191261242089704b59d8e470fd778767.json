Musk named Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa as Starship\u2019s first private passenger in 2018.\n\nThe Boca Chica village, a few miles north of the Mexican border, is ground zero for SpaceX\u2019s three-year experimental test program for Starship, whose rocket engine tests have rattled the nerves of residents living in a remote hamlet of roughly two dozen homes a mile away.\n\n\u201cI think the actual danger to the Boca Chica village is low but it\u2019s not tiny,\u201d Musk said during a question and answer session. \u201cSo probably over time it\u2019d be better to buy out the villages, and we\u2019ve made an offer to that effect.\u201d\n\nSome residents have rejected SpaceX\u2019s non-negotiable offer to buyout their homes for three times the market value.\n\nA three-legged prototype of the rocket named Starhopper has test launched in the village twice since July, most recently flying as high as 500 feet (152 meters) and landing on an adjacent slab of concrete to trial Musk\u2019s next generation rocket engine dubbed Raptor.\n\nMusk\u2019s mission to the moon aligns with NASA\u2019s goal of sending humans there by 2024 under its Artemis program, an accelerated deep-space initiative spurred by the Trump administration in March that aims to work with a handful of U.S. space companies in building a long-term presence on the lunar surface before eventually colonizing Mars.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nThe space agency has tapped SpaceX to figure out how to land vehicles on the lunar surface and help develop a system for refueling rockets \u2014 like Starship \u2014 in space, an \u201cimportant technology to aid sustained exploration efforts on the Moon and Mars,\u201d NASA said in a release on Friday.\n\nNASA has awarded SpaceX and Boeing Co (BA.N) a total of $6.8 billion to build competing rocket and capsule systems to launch astronauts into orbit from American soil for the first time since 2011. Development of both astronaut capsules have been beset by delays and testing mishaps.\n\n\u201cI am looking forward to the SpaceX announcement tomorrow. In the meantime, Commercial Crew is years behind schedule,\u201d NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a Friday night statement. \u201cNASA expects to see the same level of enthusiasm focused on the investments of the American taxpayer. It\u2019s time to deliver.\u201d", "description": "Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has unveiled the latest iteration of his space company's newly assembled Starship, outlining a speedy development timeline for the centerpiece vehicle of SpaceX\u2019s quest to launch humans to the moon and Mars.", "authors": ["Joey Roulette", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435252126&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S0ON", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
