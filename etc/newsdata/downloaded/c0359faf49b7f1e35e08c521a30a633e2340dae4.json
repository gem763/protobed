Early on we got to bare witness to a woman seeing her reflection for the first time and not realising that she was, in fact, staring at herself. However, this particularly noteworthy scene was overshadowed by Scarlett, who emerged from upstairs all teary-eyed over what she\u2019d just seen.\n\nAll in all, the Moffatts come across pretty self-centred. For example, Scarlett, 29, saw the programme as an opportunity to bravely open up about her body confidence issues, admitting that she hasn\u2019t seen herself naked in a mirror since she was 18. Scarlett\u2019s uneasiness then became a major narrative within the episode, with the female members of the tribe requesting that she dressed in their traditional clothes \u2013 which involved showing off her breasts.\n\nThe series starts tonight (Picture: Channel 4)\n\n\u2018Even when I was slim, I looked in the mirror and saw someone that I didn\u2019t like,\u2019 Scarlett told the camera. \u2018I\u2019m really envious of the fact they can walk around with it all hanging out.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPower to Scarlett for being so frank, but surely the nature of the series was to delve deep into the cultural differences between two different groups of people?\n\nKey moments:\n\nScarlett getting real about her body confidence issues and reservations about wearing the tribe\u2019s traditional dress\n\nA female tribe member seeing her reflection for the first time\n\nScarlett going to collect water and coming across a snake\n\nMark showing the men how to use a metal detector\n\nVerdict:\n\nScarlett\u2019s misgivings were brought into conversation time and time and again and it seemed as though she was more interested in grappling with them, rather than using her time and platform to create a piece of television that could stimulate some sort of important anthropological conversation.\n\nPerhaps we expected too much.\n\nDefinitely tune in if you want to watch something through gritted teeth.\n\nThe British Tribe Next Door airs tonight at 9.15pm on Channel 4.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
