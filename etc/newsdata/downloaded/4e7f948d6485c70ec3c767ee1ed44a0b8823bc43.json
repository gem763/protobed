If people knew how much energy [and] effort and emotions are put into this case [they] would not really speak [on] what they are talking about. I've had two serious briefs with the national head of prosecutions. I have briefed her twice about the case.\"\n\nWhile not giving any indication at what stage the case was after all these years, Cele claimed it would be solved.\n\n\"What I will do this time is stand by [the fact] that the case will be solved.\"\n\nHe said he had previously met with the Meyiwa family in April.\n\n\"[Sam] had cried about the matter. It is a matter we understand. No matter what you think about it, you cannot say nothing is being done. What makes this [case] difficult is maybe a story we will tell one day. For now, our focus is for the case to be solved.\"\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android or iPhone.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "\"There is good progress in the case.\" This was as much as Police Minister Bheki Cele was willing to divulge nearly five years after the murder of Bafana Bafana and Orlando Pirates goalkeeper Senzo Meyiwa.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7368/7ab293699513427f81a28043c34d8472.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-30"}
