Reminder: There are 117 days until the Iowa caucuses and 391 days until the 2020 election.\n\nAlmost exactly one year ago, Sen. Elizabeth Warren faced the first big test of her campaign: how to address skepticism \u2014 and, from President Trump, mockery \u2014 about her long-standing claims of Native American heritage.\n\nIt was a test that pretty much everyone, including Warren herself, agrees that she failed. Her candidacy almost didn\u2019t recover.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Massachusetts senator faced the second big test of her campaign \u2014 and this time she took a different approach that seems to be working better. The shift suggests that Warren, despite lingering doubts about her \u201celectability,\u201d has finally learned how to handle the increased scrutiny that her steady rise in the polls will attract \u2014 a development that could ease fears among Democrats about how she might stack up against Trump. (She now leads Joe Biden \u2014 whose campaign has sometimes seemed at a loss over how to confront Trump\u2019s attacks \u2014 for the first time in the Democratic primary polls.)\n\nThe second controversy had the potential to damage Warren if only because it was so similar to the first. On Monday, the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative newspaper, published a report intended to cast doubt on a central chapter in the story Warren tells about herself on the stump (and in her 2014 memoir, \u201cA Fighting Chance\u201d).\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Houston in 1970 with a degree in speech pathology and audiology, Warren moved to New Jersey with her then-husband, Jim. She was subsequently hired as a speech therapist by the Riverdale school board. One year later, she says, she was let go.\n\n\u201cBy the end of the school year, I was pretty obviously pregnant,\u201d Warren writes in her book. \u201cThe principal did what I think a lot of principals did back then \u2014 wished me good luck, didn\u2019t ask me back for the next school year, and hired someone else for the job.\u201d\n\nAccording to Warren, it was a pivotal moment for her \u2014 one that set her on the path to law school, academia and eventually public service. The Free Beacon, however, found minutes of an April 21, 1971, meeting showing that the school board had approved a second-year teaching contract for Warren \u2014 and minutes from a separate board meeting two months later noting that her resignation had been \u201caccepted with regret.\u201d\n\nOthers quickly piled on, pointing to a 2007 interview in which Warren didn\u2019t mention being let go by the principal, recalling instead that she \u201cwent back to graduate school and took a couple of courses in education and said, \u2018I don\u2019t think this is going to work out for me,\u2019\u201d then ultimately \u201chad a baby and stayed home for a couple of years.\u201d CBS News, meanwhile, dug up contemporaneous newspaper clips reporting that Warren was \u201cleaving to raise a family\u201d and had \u201cresigned for personal reasons.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Ringo H.W. Chiu/AP More\n\nAccording to Warren\u2019s critics on both the right and the left, this was all part of a pattern \u2014 bending the truth to make her life story sound a little better, a little sharper, a little more dramatic.\n\nExcept that, as Warren quickly pointed out in her response, it wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe senator\u2019s initial reaction was mild. \u201cAfter becoming a public figure I opened up more about different pieces in my life,\u201d she said when CBS News asked why her account had \u201cchanged. \u201cAnd this was one of them.\u201d\n\nBut on Tuesday she came out swinging.", "description": "The senator\u2019s initial reaction was mild.", "authors": ["Andrew Romano", "West Coast Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.LMX42bz5vCvLdxWflF7cA--~B/aD0yODA0O3c9NDgwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/3798b620-eaa1-11e9-bde7-3d33cdb76646", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
