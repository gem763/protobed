(AP) \u2014 About 250 pigs have been causing a ruckus in a Vermont town the past month after they escaped from their enclosure, but most of them had been returned as of Thursday thanks in part to a trail of hot dog buns and good ol\u2019 fashioned corralling.\n\nSeveral farm workers and a couple of volunteers who heard about the loose pigs trudged up and down the dirt road hill Thursday trying to drive any pigs back into the Sugar Mountain Farm in Orange. They chased the animals into the brush, and ditches, working together to position themselves so that they could corral the large sows and boars, which frequently got away.\n\nBut farmer Walter Jeffries said most of his pigs have returned home.\n\n\u201cThe pigs have been allowed and remain to be allowed in the town right of way so cars are unable to pass, people can\u2019t walk on the road because the pigs chase them,\u201d said Town Clerk Angela Eastman on Thursday.\n\nJeffries faces tens of thousands of dollars in fines from the town for the pigs that have been spotted on and alongside the town road for weeks, creating a nuisance for drivers and pedestrians, according to the town.\n\nAP Photo/Lisa Rathke An escaped pig standing in the road.\n\nJeffries said he believes the fence enclosure was damaged by vandalism on the night of Aug. 11, allowing about 50 adult pigs and 200 piglets to escape. He thinks it was the work of a former employee and said he reported it to the police. The farm was also robbed recently of thousands of dollars in tools, he said.\n\nJeffries said his outdoor farm manager then got injured and wasn\u2019t able to repair the fencing.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve been dealing with that ever since,\u201d he said Thursday, adding that about 99% of the pigs were back and the fence had been fixed.\n\nEarlier in the day, Eastman said she spotted 16 pigs in the town right of way. A town official checks daily, counting and taking photos of the animals. The fine is based on the number of pigs in the right-of way. As of Thursday the town tallied $81,955, Eastman said.\n\n\u201cIt is a public hazard,\u201d she said of the pigs.\n\nThe pigs also got loose last year, she said.\n\nThe Vermont Agency of Agriculture is working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services to determine how much time is appropriate for the farmer to recover the animals before officials take any action, said agency spokesman Scott Waterman.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Anson Tebbetts told NECN that his agency is concerned about public safety as well as creating a feral population of pigs, which can be destructive to property.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure travelers don\u2019t run into the animals \u2014 hurt the animals, or hurt themselves,\u201d he told NECN.", "description": "The pigs caused around $80,000 of damage to the small town of Orange, Vermont before most were corralled back to Sugar Mountain Farm.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6ae007250000ad0000deb2.jpeg?cache=k2roxqj7xg&ops=1778_1000"}
