REUTERS/Mohsin Raza/File Photo\n\nThe pact will introduce visa-free access from India to the Pakistani town of Kartarpur, home to a temple that marks the site where the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak, died.\n\n\u201cToday is a day of celebration,\u201d Pakistani foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Faisal told a signing ceremony in Kartarpur.\n\nPrime Minister Imran Khan will formally open the border to pilgrims on Nov. 9, said Faisal, who signed the agreement on behalf of Pakistan with an Indian official.\n\n\u201cIt was very, very difficult and tough negotiations with India, because of the history we have, it is never easy, it is never simple,\u201d Faisal said.\n\nThe Sikh minority in India has long sought easier access to the temple, which is just over the border in Muslim-majority Pakistan.\n\nThe pact comes at a time of considerable tension between the rivals, with Pakistan particularly aggrieved over recent Indian government measures in its part of the divided Muslim-majority region of Kashmir.\n\nClashes have erupted regularly over their disputed border in Kashmir with several people killed on both sides in shelling over the weekend.\n\nThe inauguration of the crossing point comes just before the 550th birthday of Sikhism\u2019s founder on Nov. 12.\n\nThe shrine is about 4 km (2-1/2 miles) from the border. The crossing and corridor - including a road, bridge over the Ravi River and immigration office - will replace a drawn-out visa process and circuitous journey through Pakistan.\n\nBut there has been Indian opposition to a sum of $20 that Pakistan will charge each visitor.\n\nFaisal said the $20 was a service charge, not a fee, and pilgrims would just have to present their passports, which would be quickly scanned, to cross in.", "description": "India and Pakistan signed an agreement on Thursday allowing Indian pilgrims to cross the border to a Sikh shrine in Pakistan, rare cooperation between the nuclear-armed rivals at a time of tension and clashes elsewhere on their frontier.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444437681&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0NR", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
