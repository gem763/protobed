It\u2019s been fascinating to watch the discussion around the movie shift from \u201cDo we really need another Joker story so soon after Suicide Squad?\u201d to \u201cIs Joker full of dangerous ideas that will spur its worst fans to murder?\u201d The initial worries around Joker assumed the movie would be unnecessary, its impact negligible. The current questions ascribe it with too much importance, as if it might incite full-blown anarchy just by existing.\n\nAs usual in a case where people leap to extremes, the truth is somewhere in the middle. Joker may make some people who feel marginalized feel more seen and more powerful, and they may act out in response. There are some ugly, self-serving messages in the movie, which is incongruously bent on creating sympathy for Batman\u2019s worst enemy and one of DC Comics\u2019 most notoriously callous mass murderers and atrocity architects. But love it or hate it, the film does spin up a tempting fantasy of persecution and relief, of embracing nihilism as a means of complete escape from a terrible world.\n\nIt\u2019s a self-pitying fantasy, certainly. Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver follow in the footsteps of Joel Schumacher\u2019s 1993 drama Falling Down in portraying the world as a cartoonishly dark and uncaring place, an almost comically vile carnival where the protagonist can\u2019t find a hint of comfort or relief. In a thoroughly immersed performance that\u2019s being seen as a guaranteed awards-season attention magnet, Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a part-time rent-a-clown working for a seedy talent agency full of exaggerated grotesques. Arthur is mentally ill and coping via meds and court-ordered therapy, which don\u2019t offer comfort or represent caring. He\u2019s devoted to his sick mother Penny (Frances Conroy), who\u2019s encouraged him to see himself as a joyous light in the world, bringing laughter to the people.\n\nThe problem is that he isn\u2019t particularly funny. He\u2019s painfully awkward, the kind of twitchy, social incompetence people shy away from in public because his erratic behavior feels like it could turn dangerous \u2014 or at least uncomfortable for them. It\u2019s easy for viewers to empathize with his desire to be loved, without necessarily loving him. When he says he feels invisible, it\u2019s clear why: he\u2019s the kind of person people look away from on the street, out of apathy or active discomfort.\n\nThat tension between sympathy and revulsion is one of the most honest things about Joker, which mostly goes out of its way to make the world awful. While working as a sign-twirler, Arthur is randomly beaten by a handful of kids, who steal his sign and then break it over his head. His boss not only doesn\u2019t believe his story, he demands Arthur pay for the missing sign. The dramatic ironies and injustices compound throughout the film, until it\u2019s clear that Arthur isn\u2019t paranoid, the world really is out to get him. And then he takes violent, irrevocable action.\n\nFor much of its runtime, Joker is a consciously ugly film, visually and emotionally. Arthur starts with close to nothing, and loses it all incrementally, in ways designed to hurt empathetic viewers. Phillips and cinematographer Lawrence Sher (who also DP\u2019d for all three of Phillips\u2019 Hangover movies) give the film a sickeningly grungy, underlit, David Fincher-esque look, especially in Arthur\u2019s squalid home. Everything about the storytelling \u2014 the ominous, booming score; the gritty darkness; the invasive sound design \u2014 is designed to be oppressive, and to push the audience toward Arthur\u2019s point of view as the primary victim of all the oppression. It\u2019s hypnotic just how horrifying Arthur\u2019s existence is, just as Phoenix\u2019s performance is hypnotic as he spirals from fragile hope into increasingly outsized and confident acts of destruction.\n\nAnd then he escapes it all, by learning not to care \u2014 not about how or whether other people see him, not about whether he hurts or frightens or kills them, not about whether his final-act manifesto makes any sort of coherent sense. The important part of Arthur\u2019s story \u2014 and the cause for so much of the concern around Joker \u2014 is that when he embraces his most nihilistic and destructive impulses, he suddenly earns the praise and attention he\u2019s been lacking. That may not fully motivate him, but it\u2019s meant as a message for the segment of the audience that feels closest to Arthur, those who feel most unseen and unloved: plenty of people agree with you that the world is unfair and ugly, and if you did something about it, they\u2019d back your play.\n\nLike Falling Down \u2014 and Martin Scorsese\u2019s Taxi Driver, which Phillips openly emulates and references \u2014 Joker suggests that when the leading man loses his mind, it\u2019s an understandable, even natural reaction to an equally mad world. Viewers who aren\u2019t already inclined to see humanity as a seething cesspit may not resonate with that level of cynicism. But to viewers who feel as abused and overlooked as Arthur Fleck, or even who harbor smaller, more rational resentments about society, Joker is a deliberate and fine-tuned provocation and promise: you aren\u2019t alone, the people you hate really are awful, and it would be okay to act against them in any way you want.\n\nPhillips has made it clear that he doesn\u2019t believe Joker is anything as small and dismissible as a mere comic-book movie. But while his film is grimmer and more harrowing than anything in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it\u2019s offering up a fantasy just as clearly as any superhero wish-fulfillment power trip: the fantasy of being a hero to some, of going from powerlessness to power, of being feared and beloved at the same time. Phillips delivers that message in a self-congratulatory way, largely by setting the film in a world where Arthur has no choice but violence, and no escape but madness. He\u2019s portrayed as a kind of dark truth-teller because he\u2019s learned that the world is a joke and nothing matters.\n\nThat\u2019s a fairly adolescent outlook, which Phillips embraces in the same persecution-complex spirit that recently led him to complain that he had to make Joker because the world is now too sensitive and woke for his previous brand of destructive-bro comedy. But Joker would probably be raising much less social concern if it wasn\u2019t such a technically compelling movie, if its final moments weren\u2019t so outsized and joyous and purposefully insane.\n\nBecause Joker does play \u2014 not just to its most put-upon, angry, repressed viewers \u2014 but to the entire audience\u2019s darkest hearts. It shows someone suffering when he lets society have its way with him, and freed when he has his way with society. It shows him weeping alone when he plays by the rules, and dancing wildly in public when he decides to break those rules. The story hurts and harms him, but Phillips suggests in the end that everything he went through was necessary to bring him the power and recognition he deserves. It\u2019s a tempting fantasy, crafted with utter conviction.\n\nMany critics and early viewers have responded to Joker with loathing, because that fantasy is so selfish and solipsistic. By dismissing the world as imbalanced at best, outright malicious at worst, Phillips is enabling his viewers\u2019 worst and most destructive impulses. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to feel so bad anymore,\u201d Arthur says plaintively at one point. He\u2019s a relatable kind of villain, harmless and sad \u2014 not an Everyman, but an audience avatar for the downtrodden. And then he models a way to not be harmless anymore. That doesn\u2019t necessarily make Joker a call to action, or an invitation to real-life violence. But it does represent a horrifying form of invitation \u2014 not just a call to sympathize with the devil, but a full-blown justification for the hell he creates.", "description": "Todd Phillips\u2019 Joker, a new origin story for Batman\u2019s most ruthless villain, turns a persecution complex into a wish-fulfillment power trip.
