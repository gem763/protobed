Police did not confirm whether the child was a boy or a girl.\n\nPHOTO: Police say this is the car the child\u2019s stepmother was in when the shooting occurred.\n\n\n\nAuthorities say she drove home after hearing the shots fired and didn\u2019t realize her car and the child had been struck until after she parked.@6abc pic.twitter.com/hjADYuiqum \u2014 George Solis (@GeorgeSolis) October 20, 2019\n\nPolice canvassed the crime scene looking for shell casings and appealing for witnesses to come forward who heard shots in the area. As of now, no physical evidence has been found from where the crime occurred.\n\nOnly a few blocks away about an hour before the 11-month-old child was shot, police reported that three men were injured in a triple shooting.\n\nPolice confirmed to WPVI that a 28-year-old man was shot in the stomach, a 41-year-old man was shot in the back and a 35-year-old man suffered a gunshot wound to the thigh. The three men are all expected to survive and are listed in stable condition.\n\nIt is unknown if the two incidents are related but police are investigating that possibility. No arrests have been made in either one of the cases.", "description": "An 11-month-old baby is in extremely critical condition after being shot four times while seated inside the back of a car in Philadelphia.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/police-gty-er-191009_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
