BAC, +0.66% Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said the fact that the U.S. consumer continues to spend is the one simple reason he doesn\u2019t believe a recession looms as many fear. And Deutsche Bank economist Justin Weidner wrote in a note to clients Friday that his outlook for consumer spending remains \u201crelatively upbeat\u201d the rest of the year, after a likely \u201crobust\u201d July.\n\nEven the Federal Reserve said in its most recent policy statement, as they cut interest rates, that \u201chousehold spending has picked up\u201d from earlier in the year.\n\nBut a closer look at multiple charts of stocks that track consumer behavior, in relation to the performance of the broader stock market and consumer confidence data, warn that the consumer has actually been fading for a while. And that could start acting as a drag on the broader market, and eventually the economy.\n\nStocks suggest consumers are spending on needs more than wants\n\n\u201cThe consumer discretionary sector is highly sensitive to what the overall stock market is doing, and to worries about economic growth and contraction,\u201d Tom McClellan, publisher of the McClellan Market Report, wrote in a recent newsletter to clients.\n\nOne way to see this relationship in real time is through a relative strength chart comparing consumer discretionary stocks, by way of the SPDR Consumer Discretionary Select Sector exchange-traded fund XLY, -0.60% (XLY), to the consumer staples sector, as tracked by the SPDR Consumer Staples Select Sector ETF XLP, -0.13% (XLP), then compared that chart to the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.06% .\n\nFactSet, MarketWatch\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking, the overall stock market tends to do best when XLY is winning the relative strength game,\u201d McClellan wrote.\n\nOutside of a big bounce in the first quarter, XLY-XLP relative-strength chart has been trending lower for more than a year, with the recent July recovery high coming in well below the April rally peak, and as last week's low was well below the June low.\n\nIn contrast, despite the August pullback, the S&P 500 continues to trend higher, as the August high was well above the May high, and this week\u2019s low was well above the June low.\n\nThe problem is, when the XLY-XLP and the S&P 500 have disagreed in the past, it was the XLY-XLP that proved prescient.\n\nRetail stocks are fading, and it\u2019s not all Amazon\u2019s fault\n\nAt first glance, last week appeared to be a great week for retailers, as shares of heavyweights Target Corp. TGT, -0.82% and Home Depot Inc. HD, +0.26% shot up to record highs after better-than-expected earnings reports.\n\nBut a relative strength chart comparing the SPDR S&P Retail ETF XRT, -0.95% (XRT) and the S&P 500 shows that last week\u2019s blip up was quickly brushed aside.\n\nFactSet, MarketWatch\n\nAnd while it\u2019s easy to blame Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.57% for retailers\u2019 troubles, Amazon\u2019s stock performance relative to the S&P 500 peaked about the same time the XRT did, suggesting the retail sector\u2019s troubles may run deeper than just competition.\n\nFactSet, MarketWatch\n\nConsumers don\u2019t seem to be putting their money where their confidence is\n\nConsumer confidence had resumed its climb to near 18-year high in July before pausing in August, at a time of some recent slowing in economic growth. Read more about second-quarter GDP.\n\nFactSet, MarketWatch\n\nThat by itself might lead one to believe that worries about the economy are overdone, until a five-year chart of consumer confidence is placed side-by-side with a chart of the XRT.\n\nThose charts usually move in tandem, but once in a while the charts diverge for short periods. When they do, the chart indicates stocks lead the data.\n\nFactSet, MarketWatch\n\nWhile it\u2019s easy to brush off the message of retailer stocks, considering the troubles the sector had faced in recent years evolving their consumer-facing models, this chart suggests that wouldn\u2019t be wise. When the XRT has diverged from the broader stock market at key turning points in the past, it has been the XRT that picked the right path.\n\nAnd keep in mind that confidence data is compiled via a survey by the Conference Board, so what consumers say may be very different from what they spend.\n\nIt\u2019s not just consumer stocks warning something is wrong\n\nConsumer discretionary and retail stocks aren\u2019t the only leading-type indicators that have been flashing similar bearish divergences. Small-capitalization stocks have been underperforming their large-cap brothers for years, financial stocks have been underperforming the market for the past 18 months, and the Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, +0.21% has been lagging behind the Dow Jones Industrial Average. DJIA, +0.16%\n\nRead more about small-cap underperformance: This stock-market canary has keeled over.\n\nAlso read: Dow transports getting dangerously close to a bearish signal.\n\nFactSet, MarketWatch\n\nAnd over the past 12 months, the three best-performing sectors have been defensive in nature. The SPDR Real Estate Select Sector ETF XLRE, +0.03% has run up 16%, the SPDR Utilities Select Sector ETF XLU, +0.03% has hiked up 17% and the XLP has advanced 11%, while the S&P 500 has slipped about 1%.\n\nGenerals should listen to what the soldiers are saying\n\nIt may be easy to dismiss the grumbling of a few sectors or stocks, when despite all the recent noise and macro headwinds, the S&P 500 sits just roughly 5% below its July 26 record close of 3,025.86.\n\nBut those who ignore previous lessons learned are doomed to repeat their losses. Just as one unnamed real estate tycoon who eventually became president said on CNBC in 2006 that it was a great time to start a mortgage company, the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF XHB, +0.45% warned that there was some trouble brewing in the housing market. And the stocks proved to be right.\n\nFactSet, MarketWatch\n\nAnd financial stocks pointed out that something was wrong, while bankers reassured investors everything was still peachy, a full year before Bear Stearns\u2019 failure warned that financial conditions were deteriorating into a crisis.\n\nFactSet, MarketWatch\n\nSo for those who know the power the consumer has over the economy, the message of consumer discretionary and retail stocks shouldn\u2019t be ignored.\n\nA bearish divergence in stock charts certainly isn\u2019t the best market-timing tool, because it can last indefinitely, and there is no guarantee that it will be prescient again. But it would be wise not to blindly believe the rhetoric about the \u201cstrength\u201d of the consumer or government data supporting healthy consumer spending.\n\nAndrew Adams at Saut Strategy wrote last week in a research note, the stock market is a \u201cleading economic indicator,\u201d given its uncanny ability to discount unforeseen trouble.\n\nThis updates a story that was originally published on Aug. 22.", "description": "Consumer discretionary and retail stocks are underperforming at an alarming rate, defying many calls about consumers\u2019 strength .", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ236_bear_t_ZG_20190827113435.jpg"}
