She recalled Ito said that \u201cwe can take small gifts anonymously.\u201d\n\nSwenson said she resigned in 2016 due to Epstein\u2019s involvement, telling Farrow that Epstein was accompanied by two young women at a meeting with the lab\u2019s leadership. She said she and other staff were fearful of the women\u2019s safety.\n\n\u201cWe literally had a conversation about how, on the off chance that they\u2019re not there by choice, we could maybe help them,\u201d she said.\n\nNEW MEXICO PREPARING TO SEIZE LAND AT EPSTEIN RANCH, OFFICIALS TELL FOX NEWS\n\nThe university revealed last month that it had accepted $800,000 from Epstein\u2019s foundations over 20 years and has apologized for it.\n\n\u201cWith hindsight, we recognize with shame and distress that we allowed MIT to contribute to the elevation of his reputation, which in turn served to distract from his horrifying acts. No apology can undo that,\u201d MIT\u2019s president, L. Rafael Reif, said in a statement.\n\nA university spokesman told The New Yorker that they are \u201clooking at the facts surrounding Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s gifts to the institute.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 request for comment was not immediately returned Saturday morning.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEpstein, 66, died last month in his prison cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City from suicide.
