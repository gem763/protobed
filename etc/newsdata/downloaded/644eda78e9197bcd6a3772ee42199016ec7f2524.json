I think it has served Australia well,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a new world with low interest rates, relatively low unemployment and low inflation. And if we\u2019re going to have a 2 to 3% band, then we want to hit that target. And as you know, inflation is currently 1.6%.\u201d\n\nFrydenberg\u2019s suggestion that the RBA would be under increased pressure to hit that target under a new agreement is a big departure from the previous one the RBA was operating under.\n\nBoth sides have previously watered down the need for strict inflation targets, and instead emphasised the broader objective of \u201cwelfare maximisation\u201d \u2014 the importance of which Governor Philip Lowe lauded just weeks ago.\n\n\u201cIt is worth remembering that inflation control is not the ultimate objective. Rather, it is a means to an end. And that end is the welfare of the society that we serve,\u201d he said, addressing economists at a charity lunch in July.\n\nIn other words, the RBA has in recent years aimed to keep the economy delivering as best it can for the Australian people given the circumstances, rather than only trying to kick growth between the 2-3% goal posts.\n\nHistorically that rate growth had been considered the optimal rate at which to grow the economy \u2014 quick enough to keep increasing wealth but slow enough so as not to lose control of the economy. However, with a global slowdown threatening, many developed economies have struggled to grow at that rate.\n\nIn this brave new world, central banks like the RBA have had to adapt, hence trying to keep the economy growing but with a focus on other objectives such as maintaining a strong labour force. This has kept Lowe from simply slashing interest rates \u2014 the RBA\u2019s most powerful tool \u2014 to 0% to hit the target.\n\nIt hints at a divide amongst economists. Critics of Lowe say he has no choice but to cut so shouldn\u2019t bide his time. Others have blamed persistently weak wage growth on his lack of focus on inflation.\n\nREAD MORE: Australian economists think the RBA\u2019s time is running out to cut\n\nThe man himself has time and time again signalled that while rates are destined to stay down, he would rather not have to reduce them again, arguing cuts will not substantially help the economy.\n\nInstead, he has encouraged the government to increase spending instead \u2014 a suggestion at which the government has scoffed.\n\nIf a new agreement is reached however, the RBA will have to answer to the government for low growth which is forecast to continue. That could renergise the RBA to cut again which will do more than increase inflation, Lowe has warned.\n\n\u201c[Our] decisions affect borrowing and asset prices and thus financial stability too. Central banks have to determine how to balance these considerations when making monetary policy decisions,\u201d he said.\n\nLower rates make borrowing cheaper, which in turn tends to flood the property market with cheap credit, driving prices up. Lowe has flagged this risk before, insisting he wants to grow the economy without creating a property bubble \u2014 another way of saying he wants to maximise the welfare of the country.\n\nGiven the recent surge in national house prices suggest that the last two cuts have already helped prop up prices, further cuts could simply add fuel to the fire.\n\n\u201cI sometimes feel that as some central banks sought to establish their credentials as inflation fighters they over-emphasised the importance of short-run inflation outcomes. And this has been difficult to walk back from,\u201d Lowe said.\n\nWhile some economists have criticised Lowe for dragging his feet on cutting rates, he has been trying to walk a fine line. A new agreement threatens to throw that out the window and force his hand.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
