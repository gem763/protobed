The PLAN has six Type 071s in service, with two more being built at the company's Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard in Shanghai.\n\nNo details regarding the price, delivery dates or onboard systems were disclosed, though Thai newspaper The Bangkok Post reported that the ship will cost $200.7 million, with construction to last three years. Thai media reports previously said the Chinese design would cost $130 million.\n\nThe People's Liberation Army's official news portal, Chinamail.com, reported that \"the Type 071E has been integrated with several major improvements and upgrades\" and is \"more advanced in technology and more powerful in comprehensive performance than the PLA's in-commission Type 071 integrated LPD.\"\n\nThe Yimeng Shan, a Chinese Type 071 amphibious transport dock ship.

The ship has a stern well dock that can launch and recover up to four Type 726 air-cushioned landing craft. It can also carry up to four large helicopters in its hangars and has two helicopter landing spots.\n\nThailand uses the carrying capacity of its amphibious ships for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief missions in response to natural disasters (mostly flooding as a result of annual monsoonal rains) in addition to more traditional military amphibious operations.\n\nThailand's naval force currently operates the HTMS Angthong, a 462-foot Endurance-class LPD acquired from the Marine division of Singapore's ST Engineering in 2008. That ship was put into service in 2012. The service has used its sole aircraft carrier HTMS Chakri Naruebet for disaster relief missions, acting as a helicopter carrier.\n\nThailand is a regional ally of the United States, having been designated a major non-NATO ally in 2003. However, like most other nations in the region, it also has close ties with China. Thai forces operate Chinese-built tanks and armored personnel carriers, and the country plans to acquire Chinese-built submarines.\n\nThe Thai military also conducts exercises with Chinese air and naval forces, with the People's Liberation Army Air Force recently deploying Chengdu J-10 fighters and airborne early warning aircraft to northern Thailand for the latest iteration of the Falcon Strike exercises.", "description": "The US designated Thailand a major non-NATO ally in 2003, but, like most countries in the region, Bangkok has close ties to China.", "authors": ["Mike Yeo", "Defense News"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7a848e2e22af19d9724377-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
