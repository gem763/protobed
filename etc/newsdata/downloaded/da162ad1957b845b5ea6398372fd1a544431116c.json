They listened attentively as an organiser went over tactics for slowing the police down and letting protesters escape: distract the officers by asking for change, to borrow their phone, or even by pretending to faint.\n\n\u201cAll we need to do is buy them a few minutes so the youngsters can get away,\u201d said Wong, 82, who has been placing himself between the protesters and the police over the last several months. \u201cWe tell the police: \u2018Please don\u2019t beat them up. Let them go. Maybe you could advance a little slower.\u2019\u201d\n\nHong Kong: \u2018Revolution is war, and no war is without bloodshed\u2019 Read more\n\nWong\u2019s group, known as the Guardians, whose stated mission is \u201cprotect the children\u201d, is one of many that have formed in response to pro-democracy protests. The demonstrations have led to more than 1,000 arrests and severely strained relations between Hong Kong authorities and the public.\n\nObservers say the informal groups of volunteers \u2013 from social workers and pastors to lawyers, doctors and first-aid medics \u2013 are a testament to the far-reaching impact of the demonstrations.\n\nMa Ngok, an associate professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said: \u201cThis is part of the spirit of the whole movement that different sectors of people are trying to see how they can contribute to the cause. A lot of people are still unhappy about the situation so they try to figure out what they can do by their own means.\u201d\n\nLater on Saturday, Uncle Wong and his group found a standoff between protesters and police near the airport. As soon as they arrived, Wong moved quickly to the front, armed with a pair of swimming goggles and his walking stick held aloft in front of him as a barrier. A few hours later, when the police charged at protesters, he did not flinch. One young demonstrator ran past and patted him on the shoulder.\n\n\u201cI have no regrets,\u201d Wong said. \u201cI\u2019m willing to take the blow for them. This whole protest needs everyone\u2019s support. If you don\u2019t come out today there may not be a tomorrow.\u201d\n\nHong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, has said she will withdraw an extradition bill that first triggered protests in June. But protesters have vowed to continue demonstrating until all their demands are met, including direct democratic elections and an independent inquiry into police conduct.\n\nAs the Guardians put themselves between police and protesters last weekend, teams of first-aid workers were sent to various locations of potential clashes throughout the city. Social workers monitored social media, looking for signs of self-harm or severe emotional distress among protesters. Others patrolled the streets, carrying megaphones to call out the names and identification numbers of demonstrators being arrested so that lawyers could find and help them.\n\nHammond Tang, 16, a former Scout, was part of a team of first-aid volunteers in Causeway Bay, a shopping district where the police were rumoured to be preparing to move on protesters. Equipped with walkie-talkies and packs of medical supplies, they were on high alert for \u201cTG\u201d \u2013 teargas.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Observers say the volunteers are a testament to the far-reaching impact of the demonstrations. Photograph: An Rong Xu/The Guardian\n\nDuring the last three months, Tang\u2019s responsibilities have shifted from pouring saline over those hit by teargas to tending to patients hit by rubber bullets and beanbag rounds. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect this many injuries,\u201d he said.\n\nTang\u2019s responsibilities also include breaking up fights between protesters and critics \u2013 altercations that happened almost daily, he said. This month a middle-aged man threw a brick at a protester outside Hong Kong airport and was soon surrounded by protesters kicking and hitting him. Tang, a stocky rugby player, raced over and covered the man with his body.\n\nA secondary school student, Tang is not always emotionally prepared for the amount of violence he encounters. \u201cSeeing everyone safe is our energy. To save more people \u2026 the thank you from those patients is what keeps me going to the frontline.\u201d\n\nMany of these groups are building on Hong Kong\u2019s increasingly active civil society, boosted in 2014 during a wave of pro-democracy protests known as the umbrella movement, a precursor to the current demonstrations.\n\nVictoria Hui, an associate professor of political science at Notre Dame University, said: \u201cThey were already there to jump into action. As the protests have evolved, preexisting groups and new groups have emerged to fill new needs.\u201d\n\nIn some ways they are also a reaction to what some see as the creeping politicisation of civil society, as pro-Beijing figures are appointed to head different public sectors. Hui said: \u201cThe worry is that Beijing already encroached on the civil service in the aftermath of the umbrella movement.\u201d\n\nUnlike formal civil society organisations, these groups are loosely organised and often started by individual calls for action online, mirroring how the protesters have operated. A group of Christians maintain a 24-hour channel on Telegram for protesters to share their feelings. Supporters organise supply collections, leaving money, food vouchers, and clothes in metro stations for protesters to change into from their signature all-black outfits.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The groups are loosely organised and often started by individual calls for action online.

After discussing it with his wife, he arrived at a nearby bridge where dozens of drivers had converged and a volunteer told him where to go. Daniel stayed out until almost 2am, waiting in case he could be of assistance.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey are Hong Kong\u2019s future. I want to do something to help them. We have to trust each other and stick together.\u201d\n\nAs the protests have divided society, some groups have sought to act as objective observers. Since mid-August, the Hong Kong Neutral Legal Observers Group, a group of about 50 volunteers from the legal sector, have been attending the protests.\n\nIn green vests identifying themselves as neutral, they attend the protests in shifts, documenting their observations for reports to be published later. They also hold public workshops educating residents on their legal rights and obligations.\n\n\u201cOur purpose is to observe public gatherings and defend the rule of law,\u201d said one of the conveners of the group, a partner in the Hong Kong office of an international law firm, who asked not to be named out of concern of possible retribution. \u201cWe hope that the presence of lawyers might serve as a reminder of how important it is to respect the law and the rule of law.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Edwin Lee and An Rong Xu", "description": "Informal group including social workers, pastors, lawyers and medics have banded together to support demonstrators", "authors": ["Lily Kuo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d8537f30ba6c197d2aba8efa0d079f61a19b5de/0_408_6124_3675/master/6124.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=05f70f6d9551665763cbcd33304f7d15", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
