Rodney Davis Rodney Lee DavisHouse panel pushes forward election security legislation GOP lawmaker: We're past point of doing separate infrastructure bill The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by National Association of Manufacturers - Trump, Congress draw battle lines on impeachment MORE (R-Ill.), the top Republican on the House Administration Committee and the primary sponsor of the bill, told The Hill in a statement that he was putting forward the legislation due to the \u201cunacceptable\u201d nature of Russian misinformation efforts in the lead-up to the 2016 elections.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe may never be able to prevent criminal activity, whether that\u2019s in our elections or in our day-to-day lives, but we can provide our law enforcement with the best tools and resources available,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt's imperative that our elections systems are free from foreign influence, and I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support this legislation and put the needs of the American people first.\"\n\nWhat the bill does: The Honest Elections Act would expand the prohibition on foreign nationals contributing to campaigns to include state and local initiatives and referendums.\n\nIt would also codify existing Federal Election Commission guidance to require that all online political advertisements include a disclosure of who paid for them, such as with a \u201cclick-through\u201d option, where the individual could click to a second page for information on who purchased the ad.\n\nThe context: The bill\u2019s introduction comes on the heels of a heated debate between Davis and Democratic members of the House Administration Committee over the SHIELD Act earlier this week. That legislation, which the committee approved in a 6-1 vote, required that political ads on social media platforms be subject to the same rules that those on television or radio are.\n\nDavis pushed back against the SHIELD Act during the committee markup, describing it as \u201cunfixable in its current form.\u201d\n\nRead more on the bill here.\n\nWATERS GETTING CHOPRA-Y: Rohit Chopra, a Democrat on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), on Friday testified before a House panel that he is concerned the U.S. government is \"too often captured\" by the country's largest tech companies.\n\nChopra made the comments during a hearing about data privacy before the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, which has been investigating whether the top technology firms wield their power in the marketplace.\n\n\"All too often, the government is too captured by those incumbents that use their power to dictate their preferred policies,\" Chopra said, discussing his concerns around the unprecedented power and strength of Big Tech. He did not name any specific agency or company.\n\nChopra, a Democratic official who formerly helped Sen.

We urge you in the strongest terms to reconsider your decision with respect to Mr. Chung.\u201d\n\nSens.
