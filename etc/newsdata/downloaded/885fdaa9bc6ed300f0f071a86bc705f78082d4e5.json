NASA\u2019s Curiosity rover discovers ancient oasis on Mars 3.5 billion years in the making (PHOTOS)", "language": "en", "text": "The surface of Mars is a frigid unwelcoming desert, but once upon a billions years ago there was an oasis, says a new study based on discoveries made by NASA\u2019s Curiosity rover. But one mystery remains: was there life?\n\nUsing data gathered by the aptly named rover, scientists have determined a 100-mile-wide crater on the planet\u2019s surface, dubbed \u201cGale,\u201d was once dotted with small, salty lakes and ponds some 3.5 billion years ago. The finding provides a window deep into the Red Planet\u2019s history, to a time when it may have been capable of sustaining life.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding when and how the planet's climate started evolving is a piece of [a] puzzle: When and how long was Mars capable of supporting microbial life at the surface?\u201d asked William Rapin, lead author of a study on some of Curiosity\u2019s discoveries published in the Nature Geoscience journal on Monday.\n\nThe remnant of a massive asteroid or meteoroid impact, Gale Crater preserves a \u201cunique record of a changing Mars,\u201d Rapin said, making it the ideal place to search for evidence of the planet\u2019s prehistoric climate.\n\nOne section of the crater known as \u201cOld Soaker\u201d contains perhaps the clearest signs of an ancient oasis, leaving behind what appears to be a lake bed of dried, cracked mud. Scientists believe the region underwent a cycle of wet and dry periods, before ultimately desiccating to its current state.\n\nTo better imagine how Mars\u2019s oasis may have appeared in its prime, one might look closer to home. Rapin suggested the saline lakes on South America\u2019s high planes, which are also known by their distinct reddish appearance, might offer a general idea.\n\nCuriosity landed on the surface of Mars in 2012, where it has collected samples and studied the planet\u2019s climate and geology for over 2,600 consecutive days, far surpassing its initial two-year mission. The car-sized rover is now in the process of scaling Mount Sharp, the huge landmass smack in the center of the Gale Crater.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
