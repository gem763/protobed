During the summer I wouldn\u2019t use them, but I did lay out by the pool a lot, where I would get burnt or tanned,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the winter when it was cold out, I would typically use sunbeds a few times a week. It was something I did with my roommates, and we loved it.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nTrout said she felt being tanned made her \u201clook better and [look] thinner.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never thought it would happen to me. But it did.\" \u2014 Natalie Trout\n\n\u201cEveryone around me was tanning, and I was insecure enough at the time to feel like I needed to use sunbeds as well,\u201d she added. \u201cUsually I would burn, but that didn\u2019t matter. To me, it was better to be burnt than pale. Pale was almost unacceptable at the time.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Trout noticed a \u201cdry, red spot\u201d on her right cheek. A dermatologist later told her the spot was pre-cancerous and should be removed, suggesting Trout undergo cryotherapy, or a procedure that uses liquid nitrogen to \u201cfreeze and destroy abnormal cells,\u201d per Cancer.Net.\n\nBut the spot returned roughly a year later, Trout said. She was subsequently diagnosed with melanoma, a type of skin cancer.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard the news, at first I was in disbelief,\" she said. \"It could have been a lot worse, so I was glad it would hopefully be fixed with surgery. But it also wasn\u2019t a best-case scenario, as there is a stage zero melanoma. I was a stage one.\"\n\n\u201cI remember driving to my parents\u2019 house, and I hadn\u2019t even cried yet. Then, when I saw my parents, I broke down,\u201d Trout continued. \u201cI had skin cancer, and not just any skin cancer, but the deadliest kind.\u201d\n\nEX-CHEERLEADER'S SKIN CANCER LEFT HER WITH GAPING HOLE IN HEAD\n\nThough successful, surgery to remove the cancerous spot left Trout with a sizable hole in her cheek, which many people mistook for a dog bite, she said.\n\nFollowing the procedure, Trout said she met with an oncologist, though she did not require further treatment. Rather, she said, she used the appointment as an opportunity to learn more about melanoma.\n\n\u201cShe taught me a lot about melanoma, and I learned how to check my lymph nodes for any irregularities, as this is where melanoma will spread to, if not detected otherwise,\u201d she said. \u201cMy oncologist said it was likely a combination of sunbeds and natural sunlight that led to melanoma; I simply didn\u2019t take good care of my skin.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt never occurred to me how much harm I was doing to myself. Even when people would warn me about skin cancer, I would think to myself, \u2018It won\u2019t happen to me.\u2019\u201d\n\nPORTRAITS REVEAL 'INVISIBLE' SKIN IMPERFECTIONS CAUSED BY UV RAYS\n\nSkin cells are damaged when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light, which is present in both the sun and tanning beds. In fact, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation, those who use tanning beds before the age of 35 \u201cincrease their risk for melanoma by 75 percent.\u201d\n\nFollowing her health scare, Trout said she is now very diligent when it comes to taking care of her skin and noted she sees her dermatologist every six months to ensure she has not developed melanoma anywhere else on her body.\n\n\u201cSkincare is very important to me now. I wear SPF 30 on my face every single day, and there is sun protection in my makeup,\" she said. \"If I\u2019m going to the pool or the beach, I always wear at least SPF 50 all over my body, and usually a large hat to shade my face and shoulders. I simply can\u2019t take the risk of getting burnt.\"\n\n\u201cI never thought it would happen to me. But it did. Skin cancer doesn\u2019t discriminate,\u201d she added. \u201cBeing tanned is not more important than being healthy. Take care of your skin. And if you see any suspicious spots, don\u2019t wait to see a dermatologist. Even if it turns out to be nothing, at least you know.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nTrout\u2019s story comes after a \u201cdiehard\u201d tanner was left with a hole in her nose and staples in her face after she, too, developed skin cancer likely linked to her tanning habits.", "description": "An Indiana woman is warning others of the dangers of tanning beds after she developed melanoma, which, following its removal, left a massive hole in her cheek.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Natalie Trout", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
