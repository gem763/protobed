Mariota had already been feeling the pressure from the newly signed Ryan Tannehill, who was reportedly challenging for the starting job in training camp and preseason.\n\nHelping Mariota will be running back Derrick Henry, wide receivers Corey Davis and Adam Humphries, and tight end Delanie Walker. Mariota will need all the help on offense to make some noise in the AFC South, which appears to be a little bit more open after the retirement of Andrew Luck.\n\nTennessee was among the best defenses in the league last season and added Cameron Wake from the Miami Dolphins in the offseason.\n\nAnother solid season defensively would give the Titans at least an outside chance of making the playoffs this season.\n\nRead below for more about the Titans heading into the 2019 season.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n--\n\n2019 SCHEDULE\n\nWeek Date Time (ET) Channel Opponent 1 Sept. 8 1:00 pm CBS @ Cleveland Browns 2 Sept. 15 1:00 pm CBS Indianapolis Colts 3 Sept. 19 8:20 pm NFL @ Jacksonville Jaguars 4 Sept. 29 1:00 pm CBS @ Atlanta Falcons 5 Oct. 6 1:00 pm CBS Buffalo Bills 6 Oct. 13 4:25 pm CBS @ Denver Broncos 7 Oct. 20 4:05 pm CBS Los Angeles Chargers 8 Oct. 27 1:00 pm FOX Tampa Bay Buccaneers 9 Nov. 3 1:00 pm CBS @ Carolina Panthers 10 Nov. 10 1:00 pm CBS Kansas City Chiefs 11 Bye 12 Nov. 24 4:05 pm CBS Jacksonville Jaguars 13 Dec. 1 1:00 pm CBS @ Indianapolis Colts 14 Dec. 8 4:25 pm CBS @ Oakland Raiders 15 Dec. 15 1:00 pm CBS Houston Texans 16 Dec. 22 1:00 pm FOX New Orleans Saints 17 Dec. 29 1:00 pm CBS @ Houston Texans\n\n--\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nQB: Marcus Mariota\n\nRB: Derrick Henry\n\nWR: Corey Davis\n\nTE: Delanie Walker\n\nLB: Cameron Wake\n\nCB: Logan Ryan\n\nS: Kelvin Byard\n\n--\n\nTITANS DRAFT PICKS\n\nRound 1, Pick 19: Jeffrey Simmons, DL\n\nRound 2, Pick 51: A.J.
