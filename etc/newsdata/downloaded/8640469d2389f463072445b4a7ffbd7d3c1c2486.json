In the most recent fiscal year devices produced less than 5% of Microsoft's total revenue, at $6.1 billion, up about 19% from the same period one year earlier.\n\nSince 2012, Microsoft's Surface brand -- from the little Surface Go to the elaborate Surface Studio desktop -- has inspired new types of computers from the likes of Dell, HP and Lenovo. They haven't become universal hits, though, in the same way that Apple's iPhone has.", "description": "Microsoft's two-screened laptop, the Surface Neo, is coming next holiday season.", "authors": ["Jordan Novet"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106160533-1570028989461surfaceneo3.jpg?v=1570029295"}
