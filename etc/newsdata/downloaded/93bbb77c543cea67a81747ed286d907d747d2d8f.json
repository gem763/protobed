Col. Alexander Vindman\u2019s 10-hour testimony before the House committees marked the first time lawmakers heard from someone who listened to President Donald Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe impeachment investigation centers around the July 25 call where Trump asks Ukraine to investigate political opponent Vice President Joe Biden in return for U.S. foreign aid.\n\nWhen Vindman said it was his \u201csacred duty\u201d to speak up in his opening statement, everybody listened. So, who is this White House aide and why is his testimony so important to the impeachment investigation?\n\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman biography\n\nVindman was only 3 years old in 1979, when he and his two brothers, father and grandmother fled Ukraine, then a Soviet republic, for the U.S. His mother died in Ukraine before they immigrated to the U.S.\n\nHis family was highlighted in a photo essay by photographer Carol Kitman, who first spotted Vindman and his twin brother in 1980 walking hand in hand with their grandmother under elevated train tracks in Brooklyn's Little Odessa neighborhood.\n\nVindman and his twin also made an appearance as boys in Ken Burns' 1985 documentary \"The Statue of Liberty,\" which explored how the landmark has become a symbol of hope and refuge for generations of immigrants.\n\nMore names to know:All of the people who have been subpoenaed so far in House Democrats' impeachment inquiry\n\nPelosi responds to Trump tweet:'Everybody has read your words on the call'\n\n\"Upon arriving in New York City in 1979, my father worked multiple jobs to support us, all the while learning English at night,\" Vindman said in his prepared testimony. \"He stressed to us the importance of fully integrating into our adopted country. For many years, life was quite difficult. In spite of our challenging beginnings, my family worked to build its own American dream.\"\n\nHe took part in the ROTC program while attending the State University of New York at Binghamton and later earned a master's degree from Harvard University in Russian, Eastern Europe and Central Asian studies.\n\nEarlier in his Army career, he served as an infantry officer and did tours in South Korea, Germany and Iraq. In October 2004, not long into his yearlong tour in Iraq, he was wounded by a roadside bomb and awarded the Purple Heart, according to the Defense Department. Vindman showed up to Tuesday's hearing in full uniform, including his Purple Heart ribbon, a Ranger tab and Combat Infantry Badge.\n\nWhat does Vindman do at the White House?\n\nVindman is the Director for European Affairs at the National Security Council.\n\nSince 2008, he's served as a foreign area officer specializing in Eurasia, leading him to stints in Kiev and Moscow. He also served as a political-military affairs officer for Russia for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He moved to the Trump White House in July 2018 after being tapped to serve on the NSC.\n\nHis tasks consists of \u201cdeveloping, coordinating, and executing plans and policies to manage the full range of diplomatic, informational, military and economic national security\u201d for the countries in his portfolio, which included Ukraine and Russia, according to his opening statement.\n\nApart from the controversial call, Vindman was also present in an April 21 call where Trump congratulated Zelensky on his victory. He was also tasked to attend his inauguration in May.\n\nWhat did he say in his testimony?\n\nVindman testified Tuesday that he raised concerns twice that Trump and his European Union ambassador, Gordon Sondland, inappropriately pushed Ukrainian leaders to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nHe told House investigators that he raised his concerns after he listened with other aides to Trump's July 25 and concluded that it was improper \"to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen.\"\n\n\"I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine,\" he said.\n\nHe said he also raised concerns with the NSC's legal counsel after a July 10 meeting in which Sondland stressed the importance of having Ukraine investigate the 2016 election as well as Burisma, a company linked to the family of Biden.\n\nIs Alexander Vindman a Democrat?\n\nVoting records show Vindman was previously registered as a Democrat.\n\nTrump took to Twitter to slam Vindman as a \"Never Trumper\" who he was unfamiliar with.\n\n\"Supposedly, according to the Corrupt Media, the Ukraine call 'concerned' today's Never Trumper witness. Was he on the same call that I was?\" Trump tweeted. \"Can't be possible! Please ask him to read the Transcript of the call.\"\n\nBehind the scenes, White House officials sought to downplay the issues raised by Vindman. Senior administration officials argued that his opening statement showed he had a \"policy dispute\" with the president and other White House officials over Ukraine aid.\n\nSome Trump backers and conservatives questioned Vindman's loyalty because he was born in Ukraine.\n\nTrump impeachment inquiry latest:Pelosi calls for Republicans to put country over party\n\nWhat's next?:House resolution outlines public phase of impeachment inquiry, gives GOP subpoena powers\n\nVindman \"is incredibly concerned about Ukrainian defense,\" former Rep. Sean Duffy, a Wisconsin Republican and a Trump supporter, said in a CNN interview. \"I don't know about his concern (for) American policy, but his main mission was to make sure the Ukraine got those weapons. I understand it: We all have an affinity to our homeland where we came from. Like me, I'm sure that Vindman has the same affinity.\"\n\nFox News's Laura Ingraham suggested that Vindman was \"advising Ukraine while working inside the White House apparently against the president's interest.\"\n\nMichael McFaul, who served as U.S. ambassador to Russia under Obama, worked with Vindman in Moscow.\n\n\"Vindman is a patriot, who has served his country with honor both on and off the battlefield,\" he tweeted. \"He was a first rate officer at the embassy, one of the best on the team.\"\n\nContributing: Savannah Behrmann, Christal Hayes and Nicholas Wu, USA TODAY; Aamer Madhani, Robert Burns, Zeke Miller and Alan Fram, Associated Press.
