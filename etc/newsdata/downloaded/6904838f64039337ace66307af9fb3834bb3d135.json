In the process of announcing the US response, Lighthizer reminded the world the subsidies had harmed Boeing in Australia.\n\nHe said the WTO arbitrator found the \u2018\u2018EU aid for Airbus is causing significant lost sales of Boeing large civil aircraft, as well as impeding exports of Boeing large aircraft to the EU, Australia, China, Korea, Singapore, and UAE markets\u2019\u2019.\n\nSir Michael is confident Boeing will win the Qantas contract, just as it was successful in winning the Perth to London long-haul route with Qantas. That contract generated about $100 million in publicity for Boeing and Qantas, according to research commissioned by Qantas.\n\n\u2018\u2018We think we\u2019ve got a fantastic offering,\u2019\u2019 Sir Michael says.\n\n\u2018\u2018Qantas has a challenge that\u2019s unique in the world, and that is the distance factor. From Australia, getting point-to-point to the furthest cities in the world, we think we have a solution for that.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe says Boeing likes competition but only on a level playing field. \u2018\u2018We never mind a fight but what we don\u2019t like is an unfair fight,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018\u2018The WTO had a statement which said that if they had not had these subsidies some of their aeroplanes would not exist \u2013 we believe that\u2019s unfair competition.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoyce said Qantas is working independently with both Boeing and Airbus on the performance and design parameters. A few months ago Qantas received \u2018\u2018best and final\u2019\u2019 offers from both Airbus and Boeing for the aircraft. Both have proven they can do \u2018\u2018critical missions\u2019\u2019 with a commercial payload.\n\nJoyce will be on two Sunrise Project test flights of 787 Dreamliners which are coming off the production line at Boeing\u2019s plant in Seattle over the next few months. They will be positioned in London and New York before being flown non-stop to Sydney.\n\nThe success or otherwise of Joyce\u2019s strategy is tied up with the completion of a range of other negotiations with unions and regulators. For example, Qantas has asked pilots for productivity gains in order to make the business case.\n\nAt the moment the Civil Aviation Safety Authority does not allow pilots to travel for periods beyond 20 hours and the trip from Sydney to New York would be about 21 hours.\n\nThe fight between Boeing and Airbus is getting to the pointy end, with Joyce flagging a decision by the end of the year. This deal will not result in huge volumes of new aircraft being sold to Qantas, but it will have significant flow-on effects for the winning airline.\n\nQantas is regarded as a global leader in safety and endurance flying and that means the rest of the global aviation market will be keenly interested in what Joyce finally chooses.\n\nBoeing and Airbus have competed fiercely for decades. In fact, there are some in aviation circles who believe their contest to build the most fuel-efficient planes had contributed to the accidents involving the 737 MAX, which killed 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia.\n\nSir Michael said it was a tough week for Boeing because it was the anniversary of the crash of the Lion Air Flight 610.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018This is a tough month for us. We have as a company for the last year been totally focused on how we can get out from that problem, because safety is paramount, and has been for 100 years.\n\n\u2018\u2018We have thrown everything at making sure there are no lapses. We have improved the software. The software was one element in the chain of events in the accidents.\u2019\u2019\n\nSafety, quality first\n\nSir Michael, who joined Boeing five years ago and is the only non-American on the executive committee, says the culture of the company has been shaped by a program called One Boeing.\n\nHe says this program puts safety and quality at the forefront of what the company does.\n\nSir Michael says Boeing is in daily contact with aviation regulators in the US, but the company is hopeful to have 737 MAX aircraft approved for flight before the end of the year.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are confident when they are back in flight, this is the safest plane we have ever made,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018We believe that. It\u2019s not just a word of propaganda. Safety is the core of aviation and that\u2019s what we live to do.\u2019\u2019\n\nStockmarket investors have not lost confidence in Boeing\u2019s financial prospects because of the 737 MAX safety failures. The stock trades on a forward price earnings multiple of about 75, which is what you would pay for a fast-growing software company.\n\nOnly four of the 28 analysts that cover the stock have a \u2018\u2018sell\u2019\u2019 recommendation, while 10 have a \u2018\u2018hold\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018neutral\u2019\u2019 rating and the remainder label the stock a \u2018\u2018buy\u2019\u2019.", "description": "Australia is the battleground for a bare-knuckle fight over which of Boeing or Airbus will supply aircraft for Qantas' so-called Project Sunrise.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4099%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_239%2C$y_145/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/36e443d620af63d2420091b4da12d33552162f93", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
