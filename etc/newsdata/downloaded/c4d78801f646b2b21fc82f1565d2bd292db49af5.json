We haven't seen them produce anything for the civilian market since then. However, now AM is partnering with Jeep to turn the increasingly popular Gladiator into this badass military truck called the Gladiator XMT.\n\nPhoto credit: AM General More\n\nPhoto credit: AM General More\n\nThe XMT stands for \"Extreme Military-Grade Truck,\" and this concept truck is pretty extreme. From these photos released by AM, we can see a beige model with the doors and roof removed and a huge brush guard mounted on the front bumper. There are two other variants, with one looking somewhat like a transport vehicle. The XMT is fitted with massive BFGoodrich tires, two 4x4 systems, locking differentials, skid plates, and tow hooks. It has a 54-degree approach angle and a 30-degree departure angle, making this concept truck even more off-road capable than the already off-road capable Gladiator on which it's based.\n\n\n\nPhoto credit: AM General More\n\nThe truck weighs in at about 12,800 pounds, and the winch can withstand up to 12,000 pounds. Keep in mind that the already highly capable standard Gladiator has 7650 pounds of towing capacity with the Max Tow package and up to 1600 pounds of payload. The XMT matches both of these numbers.", "description": "Jeep and AM General could re-enlist with the U.S. Army as soon as next year.", "authors": ["Connor Hoffman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eiQ5lHrXR6iWWdTVO994Mw--~B/aD03MjE7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/2d32c09cd858d325c8bf5d3caad05fea", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
