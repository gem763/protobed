However, she didn\u2019t make any money off her viral video nor did she earn a dime from her appearances as a member of Team USA.\n\nCLICK TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nIn a New York Times op-ed on Wednesday, the six-time All-American slammed the NCAA and said she was \u201chandcuffed\u201d by the college athletics\u2019 governing body.\n\n\u201cAlong with this came a lot of attention and opportunities, but I couldn't capitalize on them. I was handcuffed by the NCAA rules that prevented me from deriving any benefit from my own name and likeness, regardless of the fact that after my final meet, I had no pro league to join,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe NCAA is a billion-dollar industry built on the backs of college athletes.

It\u2019s about recognizing that women only receive 4 percent of coverage in sports media and giving us the freedom to leverage sponsor deals to breakthrough. It\u2019s about treating student-athletes with the same respect as any other students who can freely profit off their talent as writers, artists, DJs, programmers or scientists while in college.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe law will not go into effect until 2023. Several other states have discussed similar bills. Either way, the NCAA will have to reckon with the fact that at least some student-athletes will be paid in the near future.", "description": "Katelyn Ohashi blasted the NCAA over its rules regarding paying student-athletes.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/katelyn-ohashi-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
