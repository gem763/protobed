We gotta go to Mexico.'\n\nCandid conversation: The 41-year-old TV presenter revealed the medical diagnosis on her podcast Better Together this Monday\n\nMaria shared that in Mexico 'they are doing such incredible treatments. It\u2019s funny because our medical system, because of the limitations financially and so much more, you know they test your blood for like your A1C and your thyroid and your cholesterol and just a few things.'\n\nShe added: 'Like, they\u2019re not checking your inflammation markers like extensively and all this other stuff. But in Mexico they check everything. And so they\u2019re gonna do all the immune system-boosting things, like the Vitamin C drips and natural killer cell immunotherapies and all kinds of amazing stuff.\n\nThe TV personality explained that she would rather 'avoid radiation. They had a surgery date on the books and now they\u2019ve retracted that because Dr. Black feels like it\u2019s not the best option for her. So I\u2019m really glad that that is off the table.'\n\nIt was Dr. Keith L. Black who excised Maria's own brain tumor on her 39th birthday in June 2017, she revealed to People magazine shortly after.\n\nPictured in 2013: 'And when you have glioblastoma, that's to be expected in a sense, but something you never wanna hear happen, so it's been a rough little time' shared Maria\n\nMaria said on her podcast this week that recently 'I was just getting so stressed because [her mother] was telling me about different things that were not right with her. And I was like: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me before?\u201d\n\n'Because I ask her every day how she\u2019s feeling and does she have any new symptoms, and she doesn\u2019t tell me anything, because she forgets,' she said.\n\n'And because her brain isn\u2019t working 100% properly, that doesn\u2019t get communicated to me until it\u2019s a 911 situation, and then I\u2019m in a 911 situation. So I\u2019m getting all these pains in my body, like, that just didn\u2019t even make sense. Like my groin, it was like someone was stabbing me in the groin.'\n\nMaria, who married her longtime beau Kevin in 2017, revealed: 'I was in so much pain because I just - everything is on me to keep her alive, and if something else that\u2019s kind of treatable and simple takes her, like I start to, like, lose it.'", "description": "Maria Menounos has 'pains in my body' from the stress of her mother Litsa's brain tumor recurrence.", "authors": ["Sameer Suri For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/16/19449674-0-image-a-18_1570549381656.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
