Photo: Eve Arnold/Magnum Photos\n\nCan a museum devoted to modernism survive the death of the movement? Can it bring that death about? Ever since the beginnings of the Renaissance in the 14th century, most art movements have lasted one generation, sometimes two. Today, after more than 130 years, modernism is, at least by some measures, insanely and incongruously popular \u2014 a world brand. The first thing oligarchs do to signal sophistication, and to cleanse and store money, is collect and build personal museums of modern art, and there\u2019s nothing museumgoers love more than a survey of a mid-century giant. In the U.S., modernism represents the triumph of American greatness and wealth, and it is considered the height of 20th-century European culture \u2014 which Americans bought and brought over (which is to say, poached).\n\nKids sport tattoos of artworks by Gustav Klimt, Henri Matisse, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Edvard Munch, Piet Mondrian, and Andy Warhol (you might not think of him as a modernist, but we\u2019ll get to that). Our cities are crowded with glass-walled luxury riffs on high-modernist architecture, the apartments inside full of knockoffs of \u201cmid-century-modern\u201d furniture. Donald Judd\u2019s sleepy minimalist studio outpost in Marfa is now East Hampton in West Texas, a secular pilgrimage site for millionaire collectors, full of expensive restaurants and fancy second homes. As recently as 1994, my wife and I were offered a house there for $5,000.\n\nAnd people pay \u2014 not just for the art, or for environments that call it to mind, but to see the works themselves, even briefly. Witness the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s daily crowds, full-price guests forking over $25. Last year\u2019s annual attendance was just over 3 million (do the math). People take selfies with Starry Night; adolescents feel big feelings because the world didn\u2019t understand Vincent, though they have understood him very well now for well over a century. Movies are made about him and about Pablo Picasso, Paul Gauguin, Frida Kahlo, Jackson Pollock, and Warhol (and the woman who shot him). And Jean-Michel Basquiat \u2014 the most recent in the long line of world-straddling geniuses \u2014 who died in 1988 at the age of 27. We all know the stories, from destroying one\u2019s own work and committing suicide to womanizing and pissing in fireplaces (in this way, modernism is Hollywood Babylon). And while we take our parents to the Met to appreciate old art, tradition, and \u201cgood technique,\u201d we go to MoMA because modernism is cool, still \u2014 a sequence of revolutionary gestures, shocks, and succession stories that, we think, tell us something about radicalism and experimentation.\n\nThat reputation and those succession dramas are not an accident \u2014 they were forged by MoMA in cooperation with artists who very much wanted to see their own work as the natural end point of all art history. (Who wouldn\u2019t?) All this has prevailed since the museum\u2019s founding by wealthy New Yorkers. It opened nine days after the onset of the Great Depression in 1929. Three-quarters of a century after the real peak of modernism, the movement\u2019s grip is like a vise. It is why we are still so captivated by the allure of the avant-garde long after the avant-garde started sleepwalking. And it may be why we still believe artists are like gods long after they began sleeping with money and celebrity. People still quote Duchamp saying, \u201cA painting that doesn\u2019t shock isn\u2019t worth painting.\u201d Why are people still set on shocking their nanas? Modernism. Museums still present all of art history as a long story that breaks, dramatically, with the 20th century. Why? Modernism! Why do I keep asking myself if modernism is over yet? Modernism!\n\nI love modernism \u2014 a movement and a culture that can be defined in different ways and often is. I believe, and MoMA has long seemed to assert, that it began with Paul C\u00e9zanne\u2019s The Bather (c. 1885). Your starting and end points may vary, but you will surely recognize the formally daring work that defined the first half of the 20th century in Europe and America from school trips and dorm-room walls: Picasso and Matisse, O\u2019Keeffe and Pollock. In many ways, it can still feel truly shocking. Thousands of modernism\u2019s ideas are used by artists today, and I still love many of its artists. All of Picasso, Pollock\u2019s giant drip paintings, and Hilma af Klint\u2019s first forays into the deepest precincts of abstraction take my breath away.\n\nBut much of modernism and its concerns now feel long ago, forged in a time of rapid industrial change when white European males assumed they ruled the world. The demands of our times call for something else. And before you object that we\u2019ve been living for 50 years in postmodernism, not modernism, the art that followed the titans of the early-20th century was defined and even named after what preceded it (daddy issues?). What began with Pop and Warhol looked like a break from modernism, but it also extended modernism\u2019s fetishizing of novelty and a canon of iconoclasts. Modernism is part of my life story, all of our life stories, something that shaped the ways we see the world and how the world sees itself. But in the past couple of decades, seismic shifts have occurred, moving us for the first time far beyond the dictates of the movement. Modernism is not headed for the dustbin, but in terms of experimental one-upmanship and the conviction that each new work could break and redefine all of art history, a page is finally turning \u2014 slowly, a bit, at least.\n\nThis kind of change has happened before, of course \u2014 a movement conquering the world, then passing into the past. Usually, it happens much faster. The heyday of tremendous rococo artists like Fran\u00e7ois Boucher, Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, and Antoine Watteau lasted just 15 years, at which point neoclassicism deemed it girlie and gauche. Instead, artists like Jacques-Louis David painted gigantic, \u201cmasculine\u201d pictures of Roman virtue, the glories of Napoleon, the French Revolution, and mythic deaths \u2014 until David was arrested and thrown in prison. Even the High Renaissance came and went in less than 50 years. Impressionism lasted 25 years. By comparison, modernism is, at this point, ancient. Modeling it as something new and cool today would be like the original modernists modeling themselves after the art and values of 130 years before them: Boucher, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, and Antonio Canova. That modernism has been so canonized is especially ironic given that the earliest modernists were so desperate to break away from the art of the past that they scrapped Renaissance perspective and space. Duchamp wrote that he wanted to use a Rembrandt as an ironing board.\n\nWhich raises the question: If modernism wasn\u2019t the end point of art history and the ultimate form of artistic expression, then what was it? If we don\u2019t let it bully its way to the front of the line and center stage, crowding out everything that came before, during, and whatever comes after, what does it look like? And what will it look like as it recedes farther and farther in the rearview mirror and appears not to be the finale of everything that came before but just one more period in a never-ending sequence of them \u2014 one set of mannerisms followed by another? As great as many of modernism\u2019s artists are, a lot of this art is about itself, mainly white people arguing about other white people\u2019s art history. Once we\u2019ve left those arguments behind, it may be that the most striking legacy is the cult of the male artist and the competitive aesthetic messianism it spawned.\n\nOn October 21, the greatest collection of modern art on the planet will reopen at a new Museum of Modern Art. The newness is not due to a big move to another location or a billion-dollar structure springing up in the old footprint (that last happened in 2004, to so-so reviews), though much of the interior of the iconic \u2014 and blandly slick and cramped \u2014 building on 53rd Street has been redone and there are new galleries at the base of yet another new MoMA skyscraper full of very expensive condominiums. It is because of what will be presented inside and how.\n\nThe museum has traditionally hung its collection chronologically to tell a particular story. The story was: He begat him, who begat him, and so on, until modernism hung a sign on its door that said WE\u2019RE CLOSED (just as countless others showed up at the door). Of course, the story acknowledged, there were rivalries (Matisse vs. Picasso, for instance) and relevant source material and inspiration (again with Picasso). But in general, the story was one of rigid progression that looked, on the museum walls, almost inevitable. Which is exactly as the museum intended: An institution that came of age at the imperial height of the American Century, funded during the Cold War in part with CIA money meant to exalt and export a showcase of free expression (sometimes confused with free enterprise), it wanted viewers very much to believe that modernism was the \u201cultimate\u201d movement in both senses of the word.\n\nNewness is as old as time. The modernists were just a lot cockier about saying so.\n\nIn 1941, MoMA\u2019s great founding director, Alfred Barr, famously drew a diagram of the museum\u2019s ideal permanent collection as a torpedo. (It was while World War II was raging, after all.) The tail is C\u00e9zanne, van Gogh, and Seurat. Barr surmised that after 1950, art would come only from America and Mexico. His curatorial successor, Bill Rubin, tripled down on all of it. Except Mexico, of course.\n\nNow the museum is getting rid of the strict timeline. It\u2019s getting rid of movements. Good! Measuring things that way does a disservice to art and to artists \u2014 as Willem de Kooning said, \u201cIt is disastrous to name ourselves.\u201d MoMA will be hanging works from different eras, and different places, next to one another, opening up what had begun to seem like an airless, self-referential canon into something much more dynamic. The museum is even discarding its 89-year aversion to showing different mediums together. As a geezer, I relish back-to-back galleries of killer paintings, but it\u2019s fitting to stop showing art in only this way, in part because the new strategy allows us to go back and ask new questions of work we thought we understood, and in part because it\u2019s how artists themselves see art history, today especially \u2014 not as a timeline of progress but as a beautiful trash heap or costume shop in which to play. (In the age of the internet, with a globalized art world and the breaking down of at least some barriers to entry, this probably isn\u2019t too surprising.)\n\nMost exciting of all, MoMA\u2019s permanent collection will no longer be a static thing. Every six months, a third of it will be reinstalled. I presume the twin peaks of Picasso and Matisse will always be on display somewhere along with other trophy works and big names. But there will be many more names, too, belonging to people less well known, less than a century old, less white, less male, and less exclusively American and European. This means that every 18 months, MoMA will be entirely new. If you\u2019re irked with the way the collection looks now, come back in six months \u2014 you never know. Good-bye, canon! At least the static, eternal, Old Testament teleological one we all grew up with. In 2004, when MoMA reopened in a then-new glass-and-steel campus, only 5 percent of the art on view in the permanent collection was by women. Today, the museum estimates that 28 percent of the works on view are by women, and 21 percent by artists outside of Western Europe, the U.S., and Canada \u2014 that\u2019s gigantic for MoMA, modernism, and art.\n\n\u201cThis past five to ten years is the most change-making, radical rethinking of art history and, by extension, museum curation in a half-century,\u201d said Ann Temkin, the chief curator of painting and sculpture, in a lecture. \u201cThings that were assumed over the last 40, 20, ten, or even five years have exploded.\u201d Amen.\n\nSo \u2014 what was assumed? Let\u2019s look at five big things.\n\nFirst, there was Ezra Pound\u2019s cri de coeur \u201cMake it new.\u201d In modernism, only newness was given value. Everything old was considered pass\u00e9, inadequate to address the times, which meant modernism claimed not just a monopoly on newness but also on importance. One Dadaist said, \u201cArt is dead.\u201d Case closed.Of course, all art was once new. Cave painters painted over older cave paintings; Roman pots sport artist signatures like \u201cNo one could ever make a grain pot as good as this.\u201d It\u2019s the same way each generation thinks it has invented sex; newness is as old as time. The modernists were just a lot cockier about saying so.\n\nSecond, modernism called itself reality. Which meant, perversely, it didn\u2019t have to bother to address or depict actual reality \u2014 instead, it offered itself as the only thing that mattered. Kandinsky wrote, \u201cRealism = Abstraction. Abstraction = Realism.\u201d American critic Clement Greenberg said art was meant to \u201cundeceive the eye.\u201d Much modern art turned away from the world and into itself while denying subject matter and narrative altogether. At least the importance of subject matter, since much modernism employed traditional (not \u201cnew,\u201d hello!) subject matter: nudes, landscapes, still lifes, more nudes, everyday scenes, nature, architecture, and more nudes. What an artist had to render new was how these things looked. Viewers were expected to look through subject matter. You weren\u2019t seeing a landscape; you saw how this artist reinvented the landscape. By the end of the 20th century, Gerhard Richter even said he was \u201cindifferent\u201d to subject matter (he painted Nazis, terrorists, and 9/11, of course). Much of this means the world modernism gives you is the world of the artist\u2019s studio\u2014and optical shoptalk. This is what allowed artists to make squiggles, squares, rectangles, pictures of violins, color arrangements, street scenes, and naked ladies even during the carnage of World War I and World War II. By the time I was trying (and failing) to enter the art world in the 1970s, painting was supposed to be only about itself, its materials, and \u201cflatness.\u201d\n\nThird, modernism was built on the principle that formal experimentation is the only thing that matters. The doctrine can\u2019t be emphasized enough. Every artist had to create his [sic] own forms and world. These forms had to follow visual strictures: Art had to be seen all at once, not sequentially or with any formal hierarchy. (That meant it couldn\u2019t have narrative.) Think of how you see all of a Pollock at once, even though it has parts and details. Similarly, you weren\u2019t supposed to be able to separate process and material, just as we see medieval mosaics as image, color, surface, process, and material all at the same time and as one thing. Modernism was philosophically colonialist this way and loved declaring everything as its own, all while asserting it was inventing even those things it was stealing.\n\nFourth, there was the principle that modern art would \u201ckill history\u201d \u2014 a hysteria of finality. Modernism was born in the immediate wake of and during multiple revolutions, mass industrialization, and colonial empires, and inventions like photography, movies, flight, automobiles, X-rays, and Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity. Duchamp said painting should \u201cavoid all contact with traditional\u201d art. In wanting to destroy the whole history of Western art, modernists were like an aesthetic Taliban. Except for the art they approved of, everything else was deemed bourgeois, Establishment, bad taste, or kitsch.\n\nWhen Americans took up the mantle with Abstract Expressionism, they were no less absolutist. They had not seen their previous culture destroyed by war, but they were still modernists. Barnett Newman said American artists had to \u201cstart from scratch.\u201d Ad Reinhardt said, \u201cI am merely making the last painting which anyone can make.\u201d History didn\u2019t exist unless you were making it. (It\u2019s always the end-times again in modernism.)\n\nFifth, there was modernism\u2019s grand teleology \u2014 the whack-rationalist idea that history was to proceed in a predefined order. If you didn\u2019t fit, know, or care, or were a visionary, an artist of color, or female, tough luck. Only the things in its timeline were deemed progress. Progress was to be the goal of all art.\n\nFor those actually living modernism, though, the whole project was way messier and more rivalrous than could ever be reduced to any set of principles. After all, before MoMA got its hand on modernism, it wasn\u2019t propaganda. It was just art. Which means: It was a lot of different, competing propagandas.\n\nIn fact, modernism was more like a wrestling match of competing egos vying for top-dog status, each saying he\u2019d replaced or repudiated the previous one. Picasso was against abstraction. (What a pill!) Mondrian wrote, \u201cCubism did not accept the logical consequences of its own discoveries.\u201d His goal? \u201cPure plastics.\u201d (I\u2019m still not sure what this means.) Russian Suprematist high priest Kazimir Malevich demanded \u201cvictory over the sun\u201d and \u201cthe supremacy of pure feeling.\u201d (What?) In 1912, Duchamp said, \u201cPainting is over.\u201d In 1921, Constructivist Aleksandr Rodchenko said, \u201cI have reduced painting to its logical conclusion \u2026 I affirmed it\u2019s all over.\u201d (Hello, Doctor Death.) Duchamp did, however, muse, \u201cCan one make works of art that are not \u2018works\u2019 of art?\u201d (I love that!) Then Greenberg called Duchamp \u201csub-art.\u201d What a bully!\n\nThe \u201cPope of Surrealism,\u201d Andr\u00e9 Breton, \u201cexcommunicated\u201d heretics like Alberto Giacometti and, in 1934, put Dal\u00ed \u201con trial.\u201d (God complexes and control freaks are a modernist feature, not a glitch.) Minimalist Judd opined that with the \u201creadymade,\u201d Duchamp had invented fire but didn\u2019t do enough with it. Much later, Duchamp said contemporary artists \u201cno longer make pictures; they make checks.\u201d Soon Chris Burden and Richard Prince made art out of checks. Now artists make art out of Prince.\n\nThings have come a long way since the Armory Show of 1913 \u2014 that\u2019s the true genesis of all that might be called modern art in America and the first in-depth look Americans got at European modernism. In New York, 85,000 people attended; in Chicago, attendance was 188,000. American salon impresario Mabel Dodge wrote to Gertrude Stein that in New York, the show was \u201cthe most important public event \u2026 since the signing of the Declaration of Independence\u201d and added that \u201cthings will never be the same afterwards.\u201d She was right. One New York critic wrote, \u201cAmerican artists did not so much visit the exhibition as live at it.\u201d Albert Barnes, Henry Frick, and the Met bought works. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say the founding of MoMA stems from those 27 earthshaking days in New York.\n\nAt the time, the impact could be measured most by the resistance. Traditionalists protested that the show was like \u201cvisiting a lunatic asylum.\u201d Matisse was burned in effigy. Teddy Roosevelt said the art was \u201crepellent from every standpoint\u201d and asserted there was \u201cno reason why people should not call themselves Cubists, or Octagonists, or Parallelopipedonists, or Knights of the Isosceles Triangle \u2026 one term is as fatuous as another.\u201d Duchamp\u2019s Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2 was the most scandalous work in the show. In newspapers, it was derided as Rush Hour in the Subway and Explosion in a Shingle Factory.\n\nThat the masses might mock avant-garde art is so familiar today it\u2019s hard to believe no one had bothered to do it before modernism (though it had happened in the rarefied air of the French and English salons). But why would anyone have bothered before? Until modernism, no art movement had ever made anything as totalizing and threatening as the proposition modernism did: that art would remake the world.\n\nIt did, and it didn\u2019t. First, in America modernism would have to be reimagined. By 1948, Newman was painting stripes and monochromatic fields of bright color on large canvases. Pollock began to drip in 1947. \u00c9migr\u00e9e Peggy Guggenheim opened the Art of This Century Gallery, exhibiting both European modernists and starving, struggling Americans, among them Clyfford Still, William Baziotes, Alexander Calder, Adolph Gottlieb, Joseph Cornell, Robert Motherwell, de Kooning, and Mark Rothko. She gave Pollock his first solo show in 1943. A new game was in the offing: America claiming the European avant-garde as its own imperial patrimony.\n\nThe values of Abstract Expressionism included enormous scale, the male painter alone in the arena painting in pursuit of total abstraction (except for de Kooning \u2014 who Pollock said \u201cbetrayed it\u201d). These artists embraced myth, the sublime, transcendence, existential and spiritual terror, cosmic light and darkness, and all that hocus-pocus. And celebrity. Soon, Pollock was featured in Life magazine in the act of painting and smoking. All looked rosy.\n\nAbstract Expressionism restarted modernism wonderfully, but the movement quickly died another death. In 1953, 27-year-old Robert Rauschenberg arrived at de Kooning\u2019s studio with a bottle of liquor in trade for a drawing he said he\u2019d erase. De Kooning\u2019s best biographers, Mark Stevens and Annalyn Swan, call this rendezvous \u201ca ghostly Greek messenger come to warn the king of hubris.\u201d De Kooning said, \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and granted the request.\n\nThat same year, Rauschenberg and composer-artist John Cage made Automobile Tire Print, a long, narrow strip of paper on which Cage had driven a car, leaving a long track in black ink. All this was a direct attack on the life-or-death gravitas of Abstract Expressionism \u2014 and indeed all of modernism. Art would soon be riven with irony, something that had left it for some time. These ironies multiplied all over the world for the next decades. In 1956, the first Pop Art show took place in London. In Europe, Yves Klein and Piero Manzoni were ascendant. 1957 brought the most political international postwar art movement of them all: Situationism, which railed against personality-based individualism and asserted that art is determined by real-world conditions and situations. Artists today still work from that premise.\n\nThe coup de gr\u00e2ce came on January 1, 1958. Target With Four Faces garnered the cover of the No. 1 art magazine of the time, ArtNews. The work was by 27-year-old unknown Jasper Johns. Three weeks later, this change lurched into hyperspeed when Johns\u2019s debut solo show opened at Leo Castelli\u2019s new fourth-floor gallery at 4 East 77th Street, and American art turned on a dime. MoMA acquired three works from the show and arranged for a fourth, Flag (for $900), to be purchased as a gift for the museum. All are now modernist icons. A new world was released.\n\nAnd while many of the younger artists were still white and male, something nevertheless new came to the fore: Many of them were gay. All held views diametrically opposed to the lofty art values they\u2019d been schooled in.\n\nThey painted smaller, figuratively, employed subject matter non-spontaneously, were uninterested in spiritualism or strict formal things like \u201cflatness,\u201d the sublime, or cathedrals of selves, and even violated the sacrosanct surfaces of their art by attaching real objects to them. (Ed Ruscha and Robert Indiana painted paintings of words.) Like all artists after them, they were formalist and anti-formalist, sincere and ironic, at the same time. (The latter is a condition of life.) These artists didn\u2019t turn away from but embraced the mass culture around them. They brought life back into art. All of it was intentional. Rauschenberg said he and Johns \u201cused to start each day by having to move out from Abstract Expressionism.\u201d\n\nThese innovations were important, of course. Yet in attacking their modernist forebears, the Pop artists were also affirming the reign of their ideology. In 1961, Robert Smithson wrote, \u201cI am a Modern artist dying of Modernism.\u201d He was right. Pop Art and minimalism were derived from mass taste, sources, and material and were ironic, but they were also committed to making it new, to the idea of the work of art as a closed perfect space, to formal experimentation and innovation above all else, to repudiating previous art history, and to the conception of art as a teleological project. And, of course, it shocked your nana.\n\nWhat will it be like to live without the old modernist canon? I expect thrilling and scary. I don\u2019t want Picasso and the rest to go away. And of course they won\u2019t \u2014 we can\u2019t forget these titans, even as we rehang and reconsider their work every year.\n\nBut here\u2019s how art has already moved on. Modernism is now just part of art history to artists, and not even the only or best part. Artists are ranging through history, happy to make things new by returning to older unused, overlooked art. I\u2019ve seen countless artists deploy Cubism and Post-Impressionism in ways that make the Ur-modernist movements just another segment of the aesthetic double helix. Artists like Jenna Gribbon, Louis Fratino, Carroll Dunham, Sarah Peters, and Jonathan Lyndon Chase actually cross the beams of modernism with motives on Greek vases. And it\u2019s not pastiche or gamesmanship. Kerry James Marshall goes all the way back to neoclassical history painting to tell new stories picturing black bodies rather than white heroes.\n\nSubject matter and narrative rise in art everywhere. With a hungry, documenting eye as lucid as Walker Evans\u2019s and Robert Frank\u2019s, photographer LaToya Ruby Frazier photographs working-class American cities and people decimated by toxic environments and jerry-rigged governmental policy. Is her work \u201cdidactic\u201d? It is! In the works of numerous artists, collectives, and collaborations, we\u2019re seeing brilliant portrayals of institutional cruelty. In other words, the real world\u2014and not just as it\u2019s reflected in the artist\u2019s studio. You don\u2019t need a wall label to feel the gut punch. Ditto the set-up photographs of queer quadriplegic Robert Andy Coombs that shows the artist as explicitly sexual with agency and desire. Christine Sun Kim retrofits the charts of strict minimalism and conceptualism to express the rage of her own deaf community.\n\nModernism began in many places at different times. Today, artists aren\u2019t robbing or trying to kill the past. They\u2019re collaborating with it. Instead of only formal experimentation, subject matter and other imaginations have arrived as the electric center of artistic innovation \u2014 narrative, biography, autobiography, history, cultural context, and family trees, all long dismissed as unserious or provincial concerns, have been injected into art. The purities of modernism don\u2019t mean a thing; recent minimalist, monochrome, conceptual art about art feels like artists being junior postmodernists. We may look at them and pass on. Art no longer seems locked in a competitive struggle for artistic supremacy. Except in the market, where it has always been this way.\n\nBut the monolith of modernism is gone. Artists aren\u2019t just crawling into the skins of former styles. They\u2019re consuming, using, changing, and cannibalizing them. Gone is any bullying certainty. We see subjectivity, something like ethics, responsibility, the social contract, personal obsession, and earnest attempts to communicate again with less insider-y audiences. Rather than plotting where this art fits on the teleological-formalist timeline, consider Romanesque and medieval church fa\u00e7ades: These masterpieces tell essential stories in visually sophisticated, visionary ways, all with an extraordinary use of material, scale, ambition, everything, yet anyone may experience, read, grasp, and be part of this art. They are open books. These are the connotations and possibilities of art now. Art has landed on another moon.\n\nWhere does this leave MoMA? Alas, I am not a radical, so I am glad the museum won\u2019t be changing that much. I do not want to destroy MoMA or other museums of modernism (flawed as they are). I still need to return there regularly to commune with the ancestors. Others will don the mantle of fixing and replacing the entire system. If MoMA has a radical love of art rather than a love of the underlying system, it will play a part in the generations to come \u2014 and it may be that future art historians point to this rehanging as a turning point, the central institution of modernism committing to a new set of ideas about what it was, what it represents, and what it offers us today. I say to MoMA, bring out your dead from storage, artists deemed \u201cwrong,\u201d not part of the old story \u2014 put them all on view, let us decide. We all love art. But as James Baldwin wrote, \u201cLove is a battle \u2026 love is growing up.\u201d After a century, we are finally beginning to outgrow modernism.\n\nMoMA Remixed\n\nThe new MoMA will get rid of its strict timelines, its airless taxonomy of movements, and hang works from different eras, and different places, next to one another, in conversation.
