When the team posted a photo of it to Instagram, fans started commenting about how a prominent PopSockets influencer had come up with the idea first \u2014 years ago. \u201c@kimbyrleigha created this first give her her money pleaseeeeeeeeee,\u201d one commenter wrote. Another said, \u201cAnd ur not gonna give her anything ? Not even a dime ?\u201d\n\nThat influencer, who goes by her first name, Kimbyr, loves all phone grips, but she especially loves PopSockets. She\u2019s been making videos about them for years, showing off new designs, teaching people how to properly apply them, reviewing them, and unboxing them. She has 57 videos filed under her PopSockets playlist in which she describes the popular phone attachment as the most \u201camazing and greatest phone accessory of all time.\u201d She says she owns over 400 PopSockets.\n\nPopSockets is well aware of Kimbyr, too. She toured its headquarters in 2018 and helped assemble some PopSockets for a video showing how the company\u2019s creation process works. PopSockets CEO and co-founder David Barnett also emailed her in 2017 to introduce her to a lead PopSockets graphics designer who later facilitated Kimbyr\u2019s relationship with the brand in the form of free products and an open line of communication.\n\nSo Kimbyr was shocked when she read about PopSockets\u2019 plans to expand beyond phone grips and into koozies. The company debuted its PopThirst product last week, which is a cup holder that incorporates a PopSocket for extra grip. She came up with a similar idea for a 2017 PopSockets \u201chacks\u201d video in which she applied a PopSocket to a plastic cup for extra support. The commenters called her the \u201cPopSockets queen.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just find it to be interesting that my video does have like 300,000 views,\u201d Kimbyr says. \u201cPeople did comment on it, and they remember it. It\u2019s burned into their memory.\u201d\n\nOn Instagram, fans tagged her and said she deserved credit. Kimbyr responded to the comments cordially and said that she\u2019ll release a reaction video soon. Her YouTube channel, Kimbyrleigha, has more than 230,000 subscribers. She says she has more than 11 million views on just her PopSockets content.\n\nA PopSockets spokesperson denied getting the idea from her, pointing to a 2015 Instagram post in which the company attached a PopSocket to a mug as evidence that Kimbyr\u2019s idea was not original. \u201cWe love that our fans are enthusiastic about our products, but we are reluctant to call Kimberleigha\u2019s post innovative,\u201d a spokesperson said. They also said the new PopSocket product is \u201cmuch more than our original PopGrip attached to a cup,\u201d calling it \u201cinnovative\u201d and \u201cpatent-pending.\u201d\n\nWhether PopSockets watched Kimbyr\u2019s video or not, the entire situation highlights the complicated relationship influencers have with the products they get involved with as well as the codependence companies and influencers have on each other. In Kimbyr\u2019s case, she loved PopSockets when she discovered the product organically, and so she started making videos about them. As the company gained popularity and people searched for information about them, she became the de facto YouTube expert, and she says her channel grew from 4,000 subscribers to 40,000 subscribers, all from PopSockets content. \u201cPeople thought I owned PopSockets,\u201d she says.\n\nShe created videos that essentially served as customer support, like how to remove and reapply one, and she claims that PopSockets\u2019 team even told her that they showed their own employees her videos to teach them about the product. She says she reached out to PopSockets after realizing that she tapped into an audience that needed attention and answers. Her first PopSockets video has over 500,000 views, while her video about removing and reapplying PopSockets has over 1 million. In general, her PopSockets content performs much better than her other videos, so while PopSockets benefitted from her content in the form of sales and information, Kimbyr and her channel benefitted, too.\n\nKimbyr says she has spent \u201cthousands\u201d of dollars on PopSockets because the company rarely gave her free stuff, and now, after years of making content about PopSockets, she\u2019s at a loss over how they could come up with an idea so similar to hers without any credit.\n\nTight relationships between brands and influencers can be mutually beneficial, but both parties should agree ahead of time on what they\u2019re getting out of the relationship, say leaders at the influencer marketing platform Tagger. \u201cThis protects both the brand and the influencer; the brand has a more active role in what is being said about them, and the influencer can ensure they\u2019ll receive agreed-upon compensation,\u201d says Kelsey Formost, Tagger\u2019s director of content.\n\nInfluencers sometimes feel like they\u2019re part of a brand\u2019s design process because they know the products so well. In Kimbyr\u2019s case, she loved the product, helped sell it, and benefitted from making content about it, but she always wanted a tighter relationship with PopSockets. She says she reached out multiple times in an effort to collaborate with the brand, but she was almost always shot down. The company did increase her affiliate link commission to 25 percent for new customers and 15 percent for repeats to convince her to remove a video in which she compared PopSockets to its competitor Spin Pops. She says she received around $2,600 in affiliate revenue over the three years or so that she was part of the program. Now, Kimbyr views the whole relationship as a catch-22.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t do the videos you don\u2019t get the recognition [from the brand],\u201d she says. \u201cAnd if you do the videos then you\u2019re caught up in this how much do I want to show? Do I want to start using their product in this crazy, innovative way?\u201d\n\nBrands and influencers often mutually benefit from content\n\nFormost says this is another reason brands and influencers should get their relationship in writing, saying it \u201cgives everyone clarification for future collaborations.\u201d That way both parties know how far their relationship goes. \u201cMaking it official means everybody\u2019s protected \u2014 it\u2019s a win-win,\u201d she says.\n\nBrands can be a ticket to YouTube success. A popular product will likely have more search traffic, which means people are more likely to find a YouTuber\u2019s content. It\u2019s Search Engine Optimization 101. But when someone puts an idea on the internet \u2014 especially one based on a product they don\u2019t own \u2014 it\u2019s fair game for everyone else to take and innovate on. PopSockets has the resources to make the PopThirst a real product; Kimbyr doesn\u2019t.\n\nKimbyr says after this incident and after gaining more experience in the brand space, she doesn\u2019t share her ideas freely. If she comes up with something that might be worth money, she\u2019ll reach out to a lawyer and look into patenting it, or she\u2019ll collaborate with a brand to make it a reality. She currently works with a PopSockets competitor, Nuckees, which she says pays her a contractor fee to come up with ideas. It\u2019s planning to release a phone grip with lip gloss built-in and another one that incorporates aromatherapy. She hasn\u2019t forgotten about PopSockets, though.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sad \u2014 that\u2019s my ultimate feeling inside,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like losing a boyfriend. It feels like I lost a relationship.\u201d", "description": "YouTuber Kimbyrleigha claims that PopSockets stole her idea for a koozie with a PopSocket attached, which the company is now calling a PopThirst.
