FILE PHOTO: Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive Akbar Abbas Al Baker attends an interview with Reuters in St. Petersburg\n\nBy Liz Lee\n\nLANGKAWI, Malaysia (Reuters) - Qatar Airways said it may convert its 10 orders for the Boeing Co (N: ) ultra-long-range 777-8 widebody jet to the larger 777-9, depending on the performance of the 777-9.\n\n\"If the 9 is performing very close to the parameters that the 8 will operate, yes we may convert the 8 to 9,\" Qatar Airways CEO Akbar al-Baker told Reuters on the sidelines of an event to launch a new route from Doha to Langkawi.\n\nEmirates and Qatar Airways are the only firm customers for the 777-8 model, which Boeing is also trying to sell to Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd (AX: ) for record-long commercial flights from Sydney to London.\n\nThe date of entry into service for the 777-8 will depend partly on customer demand, a Boeing executive said on Wednesday, after the U.S. manufacturer in August said plans for first deliveries in 2022 would be delayed.\n\nThe 777-9 is due to make its first test flight in 2020.\n\nQatar Airways also has 50 777-9s on order and will maintain 60 orders for the 777X family in total even if it converts some to the larger model, al-Baker said.\n\nEmirates has 35 of the 777-8 model on order but its president, Tim Clark, has said some of its 150 orders for 777X family planes could be switched to 787s.", "description": "Qatar Airways says may convert orders for Boeing 777-8 jet to 777-9", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9G09V-OCABS_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
