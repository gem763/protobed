She is also claiming damages over allegations that the newspaper did not handle her personal information correctly under data protection legislation and breached copyright laws by publishing large chunks of the letter without her permission.\n\n\u201cAlthough the claimant is well known to the public, the details of her feelings about her relationship with her father are not a matter of public interest, nor do they relate to her public profile or work,\u201d her lawyers state.\n\nHer husband, Prince Harry, last month warned of newspapers \u201cwaging campaigns against individuals with no thought to the consequences\u201d and compared the treatment of Meghan to coverage of his mother, Princess Diana. He also launched legal proceedings against the publishers of the Sun and the Mirror for alleged phone hacking, as part of the couple\u2019s all-out legal war on the UK\u2019s tabloid media.\n\nMeghan wrote to her father in August 2018 begging him to stop talking to reporters and saying he had broken her heart \u201cinto a million pieces\u201d with his constant media interventions during her relationship with Prince Harry. The letter was posted via FedEx by Markle\u2019s Los Angeles-based representative.\n\nEarlier this year Thomas Markle handed the letter to the Mail on Sunday, which ran excerpts of the correspondence as a \u201cworld exclusive\u201d, alongside his comments about being cut out of the relationship with his daughter.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday has stood its ground since the first legal letters were sent in February, with the case currently heading to court. After the existence of the legal action was revealed, the Mail on Sunday ran a staunch defence of its reporting, saying Thomas Markle had originally intended to keep the existence of the letter private.\n\nAccording to Markle, he decided to go public after reading a lengthy piece in the February edition of the US magazine People, with quotes attributed to \u201cclose friends of Meghan\u201d, which the royal household has never denied was authorised by the duchess.\n\nHe said it misrepresented the reality: \u201cI decided to release parts of the letter because of the article from Meghan\u2019s friends in People magazine. I have to defend myself. I only released parts of the letter because other parts were so painful. The letter didn\u2019t seem loving to me. I found it hurtful.\u201d\n\nThe Mail on Sunday has always maintained that it did not edit the letter in any way that changed its meaning. The newspaper has also made clear that it did not pay Thomas Markle when he provided the letter to the newspaper.\n\nMeghan also decided to abandon the law firms traditionally used by the royal family and employ the services of reputation management specialists, Schillings, who pride themselves on fiercely representing their clients and often keep stories out of the newspapers.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday declined to comment.", "description": "Duchess of Sussex is suing Mail on Sunday for copyright infringement and invasion of privacy", "authors": ["Jim Waterson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3325223ed7fc635bf61818a3b8a0c148e854cbba/0_69_2079_1247/master/2079.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=36c3d1a769377202854380426bb371f1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
