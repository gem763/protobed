They haven\u2019t opened a season with back-to-back road wins in 30 years.\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s previous 2-0 start occurred in 2012, coincidentally the last time it visited Youngstown State. Current 49ers CEO Jed York was raised in the city and longtime owners the DeBartolo-York family are synonymous with the Mahoning Valley.\n\n\u201cOur owners are from here and they\u2019ve opened up everything for us, so we\u2019re enjoying it,\u201d cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost been like normal with the same shing-ding we do in Santa Clara, except having to get up when it\u2019s like 4 in the morning at home. But even that\u2019s good because we\u2019ll be ready for it when we get to Cincinnati.\u201d\n\nUniversity officials welcomed the 49ers to campus, giving them locker rooms at Stambaugh Stadium, access to their weight-training area and the ability to hold three practices at their soccer and outdoor track stadium.\n\nThough the Penguins compete at the FCS level, their athletic facilities are on par with many mid-major NCAA programs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told some of the guys, this isn\u2019t your normal Division I-AA looking school, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo said. \u201cI\u2019ve been to a number of them and the stadium, weight room, whatever we\u2019ve seen here, it\u2019s pretty impressive. The whole week, it\u2019s been good.\u201d\n\nThe business trip also has been a homecoming for fullback Kyle Juszczyk, a high school football standout at Lodi Cloverleaf, located 75 miles to the west in a largely rural community.\n\nThe three-time Pro Bowl selection met his brother for lunch on San Francisco\u2019s day off and has been his teammates\u2019 go-to guy with questions about the myriad differences between Ohio and the congested Bay Area.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been joking about there being every kind of chain restaurant here, how far apart everything is spaced and the amount of farmland they\u2019ve seen,\u201d Juszczyk said. \u201cI\u2019ve had to stick up for myself a lot, but it\u2019s been a nice opportunity for all of us and it\u2019s always nice to come home.\u201d\n\nThe 49ers will check out of their hotel in suburban Boardman on Friday morning, then practice for the final time at Youngstown State before boarding a mid-afternoon flight to Cincinnati.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be surprising if Garoppolo stops at his new favorite ice cream parlor or tight end George Kittle picks up a box of chicken on their way out of town.\n\n\u201cYoungstown State has been awesome and the Holiday Inn has been incredible, just a great week,\u201d Iowa product Kittle said, breaking into a smile. \u201cThe best part of being back in the Midwest is you have every chain restaurant you could imagine here. Now, I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ve eaten at them all, but it\u2019s nice just to know they\u2019re there for you.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Rookie DE Nick Bosa (high right ankle sprain) did not practice for the second straight day, but defensive coordinator Robert Saleh said he could play against the Bengals. The No. 2 overall pick sat out the preseason with the injury and had a sack at Tampa Bay. \u201cHe\u2019s working with the performance staff trying to get ready for Sunday, so we\u2019ll see,\u201d Saleh said. \u201cNick is a football junkie, so I know he\u2019s going to look hard at the tape from last week. I\u2019m sure his pops also looks at the tape and I\u2019m sure his brother (Chargers DE Joey Bosa) will look at the tape.\u201d \u2026 WR Jalen Hurd (back), RB Tevin Coleman (ankle), WR Trent Taylor (foot) remain out. S Jimmie Ward (right ring finger surgery) was limited.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Richard Sherman wasn't overly enthused when he learned the San Francisco 49ers were spending an entire week in Ohio.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brian Dulik"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
