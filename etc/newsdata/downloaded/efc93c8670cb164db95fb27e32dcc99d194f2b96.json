Details of the rematch were revealed Tuesday afternoon on social media.\n\nThe November 9 fight follows a previous match between the two that took place in August 2018 and ended in a draw. But the match was a success in drawing crowds: 18,000 fans watched the fight on-site in a United Kingdom arena, and nearly 800,000 people tuned in online to stream the event. That boxing match generated $11 million in revenue, according to estimates from Business Insider.\n\nRead more: KSI and Logan Paul probably generated up to $11 million with their YouTube boxing match\n\nPaul and KSI have been immensely hyping up the rematch ever since the previous one did not result in a winner. The rematch was initially scheduled for February, and it's not clear why it was pushed back all the way to November. Medium publication FFWD reports that there were 10 months of negotiations about rights and brand deals leading up to this rematch.\n\nThis time around, the match between Paul and KSI is being promoted by Matchroom Boxing and will stream exclusively on DAZN, a livestreaming app for sports. But it remains to be seen how DAZN fairs in trying to stem the surge of free streams that are bound to pop up online during the match. An estimated 1 million people watched the 2018 match via illegal streams on websites like Twitch.\n\nAdditionally, this time around, the Paul-KSI can be classified as a \"professional\" match rather than an amateur one, because both men are licensed by the California State Athletic Commission, FFWD reports. That also means that Paul and KSI won't be wearing headgear for this boxing match.\n\nTickets are not yet on sale, but are expected to be available soon on the Staples Center website.", "description": "This is a rematch of a previous bout last August between the two, which ended in a draw and generated an estimated $11 million in revenue.", "authors": ["Paige Leskin"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6ec0fc2e22af0ea12b7ba2-1920-960.jpg"}
