The crates are used over and over again, even after spillages. Most, if not all, are dirty, from food, and things like smashed eggs.\"\n\nAnother driver told the programme they are so concerned about poor hygiene, they are worried about their own family eating food from the crates.\n\nAsda said the findings were \"isolated examples and the opinion of individual colleagues\".\n\nImage caption A reporter witnessed spillages but was told by drivers that there was no need to clear it up during the delivery round\n\nIt added: \"The findings do not reflect the extensive policies and training they have in place, which are supported by independent third party audits.\"\n\nThe supermarket also says Watchdog's researcher did not receive the full role-specific training because he didn't do enough shifts.\n\nIn July, Asda announced it was removing the option to choose to have carrier bags with Home Delivery and Click & Collect orders.\n\nThe removal of bags means some food items are placed directly into crates, which Watchdog's investigation has found are not always clean.\n\nWatchdog's undercover researcher saw delivery crates left on grassy and wet ground, going against Asda's own rules and risking bacterial contamination.\n\nThe company said it delivered almost half a million orders each week, using their totes more than 2.5 million times, and it was inaccurate and misleading to suggest that it did not have policies or training in place at a business level.\n\nA previous Watchdog investigation highlighted hygiene concerns at Asda and its home delivery service.\n\nAsda told the programme back in 2016 it would permanently improve standards across its home delivery service, including providing every driver with a spillage kit.\n\nThese processes were not being followed at the store where Watchdog went undercover.\n\nImage caption Crates are used over and over again, even after spillages\n\nChartered environmental health practitioner Barrie Trevena said: \"Even if the food you're putting in is wrapped, the packages then become contaminated and then when the customer handles the cans and the packages, then that's going to contaminate their worktop and fridge.\"\n\nPresenter Steph McGovern said: \"Asda need to sort this out, they've had years to do it.\"\n\nAsda said: \"We would like to reassure customers that food safety is their number one priority.\"\n\nIt added that it took every complaint seriously and was disappointed by Watchdog's findings, but it was confident in the cleaning and hygiene policies and processes \"to uphold the high standards our customers rightly expect from Asda\".\n\nYou can watch the full investigation on Thursday 19 September at 20:00 BST on BBC One or on iPlayer afterwards.", "description": "A BBC undercover investigation reveals poor hygiene at the supermarket's home delivery service.", "authors": ["Assif Majid", "Bbc Online"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10EA6/production/_108868296_asda_190919_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
