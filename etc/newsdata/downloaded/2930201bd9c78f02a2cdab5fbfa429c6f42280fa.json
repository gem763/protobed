However, this was only the beginning of her suffering, as her real nightmare would start the following year.\n\n\u201cI went to visit my mother\u2019s family and there happened to be a funeral going on at the time. Due to this, my cousin, who was eight months pregnant at the time, and I had to sleep at family relatives due to a lack of space.\n\n\u201cAt about midnight, four men barged into the hut we were sleeping in and instructed that we be quiet,\u201d said Mayekiso.\n\nThe four armed men took their possessions before proceeding to repeatedly rape her at knife point.\n\n\u201cAfter they asked us to undress, they played with my cousin\u2019s pregnant belly and I asked them to let her go and hurt me instead.\n\nTo this they responded that I thought I was clever and took turns raping me both vaginally and anally, while pointing this big knife at me, daring me to be quiet,\u201d Mayekiso said.\n\nFollowing the traumatic ordeal, Mayekiso says she experienced victimisation at the police station as well as at a public health centre while trying to report the matter with officials, who ridiculed her for being raped by four men.\n\n\u201cWhen I went back to university I felt like I was dreaming, I was still in disbelief and shock. I told Mr Qotoyi, my psychology lecturer, and he gave me counselling. He saved my life from self-doubt and I wrote my exams. I passed all my modules, which was a miracle as I was already left with only one week of exams when the incident happened.\u201d\n\nShe said court proceedings the following year were even worse with \u201cthe same humiliation and grilling inside the court room\u201d and, without adequate counselling and with constant postponements, she and her cousin became despondent about attending the case, which was withdrawn after a draining year of court attendances.\n\n\u201cIt was hard living knowing that my rapists were roaming free in my community and might continue to hurt more people, so I decided to use my experience to heal more survivors,\u201d said Mayekiso.\n\nApart from her work with the SAPS, where she says she works to advocate change in the system, Mayekiso also motivates young women from all over the country who are survivors of abuse though various platforms.\n\nShe also runs a Whatsapp group, called Unbreakable, which attained over 30 members in a week, primarily survivors of divorce, HIV, gang rape and other abuses. Through the group, she not only heals others but has found her own healing as well.\n\n\u201cWhat I would like to say to all women out there who have been raped but kept quiet, and even felt rape and HIV is a death penalty, is that it all starts from within.\n\nAs women, you are so uniquely manufactured by God and when God manufactured you he used original parts not fake \u2014 that is why I conquered,\u201d said Mayekiso.\n\n\u201cOur system or constitution is failing women and children as more rights are given to perpetrators.\n\nOur only hope is prayer and supporting each other to prevent each one of us from developing depression or resorting to suicide,\u201d said Mayekiso.", "description": "HIV/Aids and gender activist Zimasa Mayekiso (30) is inspiring women and children through her profession after surviving being gang raped by four men at a family home in 2008.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://graph.facebook.com/10227041841/picture", "published_at": "2018-12-07"}
