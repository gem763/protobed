These are welcome, but hard to monitor and can lead to over-supply, prompting grumbles about lack of coordination.\n\n\n\nThere are also fewer entry restrictions than usual on individuals and organizations that want to help, leading to fears of a free-for-all. The Bahamas\u2019 National Emergency Management Agency has acknowledged the frustrations. \u201cThis is a massive operation with many moving parts,\u201d it noted.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Relief aid is offloaded from a Royal Caribbean ship in Freeport, on 11 September.

You\u2019ve got these two main islands that have been affected and lots of keys and off-lying islands where you need to get out to.\n\n\n\n\u201cOften in these disasters you\u2019ll have one point of entry that\u2019s very easy to control: all the aid comes into this airport and that\u2019s where everything is coordinated from. Here, every single day you\u2019ve got private donations, people flying in from the US mainland and from other Caribbean islands and offloading aid, which is great, but how do you then coordinate that? I think that\u2019s the issue.\u201d\n\n\n\nAid work is often an unglamorous case of blocking and tackling. Stacks of bottled water, baby wipes, batteries, medicines, nappies, power generators, snacks, tarpaulins, tools and cat and dog food must be offloaded from planes to trucks and dispersed.\n\nOn Wednesday, Team Rubicon UK delivered portable power generators with fuel to two churches. Charles Ilfrenord, pastor at the pink-walled New Haitian Mission Baptist church, said it would offer relief to the 45 Haitians, including two children, still camped there more than a week after being left homeless.\n\nCharles Ilfrenord, pastor of New Haitian Mission Baptist church.

And now we have power.\u201d\n\n\n\nSome involved in the international aid effort acknowledge the daunting nature of managing a vast operation.\n\nBrian Wilson, team leader for Humanity First, said: \u201cYou\u2019re got a lot of really well-intentioned people, both nationally and internationally, coming here and it makes it really difficult to coordinate that volume of help.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut others express concern about a lack of direction. Dwayne Strawn, an emergency responder trainer from the British Virgin Islands, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more that can be done, that should have been done, that should still be done. I\u2019m not quite sure what didn\u2019t connect. Based on the fact we had a similar disaster in the British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico two years ago, and in the recent past we\u2019ve had a bunch of hurricanes, I think our response should have been a little bit more coordinated and forthcoming.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe official government death toll has risen to 50, but few aid workers on the ground believe that is anywhere close to reality.\n\nStrawn said: \u201cBased on the reports we have heard from people on the ground, it\u2019s going to be way, way more than what the government is reporting. We are ready for closer to thousands.\u201d\n\n\n\nAsked why the government figure is still so low, Strawn added: \u201cMaybe they\u2019re getting the wrong information. I heard somebody said that they don\u2019t want to send the wrong message in terms of tourism; nobody wants to come to a disaster. But I think the sooner we come to terms with what\u2019s happening here, the sooner we\u2019re going to clean it up and get people back here. It\u2019s paradise and we just have to give paradise a hand.\u201d", "description": "Sprawling set of islands provides logistical challenges as people from US and Caribbean islands offload supplies", "authors": ["David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfb713b4fdc961d63dc39e6ac8c14026834d244a/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bca7fbae9de32955d8cf84f3a6b2b2cd", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
