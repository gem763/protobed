So, he was saying that they must stop destabilising the rest of us, who want to make things work.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, Zille had told City Press\u2019 sister publication, Rapport, that she had been approached to form a new liberal party following the May 8 polls, but she had told the group that there was still a window to save the party.\n\nShe argued that breaking away was no small feat and would have to come as a last-ditch attempt.\n\nThe comments to Rapport were made in the same week in which Zille made a shock announcement that she would be standing for the position of federal council chair.\n\nThis week, when asked by City Press if her failure to secure the job would be the signal for the formation of the breakaway party, the former leader did not rule out the possibility.\n\n\u201cIt would be completely wrong for me to go into an election like that, making out as if I am blackmailing people: \u2018If you don\u2019t vote for me, then I am going.\u2019 No. I love the DA and I love its project for South Africa, and I have invested my whole adult life into building this party,\u201d she said as an initial response.\n\n\u201cIf the DA stops being that kind of a party \u2013 which I hope it won\u2019t stop being \u2013 if it does, it won\u2019t be my party any more because I do not support a person or a party but a set of values and ideas. And up until this point, the DA has been the carrier of those values and ideas, and I want to make sure that it continues to be the carrier of those values and ideas.\u201d\n\nAsked if Maimane espoused these values, Zille said: \u201cWhen I speak to him he does. Sometimes what I see him quoted as saying in the media makes me ask a few questions, but you never know. When he speaks to me he certainly does.\u201d\n\nPressed for a response on whether or not the DA could have a breakaway party this time next year, she said: \u201cI am never going to say never, but what I am saying is that it is far more important to maintain the DA as the bearer of the values of nonracialism, freedom and fairness.\u201d\n\nMaimane is also said to have spoken strongly about ill-discipline which had crept into the party and had spilt out into the public arena.\n\nThis, he said, confused voters and diluted the message of the party.\n\nLast year, senior leaders were at odds over the party\u2019s redress policy and whether or not race should be used as a proxy. MPs had caused a bloodbath on social media, differing on whether or not the federal council had adopted a new policy \u2013 penned by then policy head Gwen Ngwenya \u2013 which did away with race as a proxy.\n\nIn recent weeks, Maimane has made mention of some party members pushing to limit the DA to being a gathering of minorities.\n\nHe warned against this, saying it would be \u201cdamaging\u201d for the country, and stressed the need for the party to broaden its appeal \u201cto attract more black South Africans\u201d.\n\nHe also called on the new federal council chair to strictly enforce discipline in the party.\n\nDay one of the federal council congress was dedicated to debating the report penned by a review panel, made up of former party leader Tony Leon, former party chief strategist Ryan Coetzee and Capitec boss Michiel le Roux.\n\nThe three men left shortly after presenting the report yesterday afternoon, leaving delegates to continue their debate.\n\nA draft of the report lamented the state of leadership in the party, saying that it was clear from consultations that not all structures trusted the top brass, and that there was a lack of a clear vision and confusion on the party\u2019s position regarding crucial matters.\n\n\n\nMaimane allegedly appeared to get ahead of the debate on the report when he mentioned in his opening remarks that while the arrangement with the EFF in metros was not ideal, it was a necessary one to chip away at the political monopoly of the ANC.\n\nREVIEW PANEL WARNING\n\nThe review panel\u2019s report warns that getting into bed with the EFF may have been a mistake and that the power wielded by that party was enough to hold governments to ransom.\n\nThe panel recommended that the party seek to get a sense of voters\u2019 opinions on the coalition before making a final decision.\n\nRegarding the culture in the organisation, the panel found that there was a fear of speaking out and rigid communication, which was at times delivered \u201cwith a possible legal challenge in mind\u201d.\n\nIt also found that there was a leaking of internal information and destructive behaviour on social media.\n\nZille\u2019s tweets, as well as Maimane\u2019s tweet on Ashwin Willemse, were flagged as having caused unease among voters.\n\nOther recommendations speak to changes which must be made to structures of the party, such as doing away with certain positions, changing the composition of the national management committee, and reassessing the functions of the chief executive officer (CEO) as well as the manner in which the federal legal commission does its work.\n\nFUTURE HANGS IN THE BALANCE\n\nMaimane\u2019s future continues to hang in the balance.\n\nCity Press reported last week that the panel had recommended that he step down alongside CEO Paul Boughey.\n\nThe CEO threw in the towel on Thursday, announcing that he would resign from his post.\n\nMaimane has remained adamant that he will not resign, despite the call for him to do so.\n\nCity Press reported last week that he allegedly told his allies that he would resign if Zille were to emerge as federal council chair.\n\nIt is understood that a number of people have also proposed to the party leader that he announce at this weekend\u2019s sitting that he will not be seeking re-election at what is likely to be an early congress next year.\n\n\u201cHe can, at the very least, buy himself a year and figure out what his next move is in that time, without being under pressure. So, it is a win for him and for the party,\u201d one of Maimane\u2019s allies said.\n\nEARLY CONGRESS\n\nBoth the review panel and Maimane have made the call for an early congress.\n\nNational spokesperson Solly Malatsi told the media yesterday that the leader had also called for a policy congress ahead of the elective one.\n\nMalatsi confirmed that it would be possible for the federal council to defer the decision on the adoption of the review panel\u2019s report \u2013 and any amendments to it \u2013 to a later stage, once structures had been consulted on its findings.\n\nA number of delegates told City Press that they would argue that although the federal council had the power to make the call, it should hold off on adopting the report and allow for leaders to take the findings to lower structures to give their input.\n\n\u201cIf we do not adopt the report now, we can buy enough time to see how the voting for the chairperson will go. That will give some of us a sense of which direction to take regarding the findings and also our futures,\u201d a delegate said.\n\nVoting for the new chairperson is set to take place this morning.", "description": "DA leader Mmusi Maimane has dared those threatening to form a breakaway party to take their leave if they no longer identify with the party\u2019s \u201cproject\u201d.", "authors": ["S Thembile Cele"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9495/7b2465d08ffd442bb1c64ce4d1d5a332.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
