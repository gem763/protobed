The states that are important in 2020 just happen to also be getting hit hard by the trade war in every sector of their economy.\n\n\u201cStates like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania \u2013 they are agriculture states, but they are also retail states and they have a lot of small businesses, and they also have major manufacturers,\u201d says Matt McAlvanah, spokesman for Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, an alliance of more than 150 associations representing various sectors of the economy. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is that those states are being hit hard and there isn\u2019t any sector of their economy that has been spared.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to launch multiple wars with U.S. trading partners including China, the EU, and Mexico has resulted in roughly $4.9 billion in additional tariff costs so far for these key swing states, according to Tariffs Hurt the Heartland.\n\nThe ongoing trade battle with China stands out as being particularly painful for farmers and businesses \u2013 not to mention consumers.\n\nU.S. soybean exports to China plunged 82% from August 2018 to March 2019 compared to a year earlier, after China imposed 25% tariffs on U.S. goods in retaliation for Trump\u2019s round of tariffs in 2018.\n\n\u201cThe trade war has had enormous costs. We understand that China has been a bad actor, but that exports of farmers and increasing prices for small businesses, should have nothing to do with addressing China\u2019s trade abuses,\u201d says McAlvanah.\n\nAccording to a note from JPMorgan published last month, tariffs are expected to cost American households up to $1,000 a year as the latest round took effect this month.\n\nNaturally, businesses and farmers would prefer a strategy that doesn\u2019t penalize them. Trump has shown no signs of backing down as two new rounds of tariffs are set to hit Chinese imports on Oct. 15 and Dec. 15. Democratic candidates, on the other hand, have failed to articulate a better way. \u201cBoth Democrats and Republicans should be a part of the campaign, providing ideas for how to hold China accountable without making Americans collateral damage,\u201d McAlvanah says.\n\ntariff impact on swing states More\n\nMcAlvanah faults Congress for being absent in the discussion. \u201cThere needs to be a way for Congress to play some sort of oversight role in how tariffs are used. And that\u2019s not something that Congress has been talking about. Congress has not had a role in oversight over how the president uses tariffs,\u201d he says.\n\nHere\u2019s a deeper look at how tariffs have been hurting key swing states, according to recent data by Tariffs Hurt the Heartland.\n\nFlorida\n\nTariffs have cost Florida farmers, businesses, and taxpayers $962 million so far, including $117 million in July. The state\u2019s exports of goods subject to retaliation, including boats, have dropped 46% year-to-date as a result of the $241 million in retaliatory tariffs Florida businesses\n\nOhio\n\nOhio taxpayers have paid $1.1 billion in additional Trump tariffs so far, and $121 million in July. Exports of goods subject to retaliation including gear boxes have fallen 20% year-to-date as the state\u2019s farmers and businesses have faced $599 million in new retaliatory tariffs.\n\nMichigan\n\nMichigan has paid $1.4 billion in tariffs, including $129 million in July. Exports of goods subject to retaliation, including steel pipes, have dropped 6.6% year-to-date as the state\u2019s businesses have faced $561 million in retaliatory tariffs.", "description": "States important in 2020 are also states being hit hard by tariffs in every sector of their economy.", "authors": ["Sibile Marcellus"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ObvOtohieqx4Mi.PAuy7UA--~B/aD0zNzM1O3c9NTYwMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-05/8079a450-7dbc-11e9-9f5f-e79e12418610", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
