The script is well-worn. An assault at a student party; a disorienting walk through hospital clinics and police stations; panic attacks; a forensic examination of your character. How much did you drink? Why did you go to that party? Did you have a stable relationship with your boyfriend? You react by receding further into yourself. Perhaps you drop the charges; perhaps the judge is lenient. Your assailant soon gets on with his life, free to walk the halls of power. Trust the system, you were told.\n\nBut sometimes there are facts that bring you closer to something resembling justice. For a 22-year-old recent university graduate known to the world as \u201cEmily Doe\u201d, there were a few. Fact: Brock Turner, the man who assaults her behind a fraternity house skip in January 2015, is a Stanford University student and swimmer. Spiralling media attention in what is deemed the \u201cStanford swimmer case\u201d means her rape forensic evidence kit receives expedited processing, thus avoiding, she later relates, the fate of a hundred others collecting dust in a slow-moving backlog. Fact: there are two witnesses to the assault, male graduate students who happen to be cycling past. They chase Turner away, and testify in Doe\u2019s favour. Fact: after Turner is found guilty on three felony counts in March 2016, Doe, now 23, writes a powerful 7,000-word letter addressed to her attacker that she reads aloud at his sentencing. It is published on BuzzFeed in June and goes viral, receiving 15m views within a week.\n\nThe letter is read aloud by congresswomen in the House of Representatives and, in response, California\u2019s laws for sexual assault are amended to support future victims. Its opening line is often cited: \u201cYou don\u2019t know me, but you\u2019ve been inside me, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today.\u201d When I first read it, I was also haunted by two other lines: \u201cSometimes I think, if I hadn\u2019t gone, then this never would\u2019ve happened. But then I realised it would have happened, just to somebody else.\u201d What a strange world it is in which 23-year-olds are reflecting on the randomness of the cruelty inflicted on them.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brock Turner leaves the Santa Clara County Main Jail in San Jose, California, 2016. Photograph: Dan Honda/AP\n\nEarlier this month, \u201cEmily Doe\u201d revealed herself to be Chanel Miller, a half-Chinese artist and writer from California. Miller, now 27, looks back at her high-profile sexual assault case in Know My Name. In the three years since the sentencing, she has gathered court transcripts and witness testimonies withheld from her during the case, which inform her memoir. The book blends Miller\u2019s meditations on her life over the past few years with a discussion of the institutions that handle sexual assault cases: the police, the courts, and, in this instance, the university. Courtroom interrogations, ostensibly seeking objective facts, become contests over whose narrative draws the most sympathy. University administrators offer, then withdraw, their support in the face of potential litigation. The neutral faces of institutions, her story shows, so easily slip to reveal highly subjective battles over whose pain counts for what.\n\nThe title of the book denotes declarative self-affirmation, something constantly denied to Miller after she woke up at the Santa Clara Valley Medical Centre in January 2015 with a police deputy and Stanford dean at her bedside. The last thing she remembers is stepping outside the fraternity house with her sister the night before. From then on, her life no longer feels like it is hers. In a daze at the medical centre, she is told there is reason to believe she has been assaulted and signs a stack of papers consenting to an immediate examination. Ten days later, on coming across an article online at work, she learns the full story of what happened to her. She reads of Turner\u2019s life as an \u201cOlympic hopeful\u201d and discovers she is referred to as an \u201cunconscious woman\u201d. This dynamic will carry over into the courtroom, where, she relates, Turner\u2019s ambitions, past accomplishments and present pain are magnified in testimonies from swimming coaches and ex-girlfriends. She, on the other hand, becomes a woman who failed to adequately protect herself against the natural lechery of the world that night in January, her use of alcohol thoroughly questioned. \u201cHis history included his childhood, education, summer jobs, sweet relationships,\u201d she writes. \u201cMy history was blackouts one through five.\u201d\n\nKnow My Name stands unapologetically large, asking others to reckon with its author\u2019s dazzling, undiminishable presence\n\nThe book unveils what those on the outside can\u2019t see. Miller recalls the repeated postponement of her trials, which leaves her schedule agonisingly beholden to someone else\u2019s whims; her recurrent feelings of panic and dread that emerge long after the attack; the rebuilding of her life, as she takes art classes and joins comedy troupes to recover a sense of self. In the midst of all this, she navigates a byzantine legal system, often having to sit in the same courtroom as her attacker. One of the many lessons that comes across is how sexual assault victims need greater guidance through these worlds. When Miller agrees to press charges against Turner, she does so casually over the phone to a detective, right after she is discharged from the hospital. She does not realise what that will entail, thinking it to be the \u201cequivalent to signing a petition\u201d. A year and a half later, Miller is talking to a probation officer about Turner\u2019s sentencing and confuses jail with prison (jail typically holds people awaiting trial or serving short sentences while those in prison tend to be serving longer sentences for more severe offences). She is sure that the officer twists her meaning, playing down the anguish in her testimony to recommend a short county jail sentence for Turner.\n\nWhen it was published in 2016, Miller\u2019s letter stunned readers with the clarity of her voice, acuity of her rage and expansiveness of her empathy towards those in need of support. Her story offered other victims a shared language; Miller recalls receiving thousands of supportive letters from women recounting their own stories. Her memoir has this same mix of the intimate with the communal, placing her own pain against a backdrop of shared suffering. At the end of Turner\u2019s sentencing, she feels as if she has climbed a high mountain of justice, a climb that many fellow victims have not been able to scale. Exhausted, she imagines looking down, \u201cwhere I imagined expectant victims looking up, waving, cheering, expectantly \u2026 What could I tell them? The system does not exist for you.\u201d Against a system that leads victims to recede into their own spheres of private suffering, Know My Name creates a space where this pain can sit and receive support from others.\n\nThe last few chapters discuss the #MeToo movement and its landmark moments: the Harvey Weinstein revelations; the US gymnastics case; Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s testimony in the Brett Kavanaugh hearings. When listening to women tell their stories, Miller stresses, it is important to let them sit with their hurt and anger and resist the urge to pre-emptively tie up their suffering with a bow through platitudes of courage. There is a final irony in how Stanford University, after agreeing to mount a plaque memorialising her story on campus, proposed as the inscribed quote: \u201cI\u2019m right here, I\u2019m okay. Everything\u2019s okay, I\u2019m right here.\u201d (Stanford had rejected Miller\u2019s suggestions, finding them too emotionally charged.) These were the words, she tells us, she told her sister after being released from the hospital, hiding her own panic for her sister\u2019s comfort. Even after cases are concluded, the pain of victims is diminished by the false friend of commemorating one\u2019s bravery. In a world that asks too many survivors to keep their experiences to themselves and shrink their suffering to preserve someone else\u2019s potential, Know My Name stands unapologetically large, asking others to reckon with its author\u2019s dazzling, undiminishable presence. To read it, in spite of everything, inspires hope.\n\n\u2022 Know My Name is published by Viking (\u00a316.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.
