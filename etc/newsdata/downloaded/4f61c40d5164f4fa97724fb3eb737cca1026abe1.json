Nipple-sparing mastectomies are a choice for some, depending on the specifics of the cancer, but others are limited to options like tattooed-on nipples, reconstructions built from, say, leg tissue, or prosthetics that need to be reapplied for each use.\n\nResearch backs up the fact that nipples play a key role in the emotional-recovery process: One recent study, for example, found that women reported significantly higher levels of psychosocial and sexual well-being after a nipple-sparing mastectomy, compared to a total mastectomy.\n\n\u201cThe nipple restores a sense of normalcy and health to a woman,\u201d says Levine. \u201cIt can help her leave the memory of surgery and disease behind her.\u201d\n\nFor patients who can\u2019t keep their nipples, reconstructed, tattooed, or prosthetic options can greatly improve their quality of life. \u201cI\u2019ve seen women who have refused to remove their bras in front of their husbands for years that have no problem whipping off their tops to show off their marvelous breasts today,\u201d says Friday Jones, a tattoo artist who does post-operative tattooing. \u201cIt\u2019s like they finally recognize themselves again.\u201d\n\nHere, five women who have undergone post-mastectomy breast reconstruction share how they dealt with the loss of their nipples\u2014and how it impacted their lives. \u2014Amber Brenza\n\n\u2018Getting my nipples surgically reconstructed was the one part of this process that felt like it was for me.\u2019\n\n\u201cI was only 25 when I was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer, so everything about it\u2014from the diagnosis through my recovery\u2014was a total shock.\n\n\u201cI had a life-threatening diagnosis, so at the beginning, I was so worried about surviving that I didn\u2019t care at all about losing my breasts, much less my nipples. Having a mastectomy was something I needed to do to live, so I did it.\n\n\u201cI chose to have reconstruction surgery for both breasts shortly after my double mastectomy, but I had to wait several months for my previous surgery to heal before I could have nipple-reconstruction surgery\u2014it ended up being three years between my first surgery and when I had my nipples done.\n\n\u201cI was really excited to get the surgery\u2014seeing my new breasts with no nipples was just too weird. But I had to make a lot of decisions I never thought I\u2019d have to think about\u2014like how far I\u2019d want my nipples to stick out.\n\n\u201cMy surgeon used grafts of my own skin from the inside of my upper thigh for the nipple reconstruction. It was incredibly painful\u2014I couldn\u2019t walk for weeks afterward\u2014but totally worth it. The skin from my thigh gradually darkened on its own into the areolas, and the nipples themselves were created by a series of incisions and tucks in the skin and fat.\n\n\u201cWhen I finally saw my new nipples after the bandages came off, I immediately knew I\u2019d done the right thing. Even though there was a lot of healing to do still, I felt like myself again.\n\n\u201cSince my nipple reconstruction, I\u2019ve ended up talking about them a lot. I\u2019ve had conversations about my post-cancer nipples with female acquaintances who were curious about my reconstruction process, I\u2019ve shown them to women who were about to go through their own breast-cancer battle, and I\u2019ve even had to convince more than one well-meaning mother that, no, I really couldn\u2019t breastfeed my child, even though I technically had nipples.\n\n\u201cThese days, I\u2019m super-happy with how my breasts and nipples look; the reconstructive surgeries have given me a lot of peace.\n\n\u201cThe nipple reconstruction was especially gratifying, as it was the one surgery I did just for me. Every other one was because I didn\u2019t want to die, or didn\u2019t want my body to be so messed up. It felt wonderful after years of my life being in the control of the medical community to make a decision that was purely mine.\u201d \u2014Mary Smith, 42, diagnosed at 25\n\nREAD MORE: 11 Symptoms Of Breast Cancer In Women That Aren\u2019t Lumps\n\n\u2018My fake nipples look better than my real ones ever did.\u2019\n\n\u201cI have a long family history of breast cancer, so I decided to get tested. Sure enough, I have the BRCA2 mutation. So in 2017, I chose to have a preventative double mastectomy, followed by reconstruction.\n\n\u201cAt the time, I was told I was a good candidate for nipple-sparing surgery, where they keep your original nipples and reattach them to your new breasts, but that it would involve one extra surgery. I think everyone was surprised when I told them not to bother. Unlike a lot of women, I never had any real attachment to my nipples. In fact, I had always thought they were too big and looked kind of weird.\n\n\u201cEven though I felt no emotional attachment to my original nipples, I wondered if I\u2019d look down after the surgery and feel upset that they were gone.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t miss the old nipples at all, but I wanted to look whole again, and I wanted my breasts to look as natural as possible. So I decided to have nipple-reconstruction surgery.\n\n\u201cI chose to go down a few sizes\u2014from a 34DDD to a 34D\u2014so I knew my boobs were going to look different. The surgeon created new nipples out of little flaps of skin. Then, a few months after that, I got tattoos done on the new nipples to make them look more realistic. My tattoo artist even added little bumps to mimic the glands women have on the areolas.\n\n\u201cThey look so good that my doctor forgot they weren\u2019t real for a minute at my checkup.\n\n\u201cUltimately, I couldn\u2019t be happier with my decision. The one downside is that I don\u2019t have any sensation in my nipples. I do miss feeling aroused there, but my breasts look amazing\u2014better than they did before the surgery.\u201d \u2014Maggie Gaines, 45\n\nREAD MORE: This Woman Documented Her Double Mastectomy In The Most Incredible Way\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll reconstruct my nipples at all.\u2019\n\n\u201cMy experience losing my nipples to breast cancer is hard to put into words.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t a candidate for keeping my nipples, because of the type of cancer I had, and I went through a real grieving process for them\u2014it felt like I was losing an essential part of my femininity.\n\n\u201cAfter I woke up from the mastectomy surgery, I was in so much pain, and all I could see were the drains and expanders and bandages\u2014my body looked like a medical battlefield.\n\n\u201cAt first, it was gut-wrenching, but as I looked at the scars seared across my chest, I realized how strong I really am and that the scars where my nipples used to be were just one more sign of how I\u2019d kicked cancer\u2019s ass and won. That, to me, was worth way more than keeping my nipples.\n\n\u201cAfter my mastectomy, I had several breast-reconstruction surgeries, and currently, I don\u2019t have any nipples\u2014I\u2019m not even sure if I want them at all, tattooed ones or reconstructed ones.\n\n\u201cThis surprises people, but I don\u2019t feel like I need nipples to be sexy. Real men\u2014the kind worth having around\u2014are just happy you\u2019re alive and won\u2019t care about the no-nipples thing.\n\n\u201cBesides, I\u2019ve had a lot of fun trying on \u2018new\u2019 nipples\u2014using pepperonis, whipped cream, cherries, peach candy rings. For me, keeping a sense of humor about everything has been one of the most important parts of my recovery.\n\n\u201cI also have two daughters who may or may not have the same breast cancer gene I have. I want them to know that nipples and breasts are feminine and sacred\u2014but when it comes to cancer, it\u2019s not about saving your breasts, it\u2019s about saving the brave, badass woman underneath them.\u201d \u2014Brooke Parker, 31; diagnosed at 28\n\nREAD MORE: Every Woman Should Know About How Breast Cancer Affects Fertility\n\n\u2018As soon as my nipple prosthetics arrived in the mail, I couldn\u2019t wait to try them on.\u2019\n\n\u201cThere are four generations of breast cancer in my family, so in 2015, after finding two precancerous growths, I decided to have both my breasts removed as a preventative measure.\n\n\u201cI opted for a double mastectomy immediately followed by reconstructive surgery. One year after my mastectomy, I got the final surgery to put my breast implants in, and three months after that, the soonest I possibly could, I had nipple-reconstruction surgery. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t work at all.\n\n\u201cThe surgery didn\u2019t take, and the new nipples totally flattened back out and looked strange\u2014which can sometimes happen after reconstruction, I was told. My surgeon tried to tattoo them so at least the color would give the appearance of nipples, but they just didn\u2019t look real.\n\n\u201cI was devastated. I felt so unattractive that I refused to take my top off during sex and cried to my boyfriend about how awful I felt. I had no self-confidence. Finally, I went to a tattoo artist and had 3-D tattoos done over the ones my surgeon had done. These turned out a lot better, but as great as the tattoos were, my nipples still didn\u2019t stick out at all from my breast, so they didn\u2019t look real.\n\n\u201cThen, I was searching on the Internet one night and came across Pink Perfect, a company that makes prosthetic nipples for women. They had a bunch of different style, size, and color options so I could find a pair that felt right for me.\n\n\u201cAs soon as they arrived in the mail, I couldn\u2019t wait to try them on. They attach with a removable adhesive, and once I stuck them on, they felt totally natural. I ran to my room and put on a tight T-shirt. When I saw my nips poking out through the fabric, I was overjoyed. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt more beautiful than I did in that moment.\n\n\u201cThe nipple prosthetics look unbelievably real. When I went to my follow-up appointment with my plastic surgeon, neither my doctor nor the nurses realized they were fake at first. Now, I wear the prosthetic nipples all the time\u2014to the gym, out running errands, and, yes, during sex. They change my overall look and give me so much more confidence. They\u2019re life-changing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy with my look now, and my health is great. I even found out after my surgery that one of my breasts really did have breast cancer, and I am so lucky we caught it that early.\u201d \u2014Dana Reinke, 45, diagnosed at 42\n\n\u2018Doctors can\u2019t even tell my 3-D nipple tattoos aren\u2019t real.\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had breast cancer twice. The first time, we treated it with chemo and radiation. When it came back two years later, I decided to get a double mastectomy, immediately followed by reconstruction surgery.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t able to do the nipple-sparing surgery on the side with cancer, but I was told I could keep the healthy nipple if I wanted to. I opted to have both removed because I didn\u2019t want them to be mismatched.\n\n\u201cThe first time I saw my breasts after the implant surgery, which followed my mastectomy, I remember thinking how good they looked\u2026except for the lack of nipples. It was a huge shock to see two large, oval-shaped scars where they should have been.\n\n\u201cHonestly, losing my nipples was one of the hardest parts of my cancer. Every time I felt cold or aroused and my nipples didn\u2019t react, it was just another reminder of how much I\u2019d lost to this disease.\n\n\u201cI was desperate to feel normal again, so a year after my breast-reconstruction surgery\u2014as soon as I was healed\u2014I decided to have nipple-reconstruction surgery. My surgeon was a genius, but I was not prepared for what I would see post-surgery\u2014my new nipples looked like raw meat. They were so red and inflamed and were covered in stitches. I\u2019m not sure what I was expecting, but they looked terrible at first.\n\n\u201cCaring for my new nipples was also lot of work. Every day for weeks, I had to put on ointment, cover them with bandages, and then try to figure out a decent outfit I could wear without needing a bra, since I wasn\u2019t able to wear one during the recovery period. It was overwhelming, and even worse, I still wasn\u2019t thrilled with how they looked when they were healed.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t look like ground meat anymore, but they still didn\u2019t look real. The areola was too big, and the color was lighter than the surrounding skin\u2014not darker, how nipples typically look.\n\n\u201cAbout a year later, I decided to get my reconstructed nipples tattooed. It\u2019s unbelievable how realistic the tattoos look. The artist corrected the coloring and added details like shading and dots that look exactly like real nipples. In fact, the last time I went in for a checkup, neither my dermatologist nor my gynae realized they weren\u2019t real.\n\n\u201cToday, I wouldn\u2019t change a thing about my nipples. And interestingly enough, my choice to get both nipples removed turned out to be a life-saving one: When the pathology came back on the \u2018healthy\u2019 nipple, I found out I had a second cancer on the other breast. So now when I look in the mirror, I\u2019m both happy and healthy.\u201d \u2014Jana Muntin, 44, diagnosed at 40\n\nSpecial thanks to Dr. Oren Lerman, for his consultation services.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.womenshealthsa.co.za", "description": "...or if you had nipples at all", "authors": ["Reporting Charlotte Hilton Andersen"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4618/44f4cae26db24b97b7ad2d2e41a5734a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
