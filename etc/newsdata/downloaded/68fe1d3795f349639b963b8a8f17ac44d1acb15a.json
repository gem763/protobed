Like a Geiger counter in a North Korean nuclear-weapons lab, the reaction of the \u201csmart set\u201d on Twitter was wildly disconcerting when Elizabeth Warren announced the results of her spectacularly ill-conceived DNA test earlier this year. At first, the trace amounts of Native American heritage were held up as proof against Donald Trump\u2019s attacks. Then, as geneticists and common sense intervened in the discussion, it became obvious that Warren\u2019s Native American roots were negligible.\n\nAs the social-climbing Warren begins to gain over actual socialist Bernie Sanders, I expect the Sandernistas to unload on the contradictions between the upwardly mobile Left\u2019s hatred of cultural appropriation and the changing racial identity and falsified family history of its darling Warren. If she survives that and wins the nomination, she\u2019ll face a general election in which the same basic problem remains.\n\nI predict that should she make it that far, everyone will just try to change the subject.", "description": "", "authors": ["M.B.
