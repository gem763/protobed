(AP) - The Pittsburgh Penguins are excited for a fresh start.\n\nSidney Crosby and the Penguins became the first team in a generation to win consecutive championships a little more than two years ago. But the Penguins stumbled into an extended offseason last spring when the New York Islanders swept them from the first round of the playoffs.\n\nThat left general manager Jim Rutherford to wonder aloud after the season whether some of his players were too content because they\u2019ve won a couple of Stanley Cups.\n\nCrosby and the Penguins are out to prove that\u2019s not the case.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a certain level of hunger and urgency and desperation you have to have if you\u2019re getting through the playoffs,\u201d Crosby said Friday as the Penguins opened training camp.\n\n\u201cSometimes you think because you have experience that it automatically gives you an edge. It does if you use it, but if you don\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t do much for you.\u201d\n\nCoach Mike Sullivan believes his team can be a championship-caliber group again. But he stressed a daily focus and attention to detail, a brand of intelligent and responsible hockey Sullivan has tried to instill since he took over in December 2015.\n\n\u201cI think this team is capable of doing some real good things,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cBut we have to earn it every day. It\u2019s not inevitable. There\u2019s a nice feeling around the team. I think everyone is excited about the opportunity and possibilities that we have.\u201d\n\nThe Penguins traded winger Phil Kessel to Arizona for Alex Galchenyuk in the offseason.\n\nThe 31-year-old Kessel scored 27 goals and 82 points last season, his fourth with the Penguins. He was a vital part of Pittsburgh\u2019s run to consecutive Stanley Cups, finishing second to Crosby for the 2016 Conn Smythe Trophy, while scoring 18 goals and 45 points, as the Penguins became the first team in nearly two decades to win back-to-back titles.\n\nRutherford spoke of a culture change in the dressing room following the season, and while Kessel is now in Arizona, the Penguins will still need to replace his production.\n\n\u201cPhil produced for us, it\u2019s no secret,\u201d Crosby said. \u201cNobody has to come in here and put up the same stat lines he did. It\u2019s pretty tough to fill those shoes. I think collectively we\u2019re going to have to find ways to make up for that.\u201d\n\nEvgeni Malkin seeks a bounce-back season after the 2012 NHL MVP, and two-time scoring champion, ended a career-worst minus-25 with just 21 goals, his lowest full-season output in almost a decade. The 33-year-old spoke said Friday he wants to be a better leader this season.\n\n\u201cLast year, I\u2019m not happy, for sure,\u201d Malkin said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s a new challenge this year. I want back, my highest level. I can still play at the top level. I want to show everyone I\u2019m not done.\u201d\n\nMalkin skated alongside Galchenyuk and free agent pickup Brandon Tanev on Friday.\n\nThe 25-year-old Galchenyuk has put up five consecutive 40-point seasons, and can play both ends of the ice. The 27-year-old Tanev spent his first four seasons in Winnipeg, and also has a reputation as a strong penalty killer and a hard-working, two-way player. He set career highs with 18 goals and 29 points last year.\n\nPittsburgh also traded for forward Dominik Kahun in the offseason. The 24-year-old played in all 82 games for Chicago in his first NHL season and finished with 13 goals and 37 points. On Friday, Kahun played on a line with Crosby and 24-year-old Jake Guentzel, who scored 40 goals last season.\n\nCrosby and the Penguins are eager to add the new faces into the mix.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s exciting to build an identity and have a fresh start,\u201d Crosby said. \u201cWhen we won, we didn\u2019t sit here talking about June. Just like the fact that we got swept last year, it really doesn\u2019t matter at this point. We\u2019re all starting from the same spot.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Pittsburgh Penguins are excited for a fresh start.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dan Scifo"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/penguins_begin_hockey_77522_c0-126-3000-1875_s1770x1032.jpg?85e3f3a90d2b6cb216aa7875ca9e51bf768c5416", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
