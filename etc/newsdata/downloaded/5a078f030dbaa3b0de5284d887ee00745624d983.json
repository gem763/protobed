Kyle Bass, a prominent investor who\u2019s been a vocal supporter of Hong Kong\u2019s protest movement, lashed out on Monday at U.S. companies and organizations who seem to have struck a \u201cFaustian deal with the devil\u201d to stay in China\u2019s good graces.\n\nAmid a raging controversy surrounding a now-deleted tweet by the general manager of the NBA's Houston Rockets, who voiced support for Hong Kong\u2019s independence, Bass told Yahoo Finance the backlash has put a spotlight on the country political system \u2014 and the companies and entities that apologize so they can do business there.\n\n\"Today, you have this very interesting scenario with the NBA where you're bringing the whole idea of the Chinese Communist Party and their bullying and their influence, and they're exporting their totalitarianism to U.S. soil,\u201d the CIO of Dallas-based hedge fund Hayman Capital Management said.\n\nThe NBA isn\u2019t the only organization to be hit with backlash in China. But Bass said companies apologize or acquiesce to Beijing\u2019s wishes because they're making a \"simple Faustian bargain with the devil, with the Chinese Communist Party.\"\n\nOver the weekend, Rockets general manager Daryl Morey shared an image on Twitter in support of the protesters in Hong Kong that said, \"Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\" Unrest there has grown increasingly violent as the movement becomes more pro-democratic in nature.\n\nMorey\u2019s message went over badly in China, with the state broadcaster CCTV and tech giant Tencent \u2014 the NBA's exclusive digital media partner \u2014 canceling their broadcasts of Houston Rockets games.\n\nEven as Morey tried to walk back his Tweet, the team\u2019s owner and the NBA distanced themselves from what he said. Houston Rockets owner billionaire Tilman Fertitta emphasized that Morey \"does NOT speak for the [Houston Rockets],\" and the team is \"NOT a political organization.\"\n\nSeparately, the NBA issued a statement that recognized Morey's tweet \"deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China\" and that they have \"great respect for the history and culture of China.\"\n\n\u2018Unbelievable\u2019\n\nRiot police chase protesters near a demonstration in Hong Kong, Monday, Oct. 7, 2019.

And, unfortunately, the NBA is in the same camp.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nJulia La Roche is a finance reporter at Yahoo Finance.
