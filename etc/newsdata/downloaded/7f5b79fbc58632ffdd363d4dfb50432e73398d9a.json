Not as happy as they can be because there is still a game to go as we\u2019ve said.\n\n\u201cThe crowds here generally in the World Cup have been fantastic and I thought our supporters on Saturday night were massively instrumental in helping us get home.\n\nJones praised England\u00b4s supporters (Adam Davy/PA)\n\n\u201cTheir singing and their general support of the team has been outstanding. We urge them to keep doing that.\u201d\n\nJones has delivered a major boost to hopes of winning a second World Cup by declaring Jonny May has recovered well from the dead leg sustained in the 19-7 rout of New Zealand.\n\nThe Leicester try machine was touch and go to face the All Blacks because of a hamstring issue and, having recovered from that, he lasted 45 minutes before suffering an additional injury setback.\n\n\u201cWe had a walk through this (Monday) morning and we had to tell Jonny to slow down a bit,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably in better condition than he was last week at this stage. Immeasurably better.\u201d\n\nOwen Farrell also incurred a dead leg in the first-half of arguably the greatest victory in English rugby history but he managed to finish the match, albeit while handing the kicking duties to George Ford.\n\n\u201cOwen\u2019s a bit sore but he\u2019ll be fine. We\u2019ve got a few others carrying bumps and bruises because it was a tough old game,\u201d Jones said.\n\nEngland will on Monday be joined at their Tokyo base by Ben Spencer, the Saracens scrum-half who has been summoned as an injury replacement for hamstring-injury victim Willi Heinz.\n\nHeinz\u2019s tournament is over but he will remain with the squad to help prepare Spencer, who will make his World Cup debut as a replacement in the final.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough for Willi. He\u2019s been a great contributor, a very well-liked member of the squad, and he was in tears in the dressing room,\u201d Jones said.\n\nWilli Heinz has been ruled out of the final (Adam Davy/PA)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough for him but he\u2019s now collected himself and he knows he\u2019s got another role to play for us and he\u2019ll fulfil that role really well this week.\n\n\u201cThe great thing is Willi wanted to stay and we wanted him to stay so it wasn\u2019t a hard discussion. He\u2019s just a great bloke. He works hard for the team.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like when you want to get married. If the lady wants to marry you and you offer to marry, it\u2019s a pretty easy conversation. So it was an easy conversation.\n\n\u201cBen Youngs and him have got a really good relationship and even now he\u2019s already started to mentor Ben Spencer. He\u2019s a really great team man.\u201d", "description": "Wales face a third and fourth placed play-off.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/11/wire-20276986-1572263357-141_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
