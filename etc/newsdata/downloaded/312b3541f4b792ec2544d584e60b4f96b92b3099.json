One of the recent trends has been a move away from small cars and sedans toward bigger, taller, more practical SUVs, with a number of automakers announcing the discontinuation of small, medium and large sedans that had just a few years ago made up the bread-and-butter of their respective lineups. They aren\u2019t all sedans, though, and below we\u2019ll look at many of the cars being discontinued for the coming 2020 model year. As dealers will likely want to clear these lame-duck models from their lots to make room for fresh new products, expect to be able to get a great deal on any of the vehicles on this list.\n\nAudi A3 Cabriolet\n\nThe A3 Cabriolet was introduced here in the U.S. back in 2015 as a 2-door, drop-top version of the A3 sedan. Unfortunately, though, the convertible market is shrinking and Audi has found that buyers tend to flock to the more expensive A5 Cabriolet over the smaller A3. With a new A3 on the way soon, the current A3 Cabriolet will go away - at least here in the U.S. -- after the 2019 model year.\n\nAudi TT\n\nBuilt on the same platform as the A3 and the Volkswagen VWAGY, -0.85% Golf range, the original Audi TT introduced a revolutionary design when it first went on sale back in 1999. 20 years later though, its appeal is waning, and Audi has opted to discontinue the TT ahead of the 2020 model year. Given its funky, spherical design, though, we think it would make a great electric vehicle, and wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a battery-powered revival of the TT down the road. Meanwhile though, there are new TTs still listed for sale on Autotrader.\n\nBMW 3 Series Gran Turismo\n\nBased on the outgoing \u201cF30\u201d-generation 3 Series, the funky hatchback 3 Series Gran Turismo carried on for one year after the all-new generation 3 Series sedan was introduced. Alas, the writing was on the wall for the 3 Series GT, and it goes away after 2019.\n\nBMW 6 Series Gran Turismo\n\nThe new BMW 8 Series effectively replaced the 6 Series in BMW\u2019s lineup, and thus the 6 Series has played a bit of an odd role in recent years. A successor to the BMW 5 Series Gran Turismo was offered under the 6 Series nameplate over the past few years, but like the 3 Series Gran Turismo, goes away for 2020.\n\nBMW 6 Series Gran Coupe\n\nWhile the BMW 6 Series Coupe and Convertible were discontinued last year, the 6 Series Gran Coupe carried on for another model year. With the unveiling of the 4-door 8 Series Gran Coupe though, its time has come, and the 2019 model year will be the 6 Series Gran Coupe\u2019s last.\n\nBuick Cascada\n\nBuick The Buick Cascada\n\nThe convertible Cascada never had much success in the U.S. A rebadged Opel, the Cascada was overpriced and impractical and thus failed to attract many buyers, especially given that it was often sold on the same lot as the more exciting Chevrolet Camaro. Accordingly, the Cascada will be laid to rest after 2019. As it was never very popular, there aren\u2019t as many new Cascadas still out there as there are other vehicles on this list. Right now on Autotrader, they are still listed for sale.\n\nBuick LaCrosse\n\nGM GM, -0.20% has announced the discontinuation of its line of large, front-wheel-drive sedans, which means the end for the semi-luxurious LaCrosse. A comfortable, spacious sedan, the current-generation LaCrosse just went on sale for the 2017 model year, and was available with all-wheel drive and a potent V6 engine. Alas, the LaCrosse falls victim to the rise in popularity of SUVs, and 2019 will be its last model year.\n\nCadillac XTS\n\nLike the LaCrosse, the Cadillac XTS is another one of GM\u2019s large FWD sedans that is going away after 2019. A little more polished and a little more luxurious than the LaCrosse, the XTS offered comfort and style, although it had been made virtually obsolete in the Cadillac lineup in recent years by the new CT6 and redesigned CTS. While it\u2019s going away soon, the XTS isn\u2019t quite dead yet, and there are still many listed for sale on Autotrader.\n\nBe sure to read: The ultimate car-buying checklist\u2014for even the most experienced shopper\n\nChevrolet Impala\n\nThe most economical of GM\u2019s triumvirate of midsize sedans is being discontinued in 2019, the Chevrolet Impala offers comfort and serenity just like the LaCrosse and the XTS, but at a lower price and with fewer luxurious features. Don\u2019t worry though if you\u2019re hoping to get behind the wheel of a brand-new Impala in the coming year, as there are currently tons of new examples still listed for sale on Autotrader.\n\nChevrolet Cruze\n\nWhile it offers an attractive design, good technology and a fuel-efficient powertrain, the Cruze is another sedan that has fallen victim to the SUV onslaught, and production is set to end after the 2019 model year There are still loads of new Cruzes listed for sale on Autotrader, many of which are the practical hatchback body style, and a few of which come with the diesel engine.\n\nChevrolet Volt\n\nThe original Chevrolet Volt came out back in 2011 and paired a small electric powertrain with a range-extending gas engine. Sales of the original were strong enough to justify the introduction of a second-gen Volt that came out for 2016, but as GM is turning its focus to fully-electric vehicles heading into the future, there\u2019s no longer a place for the Volt in Chevrolet\u2019s lineup going forward, and the 2019 model year will be the Volt\u2019s last. Fear not if you\u2019re looking to still get your hands on one of these plug-in hybrids, as there are close to 700 new Volts still listed for sale on Autotrader. Looking for a fully-electric GM product? Check out the Bolt.\n\nFiat 500\n\nFiat The Fiat 500\n\nWith the economic downturn and sky-high gas prices seen in the U.S. at the beginning of this decade, automakers scrambled to introduce small, efficient city cars. Fast forward a few years though, and a stronger economy means that the market for these microcars has all but dried up, and Fiat-Chrysler FCAU, -0.40% has announced that sales of the diminutive 500 will end in the U.S. after 2019, citing a lack of demand.\n\nFord Fiesta\n\nWhile an all-new Fiesta was introduced last year, it won\u2019t be sold in the U.S., leaving the nameplate to die here with the discontinuation of the current-gen Fiesta after 2019. Even though it\u2019ll be going away soon, there are still loads of new Fiestas sitting on dealer lots.\n\nFord Taurus\n\nIntroduced way back in 2010, the current-generation Ford F, +0.34% Taurus soldiered on here in the U.S. for nearly a decade. But as all good things must come to an end, the full-size Taurus will end production after 2019. While news of the Taurus\u2019 demise has been out for a while now, there are still over 600 new Taurus\u2019 listed for sale on Autotrader, some with AWD, and some of which are even the high-performance SHO model.\n\nJaguar XJ\n\nLong serving as Jaguar\u2019s flagship model, the big XJ won\u2019t live to see the 2020 model year. While no immediate successor has been formally announced, there are rumblings that Jaguar will introduce a new, electric-powered sedan in the next few years that will effectively take the XJ\u2019s place in the lineup (and it might even bear the XJ name). If you\u2019re interested in getting your hands on what will likely be the last of the big, gas-powered Jaguar sedans, there are plenty of brand-new XJs still listed for sale on Autotrader.\n\nNissan 370Z Roadster\n\nNissan The Nissan 370Z Roadster\n\nThe 370Z is ancient, having been introduced way back in 2008 as a 2009 model. Clearly on its last leg, Nissan NSANY, +0.90% has discontinued the 370Z Roadster for the 2020 model year, while the Coupe version will soldier on for at least another year. While it\u2019s been known for a while now that the 370Z Roadster would be going away, there are still new examples listed for sale.\n\nNissan Titan Single Cab and XD Diesel\n\nNissan is in an odd place with the Titan, which is firmly entrenched as the fifth-place midsize pickup in terms of sales here in the U.S., behind Ford, GM, GM, -0.20% Ram and Toyota. TM, +0.47% As such, they\u2019ve tried to mix things up from a product standpoint in recent years, introducing a Cummins diesel-powered Titan a few years back. The diesel never caught on, and it goes away for 2020, as does the Titan\u2019s slow-selling single-cab body style.\n\nAlso read: Buying a car is more expensive than ever \u2014 here\u2019s why\n\nThe entire Smart brand\n\nSmart USA The Smart car\n\nAs Smart\u2019s entire brand is built around tiny microcars, it\u2019s been left pretty exposed with the plummeting popularity of small cars here in the States. Earlier this year, it was announced by parent-company Mercedes-Benz that the Smart brand would be exiting the U.S. market after 2019. This is probably for the better, as Smart\u2019s only offering here for the 2019 model year was the electric-powered EQ fortwo.\n\nToyota Prius C\n\nToyota introduced the subcompact Prius C earlier this decade as part of the company\u2019s attempt to create a Prius subbrand of uniquely-styled hybrid-powered vehicles. This plan seems to have been scuttled, and the Prius C has soldiered on well past its sell-by date, as its fuel economy and cabin tech is barely competitive by today\u2019s standards. Not surprisingly, the 2019 model year will be the Prius C\u2019s last.\n\nRead: Why buying a 10-year-old car is a savvy move\n\nVolkswagen Beetle\n\nThe second-generation of VW\u2019s VWAGY, -0.85% reincarnated Beetle wore a new muscular design and offered some fun turbocharged powertrains. With the rise in popularity of SUVs though, not to mention the fact that it was sold alongside the Golf, which was always a much better overall package, there really isn\u2019t a place for the Beetle in VW\u2019s lineup anymore. While we suspect it\u2019ll reappear as an EV down the line, the Beetle as we know it goes away after 2019. If you\u2019re hoping to pick up a new Beetle before these unique hatchbacks disappear from dealer lots, you\u2019re in luck, as there are currently many new examples still listed for sale.\n\nVolkswagen Golf Sportwagen and Alltrack\n\nOut of all the cars being discontinued for 2020, this one hurts the most. As VW gets ready to launch an all-new Golf in Europe in the next few months, the company\u2019s Golf-related offerings are being pared down in the U.S. for 2020. While the current-generation GTI will carry on, sales of the Golf Sportwagen, the Golf Alltrack and the Golf R will end after 2019. While an all-new Golf R should be introduced soon, things aren\u2019t looking good for fans of the Sportwagen and the Alltrack, as VW will likely look to fill their spots with increased SUV sales here in the U.S. There are plenty of brand new Sportwagens and Alltracks still listed for sale though.", "description": "Dealers will likely want to clear them from their lots, giving you the chance at a great buy on a new car.", "authors": ["Chris O'Neill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS516_at_dea_ZG_20191002165142.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
