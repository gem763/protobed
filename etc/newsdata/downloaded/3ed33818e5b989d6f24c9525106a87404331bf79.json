Which is, in scientific terms, a whole ass lifetime away. Taking a step back from thoughtfully conceived science-fiction epics, Johnson has assembled a super-talented and wonderfully unexpected ensemble cast to make this whodunnit about a house full of suspects who all could have murdered their family\u2019s rich patriarch, played by Christopher Plummer. It\u2019s not the most obvious A-list collection of actors, but one where each name that rolls past you in the casting announcement makes you go, \u201cOh good choice!\u201d So watch the new trailer and thrill as you catch Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, Michael Shannon, Katherine Langford, Jaeden Martell, Ana de Armas, and Analeigh Tipton try to convince Lakeith Stanfield and Daniel Craig that they didn\u2019t kill their family member.
