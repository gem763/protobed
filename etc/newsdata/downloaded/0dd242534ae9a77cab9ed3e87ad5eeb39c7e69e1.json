He added Durant will have a say in determining when he\u2019s ready.\n\n\u201cWith Kevin, I think what we\u2019re going to say is the expectations are that he\u2019ll be out for the year,\u201d Marks said.\n\nDurant is recovering from surgery to repair a ruptured Achilles tendon. He was injured while playing for Golden State in the NBA Finals, then left the Warriors to sign with the Nets in July.\n\nAt the time, the Nets left open the possibility that Durant could play this season. That\u2019s still possible, but Marks isn\u2019t banking on it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been excited to see, I think we all have, how he\u2019s approached this rehab, which has been great, very refreshing and energizing for the whole group,\u201d Marks said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, this is a long-term plan here. This was never about this next season. This is about getting an elite athlete back to elite physical shape on the court, whatever that takes.\u201d\n\nDurant returned from an injured calf muscle he suffered in the postseason for Game 5 of the NBA Finals, but lasted only 12 minutes before leaving with a more severe injury.\n\nMarks said Durant hasn\u2019t given any indication that he plans to take things slowly.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re looking at one of the great competitors out there, so I think I would be remiss if I said no, he probably doesn\u2019t want to play,\u201d Marks said. \u201cI think it\u2019s obvious he wants to play, but I think there\u2019s more at stake here.\n\n\u201cThis is, again, a long-term approach. There are a lot of people with a lot of sweat equity in this from the rehab perspective and so forth. And so I think it\u2019ll be a group that makes the decision, and obviously Kevin included as to when and how that return is made.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Marks thinks Durant will try to be around his new team, though he can\u2019t predict how much. He isn\u2019t even sure yet whether Durant will accompany the Nets to China next month for their exhibition games against the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nDurant is expected to speak Friday when the Nets hold their media day.\n\nHe signed with Brooklyn along with fellow All-Star Kyrie Irving, who was hurt Tuesday when he was elbowed during a pickup game. Marks doesn\u2019t believe the injury is serious, although Irving went for an evaluation accompanied by coach Kenny Atkinson.\n\nWhen Durant and Irving join a team that won 42 games and made the playoffs last season, the Nets could turn into one of the top contenders in the Eastern Conference. They know it could take a season.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that all the guys we signed in the offseason are coming here for mediocrity,\u201d Marks said. \u201cThat\u2019s not part of it. This is why we went in.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "General manager Sean Marks said Tuesday the Nets are planning this season without the injured All-Star.
