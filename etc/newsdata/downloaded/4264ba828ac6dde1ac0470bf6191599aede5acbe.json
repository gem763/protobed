Its self-assured waddle. The way it leans its feathered neck forward, with an almost innocent inquisitiveness, before turning on some poor guy\u2019s sprinklers and drenching him.\n\nHow it flaps and flutters after its plans have been thwarted by a human, only to immediately compose itself and clap back with a look that says, \u201cActually, I\u2019m the one who should be feeling offended after you took back the priceless vase I stole from you and was planning to shatter into a million pieces.\u201d The goose is a piece of crap. I love the goose.\n\nUntitled Goose Game became a phenomenon long before its release yesterday for PC and Switch. A 2017 pre-alpha trailer, which depicted a goose messing with a groundskeeper whose blood pressure will probably never recover, tapped into something essential and primal: Geese are arseholes.\n\nThey\u2019re equal parts haughty and inscrutably mean. They while away their days performing mundane acts of domestic terrorism \u2014 blocking paths, honking angrily at anyone who dares approach them, and just generally displaying a smug, unearned confidence.\n\nThe power fantasy underlying Untitled Goose Game is a tantalising if dark glimpse into the most remote recesses of the psyche. What, the game asks, if the bullied (humanity) became the bully (a lone goose)?\n\nThe result is a chill mashup of sandbox-y stealth and puzzling. You, the goose, are turned loose in a series of small town environments, including the aforementioned groundskeeper\u2019s garden, a storefront, a tavern and some neighbours\u2019 backyard.\n\nEach environment seamlessly flows together, but you have to complete most (though not all) objectives on a list before you can move on to the next. Objectives, you will not be shocked to learn, centre around ruining people\u2019s days.\n\nIn the sparsely populated garden, this might involve stealing the groundskeeper\u2019s veggies or timing a honk just right so that he accidentally hammers his own thumb while trying to put up a \u201cno geese\u201d sign.\n\nIn the more crowded tavern area, you might need to be a little stealthier, sneaking in by hopping inside a delivery person\u2019s box and crawling around in the space beneath a patio to avoid the bouncer who doesn\u2019t want you anywhere near the establishment\u2019s patrons. Then, and only then, can you carry out your master plan of dropping a bucket on his head.\n\nThere\u2019s always some amount of distraction involved. You\u2019re a goose, after all; you aren\u2019t a subtle creature.\n\nSo you honk until somebody comes over to investigate and then dart out and steal something from where they were sitting. Or you unplug somebody\u2019s radio so that they have to dedicate their time and attention to plugging it back in. Or you steal somebody\u2019s slippers and repeatedly drop them in a pond so they have to slowly, painstakingly retrieve them.\n\nThere\u2019s a cat-and-mouse element to these human-and-goose battles of wit and will, but at the same time, it isn\u2019t as though people are going to murder you. If you mess up, they\u2019ll just take back their stuff or push you off the premises with a broom. You can resume what you were doing quickly, so why not experiment?\n\nOr, better yet, why not seek immediate vengeance by stealing something out of somebody\u2019s hand or chasing them into a phone booth or honking until goose cries haunt even their fondest memories?\n\nThere\u2019s a dedicated honk button. You can honk whenever you want. It\u2019s useful for accomplishing objectives when you need to lure somebody away from whatever otherwise idyllic task they\u2019re trying to perform, but before long, I found myself using it to role-play.\n\nThere\u2019s this wonderful intimacy to Untitled Goose Game; if you get close enough to a person, the goose\u2019s gaze becomes trained on them. If they notice, they stare back.\n\nEvery time I pulled off some maniacal goose prank \u2014 moving somebody\u2019s prized rose, knocking down a portion of their neighbour\u2019s fence, getting the second person to chop the first person\u2019s rose in half \u2014 I\u2019d get the person to stare at me, wait a beat, and then emit a single, faux-quizzical HONK, as though unable to comprehend why they were staring at me.\n\n\u201cYou expect me to feel guilty?\u201d it was as though I was saying (in honks). \u201cI\u2019m a dang goose.\u201d\n\nThen I\u2019d waddle away like I hadn\u2019t definitely just spent 20 minutes meticulously orchestrating the demise of that person\u2019s good day.\n\nMoments such as these are what make Untitled Goose Game great. The environments are nice. The objectives are generally creative and enjoyable. But the real magic of the game lies in brief, endlessly funny interactions.\n\nThere\u2019s an insidious joy in drawing out increasingly infuriated reactions from the small town\u2019s people \u2014 all of whom are, in their own way, kinda douchey. They had it coming, I think. Or maybe I\u2019ve come to so thoroughly inhabit the goose\u2019s headspace that I now have an implicit bias.\n\nI appreciate that the game\u2019s humorous sensibility rarely tips over the ledge into outright absurdity, preferring instead to take an understated route where the punchline is almost always: \u201cWow, that goose is kind of a dick.\u201d You, the player \u2014 the artist of avian assholery \u2014 paint within those lines.\n\nUntitled Goose Game BACK OF THE BOX QUOTE 'HONK.' TYPE OF GAME Metal Goose Solid LIKED Understated humour, funny interactions between the goose and characters, clever objectives, fun sandbox possibilities, the honk button DISLIKED Some control and AI issues DEVELOPER House House PLATFORM PC (Played), Nintendo Switch RELEASE DATE September 20 PLAYED Finished the main game in about two and a half hours, spent an additional hour trying out bonus challenges\n\nThis low-key, easygoing vibe also makes it easier to overlook the game\u2019s shortcomings. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call them flaws, but there are things that I suspect some people won\u2019t like and that frustrated me on a few occasions.\n\nSometimes controlling the goose is a little awkward, which I suspect is intentional. There\u2019s an almost wilful sense of momentum to the goose\u2019s movements, like it won\u2019t allow even the player to fully tame its wild, dickheaded impulses. Taken in conjunction with a fixed camera perspective, it caused me to run into people I was trying to avoid a handful of times.\n\nThe AI is generally decent, but characters act as though they have eyes on the sides \u2014 if not the backs \u2014 of their heads from time to time, which caused them to spot me when they shouldn\u2019t have on a few occasions.\n\nWhile most objectives are pretty straightforward, a few either didn\u2019t make intuitive sense until I\u2019d racked my brain for longer than I enjoyed or pushed the AI to its limits.\n\nLastly, Untitled Goose Game is pretty short. I finished it in about two and a half hours, at which point I unlocked some bonus challenges, many of which I completed in another hour.\n\nAgain, though, Untitled Goose Game is a sandbox in which objectives sometimes feel more like suggestions. I still want to get back in there and just mess with people more \u2014 see what happens when I get certain characters to chase me into certain areas, or if others will react to particular items.\n\nThen there\u2019s the simple pleasure of seeing how much widespread chaos you can cause with a few well-timed honks.\n\nEven with those things in mind, I don\u2019t see Untitled Goose Game being as replayable as close genre relatives such as (bear with me on this one) the Hitman series of stealth sandbox games. But I also don\u2019t think it needs to be.\n\nIt does not bill itself as some vast, unceasing experience, a behemoth that overstays its welcome. Rather, it\u2019s like taking a nice walk through a sleepy town on a sunny afternoon.\n\nExcept, of course, for the fact that all the characters in the game are the ones taking that walk, and you\u2019re there to honk at them until they change their minds and decide to never go outside again.", "description": "The way Untitled Goose Game\u2019s goose moves, I think, is what makes it so endearing.
