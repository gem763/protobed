It added $29.2 million in its third weekend in North America. The villain origin story has grossed over $247 million domestically. Worldwide, it's earned $737.5 million, and has already surpassed the lifetime grosses of \"Justice League\" and \"Suicide Squad.\"\n\n'ABOMINABLE' TRAMPLES BOX OFFICE COMPETITION\n\nNow the big question is whether the R-rated film will make it to $1 billion, but with a $55 million production budget, it's already a massive hit for the studio and will likely also become director Todd Phillips' highest-grossing film too.\n\n\"It's already in territory that nobody thought it would get to. It's achieved a box office that is above the wildest expectations of the studio and analysts,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore's senior media analyst. \"Even if the box office stopped right now it's an absolute, unqualified success.\"\n\nThird place went to another new sequel, Columbia Pictures' \"Zombieland: Double Tap\" with $26.7 million. The R-rated comedy comes 10 years after the original, reuniting Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone and Woody Harrelson with director Ruben Fleischer.\n\n'DOWNTON ABBEY' MOVIE TOPS 'RAMBO: LAST BLOOD' IN SURPRISING BOX OFFICE UPSET\n\n\"Three films earning over $25 million, that doesn't happen very often,\" Dergarabedian noted, although the weekend is down from last year when \"Halloween\" opened to over $76 million.\n\nIn notable landmarks, \"Hustlers\" crossed $100 million domestically this weekend. It's the second STX film to do so this year after \"The Upside.\"\n\nAnd buzzy, awards-friendly indies are continuing to thrive. \"Parasite,\" which opened last weekend, added $1.2 million. This weekend, Taika Waititi's Nazi satire \"Jojo Rabbit\" opened in five theaters with a strong $350,000, the black and white Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe mindbender \"The Lighthouse\" earned $419,764 from eight theaters, and \"Jay & Silent Bob Reboot\" grossed $93,520 from one screen this weekend.\n\n'HUSTLERS' STAR JENNIFER LOPEZ'S STRIPPER MOVES CAN'T BEAT 'IT' AT BOX OFFICE\n\nBut the year is still down 5 percent from last year.\"It was a great weekend for sequels and great weekend for indie movies,\" Dergarabedian said. \"But we're still struggling to get ahead of last year. We're racing to the finish line here. We've only got 11 weekends left to go.\"\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n1.\"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,\" $36 million ($117 million international)\n\n2.\"Joker,\" $29.5 million\n\n3.\"Zombieland: Double Tap,\" $26.7 million\n\n4.\"The Addams Family,\" $16.1 million\n\n5.\"Gemini Man,\" $8.5 million\n\n6.\"Abominable,\" $3.5 million\n\n7.\"Downton Abbey,\" $3.1 million\n\n8.\"Judy,\" $2.1 million\n\n9.\"Hustlers,\" $2.1 million\n\n10.\"It: Chapter Two,\" $1.5 million.", "description": "The Walt Disney Co.'s \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil\" knocked \"Joker\" out of the No. 1 spot at the box office, but just barely.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/052914/640/360/052914_ent_maleficent_640.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
