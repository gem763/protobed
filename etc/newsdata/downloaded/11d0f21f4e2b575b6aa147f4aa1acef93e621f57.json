On Monday, as Trump faced the great, unanticipated crisis of his presidency, he was, as usual, posting. But unlike the hostile online tone he has taken throughout his nascent impeachment crisis, Trump linked to something a little more contemplative: an animated video of some of his lighter and prouder moments, set to his Liberty University commencement speech from 2017.\n\nThe first scene shows Trump, in July 2017, placing a marine\u2019s hat back on his head after a helicopter gust had knocked it off. The next snippet is from Trump\u2019s extremely cursed appearance as an SNL host in November 2015, when he danced to a parody of \u201cHotline Bling,\u201d followed by his September 2016 appearance on The Tonight Show when Jimmy Fallon ruffled his hair.\n\nAbout halfway through, it gets political, as the video includes Trump\u2019s inauguration, and what appears to be a conversation with Chuck Schumer in which he is painted as a clown. (Satire\u2019s early death has been exaggerated.) The video closes with a shot of a MAGA rally, and the incident at CPAC in March when Trump hugged the American flag. In faux-stop-motion, it almost looks like a touching moment, rather than the real-time shattering of a world leader\u2019s mind.\n\nThe video \u2014 which looks like a pharmaceutical rep re-made the animated parts of a-ha\u2019s \u201cTake on Me\u201d \u2014 was made by the user Power Tie, which at least explains why the president\u2019s oversized red formal-wear appears so prominently. Assuming the clip has Trump\u2019s approval, it\u2019s a telling 45 seconds to highlight: Some of the TV president\u2019s most joyous moments have occurred when he is performing the role of politician, but doesn\u2019t have to do anything.", "description": "As Donlad Trump faces an impeachment inquiry, he posted a 45-second animated video of some of his lighter moments set to his 2017  University commencement speech.
