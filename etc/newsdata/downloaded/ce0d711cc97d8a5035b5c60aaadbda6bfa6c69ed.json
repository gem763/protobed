We explain why this is the case. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nDonald Trump's behavior with China and Joe Biden shows how much he depends on Americans being desensitized to his repeated ethics violations\n\nAlready under the threat of an impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump said Thursday morning that China should investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. In 2013, shortly after traveling to China on an official visit with his father, Hunter was issued a Chinese business license for his new private equity fund.\n\nDon't let Trump shape a new normal\n\nBy Lisa Gilbert\n\nThe Ukraine scandal that unfolded with lightning speed has been stunning, and the ongoing revelations of corruption are even more so. Like a mafia don, President Donald Trump \u2014 having withheld nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine \u2014 put the squeeze on Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up dirt on a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter Biden. The pressure campaign spanned months and implicates Vice President Mike Pence's office, Attorney General William Barr and the president\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t stop there. Just Thursday, Trump casually referenced to reporters the need for yet another foreign power to look into the Bidens, China. In addition, on Monday, news broke that Trump pushed the Australian prime minister during a recent telephone call to help Barr gather information for a Justice Department inquiry that Trump surely hopes will discredit former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s findings. This was followed by the revelation that Barr also sought foreign assistance from British and Italian officials in investigating the Mueller report. And this is likely only just the beginning of the revelations to come.\n\nGame over for the NCAA: California law takes paying college athletes out of the NCAA's hands: Today's talker\n\nPresident Trump seems to think that if he keeps committing impeachable offenses, he can somehow normalize them and escape accountability. Yet in some ways, the barrage of news over the past week and a half has felt less shocking than it should have, because morally reprehensible, unethical and corrupt behavior is status quo for the Trump administration, and conflicts of interest, self-dealing and mobster tactics have become the new normal. When caught, Trump simply cranks up the spin machine, attacks his opponents and deflects attention by raising tariffs or rolling out another harsh immigration policy. And the country turns its attention to the next story.\n\nIt's Trump's normal, but not ours\n\nTrump\u2019s behavior in this latest scandal shows us how much he depends on the nation taking ethics violations for granted and how important it is that we shake off this desensitization as an impeachment inquiry to hold the president accountable becomes our new reality.\n\nThe danger, of course, is that we won\u2019t.\n\nUkraine whistleblower (Photo: Adam Zyglis/The Buffalo (New York) News/PoliticalCartoons.com)\n\nAfter all, the Ukraine scandal is right in line with Trump\u2019s pattern of corrupt behavior, and he is relying on the tried-and-true spin tactics that have seen him through his 2 1/2 years in office despite unceasing scandalous ethics revelations.\n\nConsider Trump\u2019s properties, which he still owns even though his family is managing them. Any money spent at those properties goes into Trump\u2019s pocket. Anyone who wants to try to influence Trump \u2014 including foreign leaders \u2014 can do so by staying at his hotels or frequenting his golf courses. When foreign leaders do it, it\u2019s a violation of the Constitution\u2019s anti-corruption (emoluments) clause. It happens routinely, mostly without our knowledge. It\u2019s hardly news anymore.\n\nForeign leaders make sure Trump knows that they spend money at his businesses. In the July 25 phone call with Trump, Zelensky noted that on a previous trip to the United States, he stayed at the Trump International Hotel and Tower near Central Park in New York City.\n\nThen consider Trump\u2019s family. It\u2019s ironic that Trump was pushing Zelensky to uncover the \u201ccorruption\u201d surrounding Biden's son, given the unsavoriness surrounding the Trump brood.\n\nFor example, this Father\u2019s Day, Ivanka Trump tweeted a photo with her father\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan. In doing so, she likely violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from using their official positions to influence an election. Still worse, she did this just days after the Office of Special Counsel found repeated violations of this law by counselor Kellyanne Conway and recommended that she be fired.\n\nThen-Vice President Joe Biden, left, and his son Hunter Biden in Washington, D.C., in January 2010. (Photo: Alexis C. Glenn/Pool)\n\nThis type of behavior has been endemic in this administration, so it\u2019s more than a little rich for Trump to anoint himself a crusader against corruption involving familial ties. While it\u2019s possible that Hunter Biden was selected to do business in Ukraine because he was the vice president\u2019s son (and Joe Biden could have asked him not to take the job), the claims of corruption allegedly committed by the Bidens in Ukraine have been debunked.\n\nSo when the whistleblower complaint and a call summary showed that the president had solicited a thing arguably of monetary value from the president of Ukraine in connection with U.S. elections \u2014 a violation of federal campaign finance laws \u2014 it might have felt like just another drop of water in the tidal wave of corruption that has washed over the country since Trump took office.\n\nIndeed, the administration is trying to make the situation appear like a just a regular day at the office, with Trump spewing lies to undermine and spin.\n\nHowever, as we all assess this clear story of extortion, we must remember that what Trump himself has admitted doing is a shocking abuse of power that threatens the foundational principles of our constitutional democracy.\n\nAnd that is not normal.\n\nLisa Gilbert is the vice president of legislative affairs at Public Citizen.

So when this same Biden takes his son with him to China aboard Air Force Two, and within days Hunter joins the board of an investment advisory firm with stakes in China ... Joe Biden has enabled this brand of practice, made it bipartisan orthodoxy. And the ethical standard in these cases \u2014 people\u2019s basic understanding of right and wrong \u2014 becomes whatever federal law allows. Which is a lot.\"\n\nDavid Axelrod, Twitter: \"The (Trump) China play today heightened my hunch that he expects bad news out of the closed door (Former Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt) Volker hearing and wanted to change the subject. ... Another motivation, obviously, if you do publicly with China what you did surreptitiously with Ukraine, it, by his thinking, abets your argument that there\u2019s nothing wrong with enlisting other countries to go after your political enemies on your behalf.\"\n\nTom Rogan, Washington Examiner: \"President Trump's phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine is deeply problematic. But Joe Biden's decision to allow his son Hunter to travel with him on a 2013 trip to China is a problem for the former vice president. ... When you're dealing with the Chinese, the lines between business and politics aren't just blurred, they are often symbiotic. ... As the child of a vice president, Hunter would have been under Secret Service protection in 2013. Tempered to protective security requirements, those records should now be released.\"\n\nWhat our readers are saying\n\nTrump is at it again. Trying to deflect anything against him onto someone else. He knows that Biden probably has the best chance to beat him, hence Trump trying to get something on him.\n\n\u2014 Kay Jones\n\nYeah, China should investigate ... because Trump trusts China, Ukraine and Russia more than his FBI and CIA.\n\n\u2014 Tom Kane\n\nTrump is still better than anyone the Democrats have running.\n\n\u2014 Jonathan Corbett\n\nI don't doubt that a whole lot of Democrats would like to see Trump impeached; however, his support with his base is strong.\n\n\u2014 Fleetwood Davant\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.
