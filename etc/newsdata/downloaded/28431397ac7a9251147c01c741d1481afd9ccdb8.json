Finally, maybe, Democratic presidential candidates no longer need to signal their \u201ctough on crime\u201d stance. They can propose that some criminal laws should be scrapped. They can commit to reducing the number of people in cages, whether that\u2019s in a county jail or a federal prison. They can call for abolishing the death penalty (59 percent of Democrats polled by Pew in 2018 would want that, too). This is a sign of how far advocates for reform have come, not just in pushing elected representatives, but creating a political environment where candidates are almost trying to out-reform one another.\n\nBut the specter of \u201ctough on crime\u201d\u2014some might remember 1988 Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis; more will recall his opponent invoking a man named Willie Horton\u2014still lingers, and most of all for the people these proposals would leave behind. A candidate\u2019s pledge to \u201cend mass incarceration\u201d can quickly crumble if it\u2019s couched in carve-outs: legalize marijuana (but not opioids), automatically expunge criminal records after five years (but only for offenses that are not serious or violent), end sentences of \u201clife in prison without parole\u201d for youth (but only after they\u2019ve served ten years, and only for crimes committed before their eighteenth birthday). All of that is what Kamala Harris proposed Monday in her plan, to, as the candidate explained in a post on Medium, \u201cfundamentally transform our criminal justice system to shift away from mass incarceration and to invest in building safer and healthier communities.\u201d\n\nHarris leans in to her criminal justice r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to convey her expertise in making such shifts in the system that once gave her such power. Before she arrived in Washington, D.C. in 2017, she had spent the previous 12 years as a prosecutor, as San Francisco\u2019s district attorney, and as California\u2019s attorney general. She held those roles before the nascent \u201cprogressive prosecutor\u201d movement succeeded in replacing old, tough-on-crime types. Local prosecutors decide which people will be prosecuted and for which crimes, and Harris was once one of them\u2014one who would likely not meet today\u2019s current standards for a \u201cprogressive\u201d prosecutor.\n\nFrom the time Harris spent \u201cworking inside the system as a prosecutor,\u201d her plan\u2019s preamble reads, \u201cKamala has seen firsthand the fundamental flaws of the system.\u201d She does not, however, ascribe any of them directly to her own conduct. Harris could, if she chose to, say clearly what actions she took as a prosecutor. She could draw on her experience to explain the kinds of cases that would fall outside her new plan. There can be no fundamental shift in this system without prosecutors examining past practices and understanding what it would take to change them. Harris, though no longer a prosecutor herself, could be a model for such accountability. So far, she has not been.", "description": "The former prosecutor offered her measured version of criminal justice reform in advance of tonight's Democratic debate.", "authors": ["Melissa Gira Grant"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/1d8fa864938474f0b6b8455e8b6d87aa695a51fe.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
