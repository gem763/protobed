Extermiknit! Doctor Who scarves tested by a Time Lord", "language": "en", "text": "The long scarf is going large this season \u2013 so who better to model it than the seventh Doctor, Sylvester McCoy?\n\nSylvester McCoy, the seventh Doctor in the long lineage of Time Lords, admits he did not know the extremely long scarf was one of this season\u2019s catwalk trends.\n\n\u201cReally, they\u2019ve got the wrong Doctor for this,\u201d he says. \u201cI just brought it back as an homage to Tom Baker.\u201d Baker, the fourth Doctor, sported a signature brightly coloured scarf that was easily 12 feet long. For his tenure, McCoy chose a more modest paisley affair.\n\nStill, McCoy reckons his lifelong predilection for scarves may have helped him get the role. \u201cPeople always said to me: \u2018You\u2019d make a good Doctor!\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I thought: \u2018I might try this.\u2019\u201d He put himself forward when Peter Davison left in 1984, but the part had already gone to Colin Baker. Two years later, when Baker was pushed out, McCoy got his chance.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about the show,\u201d he says. \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen it for years, because I was always working in the theatre.\u201d\n\nOne of the things he\u2019d missed was the acrimony surrounding his predecessor\u2019s departure. Baker declined to shoot the traditional regeneration scene for the new season, leaving McCoy to play both sides of the transformation. \u201cThey put me in his costume,\u201d he says, \u201cand they lost me for three days, \u2019cos he\u2019s a big fella.\u201d\n\nUnder the hot lights of today\u2019s photoshoot, it becomes clear that McCoy was born to model scarves. Each one becomes a prop for another hastily adopted role: pilot, priest, matador. He is a man of obscure dexterities - he can, for example, move the brim of his hat up and down with his eyebrows, using his ears as a fulcrum. He seems to favour the longest and the brightest (he can do more with these) although the scarf he turned up in today is short and sober, black with white polka dots. He seems perplexed by a wide scarf with a hole for your head (from A Cold Wall), and decides to wear it as a priestly vestment, staring heavenward while the photographer snaps.\n\nMcCoy was born Percy James Patrick Kent-Smith in Dunoon, Scotland in 1943. As a young man he moved to London and spent five unhappy years working in the City. \u201cI was terrible at it!\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, really bad.\u201d He was working in a theatre box office when he was discovered by the writer and performer Ken Campbell.\n\n\u201cHe said: \u2018\u2019Ere, d\u2019you want a job in my show?\u2019\u201d (The impersonation is eerily like the late Campbell.) \u201cI said yes. I always say yes, and then work out how to get out of it, but this time I couldn\u2019t. So I ended up becoming an actor.\u201d\n\nThe Ken Campbell Roadshow was a rowdy mix of sketches, songs, jokes and gleeful vulgarity. Joining a cast that included a young Bob Hoskins, McCoy played a stuntman called \u201cSylveste McCoy, the Human Bomb\u201d, who put ferrets down his trousers and hammered nails up his nose. With the addition of an R, his stage name was born.\n\nIn 1972, after touring the working men\u2019s clubs of Britain, the roadshow received an invitation to perform in Israel, where they alarmed and bewildered audiences for a week. \u201cThey thought they\u2019d booked the Glen Campbell Roadshow,\u201d says McCoy. \u201cThey eventually forgave us.\u201d\n\nMcCoy spent a dozen years working in children\u2019s TV (Vision On, Jigsaw, Tiswas) and theatre before he got the call-up to star in Doctor Who in 1987 (Campbell was also up for the role, but deemed too scary). In his early outings, he was a clownish Doctor \u2013 he played the spoons and did magic tricks \u2013 but over time McCoy and the writers decided to access something ambivalent in the character. \u201cIt went darker and more mysterious,\u201d he says.\n\nHe was saddled with one unfortunate bit of wardrobe as the Doctor: a multicoloured pullover with question marks all over it. \u201cI thought it was overstated,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the producer wanted it. I think his granny knitted them.\u201d The novelty jumper certainly undermined a lot of his darker scenes. \u201cIf we\u2019d done a fourth season I would have got rid of it, because by then I had the muscle.\u201d\n\nIt was not to be: for a long period McCoy seemed destined to be best known as the final Doctor. \u201cI was the one that killed it off, yeah,\u201d he says. Yet after the successful resurrection of the franchise, McCoy\u2019s three-dimensional Doctor is now seen as something of a prototype for the 21st-century incarnations. These days he is as busy as ever, working in film, TV and theatre; he even lives on as the Doctor in a popular audio series.\n\nFor the final shot of the day, McCoy drapes himself in every available scarf \u2013 a dozen or more. \u201cGo on, pile them on,\u201d he says, standing patiently while wrapped to the eyeballs, until he softly confesses that one of his knees is beginning to go. The scarves are removed. He is released.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Scarves as before, plus red tartan, \u00a317.99, hm.com. Orange, \u00a366, gestuz.com. Blanket, \u00a3390, beggandcompany.com.
