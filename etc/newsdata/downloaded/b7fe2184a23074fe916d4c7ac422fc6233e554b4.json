GM said the strike will wind up costing it $2.86 billion in net income for the year.\n\nThat forced the company to cut its full-year pretax profit guidance from $6.50 to $7 per share, to $4.50 to $4.80.\n\nExcluding one-time restructuring costs, the company made $1.72 per share, beating Wall Street estimates of $1.38, according to data provider FactSet.\n\nRevenue fell 0.9% to $35.47 billion, but still surpassed analyst estimates of $34.95 billion.\n\nWorkers, who ended their strike on Friday, were able to win a mix of pay raises and lump sums. They also got an $11,000-per-worker signing bonus, faster pay raises for newly hired employees and a path to full-time work for temporary workers. They kept their current top-notch health insurance with workers picking up only a 3% of the cost.\n\nBut GM won significant cost savings because it was able to close three underused factories that made cars and transmissions. The company is closing factories in Lordstown, Ohio; Warren, Michigan; and near Baltimore.\n\nGM\u2019s profit declined even though sales jumped 6.3% in the U.S., the company\u2019s most profitable market. The average sales price rose 2.8% to $41,661 per vehicle compared with a year ago, according to the Edmunds.com auto pricing site. Edmunds provides content to The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cDespite the strike, GM had a lot working to the company\u2019s advantage in the third quarter,\u201d said Jeremy Acevedo, senior manager of insights, said in a statement. The company, he said, is showing benefits of shedding slow-selling cars from its lineup, and production of new full-size pickup trucks are getting up to speed.\n\nLight trucks accounted for just over 88% of GM\u2019s sales during the third quarter, and truck sales rose during the quarter for the first time. GM has been switching factories over to the new truck through the year, a process that was halted by the strike.", "description": "DETROIT (AP) \u2014 Only two weeks of a lengthy strike against General Motors happened in the third quarter, but that was enough to dent the company's net", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/29/f1d50f_earns-motors-71085-oct-16-2019-file-photo-shows-sign-motors-facility-in-langhorne-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
