The study concludes:\n\n\u201cCentral banks are responding to the reality that digital currencies, either privately or publicly issued, will soon be part of the global monetary system, and that it is in their interest to ensure they are neither left behind nor displaced.\u201d\n\nWhile 73% of global banks have spoken in favor of CBDCs, as many as 82% of central bank respondents claimed that the greatest financial stability concern from CBDC use is the risk of digital bank operations at a higher speed than before, the report notes.\n\nIn addition, central banks believe that CBDCs should be available offline and function wherever cash is used to date.\n\nFirst CBDC is expected within five years\n\nBased on the research results, IBM and OMFIF have concluded that the first-ever CBDC is expected to be implemented within the next five years. The report reads:\n\n\u201cThe principal conclusion is that we are likely to witness the introduction of a central bank \u2014 that is fiat \u2014 retail digital currency within the next five years, either as a complement to or as a substitute for notes and coins.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the research says that it is unlikely that the first-ever CBDC will come from a G20 central bank, but rather is likely to be launched in a smaller and less complex economy to address a certain policy objective such as driving resilience of a national payments system or extending financial inclusion.\n\nThe results of the new study correspond with a previous and the first CBDC study by IBM and OMFIF that was released in October 2018. While the majority of global financial institutions expressed confidence that central banks should develop CBDCs, 38% said that they were actively exploring and trialing the technology at the time.\n\nIn early October, Patrick Harker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, declared that central bank digital currencies \u201care inevitable,\u201d though adding:", "description": "The first-ever CBDC will be issued within the next five years, according to new joint research by IBM and OMFIF", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy80N2FlNjlkMTMzZDM4Y2RhNDdhYzExNjU3MmU1YmEwMS5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
