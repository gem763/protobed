New Zealand, as a rugby nation, has come a long way from the widespread outcry experienced during their 24-year wait between World Cup successes from 1987 to 2011. Expectations, though, have not wavered. In fact, after securing the last two World Cup titles, those on the team have only increased.\n\nGutted but gracious: stunned New Zealanders concede 'better team won' rugby Read more\n\nThe All Blacks are expected to win every match so the brutal, comprehensive nature of their England beating is particularly difficult to take. Carrying such a weight magnifies disappointment, especially on this grand stage. That is partly why the All Blacks head coach Steve Hansen needed a moment to hold back tears as he again fronted up to dissect his side\u2019s 19-7 loss.\n\nNot long after the final whistle Hansen was spotted on his phone, off to the side of the field. Asked who he had called, Hansen began to well up. \u201cI rang my wife,\u201d he said, pausing to sip water in order to prevent his emotions from bubbling over.\n\nAfter speaking to his wife, Hansen talked to the former All Blacks coach Graham Henry - nicknamed \u2018Ted\u2019 - and centre Conrad Smith. Both men were also involved with Hansen the last time New Zealand lost a World Cup match 12 years ago.\n\n\u201cI then talked to Ted and Conrad about \u201907 and we mentioned the fact it\u2019s no different, the same gutting feeling,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cThen Ted and I talked about how well George Ford had played. Ted had quite a few comments and I did a bit of listening, trying to do a bit of learning, and then you just move on don\u2019t you?\n\n\u201cIs it hard to stomach? Course it is. It\u2019s gut-wrenching because we wanted to win the thing but so did they. Life\u2019s not fair so why would sport be fair. You don\u2019t always get the thing you want. And when you don\u2019t you\u2019ve got to measure your character on how you deal with that.\u201d\n\nThe All Blacks have to channel their pain into a game no one wants play \u2013 the playoff for third and fourth in Tokyo on Friday, one day before the final. \u201cIt\u2019s unique because it\u2019s knockout and you don\u2019t get a second chance,\u201d Hansen said, \u201cso the pain isn\u2019t alleviated by playing another Test next week.\n\n\u201cWhoever we play won\u2019t alleviate the pain that we haven\u2019t achieved what we wanted to which was come here and win it. You\u2019ve got to bank that and sit back and learn the lessons. We\u2019ll do that when the tournament finishes, about what we could have done better.\n\n\u201cWinning is easy. You don\u2019t get too much poked at you. But when you lose you are gutted but at the same time you have to show humility and do it gracefully and be honest. Sometimes you just have to bite down on your gum shield and suck it up.\u201d\n\nOther than Ford, Hansen praised the England lock Maro Itoje, the man of the match, saying he was a more complete player than when he featured for the British and Irish Lions two years ago and that he could evolve into a great of the game.\n\nPlay Video 0:35 Rugby World Cup: England stun New Zealand 19-7 to reach final \u2013 video highlights\n\n\u201cThis England team hasn\u2019t just snuck up and poked us in the face. They won 18 games in a row \u2013 there\u2019s only one other team over the history of the game that\u2019s done that. That makes them a pretty formidable side.\n\n\u201cThey were a team that, coming into this tournament, and the last four years, had a massive amount of pain, having the adversity of not making the quarter-finals of their own tournament. They\u2019ve been working their butts off probably more so than any other England team in history. We got what we expected.\u201d\n\nEngland stride past All Blacks towards rugby\u2019s greatest prize Read more\n\nThe All Blacks captain Kieran Read cut a shattered figure last night and with one more match left in his test career, his inner wounds may never properly heal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty empty,\u201d Read said of his feelings. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we came here for, that\u2019s the reality of it. It\u2019s not going to define us as a group or who we are. There\u2019s no two ways around it that you\u2019re really gutted but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of people in that same boat with us and going through those emotions. We feel for them as well.\n\n\u201cAs the leader you look at ways you could have done things differently but that\u2019s all hindsight. It\u2019s not going to affect your emotions right now. It\u2019s not going to change the fact we lost. I\u2019m proud of the effort and character.\u201d\n\nOn his 34th birthday, Read at least found solace when he arrived back to his hotel after the game. \u201cThere were cards from my kids waiting for me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat puts things in perspective. It\u2019s a rugby game. People care, we care, so you enjoy moments. For me I\u2019m a dad, and first and foremost that\u2019s the thing I want to be remembered by.\u201d", "description": "Steve Hansen called the experience of losing to England gut-wrenching as New Zealand came to terms with their semi-final defeat", "authors": ["Liam Napier In Tokyo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf5c30bd56e4d834013c189fb8c7806b185500ee/0_120_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b585423b7297abe510a38ecec99fa334", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
