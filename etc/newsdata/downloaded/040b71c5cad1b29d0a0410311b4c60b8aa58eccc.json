J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side simply refused to buckle when Chelsea turned up the heat and, although the European champions were clinging on at times, in the end they were able to celebrate a rare and precious win at the home of one of their big-six rivals.\n\nWinning without playing well is the mark of potential champions and ruthless goals from Trent Alexander-Arnold and Roberto Firmino were enough for Liverpool to restore their five-point lead over Manchester City in testing circumstances. Chelsea, a team transformed by the dynamism of N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, were relentless during the second half and came within a whisker of completing an impressive comeback from two goals down, only for Mason Mount and Michy Batshuayi to waste presentable opportunities to snatch a point in the dying stages.\n\nSmall details make the difference at this level and Frank Lampard, who is still waiting for his first home win as Chelsea manager, took little solace from his side\u2019s frenzied effort after the break. The awkward number confronting Lampard is that Chelsea have conceded 13 goals from their opening six league games, leaving them with a negative goal difference in 11th place. They defended badly from set pieces, stumbled in front of goal and ended up looking what they are, an inconsistent and imprecise side struggling to adjust to life under the most inexperienced manager in the league.\n\nIn previous years the sight of the fans in the lower tier of the Matthew Harding Stand unfurling a banner bearing Eden Hazard\u2019s image might have sent a shiver down the spine of the opposition. Those days have gone, though, and as motivational ploys go it seemed a strange choice when Hazard\u2019s face appeared behind Kepa Arrizabalaga\u2019s goal before kick-off.\n\nWith Hazard\u2019s jinks down the left consigned to the past, Alexander-Arnold had more freedom to support Mohamed Salah from right-back and it was not long before the visitors exposed one of Chelsea\u2019s biggest weaknesses with a powerful surge through the middle from Fabinho.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nThe return of Kant\u00e9 from a persistent ankle injury allowed Lampard to switch from a 3-4-2-1 system to a 4-3-3 but cracks soon appeared. The visitors started well and the danger was clear when Fabinho, charging past weak challenges from Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho, fizzed a pass into Sadio Man\u00e9, who lured Andreas Christensen into making a panicky foul.\n\nThe position of the free-kick, a couple of yards outside the area, meant power represented the clearest route to goal. Jordan Henderson acted as a decoy, Salah\u2019s backheel teed up Alexander-Arnold and Chelsea froze as the youngster crashed a tremendous shot high to Arrizabalaga\u2019s left.\n\nPlay Video 1:47 VAR decision was 'deflating' admits Frank Lampard after Chelsea's 2-1 defeat to Liverpool \u2013 video\n\nThe opening period quickly became an ordeal for Lampard. His gamble on Emerson Palmieri\u2019s fitness backfired when the left-back limped off, his defence was further weakened when Christensen made way for Kurt Zouma after suffering a knee injury and, on the one occasion Tammy Abraham managed to sprint away from Virgil van Dijk, the young striker failed to thread the ball past Adri\u00e1n in the Liverpool goal.\n\nLampard needed his team to be clinical, though he was encouraged by their willingness to keep probing. Liverpool were surprised that Mount was fit to start on the left after shaking off an ankle injury and Alexander-Arnold struggled defensively at times. He was indebted to VAR after Willian found space to send in a cross that C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta converted from close range. The goal was ruled out when replays showed that Mount had strayed offside during the buildup.\n\nAubameyang breaks Aston Villa hearts as 10-man Arsenal bounce back late on Read more\n\nLampard turned back to his bench with a rueful look and Chelsea\u2019s frustration deepened when Liverpool doubled their lead moments later. Alexander-Arnold touched a free-kick to Andy Robertson and the left-back\u2019s cross allowed Firmino to rise above Marcos Alonso, Emerson\u2019s replacement, and head past Arrizabalaga.\n\nThis was not a vintage display from Liverpool\u2019s front three, however, and Chelsea dominated the second half. Kant\u00e9 took Liverpool on almost single-handedly during the European Super Cup last month and the midfielder was just as inspired here, halving the deficit with a fine shot from 20 yards in the 71st minute.\n\nThe Frenchman was everywhere, chasing back to stop Salah bursting clear, and Liverpool, who lost Man\u00e9 to a knock late on, breathed huge sighs of relief when Batshuayi and Mount wasted those late opportunities. Given how tight this title race is likely to be, Klopp will cherish holding on to this gritty win.", "description": "Goals from Trent Alexander-Arnold and Roberto Firmino gave Liverpool a 2-1 away victory over Chelsea, who pulled one back though N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9", "authors": ["Jacob Steinberg"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40d277c6769f7e3ec998d2e809a84941e666038a/29_0_7028_4217/master/7028.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e7cc2b6d63ca12d263da836858d99b8e", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
