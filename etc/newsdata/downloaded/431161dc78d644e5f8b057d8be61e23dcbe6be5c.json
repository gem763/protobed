Facing the militarily superior Turkish forces, the Kurdish fighters struck a deal with the regime of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad \u2014 a government backed by Russia and Iran \u2014 to allow Syrian government forces back into the country\u2019s northeast.\n\nThe troop movements are set to radically alter Syria\u2019s geopolitical maps, even though it was still unclear how far either of the two powers would end up advancing into Kurdish territories as of Wednesday. First reports indicated gains for Assad near Manbij and Turkish advances near Ras al-Ayn.\n\nOctober 16, 2019 Assad regime Syrian rebels Kurdish groups Turkish or pro-Turkish forces TURKEY Ras al-ayn Aleppo Manbij Mosul Latakia Tabqa Idlib Tigris Deir al-Zour IRAQ Homs Med.

But he cautioned that it remained unclear what sort of control regime forces will exert there, both in the short and long run.\n\nSyrian forces may initially act as a deterrence to Turkey, but not seize full control of the areas, said Strack. That could change in the coming weeks, however.\n\nWhile the Syrian government may not yet fully control those areas, its forces now have a more expansive geographical footprint than at any time over the last half decade \u2014 a direct result of Trump\u2019s Syria pullout.\n\nWhat factors will determine how much Assad can gain?\n\nOn paper, a deal between the SDF and the Syrian regime could give Assad control over all territory currently held by Kurdish forces. Prior to the U.S. pullout, Kurds occupied 28 percent of inhabited, non-desert territory in Syria. The Assad regime could now theoretically gain control over this area, meaning it would double the amount of land currently governs.\n\nHow control over Syria has evolved Prior to Trump\u2019s Syria pullout, Assad\u2019s territorial advances had slowed down. His regime could now gain control of large parts of the Kurdish-held areas.

Turkey is unlikely to give up that territory, as it plans to resettle Syrian refugees there. (It\u2019s unclear how much further Turkey can advance, though, as international pressure from Europe and the United States mounts, and as Assad\u2019s forces begin facing off with Turkish troops.)\n\nA second unknown factor is whether all stakeholders that so far had a say in the SDF-held territory are on board with an Assad deal. \u201cThe SDF are not purely Kurdish. There are also Sunni Arab tribal components and they are opposed to this reconciliation with the Assad government,\u201d said Strack, the Middle East analyst.\n\nAreas in Syria\u2019s east were particularly likely to resist Assad seizing control, he said.\n\nWhat do Assad\u2019s advances mean in the long run?\n\nThey may indicate an uncomfortable truth: \u201cAssad is winning the war,\u201d Strack argued.\n\nIn a way, the last nine months were an outlier: Since the beginning of the year, government forces have made so few advances that they did not account for one percentage point of Syria\u2019s full territory.\n\nThere were few territorial changes near rebel-held Idlib in the northwest. Meanwhile, the Kurdish forces \u2014 which at the time were backed by the United States \u2014 stood their ground.\n\nBut the largely static territorial situation this year differed significantly from prior years \u2014 with heavy shifts between different factions \u2014 and it was unlikely to last.\n\nAssad\u2019s days appeared numbered shortly after the beginning of the Syrian civil war in March 2011. By September 2013, Syrian opposition groups had taken over large swaths of the country.\n\nSeptember 2013 Assad regime Syrian rebels TURKEY Ras al-ayn Aleppo Mosul Raqqa Latakia Tabqa Idlib Deir al-Zour IRAQ Homs Med.

His regime only held 16 percent of Syria\u2019s inhabited areas at that stage.\n\nIn the north, the Kurds had taken over about 11 percent of Syria\u2019s territory.\n\nHaving accumulated about 30 percent of the territory, the Islamic State was wreaking havoc in the north, east and center of Syria.\n\nThe Islamic State did not only battle other Syrian enemies, but also a U.S.-led coalition, which mainly used airstrikes to combat the militant group starting in 2014.\n\nRussia, which backed Assad from the beginning, entered the war one year later. Starting in late 2015, Russia\u2019s military targeted both moderate rebels and the Islamic State.\n\nOctober 12, 2015 Assad regime Syrian rebels Kurdish groups Islamic State TURKEY Ras al-ayn Aleppo Mosul Raqqa Latakia Tabqa Idlib Deir al-Zour IRAQ Homs Med.

Meanwhile, the Russian-backed Assad regime had made inroads into territory previously held by the Islamic State and rebels.\n\nBut a look at a map of both Iraq and Syria reveals what Turkish military planners appeared increasingly worried about: A large cross-country territory held by Kurdish groups in Syria and Iraq, whom they insist are tied to the Kurdish Workers\u2019 Party (PKK). Turkey views the PKK as a terror group and a direct threat to the Turkish government.\n\nOctober 23, 2017 Assad regime Syrian rebels Kurdish groups Islamic State TURKEY Ras al-ayn Aleppo Mosul Raqqa Latakia Tabqa Idlib Deir al-Zour IRAQ Homs Med.
