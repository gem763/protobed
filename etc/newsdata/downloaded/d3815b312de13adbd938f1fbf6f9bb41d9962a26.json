(Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nSpeaking at the International Astronautical Congress in Washington Tuesday morning, Bezos called it a \u201cnational team for a national priority. .... This is the kind of thing that\u2019s so ambitious that it needs to be done with partners. This is the only way to get back to the moon fast. We\u2019re not going back to the moon to visit. We\u2019re going back to the moon to stay.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this year, the White House dramatically sped up NASA\u2019s moon program by calling for the space agency to get humans there by 2024 \u2014 not 2028, as had been originally planned. That accelerated timeline for what NASA calls its Artemis program has been criticized as unrealistic, but the companies said that with their combined expertise and heritage, they could meet the deadline.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that this project and the time frame that the nation is calling for is ambitious, very ambitious,\u201d said Brent Sherwood, Blue Origin\u2019s vice president of advanced development programs. \u201cAnd so we\u2019ve pulled together the best in the industry to make this happen with our partner, NASA.\u201d\n\nNASA has not announced what the contract for the lunar lander would be worth, saying it first needs to see what sorts of offerings it gets from industry before coming up with a price.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlue Origin first pitched NASA on a lunar lander it calls Blue Moon in 2017, and in May, Bezos unveiled a life-size mock-up of the spacecraft in Washington. Getting to the moon has long been a priority for Bezos, who founded Blue Origin in 2000 with the goal of dramatically lowering the cost of spaceflight and helping humanity spread farther into the solar system.\n\nHe has said that Blue Origin is the \u201cmost important work that I\u2019m doing,\u201d and he has lauded the White House\u2019s plan to return to the moon quickly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d Bezos said in May. He said the company could help meet the 2024 mandate because it started development of the lunar lander three years ago.\n\nAD\n\nBut the White House\u2019s lunar ambitions have run into a roadblock in Congress, where Democrats in particular are skeptical. While NASA has requested an additional $1.6 billion in funding for the program for next year\u2019s budget, it has yet to release a price tag for the entire, multiyear plan, estimated to cost between $20 billion and $30 billion.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe President has decided to play politics with the Artemis program by seeking to speed up plans to send humans back to the moon in 2024 instead of 2028 without a strong justification for doing so,\u201d Rep. Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano (D-N.Y.), the chair of the House appropriations subcommittee that funds NASA, said in a recent statement to The Post.\n\nGiven the vast difficulties with landing on the moon, even Ken Bowersox, NASA\u2019s acting head of human exploration, said it seemed unlikely that NASA could meet the 2024 deadline.\n\nAD\n\nWhile it is good to have \u201can aggressive goal,\u201d he said during a congressional hearing last month that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t bet my oldest child\u2019s upcoming birthday present or anything like that.\u201d NASA last week announced that Doug Loverro, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for space policy, would take over the head of human exploration position.\n\nAD\n\nAs part of its plan to get astronauts to the moon for the first human landing since Apollo 17 in 1972, NASA plans to build an outpost called the Gateway, which would stay in orbit around the moon. Astronauts would first fly to the Gateway, and then be transported to the lunar surface by the landing system, which would also have a spacecraft known as an \u201cascent vehicle\u201d capable of transporting them back to the Gateway.\n\nBlue Origin would build a lander capable of transporting several metric tons to the lunar surface. Lockheed Martin, which is already developing the Orion spacecraft to transport astronauts from Earth to the Gateway, would build the ascent crew vehicle to fly them to and from the surface of the moon. Northrop Grumman would build a transfer vehicle that would station the lander in low lunar orbit. And Draper would work on the guidance and navigation systems.\n\nAD\n\nWhile the team is formidable, it appears to have competition. Boeing said it also would bid for the human lander. And Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX is developing a next-generation spacecraft, known as Starship, that it says could also take people to the lunar surface. Though it hasn\u2019t said whether it intends to bid on the lunar lander contract, a spokesman said the company\u2019s spacecraft and rocket \u201care integral to accelerating NASA\u2019s lunar and Mars plans.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTo meet the goal for Artemis, NASA has been trying to speed up its procurement process. Blue Origin said that, if it were awarded the contract, work on the program could start as soon as January. But Congress would need to provide the funding for the years to come, and NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine has been spending an enormous amount of time meeting with lawmakers, hoping to win support.\n\n\u201cThe obstacles are not really technical challenges,\u201d Blue Origin\u2019s Sherwood said. \u201cIt depends on the speed of the procurement and the budget behind it.\u201d\n\nRead More:\n\nAD", "description": "The secretive space company has formed a partnership with Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper to build a lunar landing system.", "authors": ["Christian Davenport", "Reporter Covering The Defense", "Space Industries"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/iux_bGwnvFlJj6gKJBlE4D_jVEU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VSV4Z3GF4II6TC7XZXRNTYEQKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
