This will not stick!\u201d Bolsonaro fumed after the report on Marielle Franco\u2019s 2018 murder.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t lose it. I\u2019m the president of the Republic. But I confess I have reached my limit,\u201d the visible incandescent politician shouts at one point in his 23-minute live broadcast.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s eruption was a response to a politically explosive investigative report by Jornal Nacional, Brazil\u2019s answer to the Nine O\u2019Clock News, on Tuesday night.\n\nThe report revealed that the suspected killers of Marielle Franco \u2013 the leftist politician who was gunned down in March 2018 \u2013 had met at Bolsonaro\u2019s seaside compound in Rio de Janeiro in the hours before her murder.\n\nJair Bolsonaro pictured with second accused in Marielle Franco murder case Read more\n\nOne of those men, \u00c9lcio Queiroz, reportedly gained entry to the compound at about 5.10pm by telling a security guard he was visiting Bolsonaro, the owner of house No 58.\n\nBolsonaro was, in fact, hundreds of miles away in Bras\u00edlia on that day. But an unidentified person at his house \u2013 who the security guard identified as \u201cJair\u201d \u2013 reportedly authorized Queiroz\u2019s entry.\n\nInstead of heading to Bolsonaro\u2019s property, Queiroz reportedly went to another residence \u2013 No 66 \u2013 which was the home of Ronnie Lessa, a special forces police officer turned contract killer currently being held on suspicion of Franco\u2019s murder.\n\nCiting anonymous sources, Globo claimed that minutes after Queiroz\u2019s arrival, he and Lessa left the compound in the latter\u2019s car and then changed vehicles nearby before \u2013 it is alleged \u2013 proceeding to central Rio where Franco was later killed.\n\nBolsonaro reacted furiously to the story.\n\n\u201cIt is villainy what you are doing \u2026 to run a story like this on prime time TV,\u201d Brazil\u2019s president said in his broadcast, on several occasions appearing close to tears.\n\n\u201cFor the love of God who do you think you are?\u201d Bolsonaro continued, addressing journalists from the channel behind the report, TV Globo. \u201cI know what you are: you\u2019re scumbags! Rascals! You aren\u2019t patriots. You don\u2019t think about Brazil.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday morning Bolsonaro allies went on the offensive.\n\nGen Augusto Heleno, his hawkish institutional security chief, claimed the revelations were an attempt to destabilize Brazil \u201cand stir violent protests like those taking place in other Latin American countries\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Brazilian people will not allow them to achieve their poisonous goals,\u201d Heleno tweeted.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s lawyer, Frederick Wassef, told Globo its report was \u201ca lie, a fraud and a farce designed to attack the president\u2019s image and the reputation\u201d.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s son Eduardo branded the story \u201cfake news\u201d and called the journalists behind it \u201cbums\u201d.\n\nBut members of the opposition called for an urgent investigation and some political analysts foresaw choppy waters ahead for both Bolsonaro and Brazil.\n\nFormer environment minister Marina Silva demanded an inquiry into what she called \u201cvery serious allegations \u2026 so that not the slightest suspicion hangs over the occupant of the highest office in the republic\u201d.\n\nJean-Paul Prates, a senator for the leftist Workers\u2019 party (PT), said he believed foreign investors would \u201cshudder\u201d as they watched Bolsonaro\u2019s social media rant.\n\n'I'm waiting for her to come back': Marielle Franco's fiancee on life a month after Rio councillor's murder Read more\n\n\u201cThis could be a devastating blow for Bolsonaro,\u201d said David Miranda, a leftist Rio congressman who was friends with Franco.\n\nTuesday night\u2019s report is not the first time Bolsonaro has been linked to Franco\u2019s suspected killers.\n\nIn March a photograph emerged showing a grinning Bolsonaro with his arm around Queiroz, who police believe was driving the car used to commit the crime.\n\nEarlier this month another photograph surfaced showing Bolsonaro with Josinaldo Lucas Freitas, a martial arts instructor suspected of disposing of the guns used in Franco\u2019s murder by throwing them in the sea.\n\nPolice have also confirmed that one of Bolsonaro\u2019s sons had dated Lessa\u2019s daughter.\n\nReports in the Brazilian press painted Bolsonaro\u2019s neighbour as a ruthless killer who lost his leg in a 2009 bomb attack and made a fortune as a member of a group of contract killers called the Escrit\u00f3rio do Crime (the Crime Bureau).\n\nAdditional reporting by Dom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro", "description": "Brazilian president seethes after investigation revealed suspects met at his compound before leftist politician\u2019s murder", "authors": ["Tom Phillips"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77d2100998cf836610c9ba4ce3e748860d451ada/0_180_3413_2047/master/3413.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d037b94e55185a37ca49f4c18c330b3b", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
