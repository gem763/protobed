Jodi's parents are heard laughing at the pup's resistance\n\nAlbert's adorable tantrum was captured in a hilarious video which shows the defiant pup sliding across the living room carpet as Jodi tries to get him out of her parents' house.\n\nIn the funny footage, Jodi tells Albert how 'unloved' he's making her feel while her dad, mum Jill Street, 70, and their friend can be heard laughing hysterically at the puppy's antics.\n\nWhen he reaches the door, Albert finally concedes and stands up ready for Jodi to take him home.\n\nEvery Monday and Tuesday, David and Jill dog-sit Albert as Jodi works from 7am-7pm and her partner Ben Johnstone-Smith usually picks the pooch up on his way home at 4:30pm.\n\nFrench Bulldog puppy Albert is owned by Jodi Street but has a special bond with Jodi's dad David Street, 69 (pictured above with Albert)\n\nHowever on October 8, 37-year-old Ben had to work late so Jodi went to pick up their pup at the end of her 12-hour shift - only to find Albert wanted to stay put.\n\nJodi said: 'Talk about feeling unloved. Albert had a day at grandaddy day care and didn't want to come home with his mum.\n\n'I went to pick him up and he just wasn't interested. He was running away, doing zoomies around the living room.\n\n'Eventually me and my dad got hold of him and got his lead on and he just laid down and completely spread out. His whole body was stretched out.\n\n'He was refusing to leave. I had to slide him across the floor and he was looking up at me out of the corner of his eye as if to say 'I'm not going anywhere'.\n\n'I was thinking 'come on I've not seen you for 12 hours, normally you're happy to see me. It's like you don't want to come home. That makes me feel great. I'm your mum, I do everything for you'.\n\n'I did feel very unloved but it was so funny at the same time. Eventually he was like 'okay, we'll go home'.\n\n'As soon as we got home, he was absolutely fine and loved me again.'\n\nJodi Street, 42, with puppy Albert. 'No matter how many people come round, if my dad is there, he will have all of Albert's attention. And my dad would do anything for Albert,' she said\n\nJodi claims the dog became 'obsessed' with David as a nine-week-old puppy.\n\nWhenever David is around, he is the only person Albert pays attention to and the dog gets excited and waits by the door if Jodi tells him 'grandad is coming round'.\n\nJodi said: 'Albert is obsessed with my dad. He obviously loves us too. I keep telling myself that.\n\n'We noticed they had a special bond as soon as we got Albert. They just love each other so much.\n\n'Albert is loving with me and Ben when he's home but as soon as my dad is there, he goes straight to him. It's just on another level.\n\n'No matter how many people come round, if my dad is there, he will have all of Albert's attention. And my dad would do anything for Albert.\n\n'Nobody can believe how they are with each other. It's very sweet.\n\n'It's really lovely to see how close they are and it's a huge comfort to us knowing Albert is being so loved while we're at work.'\n\nThe 15-month-old stays with grandad David Street when his owner Jodi is at work. 'He's very stubborn. Everyone who knows him and have seen the video have just said that's just typical Albert. He's definitely one of a kind,' Jodi said\n\nEveryone Jodi knows who has seen the video of her pup refusing to go home has been left in stitches with friends commenting that it's 'typical Albert' as he's known for his stubbornness.\n\nJodi said: 'Albert has a massive massive personality. He's mental. He does zoomies every night for an hour between 7-8.\n\n'He's had a lot of health problems and allergies so he can only eat porridge. He's a very high maintenance dog. He's the best and hardest thing to happen to our lives.\n\n'He's also very stubborn. Everyone who knows him and have seen the video have just said that's just typical Albert. He's definitely one of a kind.\n\n'Everyone has been in stitches watching the video. They think it's hilarious.'", "description": "Albert  is owned by Jodi Street from Guildford, Surrey, but has a special bond with Jodi's dad, David Street.
