That energy is used for lots of things, like powering the brain, fueling physical activity, and supporting your immune system.\n\nFor the first couple years of your life, any energy that\u2019s left over is used for growing your brain and your muscles and your bones. Infants need to double their birth weight within six months. But if you don\u2019t have energy left over, that growth doesn\u2019t happen as it should. You become stunted.\n\nThe most obvious reason why is because you don\u2019t get enough of the right food over a long period of time. But there are a few less intuitive causes of stunting. A deeper understanding of one of those reasons \u2013 the microbiome of the human body \u2013 is why I believe we\u2019re going to solve malnutrition within 20 years.\n\nAll of us rely on our body\u2019s microbiome to function properly. We have more microbial cells living inside our bodies than human cells. These bacteria protect us from infection and are particularly essential to digestion. For example, your body literally cannot break down certain types of plant fibers without an assist from the bacteria in your gut.\n\nWe\u2019re still in the relatively early stages of research into the microbiome. Over the next 10 to 20 years, we\u2019re going to learn more about each individual microbial species and how they work with the food you eat to impact health. That knowledge will allow us to smartly engineer interventions that \u201ccorrect\u201d the microbiome when it\u2019s out of whack.\n\nYou\u2019re probably familiar with one of these interventions: probiotics. In the future, we\u2019ll be able to create next-generation probiotic pills that contain ideal combinations of bacteria \u2013 even ones that are tailored to your specific gut.\n\nAnother intervention could be what\u2019s called \u201cmicrobiota directed complementary foods.\u201d Think of them as being like fertiliser for the microbiome. Eating them encourages healthy bacteria \u2013 the ones that help digest food and protect us from infection \u2013 to flourish.", "description": "I get asked a lot what I would choose if I could only solve one problem.", "authors": ["Bill Gates", "Daniel Berman"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/12/27/TELEMMGLPICT000184384196-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq-wioWl5aH7fAEJ8IWJw2Y-B8VXEHCs73yexWqFsf2H4.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
