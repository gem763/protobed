Elijah Cummings Has Died at 68", "language": "en", "text": "BALTIMORE\u2014Maryland Rep. Elijah E. Cummings died early Thursday at Johns Hopkins Hospital due to complications from longstanding health challenges, his congressional office said. He was 68.\n\nA sharecropper\u2019s son, Mr. Cummings became the powerful chairman of a U.S. House committee that investigated President Trump, and was a formidable orator who passionately advocated for the poor in his black-majority district, which encompasses a large portion of Baltimore as well as more well-to-do suburbs.\n\nAs chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Mr. Cummings led multiple investigations of the president\u2019s dealings, including probes in 2019 relating to the Mr. Trump\u2019s family members serving in the White House.\n\nMr. Trump responded by criticizing the Democrat\u2019s district as a \u201crodent-infested mess\u201d where \u201cno human being would want to live.\u201d The comments came weeks after Mr. Trump drew bipartisan condemnation following his calls for Democratic congresswomen of color to get out of the U.S. \u201cright now,\u201d and go back to their \u201cbroken and crime-infested countries.\u201d\n\nMr. Cummings replied that government officials must stop making \u201chateful, incendiary comments\u201d that only serve to divide and distract the nation from its real problems, including mass shootings and white supremacy.\n\n\u201cThose in the highest levels of the government must stop invoking fear, using racist language and encouraging reprehensible behavior,\u201d he said in a speech at the National Press Club.\n\nMr. Cummings\u2019 long career spanned decades in Maryland politics. He rose through the ranks of the Maryland House of Delegates before winning his congressional seat in a special election in 1996 to replace former Rep. Kweisi Mfume, who left the seat to lead the NAACP.\n\nHe continued his rise in Congress. In 2016, he was the senior Democrat on the House Benghazi Committee, which he said was \u201cnothing more than a taxpayer-funded effort to bring harm to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign\u201d for president.\n\nHe was an early supporter of Barack Obama\u2019s presidential bid in 2008.\n\nThroughout his career, Mr. Cummings used his fiery voice to highlight the struggles and needs of inner-city residents. He was a firm believer in some much-debated approaches to help the poor and addicted, such as needle exchange programs as a way to reduce the spread of AIDS.\n\nElijah E. Cummings was born on Jan. 18, 1951. In grade school, a counselor told him he was too slow to learn and spoke poorly, and he would never fulfill his dream of becoming a lawyer.\n\nThat steeled Mr. Cummings to prove that counselor wrong. He became not only a lawyer but one of the most powerful orators in the Maryland House of Delegates, where he entered office in 1983. He rose to become House speaker pro tempore, the first black delegate to hold the position. He would begin his comments slowly, developing his theme and raising the emotional heat until it became like a sermon from the pulpit.\n\nMr. Cummings was quick to note the differences between Congress and the Maryland General Assembly, which has long been controlled by Democrats.\n\n\u201cAfter coming from the state where, basically, you had a lot of people working together, it\u2019s clear that the lines are drawn here,\u201d he said about a month after entering office in Washington in 1996.\n\nMr. Cummings chaired the Congressional Black Caucus from 2003 to 2004, employing a hard-charging, explore-every-option style to put the group in the national spotlight.\n\nHe cruised to big victories in the overwhelmingly Democratic district, which had given Maryland its first black congressman in 1970 when Parren Mitchell was elected.", "description": "U.S. Rep.
