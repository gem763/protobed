As long as it tastes good, I will shovel it into my gob. Yum yum yum. Down into the tum. As long as it doesn\u2019t make me vomit, make me shit, or give me the tremors, I consider that a meal fit to masticate and absorb into the body as sustenance. And that\u2019s because, from an early age, a deep distrust of selective diets was drilled into me by the most baffling, frustrating, most utterly bullshit picky eaters of them all: The Pizza Trolls from The Logical Journey of the Zoombinis.\n\nThat the Pizza Trolls even existed in the first place, let alone whipped into the kind of famished frenzy that they were, defies all logic \u2013 a grand irony given the title of the game itself.\n\nLook at these smarmy shits, grizzling at you through their awful woody maws.\n\nThree anthropomorphic tree stumps \u2013 apparently named \u201cArno,\u201d \u201cWilla,\u201d and \u201cShyler\u201d \u2013 handed sentience, functional limbs, and apparently fully-formed language centres, who instead chose to squander those gifts by sitting in a muddy ravine and having a big fucken sook.\n\nThese woody assholes had no appreciation for how good they had it.\n\nSpending their entire lives no more than two feet from a magical pizza tower, the Pizza Trolls chose to a) never bother to learn how to use it, b) never bother to learn what anything tastes like, and c) rely on the off chance a hoard of cursed, armless, blue dickbags rolled through so they could bully them into doing it all for them.\n\nHow these starving idiots never once managed to learn that pushing any one of the five buttons gets them delicious pizza within seconds is beyond me. Worse still, how they get themselves to a point where they\u2019re holding things hostage because of it is some insane shit.\n\nREAD MORE How To Play All Of Those Old Games You Miss So Freaking Much\n\nI\u2019ll eat anything when I\u2019m that hungry. I don\u2019t care. Shovel three-day old dry bread into my mouth, who gives a shit. Let me lick a bag of flour. I once took a flick knife and hocked lumps of pure cream cheese into my disgusting mouth like I was a frontier prospector whittling a tent peg. If I had a giant machine that farted pizza out of its top butt with little-to-no apparent need to ever replenish ingredients, I\u2019d make my life on pizza. I\u2019d build houses out of it. I\u2019d end world hunger. I\u2019d roam the streets benevolently handing pizza out to the masses.\n\nNever, not once in my life, have I gotten so furiously hungry that I\u2019ve falsely imprisoned another living being until they chucked a self-saucing pud into the microwave that is in my house.\n\nThese soppy shits lie about waiting for Zoombinis \u2013 all of whom just looking to get to the end of the path so they can die in peace \u2013 so they can piss and bitch moan about wanting \u201cmore toppings\u201d or that \u201csomething on there I don\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nOne of the options is \u201cblank\u201d you drippy turds. It\u2019s hot Italian yum sauce on a crispy bread. What\u2019s wrong there? You can\u2019t just shut the fuck up and eat that?\n\nGive me a break.", "description": "The awful Pizza Trolls from The Logical Journey of the Zoombinis are a terrible breed of tree people that should've eaten what they got given and liked it.", "authors": ["Cam Tyeson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/zoombini-pizza-troll.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
