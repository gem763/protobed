(Nicki Kohl/Telegraph Herald via AP)\n\nOn the sixth day of his trial, an Iowa jury found hog farmer Todd M. Mullis, 43, guilty of murdering his wife with a corn rake.\n\nSince her death in November 2018, Mullis had claimed it was just an accident. Amy Mullis had fallen upon the rake while doing chores in a shed on the family farm, Todd told authorities.\n\nBut coroners took just two days to rule her death a homicide. The corn rake had four tines, but there were six puncture wounds in Amy\u2019s back, which meant that she couldn\u2019t have fallen and landed on it like her husband had suggested. Someone had repeatedly impaled her, on purpose.\n\nMullis, prosecutors would later say, had been enraged for months over an affair his wife was having.\n\nAuthorities eventually arrested and charged Todd Mullis with his wife\u2019s murder, and on Monday a jury in Dubuque County, where the trial was moved due to publicity, found him guilty of first-degree murder -- a charge that carries a mandatory life sentence without parole in Iowa.\n\nDefense attorney Gerald \u201cJake\u201d Feuerhelm told the Telegraph Herald that they planned to appeal the jury\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll sort things out and talk to Todd about that and go from there,\u201d Feuerhelm told the newspaper.\n\n\n\nTodd Mullis, 43, testifies during his trial on Sept. 19, 2019 in Dubuque, Iowa, for the murder of his wife, Amy Mullis, 39. (Dave Kettering/Telegraph Herald via AP)\n\nIowa District Judge Thomas Bitter read the verdict, reported the Telegraph Herald, and Amy Mullis\u2019 family embraced and wept. Tears fell on the face of Jeff Fuller, Amy\u2019s brother, as he told reporters the family would have no further comments on the case, according to the Telegraph Herald.\n\nFuller testified on the first day of Jeff\u2019s trial that his sister had desperately wanted to get away from the family\u2019s hog farm.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t life in rural Earlville, Iowa, that was getting to her. The 39-year-old loved hunting, fishing and spending time outdoors and had left her job as a registered nurse so that she could help out in the barn, her brother testified in court on Tuesday. But her husband, Todd Mullis, was allegedly so controlling that Amy\u2019s friends called her \u201cPOT,\u201d short for \u201cPrisoner of Todd.\u201d As soon as all their crops were out of the field, she told her brother in August 2018, she planned on leaving him and filing for divorce. Todd, she predicted, was going to \u201cflip out.\u201d\n\nThat November, as the fall harvest came to an end, Amy\u2019s 13-year-old son found her slumped over in a small red shed on the family\u2019s property, the pitchfork-like corn rake sticking out of her back.\n\nAt first, Todd blamed his wife\u2019s death on a freak accident. \u201cHe hoped people would feel sorry for him and not ask any more questions,\u201d State Prosecutor Marie Hughes said last week.\n\nBut his explanation \u2014 that Amy had fallen and landed on the corn rake \u2014 quickly fell apart under scrutiny, police said.\n\nDuring opening statements Tuesday, Todd\u2019s attorney, Jake Feuerhelm, argued that while there was no doubt Amy had been \u201cviciously and deliberately murdered,\u201d there was plenty of reason to question whether his client was the person who killed her. But prosecutors contend that the hog-and-soybean farmer had an obvious motive: Not only was he angry that his wife was having an affair and wanted to end their 14-year marriage, he also feared losing half his land and potentially millions of dollars if she filed for divorce.\n\n\u201cBeing a farmer means everything to him. He has put his life into that farm,\u201d Hughes told the jury. \u201cThe defendant had to find a way to keep his farm.\u201d\n\nThe couple\u2019s marriage had been on the rocks since at least 2013, when Todd discovered that Amy was cheating on him. Her friends later told police that he became paranoid, requiring her to keep him apprised of her movements when she left the farm to shop at Walmart or meet a friend for lunch. Then, several months before her death, Amy started flirting with a man who serviced hog operations in the area and regularly stopped by their farm. At first, the two mostly talked about animal feed and the livestock business, but their relationship eventually turned sexual.\n\nThe man told police that Amy said she wanted to leave Todd, but she feared what would happen if he learned about the affair, explaining, \u201cIf he catches me, he might make me disappear.\u201d According to court records obtained by WOI-DT, she had expressed similar fears to several close friends, at one point predicting Todd would kill her and \u201cthrow her to the pigs\u201d if he learned about her infidelity.\n\nIn August 2018, the same month she told her brother, Jeff Fuller, that she planned on leaving her marriage, Amy told a friend that she and Todd had recently purchased a plot of wooded land. If she ever disappeared, she said, police should look for her body there.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll know Todd did something to me,\u201d she said.\n\nNEW TRIAL: Jury selection begins this morning in the IA v. #ToddMullis trial.

During that same period, Amy had texted a friend to say things were \u201cstill very tense around here.\u201d In October 2018, she called up another friend crying and screaming because Todd had gotten wind of her covert affair.\n\nAfter a light breakfast on Nov. 10, 2018, Todd and his 13-year-old son went out to ready the hog barn for a delivery of small pigs. Amy, who was recovering from a recent surgery, joined them but soon started feeling dizzy. Todd repeatedly urged her to go back to the house and rest, but she insisted she wanted to help out. Finally, he suggested a less taxing chore: She could get their old pet carrier out of the shed for a litter of orphaned kittens that had taken up residence in the workshop.\n\nLater in the morning, Todd asked his son to check on Amy. He told police that he had stepped out for a drink of water, noticed that the pet carrier wasn\u2019t there and wondered what was going on.\n\nThe 13-year-old testified Tuesday that his father had left the barn for a brief period before sending him to check on his mother, but he couldn\u2019t say how long he\u2019d been gone. Prosecutors contend Todd wanted the teenager to discover his mother\u2019s body so that her death would look like an accident.\n\nOn Tuesday, Feuerhelm said the story about an accident hadn\u2019t been a lie, but an \u201chonest, legitimate on-the-spot explanation\u201d based on facts available at the time. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t something he manufactured, it was like, what else could it be?\u201d the attorney said.\n\nBut the inconsistency wasn\u2019t the only thing that prompted authorities to charge Todd with first-degree murder in February. According to a police affidavit, he had used his iPad to search the Internet for terms such as \u201corgans in the body,\u201d \u201ckilling unfaithful women,\u201d \u201cwhat happens to cheaters in history\u201d and \u201cwhat happened to cheating spouses in historic Aztec tribes.\u201d He had also initially denied confronting Amy about her affair in the months leading up to her death, then changed his story.\n\nCourt records show Amy told a friend that if she and her husband split up, she stood to gain $2 million from the farm trust, as well as half the couple\u2019s valuable land holdings. Prosecutors argue Todd was hellbent on making sure that didn\u2019t happen. When Amy\u2019s stepmother testified in court Tuesday, she recalled that back in 2013, Todd told her he knew about his wife\u2019s infidelity. But he wasn\u2019t willing to let it end their marriage.\n\nThe stepmother recalled in court what he said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to lose my farm and what I worked for.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump responds to 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg with a sarcastic late-night tweet\n\nA revenge-seeking fitness expert created 369 fake Instagram accounts and staged a kidnapping\n\nGucci\u2019s straitjackets draw a model\u2019s silent protest on the runway: \u2018Mental health is not fashion\u2019", "description": "Todd Mullis, 43, faces life in prison without parole.", "authors": ["Antonia Noori Farzan", "Reporter For The Morning Mix", "Katie Mettler", "Reporter Covering Breaking News", "September At Am", "Antonia Noori Farzan Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
