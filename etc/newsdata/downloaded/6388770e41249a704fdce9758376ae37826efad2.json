While your browser will eventually do this for you, I recommend forcing the issue by clicking the hamburger icon, clicking on \u201cHelp,\u201d and then clicking on \u201cAbout Firefox.\u201d And while Firefox 70 downloads to your desktop or laptop, here\u2019s a quick look at what\u2019s new.\n\nSaving even more of your Mac\u2019s battery\n\nThanks to some improvements in Firefox\u2019s compositing pipeline \u2014 which you can read about here, if you want the geeky details \u2014 the browser now uses a lot less power than ever before, a 3x improvement in some cases. I think this illustration from Mozilla says it all:\n\nAnd if you\u2019re curious whether Firefox\u2019s improvements \u2014 switching to partial compositing \u2014 are live on other platforms, Mozilla had this to say:\n\n\u201cFirefox uses partial compositing on some platforms and GPU combinations, but not on all of them. Notably, partial compositing is enabled in Firefox on Windows for non-WebRender, non-Nvidia systems on reasonably recent versions of Windows, and on all systems where hardware acceleration is off. Firefox currently does not use partial compositing on Linux or Android.\u201d\n\nRead a report of all the trackers Firefox blocks for you\n\nNot only is Firefox now blocking cross-site tracking cookies on social sites like LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter \u2014 a brand-new feature \u2014 but you can now view your very own Privacy Protections report that shows you everything Firefox has been blocking in the background. To view it, simply click on the shield icon next to your address bar and select \u201cShow report.\u201d\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nNot only will you get a somewhat detailed breakdown of how many trackers Firefox blocked over the past week, but you\u2019ll also get a quick overview of how many data breaches the email address associated with your Firefox account has been involved in lately \u2014 if you also sign up for that free feature.\n\nPhoto: David Murphy\n\nIf you want to be a real baller, I recommend setting about:protections as your browser homepage within Firefox\u2019s settings (in the Home section). That way, whenever you click the home icon \u2014 or tap ALT+Home on your keyboard \u2014 you\u2019ll be able to jump right to your privacy report. I figure that\u2019s more useful than a blank page, right?\n\nMake even more secure passwords for sites\n\nFirefox is making it even easier to generate secure passwords for new accounts (or pipe in your older, saved, secure passwords when you\u2019re logging in) via the browser\u2019s Lockwise feature. As Mozilla writes:\n\n\u201cNow, when you create an account you\u2019ll be auto-prompted to let Lockwise generate a safe password, which you can save directly in the Firefox browser. For current accounts, you can right click in the password field to access securely generated passwords through the fill option. All securely generated passwords are auto-saved to your Firefox Lockwise account.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty standard inclusion for any kind of password manager. What I also like, though, is the redesigned Lockwise dashboard, which you can access by clicking on the hamburger icon and clicking on \u201cLogins and Passwords.\u201d\n\nNot only does this screen make it easy to delete, create, and update your passwords, but you\u2019ll also receive a notification if any passwords currently stored in Lockwise have been involved in any kind of data breach. It\u2019s analogous to 1Password\u2019s Watchtower feature, which I love.\n\nEven more Windows users get webrender\n\nYou might not know what webrender is, but you\u2019ll feel its effects if you can use it \u2014 improved performance and stability as a result of your GPU rendering web content instead of your CPU. In Firefox 70, even more Windows users are going to get a chance to use webrender, as Mozilla has opened the feature up to those running Intel integrated graphics and a display resolution lower than 1920-by-1200 pixels.", "description": "It\u2019s time to update to a brand-new version of Firefox Quantum.
