It was at those Senate hearings, that Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of trying to rape her at a house party in 1982 in a gripping testimony that sparked many women to come forward with their own stories about sexual assault.\n\nDuring the hearings, Kavanaugh had suggested that Ramirez\u2019s accusations would have been \u201cthe talk of campus\u201d if they were true. The Times\u2019 report alleges that it was.\n\nPer the Times:\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\n\u201cAt least seven people, including Ms. Ramirez\u2019s mother, heard about the Yale incident long before Mr. Kavanaugh was a federal judge. Two of those people were classmates who learned of it just days after the party occurred, suggesting that it was discussed among students at the time.\u201d\n\nKavanaugh has emphatically denied any and all allegations of sexual assault. He did not speak to the Times about their latest report, because they could not agree on terms for an interview, the newspaper stated.\n\nThe Times report also surfaced similar, yet previously unreported, allegations that Kavanaugh had his pants down at a different college party, where his friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student. According to the report, classmate Max Stier witnessed the incident and alerted senators and the F.B.I. about this account. The report claims the agency did not investigate and Stier has declined to speak about the incident publicly.\n\nThe report also states the F.B.I. interviewed none of the 25 individuals, brought by Ramirez\u2019s legal team to the agency\u2019s attention, who may have had corroborating evidence in her allegations. Additionally, many of those potential witnesses named by Ramirez \u201ctried in vain\u201d to reach the F.B.I. on their own, The Times said.\n\nPer the newspaper:\n\nTwo F.B.I. agents interviewed Ms. Ramirez, telling her that they found her \u201ccredible.\u201d But the Republican-controlled Senate had imposed strict limits on the investigation. \u201c\u2018We have to wait to get authorization to do anything else,\u2019\u201d Bill Pittard, one of Ms. Ramirez\u2019s lawyers, recalled the agents saying. \u201cIt was almost a little apologetic.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Democrats were convinced the F.B.I. investigation into the allegations was rigged in Kavanaugh\u2019s favor and manipulated by the White House. The agency did not interview Ford or Kavanaugh in the process.\n\nOn Sunday morning, President Donald Trump weighed in on the new and reportedly corroborated allegations, calling them \u201cfalse accusations.\u201d The President said the Department of Justice should \u201ccome to his rescue\u201d and that Kavanaugh \u201cshould start suing people for libel.\u201d\n\nSeveral Democratic candidates for the 2020 presidential election have also been outspoken on the issue, with at least three calling for his impeachment.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro tweeted after the new allegations surfaced that \u201cit\u2019s more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath\u201d and that \u201che should be impeached.\u201d\n\nSen. Kamala Harris tweeted that \u201che was put on the court through a sham process\u201d and that \u201che must be impeached.\u201d\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted that the \u201cnewest revelations are disturbing\u201d and \u201clike the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.\u201d\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke tweeted that \u201cwe know (Kavanaugh) lied under oath\u201d and \u201che should be impeached.\u201d\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar said on ABC\u2019s This Week that she strongly opposed him, \u201cbased on his views on executive power, which will continue to haunt our country, as well as how he behaved, including the allegations that we are hearing more about today.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "A New York Times report has corroborated more details about a sexual misconduct case involving Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.", "authors": ["Sanya Mansoor"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/kavanaugh.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C0px%2C1024px%2C536px&resize=1200%2C628&strip"}
