Most people understand that the Australian Tax Office won\u2019t call you up out of the blue, tell you about a tax debt you\u2019ve never heard of before, and ask you to pay it immediately in the form of iTunes gift cards. But scammers aren\u2019t looking for \u2018most people\u2019, they are looking for vulnerable people who maybe aren\u2019t as savvy or computer literate or as confident. Some research has suggested that scammers deliberately try to sound like scammers to immediately weed out people who might catch on to them.\n\nMost people will recognise that two guys rocking up to your house wearing jackets that say \u201cFederal Police\u201d and holding an EFTPOS machine probably are not there to legitimately collect a tax debt you might have, but all they need is the occasional person who does not recognise this. According to SA Police, some scammers tried to pull this exact routine on a resident of the Adelaide suburb of Salisbury Downs yesterday, but were thwarted when the guy realised they were extremely bogus.\n\nThe man reportedly received an automated call at 3pm informing him that he had a tax debt outstanding and that, as a result, a warrant had been issued for his arrest. Half an hour later, two men in fake AFP jackets rocked up to his house and asked him to pay back the debt with an EFTPOS machine they had conveniently brought with them.\n\nRightfully quite suspicious, the man asked them to provide ID, at which point they promptly fucked off.\n\nPolice described the two men as \u201cof Indian Subcontinental and Asian appearance, one aged in [his] late 20s, the other in his 40s with an American accent\u201d, and are asking anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.", "description": "ATO scammers dressed as AFP officers rocked up to a man's home in Adelaide and asked him to pay a tax debt on an EFTPOS machine.", "authors": ["Ben Mcleay"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/20100120000215982132-original.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
