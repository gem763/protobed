The United States and Saudi Arabia have already blamed Iran, which denies responsibility.", "description": "Oil rose further above $64 a barrel on Monday, supported by doubts about how quickly Saudi Arabia can restore output after a crippling attack this month and a resulting greater focus by investors on supply risks.", "authors": ["Alex Lawler", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432761744&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0WM", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
