REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nHowever, it needs to be approved by the British parliament in order to take effect and Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party does not have a majority in the House of Commons.\n\nBelow are reactions from key players in Britain to the new deal, and some comments from business groups and analysts:\n\nPRIME MINISTER BORIS JOHNSON:\n\n\u201cThis deal represents a very good deal both for the EU and for the UK,\u201d Johnson said during a brief statement to media in Brussels, standing alongside European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\n\u201c... For us in the UK it means that we can deliver a real Brexit that achieves our objectives and it means that the UK leaves whole and entire on October 31.\n\n\u201cI hope very much ... that my fellow MPs (lawmakers) in Westminster do now come together to get Brexit done, to get this excellent deal over the line and to deliver Brexit without any more delay.\n\n\u201cNow is the moment for us to get Brexit done and then together to work on building our future partnership, which I think can be incredibly positive both for the UK and for the EU.\u201d\n\nNORTHERN IRELAND\u2019S DUP PARTY:\n\n\u201cFollowing confirmation from the Prime Minister that he believes he has secured a \u2018great new deal\u2019 with the European Union the Democratic Unionist Party will be unable to support these proposals in parliament,\u201d the DUP said in a statement which outlined its objections to the proposed new greement.\n\n\u201cFor all of these reasons, it is our view that these arrangements would not be in Northern Ireland\u2019s long term interests. Saturday\u2019s vote in parliament on the proposals will only be the start of a long process to get any Withdrawal Agreement Bill through the House of Commons.\u201d\n\nJEREMY CORBYN, LEADER OF THE MAIN OPPOSITION LABOUR PARTY:\n\n\u201cThis sell-out deal won\u2019t bring the country together and should be rejected. The best way to get Brexit sorted is to give the people the final say in a public vote.\u201d\n\nHe said Labour would not vote for the deal in parliament.\n\nNICOLA STURGEON, LEADER OF THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY:\n\n\u201cThe Brexit envisaged by Boris Johnson is one which sees a much looser relationship with the EU when it comes to issues like food standards, environmental protections and workers\u2019 rights.\n\n\u201cScotland did not vote for Brexit in any form, and SNP MPs (lawmakers) will not vote for Brexit in any form.\u201d\n\nJO SWINSON, LEADER OF THE PRO-EU LIBERAL DEMOCRATS:\n\n\u201cThe fight to stop Brexit is far from over. This Brexit deal would be bad for our economy, bad for our public services and bad for our environment.\u201d\n\nNIGEL FARAGE, LEADER OF THE BREXIT PARTY:\n\n\u201cIt binds us into so many other commitments on foreign policy, military policy - a list as long as your arm, and I frankly think it should be rejected.\n\n\u201cWould I rather accept a new European treaty that is, frankly, very bad for us, or would I prefer to have an extension, and a general election? I would always go for the latter option. I genuinely believe that a clean break and being able to be competitive is the absolute key to our future economic success. We cannot do that with this new treaty.\u201d\n\nIAIN DUNCAN SMITH, SENIOR MP, FORMER CONSERVATIVE LEADER, STRONGLY IN FAVOUR OF BREXIT:\n\n\u201cI am reserving my position on this,\u201d he said, adding that he wanted to understand the DUP\u2019s position on some of the details before deciding whether to vote for the deal or not.\n\nJEREMY HUNT, SENIOR MP, FORMER RIVAL TO BORIS JOHNSON IN CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP CONTEST:\n\n\u201cFair play Boris. Many doubted it was possible to do this before Oct. 31st, including me on some occasions, but he has ditched the backstop and brought the deal home. Bravo.\u201d\n\nMICHAEL GOVE, CABINET MINISTER, STRONGLY IN FAVOUR OF BREXIT:\n\nAsked what the government would do if parliament voted against the new deal on Saturday: \u201cWe don\u2019t contemplate defeat. There is a lot in this deal for everyone who wants us to leave in a smooth and orderly fashion.\u201d\n\nADAM MARSHALL, HEAD OF THE BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not forget, we\u2019ve been here before. There is still a long way to go before businesses can confidently plan for the future. Companies across the UK and around the world will be paying close attention to what happens next \u2013 and whether the deal agreed can secure parliamentary support.\n\n\u201cFor business, this deal may be the end of the beginning \u2013 but it is far from the beginning of the end of the Brexit process.\u201d\n\nJONATHAN GELDART, HEAD OF THE INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS:\n\n\u201cAs MPs study the draft deal, they must keep firmly in mind the damage a disorderly exit could cause businesses large and small. A further extension offers no guarantees of avoiding this outcome, but if a passable deal is in touching distance then politicians on all sides should be pragmatic about giving us the time to get there.\n\n\u201cIf the immediate choice is between leaving the EU in an orderly versus a disorderly manner, politicians must be mindful of the longer-term consequences their actions may bring to bear.\u201d\n\nCONSTANTINE FRASER, POLITICAL ANALYST AT INVESTMENT RESEARCH FIRM TS LOMBARD:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a better deal for the Tory right than May\u2019s, because it allows for greater future UK-EU divergence (though it doesn\u2019t make it inevitable); it\u2019s worse for the DUP, because NI is essentially semi-detached from the UK for the foreseeable future and quite likely forever. It\u2019s no longer so much a backstop as the default future status for NI.\n\n\u201cThe main takeaway is that the Conservative party is now committed to this deal, not no-deal, and will campaign for a majority for it if the coming general election takes place before the UK has left the EU.\u201d", "description": "The European Union and the British government have clinched a new deal setting the terms of Britain's exit from the bloc.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441878903&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G17Y", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
