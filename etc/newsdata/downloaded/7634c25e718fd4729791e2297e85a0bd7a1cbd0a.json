The lawmakers released a report on the investigation on Friday.\n\n\u201cIn light of the continued efforts of Russia to undermine American Democracy, IRS must use its full authority to prevent foreign adversaries from again exploiting tax-exempt organizations to undermine American interests,\u201d read a letter from Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Ron Wyden, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, to IRS commissioner Charles Rettig. \u201cIt is incumbent on the IRS to fully investigate the organization\u2019s activities to determine whether the NRA\u2019s tax exemption should be disallowed.\u201d\n\nButina is currently serving 18 months in prison for acting \u201cunder direction of\u201d a Kremlin-backed Russian official identified as Torshin during the last presidential-election cycle to curry favor with American political groups, including the NRA, and promote Russia\u2019s interests in the U.S.\n\nNRA officials spent $6000 of the group\u2019s funds traveling to Moscow in 2015, an amount that staff for the Senate Finance Committee\u2019s Republican chairman, Chuck Grassley, called \u201crelatively insubstantial,\u201d saying it \u201cdoes not raise concerns that the NRA abused its tax-exempt status purposes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis report goes to great lengths to try to involve the NRA in activities of private individuals and create the false impression that the NRA did not act appropriately.
