Russo-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe AFC clubs, who split decisions in the 1971 and \u201877 playoffs, will be meeting for the third time in the last four seasons, with Oakland having won 33-25 at home in 2016 before the Colts returned to California to pick up a 42-28 victory last October.\n\nThe Colts had Andrew Luck at quarterback for those two shootouts. He threw for 239 yards and three touchdowns \u2014 all to tight ends \u2014 in last year\u2019s win.\n\nLuck lost his duel with the Raiders\u2019 Derek Carr in the 2016 meeting, with Carr going for 232 yards and three touchdowns in the win.\n\nThe two combined for 11 TD passes in the two games, with five going to tight ends.\n\nThe Raiders will take the field Sunday with the NFL\u2019s leading pass-catcher among tight ends, Darren Waller, whose 26 receptions rank second among all pass-catchers behind the Los Angeles Chargers\u2019 Keenan Allen (29).\n\nThe Colts, meanwhile, have already allowed two touchdowns to tight ends this season (only three teams have more) and 18 catches to the position (only five teams have more).\n\nStarting in place of Luck \u2014 who abruptly retired in the offseason \u2014 Brissett had arguably the best game of his career in a 27-24 home win over Atlanta in Week 3, throwing for 310 yards and two touchdowns \u2014 one each to Zach Pascal and T.Y. Hilton.\n\n\u201cThey did a good job getting Brissett,\u201d Raiders coach Jon Gruden told the media on a national conference call Wednesday. \u201cNot a lot of teams have a superstar quarterback retire who can turn the ball over to a guy like this. You know, Brissett is a winner. He\u2019s a heck of a player. He\u2019s getting paid well, too. He\u2019s not your average Dayton Flyer like me. I mean, this guy is a hell of a player.\n\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t want to underestimate him at all. He has done an excellent job.\u201d\n\nThe Colts (2-1) might be without Hilton against the Raiders, however. He suffered a quad injury in the Week 2 win over Tennessee, then aggravated it in the first half last week against the Falcons.\n\nHe began this week as a spectator at practice.\n\nWith or without Hilton, the Raiders can expect to see a lot of running back Marlon Mack, who burned them for 132 yards and a pair of touchdowns on 25 carries in last year\u2019s meeting.\n\nAfter ranking among the NFL leaders in rushing defense through two weeks, the Raiders (1-2) watched the Vikings\u2019 Dalvin Cook gash them for 110 yards on just 16 carries in Minnesota\u2019s 34-14 win in Week 3.\n\n\u201cThey are very tough to run on,\u201d Colts coach Frank Reich insisted to reporters Wednesday of the Raiders. \u201cThe first two games, very stout on defense. Very stout up front, and then Dalvin Cook has been, I think, having that kind of day on everybody so far. We expect it to be a good challenge.\n\n\u201cWe think we have a good offensive line and a good running game, but we think they\u2019re a very formidable run defense and it\u2019ll be a good match.\u201d\n\nHaving visited Minnesota last week, the Raiders will be playing outside the Pacific time zone for the second straight game as they continue on a 49-day trek away from their home field.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Jacoby Brissett gets a shot at the Oakland Raiders for the first time in his career Sunday afternoon when the host Indianapolis Colts seek a third straight win in a duel of former playoff combatants and Super Bowl champs.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1433987433&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P051-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
