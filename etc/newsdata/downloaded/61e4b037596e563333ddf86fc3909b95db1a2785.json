The first Zelda game for a portable console, it was missing a number of series mainstays \u2013 no triforce, no ganon \u2026 heck, no Zelda \u2013 and took glee in replacing them with bizarre twists, like the plethora of cameos from other Nintendo games or the ability to steal items from a shopkeeper (incurring the penalty of having your saved game renamed THIEF).\n\nSo it\u2019s delightful to see the game getting a remake after being repeatedly overlooked for re-releases in favour of its more conventional cousins such as Link to the Past and Ocarina of Time. And it is the sort of remake that sets the standard for what we should expect: every single thing fans love about the original game is here, except rather than a four-colour GameBoy screen, it\u2019s beautifully rendered in 3D with another 25 years of Easter eggs added for those dedicated enough to find them.\n\nLink\u2019s Awakening sees Link washed up on shore of the mysterious Koholint Island and tasked with gathering eight magical musical instruments to awaken the Wind Fish and return home. It\u2019s the 2D Zelda formula at its purest: enter dungeon, find item that unlocks path to next dungeon, rinse, repeat. There\u2019s no Link to the Past-style twist here: simply fitting the game as it is on an old GameBoy cartridge was feat enough.\n\nThat means the game, in particular the overworld, is a masterpiece of efficient design, packing as many secrets as possible into any given screen. Which is good, because you\u2019ll be back-tracking a lot, even once you unlock the fast-travel system a few hours in; it\u2019s nice to notice, as you trek a path for the fifth time, that now you can pick up that boulder and see what\u2019s underneath it.\n\nThere are a few more fast-travel points than in the first game \u2013 and more secret seashells to collect, and more heart pieces, and a whole figurine-collecting subgame that is completely ignorable \u2013 but by and large, this really is the same game. If, like me, you played Links Awakening until the cartridge broke, you\u2019ll probably be able to navigate on hazy memories alone.\n\nBut the problem with being such a faithful recreation of a 26-year-old game is, well, it\u2019s still a 26-year-old game. And occasionally it shows. For instance, sometimes the doors will lock in a dungeon and you need to defeat all the enemies to get them to unlock. That\u2019s fine, until you hit some bosses who need bombs to defeat. Bombs you may not have, and which you can\u2019t get in the now-locked room. Time for either a deliberate death or a hard reset!\n\nSome enemies can only be hurt with your spin attack. There is no way of telling which ones these are, short of remembering to try your spin attack in the middle of hectic boss fights \u2013 at the same time as trying the magic dust, and the bombs, and boomerang and arrows and fire rod and everything else \u2013 because this era of Zelda really likes you using the right weapon on the right thing.\n\nSome frustrations have been softened. The extra buttons on the Switch mean that now your sword, shield, power bracelet and Pegasus boots are always equipped once you have them, limiting the endless item-swapping of the GameBoy version (although reducing some previously complex fights to triviality).\n\nOther new introductions have fared less well. Worst is Damp\u00e9, a new character who lets you piece together new dungeons from rooms you\u2019ve previously encountered. Supposedly a mini Zelda Maker, a prototypical twin to Super Mario Maker, it ends up as a horrible grindy mess. You know the solutions to all the puzzles and can\u2019t do anything more interesting, so end up simply finding the minimal new creation required to fulfil each of Damp\u00e9\u2019s challenges, then ambling through the same 10 rooms you use each time, to get a few extra quarter hearts and secret seashells.\n\nLink\u2019s Awakening is a fantastic remake of a game that was fantastic in 1993. Fans must decide for themselves if those two things combine to make it a fantastic game in 2019 \u2013 particularly when the glorious Cadence of Hyrule is also on the Switch to scratch the itch you may have for 2D Zelda \u2013 and at a third of the price.", "description": "Fans of the GameBoy curio will enjoy endless nostalgia with this 3D remake \u2013 but is it too faithful to the original?", "authors": ["Alex Hern"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f80d1b5b54b2a8c66bdf5d61132bd3882ff4f16c/28_68_2047_1230/master/2047.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2b517c5530174e944ddbbd36d8cc291a", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
