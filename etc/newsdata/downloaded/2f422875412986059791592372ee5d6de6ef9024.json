We will fight for righteousness,\" Lee added. \"I put on the mask to tell the government that I\u2019m not afraid of tyranny.\u201d\n\nReuters notes that police fired tear gas at several locations on Sunday, and some protesters threw bricks and Molotov cocktails at officers.\n\nProtests also closed down the city\u2019s financial district on Friday just hours after Lam announced the ban on masks.\n\nThe Associated Press, meanwhile, reported on Sunday that a court has rejected a second attempt to block the ban.\n\nLawmaker Dennis Kwok told the news service that the High Court did agree to consider a request by dozens of legislators opposed to Lam's use of emergency powers.\n\nThe protests began months ago over a proposed law that would\u2019ve allowed the extradition of suspects in Hong Kong to China. While that measure has been withdrawn, protests have expanded to include calls for democracy and Lam's ouster.\n\n--This report was updated at 8:10 a.m.", "description": "Tens of thousands of masked protesters marched through the streets of Hong Kong on Sunday in defiance of a new law.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/hongkong_100619getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
