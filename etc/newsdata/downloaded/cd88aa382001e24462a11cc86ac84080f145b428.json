USA TODAY\n\nPrayers from Kanye West's fans have finally been answered.\n\nWest released his highly anticipated (and highly delayed) \"Jesus Is King\" album Friday, four weeks after his ninth studio album was originally scheduled to drop.\n\nIt was a long, bumpy road to release. The rapper's wife, Kim Kardashian West, first teased the gospel-themed album on social media in late August, revealing a handwritten track list and a Sept. 27 release date.\n\nBut that day came and went without any new music from Kanye.\n\nInstead, West began teasing the album with fan events.The rapper followed his wildly popular Sunday Service concert at Detroit's Aretha Franklin Amphitheater on Sept. 27, his would-be album release day, with a pop-up listening party for a couple thousand zealous fans hours later.\n\nThe rest of the world just had to wait, with Kardashian West instructing the masses to \"have faith,\", sharing a revamped track list via Twitter. On her Instagram Story, she added, \"He's dropping the album Sunday. Just a few final tweaks to the mixes.\"\n\nMore: Kanye West's 'Jesus is King' documentary release date announced, album expected Sunday\n\nBut, no. Much like the original Friday release date, no new music awaited fans who logged on Sept. 29.\n\nInstead, West held another star-studded Sunday Service concert that day at the Greater Allen A.M.E. Cathedral of New York in Queens and previewed new songs at a listening party that evening in Manhattan.\n\nSwizz Beatz, Kim Kardashian West, Saint West, North West, Marvet Britto, Kanye West, Jonathan Cheban, Victory Boyd, and Consequence attend Sunday Service at The Greater Allen A.M.E.

(Photo: Johnny Nunez, WireImage)\n\nHis fans were less than thrilled. \"kanye after lying about 2 albums in 2 years\" read one tweet, accompanied by a snippet of video of West sprinting away from the cameras.\n\n\"How Kanye is sleeping knowing he didn't release Jesus Is King,\" read another, attached to a photo of West sleeping soundly on a couch.\n\nWest pulled a similar stunt last year, teasing the release of a project titled \"Yandhi\" for Black Friday 2018 before failing to drop an album that day and announcing several months later that it had been delayed indefinitely. In the end, nothing came of it.\n\nBut momentum began to rev up again this week. On Sunday, the rapper tweeted a promise his album would drop on Friday. And on Wednesday in Los Angeles, West played the entire record at the Forum \u2013 transforming the concert hall into a wetland marsh \u2013 and screened his companion IMAX film (out Oct. 25), directed by British filmmaker Nick Knight, for the first time.\n\nBy Thursday, 'Ye was finally ready. At least fans thought.\n\n\"'JESUS IS KING' Midnight\" he declared on Twitter, one of his first tweets since New Year's Day.\n\nThen, midnight came and went without a new Kanye album. He tweeted again, thanking fans for their loyalty and patience.\n\n\"To my fans Thank you for being loyal & patient We are specifically fixing mixes on 'Everything We Need' 'Follow God' & 'Water' We not going to sleep until this album is out!' he posted.\n\nTo my fans\n\n\n\nThank you for being loyal & patient\n\n\n\nWe are specifically fixing mixes on \u201cEverything We Need\u201d \u201cFollow God\u201d & \u201cWater\u201d\n\n\n\nWe not going to sleep until this album is out! \u2014 ye (@kanyewest) October 25, 2019\n\nHours later, the record finally descended onto streaming platforms from the (digital) heavens.\n\nContributing: Maeve McDermott, Brian McCollum, Detroit Free Press, Andrea Mandell\n\nSee our full coverage of entertainment news\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/10/25/kanye-west-releases-jesus-king-album-after-many-delays/3826722002/", "description": "Prayers from Kanye West's fans have been answered as the rapper released his highly anticipated (and very delayed)\u00a0\"Jesus Is King\" album Friday.", "authors": ["Cydney Henderson", "Published P.M.
