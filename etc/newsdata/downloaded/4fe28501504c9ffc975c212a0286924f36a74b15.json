So go now, while it\u2019s relatively untouched\n\nIs there such a thing as too much snow? The week I arrived in Champoluc, in Italy\u2019s Valle d\u2019Aosta, the whole village seemed to be buried. Trees resembled sticks of candyfloss, huge mounds hid cars that would take days to dig out, and the air itself was laced with a diaphanous glittery frost.\n\nEach morning a fresh set of hastily printed warning posters was plastered over the walls of the Chalet Hotel Champoluc, which can be booked through Inghams, one of few operators that offer trips to this resort: \u201cHigh avalanche risk today,\u201d read one. \u201cAvoid the area around the church.\u201d\n\nWhen even going to church becomes dangerous, you know things are serious.\n\nWe may be on the cusp of the extinction of winter, but this was one of those freak weeks when there is such a heavy dump the resorts all but grind to a halt.\n\nAt first I was delighted: I had long yearned to ride the famed steep off-piste of the Monterosa ski area, which is all the better in deep powder. I was with a bunch of old friends and our children, whom we\u2019d envisaged would soon master the basics in the resort\u2019s friendly, easygoing ski schools, and make the most of the 180km of varied runs across its three valleys. But it seemed the snow would scupper our plans: ski school was shut, the avalanche risk was too high for heading off-piste, and the connections to the area\u2019s other resorts, Gressoney and Alagna, to the east, were closed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chalet Hotel Champoluc\n\nAt least the main Crest gondola, right next to our hotel, kept rolling, leading to fun blue and red runs fringed by trees, so it was easy for half the adults to hammer a few runs while the others minded the children, then swap. We felt lucky, though, as over the border in Switzerland, just on the other side of the Matterhorn, that iconic peak beneath which Champoluc sits, it was worse, with almost no skiing open in neighbouring Zermatt.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the only reason I felt glad to be on the southern, Italian, side. Zermatt, despite its 120 years of gruff mountaineering history, has become obscenely high-end, an Alpine colossus drawing the world\u2019s wealthy to shop for diamonds and Tag Heuer watches, feast on Michelin stars and bed down in glassy architect-designed super-chalets. In contrast, tiny Champoluc, in its wooded valley, is down-to-earth, low-key and caters mainly for Italians. They come for one brilliant pizzeria, a salumi shop, and a bar that does great panini. It\u2019s easy to meet locals who\u2019ve never even been to Zermatt.\n\nYet these differing worlds could be set to collide, as there are plans to connect the two resorts by lift. Given that Cervinia, at the head of the next valley to the west, is already connected to Zermatt, the link would create Italy\u2019s biggest ski area, and one of the largest in the world.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest On the pistes near Champoluc in the Valle d\u2019Aosta.

Champoluc\u2019s business people are already spooked by increasing winter rain. \u201cThe snowline is rising each winter,\u201d Giorgio Munari, president of local association Monterosa Ski, told me. \u201cThe lower slopes may be unskiable in the future.\u201d\n\nGiven that Monterosa\u2019s highest piste is 3,275 metres, and Zermatt\u2019s 3,883 metres, you can see the logic of being able to access more snow. But despite the plan being approved by local referenda, it is stuck at the discussion and planning stage, partly because of concern over the environmental impact. If it does get the green light, though, things here could change dramatically.\n\nLocal regulations prevent any new houses or chalets being built in Champoluc, yet the opening of its first five-star hotel, Camp Zero, last season, followed by eco-hotel Au Charmant Petit Lac last summer, indicate confidence in potential growth, as does recent investment in the existing lifts.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Monterosa Terme, more like a posh spa than public baths\n\nFor now, though, Champoluc feels quiet and untouched, with just enough of what you need close by \u2013 the atmospheric bar of the century-old Hotel Castor, the Dolce e Salato gelateria (because even in a blizzard, kids want ice-cream) and the sleek public baths of the Monterosa Terme, which are more posh spa than leisure centre, with indoor and outdoor pools, hot tubs and white robes for guests.\n\nThat Champoluc is pretty much just one street seemed wonderfully handy when the snow-drifted pavements were covered in icy pools and heaps of slush.\n\nOn the one night the hotel didn\u2019t provide dinner, we headed out after dark, snow pelting down in huge flakes, but got no further than the restaurant across the road, Lo Bistrot, a place for kid-pleasing pizza, pasta and polenta among noisy Italian families. The night ended with a few lurid yellow bombardinos \u2013 the custardy regional apr\u00e8s ski cocktail of brandy, cream and advocaat egg liqueur \u2013 and dancing in the bar, with the kids dancing on the tables too.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bombardino cocktails, with brandy, cream and advocaat\n\nWe were having fun. Yet at the back of our minds lurked a hunger for the once-in-a-lifetime conditions we knew waited at the top. Surely it was only a matter of time before more lifts opened? Over breakfast we sized each other up, working out whether doing the childcare shift in the morning or afternoon was more likely to land us in the right place at the right time to access the deep powder that had lain untouched for days.\n\nI was in luck. A barrier between Champoluc and Frachey, a few kilometres north, was removed, the Bettaforca chairlift got going, the link to Gressoney reopened and I was riding rolling steeps in waist-deep powder with some of my oldest friends, our faces plastered with snow and silly grins, as a thrilling backcountry playground opened up.\n\nAll the while, the beautiful, gargantuan Matterhorn towered above. Yet I never wished to ride closer and beyond it; I was happy for the mountains on that horizon to still possess an element of mystery.\n\n\u2022 The trip was provided by Inghams , which has a week at Chalet Hotel Champoluc from \u00a3589pp half-board including wine and afternoon tea, flights from London to Turin and transfers.
