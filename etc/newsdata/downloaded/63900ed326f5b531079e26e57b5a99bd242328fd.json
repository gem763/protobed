Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nRudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who enjoyed a brief run as an American hero in the early 2000s, marked the 18th anniversary of 9/11 by tweeting a bizarre, fascistic video at 1:53 a.m. on Wednesday. The only text accompanying the clip: \u201cGOD BLESS AMERICA!\u201d\n\nThe video of a proud police officer preparing to battle left-wing protesters is a lightly edited version of an ad made last year by Grunt Style, a clothing brand whose mission \u201cis to deliver the highest quality, most patriotic apparel on the planet.\u201d The clip went viral with right-wingers who dug the company\u2019s highly obvious marketing gimmick. Grunt Style said the ad, which it released close to the Super Bowl, could have been submitted to run during the game. Instead, it saved the money and pretended to be a victim of the censors.\n\n\u201cThis commercial was intended to be our commercial in the Big Game (you know the one),\u201d Grunt Style says on YouTube. \u201cWe weren\u2019t denied or rejected by anyone, it was our own decision to not run it. In the end we just couldn\u2019t take the big money risk.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise to see Giuliani, who now works as Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, glorifying authoritarianism. The mayor was compared to Mussolini years before 9/11 and has started to emulate his new boss in recent years. But it\u2019s still notable to see him boosting such a blatant piece of divisive propaganda on the anniversary of an event that prompted him, three weeks after 9/11, to say this at the United Nations:\n\nYou can\u2019t walk a block or two blocks in New York City without seeing somebody that looks different than you, acts different than you, talks different than you, believes different than you. If you grow up in New York City you learn that and then you learn something \u2014 if you\u2019re an intelligent or decent person \u2014 you learn that all those differences are nothing in comparison to the things that unite us. We\u2019re a city of immigrants unlike any other city \u2014 within a nation of immigrants. Like the victims of the World Trade Center attack, we\u2019re of every race; we\u2019re of every religion; we\u2019re of every ethnicity; and our diversity has been our greatest source of strength. It\u2019s the thing that renews us and revives us in every generation, our openness to new people from all over the world.", "description": "Rudy Giuliani tweeted out a video that promotes division and authoritarianism, which was produced by the clothing brand grunt style, on the 18th anniversary of 9/11.", "authors": ["Adam K.
