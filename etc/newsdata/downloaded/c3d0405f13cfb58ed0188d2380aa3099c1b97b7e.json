A week ago, I would have bet that the Iran and Saudi Arabia topic would draw a lot of the attention during UNGA, but even this topic is no longer making the news.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOne acknowledgment that the whistleblower scandal was clouding the numerous events surrounding the global forum came during the final Thursday news conference by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, originally billed as a recap of the week\u2019s successes. The first question came from a reporter who said he had planned to ask about UNGA events but that \u201ceverything has been catapulted into another topic down in Washington, so \u00ad\u2014\u201d\n\nAD\n\nUnable to contain his irritation, Pompeo interjected, \u201cOnly because you\u2019ve chosen to catapult it there.\u201d\n\nTrump himself was clearly peeved, sending out a stream of tweets attacking impeachment and the whistleblower.\n\nAfter news broke Tuesday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) would announce impeachment proceedings, Trump seemed to rush through his scheduled meetings, and his motorcade left early to take him back home to Trump Tower. His agenda said he was in \u201cexecutive time\u201d during a period that coincided with Pelosi\u2019s televised remarks. Soon after, he tweeted, \u201cPRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDuring a meeting Thursday with employees of the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, where U.S. Ambassador Kelly Craft took over just weeks ago, leaked audio captured Trump likening those who spoke to the whistleblower to \u201cspies,\u201d and seemingly lamenting the end of an earlier era when spies were executed.\n\nAD\n\nMuch of his ire was directed at the news media. At a news conference Wednesday, he tried to prod reporters into asking about the economy and global affairs instead of impeachment.\n\nEven some reporters were taken aback by the news coverage.\n\nWaiting for Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to arrive at a news conference Thursday, one reporter acknowledged there was little interest in what Rouhani might say, even amid growing tension between Washington and Tehran.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe could declare war and my office wouldn\u2019t care,\u201d the reporter said, also speaking on the condition of anonymity.\n\nWhen Rouhani arrived, the second question he was asked concerned Trump\u2019s future. A slight smile crossed his face, but he demurred from opining, saying, \u201cIt is an internal matter. It is the purview of the United States, the American people and the American Congress. They must decide. The conclusion, whatever it is, is not of importance to us.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut despite fears the United States and Iran may be edging toward war, Rouhani\u2019s speech at the United Nations was not broadcast live on cable television, as it was in previous years. While he spoke, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC all remained fixated on events in Washington.\n\nAD\n\nOne of the few items on the U.N. agenda that broke through was the debate over climate change. That was largely because the high-level speeches were made on Monday, the day before the world\u2019s attention took a U-turn.\n\n\u201cThe news about Ukraine definitely took the spotlight from some of the world leaders who spoke later in the week,\u201d a former U.S. diplomat said, unwilling to be named because of his concerns about partisan backlash. \u201cThe remarks of some of the more bombastic heads of state tend to dominate the public\u2019s attention around the world, so this year\u2019s dynamic was certainly different because of the news from D.C.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPrivately, some diplomats expressed concern and uncertainty about what the scandal means for their countries and relations with the United States. They already are starting to calibrate how Washington\u2019s turn inward will distract from other crises around the world, and even whether they will still be dealing with a Trump administration in a few months\u2019 time. Some also said they were worried that more transcripts of calls between leaders will be made public.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere are now speculations around diplomats if at the end, this impeachment case might help Trump,\u201d said a diplomat for the Middle East. \u201cThe question for us is, if Congress and the White House are now going to be busy with this case, how much might this affect the interest in current increasing security problems we are seeing in the Gulf states?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other problem we see, generally speaking,\u201d the diplomat said, \u201cis what can be discussed with American presidents over the phone in the future, if we have to fear that one day the transcripts could be shared with the public?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut U.N. spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric brushed off a question about how the situation in Washington had affected the work of the General Assembly.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe business of the world continues here,\u201d he said. \u201cVery serious issues continue to be debated, from the Central African Republic to Yemen to Libya to climate change, to sustainable development goals. \u2026 The people who are suffering in the world need us to come up with solutions, and the discussions on those are continuing this week and will continue onwards.\u201d\n\nAnne Gearan and John Hudson contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "As world leaders and diplomats gathered in New York for the annual U.N.
