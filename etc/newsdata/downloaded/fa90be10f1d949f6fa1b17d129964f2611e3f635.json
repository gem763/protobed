REUTERS/Darren Whiteside/File Photo\n\nThe vote had been due next week with the revisions also including penalties for insulting the president\u2019s dignity and a four-year jail term for abortions in the absence of a medical emergency or rape.\n\nIndonesia, the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority country, has substantial Christian, Hindu and Buddhist minorities but has seen a recent trend towards greater religious piety and conservative Islamic activism.\n\n\u201cI have ordered the law and human rights minister to convey this decision to parliament, to delay the confirmation of the criminal code bill,\u201d Widodo told a televised news conference.\n\nThe president said he had decided 14 articles needed further review after receiving input from various groups and ordered his minister \u201cto perfect\u201d the bill before it is deliberated on by the next parliament.\n\nAt a news conference, Law and Human Rights Minister Yasonna Laoly said he would follow the president\u2019s order to clarify some clauses of the bill, while fiercely defending it.\n\nLaoly criticised some media portrayals of the bill, which he described as more lenient than the current Dutch colonial-era set of laws. He said sex outside marriage was only an offence if a parent, child or spouse lodged a complaint or a village chief did so after receiving permission from the family.\n\nAs parliament\u2019s current term ends this month, lawmakers had scrambled to wrap up debates on several bills, including new rules that activists say will strip the anti-corruption agency of its effectiveness.\n\nA new parliament of members elected following April\u2019s legislative vote begins its term next month.\n\nHundreds of students staged protests outside parliament on Thursday against the proposed changes to the criminal code.\n\nTempo newspaper on Friday likened the planned revisions to a return to the \u201cNew Order\u201d of former authoritarian ruler Suharto, who curbed free speech and allowed cronies and his family to control big chunks of the economy.\n\nThe Institute for Criminal Justice Reform, a non-government organisation, welcomed the delay and urged the government to set up an expert panel to ensure a new draft is \u201cin line with the principles of constitutional democracy\u201d and has wide public support.\n\n\u201cIndonesia\u2019s draft criminal code is disastrous not only for women and religious and gender minorities, but for all Indonesians,\u201d said Andreas Harsono, senior Indonesia researcher at Human Rights Watch.\n\n\u201cLawmakers should remove all the abusive articles before passing the law.\u201d\n\nThe planned revisions had also spurred neighbour Australia to update its travel advice, warning citizens of risks they faced from sex outside marriage or same-sex relations in Indonesia if the new rules take effect.\n\nAustralians are among the leading visitors to the holiday island of Bali and the country\u2019s Daily Telegraph newspaper carried a lurid headline on Friday: \u201cBali Sex Ban\u201d.", "description": "Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Friday ordered a delay in a parliamentary vote on a new penal code criminalising sex outside marriage and same-sex relations, which has been criticised by rights groups as an assault on basic freedoms.", "authors": ["Gayatri Suroyo", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431971648&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J10H", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
