Instead, it focuses on reducing America\u2019s extremely heavy reliance on China for so much of its manufacturing needs.\n\nEven if China\u2019s economy weren\u2019t so closed off to so many American goods and services, a strong argument has long been made that the U.S. needs to diversify its sources for imports. While finding those new sources wouldn\u2019t necessarily do anything to dent America\u2019s trade imbalances, it would reduce the risks of a major disruption to the U.S. economy based on disputes or other problems connected to a single foreign country.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jake Novak", "Cnbc.Com Tariffs-Are-No-Longer-Chinas-Biggest-Problem-In-The-Trade-War.Html"], "top_image": ""}
