Some are so afraid of shelling out cash that they\u2019re pulling out all the stops, with one man even seen driving around in his car with a helmet on. But one man in the city of Vadodara in Gujarat has outdone them all, proving that Indians truly are the masters of jugaad (hacks).\n\nInsurance agent Ram Shah has stuck his licence and other documents like registration certificate, Pollution Under Check (PUC) certificate and insurance slip on his helmet. Probably because his profession requires him to do everything to ensure that money is not wrongly given out, Shah decided that the best way to avoid coughing up cash was to quite literally stick to the rules.\n\n\n\n\"This way I am never hassled on the road and I don\u2019t have to pay any fine ever,\u201d he told India Today. In an interview with ANI, he said \u201cAfter seeing my helmet, I was once approached by a traffic police officer who appreciated me. It serves two purposes, I will never forget my documents at home and it will also encourage people to wear a helmet while driving.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Gujarat government is working towards stricter implementation of the new rules but also reducing the fine rates on humanitarian grounds.\n\nFollow Shamani Joshi on Instagram.", "description": "Afraid of paying a heavy penalty under the stringent new Motor Vehicles Act, Ram Shah has come up with a unique solution to save money.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d78e46d9a79ac000851b7f2/lede/1568203907886-Gujarat-man-sticks-license-on-helmet-to-avoid-fine.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
