Today Hulu announced it was finally adding the ability to download shows to view offline, following the feature\u2019s addition to Amazon Prime Video and Netflix years ago. The feature is coming to iOS first, and Android users \u2018soon.\u2019\n\nWhile in an ideal world we\u2019d all be able to watch streaming video at perfect quality at any time, the reality is often far from that. Whether you\u2019re on an airplane, your gym has spotty wi-fi, or you don\u2019t want to use your mobile data on the go, there is a myriad of reasons you might want to download videos to watch later.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s often simply to be able to watch videos at maximum quality with no buffering. Few things are worse than when a show pauses to buffer in the middle of an intense scene.\n\nThere are some caveats. In Hulu\u2018s own words:\n\nViewers can download up to 25 titles across 5 different devices and will have up to 30 days to watch their downloaded content. For watched content, the download will expire two days after starting playback. After downloaded content expires, viewers can renew an expired download when online, if that content is still available on Hulu.\n\nAdditionally, the plan is only available for viewers on the company\u2019s No Ads plan, so you\u2019ll have to pay extra if you\u2019re on the cheaper subscription.\n\nStill, it\u2019s a welcome update. Android users will have to sit tight for a while longer, but iOS users can update to the latest version of the app to try out the new feature.\n\nRead next: Researchers discover quantum vibrations at room temperature", "description": "", "authors": ["Napier Lopez"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FSnag_84e67777.png&signature=411cc0108f976b63fe712493d97a9342", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
