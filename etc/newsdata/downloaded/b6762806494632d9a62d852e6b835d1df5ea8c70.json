People may not have responded to it as much in another period.\u201d\n\nFrom Trust to The Romanoffs: how TV's family sagas got serious Read more\n\nBut Jesse Armstrong, Succession\u2019s showrunner, was stumped as to why it had struck a chord on both sides of the Atlantic. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cGod only knows why that happens.\u201d\n\nSuccession, a melodrama about a media clan, the Roys, who jostle for position as their father\u2019s health falters, has become a pop culture darling, inspiring thinkpieces on everything from its Greek and Roman references to its incredible array of knitwear. It won Armstrong an Emmy for best writing for a drama series.\n\nThe show lacks any obviously redeemable character. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I like any of them,\u201d said Prebble, adding that Shiv Roy, the duplicitous daughter and political adviser, was the most fun to write. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be friends with any of them.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Succession writer Lucy Prebble says Shiv Roy was the most fun character to create. Photograph: HBO\n\nPrebble and Armstrong say the Roys were inspired by \u201ccorporate or dynastic families all over the world\u201d rather than any one particular family. Armstrong encourages everyone in the writers\u2019 room to read the Financial Times, Vanity Fair and New York Magazine to look out for stories about certain families.\n\n\u201cThe Redstones, the Murdochs, the Roberts [who own Comcast], the Smiths [who own the Sinclair Group of conservative TV stations in the US], and obviously the Trumps,\u201d he said. \u201cWe take from everywhere and then put it through the lens of our particular characters.\u201d\n\nOne figure from the Trump clan did fascinate them, said Prebble. \u201cWe always talked a lot about Donald Trump Jr and his childhood. Quite a lot of it is heartbreaking, but even knowing what they\u2019ve been through it\u2019s still very difficult to feel pity for these people.\u201d\n\nAnother clear inspiration is the Murdoch clan, who aren\u2019t the show\u2019s biggest fans. \u201cI don\u2019t watch Succession \u2026 why would I?\u201d James Murdoch, who is thought to have inspired Jeremy Strong\u2019s character, Kendall Roy, told the New Yorker.\n\nBrian Cox, who plays the bellicose, power-hungry patriarch, Logan Roy, said he was stopped in the street in London by a man who told him he was enjoying the show but his wife found it hard to watch. When Cox asked why, the man \u2013 Keith Tyson, the Turner prize winning artist \u2013 explained he was married to Elisabeth Murdoch, the daughter of Rupert and sister of the Fox Corporation CEO, Lachlan Murdoch.\n\nFor Prebble, any denials from the Murdochs are a positive signal. \u201cIf something is genuinely biting and satirical then the subjects pretend they haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Trump has the attention span to watch a whole episode.\u201d\n\nSuccession's Kieran Culkin on villainy, Home Alone \u2013 and Michael Jackson Read more\n\nThe Washington Post TV critic Alyssa Rosenberg says the appeal of Succession is rooted in schadenfreude, as viewers who feel powerless to stop abuses of power in the real world can enjoy some recompense via their TV. \u201cIt\u2019s weirdly reassuring in that it tells you over and over again that these people might act with impunity but it\u2019s OK because eventually they will destroy themselves,\u201d she said.\n\nMiles Surrey, who has written about Succession for the Ringer, thinks its message of privileged misery has landed with an audience that is looking for clear condemnation of the 1% and its lifestyle. \u201cThe Roy kids are raised with a silver spoon that can lead to cool things like helicopter rides and private jets,\u201d he said. \u201cBut their wealth comes at the expense of being psychologically tormented by a father who is incapable of loving his own children.\u201d\n\nAccording to Prebble, when wealthy consultants came in to give them guidance on the super rich, they would never be able to answer the question: what happens when you\u2019ve earned enough money? \u201cEvery time they would look at us blankly and say that really doesn\u2019t happen. People who are driven to be that wealthy, there isn\u2019t an amount at which they stop.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Succession follow the lives of super-rich media clan, the Roys. Photograph: HBO\n\nArmstrong said: \u201cI go away from those meetings with this buzzing sense that you\u2019ve unlocked this world, then I look at my notes and it says something like \u2018rich people like lobster\u2019. Meeting these people is important but actually if you read the books about Maxwell or Murdoch they\u2019re full of amazing stories.\u201d\n\nViewing figures for Succession are not remarkable \u2013 it debuted with 1.2 million in the US for its second season premiere, compared with the record-breaking 19.3 million viewers who tuned in for the Game of Thrones finale.\n\nBut when compared to similarly critically adored shows such as Mad Men, which pulled in 3.3 million viewers for its finale in the US, Succession has done enough to convince HBO to greenlight a third season. HBO praised the show\u2019s exploration of wealth, power and family and said it had \u201cresonated powerfully with audiences\u201d.\n\nRosenberg believes it is too early to say if the show can emulate previous prestige dramas such as Mad Men and The Sopranos, which influenced everything from fashion to other TV. \u201cI have read about a dozen posts about Shiv\u2019s style but I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to have a Succession line of clothes in Banana Republic any time soon,\u201d she said. \u201cThe old-fashioned has an inherent sexiness, and Mad Men revived that, but the cable knit sweater is a little bit of a harder sell.\u201d", "description": "The Roy family\u2019s privileged misery gives viewers the justice they crave in real life", "authors": ["Lanre Bakare"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe34892ef2fdc639b7e591e97af38ba080378333/0_166_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c60ef0ddbe236accc23b8b78bfcd5955", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
