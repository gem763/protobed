Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index added 8.64 points, or 0.3%, to finish at 3,009.57, while the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 24.79 points, or 0.3%, to end at 8,194.47.\n\nThursday\u2019s action left the Dow 0.6% from its record at 27,359.16 hit on July 15, while the S&P 500 was 0.5% from its all-time high at 3,025.86 set on July 26. The Nasdaq ended the day 1.6% from its all-time closing high at 8,330.21 also hit on July 26.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving the market?\n\nRetail sales grew faster than expected in August, up 0.4%, and were up 4.1% year-on-year, the U.S. Commerce Department said on Friday. The rise was driven entirely by purchases of new cars and trucks though, as retail sales ex-autos were flat. Strong demand for big-ticket items like automobiles suggests the U.S. consumer remains confident about his future prospects.\n\n\u201cThis morning\u2019s number is above expectations but more importantly it\u2019s the sixth straight month of positive growth for retail sales which is a really encouraging,\u201d wrote Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E-Trade Financial in an email. \u201cWith holiday spending on the horizon and inflation at bay, we could continue to see momentum in the retail sector. A healthy consumer can help inject some energy into other sectors of the economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat said, trade tensions are a key focal point and rising tariffs between the US and China could threaten this critical indicator, Loewengart added.\n\nSoftening trade tensions between the U.S. and China, with the hope of formal negotiations restarting early next month, and easy-money policies being undertaken by global central banks have all helped to momentarily quell many investors\u2019s fears that a near-term recession will grip the U.S. economy. Beijing made further concessions to the U.S. on international trade on Friday, adding agricultural products like soybeans and pork to the list of imports exempted tariffs.\n\nSee: China exempts U.S. agricultural products from tariffs after reports of potential interim trade deal\n\nOn Thursday, the European Central Bank on Thursday cut its deposit rate from -0.4% to -0.5%, while announcing it would restart open-ended purchasing of long-term government bonds at a pace of \u20ac20 billion a month in an effort to further reduce long-term interest rates.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will deliver its monetary policy statement, with further rate cuts widely expected, on Sept. 18.\n\nThus far, stability, if not outright strength, in the economy has been part of the recipe for rising market prices and bond yields, reflecting a pullback in anxieties. Indeed, gains for equities have come as the 2-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD02Y, +3.87% is on track for its sharpest weekly yield rise since 2011 and the 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, +5.97% and the 30-year\u2019s TMUBMUSD30Y, +4.05% sharpest weekly climb in rates since 2016, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nU.S. consumers grew more confident in September, according to the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index, which came in a 92.0 versus the August reading of 89.8.\n\nWhich stocks are in focus?\n\nShares of Broadcom Inc. AVGO, -2.63% were down Friday after the chip maker announced fiscal third-quarter earnings late Thursday that beat analyst expectations, though its outlook for the annual revenue was below what Wall Street expected.\n\nApple AAPL, -2.23% was lower after Goldman Sachs lowered its price target on the grounds that the company\u2019s recently announced TV+ trial period would impact margins. Shares fell Friday.\n\nHow are other markets trading?\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +5.97% extended its weekly gain on Friday, adding 9.5 basis points to 1.881% from 1.789% late Thursday.\n\nIn commodity markets, the price of crude oil CLV19, -0.18% fell 0.5% to $54.81 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while gold prices GCZ19, -0.57% edged 0.2% higher to about $1,510 an ounce. The U.S. dollar DXY, -0.09%, meanwhile, slumped 0.2% lower relative to a basket of leading rivals, extending its weekly of 0.3%.\n\nIn Asia overnight Thursday, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index HSI, +0.98% gained 1% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 NIK, +1.05% rose 1.1%. European shares edged mostly higher Friday, with the Stoxx Europe 600 SXXP, +0.34% closing 0.3% higher.", "description": "U.S. stocks mostly extend an up trend that has put the Dow and S&P 500 close to carving out fresh all-time highs as Sino-American trade tensions ease and...", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Mark Decambre", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GE184_beigeb_ZG_20180222091715.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
