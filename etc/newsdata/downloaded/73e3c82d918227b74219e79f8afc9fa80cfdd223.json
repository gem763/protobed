Unlike existing preparedness assessments, the Global Health Security Index benchmarks health security in the context of other factors critical to fighting outbreaks, such as broad health systems, adherence to global norms, and political and security risks, including public confidence in government.\n\nThe United States does well in five of six preparedness categories, but ranks 19th \u2014 after Australia, Canada, Singapore and more than a dozen European countries \u2014 in measures that assess the overall risk environment and vulnerability to biological threats. The factors driving down the U.S. score include the risks of social unrest and terrorism, and low public confidence in government. Lichtenstein ranked No. 1 on this measure.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome other high-income countries also generally score well. But the report found that a number of middle- and low-income countries scored higher than some wealthy countries. Thailand, for example, is the only non-high-income country to rank in the top tier overall. Its overall rank is sixth highest after the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Australia and Canada.\n\nAnd some very high-income countries, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where experts expected to find better preparedness funding, score below 50 out of a possible highest score of 100. The average overall index score among all 195 countries is 40.2\n\nThe index is a project of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a D.C.-based nonprofit organization, and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. It was developed with guidance from an international panel of experts from 13 countries, with research by the Economist Intelligence Unit. More than 100 researchers spent a year collecting and validating publicly available data.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe project\u2019s organizers hope the rankings will galvanize action, coming amid an ongoing Ebola outbreak in Congo that has killed more than 2,000 people.\n\n\u201cHealth security is a collective responsibility,\u201d said Beth Cameron, vice president for global biological policy and programs at the Nuclear Threat Initiative and one of the index\u2019s leaders. \u201cCountries need to know how prepared they are. And they need to know how prepared their neighbors are. Otherwise we\u2019ll never improve.\u201d\n\nOver the past two decades, decision-makers have focused only sporadically on health security despite concerns after the 2001 anthrax attacks, the emergence of viruses that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, and the looming threat of a pandemic caused by a novel strain of influenza, the report said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSince the 2014 -2016 Ebola epidemic killed more than 11,000 people, many countries \u2014 especially in Africa \u2014 have been more willing to report their level of preparedness, said Cameron, formerly senior director for global health security and biodefense at the National Security Council in the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cBut in terms of financing to fill the gaps, not enough has been done,\u201d she said.\n\nThere needs to be a fundamental shift in understanding that biological catastrophes are a major peace and security risk, Cameron said. While health experts have long recognized those risks, finance ministers, heads of states and other decision-makers have not.\n\nAD\n\nBiological threats are catastrophic, yet responsibility for them is \u201cburied in the bowels of health ministries around the world,\u201d she said.\n\nDuring the first Ebola crisis, the Obama administration created an Ebola czar and established a unit on global health security and biodefense, headed at the senior director level, at the National Security Council. That unit was abolished last year under a reorganization by then-national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nAD\n\nIn the United States, military readiness is staffed at the level of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Biodefense is currently staffed at the level of assistant secretary at the Health and Human Services Department.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen heads of states get together, among their five talking points, this isn\u2019t always one of them,\u201d Cameron said.\n\nAmong the report\u2019s recommendations: the United Nations secretary general should designate a permanent unit for high-consequence biological threats and call a heads-of-state level summit by 2021 on biological threats that includes a focus on financing and emergency response. Responding to biological threats should also be a priority for the next U.S. president, organizers said.\n\nTom Frieden, who was director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the 2014 Ebola epidemic, said the report underscores the lack of significant action since then to close preparedness gaps. It also provides information on aspects of health security that haven\u2019t been previously assessed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe report also highlights an issue that is too often neglected: protecting front-line health workers, said Frieden, who heads Resolve to Save Lives, a New York-based public health nonprofit. His organization has also developed a tool that spotlights gaps in preparedness, and actions that countries and organizations can take to close them.\n\nDozens of health workers have been attacked or killed in Congo\u2019s Ebola outbreak that began in August 2018, the second-deadliest in history, according to World Health Organization officials.\n\nAmong the report\u2019s other findings:\n\nOnly 15 percent of countries score in the highest tier for public confidence in government.\n\nOnly 3 percent show a commitment to prioritizing services for health-care workers who become sick as a result of participating in a public health response.\n\n89 percent of countries do not demonstrate having a system for dispensing medical countermeasures during health emergencies.\n\n92 percent of countries do not show evidence of requiring security checks for personnel with access to dangerous biological materials or toxins.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The United States does well in five of six preparedness categories, but ranks 19th \u2014 after Australia, Canada, Singapore and more than a dozen European countries \u2014 in measures that assess the overall risk environment and vulnerability to biological threats.
