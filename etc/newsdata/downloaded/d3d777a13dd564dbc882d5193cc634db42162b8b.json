In a way, Hanna has given me back my life \u2013 everyone should be speaking to her if they suffer with psoriasis.\u2019\n\nShe says the vegan diet has cured her (Picture: Paula Taylor/Caters News)\n\nThe book Paula used is Radiant: Recipes to heal your skin from within, by Hannah Sillitoe, who also suffered from psoriasis until she started a plant-based diet.\n\nPaula discovered Hanna\u2019s plant-based diet plan online and then bought the book. In under three weeks later, Paula says her painful rashes had disappeared.\n\nPaula said: \u2018I can\u2019t even begin to describe the difference between myself a year ago and now.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not just the physical appearance of my body, which is important, but the mental side is like another world.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m proud of my body again, I feel like a totally new woman and this diet has saved me.\u2019\n\nHanna Sillitoe suffered from psoriasis for 20 years before deciding to try and a find a way to cure her skin condition.\n\nHanna said: \u2018During my worst flare I was offered chemotherapy treatment, cancer drugs.\n\n\u2018When I heard that, I thought there must be a better way to heal myself without going that far.\n\n\u2018I looked online and found other people who had swapped their diet to anti-inflammatory, and a plant-based diet, and their results were amazing.\n\nShe now feels confident for the first time in years (Picture: Paula Taylor/Caters News)\n\n\u2018The diet I recommend is plant based and anti-inflammatory, for the best results I\u2019d advise cutting out meat and dairy entirely, but this can be a gradual process if going fully vegan feels a little overwhelming..\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaula is now spending her time doing everything she had to stop for most of her life \u2013 she wears clothing that shows her body off, sunbathes, exercises, takes beach holidays and feels like a new woman.\n\nPaula said: \u2018If I had never seen this book my life would have continued to be a battle, and would have continued to be so limited.\n\n\u2018After following what Hanna has written and published, I can finally be the woman I always wanted to be.\u2019\n\nWhat is psoriasis? Psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales. These patches normally appear on your elbows, knees, scalp and lower back, but can appear anywhere on your body. Psoriasis affects around 2% of people in the UK and often develops in adults under 35 years old, and affects men and women equally. It is a chronic disease that happens due to an increased production of skin cells. In the standard person, skin cells are made and replaced every three to four weeks, but in psoriasis the process only takes three to seven days. If you think you are suffering from the condition, it is important that you see your GP for a diagnosis. While natural diets may work for some, professional medical advice should be taken before making radical changes to your lifestyle.\n\nMORE: Cat owner saves paralysed kitten thrown out of moving car with \u00a311.99 baby oil\n\nMORE: Cat lover spends thousands and travels miles to keep a rare breed alive\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A woman who started eating a vegan diet says it has cured her severe psoriasis after years of suffering with the skin condition.", "authors": ["Hattie Gladwell"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_91157090_1571742215.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
