And why is this happening, are the people in Ladakh alone responsible for polluting the atmosphere? No, the problem is rooted in the plains. The heat and pollution generated in the plains is heating the atmosphere in the upper regions and with the result the glaciers there are melting rapidly.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe core issue in Ladakh is the environment, for we have a fragile ecological system, climate and topography.\n\n\n\nWhatever and however we develop Ladakh, it will not be at the cost of the environment. That is our primary concern and it is very heartening to see that each and every resident of Ladakh is fully aware of this,\u201d says Namgyal.He goes on to spell out the action he would take in order to achieve a cleaner environment: \u201cGreen practices are not limited to a certain section of people; they are important not only for human beings but for all sentient beings. We all need to contribute to it, because without water and oxygen no one can survive. Everyone wants to lead a happy and healthy life, and you cannot expect to usher these into your life without a green, clean environment. Hence, every citizen has to get involved.\u201dNamgyal informs that Ladakh banned single-use plastic 20 years ago at the initiative of the Women\u2019s Alliance, whose members were not educated but had a high level of awareness. \u201cWhen I was chairman of the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council, we banned the use of firecrackers. They cause noise, soil and air pollution, and frighten birds and animals. Recently, when we got the Union Territory status, we celebrated with great pomp and show but without bursting a single cracker,\u201d he says.What does going green mean to the young and enthused MP? He replies, \u201cTo go green does not mean merely planting more trees. It means to do a lot more to combat climate change, protect the environment and preserve this fragile ecosystem. To go organic means increasing the sustainable livelihood of the people organically, increasing everyone\u2019s earning power, and also ensuring that all sentient beings are taken care of. Now that masters such as Drikung Chetsang Rinpoche, the founder of Go Green Go Organic, have shown us the way, it has become easy for us, the younger generation. We don\u2019t have to look for solutions, we only have to take the project forward and save the world and us.\u201dIsn\u2019t Ladakh being a popular tourist destination also contributing to degrading its natural assets? While admitting that tourism is indeed a thriving sector, and yes, irresponsible tourists could create problems, Namgyal voices concern about the quality rather than volume of footfalls in the region. \u201cWe are working to promote responsible tourism,\u201d he says.And how can we become responsible tourists? \u201cAvoid anti-environment activities, for example. When you come on a road trip, please drive on the road, don\u2019t disturb the wildlife there, don\u2019t drive on the lake or over pastural land where goats, sheep, marmot and many other animals and birds thrive,\u201d he says.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.speakingtree.in/a/749772-1350-420-5/ladakh-takes-the-lead.img", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
