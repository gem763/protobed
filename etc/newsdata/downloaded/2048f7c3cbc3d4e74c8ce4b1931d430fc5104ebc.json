It\u2019s a lot of sand. They\u2019ve got a lot of sand over there. So there\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with.\u201d\n\nThe president commented on the ongoing conflict during a meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella in the Oval Office.\n\nHe acknowledged that the United States would still try to stop the ongoing conflict, just not with military strength.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re watching and we\u2019re negotiating and we\u2019re trying to get Turkey to do the right thing, we want to see wars stopped,\u201d Trump said.\n\nMany Republicans in the foreign policy establishment voiced outrage last week after Trump signaled he would not act to stop Turkey from attacking the Kurds in Syria, arguing the president was betraying the allies of the United States fight to defeat ISIS.\n\nBut Trump indicated the Kurds had their own problems, but had the ability to defend themselves.\n\n\u201cThey know how to fight. They are not angels,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get Turkey to do the right thing. We want to see wars stopped.\u201d\n\nThe president expressed confidence the Kurds would survive the Turkish offensive in Syria, noting their recent deal with Bashar al-Assad for protection.\n\n\u201cSyria\u2019s protecting the Kurds. They\u2019re safe,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also defended his own handling of the conflict, despite bipartisan criticism.\n\n\u201cI view the situation on the Turkish border with Syria for the United States \u2014 strategically brilliant,\u201d he said.", "description": "President Donald Trump distanced himself and the United States from the conflict between Syria and Turkey in the Middle East on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Charlie Spiering"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/U.s.-President-donald-Trump-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
