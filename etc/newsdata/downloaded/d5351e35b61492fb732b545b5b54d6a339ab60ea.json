It\u2019s not a game, that\u2019s a big boy in there. Sheesh. I\u2019m pretty much on bed rest at this point.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t walk that well. My ankles got a little swollen; my feet got a little swollen. But for the most part, I\u2019m all belly. He\u2019s coming soon, can\u2019t wait.\u2019\n\nWell, it doesn\u2019t look like Baby Edwards is in any rush.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
