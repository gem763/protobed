The pup was initially called Oliver, but was renamed in Ovechkin\u2019s honor. He lives with a volunteer puppy-raiser, Sandidge said, who will take care of him, help him get used to living in a regular household and teach him the fundamental skills of being a service animal.\n\nAD\n\nWhen Captain leaves Washington, he\u2019ll head back to America\u2019s VetDogs headquarters for some additional training and will then be paired with a District-area veteran or first responder. (In other words, don\u2019t worry; he\u2019ll be a lifelong Caps fan.)\n\nSo what\u2019s he like? Well, he\u2019s really cute. Take a look at some more photos.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s this floppy, soft, cuddly dog,\u201d Sandidge said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been afraid of anything so far. On the red carpet today with all the cameras, he didn\u2019t flinch. He was around loud noises. Nothing fazes him. He was at the rink this past week, and even with the pucks hitting the glass, the sticks tapping, he just wags his tail and looks around.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCapitals players are still getting to know Captain since the team was on the road at the beginning of the week to start the season. But the few players who have met their new pooch are already smitten, Sandidge said. The dog spent some time hanging around the locker room before puck drop against the Hurricanes on Saturday night, and the team plans to make sure players get some time with him during the week after practices.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve only had him for the week, but you can already see him responding to his name,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you tell him to sit, he\u2019ll sit immediately. If you hold your hand down to touch, he\u2019ll touch his nose to your hand. Even when you take him off the leash, he\u2019ll just sit there. He won\u2019t try to run away. He\u2019ll just sniff around.\u201d\n\nCaptain, who is already on Twitter and Instagram, will also be making public appearances, in case any fans want to get their fix of cute puppy photos.\n\nRead more from D.C.
