They\u2019ve swelled to more than $1,000 on StubHub for a single standing-room-only ticket. (And that\u2019s before a couple hundred more in fees.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been watching ticket prices like a hawk,\u201d the 31-year-old baby shark said.\n\nAD\n\nHis heart says: GO! His conscience (and wife) says: NO!\n\n\u201cWhen you have a joint checking account,\u201d the father of two said, \u201cyou have other things to worry about than Nationals tickets. But it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m happy for them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOr so he says. Other hardcore Nats fans \u2014 the armchair \u00adscorekeepers, the get-there-for-batting-practice crowd, the pleaders for toss-up balls \u2014 have been simultaneously fuming and metaphorically scrounging for spare change in the couch.\n\n\u201cIs there another website/forum for buying tickets outside of criminal fees?\u201d one Nats fan asked this week in the team\u2019s forum on Reddit.\n\nDiscussion there grew heated as the ticketless, looking for scapegoats to feed a legion of baby sharks, accused season ticket holders of flipping seats for big profits on the secondary market. Scores of nasty posts were deleted, and the subreddit\u2019s moderators issued a stern warning.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBecause the issue has already been discussed at length,\u201d they wrote, \u201cand basic economics cannot be expected to change, further posts debating the nature and ethics of ticket allocation and the secondary market, what [season ticket holders] or others choose to do or not to do with their tickets, and harassing or inflammatory posts will not be allowed.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPerhaps some forgiveness is in order, though.\n\nThe World Series is a very stressful time for serious baseball fans, particularly among those who a) can\u2019t afford seats and b) understand the heartbreaking nature of the game, which has left some teams World Series-less for many pain-filled years.\n\nThat stress has been gnawing at Kyle Dolan, who grew up in Annandale, Va., and now works in the music industry in New York. He has given up hope on getting tickets at a price he\u2019s able and willing to pay \u2014 around $600, including fees \u2014 and that reality is tormenting him.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt makes you wonder, like, I may legitimately never get to see the Nationals play a World Series game again on their home field,\u201d he said. \u201cThis could be it.\u201d\n\nKucinich is somewhat sanguine about the ticket issue. This Nats run has already given him incredible memories, such as the photo of him, in full shark costume, meeting baby shark godfather Gerardo Parra.\n\nAD\n\nAsked if he was worried that fat-cat corporate types just there for \u201cthe experience\u201d would fill the stands rather than die-harders like himself, Kucinich demurred.\n\n\u201cAll of this is great for the team,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more people are involved, the more people are willing to open their wallets for this team \u2014 that\u2019s great for everyone.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat includes off the field.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just great for this town to be rallied around one thing,\u201d the baby shark said. \u201cI mean, we just had members of Congress storm into a meeting. Things are really contentious right now. But you could probably get all of those people together at a Nats game to have a good time and high five.\u201d\n\nHmmm.\n\nAnyway, even though Kucinich said he\u2019s content to watch the game with his family, he is also pursuing other options.\n\nHe\u2019s trying to get the shark costume company to use him as a walking advertisement at the games. He has emailed the Nats and 106.7 for tickets \u2014 no-go, so far. He\u2019s planning to wear his shark costume all day at work Friday to see what opportunities might develop.\n\nAnd he more or less begged this reporter to include his Twitter handle (@NatsSharkGuy) and email address (NatsSharkGuy@gmail.com) in this story.\n\n\u201cPlease send along any requests for the shark,\u201d he said, adding a somewhat murky promise: \u201cIf the Nats sweep, you\u2019re going to see a shark swimming in the Anacostia River.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Matt Kucinich is torn.
