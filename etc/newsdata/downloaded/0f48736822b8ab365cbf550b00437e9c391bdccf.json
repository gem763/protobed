That\u2019s hardly cause for celebration - 100 is the top score.\n\nDiets are still too heavy on foods that can contribute to heart disease, diabetes, obesity and other prevalent U.S. health problems, said co-author Fang Fang Zhang, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University near Boston.\n\nThe study was published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The results are from an analysis of U.S. government health surveys from 1999 to 2016 involving nearly 44,000 adults.\n\n\u201cDespite observed improvements,\u201d the authors wrote, \u201cimportant dietary challenges\u201d remain.\n\nAmong them: Getting Americans to cut down on snack foods, hot dogs, fatty beef, butter and other foods containing saturated fats. The study found these unhealthy fats increased from 11.5% to almost 12% of daily calories, above the recommended 10% limit.\n\nAnd while the biggest change was a small drop in added sugars, from about 16% to roughly 14%, that\u2019s still too high. The government says less than 10% of daily calories should come from added sugars. Researchers think fewer sweetened sodas contributed to the decline, but Zhang noted added sugars are often found in foods that don\u2019t even seem sweet, including some yogurts and tomato sauce.\n\nFruits, nuts, oatmeal and other whole grains are among the types of foods adults ate slightly more of. Still, each of those contributed to less than 5% of daily calories in 2016, the study found.\n\nSalt intake dipped slightly and a small decline in fruit juice contributed to a drop in low-quality carbs. But these still amount to 42% of daily calories, including many likely from highly processed white bread and other refined grains, Zhang said.\n\nThe study is based on in-person health surveys conducted every two years that ask adults to recall what foods they ate in the previous 24 hours. Starting in 2003, adults were asked that question twice several days apart.\n\nThe study lists food groups rather than individual foods; for example \u201cwhole grains,\u201d not oatmeal, and \u201crefined grains,\u201d not white bread but Zhang said those two foods are among the most common grains in the U.S. diet.\n\nU.S. dietary guidelines recommend a \u201chealthy eating pattern\u201d to reduce chances of developing chronic disease. The focus should be on nutrient-dense foods including vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products; plus varied proteins sources including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs nuts and seeds, the recommendations say.\n\nDuring the study years, U.S. diabetes rates almost doubled, to more than 7%; obesity rates increased during many of those years, with about 70% of U.S. adults now overweight or obese. Heart disease remains the leading cause of death.\n\nBesides continued public health efforts, \u201cCooperation from the food industry\u201d is key, a journal editorial said, including by reducing sugar, salt and saturated fats in foods.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner at @LindseyTanner.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
