They had already spent much of the money and had an overdraft of about $107,000, WNEP-TV reported.\n\nAmong their purchases, according to state police, per WNEP-TV: a down payment for a Chevrolet SUV, two four-wheelers, a camper and a car trailer. They allegedly paid bills, made cash purchases and gave $15,000 to friends in need.\n\nThe bank contacted Tiffany Williams, who said they didn't have the money anymore but she would talk with her husband to figure out how they might repay, according to the Sun-Gazette.\n\nIn July, state police were contacted when the couple stopped communicating with the bank, the newspaper reported. The couple allegedly told investigators they knew the money wasn't theirs but still spent it.\n\nThe couple were arraigned Tuesday on felony theft charges and released on $25,000 bail. A man who said he was Robert Williams' father told WNEP-TV, \"I have no idea what's going on, I don't know what to tell you.\"\n\nState police did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment Monday.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Ryan Miller on Twitter @RyanW_Miller\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Pennsylvania couple arrested: Bank wrongly deposited $120K they spent", "description": "The couple from Montoursville, Pennsylvania, allegedly purchased a car, paid their bills and handed the money out to friends, police said.", "authors": ["Ryan W.
