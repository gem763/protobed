His stark warning came as Booker and his team were set to gather Saturday in rainy Des Moines Iowa for the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry, an event designed to showcase the organizational mettle of the remaining presidential campaigns.\n\n\"We need to maximize support from our current donor base, and we need to seal the deal with supporters who like Cory but have been waiting to contribute because of an assumption that they can wait until later,\" he wrote.\n\nSenator Cory Booker speaks at an LGBTQ presidential forum on September 20, 2019, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Getty\n\nCampaigns frequently send out end-of-quarter fundraising emails to hit their quarterly goals, but Demissie acknowledged that this end of quarter fundraising push is different.\n\n\"I want to be clear: This isn't an end-of-quarter stunt or another one of those memos from a campaign trying to spin the press,\" he wrote. \"This is a real, unvarnished look under the hood of our operation at a level of transparency unprecedented in modern presidential campaigns.\"\n\nBooker weighed in Saturday morning, saying, \"It's an unusual move for a campaign like ours to be this transparent, but there can be no courage without vulnerability. I want people to see where we are and understand that we have a pathway to victory, but I can't walk it alone.\"\n\nBooker's campaign has invested early in ground game organizations in both Iowa and New Hampshire and said Friday night at an LGBTQ presidential forum in Iowa that the campaign's strategy from day one is to \"win Iowa.\"", "description": "\"The next 10 days will determine whether Cory Booker can stay in this race and compete to win the nomination,\" Addisu Demissie, Booker's presidential campaign manager, wrote in a memo", "authors": ["Jack Turman"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/21/6cc28c4a-98e1-476a-825f-a1346b2c24e0/thumbnail/1200x630/867d19069c9975bc288b1f934b791a1c/gettyimages-1176038317.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
