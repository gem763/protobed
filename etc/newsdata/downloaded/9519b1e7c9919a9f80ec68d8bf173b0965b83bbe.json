Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, said al-Baghdadi\u2019s remains were buried at sea within 24 hours of his death inside an underground tunnel where he fled as special operations soldiers closed in on him.\n\nThe Pentagon released the first government photos and video clips of the nighttime operation, including one showing Delta Force commandos approaching the walls of the compound in which al-Baghdadi and others were found.\n\n\"...at the compound, fighters from two locations in the vicinity of the compound began firing on U.S. aircraft participating in the assault.\"\n\n- Gen Frank McKenzie CDR USCENTCOM pic.twitter.com/SkrtHNDs7w \u2014 U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM) October 30, 2019\n\nAnother video showed American airstrikes on other militants who fired at helicopters carrying soldiers to the compound. The U.S. also bombed the compound after the soldiers completed the mission so that it would not stand as a shrine to al-Baghdadi.\n\n\u201cIt looks pretty much like a parking lot with large potholes right now,\u201d McKenzie said.\n\nThe attacking American force launched from an undisclosed location inside Syria for the one-hour helicopter ride to the compound, McKenzie said.\n\nTwo children died with al-Baghdadi when he detonated a bomb vest, McKenzie said, adding that this was one fewer than originally reported. He said the children appeared to be under the age of 12. Eleven other children were escorted from the site unharmed. Four women and two men who were wearing suicide vests and refused to surrender inside the compound were killed, McKenzie said.\n\nThe general said the military dog that was injured during the raid is a four-year veteran with U.S. Special Operations Command and had been on approximately 50 combat missions.\n\nThe dog, a male whose name has not been released because the mission was classified, was injured when he came in contact with exposed live electrical cables in the tunnel after al-Baghdadi detonated his vest, McKenzie said. He said the dog has returned to duty.\n\nBaghdadi was identified by comparing his DNA to a sample collected in 2004 by U.S. forces in Iraq, where he had been detained.\n\nThe U.S. managed to collect \u201csubstantial\u201d amounts of documentation and electronics during the rain, McKenzie said, but he would not elaborate. Such efforts are a standard feature of raids against high-level extremist targets and can be useful in learning more about the group\u2019s plans.\n\nAlthough the raid was successful, McKenzie said it would be a mistake to conclude that the Islamic State has been defeated.\n\n\u201cIt will take them some time to re-establish someone to lead the organization, and during that period of time their actions may be a little bit disjointed,\u201d the general said. \u201cThey will be dangerous. We suspect they will try some form of retribution attack, and we are postured and prepared for that.\u201d\n\nIn outlining the operation, McKenzie said al-Baghdadi had been at the compound in Syria\u2019s northwest Idlib province for \u201ca considerable period,\u201d but he was not specific.\n\nHe said the raid was briefed to President Donald Trump on Friday, and McKenzie made the decision to go ahead on Saturday morning.\n\nMcKenzie offered no new details about al-Baghdadi\u2019s final moments.\n\n\u201cHe crawled into a hole with two small children and blew himself up while his people stayed on the grounds,\u201d he said when asked by a reporter about al-Baghdadi\u2019s last moments and Trump\u2019s description of the Islamic State leader as \u201cwhimpering and crying and screaming all the way\u201d to his death.\n\nOther senior Pentagon officials, including Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have said they could not confirm Trump\u2019s description.\n\nSeveral times this month, President Donald Trump has said he is withdrawing from Syria and that the troops are \u201ccoming home.\u201d But, in fact, the U.S. military remains in the country, shifting positions and gearing up to execute Trump\u2019s order to secure Syria\u2019s oil fields \u2014 not for the Syrian government but for the Kurds. Trump also has said he wants to \u201ckeep\u201d the oil, although it\u2019s unclear what he means.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the acting homeland security secretary, Kevin McAleenan, told a congressional hearing that U.S. security agencies have been reminded of the potential for al-Baghdadi\u2019s death to inspire his followers to launch an attack \u201cin the immediate aftermath.\u201d\n\nRussell Travers, the acting director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told the same hearing that he does not believe al-Baghdadi\u2019s death will have \u201cmuch impact\u201d on the organization.\n\n\u201cIf there were significant attacks that were in the planning, that planning will continue. It won\u2019t have that much effect,\u201d Travers aid.\n\nWithin Syria and Iraq, he added, IS has at least 14,000 fighters.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an important number,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause five, six years ago, when ISIS was at its low point, they were down under a thousand. To us, this tells us the insurgency has a lot of options.\u201d\n\nFBI Director Chris Wray said the biggest concern in the United States was the \u201cvirtual caliphate\u201d that inspires Americans to pledge allegiance to IS and commit acts of violence in the group\u2019s name even without traveling to Syria.\n\nRep. Bennie G. Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said he worries that despite al-Baghdadi\u2019s death, the conditions in Syria \u201care ripe for ISIS to reconstitute.\u201d", "description": "The general who oversaw the U.S. raid on Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi provided the most detailed account yet of the operation Wednesday and said...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU068_al_bag_ZG_20191027102840.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
