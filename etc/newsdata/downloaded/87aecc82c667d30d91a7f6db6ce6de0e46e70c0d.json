Hawkins, Indiana,\u2019 accompanied by the tweet: \u2018Anyway I think you\u2019ll \u2013 sorry I couldn\u2019t get it done \u2013 but you mean so \u2013 and it\u2019s been \u2013 hope this is \u2013 last until \u2013 love,\u2019 \u2013 a sentence which has purposely left words out.\n\nIt came after fans claimed to have clocked Hopper\u2019s car on the set of the show\u2019s upcoming season, leading to more speculation the character is alive.\n\nStranger Things seasons one to three are available to watch on Netflix now.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
