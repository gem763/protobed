We had just landed at Los Angeles International Airport and were taxiing to the gate when a woman started to yell about wanting to get off the plane. Now.\n\nExpletives were hurled through the air of the low-cost carrier cabin as the woman insisted other passengers get out of her way. We reached the gate and the altercation reached its fever pitch. The woman barged into the aisle and demanded the man in front of her move immediately. \u201cI have a broken leg!\u201d the man wailed back in defense. The woman clamored through nonetheless and barreled her way to the exit.\n\nThat is not how you get off a plane.\n\nDeplaning is a facet of travel that can get people very riled up. Once a plane gets to the gate and the fasten seat belt sign is turned off, there are a few ways travelers can play their cards.\n\nOne option is to pop up immediately. That ding! elicits a Pavlovian response to make a run for it. The other is to linger in your seat a little longer, knowing it\u2019s going to take a while before you can go anywhere. What\u2019s the rush?\n\nTo find out once and for all the proper way to get off an airplane, we talked to experts about the etiquette of deplaning. Here\u2019s what they had to say.\n\nStep 1: Pack light, and gather your things before the plane lands\n\nGood deplaning etiquette starts in the air. Once the plane has begun its descent, that\u2019s your cue to get your belongings together.\n\n\u201cWhen the flight attendants make that announcement that it\u2019s time to put away your electronics, that is a great time to start packing your bag,\u201d says Abbie Unger, a former flight attendant who owns a company helping aspiring flight attendants.\n\nCheck the seat-back pocket, wind up your headphones, assemble your trash and make sure you have all of your valuables (laptops get left behind more than you\u2019d think).\n\n\u201cMake sure that you are ready to go. This will also will help you not forget anything, because when the fasten seat belt sign goes off and all your neighbors stand up and you get pressured, you\u2019ll forget to look,\u201d Unger says.\n\nAnd whether you\u2019re jumping up at the ding or laying low, when it\u2019s your turn to get out into the aisle and deplane, you don\u2019t want to be that passenger holding up the aisle because you have too much stuff to juggle. You want to be able to get your things from the overhead compartment quickly and walk to the exit quickly. That\u2019s made easier when you\u2019re following carry-on rules.\n\nStep 2: Stay seated until the fasten seat belt sign goes off\n\nWe get it. You want to get out of this cramped tube and back into the world. But if you stand up while the plane is still rolling to your gate, the plane could actually stop and slow down your deplaning even more.\n\n\u201cIt is a safety issue,\u201d says Jennifer \u201cJaki\u201d Johnson, a flight attendant for a major carrier as well as the CEO and founder of Jetsetter Chic. \u201cWe have to call the pilot to say a passenger is standing up. FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] will not allow us to move on the jetway if that happens. We will have to wait for you to sit down. It\u2019s very important for the safety of everyone else, and for people with short connection times, that people sit down and just wait till the plane is parked at the gate.\"\n\n[The completely correct guide to reclining on an airplane]\n\nStep 3: Be mindful of connecting flights, for yourself and others\n\nIf you think you\u2019re going to miss your connecting flight, don\u2019t wait until it\u2019s time to get off the plane to freak out about it. Let flight attendants know about your anxiety-inducing connection as soon as possible so that they can watch for updates about your next flight, switch your seat to somewhere closer to the front of the plane or help you deplane faster.\n\nFor people without pressing connections, pay attention to flight attendant announcements about connections anyway. They may ask that passengers allow those with tight connections to pass first. While those travelers may have a chance of getting rebooked on something immediately, they could be in trouble if their next flight is international, as some are only scheduled once a day. Rack up some karma points and let them through.\n\nStep 4: Watch for your turn to enter the aisle to leave\n\nYou hear the ding. You want to flee the aircraft. That\u2019s understandable.\n\n\u201cWhen the seat belt sign turns off everybody tries to stand up \u2060 \u2014 which I get because you\u2019ve been sitting for a long time. Sometimes you\u2019re almost too tall for the seat. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big of a deal to stand up in your own space,\u201d Unger says. \u201cBut then the next thing that you want to do is start paying attention to what\u2019s going on around you so that you are seeing when your row is coming up.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s fine to stand, wait to move into the aisle and to grab your things until it\u2019s your row\u2019s turn. Your turn can vary in certain situations, but most of the time it\u2019s when the rows in front of you have already exited. \u201cDon\u2019t try to get into the aisle before it\u2019s your turn in case the person in the row in front has their bag a few rows behind them,\u201d Unger says.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re that person with bags stored in overhead bins of rows behind you, don\u2019t enter the aisle and go against traffic to retrieve them. Pop out when you see the aisle is clear so that you don\u2019t clog the walkway. It\u2019s also good form to let others go ahead of you if you have a lot of things to collect.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m traveling with my children we don\u2019t get off when it\u2019s our row\u2019s turn because you have, like, 35 teddy bears to carry,\" says Unger. \"We\u2019re not going to try to get in the aisle in front of the businessmen who are zipping off.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re ready when your turn comes, you can go. If you\u2019re not ready, then that\u2019s really not your turn,\u201d Unger continues. \u201cYou need to wait until you\u2019re ready and then you go.\u201d\n\nStep 5: Be a considerate human on your way out\n\nUnless you\u2019re in full panic mode trying to pull a Hail Mary flight connection, slow down enough to ensure you\u2019re a respectful member of society as you deplane. If you can, help your neighbors out.\n\nAs you leave, don\u2019t forget to thank your flight crew. Many of their interactions with travelers can be negative, so a smile or a thank you goes a long way. While they\u2019re posted up by the doors thanking you on your way out, take out your headphones and respond.\n\nFew people want to be on a plane longer than they need to be. There\u2019s a reason why boarding takes an eternity, and deplaning goes by in half the time. We all have meetings to rush off to, loved ones to see or other flights to catch, so try to deplane with grace and efficiency to make the process a little nicer for everyone.\n\nRead more Travel:\n\nThe do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of in-flight grooming\n\nHow to get paid to travel\n\nFollow By The Way on Instagram for city highlights, travel tips and more\n\nHow to survive 12 hours in an airport\n\nDiscover something new:\n\nWe\u2019ve curated these stories to inspire your curiosity.\n\nUnderstanding the human cost of your smartphone\n\nThe world has grown reliant on lithium-ion batteries, but the desperate search for the ingredients carries a steep cost.\n\nThe debate over how to provide affordable urban housing\n\nD.C. housed the homeless in upscale apartments.
