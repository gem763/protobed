It\u2019s actually a serious idea. And Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang has dangled it like candy before voters.\n\nYang is a fan of \u201cuniversal basic income,\u201d which is a lump sum transferred by the government to every adult citizen, every month, with no strings attached. The idea is that people looking out for themselves will spend the money better than giant safety-net programs might allocate it, providing a buffer against poverty, job dislocation and people losing out in a tech-driven knowledge economy.\n\nIn theory, universal basic income would address worsening income inequality and provide money underprivileged people could use for education, investment or anything else they feel would help them get ahead. Working parents would have help paying for child care or taking time off to care for a newborn or sick child. UBI could help cover surprise medical bills or a furnace that conks out and needs to be replaced.\n\nYang calls his version of UBI the \u201cfreedom dividend,\u201d and would set the payout at $1,000 a month for every American 18 and over, or $12,000 per year, no matter how rich or poor. People currently receiving some kind of welfare payment wouldn\u2019t get both\u2014they\u2019d have to choose between their current benefits or the $12,000 annual payout.\n\nSome voters love the idea. After Yang announced a UBI contest during the Sept. 12 Democratic debate, nearly half a million people signed up for the chance to be one of 10 winners receiving the Yang handout for a year. It\u2019s gimmicky, but as the centerpiece of Yang\u2019s presidential campaign, UBI has kept him on the debate stage and made him more popular than members of Congress and other presidential candidates becoming also-rans.\n\nNot surprisingly, however, there are some major problems with Yang\u2019s UBI. Here are four:\n\nIt\u2019s enormously expensive\n\nA $12,000 annual stipend for all 256 million adult Americans would run about $3 trillion per year. The government currently spends about $4.5 trillion per year, so Yang\u2019s UBI would represent a 67% increase in federal outlays. There would be some offsets. Since current welfare recipients wouldn\u2019t be allowed to double-dip, there\u2019d be a decline in the $500 billion in annual welfare spending. But the increase in federal spending would still be epic, requiring...\n\nSharp tax hikes.\n\nYang wants to impose a 10% value-added tax, which would be like a federal sales tax. VATs are in effect in 168 countries and they\u2019re proven revenue-generators. \u201cA gradually phased-in VAT could have the potential to let us have our cake and eat it too, in terms of raising long-term revenue,\u201d says William Gale of the Tax Policy Center.\n\nIt would still be a giant tax on consumers subject to vilification by opponents likely to claim it would make baby formula and smartphones unaffordable. And a VAT wouldn\u2019t be enough. Yang would also impose a carbon tax that would push up gas and home-heating prices and a financial transaction tax, while raising the capital gains tax rate and the payroll tax for higher earners. That\u2019s a lot of tax hikes. In a rational nation with a rational government, it might be possible to reengineer the tax code so thoroughly and improve the overall economy. In America, today, it\u2019s an understatement to say this is doubtful.\n\nDemocratic Presidential candidate Andrew Yang takes pictures with a supporter after speaking during the AFL-CIO Workers Presidential Summit in Philadelphia, U.S., September 17, 2019. REUTERS/Mark Makela More\n\nThe abuses\n\nMost people might spend their UBI responsibly, but there are bound to be some who head straight to the liquor store or the casino with each month\u2019s check\u2014and they\u2019ll get an outsized share of media attention. A bigger problem could be abusive businesses that target recipients\u2019 checks in who-knows-what novel ways, just as some used-car dealers offer \u201cspecial deals\u201d right around the time people get their income-tax refunds every spring. \u201cIt\u2019s putting a big red X on every consumer\u2019s back,\u201d Gale says. \u201cThe unintended effects are always there.\u201d", "description": "It would require sharp tax hikes and rankle voters opposed to government handouts.", "authors": ["Rick Newman", "Senior Columnist"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NPs59PedkX_22G75YrZtsQ--~B/aD0yMzMzO3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/a90afa10-df99-11e9-a7ae-c6e1cc1275f6", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
