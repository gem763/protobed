After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion,\u2019 she added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except ONE account. (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.)\u2019\n\nColeen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy (top) in 2016 (Picture: PA)\n\nColeen continued: \u2018Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from.\n\n\u2018I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u2019\n\nColleen Rooney accused Rebekah Vardy of selling stories to the press (Picture: Instagram)\n\nColeen captioned the statement: \u2018This has been a burden in my life for a few years now and finally I have got to the bottom of it\u2026\u2026\u2019\n\nBut despite the mother-of-four\u2019s accusations, her fellow WAG has insisted she is innocent and is now getting a team of lawyers to conduct an investigation to see who has access to her Instagram account.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn response to the claims, Rebekah said she was \u2018so upset\u2019 over the scandal and was struggling to deal with the stress of it all while pregnant.\n\nThe star added: \u2018I\u2019m disgusted that I\u2019m even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\u2019\n\nA spokesman for Coleen later insisted: \u2018It is irrefutable that the leaks came from one account, and one account only.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
