There are dozens of thank yous I need to make. So bear with me over the next week as I gush over the amazing group of people who gave us this beautiful moment,\u201d she captioned a black and white photo of her and \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d star embracing. \u201cBut before we do any of that, Jeff and I just want to put it out there that WE GOT MARRIED! For real.\u201d\n\n'THE WALKING DEAD' STAR JEFFREY DEAN MORGAN REACTS TO BEN AFFLECK'S APOLOGY TO HIS WIFE\n\nShe continued: \u201cWe\u2019ve lived as husband and wife for a decade. We\u2019ve built a family, and a farm and found our community. For years, publications have reported that we got married in 2014 or 2015 and that I\u2019ve been married and divorced before. All untrue.\u201d\n\nAccording to Us Weekly, the former \u201cOne Tree Hill\u201d star, 37, met Morgan, 53, in 2009 when they were introduced by his \u201cSupernatural\u201d co-star Jensen Ackles. Together they share son Agustus, 9, and daughter George, 19 months.\n\n\u201cWE knew our truth. So it felt silly to try and correct anything. Here\u2019s the God\u2019s honest fact: From the moment I met @jeffreydeanmorgan , he was my husband. Rather than make vows right out of the gate, we lived them. For over ten years. The good times and the bad,\u201d Burton wrote in her post. \u201cStanding up there with our children at our sides - celebrating all that has been - was bliss. I love you Jeffrey. I love our intimate group of friends and family who joined us. I love the various circles of loved ones who have supported us over the years.\u201d\n\nJEFFREY DEAN MORGAN ADMITS HE'S NEVER SEEN WIFE HILARIE BURTON'S SHOW 'ONE TREE HILL'\n\nShe concluded: \u201cIt was private and magical and everything I dreamed. So yeah. I\u2019m Mrs. Morgan. 10.5.19.\u201d\n\nMorgan took to Instagram as well to reveal that the ceremony was performed by Ackles as well as his \"Walking Dead\" co-star, Norman Reedus.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Ok. A few words... It was an intimate ceremony... performed by @jensenackles and @bigbaldhead with our kids at our sides... and the party of the century afterwards,\" he wrote. \"Thank you to all our friends and family. It was, without a doubt... the best day of our lives. Ever ever. Just never knew that it could be so damn perfect. It was.
