We feel it's possible for the plant to increase its productivity and become profitable.\"\n\nLatest in string of government loans\n\nIn a written statement issued Monday explaining the decision to temporarily close the Thurso plant, Fortress CEO Giovanni Iadeluca said the company is allocating resources to allow it to restart operations once there's a significant rebound in the price of dissolving pulp, which is used in the textile industry.\n\nTuesday's $8-million loan is in addition to a $5-million loan the Quebec government issued to the company in early September to keep the mill operating.\n\nThe Thurso plant and its workers have weathered several closures in recent years, including the mothballing of the plant in 2009 as a pulp and paper mill by its previous owner, Fraser Papers.\n\n'Ready to lend a hand'\n\nWhen Fortress purchased the facility in 2010 it secured a $102-million loan from the Quebec government to convert the mill to manufacture dissolving pulp, and to build a 24-megawatt co-generation plant.\n\nHowever the $175-million project ended up costing $300-million, and in May 2019 the Quebec government agreed to give Fortress until 2022 to start paying back the loan.\n\nMathieu Lacombe, MNA for Papineau and the minister responsible for the Outaouais, was also present during Tuesday's news conference.\n\n\"It's essential to support workers and their families,\" said Lacombe in French. \"These are people we rub shoulders with every day. It's important to find the means to get the situation back on track, and we're ready to lend a hand.\"", "description": "The Quebec government is lending the owner\u00a0of the pulp mill in Thurso\u00a0up to $8 million\u00a0in an attempt to restart the shuttered plant, which employs more than 300.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5312997.1570543630!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fortress-mill-thurso.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
