Trump cited the possibility that \u201cbad people\u201d from the UK\u2019s island nation would infiltrate into the US while posing as refugees from the Hurricane Dorian devastation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, you think drug dealers sneaked into the Bahamas and hid out there in the middle of a hurricane,\u201d Meyers said, noting that the only people who wound up in the Bahamas who didn\u2019t belong there were \u201cpeople who got on the wrong cruise.\u201d Meyers noted that Trump \u201chas always conflated immigrants with criminals.\u201d\n\nBolton\u2019s firing/resignation (depending on who is telling the tale) was also in the Meyers crosshairs. Meyers was particularly bothered by Trump characterizing Bolton as a \u201ctough guy\u201d on Iraq, noting Bolton was well-known as a warhawk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like firing someone for embezzlement when they had embezzlement under \u201cSkills\u201d on their resume,\u201d Meyers chortled.\n\nWatch the complete segment above.\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
