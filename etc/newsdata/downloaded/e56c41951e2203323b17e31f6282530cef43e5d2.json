They are deployed disproportionately against people of colour and people experiencing mental health issues, and have alarmingly been used against children under 11.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Its use is regulated by strict standards and is conditional on the completion of a rigorous training programme. Forces across the country are already increasing the number of Taser-trained officers.\n\n\u201cDecisions on the deployment of Taser are part of the operational responsibilities of chief constables and their decisions are based on the assessment of the particular threat, risk and harm within their force area.\u201d\n\nSupport for the weapons among police chiefs varies, with some fearing that their increased use damages public relations and undermines the unarmed nature of British policing.\n\n\u201cIt is a very powerful bit of kit, it\u2019s also potentially very dangerous,\u201d Dame Cressida Dick said last week.\n\nThe proportion of officers that would take up the offer of a Taser is unclear. Police are routinely given handcuffs, batons, body armour and CS spray.\n\nA recent Police Federation survey found 94 per cent of respondents wanted Tasers issued to more frontline officers, but 20 per cent of Metropolitan Police officers in an internal questionnaire said they would not want one.\n\nTasers were originally introduced as a \u201cless lethal weapon\u201d for firearms officers in 2003, but police leaders acknowledge that the remit has widened.\n\nCampaigners have argued against their use on people suffering mental health crises, and the weapons have been linked to several deaths.\n\nPolice recorded mental health as a factor in 14 per cent of Taser incidents.\n\nInstances of Taser use rose by 50 per cent in 2017-18, with the main reasons being protection or detaining a suspect.\n\nThe vast majority of the 17,000 times where Tasers were drawn or used resulted in arrests \u2013 but 950 people were hospitalised and 750 were detained under the Mental Health Act.\n\nTasers were not actually fired in 85 per cent of the incidents.\n\nSophie Khan, a solicitor who represents victims of Taser-related injuries, told The Independent the weapons could kill suspects.\n\n\u201cThere have been really serious incidents with Tasers being used on people suffering a mental health crisis,\u201d she added. \u201cThe bar has been lowered.\u201d\n\nThere are questions over what effect Tasers have on suspects\u2019 behaviour, following a study that found officers visibly carrying them were more likely to be attacked because they \u201cstimulate aggression\u201d.\n\nKaty Bourne OBE, chair of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC), said Taser use must be \u201cproportionate, lawful and accountable\u201d.\n\nMartyn Underhill, the APCC\u2019s lead for use of force, said: \u201cWe have a long-established principle of policing by consent in this country, so it is important that the public continues to be consulted on any changes to police deployment of this nature.\n\n\u201cWe also want to work with our policing partners to ensure that there is a robust evidence base around increased use of Taser and the corresponding impact on the number of assaults on police officers.\u201d", "description": "More than 10,000 extra police officers across the country are to be armed with Tasers.\u00a0 The Home Office said it was making \u00a310m available to increase the number of trained and equipped officers following violent attacks where officers have been hit by cars and stabbed. But ministers were accused of risking an \u201cescalation of violence\u201d by funding more stun guns for bobbies on", "authors": ["Lizzie Dearden"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/01/14/21/pa-32319604web.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
