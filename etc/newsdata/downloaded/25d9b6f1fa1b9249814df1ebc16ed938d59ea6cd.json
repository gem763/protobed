Will he and Aaron stay together \u2013 or will Robert encourage Aaron to walk away and live his life, particularly is it\u2019s a desperately long jail time?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert\u2019s exit forms part of a huge week for the soap which also sees Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley) take a violent revenge on Nate Robinson (Jurell Carter) for his affair with Moira (Natalie J Robb). As a deadly fight to the death breaks out, Moira ends up plunging into the lake while the boat which is the arena for the scrap explodes.\n\nElsewhere, back in the village, Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter) will go into labour while trapped in the toilets with Marlon (Mark Charnock). Will Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt) make it to the arrival of his child on time?\n\nProducer Kate Brooks recently confirmed that Robert\u2019s exit would see Aaron return to some of his old ways, indicating that there will be times of high drama ahead for the character as he faces up to the loss of his soulmate.\n\nShe teased: \u2018Robert leaving is going to hit him hard. He is the love of Aaron\u2019s life whom he adored, and has kept Aaron anchored and on the straight and narrow. So when the rug is pulled from underneath his feet, it really affects Aaron and it makes him behave in ways that he wouldn\u2019t normally.\n\n\u2018I think we\u2019re going to see the Aaron of old, before Robert came along and straightened him out. We have loads of great stuff for Danny and Isobel, as they try to navigate their world without Robert in it.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Aaron is left devastated.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EXTRA_24_10_EMM_ROBERT_COURT_1ST_EP_02-3b48-e1571395042599_1571398823.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
