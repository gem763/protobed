Elizabeth Warren speaks at the 2019 California Democratic Party State Convention in San Francisco, June 1, 2019. (Gage Skidmore)\n\nTheir falsehoods were immoral, divisive, and quite possibly unlawful.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, two of the leading contenders in the Democratic presidential primary lied. There\u2019s no other fair way to put it. They flat-out spread fiction, libeled an innocent man, and stoked American divisions \u2014 all for political gain.\n\nFive years ago, a Ferguson, Mo., police officer named Darren Wilson shot a young black man named Michael Brown to death after an altercation in the street. False rumors about Brown\u2019s death \u2014 namely that he was shot in cold blood while trying to surrender with his hands in the air \u2014 ignited violent protests in Missouri and revulsion across the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot\u201d became a national rallying cry \u2014 until the Obama Department of Justice comprehensively and thoroughly debunked it in a lengthy report published on March 4, 2015. Writing in December of the same year, the Washington Post\u2019s Glenn Kessler called the slogan one of \u201cthe biggest Pinocchios of the year.\u201d\n\nBut Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren ignored the Obama DOJ. They blew straight through the facts of the case and published these accusations:\n\nMichael Brown\u2019s murder forever changed Ferguson and America. His tragic death sparked a desperately needed conversation and a nationwide movement. We must fight for stronger accountability and racial equity in our justice system. \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) August 9, 2019\n\n5 years ago Michael Brown was murdered by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Michael was unarmed yet he was shot 6 times. I stand with activists and organizers who continue the fight for justice for Michael. We must confront systemic racism and police violence head on. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) August 9, 2019\n\nTo demonstrate just how preposterous it is to accuse Wilson of murder, it\u2019s worth revisiting the actual facts of the case, according to the best evidence available to the investigators. On August 9, 2014, Michael Brown and a friend were walking in the middle of the street shortly after Brown had stolen cigarillos from a local market and shoved away the store clerk when he tried to intervene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Wilson first spotted Brown and his friend, he told them to walk on the sidewalk. He then realized that they matched the description of the theft suspects and blocked their path with his vehicle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilson tried to open his door, but it either bounced off Brown or Brown slammed it shut. Brown then reached into the vehicle and started punching Wilson. As Wilson fended off the blows, he reached for his gun. Brown allegedly tried to take the gun from Wilson, and Wilson managed to get a shot off, injuring Brown in the hand. Eyewitnesses corroborated Wilson\u2019s claims that Brown was reaching in the car, and these claims were further corroborated by \u201cbruising on Wilson\u2019s jaw and scratches on his neck, the presence of Brown\u2019s DNA on Wilson\u2019s collar, shirt, and pants, and Wilson\u2019s DNA on Brown\u2019s palm.\u201d\n\nBrown then started to run away. After a brief pause Wilson pursued, ordering Brown to stop. Brown then turned back to Wilson and started running toward him. According to the report, \u201cseveral witnesses stated that Brown appeared to pose a physical threat to Wilson as he moved toward Wilson.\u201d Wilson fired again, striking Brown several times, yet Brown kept moving toward Wilson until the final shot hit him in the head, killing him.\n\nThe report\u2019s conclusion was crystal clear:\n\nGiven that Wilson\u2019s account is corroborated by physical evidence and that his perception of a threat posed by Brown is corroborated by other eyewitnesses, to include aspects of the testimony of [Brown\u2019s friend], there is no credible evidence that Wilson willfully shot Brown as he was attempting to surrender or was otherwise not posing a threat. [Emphasis added.]\n\nThe report flatly declared that Wilson \u201cdid not act with the requisite criminal intent.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo credible evidence\u201d is a powerful statement, but if you read the report, it\u2019s a powerful statement based not just on extensive forensic evidence but also on the courageous testimony of witnesses who feared reprisal for speaking the truth. One witness, a 58-year-old black male, told prosecutors that there were signs in the neighborhood that said \u201cSnitches get stitches.\u201d Yet he spoke the truth anyway. Other witnesses overcame their fears and spoke the truth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow do we have confidence that they spoke the truth? Because, as the report notes, their statements \u201chave been materially consistent, are consistent with the physical evidence, and . . . are mutually corroborative.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, there were other witnesses. Some neither incriminated him nor fully corroborated him. And there was an entire category of witnesses whose accounts were \u201cinconsistent with the physical and forensic evidence,\u201d the report noted, adding:\n\nSome of those accounts are materially inconsistent with that witness\u2019s own prior statements with no explanation, credible [or] otherwise, as to why those accounts changed over time. Certain other witnesses who originally stated Brown had his hands up in surrender recanted their original accounts, admitting that they did not witness the shooting or parts of it, despite what they initially reported either to federal or local law enforcement or to the media.\n\nThere are few more fraught issues in American public life than the question of police shootings \u2014 especially police shootings of black men. I\u2019ve written about the issue time and time again and have come to believe not only that too many American police officers resort to deadly force too quickly but also that there is an unacceptable pro-police bias in our criminal-justice system. There is also evidence that race plays a more malignant role in policing than many of us hoped.\n\nIndeed, while we must of course remember the DOJ\u2019s report exonerating Darren Wilson, we should also remember that there was a second DOJ report in 2015 that found systematic misconduct at the Ferguson Police Department, misconduct that disproportionately affected Ferguson\u2019s black citizens. I urge you to read both reports, and if you read the second report with an open mind, you\u2019ll almost certainly come to believe that Ferguson\u2019s black residents possessed legitimate grievances against their police department.\n\nThat\u2019s the complicated nation we inhabit, but the complexity does not mean there aren\u2019t simple obligations that attach to every politician, activist, and member of the media. And the simplest of those obligations is a commitment to the truth. We know that lies and falsehoods can cause riots. They can cause city blocks to burn. They can destroy a man\u2019s life. At the very least, they can further embitter an already toxic public discourse. When issues are most fraught, the obligation of courageous, honest leadership is most imperative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Warren and Harris\u2019s failure is more than a failure of leadership. The publication of a false accusation of a crime like murder is libelous under American law. In other words, their lies may well have been illegal. Democrats \u2014 especially Democrats who seek to address the very real challenges surrounding police violence in the United States \u2014 should demand better. Harris and Warren should do better. They should correct and retract their false statements. There is no excuse for their inflammatory lies.", "description": "They ignored the Obama Department of Justice.
