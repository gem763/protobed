She claimed Lauer was 'dangerous' and a 'problem' at the network when she worked there over 20 years ago, leading her to wonder how executives could have been unaware of his predatory behavior.\n\nKelly, who previously worked for NBC News and was a Fox News anchor, appeared on Tucker Carlson live on Monday and pointed out that NBC never conducted an external investigation of the network after Lauer was hit with a complaint of sexual impropriety and saw his contract terminated as co-host of Today.\n\nSuch investigations were made by Fox News and CBS after claims of sexual misconduct and abuse of power came to light at the networks.\n\nAddie Zinone, a former employee at Today, also endorsed an outside investigation in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nNBC declined all three requests.\n\nLauer lost his job in November 2017 after a complaint filed by a former colleague alleged he engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.\n\nLinda Vester (above), who had accused former NBC Evening News anchor Tom Brokaw of sexual harassment, on Fox News at Night With Shannon Bream Wednesday called for a probe and claimed Lauer was 'dangerous' and a 'problem' at NBC when she had worked there\n\nMegyn Kelly (above), who previously worked for NBC News and was a Fox News anchor, appeared on Tucker Carlson live on Monday and noted NBC never conducted an external investigation of the network after Matt Lauer was hit with a complaint of sexual impropriety\n\nThe disgraced journalist, who has not worked since and recently signed off on a divorce that ended his almost 21 year marriage to model Annette Roque, faced renewed scrutiny after more alleged misdeeds were brought up in Ronan Farrow's new book, 'Catch and Kill'.\n\nFarrow, a Pullitzer Prize winner for his reporting on film producer Harvey Weinstein's own alleged sexual misconduct, which led to the 'Me Too' movement, revealed in the book that Lauer was accused of anal rape by a former NBC News producer who has received a seven-figure payout from the network.\n\nLauer has countered that the sex was consensual.\n\nNBC decided to launch a full investigation of its news division after requests for such a probe were made by journalists Linda Vester, Megyn Kelly and Addie Zinone in interviews\n\nThe six women in their letter to Comcast heralded the work of Farrow and another writer, Rich McHugh, as 'fearless', and point out that 'through dozens of interviews with current and former NBC employees,' Farrow and McHugh learned NBC knew about allegations made against Lauer, 'long before' his ouster from the network.\n\nThe women also note that the book revealed how 'certain network executives have enabled a corporate culture of widespread sexual harassment and abuse, and are still trying to cover it up today'.\n\nA senior NBC executive defended the network after the book's release, claiming that in two decades they had 'never heard any complaints about Matt Lauer' but conceded that there were multiple sexual harassment complaints against other senior broadcasters and executives.\n\nFormer NBC News producer Addie Zinone (pictured above) also endorsed an outside investigation in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter\n\nFormer CNN producer Eleanor McManus (pictured above), is also among the journalists calling for an independent probe. She also alleges disgraced author and political commentator Mark Halperina tried to kiss her when he worked for ABC and she was a 21-year-old job seeker\n\nGreta Van Susteren (pictured above) was among the journalists demanding an independent investigation. Van Susteren had her own problems with sexual harassment when she alleged she was fired from Fox News for refusing to sleep with network boss Roger Ailes\n\nThe network dealt with more than half a dozen complaints about harassment which included 'less than five' against 'extremely visible' on-air talent or executives without any being terminated, the former executive revealed.\n\nDailyMail.com has revealed that between 2001 and 2008, the network dealt with a string of complaints, 'confidentially'.\n\nThe former senior executive said none of them involved Lauer \u2013 meaning that other on-air talent were found to have committed sexual harassment but allowed to keep their jobs.\n\n'There are women who still work at NBC news, who were complaining about actions of superiors, co-workers. It happens,' the former executive said.\n\nThe female journalists calling for an independent investigation noted the book's references to NBC News Chairman Andy Lack and MSNBC President Phil Griffn, for 'a record of sexually harassing female subordinates, and how NBC News President Noah Oppeheim 'boasted about objectifying women while at Harvard Unversity.'\n\n'Are these the men you want running a news network reliant on the FCC for license renewal?' the women ask.\n\nFormer NBC Today co-host Matt Lauer came under renewed scrutiny after more allegations of sexual misconduct were brought up in a new book, 'Catch and Kill' by Ronan Farrow (pictured above)\n\nComcast, the owner of NBC, was given three demands by the six journalists, including that a full investigation be made into sexual misconduct at the network's news division, and that it be conducted by an outside, independent law firm\n\nThey present three demands to Comcast: That the company launch a full investigation into the news division at NBC, and that it be conducted by an outside, independent law firm.\n\nThey request that all current and former NBC employees be allowed to seek waivers from non-disclosure agreements they may have signed in 'sexual misconduct cases,' so they can speak 'freely and publicly.'\n\nThe six also want an 'in-person meeting of Comcast executives, directors, sexual harassment victims and advocacy leaders.'\n\nSome of the women have had their own issues with NBC.\n\nKelly, who decamped from Fox News to the 'peakcock network', was terminated 13 months into a three-year contract at NBC following pro-blackface comments.\n\nGretchen Carlson (pictured above) was among the journalists to sign the letter demanding an independent probe. Carlson had a short-lived stint on MSNBC, where her short-lived show, ' For the Record with Greta', was cancelled due to poor ratings after only six months\n\nCarlson, who also had worked for Fox, had a short-lived stint with NBC's cable division, MSNBC, where her short-lived show, 'For the Record with Greta', was cancelled due to poor ratings after only six months.\n\nVan Susteren, a veteran news woman had her own problems with sexual harassment, alleged she was let go from Fox in June 2016 after she refused to sleep with network boss Roger Ailes.\n\nShe filed a sexual harassment suit as a result and her story is among those to be featured in the upcoming film 'Bombshell.'\n\nThe movie details similar allegations made against Ailes, who resigned because of the scandal and died a year later at age 77, due to complications from hemophilia.\n\nMcManus also claims she was a victim, alleging disgraced author and political commentator Mark Halperina tried to kiss her during a meeting in his office when he worked for ABC. At the time, she was a 21-year-old job seeker.", "description": "Megyn Kelly, Greta Van Susteren, Gretchen Carlson and other journaists have demanded NBC's parent, Comcast, conduct an independent probe of sexual misconduct at the network.", "authors": ["Ralph R.
