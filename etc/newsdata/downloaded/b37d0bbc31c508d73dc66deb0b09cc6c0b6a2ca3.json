It\u2019s nothing personal, I just don\u2019t see a lifelong New Yorker understanding how important gun rights are to many in this great country. He\u2019s expressed more willingness to \u201ccompromise\u201d on guns than I\u2019m comfortable with as well.\n\nHowever, he also hasn\u2019t embraced the anti-gun arguments like I feared he might.\n\nYet after Odessa, I had concerns. Would President Trump more fully embrace gun control?\n\nWell, I have my answer.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP said Sunday the package of gun-related proposals that he and Congress are considering won\u2019t be affected by the mass shooting this past weekend in Texas. \u2018We\u2019re doing a package,\u2019 he told reporters. \u2018\u2026.That\u2019s irrespective of what happened yesterday in Texas.\u2019 He was referring to a mass shooting in which a gunman killed at least seven people and wounded 22 around Odessa. This followed other recent mass shootings in August, including one in El Paso, Texas and another in Dayton, Ohio. \u2018For the most part, as strong as you make your background checks, they would not have stopped any of it,\u2019 Trump said.\n\nSo, the president appears to be still considering at least some degree of gun control based on what happened in El Paso and Dayton, but he\u2019s not shifting more to the left on gun control than he already is.\n\nWhile I\u2019d rather see the president refuse to budge at all on guns, that\u2019s not where he is at the moment. Instead, he\u2019s looking to pass a bit, probably enough to quell concerns during the general election but not much more than that.\n\nFor better or worse, that\u2019s the best we can hope for right now.\n\nNow, I can hear someone out there talking about how the president is playing 4D-chess right now and all that jazz, but I\u2019m not interested in hearing it. He\u2019s playing 4D-chess with our right to keep and bear arms. He\u2019s proposing measures like red flag laws that mean someone can claim I\u2019m a threat and then the police will take my weapons away and I will have to prove I\u2019m not a threat in order to get them back. He\u2019s been back and forth on things like universal background checks. Hell, he\u2019s already managed more gun control than the Obama administration with the bump stock ban alone.\n\nI don\u2019t want to hear about 4D-chess.\n\nThat said, I do understand political realities. While I oppose any gun control, I also understand that politicians also feel pressured to do things they wouldn\u2019t ordinarily do or support. I get that.\n\nBut don\u2019t sell me that this is part of some \u201cgrand design.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s been little reason to take the president\u2019s word that he\u2019s a gun-rights supporter from the get-go. He was just better than the alternative. He\u2019s still better than what the alternative would have been. Trump\u2019s proposals aren\u2019t a drop in the bucket compared to what we\u2019d be dealing with if Hillary had won, and we all know it.\n\nAll of that said, the fact that he\u2019s not latching onto Odessa to justify still more gun control is something of a relief. It means that we\u2019re not going to see assault weapon bans, for one thing. It also reduces the chance of seeing universal background checks in his gun control package.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t know quite what form that package will take just yet, it\u2019ll still be far better than it could have been.", "description": "While President Trump has been far more open to gun control than many of his supporters might like, he doesn't seem swayed by Odessa.", "authors": ["Tom Knighton", "Author'S Bio", "Tom Knighton Is A Navy Veteran", "A Former Newspaperman", "A Novelist", "A Blogger", "Lifetime Shooter.
