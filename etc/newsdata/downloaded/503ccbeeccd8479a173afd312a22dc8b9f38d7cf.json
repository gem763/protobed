For some time now there have been rumours that one of the most tangible elements of AATIP related to strange materials \u2013 so-called \u201cmetamaterials\u201d \u2013 associated with UFOs.\n\n\u2018One allegation was that money had been spent on modifying buildings at Bigelow Aerospace\u2019s Nevada facility, to store these materials. Bigelow Aerospace won the AATIP contract and did much of the work.\n\n\u2018Opinion is divided about these metamaterials.\n\n\u2018Believers think this could be wreckage from the UFO they say crashed at Roswell in 1947. Sceptics suggest the materials might be nothing more remarkable than odd bits of metal found by the public over the years and associated with UFOs, more by wishful thinking than by virtue of any tangible evidence.\u2019\n\nThis drawing of a strange experimental aircraft was released in a patent document filed by the US Navy\n\nMORE: The US Navy secretly designed a super-fast futuristic aircraft resembling a UFO, documents reveal\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a recent interview with US news host Tucker Carlson, Luis Elizondo confirmed that some of these materials TTSA had collected were obtained from \u2018governmental sources\u2019.\n\n\u2018If any of this was genuinely extraterrestrial in origin, scientific testing techniques such as isotopic ratio analysis and x-ray diffraction should be able to put the matter beyond dispute,\u2019 Pope added.\n\n\u2018Considering the metamaterials in the context of these new revelations about US Army interest, the important point is that if all of this was just nonsense, the government and the military would steer clear.\n\n\u2018To engage in this way, the US Army must either know or suspect that there\u2019s a genuine technological advantage to be gained here, that collaboration with TTSA might deliver \u2013 and TTSA can legitimately be regarded as an offshoot of the US government\u2019s AATIP program, on the basis that many of the same people are involved.\n\nNick Pope greets fans and supporters at an AlienCon event\n\n\u2018The potential damage to the US Army\u2019s reputation if TTSA can\u2019t deliver anything is significant, so they must be very, very sure that there\u2019s something to all this. Therefore, the significance of this research and development agreement cannot be overstated.\u2019\n\nThe UFO community has spent decades claiming that alien technology obtained from UFO crashes was being secretly \u2018back-engineered\u2019 at Area 51 and then quietly introduced into the military.\n\nBut these claims have never been taken seriously.\n\nPope added: \u2018It was suggested that innovations such as stealth technology, night vision goggles and Kevlar body armour were all derivations from extraterrestrial technologies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018These theories were widely dismissed as nonsense, but these new revelations about the US Army\u2019s interest and involvement will only reignite such speculation, with many believing that the conspiracy theorists might have been right about this one all along.\u2019\n\nSo are we on the verge of discovering the truth about whether aliens have been visiting Earth?\n\n\u2018Whatever the truth of the matter, we\u2019ve come a long way since the end of 2017 \u2013 before when the official line from the US government was that UFOs were of no interest and that no investigations were being undertaken,\u2019 Pope added.\n\n\u2018US Congress has been looking into AATIP and the spate of recent US Navy encounters with UFOs, and classified briefings on all this have been taking place.\n\n\u2018Congress will doubtless demand to know what the US Army is doing partnering with TTSA, what they know about these bizarre metamaterials and their origin, and what technologies or capabilities they hope to derive from all this.\u2019", "description": "Are we finally going to discover the truth about 'unidentified aerial phenomena'?", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill", "Science", "Technology Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ufop-e35a-98a6_1571739975.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
