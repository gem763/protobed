You, of course, remember the undercover videos showing Planned Parenthood executives haggling over the price of baby parts, taken by David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt of the Center for Medical Progress.\n\nWay back in July 2015, California Attorney General Kamala Harris, who kept a petition defending Planned Parenthood up on her Senate campaign site, opened an investigation into whether the undercover videos violated any laws. She won her campaign and was succeeded by Xavier Becerra.\n\nIn March 2017, the State of California brought 15 felony charges against Daleiden and Merritt for \u201cthe criminal recording of conversations\u201d: that was one felony count for each person filmed without his or her consent, and a 15th count for criminal conspiracy to invade privacy.\n\nIn June 2017, the San Francisco Superior Court dismissed 14 of the 15 felony charges. However, the judge gave the state attorney general\u2019s office until mid-July to file a revised complaint. And sure enough, a week later, Becerra could refile the charges later \u2014 and that\u2019s what he did.\n\nOK.\n\nNow we missed this last week, but the trial has begun at last, and according to Life Site (the MSM isn\u2019t covering this, of course), some horrifying testimony is coming to light:\n\nLife Site reports:\n\nThe CEO of StemExpress essentially admitted in court Thursday that her biotech company supplies beating fetal hearts and intact fetal heads to medical researchers. She also admitted at the preliminary hearing of David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt of the Center for Medical Progress that the baby\u2019s head could be procured attached to the baby\u2019s body or \u201ccould be torn away.\u201d \u2026 On Thursday, the court saw video clips of the StemExpress CEO, identified as Doe 12, meeting in May 2015 with Daleiden and Merritt, who were posing as owners of a biotech company. Doe 12 says in the video there\u2019s a great demand for \u201craw fetal tissue,\u201d and that the \u201cinsanely fragile\u201d neural or brain tissue is best shipped in a \u201cwhole calvarium,\u201d or head, whereupon Daleiden says, \u201cJust make sure the eyes are closed.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d laughs Doe 12, \u201cTell the lab techs it\u2019s coming\u2026it\u2019s almost like they don\u2019t want to know what it is.\u201d\n\n(Someone tell Vox\u2019s Aaron Rupar these videos were forensically examined and determined by the court not to have \u201cmisleadingly edited.\u201d)\n\nWe were called conspiracy theorists for years when we told people this was happening. Leftists said there was no way that this was true. Well\u2026 now the companies admit it. RT & send to a Democrat so they can\u2019t say they didn\u2019t know. https://t.co/9zRAiadQWg \u2014 Robby Starbuck (@robbystarbuck) September 10, 2019\n\nBut but but Planned Parenthood does no wrong pic.twitter.com/tFmxTiaB73 \u2014 MasterNater (@you___suck___) September 10, 2019\n\nNo words \ud83d\ude25 \u2014 \u2733\ufe0f 72Girl \u2733\ufe0f (@lapdMO) September 10, 2019\n\nWe\u2019ll keep an eye on the trial as best we can. And wouldn\u2019t it be interesting if one of the reporters on Harris\u2019s campaign beat were asked to comment on the progress of the investigation she opened?\n\nRelated:", "description": "Hell yes Planned Parenthood was selling baby parts.", "authors": ["Brett T.", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/david-daleiden-microphone.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
