Warren Buffett once called his \u201cThe Indefensible\" \u2014 a nod to his criticism of corporate profligacy \u2014 but soon renamed it \u201cThe Indispensable\u201d.\n\nThe Berkshire Hathaway boss is not alone. Private plane use has risen in line with profit margins of US companies. Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts have boosted second-hand prices.\n\nBut their value is more in question than ever. It is not just a question of whether time savings and security benefits justify the financial costs. Increasingly, there is another budget to consider: carbon.\n\nSome flights are hard to justify. Famously, a RJR Nabisco boss once flew his dog by corporate jet under the passenger name \u201cG Shepherd\u201d. A spare jet followed the aircraft bearing Jeff Immelt, when he was boss of General Electric, in case of mechanical failure.\n\nAnalysis of more than 60,000 corporate flights by US academics found about a tenth went to resorts like Las Vegas.\n\nYet the same research found jet use was linked to higher returns for companies with widely-spread business sites. Cutting flight times, travel time to the airport, security and boarding procedures may outweigh a jet\u2019s financial costs.", "description": "As companies ratchet up their promises to tackle global warming, pressure to junk the jets will grow.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1887%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_97/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b4e7bb8f85f910676fc6f48bb38f88d7ec22ca72", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
