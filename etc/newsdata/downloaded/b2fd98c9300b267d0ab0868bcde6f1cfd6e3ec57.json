Whereas the PM pays a tax charge for their apartment in Downing St, Mr Bercow is not thought to contribute a penny in rent or running costs. Soon after they moved in the Bercows ordered a refurbishment of the residence that cost some \u00a320,000. They were also allowed to move a nanny into a self-contained flat on the estate - raising questions about whether the taxpayer was subsidising the family's childcare.\n\nAccording to the response, a firm was paid \u00a3490.78 in February this year to replace a 'redundant' washing machine in the nanny's flat.\n\nThe invoice stated that the task was to 'remove and scrap' one appliance, and 'supply and fit a new Hotpoint washing machine and leave in working order'.\n\nIt is the latest in a line of bills for 'white goods' that Mr Bercow has put on the public tab.\n\nHe ordered a \u00a3415 washing machine when he took the role in 2009.\n\nThe following year it broke down and Commons officials spent \u00a3438 to repair it.\n\nJust a few months later, however, it failed again and a replacement was needed, at a cost of \u00a3594.\n\nIn August 2016, there was a \u00a31,095 bill to remove a 'defective' dryer and install a new Zanussi condensing machine.\n\nThe latest disclosure shows repairing an 'entrance door' to the kitchen cost \u00a3538 in May this year, and further work to the 'side entrance door' to the residence the same month was \u00a3465.\n\nThe House authorities said there was also a record of a Christmas tree being supplied to the Speaker's residence.\n\n'We hold a record of Christmas trees being supplied to Westminster Hall and the Speaker\u2019s residence,' the response said.\n\n'These cost \u00a3370, but we cannot disaggregate the costs for the separate areas.'\n\nMr Bercow's official spending is not subject to the same rules as expenses for MPs \u2013 who are banned by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) from buying furniture or white goods.\n\nThe Speaker's aides have previously insisted the overall costs of his office have gone down since he took the role.\n\nJohn O'Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'With the Speaker claiming for his nanny's new washing machine, taxpayers will think they've been hung out to dry.\n\n'Given the number of public functions hosted in the residence, a few reasonable repairs are fair enough. But after being elected to restore trust after the expenses scandal, the speaker shouldn't be shelling out taxpayers' cash for the latest mod cons without a word of explanation.'\n\n'If he wants to finish what he started and avoid leaving a legacy of largesse, the Speaker would do well to listen to the public's concerns and be much more careful with taxpayers' hard-earned money.'", "description": "The costs of maintenance at Speaker John Bercow's residence over the past 16 months were disclosed by the House authorities in response to an FOI request.", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/13/19539264-0-image-a-16_1570711618213.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
