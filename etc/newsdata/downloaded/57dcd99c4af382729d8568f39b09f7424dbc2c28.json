Typhoon season isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nCafes where you can go to pet hedgehogs, or owls, yes. The restaurant that serves unfertilised chicken eggs still connected to the fallopian tube, certainly.\n\nBut typhoon season? May to October each year, without fail. Always has been, probably always will be. August and September are its peak periods, but mainland Japan is hit on average three times each year, with varying degrees of potency.\n\nIt should come as no surprise to anyone that this World Cup is disrupted by typhoon season\n\nThe heavy rains are coming and England's final group game has been cancelled\n\nSometimes they get away with a little rearrangement; other storms bring calamity. So a tournament that began on September 20, with 28 matches scheduled for October, was always courting trouble.\n\nThe organisers cannot say they were not warned. They have, quite literally, reaped the whirlwind.\n\nThat the 2019 Rugby World Cup now risks being blown away as it reaches the climactic weekend for the pool stage will be seen by some as simply unfortunate.\n\nThere will have been plenty of years, the majority no doubt, when games could have gone ahead untroubled as they have done so far.\n\nYet, equally, there was always the possibility of dramatic complications.\n\nAnd if it is tough on the French players who will now not get the chance to win the group, or Scotland, who may yet fly home without receiving a last chance to qualify, think of the fans.\n\nAll week in Tokyo, there has been enjoyable interaction with groups of supporters who have built holiday adventures around this tournament. Some can\u2019t afford more than one week, one game, and the showdown in Yokohama between England and France was a popular choice.\n\nMany fans will have bought flights and hotels to see England vs France only to be disappointed\n\nCertainly, no one sold them a Rugby World Cup experience that could be cancelled at three days notice. It was close to midnight on Wednesday here when the news leaked that England and France would not go ahead.\n\nTickets bought, flights booked, hotels long paid for in advance. It is not unlucky, the fate that has befallen these rugby loyalists. It is a scandal.\n\nJust as it was a scandal that the IAAF sent their World Championships to Doha and laid it on for empty stadiums, with the women\u2019s marathon turned into a route march to the emergency room, so oppressive were the conditions.\n\nJust as it was a scandal that what should have been a grand finale to the County Championship cricket season this year became an artificial encounter between the contenders Essex and Somerset and a damp squib, because a summer sport finished four days after the start of autumn.\n\nJust as it was a scandal England played Sri Lanka in monsoon season; and that the Africa Cup of Nations has now been moved to some of the continent\u2019s wettest months; or that FIFA agreed to host a World Cup in Qatar at a time of year that would have made the schedule at best unsustainable and at worst lethal.\n\nIn their desperation to grow the sport, to explore new markets, or whatever euphemism is currently in vogue to mask quite naked greed, organisers no longer consider the geographical or geopolitical challenges of their plans.\n\nSeveral matches in the 2010 edition of the Africa Cup of Nations in Angola were taken to Cabinda, an oil-rich but disputed territory that had previously suffered terrorist attacks. The bus carrying the Togolese team came under fire and three died. It was entirely avoidable.\n\nAs was this. There were three dead the last time a major typhoon hit mainland Japan, too. That was in September.\n\nTyphoon Faxai was the strongest to strike the country\u2019s Kanto region since 2004 and, in addition to the deaths, 147 were injured. As a result of a power outage affecting 934,000 there were two further deaths from heatstroke.\n\nEven so, few would argue Japan are not fine hosts of the 2019 Rugby World Cup. They deserve it, they have been brilliant at it. Coming here in typhoon season was the mistake, not coming here per se.\n\nThe empty stadium in Doha was a terrible look for the IAAF at the World Championships\n\nWorld Rugby will say that the demands of the various domestic leagues make this period in the calendar the only one that is feasible. If so, it is their job to plot and deliver the alternative.\n\nIf FIFA could do it, with the 2022 World Cup, then it is not beyond the wit of other sports. World Rugby just had to make plain the competition was moving east and then open negotiations on how that would be achieved. The lead time between the award and the event was more than a decade. It was far from impossible to avoid typhoons.\n\nFIFA wrongly, corruptly, sent their competition to Qatar in summer. At least, however, they conceded the recklessness of that decision by repositioning it as a winter tournament.\n\nNow we have a festival of football that nobody voted for \u2014 in Qatar from November 21 to December 18, 2022 \u2014 and that everyone knows was part of a crooked process.\n\nYet at least it is not going to be played in upwards of 40 degree heat. At least people are no longer at risk of death.\n\nQatar 2022 is far from satisfactory but it is the best that can be made of a bad job.\n\nTo achieve this compromise required FIFA to make deals with some of the most powerful sports administrations in the world: Europe\u2019s football leagues.\n\nWorld Rugby should have planned for this eventuality and come up with alternatives\n\nThey had to square off the Premier League, La Liga, the Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1. They had to make nice with American sports networks whose tidy domestic schedules were now to be invaded by a global soccer tournament.\n\nAnd no doubt it cost. But they did it. Just as World Rugby should have been able to take their competition to Japan without the risk of a typhoon stealing the show.\n\nIt required preparation, negotiating skills and probably, yes, compensation, too. Yet at the end of those negotiations, there would have been a tournament worthy of its dutiful host nation. Instead, the realities of the Pacific typhoon season are unavoidably apparent.\n\nMuch as they should have been 10 years ago, had anyone seen possibilities beyond the commercial.", "description": "MARTIN SAMUEL IN TOKYO: There are a lot of surprising things about Japan.
