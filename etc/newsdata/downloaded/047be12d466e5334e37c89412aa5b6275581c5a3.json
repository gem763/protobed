Rio Tinto (LON: ) was down 0.7% while Anglo American (LON: ) was down 0.4% - albeit the latter has outperformed over the last month with a gain of over 10%.\n\nInternational Consolidated Airlines Group (LON: ) was the best performer among the airlines as oil prices gave up over half of their gains since last weekend\u2019s attack on Saudi Arabian oil installations. British Airways pilots said late Wednesday they had cancelled their next one-day strike in an attempt to restart talks with management over pay and conditions. The company has yet to respond publicly. The two-day strike earlier this month had caused thousands of flights to be cancelled, BA\u2019s worst-ever day in terms of industrial relations.\n\nU.K. retailer Next (LON: ), by contrast, fell over 4% after reporting a \u201cdisappointing\u201d start to trading in the third quarter. It said it expected the fourth quarter to be stronger, helped by basis effects from a weak fourth quarter last year.\n\nElsewhere, German Internet incubator Rocket Internet (DE: ) rebounded from Wednesday\u2019s three-month low on the back of solid second-quarter results that showed it sitting on a 3 billion euro cash pile after a string of IPOs by its portfolio companies.", "description": "StockBeat: European Stocks Rise in Wake of Fed's \"Hawkish Cut\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE020E3_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
