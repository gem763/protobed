REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan\n\nOut of 21 economists surveyed in the past week, 13 predicted Bank Indonesia (BI) will trim its 7-day reverse repurchase rate IDCBRR=ECI by 25 basis points (bps) to 5.25% this week, bringing this year\u2019s total easing to 75 bps.\n\nThe other eight economists expected the central bank to stand pat.\n\nBI\u2019s policy meeting will conclude hours after the U.S. Federal Reserve meets, in which it is expected to cut rates again, following last week\u2019s easing by the European Central Bank. The Bank of Japan could also ease policy at its meeting on Thursday.\n\n\u201cSimply put, all signs call for cuts,\u201d Joseph Incalcaterra, an HSBC economist said in a note titled \u201cBank Indonesia Watch: Still room to front-load\u201d last week.\n\nHe cited improving investor sentiment for risky assets, the then-stronger rupiah, weak domestic growth and the government\u2019s reform momentum as reasons for another cut.\n\nAnalysts had predicted July\u2019s cut was the beginning of an easing cycle to unwind the central bank\u2019s tightening in 2018.\n\nBI was among the most aggressive emerging market central banks last year when it raised interest rates by 175 bps to halt capital outflows related to U.S. monetary tightening and the U.S.-China trade war that had pressured the rupiah.\n\nThis year, the central bank and government officials have expressed concerns about the global economic slowdown, saying policies should be aimed at supporting Indonesia\u2019s GDP expansion.\n\nAt its August meeting, Governor Perry Warjiyo signaled the central bank\u2019s willingness to ease policy further by saying the cuts would be followed by \u201can accommodative policy mix\u201d.\n\nBI\u2019s Deputy Governor Dody Budi Waluyo told reporters earlier this month, Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy may grow only 5% this year, below an earlier estimate of 5.1%.\n\nHowever, a key factor to Thursday's decision is the rupiah's IDR= stability, many economists have said, and the currency has lost its footing this week, weakening 1.4% since its previous peak at 13,900 per dollar on Sept. 13.\n\nNomura, who estimated BI will stay on hold, said the central bank\u2019s emphasis on policy mix \u201csuggests that it may consider options such as more macroprudential measures instead of reducing the policy rate further\u201d this week.", "description": "Indonesia's central bank is expected to cut its benchmark rate on Thursday, for the third meeting in a row, to support growth, a small majority of economists forecast in a Reuters poll.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430727700&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0E4", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
