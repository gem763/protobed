Unlike most recipes, which start with a roux, this one begins with a milk-and-egg base, which gives the dish an incredibly rich, silky taste. It\u2019s adapted from Millie Peartree, the owner of Millie Peartree Fish Fry & Soul Food restaurant in the Bronx, who has been making this dish since she was a little girl growing up in Georgia. The recipe was passed down in her family for generations, but because of the generous amount of cheese used, the dish was only made for events like Christmas and Thanksgiving. Extra-sharp Cheddar adds tartness and a layer of Colby Jack creates a gooey, molten center. If you can\u2019t find a Colby Jack blend, shredded mozzarella or a Mexican-style blend will work in its place.", "description": "There is macaroni and cheese, and then there is special occasion macaroni and cheese like this one Unlike most recipes, which start with a roux, this one begins with a milk-and-egg base, which gives the dish an incredibly rich, silky taste It\u2019s adapted from Millie Peartree, the owner of Millie Peartree Fish Fry & Soul Food restaurant in the Bronx, who has been making this dish since she was a little girl growing up in Georgia", "authors": ["Kiera Wright-Ruiz", "Amanda Hesser", "Pierre Franey", "Tara Parker-Pope", "Julia Moskin", "Lidey Heuck", "Colu Henry", "Sam Sifton", "Samantha Seneviratne", "Claire Saffitz"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/02/dining/kwr-mac-and-cheese/merlin_161591055_8827b61f-8325-4cb6-8db2-12a941eacbb0-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
