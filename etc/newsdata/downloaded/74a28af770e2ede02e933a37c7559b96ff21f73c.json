AND WHAT ARE ITS HEALTH RISKS? Obesity is defined as and adult having a BMI of 30 or over. A healthy person's BMI - calculated by dividing weight in kg by height in metres, and the answer by the height again - is between 18.5 and 24.9. Among children, obesity is defined as being in the 95th percentile. Percentiles compare youngsters to others their same age. For example, if a three-month-old is in the 40th percentile for weight, that means that 40 per cent of three-month-olds weigh the same or less than that baby. Around 58 per cent of women and 68 per cent of men in the UK are overweight or obese. Obesity can spur on conditions including type 2 diabetes, which can cause kidney disease, blindness and even limb amputations. Carrying dangerous amounts of weight has also been linked to 12 different cancers. This includes breast, which affects one in eight women at some point in their lives. Among children, research suggests that 70 per cent of obese youngsters have high blood pressure or raised cholesterol, which puts them at risk of heart disease. Obese children are also significantly more likely to become obese adults. And if children are overweight, their obesity in adulthood is often more severe.\n\nThe AAP now recommends that surgery, which costs up to $20,000 (\u00a315,600), should be considered a safe option and should be covered by insurance for young people.\n\nThey say youngsters should be eligible for surgery if their body mass index is 40 or higher, or at least 35 if they have major health problems. A BMI of 30 and above is considered obese.\n\nLead author Dr Sarah Armstrong admitted youngsters who have not gone through puberty may not be mature enough to understand the life-changing implications of surgery.\n\nThe operation causes patients to be physically sick if they overeat, or consume foods high in fat or sugar.\n\nIt can also prevent patients from taking in vital nutrients, as they can only consume a limited amount of food.\n\nBut Dr Armstrong, a professor of pediatrics at Duke University, said that age alone should not rule it out as a potential treatment.\n\nShe added: 'Children with severe obesity develop health problems earlier than those with lesser degrees of obesity, including diabetes, high blood pressure, fatty liver disease, and sleep apnoea.\n\n'Safe and effective is the message here,' she said of the review.\n\nChildhood obesity is now the number one health concern among parents in the US, topping drug abuse and smoking, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThere are 4.8million American children between ages 10 and 17 that are obese, latest figures show.\n\nObesity is a risk factor for several devastating chronic health conditions including type 2 diabetes, strokes, heart attack and even certain types of cancer.\n\nPrevention is important early in life as studies have shown that five-year-olds who are overweight are four times as likely to be obese by age 14 as children with normal weights.\n\nNearly 22 per cent of kids from families living below the federal poverty level are obese compared to 10 per cent from families living 400 percent above the poverty level.\n\nThat's a comparison of a household of four with an annual income of $25,100 (\u00a319,500) compared to a household of comparable size with an annual income of $117,680 (\u00a391,750).\n\nDiscrepancies are also apparent among races. The obesity rate among black kids is 22.2 per cent and 19 per cent of Hispanic kids are obese.", "description": "The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) made the recommendation based on a review of several studies which showed bariatric surgery to be a safe treatment option.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/09/18356528-0-In_its_latest_forecast_Public_Health_England_predicts_obesity_le-a-4_1572255686688.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
