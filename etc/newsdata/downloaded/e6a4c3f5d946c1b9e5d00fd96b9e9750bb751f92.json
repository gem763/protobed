Jim Jordan\u2019s thread of \u2018important questions\u2019 speaks volumes about Pelosi and Schiff \u2013 twitchy.com", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, has a few questions for House Democrat leadership, particularly Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, about the whistleblower\u2019s complaint and the clandestine nature of their inquiry process.\n\nThere has been a lot of noise since @SpeakerPelosi decided to call for impeachment before having the facts. Here are a few important questions: \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 12, 2019\n\nWhy did the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d write an 800+ word memo describing President Trump and President Zelensky\u2019s call based on second-hand information gleaned from a conversation that lasted just a few minutes? \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 12, 2019\n\nWhy did the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d wait 18 days to file the complaint after describing the call as \u201cfrightening\u201d in their memo? \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 12, 2019\n\nWhy and when did the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d communicate with @RepAdamSchiff\u2019s staff before filing the complaint? \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 12, 2019\n\nWhy did the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d hide from the ICIG that they met with @repadamschiff\u2019s staff by not checking the box on the whistleblower form indicating they had spoken to Congress? \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 12, 2019\n\nWhy didn\u2019t @RepAdamSchiff tell us his staff had met with the \u201cwhistleblower?\u201d \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 12, 2019\n\nWhy didn\u2019t the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d just give his memo to the Inspector General, instead of a seven page complaint dressed up with extraneous citations and media references? \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 12, 2019\n\nWhy is @RepAdamSchiff holding hearings, depositions, and interviews behind closed doors? \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 12, 2019\n\nWhy won\u2019t @RepAdamSchiff release the transcripts of these interviews, instead of leaking cherry-picked information that fits his narrative? \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 12, 2019\n\nWhy won\u2019t @RepAdamSchiff take questions from the press after these interviews, like Republicans have done? \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 12, 2019\n\nWhy does @SpeakerPelosi think we need to \u201cstrike while the iron is hot,\u201d instead of taking time for serious and thorough investigative fact-finding? \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 12, 2019\n\nWhy is @SpeakerPelosi scared to have a vote to open an official impeachment inquiry like it\u2019s been done every other time? \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 12, 2019\n\nWhy do Democrats keep making up the rules as they go along, instead of following a fair process? \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 12, 2019\n\nWhat work did the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d do with a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate? \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 12, 2019\n\nWhy do Democrats and the media keep falsely claiming President Trump pressured Ukraine? President Zelensky has repeatedly said that he wasn\u2019t pushed. \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 12, 2019\n\nWhy don\u2019t Democrats trust the American people to choose the President? The election is less than 13 months away. \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 12, 2019\n\nWhy won\u2019t Democrats focus on helping the country, instead of attacking the President with this unfair and partisan process? \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 12, 2019\n\nWhy won\u2019t the media ask these questions to @RepAdamSchiff or @SpeakerPelosi? \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 12, 2019\n\nThese are all valid questions that Pelosi and Schiff do not want to touch.\n\n***\n\nRELATED:\n\n\u2018Trying to get the US drunk\u2019: Rep.
