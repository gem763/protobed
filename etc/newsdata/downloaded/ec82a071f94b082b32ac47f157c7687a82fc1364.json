Rzeznik says he\u2019s sent straight back to the \u201990s when he sings \u201cName,\u201d for example, and always remembers where he was when he wrote the song.\n\n\u201cI was told to remember where you were and what you were doing and who you were and who you were with at those times,\u201d Rzeznik said about channeling the same energy of the \u201990s, in a Build Series interview. \u201cAnd it brings you back to that moment. It\u2019s interesting because you\u2019re reliving things.\u201d\n\nBassist Robby Takac also loves hearing the crowd singing Goo Goo Dolls songs; he calls it \u201camazing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure most bands would love to say 30 years later that their bands are still making music and people are still interested and still coming to see them and real life didn\u2019t march in front of them and make them take responsibility and do what normally people do,\u201d Takac said.\n\nLisa Lake via Getty Images Goo Goo Dolls released a new album, called \"Miracle Pill,\" on Sept. 13.\n\nBut today, Rzeznik also has other things on his mind while playing live, including the idea of connecting and the political divide in the United States.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m standing in a room full of people. And I\u2019m playing a song and all off a sudden pops into my head \u2014 half of this room voted for [Donald] Trump and half of this room voted for Hillary Clinton. But a hundred percent of these people are singing this song,\u201d he said.\n\nRzeznik hopes that in some small way, he and the band are helping bring people together through music.\n\n\u201cI truly believe that all the similarities between all of us are greater than the differences,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I believe the differences are being exploited and magnified to keep us off-balance. So music can be one tiny little venial component to the solution.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cFor the last 20 years we\u2019ve been traumatized, starting with 9/11, then two wars that we\u2019re still fighting and the financial collapse, which was just pure wholesale thievery by the oligarchs of this country. I think people are getting really sick of it. And I think we\u2019re on the cusp of a change.\u201d\n\nRzeznik speaks to that connection on the band\u2019s new album. He sings about people\u2019s obsession with fame and social media on songs like \u201cMoney, Fame and Fortune\u201d and the title track, \u201cMiracle Pill,\u201d but didn\u2019t have an agenda going in to writing the first Goo Goo Dolls album since \u201cBoxes,\u201d which came out in 2016.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I was intentionally trying to make these statements. It just sort of came out this way. But we\u2019re living in this world where we\u2019re more and more isolated,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting more and more emotionally separate from each other and more and more emotionally sick because of it. And I think a lot of that has to do with social media and the way people are isolated by themselves in front of computers. It\u2019s like, I have 10,000 friends. But yes. You\u2019ve never been in a room with them. I think people are really lacking for real human connection.\u201d\n\nMike Pont John Rzeznik and Robby Takac of the Goo Goo Dolls have a U.S. tour lined up this fall.\n\nRzeznik says instead of relying on social media for communication, he calls people on the phone and spends time with family and friends \u2015 in person. In his own way, Rzeznik is trying to build connections while staying focused on making a living and writing music for those longtime fans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a guy that has to go home and pay the bills and answer to my wife and my 2-year-old. And just, real life is so awesome,\u201d he said. \u201dI\u2019m a songwriter and that\u2019s more important than being a rock star.\u201d\n\nCheck out the full Goo Goo Dolls interview below.", "description": "Tired of the political divide, the band's frontman sees how music can help bring people together.", "authors": ["Editorial Director", "Entertainment - Huffpost"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8a420e2200005900fbb879.jpeg?cache=lysdkquhtv&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
