The proportion of those falling into this category grew as people aged, he said.\n\nThe figure of 18% is higher than other official measures of non-users, he said, because of the way the OII sampled the UK population.\n\nFigures gathered by the Office for National Statistics suggest about 7.4% of the population are non-users but this figure is drawn from data gathered for its Labour Force Survey.\n\nThis, said Dr Blank, looked at people who were in work, or might be, and excluded those who did not work, as well as other non-workers such as people with long-term disabilities or residents of care homes.\n\nBy contrast, he said, the OII survey visited people in their homes and gathered a more detailed view of Britons' online lives.\n\n\"Virtually everyone is online before age 50,\" Dr Blank told the BBC.\n\nAfter that milestone, he said, there was a \"sharp decline\" in use of about 2% a year.\n\n\"There are a lot of things about the internet that get less useful as you get older,\" he said.\n\nAs people's circle of friends and interests shrink they see less and less reason to spend time online.\n\nOther survey findings:\n\n10% do not use the net because of privacy worries\n\n40% of those earning less than \u00a312,500 do not go online\n\n70% of all respondents \"uncomfortable\" with targeted advertising and data tracking\n\n12% have been hit by computer viruses\n\n11% got abusive emails\n\nOld-fashioned ways\n\nEarlier versions of the survey found the 50-plus drop-off in net use had persisted for a long time, said Dr Blank, suggesting it was not tied to a particular age group that grew up without the net.\n\nMany of those who avoided the net could benefit if they ventured online, he said. The wide range of good health information might prove useful for many people in the 18% group.\n\nIn addition, he said, the UK government was seeking to move more of its aid and benefit systems online - many of which were targeted at the group that shunned the net.\n\n\"One of the ironies of this is that people who receive government support in various ways are people who tend to be older, poorer and less well-educated and those are exactly the people who are less likely to be online,\" he said.\n\n\"That presents a dilemma for the government as making contact has to be done in the old-fashioned way which is time-consuming and expensive,\" he said.\n\nFollow-up work would involve looking into ways to reach non-users and tempting them to use the net.\n\nThe OII survey was sponsored by the UK's Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport as well as tech firms BT and Google.", "description": "Survey says almost everyone under 50 is online but after that, use declines by about 2% per year.", "authors": ["Mark Ward", "Technology Correspondent", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17ED4/production/_108640089_gettyimages-680512562.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
