Germany\u2019s share of EU budget contributions \u201cwill rise tremendously ... But we are ready to take more, also financial, responsibility for the success of the European Union,\u201d he said, while noting their position would remain \u201crealistic.\u201d\n\nThe 1 percent figure would see significant reduction from the Commission\u2019s budget blueprint \u2014 a move that, if enacted, would worsen the political fight over how to split spending between programs ranging from regional funds to agriculture to research, as well as raising questions over how new objectives such as a \u201cEuropean Green Deal\u201d would be financed.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s plan would spend \u20ac1.135 billion in commitments \u2014 equivalent to 1.11 percent of the EU27\u2019s GNI, while the European Parliament has advocated for a budget of 1.3 percent.\n\nEquivalent spending for the last budget period stood at 1.03 percent of GNI across all 28 EU countries. It is estimated that if the EU budget remains at that level, the growth of the German economy combined with the U.K.\u2019s departure could see Berlin on the hook to pay around \u20ac10 billion more each year than at present.\n\nA spokesperson for the German Permanent Representation to the EU declined to comment, stating that \u201cas a matter of principle we don\u2019t comment on alleged leaks.\u201d\n\nIn the document \u2014 Germany\u2019s response to a series of questions posed by the Finnish presidency to every country to help it broker a deal later this fall \u2014 Berlin also made the case for safeguarding money flowing to poorer German regions.\n\n\u201cCohesion funding for German regions needs to be balanced and in line with the general principle that changes should not be disproportionate, which is unfortunately not the case in the Commission's current proposal, in particular for the German transition regions in the Eastern L\u00e4nder,\u201d the government told the Finnish presidency. Officials are concerned that under the current plan, those regions would lose out as struggling southern economies see a boost in allocations.\n\nGermany also made clear it does not want budget rebates to disappear after the U.K. leaves the bloc. It is one of a handful of countries alongside Sweden, the Netherlands, Austria and Denmark that also benefits from a reduction in contributions.\n\n\u201cThe German net contribution will drastically deteriorate in the next MFF, mainly due to Brexit, changes in our GNI share, and the reduction in our cohesion envelope,\u201d the government wrote, indicating it expects to become an even larger net contributor beyond 2021.\n\n\u201cThis is only acceptable if fair burden sharing is guaranteed. For this, permanent corrections for excessive contributions are indispensable,\u201d the government wrote.\n\n\u201cThe climate target should amount to at least 25% with an effective methodology for tracking climate spending\" \u2014 German government document\n\nThe Commission and countries such as France without a rebate argue these corrections should be phased out once the U.K. departs.\n\nHowever, Berlin noted it does not see any need for the creation of new financial resources for the EU budget \u2014 known as own resources \u2014 which the Commission argues would reduce the amount that countries need to contribute.\n\nThe document also shows climate-related spending targets are important for Berlin.\n\n\u201cThe climate target should amount to at least 25% with an effective methodology for tracking climate spending; the MFF as a whole should contribute to the implementation of the Paris Agreement effectively,\u201d the government wrote.\n\nFor the Horizon Europe research program, this target should be at least 35 percent, and within external aid funding, \u201c40% of its overall financial envelope should contribute to climate objectives,\u201d the government wrote.\n\nUnder the Common Agricultural Policy, the climate target should be at least 40 percent and \u201ceffective guardrails at EU-level should be introduced ... e.g. minimum quota for eco-schemes,\u201d Germany said.", "description": "Document shows Berlin\u2019s negotiating stance for upcoming budget talks.", "authors": ["Lili Bayer", "Emmet Livingstone", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20181113_EP-078695A_WT5_003-1-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
