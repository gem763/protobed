But they are finding the concept elusive.\n\nThe Democratic presidential campaigns are currently in the throes of what they think is a debate about \u201celectability.\u201d But they are finding the concept elusive because Democrats find it easier to talk around their issues than state them bluntly in public.\n\nThe concept of \u201celectability\u201d is usually applied to front-runner Joe Biden, but his campaign has been the source of some of the most inane comments about it. \u201cYour candidate might be better on, I don\u2019t know, health care than Joe is,\u201d Jill Biden told voters in New Hampshire, \u201cbut you\u2019ve got to look at who\u2019s going to win this election. And maybe you have to swallow a little bit and say, \u2018Okay, I sort of personally like so-and-so better.\u2019 But your bottom line has to be that we have to beat Trump.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Joe\u2014shooting himself in the foot as usual\u2014told the Washington Post\u2019s Jonathan Capehart \u201calmost anybody\u201d can beat President Trump.\n\nAs Joe rambled on, however, he stumbled closer to his actual theory about electability: \u201cI mean, I get overwhelming support from working-class folks of all backgrounds, and at the same time I get significant support in my career from African Americans as well as I get support from folks who have decided that we weren\u2019t listening to them and voted for Trump last time. There\u2019s not that many of them that switched, but the point is it\u2019s a combination of turning out the vote and turning back that, those couple hundred thousand votes, less than that probably, that actually went to Trump, because we stopped talking to their concerns.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s rivals and skeptics have a different theory of electability, though usually not expressed as such these days. At a big NAACP dinner in Detroit, Kamala Harris said: \u201cThere has been a conversation by pundits about \u2018electability\u2019 and \u2018who can speak to the Midwest.\u2019 But when they say that, they usually put the Midwest in a simplistic box and a narrow narrative. And too often their definition of the Midwest leaves people out. It leaves out people in this room, who helped build cities like Detroit.\u201d Democratic pollster Diane Feldman tells CNBC\u2019s John Harwood that the \u201ccapacity to motivate younger voters is enormously important,\u201d an implicit dig at Biden\u2019s relative weakness with that demographic.\n\nIn the simplest terms, Biden\u2019s theory of electability involves getting back some Obama-Trump voters, while the left would prefer to get back at Obama-Trump voters. This is why Biden\u2019s detractors generally avoid explaining their theory of electability at length.\n\nBefore Donald Trump descended his escalator, Democrats were more open in discussing and promoting their progressive theory how they get elected. Since the publication of \u201cThe Emerging Democratic Majority\u201d in 2002, the party\u2019s elites have embraced the idea that capturing younger voters as the electorate became more racially diverse would lead to a political realignment lasting decades (that the book did not promise this became quite beside the point). The election of Barack Obama, a progressive swept into office with high turnout from minorities and younger voters, was often said to validate the strongest version of this theory. Democratic pollsters began focusing on the \u201cRising American Electorate\u201d of unmarried women, millennials and non-white voters as a lens through which our politics should be viewed.\n\nUntil 2016, perhaps the biggest problem with the idea that electing Obama proved the strong version of \u201cemerging Democratic majority\u201d theory was that Obama did not strictly practice it himself. Particularly in 2008, Obama at least went through the motions necessary to not lose too many blue-collar white voters. (This is why his private comments about small-town Pennsylvanians bitterly clinging to guns and religion were so scandalous.) Indeed, Obama has advised the 2020 candidates he met \u201cto always show up and make their case even in areas or in front of audiences they may not necessarily win.\u201d\n\nThe 2016 election laid bare the flaws in the strong version of \u201cemerging Democratic majority\u201d theory. The left blames the result on racism, which may comfort them but leaves out a multitude of factors.\n\nBarack Obama was a talented politician who became a historic figure; Hillary Clinton was not and did not. Clinton wanted to be the first female president, but young women tended to vote for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primaries. She lagged with the \u201crising American electorate\u201d in the general election. The next Democratic nominee may well be a better candidate than Hillary because that\u2019s a very low bar. There is no guarantee the next Democratic nominee will be nearly as good a politician as Obama was.\n\nThat Trump won in no small part on the votes of former Obama voters suggests that racism was not the determinative factor in 2016. The left also tends to conflate racism and white identity politics, when the connection is fairly weak. Moreover, linking support of Trump to his stances on race and identity may reverse cause and effect. The left\u2019s rationalization further ignores that Trump otherwise was considered to be a moderate candidate relative to his GOP rivals, despite the number of liberal pundits who recognized it in real time.\n\nProgressives bitterly clinging to the strong version of \u201cemerging Democratic majority\u201d theory are not fighting the last war; they\u2019re fighting the war before the last war. For example, the Trump era has made education (in the sense of white-collar versus blue-collar) more politically salient than it has been in decades, particularly among white voters. In 2018, Democrats won the House largely on the votes of suburban, college-educated whites, particularly women.\n\nIn addition to regaining more blue-collar whites Democrats lost in 2016, Democratic campaigns ought to be thinking about how to retain these higher-income suburban white voters. Spoiler alert: proposing multi-trillion dollar programs to transform the economy is probably not how you do this.\n\nMost of all, Democrats would do well to learn that every winning president forges his (or her) own coalition. Whatever one thinks of \u201cemerging Democratic majority\u201d theory, strong or weak, no one in the field currently fulfills it. Biden appeals more to African-Americans, moderates, conservatives, and older voters. Elizabeth Warren appeals to the farthest-left voters and those with college degrees. Sanders also appeals to the left, but more to younger voters.\n\nThe Democratic nominee in 2020 will have to run his or her campaign, not follow someone else\u2019s theory of electability. And if various factions of the Democratic Party cannot get on board with that, perhaps President Trump is not the existential threat to the republic they have claimed he is.", "description": "Democratic presidential campaigns are currently in the throes of what they think is a debate about 'electability.'
