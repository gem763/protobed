The commemoration intends \u201cto bring generations of football fans, players, communities, and all 32 clubs together for a unique line-up of programming andactivities.\u201d\n\nOLDEST LIVING AMERICAN WWII VETERAN CELEBRATES 110TH BIRTHDAY\n\nOne of those activities I would like all NFL clubs to embrace this season is honoring the \u201cGreatest Generation.\"\n\nTwo players were awarded the Medal of Honor for their World War II service: Jack Lummus of the New York Giants, who was killed in action; and Maurice Britt of the Detroit Lions.\n\nWorld War II claimed the lives of 21 active or former NFL players in all, a former head coach and a team executive.

George Patton.\n\nNew Orleans quarterback Drew Brees\u2019 grandfather, Robert Ray Akins, served in the Marines on Okinawa, and Drew\u2019s other grandfather, Col. Eugene Wilson Brees, served in the Army in the China-India-Burma Theater.\n\nC LICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nLegendary Dallas Cowboys Coach Tom Landry completed 30 combat missions with the Army Air Forces and survived a crash landing in Belgium after his bomber ran out of fuel.\n\nAnd my good friend, Buffalo Bills owner Ralph Wilson, served as a lieutenant commander in the Navy and was commanding officer of the minesweeper USS Picket.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNFL clubs participating in the \u201cSalute to Service\u201d program take a little time during one home game during the season to recognize men and women in uniform.
