Many organizations aren't even aware just how much is actually kept in different databases across the firm. Now CEOs and boards of directors are rushing to try to catalog all that information and, given the immense amount of data, needing to bring in vendors to help accomplish that task.\n\nBusinesses \"don't even know what data they have,\" Satyen Sangani, the CEO and cofounder of Alation, a data-services company in Redwood City, California, told Business Insider. \"They don't even know what data exists about these consumers.\"\n\nAlation is one of a slew of vendors that help companies like Safeway Albertson, eBay, and General Electric create and curate \"data catalogs\" \u2014 think a warehouse of data that is structured in a common and searchable format. Others include Waterline, Okera, and Privacera, all of which, in speaking with Business Insider, described the accelerated pace under which firms were tackling the data-organization challenge because of new or incoming legislation.\n\nCalifornia is introducing its privacy law in January, while the European Union implemented its own measure last year. Broader digital transformation and the race to implement machine learning are also pushing enterprises to a crop of data-service shops.\n\n'As the fines begin to roll out, people are getting really worried': New privacy laws have organizations on the ropes\n\nCalifornia's law effectively empowers consumers to have greater control of their personal data online by requiring companies to, among other things, allow users to prohibit organizations from selling their information.\n\nCompanies are scrambling to ensure compliance ahead of its January implementation. Okera, one of the vendors that offer data security services, is fielding new calls just a few months ahead of time. Even with the pending deadline, however, some firms are waiting to see how aggressively the law is enforced \u2014 under the measure, consumers can sue for $750 per violation \u2014 or whether further guidance is provided.\n\nAmandeep Khurana is the CEO and cofounder of the data-privacy firm Okera. Okera\n\n\"A lot more people are talking to us. The challenge is people are not yet acting on it,\" Amandeep Khurana, the CEO and cofounder of the data-privacy firm Okera, said. \"Some aspects of the law are not clearly defined \u2026 which is preventing people from making big decisions.\"\n\nCalifornia's measure is the nation's first sweeping privacy law, though others could soon follow. It is similar, though not exactly the same, to Europe's General Data Protection Regulation. While that statute took effect last year, it is leading to a bump in inbound calls to data-security vendors \u2014 particularly as more companies, like Marriott or British Airways, are subject to penalties.\n\n\"As the fines begin to roll out, people are getting really worried,\" Waterline founder Alex Gorelik told Business Insider. \"It's a real nightmare.\"\n\nAlex Gorelik is the cofounder of Waterline. Waterline\n\nUnlike in the past, when organizations would hire firms like PricewaterhouseCoopers (now known as PwC) to do internal audits of their data, even missing a small silo of information among millions of sets could expose the companies to legal liability or, in the case of a leak like Capital One's, bad publicity.\n\nThat is where companies like Alation and Waterline are stepping in. \"Manually, it just doesn't work,\" Gorelik said. \"People are now spending real money to address it.\"\n\nAs consumers become more empowered, companies need to track data better\n\nMachine-learning tools can automatically wade through millions of rows of information and automatically code different lines based on the inputs that companies provide \u2014 like addresses, Social Security numbers, or even T-shirt size.\n\nOnce that data is tagged, companies can go back and assign sensitivity levels to huge groups of information. Social Security numbers, for example, would be ranked a higher sensitivity than email addresses or T-shirt sizes. That can help determine how widely to allow access within the organization.\n\nOften, companies will open these databases for employees to use to test new AI-based applications. Products like Okera's create unique dashboards for each worker based on what their access level is. The landing pages vary but often allow users to search in a manner similar to a web browser for broad categories, then view top-line summaries of which data is included, as well as specific data fields.\n\nWhile a small segment of employees may have access to the more confidential information, a wider swath is likely to be able to view and use a category like home addresses for testing advanced applications that rely on location data, like programs that help telecommunications companies decide where they should put new 5G towers based on where the signals will be most effective.\n\nRead more: Sweeping regulations like California's upcoming privacy bill threaten to wipe out the advertising industry. These 10 tech companies are trying to help marketers survive.\n\n\n\nThe new privacy laws also require companies to have a business justification for collecting data from customers. Pizza companies, for example, must obtain consent before it can use your address for marketing purposes. The database tools allow companies to easily tag those when consent has been given to use data for reasons other than the stated purpose.\n\nConsumers can request an audit of what data on them a company has stored. Being able to automatically assign customer information to data makes that task much easier. Now, instead of having to spend weeks pulling from various databases, an organization can pull up all the stored information by selecting a specific user.\n\nFor many organizations, this is the first time they are undergoing the effort of cataloging all of their data. Vendors can help make that task much easier and leave companies to focus on the larger issues, like figuring out how to use that customer information or other data to generate new revenue.", "description": "New privacy laws in California and Europe, along with efforts to use artificial intelligence, are forcing companies to take stock of their data.", "authors": ["Joe Williams"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8e47d22e22af7d317fb9c9?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
