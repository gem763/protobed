The above image was taken in Cumberland, Maine, on Thursday\n\nThe image above shows a tree which fell onto two cars in the driveway of a home in Cumberland, Maine, before dawn on Thursday\n\nThe wind gusts were so fierce that they tore off the roof of a Delta Airlines hangar at Boston\u2019s Logan Airport, according to local media.\n\nAt least 50 flights were canceled at Logan, with more cancellations expected through Friday.\n\n\u2018Like everywhere else, Logan had strong winds overnight (some reports say gusts up to 70mph) and that caused some damage,\u2019 a spokeswoman for MassPort, which runs the airport, told The Boston Globe.\n\n\u2018Part of the Delta hangar membrane was blown off, this is the flexible material that covers the steel structure. No injuries.\u2019\n\nIn a statement, Delta Airlines said that its \u2018aircraft maintenance hangar sustained wind damage from storms overnight and teams will be inspecting the damage today.\n\n\u2018There are no reported injuries or aircraft damage.\n\n\u2018No related impact to Delta\u2019s flights is expected today, but we always recommend customers use the Fly Delta app to check their flight status and get real-time updates.\u2019\n\nUtility workers were busy restoring service to customers across Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maine, and Vermont, the Globe reported.\n\nA tree blocks a roadway in Thomaston, Maine, on Thursday morning after a 'bomb cyclone' battered New England\n\nThe above image shows a downed utility line in Knox County, Maine, early Thursday morning\n\nSome 208,000 Mainers were left without power early Thursday morning as a result of heavy wind gusts\n\nThe nor\u2019easter, known as a \u2018bomb cyclone,\u2019 formed rapidly off the northeast Atlantic coast on Wednesday evening.\n\nIn Massachusetts, 216,595 customers were without power as of 11am on Thursday.\n\nFive Massachusetts towns - Aquinnah, Essex, New Ashford, Petersham, and Warwick - were completely without power, according to the Globe.\n\nIn Maine, some 208,000 customers were without electricity, according to WABI-TV.\n\nVermont reported 8,866 power outages as of 9.47am on Thursday, according to the Globe.\n\nThe low pressure system quickly formed off the northeast Atlantic coast on Wednesday afternoon\n\nWind watches and advisories are in effect for the northeast corridor stretching from West Virginia all the way to northeastern Maine\n\nFierce wind gusts were reported throughout the Northeast on Thursday morning, with Boston and Nantucket getting hit the hardest\n\nThe storm also brought rainfall to the region, with New York State and Vermont getting the brunt of the precipitation\n\nThursday's forecast calls for rain throughout the Northeast United States. Temperatures are expected to dip below 50 degrees in some areas\n\nThe above map shows the maximum wind gusts observed in the previous 24 hours. Provincetown on Massachusetts' Cape Cod recorded gusts of 90mph\n\nIn the coastal Massachusetts town of Duxbury, all schools were closed as roadways were blocked by downed trees.\n\n\u2018This whole town got hit pretty hard,\u2019 Duxbury Fire Captain Rob Reardon told ABC News. \u2018You can tell by just the amount of trees, the wires, the damage to houses. Roads are blocked, schools are shut down because school buses can't access these streets at all.\n\n\u2018We're having a difficult time trying to get to calls from one side of town to the other. Luckily no injuries.\u2019\n\nReardon urged the public not to touch any exposed electrical wires.\n\n\u2018Our biggest concern is as people wake up... they see wires down and they go and touch them,\u2019 Reardon said.\n\n\u2018If you see wires, we don't know if they're energized or not, so please call us.\u2019\n\nMassachusetts Governor Charlie Baker said restoring power to residents was \u2018job number one\u2019 though the windy conditions are presenting challenges to crews on the ground.\n\nConcerned residents try to stabilize the 55-foot sailboat Fearless, which was damaged after it washed into a wharf in Mattapoisett harbor on Thursday morning in Mattapoisett, Massachusetts\n\nA house is trapped under a tree that toppled from strong winds in Danvers, Massachusetts, on Thursday\n\nTom Miller of South Boston takes a photo of this boat that was beached following strong winds in Boston on Thursday\n\nThe above image shows a downed power line in Belfast, Maine, on Thursday morning\n\n\u2018That is probably going to limit how much and how fast people can get up in the trucks and do some of this work,\u2019 Baker said of the weather conditions.\n\n\u2018When the wind gets above a certain number of miles per hour... it gets pretty dangerous. And there were wind gusts last night that were way north of 50 miles an hour, way north.\u2019\n\nThe governor said he, too, experienced a loss of power \u2018briefly\u2019 at 2:30am.\n\nThe nor\u2019easter is considered record-breaking, according to meteorologists. The atmospheric pressure at Logan Airport fell to 975.3 millibars at 4:54am, which is an all-time low for a storm in October in Boston.\n\nThe last record was set in October 2006, when the atmospheric pressure measured 982.4 millibars.\n\nRecords for October were also set in Providence, Rhode Island, and Concord, New Hampshire, according to The Weather Channel.\n\nThe rapid drop in atmospheric pressure qualifies the nor\u2019easter as a \u2018bomb cyclone\u2019 - the low pressure system that forms when pressure drops by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours or less.\n\nThe nor'easter formed off New Jersey, strengthening as it traveled north. New York authorities said a wind-driven fire destroyed three houses in the Fire Island hamlet of Ocean Bay Park early Thursday.\n\nNo injuries were reported.\n\nTrain delays, power outages and school cancellations were reported throughout the region Thursday morning.\n\nThe Free Hell'n sits on rocks next to the town boat ramp after an overnight storm caused boats to come loose from their moorings in Scituate Harbor in Scituate, Massachusetts\n\nA broken power line is suspended in the air along Pine Street in Danvers, Massachusetts on Thursday\n\nDanvers, Massachusetts is a suburb north of Boston.
