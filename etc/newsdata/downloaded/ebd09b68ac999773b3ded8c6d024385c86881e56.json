He was shot to death with an illegal handgun such as Trump seems to shrug off as just a factor of American life even as he makes us great again.\n\nAs recounted by a sheriff investigator\u2019s probable cause affidavit, the cheerleader was 17-year-old Juliana Serrano. She had an after-school job at the Rock Bar and Restaurant in Aurora and worked on the night of May 8. Juliana\u2019s mother, Lisa Serrano, was there, celebrating her 40th birthday. The mother later told police that her daughter departed around 9 p.m. in the company of three male teens. The mother identified one of them as 17-year-old Kenneth Gallegos.\n\nJuliana Serrano was at the wheel of her silver Mazda. Gallegos was in the front passenger seat. The two other teens, identified as 18-year-old Dominic Stager and 16-year-old Demarea Deshawn Mitchell, were in the back. Stager is old enough for them to have legally purchased vape juice at a store, but they were allegedly looking to score some for nothing.\n\n\u201cIt was the plan to steal the juice from Lloyd from the beginning,\u201d the affidavit says Juliana told an investigator.\n\nThe four allegedly headed for Lloyd\u2019s home.\n\n\u201cThey were talking about what was going to \u2018go down,\u2019\u201d the affidavit says. \u201cThey were hoping [Lloyd] would give her the \u2018stuff\u2019 and they were going to drive off. But if he did not, they were going to scare Lloyd. They weren\u2019t going to shoot him. They were not going to kill him, which was never the plan.\u201d\n\nThey arrived just before 9:30 p.m.\n\n\u201c[Juliana] sent Lloyd a text letting him know she was there,\u201d the affidavit says she later told investigators.\n\nLloyd had been at a volleyball game earlier that night and had arrived home not a half hour before. His sister, Frankie Chavez, was in the living room watching television when Lloyd got the text.\n\n\u201cLloyd went outside to \u2018sell something,\u2019\u201d the affidavit says, summarizing an interview with Frankie.\n\nLloyd emerged from the house and proved to be more cautious than Juliana and the three other teens had hoped.\n\n\u201cIt was their plan to have Lloyd give her the juice and she would drive off,\u201d the affidavit says. \u201cBut he did not have it on him when [he] first approached them.\u201d\n\nThe affidavit adds, \u201cLloyd walked up to her window and asked if she had the money. She told him she did.\u201d\n\nJuliana had not been prepared actually to pay.\n\n\u201c[Juliana] had to look for it, then gave it to him,\u201d the affidavit says. \u201cShe handed the half-folded money to Lloyd. She thinks the outside bill was a $1 bill. She thinks she did see a $10 bill as well as several additional $1 bills.\u201d\n\nOnly then did Lloyd go to fetch the vape juice.\n\n\u201cLloyd did not say anything to her as he walked away but did put the money in a pocket,\u201d the affidavit says.\n\n\u201c Deputy DeVries responded to the address and observed several people in the doorway of the residence screaming. \u201d\n\nJuliana remained in the car as at least two of the other teens climbed out. A gunshot rang out and Lloyd ran into his house.\n\n\u201c[Lloyd] screamed, screamed, screamed, screamed,\u201d the affidavit quotes Juliana as saying.\n\nFrankie later told investigators that the screaming was preceded by a loud \u201cpop.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe heard Lloyd yell and he then came back inside and told her to call 911 because he had been shot,\u201d the affidavit says, \u201cShe used Lloyd\u2019s phone to call 911.\u201d\n\nA sheriff\u2019s deputy arrived minutes later.\n\n\u201cDeputy DeVries responded to the address and observed several people in the doorway of the residence screaming,\u201d the affidavit says. \u201c[DeVries] observed a male lying just inside the front door on his back.\u201d\n\nThe affidavit continues, \u201cDeVries observed blood on Lloyd as well as one the carpet around him. [DeVries] saw a small entrance wound to Lloyd\u2019s right chest just to the right of his nipple and it was barely bleeding\u2026 Lloyd was not conscious, but was breathing\u2026 Frankie was hysterical.\u201d\n\nParamedics arrived. They covered the hole with a piece of material.\n\n\u201cOnce a chest seal was applied to the wound, Lloyd began to open his eyes a little and move around but was still just moaning and not able to speak,\u201d the affidavit says.\n\nDeVries rode in the ambulance with Lloyd.\n\n\u201cLloyd was in and out of consciousness, but was not able to answer any questions,\u201d the affidavit says. \u201cUpon arrival at the hospital, Deputy DeVries collected Lloyd\u2019s jeans which were cut [off]. The jeans were wet and had blood on them. Lloyd\u2019s shoes were collected and were wet. In Lloyd\u2019s jean pocket was a wallet containing cash, a credit card, his driver\u2019s license and a student ID from Cherokee Trail High School.\u201d\n\nLloyd was briefly stabilized to where he could talk. DeVries asked Lloyd who shot him. The affidavit reports that his response was recorded by DeVries\u2019 body camera.\n\n\u201cKenny.\u201d\n\nLloyd was then wheeled in for surgery. DeVries returned to the crime scene and joined in searching for shell casings.\n\n\u201cWhile on scene, Deputy DeVries was notified that Lloyd had passed away during surgery,\u201d the affidavit says.\n\nThe affidavit reports that Lloyd\u2019s family was so manifestly distraught at the hospital that the facility was \u201con lockdown.\u201d The investigator \u201cdid not speak with anyone at the hospital due to their emotional state except for a brief conversation with Lloyd\u2019s mother.\u201d The mother, Cathy Spencer, had not been present at the time of the shooting. She said she had communicated with her son via text.\n\n\u201cJust confirming they were getting together for Mother\u2019s Day,\u201d the affidavit says.\n\nThe subsequent autopsy confirmed that the cause of death was a single gunshot wound.\n\n\u201cThe bullet was recovered from the abdomen and found to be a .22 caliber bullet,\u201d the affidavit says.\n\nSheriff investigators interviewed a friend who had been to the volleyball game with Lloyd and had dropped him off at his home less than 15 minutes before the shooting. The friend told the investigators that Lloyd said he was going to be selling vape juice to Juliana Serrano that night.\n\nWhen investigators arrived at the Serrano house, the mother told them that Juliana was in her room with her boyfriend, Kenny. The investigators called for backup and arrested the two without incident.\n\nA search failed to produce a gun. Juliana declined to permit the investigators to examine the contents of her cellphone and they obtained a search warrant.\n\n\u201c They went inside and went upstairs to her room. They put a movie on. She talked about how scared and shocked she was. Kenny told her it was okay because they did not do anything. \u201d\n\n\u201cThe last message is one from Juliana that has a picture of what she wants to buy from Lloyd and Lloyd responds to her with his address.\u201d\n\nInvestigators questioned Juliana in her kitchen while her mother listened from the living room. The interview summary reports, \u201cAfter the incident, they are all \u2018freaking out.\u2019 It was never their intention to go there and shoot Lloyd. They were all shocked and did not know what to do.\u201d\n\nShe said Kenny came home with her, having been ejected from his own home a few days before.\n\n\u201cThey went inside and went upstairs to her room,\u201d the affidavit says, \u201cThey put a movie on. She talked about how scared and shocked she was. Kenny told her it was okay because they did not do anything.\u201d\n\nThe affidavit says she told the investigator that after the shooting one of the teens had brought back the folded bills she had given Lloyd.\n\n\u201cJuliana and her mother allowed us to recover the money from her backpack, which we did,\u201d the affidavit says. \u201cThe money was folded as she described and was $25.\u201d\n\nAs Lloyd\u2019s coach and classmates mourned the loss of someone they called a star both on and off the field, Juliana Serrano, Kenny Gallegos, and Dominic Stager pleaded not guilty after being charged as adults with felony murder. Demarea Mitchell has been charged as a juvenile. Juliana and Kenny have moved to be also treated as juveniles. The two are due back in court for hearings in October.\n\nBy then, flavored vapes may be banned.\n\nLikely nothing meaningful will have been done to address gun violence\u2014even as it claims an average of 100 Americans more in an afternoon than vapes have killed in a year.", "description": "Lloyd Chavez was shot to death over $25 worth of flavored vape juice.
