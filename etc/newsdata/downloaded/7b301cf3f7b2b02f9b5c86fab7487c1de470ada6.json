Shortly before we left, though, we realized we wouldn\u2019t be able to use our AirPods on the same phone. Instead, to share audio, we had to cobble together a Lightning-to-headphone jack adapter, a cheap headphone splitter from our local pharmacy, and two pairs of Bose headphones that we borrowed from family. It was a lot of cords \u2014 and a lot of trouble.\n\nNow Apple has a solution for the exact problem we ran into. If you\u2019re running iOS 13.1 or iPadOS 13.1 or later, you can share the audio from one iOS device to two pairs of AirPods or compatible Beats headphones. It\u2019s really handy \u2014 my fianc\u00e9e and I have used it to listen to music together while running.\n\nDo you have these headphones and iPhones?\n\nFirst thing you need to do is figure out whether you\u2019ve got the right devices. The feature is currently limited to the following headphones:\n\nAirPods\n\nAirPods Pro\n\nPowerbeats Pro\n\nPowerbeats 3\n\nBeats Solo Pro\n\nBeats Solo 3 Wireless\n\nBeats Studio 3 Wireless\n\nBeatsX\n\nAccording to Apple, you\u2019ll need to be running iOS or iPadOS 13.1 or later on one of the following devices to use the feature:\n\niPhone 8 and later\n\niPad Pro (12.9-inch) second generation and later\n\niPad Pro (11-inch)\n\niPad Pro (10.5-inch)\n\niPad (fifth generation and later)\n\niPad Air (third generation)\n\niPad mini (fifth generation)\n\niPod touch (seventh generation)\n\nHow to set up audio sharing\n\nHere\u2019s how you set it up. For this how-to, I\u2019ll focus on AirPods, but it should work similarly for other compatible headphones.\n\nWith your AirPods on, start playing audio on your iPhone.\n\nNext, tap the icon with the triangle and three circles that should be near your onscreen audio controls. (That icon can also be found in the audio playback section of the Control Center and on the audio playback block on your lock screen.)\n\nIn that menu, tap \u201cShare Audio...\u201d\n\nFrom here, you have two options. You can either:\n\nBring your friend\u2019s iPhone close to yours, and they\u2019ll get a pop-up on their device to accept the audio you\u2019re sharing. Have your friend put the AirPods in their case, and bring the case close to your iPhone. That will prompt instructions to temporarily pair your friend\u2019s AirPods to your iPhone.\n\nThat\u2019s it! Once you\u2019re both connected, the host iPhone controls the volume level on both sets of headphones. Each person can also control their own audio independently using their headphone controls.", "description": "If you\u2019re running iOS 13.1 or iPadOS 13.1 or later, you can share the audio from one iOS device to two pairs of AirPods or compatible Beats headphones.", "authors": ["Jay Peters", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SivkdQUMVDIAW3J0MEvirrcaljw=/0x144:2000x1191/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16317001/lcimg_55af617f_1286_45f5_bc41_4cf5fcf7aa60__1_.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
