They had a seven-point lead over City before the two met at the Etihad Stadium on January 3, only to lose as Pep Guardiola\u2019s side began their fightback.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s far too early. We\u2019re almost in October and the busy period will come,\u201d said the Holland captain after Liverpool registered their 16th successive Premier League victory.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

We don\u2019t want to look at the others because there\u2019s no point doing that.\n\n\u201cEveryone realises that as well because last season we saw how it turned quickly. We just want to focus on the game ahead of us.\u201d\n\nVictory at Bramall Lane also extended the club record for successive away wins to eight and they have not lost outside of Anfield in the league since that defeat at the Etihad almost 10 months ago, their best run since 1989.\n\nBut attention quickly turns to Wednesday\u2019s visit of Red Bull Salzburg as Klopp\u2019s side look to register their first Champions League win of the season after defeat in their opening game against Napoli.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the media who love statistics. The reality is we have nothing at the moment. We want to continue to do well and there\u2019s still plenty of room for improvement,\u201d added Van Dijk.\n\n\u201cWe have to be confident; you have to think you\u2019re going to win every game otherwise you might as well stay at home. We have the quality, we have the players.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take this, recover and then prepare for Salzburg and that will be a tough game as well. We have to win every game, that\u2019s how it is.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Liverpool FC defender Virgil Van Dijk has dismissed the five-point lead they hold over title rivals Manchester City as irrelevant at this stage of the season.
