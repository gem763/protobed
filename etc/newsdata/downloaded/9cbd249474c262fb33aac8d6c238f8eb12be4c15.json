Facebook and Georgetown barred news organizations from filming. Instead organizers provided a livestream on Georgetown\u2019s social media site and made available video shot by Facebook.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite ironic,\u201d said Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute and a former state prosecutor. More generally, she said of Facebook, \u201cThe key to free expression is to not have one company control the flow of speech to more than 2 billion people, using algorithms that amplify disinformation in order to maximize profits.\u201d\n\nFacebook, Google, Twitter and other companies are trying to oversee internet content while also avoiding infringing on First Amendment rights. The pendulum has swung recently toward restricting hateful speech that could spawn violence. The shift follows mass shootings in which the suspects have posted racist screeds online or otherwise expressed hateful views or streamed images of attacks.\n\nFacebook also has come under criticism for not doing enough to filter out phony political ads.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re doing a very good job at getting everyone mad at us,\u201d Zuckerberg told the packed hall at Georgetown.\n\nHe said serious threats to expression are coming from places such as China, where social media platforms used by protesters are censored, and from court decisions restricting the location of internet users\u2019 data in certain countries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here today because I believe that we must continue to stand for free expression,\u201d he said. People of varied political beliefs are trying to define expansive speech as dangerous because it could bring results they don\u2019t accept, Zuckerberg said. \u201cI personally believe this is more dangerous to democracy in the long term than almost any speech.\u201d\n\nTaking note of mounting criticism of the market dominance of Facebook and other tech giants, Zuckerberg acknowledged the companies\u2019 centralized power but said it\u2019s also \u201cdecentralized by putting it directly into people\u2019s hands. \u2026 Giving people a voice and broader inclusion go hand in hand.\u201d\n\nJohn Stanton, a former fellow at Georgetown who heads a group called the \u201cSave Journalism Project,\u201d called the CEO\u2019s appearance \u201ca joke.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg \u201cis the antithesis of free expression,\u201d Stanton said in a statement. \u201cHe\u2019s thrown free speech, public education and democracy to the wayside in his thirst for power and profit.\u201d\n\nThe social media giant, with nearly 2.5 billion users around the globe, is under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators following a series of data privacy scandals, including lapses in opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign.\n\nFacebook and other social media platforms have drawn accusations from President Donald Trump and his allies that their platforms are steeped in anti-conservative bias.\n\nZuckerberg recently fell into a tiff with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, who ran a fake political ad on Facebook taking aim at the CEO. Warren has proposed breaking up big tech companies. With the phony ad, she was protesting Facebook\u2019s policy of not fact-checking politicians\u2019 speech or ads in the same way it enlists outside parties to fact-check news stories and other posts.\n\n\u201cWe think people should be able to see for themselves,\u201d Zuckerberg responded Thursday on the fact-checking issue. \u201cIf content is newsworthy, we don\u2019t take it down even if it goes against our standards.\u201d\n\nThe social media network also rebuffed requests that it remove a misleading video ad from Trump\u2019s re-election campaign targeting Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nA spokesman for Biden said Zuckerberg\u2019s speech was an effort \u201cto cloak Facebook\u2019s policy in a feigned concern for free expression.\u201d\n\n\u201cFacebook has chosen to sell Americans\u2019 personal data to politicians looking to target them with disproven lies and conspiracy theories, crowding out the voices of working Americans,\u201d campaign spokesman Bill Russo said in a statement.\n\nSeveral of the students\u2019 questions to Zuckerberg at Georgetown pointed up the conflict. One asked, if Facebook supports free speech, \u201cwhy is conservative content disproportionately censored?\u201d But another asserted that the policy of not fact-checking political ads is pro-conservative.\n\n\u201cI think it would be hard to be biased against both sides,\u201d Zuckerberg replied, smiling.\n\nAsked about the handling of questions, Facebook spokeswoman Ruchika Budhjara said, \u201cThey were submitted by students as they walked into the room. And they\u2019re being picked at random by Georgetown.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Technology Writer Barbara Ortutay in San Francisco contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday defended the social media platform's refusal to take down content it considers newsworthy \"even if it goes against our standards.\" But while he promoted free expression, limitations were place on coverage of his remarks at Georgetown University.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Marcy Gordon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/17/facebook_politics_18097_c0-171-4115-2571_s1200x700.jpg?9edda7c976e322eb421ca6ff91d02ed6aa38b808", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
