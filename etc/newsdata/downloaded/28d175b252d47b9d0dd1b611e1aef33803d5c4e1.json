The flight was meant to take about 25 minutes, but the plane was in the air for two hours.\"\n\nPrince William and Duchess Kate meet cancer patient Wafia Rehmani, 7, at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital in Lahore, Pakistan, on Oct. 17, 2019.

Pakistan is nine hours ahead of Eastern Time in the U.S.\n\nAside from that, it was a busy day for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in Lahore, where they visited an orphanage and a hospital, played some cricket at the National Cricket Academy (Pakistanis are mad for cricket), and visited the historic, 17th-century Mughal-era Badshahi Mosque, the most iconic Islamic site in Lahore's Old City, known as the Walled City.\n\nThey also visited the children's ward at the free Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital, founded by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan to honor his late mother, and visited by his friend and William's mother, the late Princess Diana, in 1996 and 1997.\n\nVideo posted online showed Will and Kate at the bedside of a young cancer patient, Muhammed Sameer.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited a children's cancer hospital in Lahore, Pakistan.

She said she once talked about how it takes a village to raise a child. \"The village we have seen here today is the best representation of that ideal that I could have possibly imagined.\" (Photo: Peter Nicholls/Pool/ Getty Images)\n\nKate wore two different outfits during the day. First up, she wore a white shalwar kameez (tunic embroidered with jasmine, the country's national flower, and matching pants) by Pakistani textile company Gul Ahmed and a matching shawl by Maheen Khan.\n\nShe changed from beige suede heels into canvas tennis shoes to show off her cricket skills on the field. The couple received cricket bats as gifts for their three children, Prince George, 6, Princess Charlotte, 4, and Prince Louis, 1, although the little one is smaller than the bat.\n\nPrince William and Duchess Kate walk in front of the impressive entrance of the Badshahi Mosque in Lahore, Pakistan, on Oct. 17, 2019.
