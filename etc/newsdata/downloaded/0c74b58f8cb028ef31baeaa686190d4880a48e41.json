It was obviously going to be a challenge for us.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019d played this tournament 12 months ago we would have been blown out of the water.\n\n\u201cWe have played four big games in a short period of time and I think it is commendable to the Russian players who stood up and played for their country as best they can and with pride.\u201d\n\nThe Russians were competitive in each of their four matches, but ran out of steam against Scotland, who controlled the ball and increased the tempo as they began to find space.\n\nThe fatigue was most evident in the second half when captain Vasily Artemyev put up a clearing kick that barely travelled 30 metres and only a few players trudged forward to stop the counter attack, which ended with another Scotland try.\n\n\u201cIt was always a difficult task, playing four games in a row,\u201d Artemyev said. \u201cWe pushed ourselves to our limits.\n\n\u201c(But) we have made a name for the Russian rugby team as a dedicated side and a tough nut to break.\u201d", "description": "Coping with the pace of tier one nations had been most evident for Russia's players at the World Cup, but the fact they had little more than 12 months to get ready for the tournament was a testament to the side, coach Lyn Jones said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438832747&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9814K", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
