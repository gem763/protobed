(Yes, literal games. The BLS survey found that we\u2019re nearly twice as likely to get our game on than non-millennials, and for a longer time \u2014 but then again, we\u2019re the \u201cWorld of Warcraft\u201d generation).\n\nHere\u2019s what really worries me: Few of these activities are as geared toward building deep relationships and communal support as the religious traditions the millennials are leaving behind. Actively participating in a congregation means embedding oneself in a community. This involves you in the lives of others and the other way around \u2014 their joys and sadnesses, connections and expectations. By leaving religion, we\u2019re shrugging off the ties that bind, not just loosening them temporarily.\n\nWhich is freeing, in some sense \u2014 \u201cFinally, no one\u2019s breathing down my neck about finding a spouse!\u201d \u2014 until it\u2019s not. Much of the conversation around millennials today does center on workload and debt, but it\u2019s our generation\u2019s complaints about relationship culture, family formation and a lack thereof that are likely to reach a crescendo in the coming years. Dating apps were exciting in 2012, but seven years later we\u2019re burnt out. A new wave of egg-freezing start-ups is targeting the growing number of millennial women who still haven\u2019t found the partner they hoped they would.", "description": "", "authors": ["Christine Emba", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Why-Millennials-Are-Skipping-Church-And-Not-Going-Back"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
