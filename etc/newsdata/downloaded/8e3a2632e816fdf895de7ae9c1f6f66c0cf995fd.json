But Galvin will miss 4-6 weeks with an unspecified lower body injury he suffered early in the first quarter.\n\nBrewer was evaluated after taking the hit and didn\u2019t return against K-State. While not elaborating, Rhule described that move as precautionary. The quarterback has thrown for 1,202 yards and 11 touchdowns with no interceptions this season.\n\nThe Bears (5-0, 2-0 Big 12), who have a seven-game winning streak and are ranked for the first time in two years, are home Saturday against Texas Tech (3-2, 1-1).\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show Galvin is a left tackle.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Baylor starting quarterback Charlie Brewer has been cleared to practice and play for the No. 22 Bears, who will be without starting left tackle Connor Galvin.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/baylor_kansas_st_football_63199_c0-119-2851-1781_s1770x1032.jpg?74e9c97f111dadc222223187dcab20626a965cfa", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
