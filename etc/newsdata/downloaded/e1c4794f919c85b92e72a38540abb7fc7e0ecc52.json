The last one was in April.\n\nMr S\u00e1nchez's socialist PSOE party gained the most seats in that election, but it fell short of a majority in Spain's 350-seat parliament.\n\nIn an evening press conference, Mr S\u00e1nchez blamed the opposition for the political deadlock.\n\n\"It has been impossible to complete the mandate given to us by the Spanish people on April 28. They [the rival parties] have made it impossible for us,\" he said.\n\nThe acting PM had been seeking to find a political solution for several months.\n\nHis preferred partners, the left-wing Podemos party, had already rejected any arrangement short of a formal coalition.\n\nA potential alliance between PSOE and the Catalan party, Ciudadanos, also fell through.\n\nEl Pa\u00eds newspaper reported that attempts to reach a deal went up until the last minute.\n\nAfter the announcement, Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias blamed Mr S\u00e1nchez for the impasse, saying he had \"arrogance and disdain for the basic rules of parliamentary democracy\".", "description": "Acting Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez announces November poll, after failing to win rivals' support.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/110DE/production/_108845896_gettyimages-1157645463.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
