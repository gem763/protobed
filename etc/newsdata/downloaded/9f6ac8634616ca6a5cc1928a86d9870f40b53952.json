ESPN's Adam Schefter reported the deal could be worth up to $15 million and contains a $9 million signing bonus.\n\nThe Patriots will be Brown's third team this year. He was traded from the Pittsburgh Steelers to the Raiders in March.\n\nBrown reacted to the move on Twitter:\n\nBrown's tenure with the Raiders turned into a massive failure in a short amount of time. The 31-year-old missed the start of training camp because of frostbite caused by wearing the wrong footwear in a cryotherapy machine.\n\nBrown also filed two different grievances with the NFL\u2014which he lost\u2014over the type of helmet he wanted to wear during games.\n\nOn Wednesday, Brown used social media to post and respond to a letter he received from Raiders general manager Mike Mayock informing him of nearly $54,000 in fines in relation to a missed practice and walkthrough.\n\nSchefter reported Thursday the team was planning to suspend Brown following an altercation with Mayock.\n\nBut Raiders head coach Jon Gruden told reporters Friday that Brown would play in Week 1 against the Denver Broncos. Oakland also fined the four-time All-Pro for conduct detrimental to the team, which voided the guaranteed money in his contract and prompted him to ask for his release.\n\nBrown wrote in an email to ESPN's Jeff Darlington that he was not going to play \"after they took [away my guarantees] and made my contract week-to-week.\"\n\nThe Raiders granted Brown's wish by releasing him.\n\nBrown is one of the most productive players in the NFL. He's had at least 100 receptions, 1,200 receiving yards and eight touchdowns in each of the past six seasons.\n\nThe Patriots are one of the few teams that makes sense as a landing spot for Brown. They've got a history of helping star players rehab their images while also reaping the benefits of their talents on the field.\n\nTheir strong infrastructure, starting with head coach Bill Belichick, allows them to take bold risks. They've also shown in the past how quickly they will move on from a player if they feel he isn't fitting in with their system.\n\nBrown and Tom Brady could make for a lethal pairing, especially as the Patriots explore ways to replace Rob Gronkowski's production. If Brown doesn't cause any problems, a receiver tandem of him and Josh Gordon will be scary for opposing defenses.", "description": "Antonio Brown 's long, strange journey will soon take him to a new home after he signed with the  New England Patriots  following his release from the  Oakland Raiders  on Saturday...", "authors": ["Adam Wells"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/827/010/hi-res-d047b49e8eee99b4d2efff5fcf4e9bd5_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
