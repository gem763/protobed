If they waver, that will signal that Trump\u2019s days are numbered. Of course, the rub is that neither have spoken out against Trump \u2014 in fact, they\u2019ve stuck by him \u2014 but that\u2019s the point. If Republicans do abandon Trump over impeachment, it will be because of the senators least likely to strike out against Trump balked.\n\nEach new development potentially changes the calculus, too. For instance, last Tuesday, the Senate unanimously passed a nonbinding resolution calling on the Trump administration to release the whistleblower complaint that alleged the president had tried to coerce the Ukranian president to investigate Democratic front-runner and former Vice President Joe Biden. The resolution signaled a surprising bipartisan willingness to let more information out. But by Thursday, after the whistleblower\u2019s complaint went public, most Republicans had already rallied around talking points that questioned the motivations and veracity of the whistleblower, instead of criticizing Trump. The short-lived moment for a cascade passed almost as quickly as it had come.\n\nBut if you\u2019re looking for another moment when Republicans might break with Trump, look for an event like last Tuesday. Moments like that can create uncertainty and situations where the ground can shift quickly. For most congressional Republicans, this is no doubt a frustrating state of affairs. Few presumably relish defending Trump against the increasingly indefensible. But this is where the party is currently stuck.", "description": "", "authors": ["Lee Drutman", "Fivethirtyeight.Com Features If-Republicans-Ever-Turn-On-Trump-Itll-Happen-All-At-Once", "Ex_Cid Story-Twitter"], "top_image": ""}
