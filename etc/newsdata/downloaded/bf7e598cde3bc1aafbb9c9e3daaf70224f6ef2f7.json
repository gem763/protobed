(Mike Blake/Reuters)\n\nThe Trump administration is pushing ahead with a plan we endorsed previously. It will revoke California\u2019s ability to set separate greenhouse-gas standards for cars \u2014 so that a single policy will apply to the entire country, and so that California can\u2019t use the threat of a bifurcated regulatory regime to influence that policy in a way other states cannot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe are fans of federalism. But Congress, understandably not wanting automakers to have to comply with 50 different sets of regulations, has generally preempted state regulation in this area \u2014 with the exception that California, and California alone, may apply for a waiver to create its own emission rules to address \u201ccompelling and extraordinary conditions.\u201d Other states may then adopt these rules if they choose.\n\n\u201cCompelling and extraordinary conditions\u201d was intended as a reference to smog. And in contrast to Californian smog, there is nothing compelling and extraordinary about Californian climate change. Climate change is happening to the rest of the country (and indeed the world) too, and climate change is what the state\u2019s greenhouse-gas rules \u2014 as opposed to policies regulating other emissions \u2014 address. Thus the legal basis for the waiver does not apply here.\n\nFurther, under the Obama administration, California leveraged the car industry\u2019s desire for a single regulatory regime into an agreement with the federal government, under which the nationwide regulations would reflect California\u2019s priorities. As a result, car buyers nationwide had to pay extra for vehicles meeting the state\u2019s preferences. No single state should have such power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe waiver needs to go. And the Trump administration should continue with the other element of its plan too: nixing Obama-era rules that required fuel economy to hit nearly 55 miles per gallon on average by 2025, a far-fetched goal that could force car companies to sell electric vehicles at a loss to bring down the average fuel economy of their overall fleets. Freezing the standards after next year, as the administration plans to do, could reduce the future price of a car by thousands of dollars \u2014 and also reduce motor-vehicle fatalities, because one way carmakers increase fuel efficiency is to make cars lighter and more dangerous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that nothing in either policy change stops companies from making more fuel-efficient cars if Americans want to buy them. In fact, several carmakers have already struck a deal with California to follow the state\u2019s higher standards whether or not the waiver continues. The Trump administration questions the legality of the pact, but the agreement will help these companies appeal to customers who are willing to pay for fuel economy, and also reduce the stakes of any future court battle over the waiver.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s fine for car companies to go above and beyond what\u2019s legally required of them.
