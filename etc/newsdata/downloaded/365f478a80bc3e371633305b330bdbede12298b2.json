You get up there and do a silly dance,\u201d Culkin wrote in the caption of a clip of his performance on social media.\n\nAfter Culkin finished dancing, Lizzo poked fun at his \u201cHome Alone\u201d role by recreating his character Kevin McCallister\u2019s shocked expression from the film, much to the audience\u2019s delight.\n\nCulkin, who famously loathes revisiting the role, played it off well. Lizzo then pulled him in for an embrace and asked the crowd to give the actor his due.\n\nDuring a rare interview in 2018, the famously press-averse Culkin sat down with Ellen DeGeneres and revealed he won\u2019t he watch the classic Christmas film anymore and even tries to avoid being in public over the holidays.\n\nAnd when strangers ask him to do \u201cthe face,\u201d Culkin said he tends to shoot them down.\n\n\u201cNo. Been there, done that already. I\u2019m 37 now, OK? OK,\u201d he told DeGeneres about fan requests.\n\nBut maybe he\u2019d make an exception for his new BFF Lizzo.", "description": "The singer even made the classic \"Home Alone\" face in front of the former child star.", "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daf410e210000a521ad395d.png?cache=nxr7qbfhho&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
