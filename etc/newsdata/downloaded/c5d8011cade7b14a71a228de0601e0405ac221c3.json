BMI in a healthy range is between 18.5 and 24.9.\n\nWHAT IS ASTHMA? Asthma is a common but incurable condition which affects the small tubes inside the lungs. It can cause them to become inflamed, or swollen, which restricts the airways and makes it harder to breathe. The condition affects people of all ages and often starts in childhood. Symptoms may improve or even go away as children grow older, but can return in adulthood. Symptoms include wheezing, breathlessness, a tight chest and coughing, and these may get worse during an asthma attack. Treatment usually involves medication which is inhaled to calm down the lungs. Triggers for the condition include allergies, dust, air pollution, exercise and infections such as cold or flu. If you think you or your child has asthma you should visit a doctor, because it can develop into more serious complications like fatigue or lung infections.

It can cause them to become inflamed, or swollen, which restricts the airways and makes it harder to breathe.\n\nA total of 5.4million people in the UK are affected, and 25million in the US.", "description": "A study from\u00a0Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital and the University of Western Australia has found that fatty adipose tissue clogs up the airway walls and restricts the supply of oxygen.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/17/19793248-0-image-a-4_1571329828028.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
