I wanted to show the raw, the messy, the unflaterring. This is a woman holding it together.\"\n\nThe series sees Alex, as a journalist, deemed to be past her prime by sexist male colleagues.\n\nJen continued: \"One of the challenges for [my] character is the trauma and turmoil going on in her private life, and the toll that takes on her emotionally, physically, mentally, versus the character that she is when she has to get up, put on a face and smile to America.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nJen's candid honesty comes hot on the heels of a big move on her part - she's joined Instagram .\n\nAs if this wasn't enough for fans to go wild over, she marked the occasion with an Internet-breaking snap.\n\nJoining her for a selfie were her Friends co-stars Courtney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\nThe blond beauty, 50, wrote: \"And now we're Instagram FRIENDS too. HI INSTAGRAM.\"\n\nFans have been going wild for the snap, as many have been clamouring for a reunion since the show ended back in 2004.\n\nShe's had some high-profile relationships in the past, and has often been in the public eye because of it.\n\nHer two marriages, to Brad Pitt and Justin Theroux, both ended in separation - and this helped her relate to the character of Alex.\n\nJen told The Daily Telegraph : \"Of course there are times when you don't want anyone to see you, or you don't want to be photographed or even go out of the house.\n\n\"Nothing is as it seems in a glossy magazine.\"", "description": "Jennifer revealed her excitement at playing such a human, down-to-earth character that she could relate to", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Apple", "Getty Images", "Instagram", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14185146.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-181518.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
