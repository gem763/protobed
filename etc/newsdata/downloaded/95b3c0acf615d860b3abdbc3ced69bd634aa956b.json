The inside is dominated by the holy symbol of the peacock.\n\nAt the altar, they pray and tie knots in pieces of cloth that represent their wishes. Outside, a stall sells souvenirs in the shape of peacocks.\n\nTheir beliefs and practices of the Yazidis include a ban on eating lettuce and wearing the colour blue.\n\nBut their unique beliefs -- which over time have integrated elements of Judaism, Christianity and Islam -- have often been misconstrued as satanic.\n\nSome Muslims consider the Peacock Angel revered by Yazidis a demon figure and refer to Yazidis as devil-worshippers.\n\nOne tradition in the Yazidi religion is to tie knots in pieces of cloth, representing their wishes\n\nAnd while the 35,000 Yazidi community in Armenia can freely practise their religion, elsewhere they have suffered greatly.\n\nYazidis also live in Syria, Turkey -- and Iraq, which has the largest community, numbering 1.5 million.\n\nAfter years of persecution by the former dictator Saddam Hussein, in 2014 they faced the brutality of the Islamic State group.\n\nThe jihadists seized their bastion Sinjar in northwestern Iraq, killing thousands of Yazidis then abducting and enslaving women and girls.\n\nThey suffered crimes that the United Nations has described as genocide and Armenia's parliament has formally recognised as genocide.\n\nLast year, Yazidi activist Nadia Murad, who was held prisoner by IS, was joint winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for her activism against sexual violence.", "description": "Yazidis, an ancient ethnic group much persecuted for their faith, now have a massive new temple in Armenia to help preserve their religion and identity.The...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/13/wire-19990650-1571662378-60_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
