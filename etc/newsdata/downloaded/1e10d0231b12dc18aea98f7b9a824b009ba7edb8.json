Add The Note as an interest to stay up to date on the latest The Note news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nIf President Donald Trump wants a focus on the facts of the case rather than the process, he\u2019s about to get his wish.\n\nSo will Democrats who are making the case for impeachment, who get a double-dose of substance and potential momentum on Tuesday.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi is set to outline the procedural steps from here. That points toward a House vote later this week to authorize public hearings on impeachment -- an answer to Republican challenges that Democrats put votes behind their efforts.\n\nPablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\n\nBehind closed doors, meanwhile, comes a new twist. A member of the National Security Council -- a current White House official, testifying against the wishes of his bosses -- will say that he listened to the infamous call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, and was concerned that it could set in motion events that \"would all undermine U.S. national security.\"\n\n\"I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen,\" Lt. Col Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council's Director of European Affairs, will tell House impeachment investigators on Tuesday, according to prepared testimony obtained by ABC News.\n\nThis is the kind of testimony Democrats see moving public opinion when -- and if -- impeachment hearings go public. It comes from the kind of witness that will be harder for Republicans to tear down as momentum builds.\n\nThe RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks\n\nTrump may hope the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi will put an end to the political backlash surrounding his decision to hurriedly pull U.S. troops from Syria, but tough questions regarding Turkey\u2019s actions in the region and the fate of the Kurdish population remain.\n\nTasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n\nOn Tuesday, the House of Representatives is expected to both debate and vote on a bipartisan bill, which, if passed by Congress and signed into law, would call on the U.S. government to again impose sanctions against top-tier Turkish officials involved in the country\u2019s invasion of northern Syria.\n\n\"Being a NATO member means that Turkey is treaty bound to safeguard the principles of democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of law, and importantly, should be united with other NATO allies in efforts for collective defense and the preservation of peace and security,\" the legislation currently reads.\n\nThe bill calls Turkey\u2019s military invasion \"unacceptable\" and demands Turkey retreat.\n\nThe move in the House comes a week after a short pause in fighting which had led the president to lift the temporary sanctions that his administration had previously put in place. A bipartisan group of senators has also pushed for sanctions in recent days.\n\nMoreover, congressional investigators will likely continue to dig-in on the role former Kurdish allies may have played in providing information to the U.S. on al-Baghdadi\u2019s location.\n\nThe TIP with Zohreen Shah\n\nOne of the presidential candidates who has joined the call to fight climate change, is now fleeing its effects.\n\n\"We\u2019re evacuated. We\u2019re evacuated,\" Sen. Kamala Harris told a room full of reporters on Monday, thousands of miles away from her Brentwood, California, home.\n\nEtienne Laurent/EPA via Shutterstock\n\nHarris frequently speaks about visiting parts of California where fires have ravaged neighborhoods -- and even leveled one town -- but this is one of the first times she has spoken about her own home being affected by the very climate change force she frequently speaks about.\n\n\"If we do not act in the next 12 years, it will be to our collective detriment, it's a large part of my focus is on what we need to do to save this God-given planet,\" Harris said recently.\n\nONE MORE THING\n\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council's director of European Affairs who listened to President Donald Trump's July call with the Ukrainian president, was \"concerned\" by Trump's comments in the conversation and reported his concerns to a White House lawyer, according to a copy of his opening remarks to House impeachment investigators, obtained by ABC News.
