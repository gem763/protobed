Every time Kavanaugh left his house, viewers watched him, on live TV, hop into a dark SUV and speed to Capitol Hill or elsewhere. News crews chased Cohen up and down Manhattan\u2019s Park Avenue. Madoff barely could traverse his Upper East Side sidewalk, for all the cameras and microphones clogging his path. Weiner once was caught en route to the dry cleaners near Union Square, generating sassy headlines about Weiner\u2019s dirty laundry.\n\nSEN. THOM TILLIS: DEMS' STRATEGY OF PERSONAL DESTRUCTION AGAINST TRUMP BEGAN WITH BRETT KAVANAUGH\n\nHunter Biden has endured none of this.\n\nWhere are the lenses pointed into his living room? Why don\u2019t we see him going out to dinner, walking his dog, collecting his mail, and so on?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIs there a double standard here? Or have the American media strayed so far from basic newsgathering that they simply cannot find Hunter\u2019s house?\n\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to prove a negative, the Media Research Center\u2019s Brent Baker knows what he\u2019s missed regarding Hunter Biden. \u201cI\u2019ve seen no evidence of anything even stakeout-adjacent,\u201d Baker tells me. He adds that, even though this has been the No. 1 story for the past fortnight, images of Biden the younger have been limited to \u201clots of file photos and brief video clips of him next to his dad in years past.\u201d\n\nAnd why would the former vice president\u2019s son be spared the unsurpassed company of camera- and microphone-wielding news people?\n\n\u201cJournalists don\u2019t consider the Hunter Biden story anything more than a distraction by President Trump to obfuscate his misdeeds,\u201d Baker explains. \u201cSo why would they devote resources to stakeout duties that would convey relevance to a topic they consider irrelevant?\u201d\n\nHave the Big Media found a brand-new respect for the privacy of newsmakers? There is no evidence of that, either.\n\nBy all means, people in the headlines should enjoy personal peace and quiet. When Hunter Biden goes to a TV studio or hotel ballroom to make a statement \u2014 for which America eagerly awaits \u2014 the media should cover that. Otherwise, leave him alone.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nHowever, this is not the news industry\u2019s new standard. Not even close.\n\nSo, in short: Where is Hunter Biden, and why aren\u2019t the media in his driveway looking for him?\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DEROY MURDOCK", "description": "Where is Hunter Biden, and why aren\u2019t the media in his driveway looking for him?", "authors": ["Deroy Murdock"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/joe-biden-hunter-biden-china-Reuters.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
