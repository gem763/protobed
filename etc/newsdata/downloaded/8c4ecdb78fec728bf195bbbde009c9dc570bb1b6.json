They started due to a proposal to extradite criminal suspects to Mainland China, something the protesters fear might damage the city\u2019s judicial sovereignty.\n\nMorey\u2019s tweet led to tension between the NBA and China during recent exhibition games held in that country. The NBA and China have a lot of business deals, some of which might be in jeopardy on the heels of Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\nIrving feels NBA players should focus on fixing issues in the United States.\n\n\u201cI understand Hong Kong and China is dealing with their issues, respectively,\u201d Irving said. \u201cBut there\u2019s enough oppression going on in America for me not to be involved in the community issues here as well. That\u2019s one of those four pillars that goes in terms of the black community, colored people here still in America: We\u2019re fighting for everyday freedoms.\n\n\u201cI stand for four [pillars]: inner peace, freedom, equality and world peace, man.\u201d\n\nIrving didn\u2019t specify what \u201coppression going on in America\u201d he was referring to, or which \u201ceveryday freedoms\u201d are being denied.\n\nThe Nets are owned by Taiwanese-born billionaire Joe Tsai, who has business dealings with the Chinese government, and recently stated, \u201c1.4 billion Chinese citizens stand united when it comes to the territorial integrity of China and the country\u2019s sovereignty over her homeland. This issue is non-negotiable.\u201d\n\nHong Kong was a British colony until 1997 when it became part of China. While Hong Kong is part of China, they have more autonomy than other parts of the country, but many residents fear that changing, and this has contributed to some of the protests.\n\nThe protests spread to a Nets preseason game on Friday at the Barclay Center in Brooklyn, with some fans wearing shirts reading \u201cStand with Hong Kong,\u201d and chanting of \u201cShame on Joe Tsai!\u201d There were also signs on display reading \u201cMorey or Money?\u201d A number of the protesters wore masks to protect their identities from the Chinese government.\n\nWhat did Irving think of these protests at the Nets\u2019 game?\n\n\u201cWhen I think about Hong Kong and China, the people are in an uproar,\u201d Irving said. \u201cAnd for us as Americans to comment on it, African Americans or American Indians to comment on that, you\u2019re connected nonetheless, especially when it impacts freedoms or world peace. So for me as an individual I stand up for those four pillars. And when they\u2019re being conflicted I can understand why protestors come to the games.\u201d", "description": "Brooklyn Nets player Kyrie Irving feels there's \"enough oppression going on in America\" that needs to be focused on, when asked about", "authors": ["Daniel Leberfeld"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Getty-Images_Adam-Glanzman-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
