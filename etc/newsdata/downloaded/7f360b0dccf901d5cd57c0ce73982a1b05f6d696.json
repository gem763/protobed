University of Sydney had the highest full-time employment over the medium term, with 93.2 per cent (stock)\n\nHe said Australia's economic success relies of educated workers who have access to research and innovation.\n\n'Our Government has put graduate employment outcomes at the centre of our performance-based funding model for universities. This means universities will be incentivised to continue to produce job-ready graduates,' he said.\n\nLabor frontbencher Bill Shorten said the coalition had nothing to boast about, arguing it was more expensive to go to universities than ever.\n\n'I give the young people the credit for those results - they're the ones studying hard,' he told reporters in Melbourne on Sunday.\n\n'I just wish the federal government would work as hard as them. It's too expensive, too many cuts to university and too many people are missing out.\n\nFederal Education Minister Dan Tehan said universities would continue to be given incentives to make graduates job-ready. Engineering is another degree with high employment (stock)", "description": "Dentistry produces the most employable graduates, with 99 per cent of graduates in full-time employment three years after completing their studies.", "authors": ["Claudia Poposki For Daily Mail Australia", "Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/00/19375848-0-image-a-10_1570406365570.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
