Parker remained.\n\nThis summer, when several current and former female Nike-sponsored runners came forward to say they had forced to decide whether to risk financial penalties from Nike by becoming pregnant, the company simply changed its policy. Parker again stayed in charge.\n\nBut the crisis currently hitting Nike strikes much closer to home for Parker.\n\nAccording to emails contained in a decision by the American Arbitration Association in a case between U.S. Anti-Doping Agency and the Nike-backed running coach Alberto Salazar, Parker and other top Nike officials were briefed on several occasions between 2009 and 2011 regarding medical experiments being conducted to determine the effects of performance-enhancing drugs and how much of the substances could be used by athletes without being detected.", "description": "Email to and from Mark Parker, the company\u2019s top executive, show he was briefed on experiments that involved performance-enhancing drugs.", "authors": ["Julie Creswell"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/01/sports/01salazar-nike-1/01salazar-nike-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
