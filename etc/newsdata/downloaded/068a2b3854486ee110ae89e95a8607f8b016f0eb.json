A surprising twist emerges \u2013 President Trump instructed Perry to \u201cvisit with Rudy\u201d about concerns the two had about corruption in Ukraine. During that \u201cvisit with Rudy\u201d, Perry was given three reasons why he and Trump were concerned about Ukraine\u2019s commitment to fighting corruption.\n\n\u201cAnd as I recall the conversation, he said, \u2018Look, the president is really concerned that there are people in Ukraine that tried to beat him during this presidential election,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Perry said. \u201c \u2018He thinks they\u2019re corrupt and\u2026that there are still people over there engaged that are absolutely corrupt.\u2019 \u201d Mr. Perry said the president\u2019s lawyer didn\u2019t make any explicit demands on the call. \u201cRudy didn\u2019t say they gotta do X, Y and Z,\u201d Mr. Perry said. \u201cHe just said, \u2018You want to know why he ain\u2019t comfortable about letting this guy come in? Here\u2019s the reason.\u2019 \u201d In the phone call, Mr. Giuliani blamed Ukraine for the dossier about Mr. Trump\u2019s alleged ties to Russia that was created by a former British intelligence officer, Mr. Perry said, and asserted that Ukraine had Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email server and \u201cdreamed up\u201d evidence that helped send former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to jail. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether that was crap or what,\u201d Mr. Perry added, \u201cbut I\u2019m just saying there were three things that he said. That\u2019s the reason the president doesn\u2019t trust these guys.\u201d\n\nUkrainian corruption isn\u2019t breaking news. The belief that Hillary\u2019s email server is in Ukraine is a different thing. Rudy and Trump believe that CrowdStrike is mixed up in the DNC hack during the 2016 election. The Ukrainian government hasn\u2019t been proven to be involved with the DNC hack, though Russia has. Trump\u2019s request for Zelensky to look into potential illegal meddling during the 2016 election at the hands of Joe Biden is how the current impeachment inquiry hearings began.\n\nPerry said that Giuliani didn\u2019t make any demands of him. And, he is steering clear of any validation of Rudy\u2019s concerns. Perry finds himself involved in the Congressional investigations. Trump blamed his phone call with Zelensky on Perry. And, when it looked like Trump was throwing Perry under the bus, rumors circulated that Perry has one foot out of the door. Perry said he will cooperate with Congress.\n\nSo, Perry is shedding some light on why President Trump doesn\u2019t trust the efforts of Ukraine to make reforms necessary to combat longtime corruption concerns. Rudy Giuliani looks to be the source of Trump\u2019s information on the ground. Rudy is running a shadow diplomacy operation.\n\nAs I have written about in previous posts, Rick Perry\u2019s mission is to develop relationships in Ukraine and make mutually beneficial energy deals. It is important for countries that are dependent on Russia as a source of energy to have alternatives, preferably an American alternative. Perry was urging President Trump to develop his own relationship with the new Ukrainian president, who has expressed a desire to make the reforms necessary in his country. Trump, with Rudy in his ear, hesitated to meet with Zelensky until he was more certain that Zelensky was doing all he could.\n\nMeanwhile, Perry is still on the job and expects to be there, at least through Thanksgiving.\n\nMr. Perry again disputed recent reports that have claimed he was planning to leave the administration, but he did leave the door open to his departure. He said he expects to be at the Energy Department at Thanksgiving, but gave a less definitive answer when asked about staying beyond that, through year\u2019s end. \u201dI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m working at the will of the president, just like I always have.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll see if he makes it to year\u2019s end.\n\n.", "description": "\"Visit with Rudy\"", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Perry-7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
