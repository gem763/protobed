The 49ers now lead the NFC West with eight wins out of eight.\n\n\u2013 Brees-y does it \u2013\n\nElsewhere Sunday, New Orleans quarterback Brees showed no sign of the injury that sidelined him for five weeks in a 31-9 defeat of the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nBrees, who suffered a torn thumb ligament in week two, threw for three touchdowns and 373 yards to fire the Saints at their home Superdome.\n\nThe Saints improved to 7-1 with the win, cementing their place at the top of the NFC South.\n\n\u201cIt felt really good,\u201d the 40-year-old Brees said afterwards.\n\n\u201cThe last five weeks have been tough. I had a lot of excitement early on today, just shaking rust off.\n\n\u201cI love the game and love to be able to be out there with my team-mates \u2026 that was my motivation to get back out there.\u201d\n\nZane Gonzalez had given the Cardinals an early lead with a 50-yard field goal in the first quarter as Brees and the Saints offense started slowly.\n\nBut New Orleans levelled with a 58-yard field goal of their own from Wil Lutz before scoring their first touchdown after an eight-yard rush from Latavius Murray into the end zone.\n\nBrees connected with Murray in the third quarter to stretch the Saints\u2019 lead to 17-6 after the Cardinals had turned over possession deep in their own territory after failing to convert a fourth down chance.\n\nAlthough Gonzalez bagged his third field goal to reduce the deficit, New Orleans responded swiftly with Brees leading a five-play 75-yard drive before connecting with Taysom Hill on a short pass to make it 24-9.\n\nA fourth quarter drive that ended with Brees picking out receiver Michael Thomas for nine yards completed the scoring.\n\n\u2013 Seahawks, Rams win \u2013\n\nIn other games on Sunday, Russell Wilson and the Seattle Seahawks were given a scare en route to a 27-20 road win over the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nThe Seahawks, who improved to 6-2 with the victory, had looked to be in complete control after taking a 24-0 second quarter lead against a Falcons side who are bottom of the NFC South with a 1-7 record.\n\nHowever the Falcons hit back with touchdowns from running back Brian Hill and tight end Austin Hooper before a late field goal from Matt Bryant made it 27-20 with 1min 24sec remaining.\n\nAtlanta\u2019s attempted onside kick however ended in failure and Wilson was able to run down the clock to close out the win.\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s London fixture, last year\u2019s beaten Super Bowl contenders the Los Angeles Rams bagged a second straight road victory with a 24-10 defeat of the winless Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nQuarterback Jared Goff threw for 372 yards from 17-of-31 attempts with two touchdowns, the highlight a 65-yard touchdown after a flea-flicker trick play to Cooper Kupp.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 The New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers extended their unbeaten starts to the season on Sunday as Drew Brees made a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/6e22f4_new-england-patriots-receiver-julian-edelman-celebrates-quarterback-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
