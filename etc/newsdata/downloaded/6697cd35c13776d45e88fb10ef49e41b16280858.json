His mission on Tuesday was to prosecute the case that investment against the ever-evolving slate of challenges to social licence was, above all, \u201cgood business\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe believe we must move from \u2018social licence\u2019 to \u2018social value\u2019; Or from \u2018tolerance and acceptance\u2019 to \u2018trust and partnership\u2019,\u201d Healy said.\n\n\u201cWe know this will be a challenging evolution. Today, I am going to explain why this transition \u2013 from licence to value \u2013 underpins our strategy.\n\nA disorderly transition to decarbonisation has the potential to threaten the viability of entire commodities in our product suite. \u2014 Geoff Healy, chief external affairs officer BHP\n\n\u201cAnd it is on this point that I want to be very clear. For us, it is \u2013 plain and simple \u2013 good business,\u201d he said.\n\nThe BHP logic is that demonstrating a sector-leading wealth of social value opens access to the best resources, markets, talent pools, commercial partners and the richest, most secure capital markets.\n\nBHP is a very large company that draws its financial power from comparatively few, very large, long-term assets that are \u201cstructurally immobile\u201d, Healy observed before noting that any level of \u201cimbalance\u201d in community relations carried the potential of fundamental effect on BHP and its owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHealy described just how intimate BHP\u2019s world really is, noting about 80 per cent of its EBITDA is harvested from just three regions: Western Australia, Queensland and the northern Atacama desert of Chile.\n\n\u201cOur portfolio is simple, yet the inherent risks are complex and wide-ranging,\u201d he said.\n\nThose risks start with the sorts of things we have seen in Australia often enough over the past three decades, things like attempts to retrospectively reset fiscal arrangements or to refuse approvals for projects new and old.\n\nAt their peak though, the risks triggered by a collapse of social value are \u201cexistential\u201d, Healy proposed.\n\n\u201cA disorderly transition to decarbonisation has the potential to threaten the viability of entire commodities in our product suite.\n\n\u201cAnd a social and environmental disaster, such as another significant tailings dam failure, has the potential to be existential.\n\n\u201cBut on the flipside, we know that if we manage well our transition \u2013 from \u2018licence to value\u2019 \u2013 we will create a core competitive advantage that will be very hard to replicate,\u201d he said.\n\nSpark's darkest fears\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpark Infrastructure\u2019s darkest fears about the price it will be able to charge for access to its electricity network have played out pretty much as chief executive Rick Francis predicted in August.\n\nBack then the Spark boss predicted something akin to an investment strike given the likelihood that new rate of return guidance from the Australian Energy Regulator would play out in the regulator\u2019s extant access pricing rulings.\n\nThe Francis threat, which arrived as an immediate and wry postscript to the Treasurer\u2019s call for Australian business to open their wallets and start investing again in the economy, was based on Spark\u2019s modelling of new rate of return guidance from the energy market regulator.\n\nFrancis said that when Spark ran its numbers through the new AER model it generated a rate of return ceiling of around 4.6 per cent. \u201cI would get laughed out of the room if I went to my owners and offered that as a proposition,\u201d Francis told The Australian Financial Review.\n\nOn Tuesday the AER delivered draft advice on the regulated return Spark can extract from its SA Power Networks business through the years 2020-2025. Spark can extract $3.905 billion over that five-year stretch. That is $309 million less than the $4.214 billion that Spark figured was needed.\n\nSpark responded to the draft ruling by signalling an intent to fully test the AER\u2019s draft ruling and repeating, in rather more diplomatic and formal terms, the intent of Francis\u2019 August complaint.\n\n\u201cSpark Infrastructure reiterates its view that the rate of return is not adequate to provide both a competitive and predictable return to long-term owners of network assets as required under the National Electricity and Gas objectives.\n\n\u201cThis puts at risk efficient investment in energy network assets, to the long-term detriment of consumers,\u201d Spark said in a statement released through the ASX platform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is disappointing that the AER has not acted on the clear message it has received from the investment community in relation to the market\u2019s rate of return expectations. In our view, the rate of return is insufficient to ensure the long-term sustainability and reliability of Australia\u2019s electricity infrastructure.\n\n\"This jeopardises achievement of Australia\u2019s environment and energy policy objectives. Our country needs critical investment in networks to facilitate the economy\u2019s efficient transition to a renewable future, and the integration of distributed energy resources enabling consumer choice and delivering the lowest-cost system,\u201d Francis said on Tuesday.\n\nTo give you an idea of the risk Spark was talking about, consider again what Francis told us back in August.\n\n\u201cCurrently, what we have here in front of us is the first major build out of the transmission network in decades and there is inherent risk associated with those greenfields construction projects like, say, a $1.5 billion investment in linking South Australia to the NSW grid,\" Francis warned in August.\n\nSpark sits either side of the interconnector proposal given it operates both the SA and NSW networks.\n\nThe other part of the network investment story is that the gathering roll-out of renewable generation demands a network that reaches further and is more flexible at every level of its operation.\n\nThe AER\u2019s draft ruling, which will now endure a review period that will result in a final decision by 30 April next year, allows for a weighted average cost of capital of 4.95 per cent.\n\nThat WACC is a little bit higher than the Spark modelling might have anticipated but it is a significant retreat from the 6.17 per cent allowed for in the 2015-20 ruling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis decrease is driven by changes we made to our regulatory tax approach and the 2018 rate of return instrument,\u201d the AER advised on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe biggest contributor to the difference between our draft decision and SA Network\u2019s proposal is the current rate of return (and therefore the rate of return on capital),\u201d the regulator continued.\n\n\u201cWhilst SA Power Networks applied the 2018 rate of return instrument and proposed a 5.43 per cent rate of return, currently the risk-free rate and cost of debt is lower than at the time of its proposal, leading to a rate of return of 4.95 per cent.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the revenue for the cost of capital component is lower by $233 million compared to the SA Power Network\u2019s proposal,\u201d the AER said.\n\nThe AER estimated lower network returns will trim $20 annually from the average SA consumer\u2019s power bill and $90 annually for small business customers.\n\nAnd that will be good as long as the system remains secure enough for the lights to stay on.", "description": "Australia's resources champion says \u201ca disorderly\" transition to a low-carbon world has the potential to threaten the viability of entire commodities in its product suite.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/29b38e47e316866b66712b9519abc830f4ca8ddd", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
