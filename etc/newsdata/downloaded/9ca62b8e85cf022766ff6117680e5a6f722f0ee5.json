REUTERS/Stringer\n\nAlibaba, which is looking for new revenue drivers as the e-commerce market at home matures, will also invest $700 million for a minority stake in Netease\u2019s music streaming arm as it takes on Chinese market leader Tencent Music.\n\nThe long-rumored Kaola deal and the music investment highlight at once a defensive move to keep niche growth players out of the hands of e-commerce rivals such as Pinduoduo and Alibaba\u2019s flexibility in adopting new strategies.\n\nKaola, launched by NetEase in 2015, aggressively targets shoppers in China by offering products from top brands such as Gucci, Shisheido and Burberry, primarily sourcing goods directly from suppliers to resell to consumers.\n\nIts more curated product line up based on popularity ensures it a loyal consumer base of shoppers, whereas Alibaba\u2019s Tmall allows a larger range of overseas brands to launch and manage virtual storefronts on its platform, said Ker Zheng, who tracks China\u2019s online retail sector at consultancy Azoya.\n\n\u201cKaola does not have to share user time or basket space with cheaper, non-imported products,\u201d said Zheng.\n\nKaola and Yanxuan, another NetEase-run line of private-label, company-branded goods, accounted for nearly half the gaming company\u2019s revenue in the June quarter.\n\nNetEase does not break down sales from Kaola.\n\nPLAYING DEFENCE\n\nThe Kaola deal will boost Alibaba\u2019s access to wealthy Chinese buyers, who account for more than a third of the luxury goods sector\u2019s worldwide revenues, as online sales slow at home.\n\nOnline retail sales in China grew 17.8% in the first half of 2019, versus 32.4% a year earlier, government data shows.\n\nThe acquisition will also help the tech giant face rising competition from rivals such as Pinduoduo.\n\nIn response to competition from Pinduoduo, that offers group-buying deals on household goods, Alibaba has already revamped Juhuasuan, its group-buying service.\n\nIt also launched Taobao Xinxuan, a line of private-label, house-brand goods.\n\n\u201cPinduoduo has a will to move toward international brands or cross-border e-commerce, so in the future they would definitely want Kaola. For Alibaba, they\u2019d want to prevent this,\u201d said Liu Yiming, who tracks China\u2019s e-commerce sector at the research division of 36kr.\n\nThe investment in NetEase Cloud Music, along with private-equity firm Yunfeng - which is backed by the tech giant\u2019s founder Jack Ma, is also a way for Alibaba and NetEase to ally against a common rival - Tencent Holdings.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nTencent Music dominates the Chinese music streaming market with an 83.8% share through three streaming services, according to Quest Mobile and Macquarie Research, but it recently reported the slowest increase in a key growth metric.\n\nIt is under investigation by China\u2019s antitrust authority in a review that could end exclusive licensing deals it forged with the world\u2019s biggest record labels, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nNetEase Music and Alibaba\u2019s Xiami have 10.3% and 2.1% market share, respectively.", "description": "Alibaba Group has agreed to buy e-commerce business Kaola from Chinese gaming company NetEase for $2 billion, adding a platform that specializes in supplying curated luxury goods from abroad to domestic consumers.", "authors": ["Josh Horwitz", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426798241&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8508H", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
