REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nThe authors will split the 50,000 pounds ($62,800) annual prize, the judging panel said. The award honors \u201cthe best novel of the year written in English and published in the UK and Ireland.\u201d\n\nAtwood, 79, previously won the prize in 2000 for \u201cThe Blind Assassin,\u201d and \u201cThe Testaments,\u201d published last month, is the sequel to the Canadian author\u2019s best-selling 1985 novel, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d\n\nEvaristo, the first black woman to win the prize, tells the stories of 12 characters, mainly female and black aged 19 to 93, living in Britain in \u201cGirl, Woman, Other.\u201d\n\nWhile the prize has been jointly awarded twice previously, the rules changed in 1993 limiting the award to one author. The judges defied those rules, saying they could not agree on a winner between the two books, which were on a shortlist of six.\n\n\u201cNeither of us expected to win this,\u201d Atwood said in her acceptance speech in a televised ceremony.\n\n\u201cI would have thought that I would have been too elderly and I kind of don\u2019t need the attention so I\u2019m very glad that you\u2019re getting some ... It would have been embarrassing if I had been alone here,\u201d she said to Evaristo.\n\nAtwood\u2019s book, eagerly awaited by fans, returns to the totalitarian state of Gilead some 15 years after the end of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d telling the story of three women.\n\nAtwood has said a deterioration in women\u2019s rights in some parts of the world including in the United States prompted her to write the sequel, described as a \u201csavage and beautiful novel\u201d by the judging panel.\n\nIn Britain, it was an immediate hit, selling just over 100,000 hardback copies in its first week of release.\n\nThe bleak dystopian \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d where women are banned from reading and writing and those that are fertile are forced into sexual servitude, was itself nominated for the Booker Prize.\n\n\u201cGirl, Woman, Other\u201d is Evaristo\u2019s eighth book of fiction, and was described by the judges as \u201ca must-read about modern Britain and womanhood\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is incredible. I suppose a lot of people say, \u2018I never thought it would happen to me,\u2019 and I will say I am the first black woman to win this prize,\u201d the British author, 60, said to loud applause.\n\n\u201cI hope that honor doesn\u2019t last too long. I hope that other people come forwards now,\u201d she said.", "description": "Margaret Atwood's \"The Testaments\" and Bernardine Evaristo's \"Girl, Woman, Other\" jointly won the Booker Prize on Monday in a surprise double award in which the literary prize recognized its oldest and first black woman winners.", "authors": ["Marie-Louise Gumuchian", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440873391&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D1VB-OCADN", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
