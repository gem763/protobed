That's without considering the current risks related to the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, or flashing recession signals, or other economic hurdles popping up around the globe.\n\n\"The global macroeconomic picture continues to show fragility,\" writes Northern Trust Wealth Management CIO Katie Nixon. \"We expect overall growth to trend lower under the weight of growing trade uncertainty.\"\n\nWhile investors might find shelter in big, blue-chip companies, you must be able to tell the difference between high-quality large caps and simply high-market-value large caps. The pros are here to help.\n\nHere are seven large-cap stocks to sell or avoid, according to Wall Street analysts. TipRanks, which collects ratings from roughly 15,000 Wall Street analysts, has honed in on a list of companies that are well-known but not particularly well-loved right now. We'll look into just how bearish sentiment is, and why the experts say you should avoid some of them, and boot the rest if you own them.\n\nSEE ALSO: All 30 Dow Stocks Ranked\n\nGeneral Electric\n\nGetty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket value: $76.9 billion\n\nTipRanks consensus price target: $9.81 (11% upside potential)\n\nTipRanks consensus rating: Hold\n\nEmbattled multinational General Electric (GE, $8.81) looked like it was finally stabilizing for most of this year. However, a recent report alleging accounting fraud \"bigger than Enron\" - a controversial one that some analysts are skeptical about - rattled prices over the past month.\n\nIn August, investigator Harry Markopolos - the whistleblower that helped blow open Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme - accused General Electric of accounting fraud worth $38 billion, which GE categorically denied. He alleges there are accounting issues in GE's long-term care insurance unit and Baker Hughes oil-and-gas unit, among other points.\n\nDeutsche Bank's Nicole DeBlase is among the analysts who are skeptical about the report's doomsday tone. \"We find some of its arguments to be weak while others are plainly incorrect,\" she writes, adding, \"We find ourselves in the unenviable position of having to defend the reserve adequacy of a business about whose future claim projections we have very deep concerns.\"\n\nStill, General Electric has more problems than most large-cap stocks, with or without the report. Several analysts have GE among their stocks to sell as a result.\n\nFor instance, JPMorgan's Stephen Tusa (Underweight, equivalent of Sell) described the company's recent Q2 earnings report as \"low quality.\" He made the call despite GE's earnings beat and instructed clients to sell into strength. Results reflect that \"the company may have fewer options than many think, forcing a protracted, drawn-out approach to the problems, a negative given cycle timing, and at odds with the message of urgency from last fall,\" he writes.\n\nGordon Haskett's John Inch reiterated his Underperform rating (equivalent of Sell), calling the earnings \"a modest step backward versus expectations.\" Analysts also said the departure of CFO Jaime Miller, after less than two years in the role, is a worrying signal for investors. \"We wonder about all these things, especially if things really are looking up, as management contends,\" comments Gimme Credit analyst Carol Levenson, who also rates GE at Underperform.", "description": "Volatile markets can sometimes drive investors into the assumed safety of large-cap stocks.
