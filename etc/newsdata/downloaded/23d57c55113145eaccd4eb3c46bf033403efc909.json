(Image: Netflix, YouTube)\n\nShe-Ra is back and heading our way surprisingly soon. The cast revealed the first teaser for She-Ra and the Princesses of Power\u2019s fourth season at New York Comic Con \u2014 which will consist of 13 episodes \u2014 along with the release date for the return of Adora, Catra, and the newly crowned Queen Glimmer... with a new look and outlook on life.\n\nNetflix has unveiled the first look at She-Ra and the Princesses of Power season 4, which returns November 5 with 13 episodes, meaning this one isn\u2019t truncated like the past two seasons. In an interview with Gizmodo, showrunner Noelle Stevenson shared how happy she was to see the series return to 13 episodes this season, noting how this story is one long thread that works best when watched together.\n\nStevenson confirmed there will be a time jump between seasons, but said it\u2019s not a major one. Following Queen Angella\u2019s \u201cdisappearance\u201d (Stevenson pointedly didn\u2019t call it a death), Glimmer is now queen of the rebellion, a role which comes with its own challenges, and Catra has seized power from Hordak to become co-leader of the Horde.\n\nThis leaves everyone else struggling to find their place and see where their relationships lie, as the threat of Horde Prime continues to grow.\n\nThe trailer also gives a peek at a new character, Double Trouble, the green Elven-looking figure who Stevenson described as a nonbinary shapeshifting mercenary, who Catra has brought on as protection and counsel. She was tight-lipped about who is voicing the new character, but said they\u2019ll be revealing that soon. Here\u2019s the synopsis for season 4:\n\nSeason 4 begins with the respective rises of Queen Glimmer as leader of the Rebellion and Catra as co-leader of the Horde. As the Horde makes advances on the Rebellion under the looming threat of Horde Prime\u2019s arrival, the Princess Alliance makes heroic strides but begins to disagree on the best way to defend Etheria. Ultimately, a shocking discovery about Etheria itself causes Adora to reconsider everything she thought she knew.\n\nWe\u2019ve also got a couple of new posters, which includes a peek at Catra and Glimmer\u2019s awesome new outfits \u2014 with Glimmer paying homage to her mother\u2019s queenly garments \u2014 and a better look at Double Trouble.\n\nPosters for the good and bad sides of She-Ra and the Princesses of Power.
