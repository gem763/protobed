Expect a free-flowing game with plenty of chances for both teams.\n\nThe pressure will be on Frank Lampard despite the odds being against him \u2013 he will not want to begin the season without a home win in four games at Stamford Bridge. If N\u2019Golo Kante is fit, he will play, but that is a big \u2018if\u2019.\n\nIf Kante does not play, Roberto Firmino will have a big impact on the game with Chelsea playing without a natural bridge between their defence and midfield \u2013 exactly the space in which the Brazilian does his best work.\n\nChelsea 1-2 Liverpool\n\nOdds\n\nChelsea 27/10\n\nDraw 11/4\n\nLiverpool EVS\n\nWhen is it?\n\nKick off at Stamford Bridge is at 4.30pm on Sunday September 22.\n\nHow can I watch it?\n\nSky Sports will be showing the game on their Main Event and Premier League channels, with coverage starting at 4pm.\n\nThe match can also be live streamed by Sky customers using the Sky Go app on mobile devices or PC.\n\nTeam News\n\nFrank Lampard has been boosted the return of N\u2019Golo Kante to training, but says \u201cno risks will be taken\u201d with regards to either his or Mason Mount\u2019s involvement.\n\nDespite Antonio Rudiger\u2019s fitness issues, Lampard is expected to continue with a back three as he looks for his first win at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea boss.\n\nLiverpool have Naby Keita still out, but Divock Origi could make a return to the squad after he went off injured against Newcastle.\n\nPredicted Line-ups\n\nChelsea \u2013 Kepa; Azpilicueta, Zouma, Christensen, Tomori, Alonso; Jorginho, Kovacic; Willian, Abraham, Barkley\n\nLiverpool \u2013 Adrian; Alexander-Arnold, Matip, van Dijk, Robertson; Fabinho, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Wijnaldum; Salah, Firmino, Mane\n\nLatest updates\n\nHead-to-head Chelsea have won just one of the past nine Premier League meetings between the sides, drawing five and losing three. Liverpool have claimed five victories from their last 11 league trips to Stamford Bridge and the Blues have scored in all-but one of their last 20 meetings with Liverpool in all competitions. Liverpool are big favourites but Chelsea will throw everything they have at the Reds and maybe, just maybe, something will stick. Chelsea are searching for their first win at Stamford Bridge under Frank Lampard but it'll be a tough, tough ask. Liverpool have won their first five games of the season to make it 14 wins in a row but their first dropped points last season came against Chelsea. Team news N'Golo Kante makes his first start for Chelsea since August after recovering from an ankle injury. Mason Mount is also fit after a knock against Valencia midweek. There is also a start for Emerson after the full-back recovered from injury. He replaces Marcos Alonso. There\u2019s two changes for Liverpool from their last Premier League game as Roberto Firmino returns to the starting XI while Jordan Henderson replaces Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in midfield. Team news - Liverpool Advertisement Team news - Chelsea Chelsea and Liverpool met in the Super Cup before the start of the Premier League season with the Reds coming away as champions after a penalty shootout. Jurgen Klopp has seen the effect that the young players have had on the Chelsea team and he credits Frank Lampard for that improvement. He said: \"Chelsea had some problems but they have sorted it well. I don't think they expected [to lose to Valencia]. It reminds me of my team in Dortmund a few years ago. Really young but they only played because they were that good. \"Frank Lampard did an outstanding job at Derby so I am not surprised by him at Chelsea. But it is a difficult league. I can see some people are not happy with some results but that is not because of him. He is a really good manager.\" A once fierce and fiery rivalry, one that pitted Frank Lampard against Steven Gerrard, has lost it's spark. How did that happen and can it be reignited? How a fiery rivalry between Liverpool and Chelsea lost its spark The match of the weekend will see Jurgen Klopp's unbeaten Liverpool side taken on Frank Lampard's Chelsea youngsters at Stamford Bridge. The early team news is that Chelsea's Mason Mount faces a fitness test on the ankle sprain he suffered in their midweek Champions League loss. N'Golo Kante is in contention after returning to training but Emerson Palmieri is once again doubtful. Divock Origi is unlikely to play, for Liverpool due to his ongoing ankle injury. Naby Keita is back in full training, while keeper Alisson and Nathaniel Clyne both remain out. Advertisement Welcome to The Independent's live coverage of Chelsea vs Liverpool.
