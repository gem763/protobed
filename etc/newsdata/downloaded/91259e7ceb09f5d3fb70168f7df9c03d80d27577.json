However, the Navy's 21 \"minor combatant\" vessels, which includes the Armidale class, spent 400 fewer days at sea than planned because of \"emerging defects across platforms and extensions to planned maintenance periods\".\n\nOne of the biggest drivers has been currency movements since that time, which has added $161 million to the sustainment costs.\n\nOpposition assistant defence spokesman Pat Conroy said it was \"incredibly concerning\" the sustainment budget had increased by $570 million and reflected the fact that costs were not being accurately planned and managed.\n\nHe blamed the government's inability to ensure new acquisitions were being delivered on time, with 14 major projects worth $15 billion a cumulative 311 months late.\n\n\"This means the ADF is forced to run its ageing equipment for longer and harder than planned, leading to a 10 per cent blowout in the sustainment budget,\u201d Mr Conroy said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also problematic that the government has underestimated the cost of running some of the newer pieces of kit. For example, the air-to-air refuelling tanker is costing 37 per cent more per annum to run than budgeted for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s mismanagement of Defence is leading to taxpayers' funds being wasted and our soldiers, sailors and aircrews not getting the equipment they need when they need it. This could have a real impact on the ground for Australian Defence Force personnel.\"\n\nDefence disputed the $570 million blowout figure, saying $367 million of the increase came from a combination of government approvals since the May 2018 budget for new projects and exchange rate movements.\n\nActual expenditure exceeded the budget by only $203 million, with only $72 million coming from a range of net variations across the budget.\n\nDefence also denied the government's efforts to stop boat people reaching Australia was compromised because of service issues with the patrol boat fleet.\n\nThe Armidale and Cape class patrol boats underwent regular maintenance and remediation work because of increased operational requirements.\n\n\"It is prudent for the Navy to undertake even more rigorous maintenance to maintain the seaworthiness of all vessels, ensuring the safety of the crew,\" Defence said.\n\n\"Even with this increased maintenance, Navy has consistently met the patrol boat requirement for Operation Resolute, which is the Australian Defence Force\u2019s contribution to Operation Sovereign Borders.\"", "description": "Labor says delays with delivery of new equipment is forcing Defence to keep its warships, aircraft and weapons in service longer than expected.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4197%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1b73d658099bf34e6863e76a921f6099bc75e48c", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
