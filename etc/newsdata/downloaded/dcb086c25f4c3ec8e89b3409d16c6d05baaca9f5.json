No droopy eyelids!", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nTo maintain a consistent youth is too difficult. However, if you look at the stars of envy, you will be amazed by their constant youth and beauty. In particular, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jessica Chastain, and Anne Hathaway, who have been active in Hollywood for a long time, have been with the public for ages while maintaining their beauty and youth, which is not much different from the beginning of their debut. What do you need to do to keep up with the baby faces of the three Hollywood\\'s favorite stars?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to keep your eyes from drooping but firm, an anti-aging product that reduces signs of aging is not an option but is a must. In particular, for the skin around the eyes, which is sensitive, thin and easily wrinkled, you need to choose the anti-aging products for the eyes, so that the delicate and gentle care is possible.\n\n\n\nApply a small amount of the product on the side of the eyes and pat it gently using the ring finger that is known to have the weakest strength. If you rub your eyes with excessive force when you do this, it is easy to get wrinkles while applying the product. So special care for the skin around the eyes is essential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo avoid droopy eyes, it is important to minimize irritation on eyes as much as using anti-aging products to care for your eyes.\n\n\n\nIn particular, in the process of removing eye makeup, applying excessive force to erase eye makeup or rubbing hard to the left or right can cause wrinkles on the eyes, and repetition of these actions may cause dropping eyes. Remember that it\\'s important to gently touch your eyes because they are more sensitive and thinner than any other skin on your face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-aging products and careful eye care are good habits for daily practice, but there are limitations to correcting excessively drooping eyes with product and habit improvement. In particular, sagging over the eyes can lead to functional problems such as decreased vision. Considering eye health, one option is to consider upper eyelid surgery, which can correct drooping eyes.\n\n\n\nBae Joon-sung (Plastic Surgery Specialist), director of JK Plastic Surgery Center in Korea, said, \u201cIf the dropping eyelids obstruct your vision, your eyebrows will be raised upward. Forcing yourself to open your eyes can make your forehead wrinkles worse. If your drooping eyelids stress you out as you get older, an in-depth consultation with a specialist is one way.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpper eyelid surgery is a surgery that can make you look young by improving the sagging eyelids, as well as improving the functional areas of the eyelids that obstruct the vision or cause wrinkles generated from opening eyes with the forehead. Surgical methods are used to remove wrinkled skin and unnecessary fat to strengthen the muscles that open the eyes.\n\n\n\nDirector Bae Joon-sung said, \\\"It takes a lot of conditions to make a young image, but it\\'s important to take care of your skin around the eyes that are severely drooping and wrinkled as you get older. If you want to find the eye shape that matches your face well, surgery after an in-depth consultation with a specialist is effective to have the perfect eye shape.\\\"\n\n\n\nFollowing 2017, JK Plastic Surgery Center, which received the Korean Accreditation Program for Hospitals Serving Foreign Patients (KAHF) certification from the Korean government (Ministry of Health and Welfare) twice in a row in 2019, provides a \u2018one-stop examination for operation\u2019, with a priority for accurate analysis and diagnosis of the patient\\'s health.
