But that transition is proving to be complicated for a certain subset of Mac users who\u2019ve relied on the software to help manage their jobs: DJs.\n\nAccording to Apple, along with Catalina\u2019s removal of iTunes, users are also losing XML file support as all native music playback on Macs moves over to the official Music app, which has a new library format. XML file support is a popular organizational feature for DJs who use it to sort tracks into playlists and utilize the \u201cShare iTunes Library XML with other applications\u201d option to seamlessly transmit data between apps.\n\niTunes became the de facto way for lots of DJs to sort through their massive file libraries\n\nTons of popular DJ apps, like Rekordbox and Traktor, read XML files, and over the years, iTunes became the de facto way for lots of DJs to sort through their massive file libraries and quickly find tracks while performing.\n\nBut this means updating to Catalina will replace iTunes with Music, and that, in turn, will break communication between the app and pretty much all existing DJ software. According to Apple if a customer is reliant on XML files for DJing, they should avoid updating and continue using their preferred software on macOS Mojave until developers push out fixes (some, like Serato, are already trying out new beta versions tailored for Catalina). iTunes on Windows has not changed, so apps on Microsoft\u2019s platform should function as normal.\n\nAdditionally, according to Apple a previously reported fix saying users can manually export XML files in the Music app is incorrect. Essentially, if you\u2019re a DJ and you have put tons of time into sorting music in your iTunes playlists for whatever software you use, upgrading to Catalina will likely erase all your hard work.", "description": "Apple\u2019s latest desktop operating system update, macOS Catalina, will mark the official end of iTunes after nearly two decades.
