Videos released by the robotics company capture the machine jumping over logs, doing backflips and running outdoors. (Courtesy of Boston Dynamics)\n\nThe Internet gawks each time Boston Dynamics releases a new video showing its eye-catching humanoid robot, Atlas, performing newly acquired acrobatic tricks.\n\nBut until now, most of the machine\u2019s maneuvering \u2014 whether it was jogging, hopping over a log or executing box jumps \u2014 has remained well within the realm of average human athleticism.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nIf the tech company\u2019s recently uploaded video is any indication, Atlas has, in a matter of months, graduated from middle-school gym class to something approaching a professional athlete. In the 38-second video, the sturdy, battery-powered machine \u2014 standing 4 foot 9 inches and weighing 176 pounds \u2014 unleashes an exceedingly nimble routine (using its legs, arms and torso) with a degree of gracefulness that you\u2019d expect from a human being with years of training.\n\n\u201cWe created the maneuvers using new techniques that streamline the development process,\u201d Boston Dynamics wrote in the video\u2019s description. \u201cFirst, an optimization algorithm transforms high-level descriptions of each maneuver into dynamically-feasible reference motions. Then Atlas tracks the motions using a model predictive controller that smoothly blends from one maneuver to the next.\u201d\n\nDespite that smoothness, the robot isn\u2019t perfect, according to its handlers.\n\n\u201cUsing this approach, we developed the routine significantly faster than previous Atlas routines, with a performance success rate of about 80%,\u201d the description adds.\n\n[For his latest trick, Atlas the headless humanoid robot does parkour]\n\nWithin hours of being posted online, the latest Atlas video had racked up nearly 1.5 million views and thousands of comments, many of them suggesting the robot\u2019s newfound athleticism was evidence that mankind\u2019s reign over machines is nearing its expiration date.\n\n\u201cSo we just going to keep acting like we never seen Terminator?\u201d one commenter wrote.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely amazing!\u201d added another. \u201cI can smell the future where robots are roaming in the streets with us!\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Boston Dynamics has become known for two things: creating robots whose movements mimic humans and animals with a degree of accuracy that many find surprising, if not unnerving. And then, without warning, posting cryptic videos of those robots online, where they quickly go viral, capturing some mixture of excitement and terror about the rapid rise of autonomous machines.\n\nBoston Dynamics was purchased by Japan\u2019s Softbank from Alphabet in 2017. In recent years, it has produced four-legged robots \u2014 with names like Spot, Wildcat and BigDog \u2014 that can open doors, carry heavy loads and run nearly 20 miles per hour, but its most recognizable product appears to be Atlas, the humanoid athlete that Boston Dynamics labels, \u201cthe world\u2019s most dynamic humanoid robot.\u201d\n\nGuided by lidar \u2014 a sensor that uses a pulsed laser sensor to measure the distance between objects \u2014 and stereo vision, the compact robot is able to haul nearly 25 pounds. Boston Dynamics says Atlas can also manipulate objects in its environment, traverse rough terrain, keep its balance when pushed and get back up when tipped over.\n\n[New video shows a humanoid robot crossing a balance beam with ease]\n\nAs recently as three years ago, Atlas was recorded awkwardly tramping through the snow at a slow speed, its mechanical body lacking any of the fluidity and agility that it displays now.\n\nCuriosity about Atlas gained momentum last year when Boston Dynamics posted a 34-second clip on YouTube showing the formerly halting robot going for a casual and smooth-looking jog in a grassy residential area. The video, which captured the distinct photocopier-like sound created by the robot\u2019s movements, seemed to catch many viewers by surprise, including the Daily Mail, which covered Atlas\u2019s physical feat at the time.\n\n\u201cIf you thought you\u2019d be able to run away from the terrifying new breed of robots,\u201d the paper wrote, \u201cbad news.\u201d\n\nMORE READING:\n\nMIT\u2019s latest dog-like robot can do backflips on command\n\nNew video shows a humanoid robot crossing a balance beam with ease\n\nBoston Dynamics\u2019 latest video shows a herd of robotic dogs hauling a massive truck with ease", "description": "Three years ago it was barely walking.
