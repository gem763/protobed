Photo: Marc Brenner\n\nThere\u2019s not much onstage in the new, minimalist production of Harold Pinter\u2019s Betrayal, currently on Broadway, besides Tom Hiddleston, the actors who play his wife (Zawe Ashton) and best friend (Charlie Cox) \u2014 who are carrying on an affair \u2014 and two identical chairs that are so elegant I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off them. When our theater critic Sarah Holdren reviewed the show, she praised the way director Jamie Lloyd\u2019s \u201cstripped-to-the-bone approach to the play\u2019s environment lets the text breathe and stretch. We can really hear Pinter\u2019s words pinging off the big blank wall of Soutra Gilmour\u2019s set, with its neutral palette and vast, clean emptiness.\u201d I wanted to know more about the chairs. When you look at them closely, you realize that there is a slight crick, a bending at the top, as if they are misbehaving. It turns out they\u2019re by Italian designer Gio Ponti, who created them in 1957, and they\u2019re called Superleggera. (Italian for \u201csuperlight\u201d \u2014 you can buy this version for $710.) The action takes place in different locations over time rolled backwards, but the chairs are always there. I called up Lloyd and Gilmore to ask about their casting.\n\n\u201cThe usual approach to Betrayal is that each scene is presented naturalistically,\u201d Lloyd says. \u201cWhen you go to the flat there is a scene change; when you to the restaurant there is a scene change.\u201d But after directing a number of Pinter plays, he\u2019d become convinced of the advantage of less-is-more staging. \u201cWe really wanted to strip the play out, to focus on the human relationships,\u201d instead of the set, he says. \u201cYou\u2019re actually looking for an emotional through line.\u201d\n\nThe Ponti chairs were the first that Gilmore presented him, and he knew they were right immediately. \u201cYou can imagine I\u2019m a fanatic about things like chairs, and I am also a huge fan of mid-century modern design because I think it was in touch with something quite rustic and handmade, and also with an elegant modernism,\u201d says Gilmore. \u201cWe were interested in a space where all of the actors could be there all of the time, so that you never possibly forget one person\u2019s part in the triangle, so we wanted this space that felt appropriate for them all to be inhabiting at all times. And had we gone for a pub, or something, it would have been really crazy for the other person to be sitting on a chair at the back of the pub. We needed a language of something much more universal and emotional and metaphorical.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are very few bits of furniture that could cope with turning around, and turning around on a rake, and look like they belong to \u2026 anywhere, and everywhere,\u201d said Gilmore \u201cThey could work in a restaurant and be emotional and be elegant, so I just \u2014 I am a big Gio Ponti fan, I think he is a kind of superintelligent designer, and really as soon as I saw those I thought, that\u2019s them, that is the one. It doesn\u2019t feel feel heavy in any way. It kind of floats in the same way that we want everybody else to float, and that tilt back, as you say, gives you a kind of emotional quality, and it\u2019s so subtle. It\u2019s like you might think it\u2019s not there and then you see it there, and it\u2019s so clever, that design, and it just sat very very nicely with a handmade quality and the finish we had chosen with the plaster finish (of the back wall of the set). I wanted something that would feel inside and outside and could be in Italy. It\u2019s a finish that we all have a relationship with.\u201d\n\nFor the actors, \u201cthey could all have very subtle different relationships whether they sat formally on it, or they sat astride it. Or they sat up against it, and that chair allowed for all of those things, and it was in rehearsals from day one, so it\u2019s as much of a character onstage as anybody else, and it becomes all furniture, doesn\u2019t it? It becomes everything in their lives; it becomes the empty house and the full house, and the romantic holiday spot that\u2019s not romantic, you know, all of those things.\u201d\n\nJust as Pinter\u2019s characters don\u2019t say what they feel, \u201cIt\u2019s what you don\u2019t see in the design that makes it most effective,\u201d says Lloyd. \u201cThe movement \u2014 obviously I wanted a sense of time passing, memory, connections to the past \u2014 are a big part of every Pinter play. And of course, Betrayal, most of the time you are moving backward. A real sense of moving through time and space was a kind of interesting notion. But it\u2019s so delicate. It\u2019s such a precise play, and you have to have a real discipline in creating it and performing it that every move has to be so subtle. It needed to have such a kind of simple elegance, to be able to change locations but to do it so effortlessly so that you never break the spell of the play, because there is so much tension underneath it all, isn\u2019t there? And that quiet lonely pain underneath that exists through all the scenes, so it feels that you cannot break that in any way with a blackout or a sudden big scene change. And that revolve in the scene is doing what a cinematic score might do when you\u2019re watching a movie. The movement of the set gives you a sense of something rumbling beneath them.\u201d", "description": "There\u2019s not much onstage in the new, minimalist production of Harold Pinter\u2019s \u2018Betrayal,\u2019 currently on Broadway, besides Tom Hiddleston and two identical Gio Ponti Superleggera chairs that are so elegant I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off them.", "authors": ["Wendy Goodman"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/12/magazine/Betrayal2.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
