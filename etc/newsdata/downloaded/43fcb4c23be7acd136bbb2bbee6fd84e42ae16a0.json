In reality, it\u2019s very, very difficult and not the best source of capital for most businesses.\n\nFor startups hoping to scale far and wide as fast as possible, VC may be the right fit. To shed light on the process of raising equity capital from venture capital firms and provide some exclusive tips and tricks for Extra Crunch subscribers, we sat down with three experts on the subject. Below are the top pieces of advice from Charles Hudson, founder and managing partner of Precursor Ventures, Redpoint Ventures general partner Annie Kadavy, and DocSend founder Russ Heddleston. The following has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\n1. First, make sure your company is fit to raise venture capital.\n\nCharles Hudson: I think venture capital, it\u2019s really a specialty type of capital. It\u2019s really for companies that have the aspiration to grow really quickly, to build really large businesses \u2026 If you\u2019re not a company that needs to grow quickly, venture capital might not be the right source of capital for you. There has to be a really big prize at the end of the journey.\n\n2. Raise capital early if you\u2019re stressing about small costs or fretting competition\n\nRuss Heddleston: If you\u2019re thinking about whether or not to raise, there are a couple of reasons that I will often advise people to raise early. One is if they\u2019re really stressing about buying a whiteboard for their office, or like some something of relatively small cost. If you think it could be a big company, and you\u2019re stressing about small things, raise money and buy the whiteboard, hire the additional person and get back to what you should be doing, which is running your business and growing it quickly. The other thing is if you ask the question, \u2018is there a competitor I don\u2019t know about?\u2019 If you heard tomorrow, that competitor just raised $2 million, or $5 million or $10 million, how nervous would that make you? For some businesses, you\u2019re like, I don\u2019t really care, it\u2019s a services industry, it\u2019s not a winner take all market. And other times, you\u2019re like, oh, I\u2019d be really nervous. So if either those apply, that\u2019s a good reason to make a compelling case to someone like Charles.\n\nThe number one thing you can do to get a VC\u2019s attention is make [your pitch] really simple.
