Most nights he sleeps a total of four hours.\n\nChronic sleep deprivation is only one symptom of a consuming and debilitating constellation of problems that has astonished and baffled nearly 100 doctors around the country with whom Schwartz has consulted since 2016.\n\nDespite his herculean efforts, the 59-year-old retired medical malpractice lawyer turned philanthropist still doesn\u2019t have a diagnosis.\n\nIn addition to his nocturnal urinary problem, Schwartz suffers from massive shifts of body fluids when he stands up or lies down, very high blood pressure, chronic digestive disorders, severe hormonal imbalances, muscle wasting on his left side and exhaustion.\n\nHe has traveled to the Mayo Clinic twice and to the Cleveland Clinic. Last fall, Schwartz, who lives near Detroit, spent a week at the Undiagnosed Diseases Program at the National Institutes of Health. The highly selective 11-year-old effort by the nation's preeminent research hospital is designed to diagnose the most perplexing illnesses.\n\n\n\nBob Schwartz has seen nearly 100 doctors around the country in search of a diagnosis for his debilitating illness. His efforts for an answer to his ailment continues. (Family photo)\n\nYet the former marathon runner remains what one Mayo specialist dubbed him: \u201ca zebra among zebras\u201d \u2014 medical slang for an extraordinarily rare case.\n\nNIH doctors have identified an apparent reason for his symptoms \u2014 his veins are grossly enlarged and too stretchy \u2014 but they don\u2019t know why or how to treat it. And they\u2019ve never seen a similar case.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have an answer yet,\u201d said Donna Novacic, the attending internist at NIH\u2019s Clinical Center who coordinated the multidisciplinary team of experts that examined him in Bethesda last year. Schwartz, she noted, \u201chas quite an enduring spirit despite a very complicated problem.\u201d\n\nFor Schwartz, the singular nature of his case and the lack of a diagnosis have caused moments of existential despair. But he says he has resolved to learn everything he can about the illness that has upended every aspect of his life.\n\nSchwartz said he hopes his story will elicit suggestions that could provide him some relief. Because philanthropic work is the cornerstone of his life, he wants to \u201chelp others facing their own battle who can glean something, or reach out to me for advice.\u201d\n\nThe ultimate 'zebra'\n\nUntil 2016, Schwartz said, he was \u201cthe epitome of health.\u201d A vegetarian since high school, he never smoked or drank alcohol. A lifelong and enthusiastic athlete, he ran 10 miles a day and played basketball.\n\nIn 2007, Schwartz, then 47, retired from his law practice. With his wife, Robin, a graphic artist, he founded the Here to Help Foundation, of which he is chief executive. The private, nonprofit foundation has awarded small one-time cash grants to more than 7,500 residents of southeast Michigan. Some are newly released prisoners, others are trying to stave off eviction or need money to buy a reliable used car to get to work.\n\nSometime in 2016, Schwartz said he began feeling tired. During his outdoor runs, his hands and feet felt unusually sensitive to the cold.\n\n\u201cI just thought, \u2018We\u2019ll, I\u2019m getting older,\u2019 \u201d Schwartz said.\n\nThe urinary problem started in 2017. During the day, no matter how much liquid Schwartz consumed, he produced little urine. \u201cBut when I lay down in bed at night,\u201d he recalled, the opposite occurred. His nightly urine output totaled about 51 ounces \u2014 the equivalent of 1\u00bd quarts. Urologists could find nothing to explain the phenomenon.\n\nIn September 2017, Schwartz landed in Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak near his home. His blood pressure was sky-high: 180/100, far above his normal 110/65. He had no energy and his extremities, particularly his legs, felt heavy and swollen.\n\nDoctors quickly determined that Schwartz was suffering from hyponatremia, sometimes called water intoxication. The concentration of sodium in his blood was dangerously low, putting him at risk for serious complications, including brain swelling that can lead to coma or death.\n\nUnable to find the cause, doctors transferred Schwartz to the University of Michigan. He spent a week there and doctors were able to control his hyponatremia, which they determined was caused by an unexplained increase in his blood plasma volume. Michigan specialists referred him to the Mayo Clinic. At Mayo, according to an interventional radiologist at Michigan, \u201chis condition continued to amaze and perplex\u201d doctors.\n\nA scan revealed that Schwartz\u2019s iliac veins, which feed the inferior vena cava, the body\u2019s largest vein that carries deoxygenated blood to the heart, were greatly enlarged, as were his vena cava and his aorta.\n\nBut the results of several tests were inherently contradictory. Despite chronic hyponatremia, Schwartz exhibited clear signs of dehydration during the day while upright. But when he lay down at night, fluid gushed back to his kidneys, causing excessive urination.\n\nMayo experts ruled out several possible diagnoses, including vasculitis, a group of rare diseases caused by blood vessel inflammation.\n\n\u201cThey asked me [to] come back in a year to see what had evolved,\u201d Schwartz said. When he returned, doctors had nothing new to suggest.\n\n'A very dark place'\n\nSchwartz, who is fluent in the language of medicine, spent much of 2018 consulting experts around the country, most via videoconference. He sought out specialists in cardiology, blood vessel diseases and endocrinology, as well as anyone he believed might have a hypothesis about what might be wrong or how to help him.\n\nAn interventional radiologist at Michigan referred Schwartz to NIH\u2019s Undiagnosed Diseases Program. Schwartz, the radiologist wrote in his referral letter, \u201chas been untiring in seeking an explanation for his illness\u201d and hopes NIH experts could \u201cshed some additional light on what has been a very dark place.\u201d\n\nThe program, which has seen about 1,200 patients and rejects approximately 80 percent of those who apply, accepted him. \u201cIt was a compelling case,\u201d Novacic said.\n\nCare offered at NIH and the 11 other sites around the country that constitute the Undiagnosed Diseases Network is free. The effort has several goals: to identify previously undiagnosed disorders, to determine their possible genetic underpinnings and to provide useful advice to suffering patients, even in the absence of a diagnosis.\n\nSince its inception, the network has unearthed a diagnosis in approximately 35 percent of cases and identified 31 new syndromes. Some diagnoses are made through a sophisticated and time-consuming genetic analysis known as DNA sequencing.\n\n\u201cThere have been cases that were solved years later,\u201d Novacic said. \u201cWe may find an answer in the future, even if we don\u2019t have it now.\u201d Patients are told that their information will be kept in an extensive database and that they will be notified if an answer is found.\n\nThe role of running\n\nIn late October 2018, Schwartz and his wife, whom he describes as \u201ca pillar of strength and hope\u201d spent a week at NIH. His team included cardiologists, rheumatologists, vascular specialists, a geneticist and an expert in dysautonomia, a disorder of the autonomic nervous system, which controls breathing and heartbeat.\n\nSchwartz, who called the team \u201cphenomenal,\u201d underwent numerous additional tests, including a highly specialized PET scan not available outside the research hospital.\n\nOnce again, experts were mystified.\n\nThe case that most resembles Schwartz\u2019s, Novacic said, is that of a marathon runner with very enlarged veins who suffered from recurrent blood clots. He was seen at NIH several years ago, but so far doesn\u2019t have a diagnosis.\n\nIn Schwartz\u2019s case, the leading hypothesis is that his enlarged and overly stretchy venous system might reflect a subtle problem with the collagen in his connective tissue. It is possible that the collagen, a protein that functions as a sort of scaffolding and holds the body together, is not strong enough to support the walls of his veins. He also shows signs of dysautonomia.\n\n\u201cYears of running might have exacerbated the problem,\u201d Novacic said, possibly through the repeated pounding involved. But it is also possible, she noted, that running was in some way protective, delaying the onset of symptoms that might otherwise have materialized earlier. One possibility is that the underlying cause may be genetic.\n\n\u201cGenerally when we think of genetic disease, you think of a child born with it,\u201d Novacic said. \u201cBut there are many situations where you have a predisposition to a certain problem and it doesn\u2019t manifest for years.\u201d\n\nNovacic said that Schwartz\u2019s DNA is being sequenced at Baylor College of Medicine for possible clues. Results are still pending.\n\nTo help control daytime swelling, NIH experts recommended that Schwartz wear specialized compression garments.\n\n\u201cWithout strong [blood] vessel walls, the only thing you can do is compress from the outside,\u201d Novacic said. Unfortunately the team had no advice about ways to curb his nighttime urination.\n\nNovacic said she is acutely aware of the plight of patients like Schwartz who don\u2019t receive a diagnosis.\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of angst and uncertainty.\u201d\n\nSchwartz said he derives perverse satisfaction from the knowledge that he has done everything humanly possible to find an answer.\n\nHe tries to focus on other things. He exercises every day on a specialized rowing machine to try to maintain some level of fitness. He spends time with close friends familiar with his situation and takes pleasure in his three grown children. Foundation work is a full-time job, providing a strong sense of purpose and serving as a welcome distraction from the physical and emotional ravages of his illness.\n\nMany of the foundation\u2019s clients have served time in prison and Schwartz has become friendly with one client who was wrongly incarcerated for decades for a crime he did not commit.\n\n\u201cHe knows in a general sense what I\u2019ve been going through,\u201d Schwartz said. The man recently sent him a quote meant to be applicable to both their lives that Schwartz finds particularly resonant.\n\n\u201cAnyone can give up, it\u2019s the easiest thing in the world to do. But to hold it together when everyone would understand if you fell apart, that\u2019s true strength.\u201d\n\nSubmit your solved medical mystery to sandra.boodman@washpost.com.
