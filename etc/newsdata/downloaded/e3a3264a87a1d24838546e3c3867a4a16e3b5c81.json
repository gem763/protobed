I think we\u2019ve got to see how Formula One develops and we are at a crucial time now to see where the regulations go and how it all pans out,\u201d said the Austrian, principal of the Mercedes Grand Prix team.\n\n\u201cIts a different topic in supplying customers, which is a standalone decision.\u201d\n\nFormula One is set for a major shake-up in 2021 with new regulations designed to make the sport more competitive along with the introduction of a budget cap. A new commercial agreement has yet to be finalised, however.\n\nMercedes, the home of world champion Lewis Hamilton, have won the Formula One drivers\u2019 and constructors\u2019 titles for the past five seasons and are making their debut in Formula E in November.\n\nWolff said he and Niki Lauda, the team\u2019s late non-executive chairman, used to have \u2018big discussions\u2019 about whether Mercedes should supply other teams or just concentrate on the works outfit.\n\n\u201cSince then times have changed a little bit. We believe that the learning curve is steeper with having more engines out there,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou saw that we had some failures on (Robert) Kubica\u2019s (Williams) car in Spa and on (Sergio) Perez\u2019s (Racing Point) car in Monza and that is part of the learning process.\n\n\u201cIt is a cash topic also, one more customer means better cash flow for Daimler (Mercedes\u2019s parent company) overall and we are up for the challenge. McLaren is a great team and a good group of people.\u201d\n\nMercedes engines look set to be supplied to four of the 10 teams in 2021, with Racing Point currently using them along with the world champions.", "description": "New engine deals with McLaren and Williams are not linked to Mercedes's future in Formula One as a works team and the brand's involvement in the all-electric Formula E series, motorsport head Toto Wolff has said.", "authors": ["Alan Baldwin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435664568&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T0UN", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
