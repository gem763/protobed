Manny Bermudez via verbal submission (armbar) \u2013 Round 1, 2:46\n\nUpdated records: Rosa (12-3 MMA, 3-3 UFC), Bermudez (14-2 MMA, 3-2 UFC)\n\nKey stat: Rosa improved to 3-0 in the UFC when fighting at TD Garden in Boston.\n\nRosa on the fight\u2019s key moment\n\n\u201cHe was known as the jiu-jitsu guy in the division, but I guess we all know now who the jiu-jitsu guy in the division is.\u201d\n\nRosa on returning from injury, long layoff\n\n\u201cGetting back into the win column is the best feeling in the world. This is everything I\u2019ve worked for over the last 10 years, especially over the last two years with my injury. I thought about this every day, and this is what kept me going \u2013 this exact moment. It was extremely hard. There were days where physical therapists and doctors doubted me. But even if there was a 1 percent chance that I was coming back and make it, even if they told me I couldn\u2019t, I would have. But I did it. I\u2019m back. First-round finish, and I\u2019m coming for the title.\u201d\n\nRosa on what he wants next\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 3-0 in the Boston Garden now, undefeated in Boston, and I\u2019m going to keep going.
