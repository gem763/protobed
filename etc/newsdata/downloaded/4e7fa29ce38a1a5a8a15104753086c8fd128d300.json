The song first hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 on Sept. 20 of that year.\n\n\"It was very catchy, it had a great hook, it was very sing-able and we laughed \u2014 we had a good time doing it,\" Toni Wine, one of the real singer-songwriters behind The Archies' hit, says.\n\nAs Wine explains, she and singer Ron Donte were doing commercials and background voice work in New York when legendary music producer Don Kirshner, who also produced for The Monkees, brought them onto the project.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\n\"Ronnie was Archie and I was Betty and Veronica,\" she says. \"Betty had a lower voice, Veronica had a higher voice.\"\n\nThe Archie Show, which launched in the fall of 1968, followed the misadventures of Riverdale High School's Archie Andrews and his friends: Reggie, Veronica, Betty and Jughead. The group of friends would appear in the show as the band The Archies and perform songs. Some of these songs were released as real-life albums and singles.\n\n\"Sugar, Sugar,\" which was co-written by Andy Kim and Jeff Barry, who also lent their talents for the background vocals, was the fictional group's most successful song. Initially released on May 24, 1969, the song didn't hit it big until July, when it was re-released on Calendar/Kirshner Records. Kim says at first, stations wouldn't play it.\n\n\"I had no idea what was going on except a lot of people I the know were putting the song and the record down, as if it was fluff,\" Kim says. \"As if it didn't mean anything, there was no value to it.\"\n\nOnce radio did start playing it, there was no looking back. \"Sugar, Sugar\" would spend 22 weeks in the Billboard Hot 100, four of those weeks \u2014 Sept. 20 to Oct. 11 \u2014 atop the No. 1 spot.\n\nThe Archies is not only the first fictitious band to reach No. 1 on the Billboard charts in the U.S., but is also the only group to reach such heights without ever performing the song live onstage.\n\nThe song also hit No. 1 in countries around the world such as Belgium, South Africa and the U.K. The song went on to reach gold status, selling nearly 1 million copies in 1969 alone.\n\nKim says he was \"really, really blown away\" when it was announced as the No. 1 song of 1969. \"The year of Woodstock, the year that we landed on the moon, the year everyone was talking about Charles Manson and The Beatles were breaking up and they had that concert on the roof,\" he says. \"There was this song that just showed up.\"\n\nOver the years, \"Sugar, Sugar\" has been covered by other artists such as Tom Jones, Tina Turner and Wilson Pickett. Many people who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s still remember cutting out The Archies albums attached to the back of cereal boxes and playing the them on their record players. Moreover, the song remains a moment of levity for those living through a turbulent time in U.S. history.\n\nYouTube\n\nKim admits that, at the time, he didn't understand the magnitude of the song. \"Until I got a little older and saw it from a different point of view,\" he says. \"And now, 50 years later, I'm look at it from someone who's on the back porch of his days and it's kind of really sweet.\"", "description": "Fifty years ago, the song \"Sugar, Sugar\" by The Archies reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
