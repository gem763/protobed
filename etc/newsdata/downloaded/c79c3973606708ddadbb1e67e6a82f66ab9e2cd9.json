So that is two times that are lost in costs such as logistics and tariffs, information etc.I think that is where we need to work on, in overcoming and lowering those logistics and transportation costs and those tariffs.So we should foster more of that to open more our economies and really look for win-win situation for economic growth development for both our regions.\"With this summit highlighting the importance of partnerships between the two regions, Latin American companies are looking forward to opportunities to build strong, high-quality networks with South Korean companies and investors.Hong Yoo, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
