The dollar was traded at 108.86 yen , after having hit a three-month high of 109.07 yen.\n\nThe Bank of Japan is widely expected to keep its policy on hold on Thursday.\n\nThe euro stood flat at $1.1111 ( ), having bounced off from Tuesday's low of $1.10735.\n\nThe British pound wobbled after Britain decided to hold an election on Dec. 12 after Prime Minister Boris Johnson won approval from parliament for an early ballot aimed at breaking the Brexit deadlock.\n\nWhile Johnson seeks to gain a parliamentary majority to ratify his Brexit deal, the election would be highly unpredictable as Brexit has fatigued and enraged swathes of voters, while eroding traditional loyalties to the two major parties, Conservative and Labour.\n\nThe currency last traded at $1.2864 , down 0.1% so far on Wednesday.\n\nOil prices slipped after an industry report that stocks at the Cushing delivery hub for the benchmark rose last week, shrugging off a drop in overall inventories.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude ( ) lost 0.47% to $55.28 per barrel while international benchmark Brent crude ( ) futures dropped 0.19% to $61.47 a barrel.", "description": "Stocks falter ahead of Fed on trade deal worries", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9T01L_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
