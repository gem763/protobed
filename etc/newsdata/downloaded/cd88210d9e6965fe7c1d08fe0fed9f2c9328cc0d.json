'The same if we were doing the show in another country.'\n\n'But Lindsay studied really hard. She came up with some great guesses,' the younger sister of Kylie Minogue continued.\n\n'She's generated enough column inches and interest about the show to get people interested enough to watch.'\n\nConfession: '[I've] absolutely [had to explain who the unveiled stars are to Lindsay],' Dannii said of Lindsay (pictured), 33. 'The same if we were doing the show in another country'\n\nOn Monday, media analyst Peter Cox slammed Channel Ten for bringing back Lindsay for the second season of the show in 2020.\n\nThe Mean Girls star will return to the judging panel alongside Dannii, Jackie 'O' Henderson and Dave Hughes.\n\nPeter told The Daily Telegraph's Confidential that Lindsay doesn't 'contribute anything to the show and lacks local knowledge'.\n\n'She's not able to guess who the right person is, not that it's easy, but she keeps putting up LA people who couldn't possibly be on the show.'\n\nCriticism: On Monday, media analyst Peter Cox slammed Channel Ten for bringing back Lindsay for the second season of the show in 2020, saying she 'lacks local knowledge'\n\nFeminist blog Jezebel, formerly part of the now-defunct Gawker Media company, also mocked Lindsay's skills as a celebrity guesser in an article earlier this month.\n\nA post titled 'Lindsay Lohan Has Been Unmasked as a Terrible Judge on The Masked Singer Australia' claimed that she had 'failed to identify a single Australian celebrity contestant' on the show.\n\nThis is actually incorrect, as she did correctly identify Wendell Sailor as the Rhino.\n\nThe same website also repeated The Blast's claims about Lindsay's supposed 'feud' with Jackie 'O', using the headline 'Lindsay Lohan Is Already Feuding With Someone on The Masked Singer Australia'.\n\nSet to return: The Mean Girls star will return to the judging panel alongside Dannii (second left), Jackie 'O' Henderson (far left) and Dave Hughes\n\nLindsay previously denied the reports that her diva demands were making waves behind the scenes.\n\nSpeaking on the Kyle and Jackie O Show earlier this month, Lindsay chalked the rumours up to people who were just digging for 'negativity'.\n\n'People want to find the negative for no reason. There was nothing negative about [filming The Masked Singer],' she said.\n\nJackie 'O', 44, who also co-hosts the Kyle and Jackie O Show, added that production was 'the best experience' and 'so much fun'.", "description": "Dannii Minogue, 47, weighed in on Lindsay Lohan's ability to guess identities on The Masked Singer, in an interview with The Daily Telegraph's Stellar magazine on Sunday.", "authors": ["Kristy Johnson For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/08/19912826-0-image-a-4_1571468895200.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
