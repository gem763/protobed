Smollett is still adamant that the attack was real and wasn\u2019t a publicity hoax.\n\nJudge Michael Toomin appeared to give no credence to concerns that Webb\u2019s disclosure made his position untenable as head of a politically sensitive investigation that could, depending on his findings, lead to the reinstatement of charges against Smollett.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no indication,\u201d the judge said, that the 74-year-old prosecutor-turned-star private attorney \u201charbors any bias \u2026 to any party.\u201d\n\nWebb is a consummate insider who has been sought after by a long list of rich and powerful clients, including tobacco giant Philip Morris and Ukrainian energy oligarch Dymitro Firtash. He is highly respected in legal circles.\n\nBefore Toomin ruled Friday, Webb told the judge he didn\u2019t recall the fundraiser, which he said he didn\u2019t think he attended. He also said he didn\u2019t remember cutting the check until someone brought it to his attention a week ago.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Ms. Foxx \u2026. and have never met her, as far as I know,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not even remotely a case that involves a conflict of interest.\u201d\n\nWebb\u2019s investigation includes looking into whether Foxx\u2019s calls with a Smollett relative and an ex-aide of former first lady Michelle Obama unduly influenced the decision to drop charges. Foxx recused herself from the case but continued to weigh in.\n\nA finding by the special prosecutor that the original charges against Smollett were improperly dropped could also politically damage Foxx, who in 2016 became Cook County\u2019s first black female state\u2019s attorney.\n\nA Foxx representative at Friday\u2019s hearing, prosecutor Cathy McNeil Stein, told the court her boss didn\u2019t initially have an issue with Webb staying on. But she said the state\u2019s attorney now worried that a perception Webb had a conflict \u201cwill taint the process\u201d in the eyes of the public.\n\nRetired Judge Sheila O\u2019Brien, who initiated legal action leading to a special prosecutor, agreed. She praised Webb\u2019s legal acumen but told Toomin: \u201cThe concern I have is \u2026 what does the average person on the street think?\u201d\n\nSmollett\u2019s attorneys didn\u2019t take a position on replacing Webb. They opposed the appointment of any special prosecutor, arguing the case should have stayed closed.\n\nA flyer from the fundraiser Webb included in his court filing listed him with two others as hosts of the event. Webb is a Republican, and Foxx a Democrat.\n\nIn explaining his decision not to replace Webb, Toomin cited records that Webb contributed money to state\u2019s attorneys\u2019 campaigns for years, including $3,000 to Foxx\u2019s Democratic primary opponent in 2016, incumbent Anita Alverez.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s common practice for lawyers to make (such) contributions,\u201d Toomin said.\n\nWebb echoed that in his filing, saying one reason he didn\u2019t recall the political fundraiser for Foxx is that they are so common at his high-powered Winston & Strawn law firm.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Chicago judge said Friday he won't replace a special prosecutor looking into why the state's attorney's office abruptly dismissed charges against actor Jussie Smollett, rejecting concerns that campaign money could taint the findings.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Tarm"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/jussie_smollett_29276_c0-0-3798-2214_s1770x1032.jpg?7b9038fd660d7904f45ca4f9c51f3aa12fb6304c", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
