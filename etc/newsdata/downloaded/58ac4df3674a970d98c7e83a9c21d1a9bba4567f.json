But not everyone is on board with the new proposal.\n\n\u201cI find all this ridiculous,\u201d said one woman about to hit the slopes on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s like asking Parisians not to drive on the ring road to leave room for tourists during the Christmas holidays.\u201d\n\nAt least one visitor said he thought it was a fair solution: \u201cI\u2019m OK with it \u2013 local people here have more opportunity to ski, and more often than we do.\u201d\n\nAnd many locals are also happy to comply: \u201cOf course the region lives on skiing,\u201d a waiter at a restaurant in Les Menuires explained. \u201cWe can go without and let them take our place.\u201d\n\nLast winter, France was the world\u2019s top skiing destination \u2013 ahead of the US and Austria \u2013 selling close to 54 million daily ski passes during the 2014/15 season.\n\nBut it\u2019s a title the country looks set to lose unless it gets a little more snow.", "description": "With snow in short supply this year, some French ski resorts are asking locals to stay away from the slopes and give priority to tourists.
