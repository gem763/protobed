But he is the most appropriate leader. And he is the leader for this game.\"\n\nThe match is still in jeopardy due to Typhoon Hagibis, which has already forced the cancellation of Saturday's games between England and France in Yokohama and New Zealand v Italy in Toyota City.\n\nA decision will be made by World Rugby on Sunday morning.\n\nJoseph said he had chosen his side for their big match experience, bringing back Kenki Fukuoka, who scored the match-winning try against Ireland, for Lomano Lemeki on the left wing.\n\nLemeki was man-of-the-match in Japan's 38-19 win against Samoa last weekend.\n\nFull-back William Tupou comes in for Ryohei Yamanaka, who is now on the bench in the only other change to the starting side that beat Samoa.\n\n\"We feel that we are in a good position with three wins ... (and) this is not a coincidence, it is because of hard work,\" Joseph added. \"This will be the most important test match.
