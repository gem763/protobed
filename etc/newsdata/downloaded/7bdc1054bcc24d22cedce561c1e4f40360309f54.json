Mandatory Credit: Jim Dedmon-USA TODAY Sports\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always open, I think the team is always open for a settlement,\u201d Rapinoe told Reuters on Tuesday, a day before a Women\u2019s Sports Foundation gala at which she and her 2019 World Cup-winning squad were set to be honored.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone really ever wants to go to trial or to take this thing to that level. But obviously if we have to, we will,\u201d said Rapinoe, who won the Golden Boot and Golden Ball at this year\u2019s World Cup.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not willing to compromise on what we know is right and what we know we deserve and have already earned.\u201d\n\nThe now four-times World Cup championship-winning team sued U.S. Soccer in March, alleging gender discrimination in earnings and working conditions, reigniting the issue of gender pay equity around the world.\n\nMediation between the two parties fell apart in August, and earlier this month the team pushed back in a court filing against claims by U.S. Soccer that some members earn more than their male counterparts, as they argued for class action status.\n\nNow, with a trial date set for May 2020, the team faces the prospect of preparing for the Tokyo 2020 Games with a bruising legal battle hanging over Olympic preparations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not ideal and it will take attention away and energy and effort away from what our actual job is, which is to play,\u201d said Rapinoe. \u201cThis team also is very good at multitasking and taking a lot on its plate at all times.\n\n\u201cObviously we just went to the World Cup having filed the lawsuit a couple months before and having to deal with that pressure.\u201d\n\nU.S. Soccer did not immediately respond to requests for comment but has repeatedly defended its support for the women\u2019s team in the past.\n\nRapinoe next plays on Sunday, when her team Reign FC face the North Carolina Courage in a National Women\u2019s Soccer League (NWSL) semifinal.\n\nAnd for the 34-year-old Californian, who battled back from a torn anterior cruciate ligament at the end of 2015, the chance to win her first NWSL championship during a World Cup-winning year is a tantalizing prospect after a \u201clong journey back\u201d from injury and doubt.\n\n\u201cWe all really enjoy going back to our respective club teams and having that rivalry with the other teams,\u201d said Rapinoe. \u201cI\u2019ve been to two finals and I haven\u2019t won one yet so it\u2019s kind of on the bucket list.\u201d", "description": "U.S. women's national team standout Megan Rapinoe said she's \"optimistic\" that she and her fellow players can reach an agreement in their gender discrimination suit against U.S. Soccer, but that they're also ready for a fight.", "authors": ["Amy Tennery", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441300949&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F028", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
