(Image: Thony Silas, Nelson DeCastro, and Chris Sotomayor, Marvel Comics)\n\nGhost Rider may not be making the leap to the streaming service any more but the other Marvel show that was revealed in the works for American streaming service Hulu recently just got a big shot in the arm \u2014 in part thanks to a literal Marvel.\n\nDeadline reports that Paul Zbyszewski\u2019s series about the titular supernatural Marvel character Daimon Helstrom, son of Satan, has found its main cast. This version of the series will focus around Daimon and his sister, Ana, as they use their chaotically supernatural abilities and connection to the underworld to \u201cpursue the world\u2019s vilest of the vile \u2014 with some family drama of their own.\u201d After all, you can\u2019t tell a story about the children of Hell without a bit of family drama, right?\n\nFilling the fiery footsteps of Daimon and Ana will be Grantchester\u2019s Tom Austen and Fear the Walking Dead\u2019s Sydney Lemmon, respectively. Austen\u2019s Daimon is described as \u201ca professor of ethics who moonlights as an exorcist,\u201d concerned less about saving the world from demonic threats as he is safeguarding those closest to him as he relentlessly pursues his demon foes. Lemmon\u2019s Ana, meanwhile, is a ruthless auction house manager by day, \u201cbut her true interest lies in hunting down those who hurt others,\u201d working with her brother to stop their father\u2019s potential return.\n\nFilling out the human side of the Helstrom family is Daimon and Ana\u2019s mother, Victoria Helstrom. Played by Homeland\u2019s Elizabeth Marvel, Victoria has spent two decades being institutionalised after being \u201cplagued by demons both real and imagined,\u201d and hopes to repair her fractured relationship with her children.\n\nThe main cast is rounded out by June Carryl, Ariana Guerra, Alain Uy and Robert Wisdom. Carryl plays Dr. Louise Hastings, the psychologist in charge of Victoria Helstrom\u2019s psychiatric care \u201cwith a strong faith but an open mind,\u201d who has come to act as a family friend to the Helstroms, including helping Daimon with his anti-demon adventures.\n\nGuerra plays Gabriella Rosetti \u2014 an agent of the Vatican dispatched to help Daimon and Hastings uncover acts of demonic interference in the world \u2014 while on Ana\u2019s side of the family, Uy plays Chris Yen, Ana\u2019s business partner at the auction house and a \u201csurrogate brother,\u201d aiding her Ana as a loyal friend and assistant. Lastly, Wisdom plays a character only dubbed as \u201cCaretaker:\u201d a \u201cguardian of knowledge of the occult\u201d who Ana turns to to help go on her own demon-hunting escapades.\n\nHelstrom, which has just begun production, currently doesn\u2019t have a scheduled release date.
