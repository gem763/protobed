The video includes a moment where the 22-year-old entrepreneur wakes up her daughter Stormi by turning on the lights and cheerfully singing \"Rise and Shine.\"\n\nThat clip went viral, but the biggest reaction of all came from Grande herself.\n\nThe \"Boyfriend\" singer posted an adorable plea to her Instagram Stories on Wednesday, complete with the sparkly eyes filter, asking Kylie if she could sample the \"Rise and Shine\" lyric. She also covered the three-second song.\n\nAriana Grande reenacts Kylie Jenner\u2019s viral \u201crise and shine\u201d meme in new Instagram story:\n\n\n\n\u201ccan i sample\u201d pic.twitter.com/MyJSi2UYhO \u2014 Pop Crave (@PopCrave) October 17, 2019\n\nKylie responded on her Instagram Stories and happily gave Grande the green light.\n\nBut, there was a catch -- she has to be in the music video.\n\nIt would mark the latest collaboration between Grande and the Jenners.
