We Taste-Tested Them", "language": "en", "text": "In just two years, food technology has moved consumers from browsing for wan \u201cveggie patties\u201d in the frozen aisle to selecting fresh \u201cplant-based burgers\u201d sold next to the ground beef.\n\nBehind the scenes at the supermarket, giant battles are being waged: Meat producers are suing to have the words \u201cmeat\u201d and \u201cburger\u201d restricted to their own products. Makers of meat alternatives like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods are vying to capture the global fast-food market, as big players like Tyson and Perdue join the fray. Environmental and food scientists are insisting that we eat more plants and less processed food. Many vegetarians and vegans say the goal is to break the habit of eating meat, not feed it with surrogates.\n\n\u201cI would still prefer to eat something that\u2019s not lab-grown,\u201d said Isa Chandra Moskowitz, the chef at the vegan restaurant Modern Love in Omaha, where her own burger is the most popular dish on the menu. \u201cBut it\u2019s better for people and for the planet to eat one of those burgers instead of meat every day, if that\u2019s what they are going to do anyway.\u201d\n\nThe new refrigerator-case \u201cmeat\u201d products already comprise one of t he fastest-growing segments of the food industry.", "description": "The new generation of veggie burgers aims to replace the beefy original with fake meat or fresher vegetables.
