Through our free trade agreements with both the US and China, Australian exporters are well positioned to continue to enjoy strong access to sell goods and services in both markets.\"\n\nSoy beans and pork have been nominated as the main commodities China will buy from US growers. Official data shows the US exported $US12 billion of soybeans to China in 2017, while Australia's exports were just $US136,000. US pork exports totalled $US237 million while Australia sent no pork to China.\n\n'Relationships at stake'\n\nHowever, Senator Wong will warn there is no way to be confident the partial trade deal will lead to a resolution of the bigger issues and that the deal will protect Australian interests.\n\n\"It is important now for Scott Morrison to demonstrate that Australian farmers won\u2019t be worse off under the deal struck between the US and China,\" Senator Wong will tell an Australian Institute of International Affairs conference on Monday.\n\nSenator Wong will use her speech to launch into her strongest criticism of Mr Morrison's approach to foreign policy, saying he is exploiting complexities for political advantage at a time China is becoming harder to handle because of its \"increasing assertiveness\" under President Xi Jinping.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe will say Mr Morrison has echoed Beijing's talking points by labelling scrutiny of first-term MP Gladys Liu as a smear against all Chinese Australians.\n\nShe will also say Mr Morrison blundered by airing concerns over China's developing nation status in the US after attending a Trump rally, playing into Chinese concerns Australia was a US pawn.\n\nSenator Wong will say Mr Morrison's first foray into foreign policy \u2013 when he announced a review of Middle East policy on the eve of the byelection in Wentworth, which has a significant Jewish population \u2013 was an early harbinger of his style.\n\n\"There\u2019s no doubt Scott Morrison is the best political tactician in Australia right now,\" Senator Wong will say according to speech notes.\n\n\"Is it enough to be a clever political tactician, when key relationships with our nearest neighbours are at stake?\"", "description": "Opposition foreign affairs spokeswoman Penny Wong will use a speech on Monday to air her strongest criticism of Prime Minister Scott Morrison's approach to foreign policy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4119%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_49%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/11004ef03e3375923d23aeea08a9e0013652132d", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
