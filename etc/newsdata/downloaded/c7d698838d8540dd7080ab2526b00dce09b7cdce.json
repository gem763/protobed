I do not see the men and women of law enforcement sworn to uphold the U.S. Constitution doing this,\" Ferrari continued.\"In an act of desperation, Mr. O\u2019Rourke is shamefully using tragedies our country has experienced and fear for his political gain. The very foundation of law enforcement is public trust. Frankly, no one should trust a man who talks out of both sides of his mouth.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure whether his statements are naive or just plain ignorant and arrogant. Maybe it's all three,\" said Eddy County Sheriff Mark Cage. \"The thought of anyone utilizing my sheriff's office or any other law enforcement agency in this country as their personal Gestapo to go door to door violating citizen's rights is disgusting, unrealistic and downright un-American.\"\n\nCage is concerned if any law enforcement agency participates in O'Rourke's plan on a large scale, \"bloodshed would be inevitable,\" adding that \"some of my constituents are already adopting the mantra of 'Come take mine Beto!'...His rhetoric has gotten old and I look forward to the day when he shuts up.\"\n\nWeld County Sheriff Steve Reams told Towhnall he also would have concerns for the safety of his deputies because it would be an \"unconstitutional\" order and would put them \"in the crosshairs.\"\n\n\"I think that you have to be concerned for the safety of the citizen [too] because, at that point, they don't know if law enforcement is coming to protect them or disarm them and that creates a very tense situation.\"\n\nReams said he does not know how a candidate would think they would be able to order local police to carry out confiscation if they became president, adding, \"I think [Beto] is sorely mistaken if he thinks law enforcement is going to willingly agree to go down that path.\"\n\nCommenting on the backlash that followed after O'Rourke's comments on Wednesday, Lauren Hitt, his national rapid response director, maintained he would not \"send officers door to door to collect weapons - just as we do not send the IRS door to door to collect taxes.\"\n\nWhile sheriffs are more willing to oppose gun control laws they deem as being unconstitutional, some law enforcement organizations, such as the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), have voiced support for an \"assault weapons\" ban.\n\nIACP did not return Townhall's request for comment on O'Rourke's proposal.", "description": ".10/19/2019 6:46:53AM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/266/01c44d5e-eb6d-4d92-9297-0e1c7ae1cd4c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
