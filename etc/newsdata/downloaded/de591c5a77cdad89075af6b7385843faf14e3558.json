Morrisons suffers first quarterly sales fall since 2016\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Morrisons (L: ), Britain's No. 4 grocer, reported its first fall in quarterly underlying sales since 2016 on Thursday, partly reflecting a tough comparison with last year when it was boosted by a hot summer.\n\nThe company, however, said it had maintained momentum in its turnaround plan and had seen \"robust progress\" in sales and profit, with the latter rising 5.3% in its first half.\n\nFor the six months to Aug. 4, the Bradford, northern England, based company made an pretax profit before one-off items of 198 million pounds. That compared to analysts' average forecast of 192 million pounds and 188 million pounds made in the same period last year.\n\nGroup like-for-like sales, excluding fuel and VAT sales tax, fell 1.9% in its second quarter, having increased 2.3% in the first quarter. Analysts had on average forecast a 2.0% fall.\n\nSecond-quarter trading had faced tough comparisons with a year earlier, when sales were boosted by the hot weather, a royal wedding and the soccer World Cup. The fall followed 14 straight quarters of growth.\n\nMorrisons, however, said it expected retail like-for-like sales to improve in the second half.\n\nThe retailer said it was extending its partnership in Britain with online giant Amazon (O: ) by signing a multi-year agreement rather than the current rolling contract.\n\nShares in Morrisons, which trails market leader Tesco (L: ), Sainsbury's (L: ) and Walmart's (N: ) Asda in annual sales, have fallen 27% over the last year as its sales growth has slowed. They closed Wednesday at 194 pence, valuing the business at 4.66 billion pounds.\n\nIt will pay a special dividend of 2 pence a share, taking its interim payout to 3.93 pence a share.\n\nPrior to Thursday's update analysts were on average forecasting a full year 2018-19 pretax profit of 415 million pounds, up from 396 million pounds in 2017-18.", "description": "Morrisons suffers first quarterly sales fall since 2016", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED090D3_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
