In fact, it said, \u201call that is left for him is to resign. Unfortunately, he has repeatedly shown over the past few months that law and order are of little interest to him.\u201d\n\nThere may never have been a British prime minister who has sought to overrule the primacy of parliament like Johnson, the paper said, \u201ca prime minister who has lied to the people, parliament and the crown, and abuses his power without a care\u201d.\n\nJohnson is simply \u201cnot the right person to lead Britain in such a major crisis\u201d, it concluded. \u201cIf Brexit is not done legally and in accordance with the constitution, Britain will never find peace. The people must now decide what they want, either in the form of new elections or a second referendum.\u201d\n\nDie Welt said the judges\u2019 decision had \u201cerupted like a volcano\u201d. Johnson, defeated multiple times in parliament, had now lost, heavily, before the law. \u201cOne wonders whether and how he can continue, at the head of a minority government and discredited by the supreme court,\u201d it said.\n\nHandelsblatt said the judges\u2019 verdict was \u201ccrushing, and unanimous\u201d. The court\u2019s reasoning was laid out with \u201cincorruptible, merciless logic and in the end, its verdict seemed inevitable \u2013 and the government\u2019s argument was pulverised\u201d.\n\nAbove and beyond the consequences for Johnson and Brexit, the ruling showed Britain needs a written constitution. \u201cOtherwise unscrupulous leaders like Johnson can abuse it anytime. Parliament must be able to decide for itself when it meets.\u201d\n\nIn a stinging editorial, the Irish Times said a central plank of Johnson\u2019s \u201ccarefully cultivated self-image\u201d had always been the claim that \u201cbehind the buffoonish exterior was a skilful, serious-minded tactician \u2026 But in just two months in Downing St, that illusion has unravelled. Johnson, it is painfully clear, is winging it.\u201d\n\nThe paper said the ruling was his \u201cbiggest humiliation of all\u201d. The judges had \u201cbroken new constitutional ground\u201d with their \u201cpowerful assertion of parliamentary sovereignty and robust rebuke to those who trample on it\u201d, and their decision had left Johnson \u201cbacked into a corner, his options narrowing and his time running out.\u201d.\n\nIn France, Le Monde said the word \u201chistoric\u201d was no exaggeration: \u201cThe supreme court has taken a decision that will stay long in the annals of British politics,\u201d it said. Certainly, the ruling was \u201ca monumental blow to Boris Johnson, whose authority now seems seriously weakened\u201d.\n\nBut beyond that, in a country without a written constitution, the court\u2019s 11 judges \u201cmade history by considerably reinforcing British parliamentary democracy, and defining very clearly the balance of powers between parliament and government\u201d.\n\nThe paper said the decision made the prospect of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October even more unlikely. \u201cHow, after such a heavy judicial defeat, could Johnson defy the law obliging him to seek a delay if there is no agreement with Brussels by 18 October?\u201d\n\nLib\u00e9ration said the most likely scenario now was probably \u201ca vote of no confidence leading to fresh elections and, of course, to a new Brexit delay\u201d. Johnson, however, is still insisting that the UK \u201cwill leave the EU on 31 October, come what may\u201d.\n\nBritish prime ministers, the paper said, \u201chave all, these past three years, been afflicted with the same syndrome: that of endlessly repeating the same empty phrases without ever resolving Brexit \u2013 whose outcome, despite all the political drama, has still not been found.\u201d\n\nSpain\u2019s El Pa\u00eds said in an editorial an \u201cautocratic and populist ruler\u201d had been severely admonished for attacking parliamentary democracy. The 11 supreme court judges had done \u201cgreat service to the cause of democracy, far beyond the borders of their small Atlantic island\u201d, it said.\n\nIn the Netherlands, De Volkskrant said \u201cfew had expected such a unanimous and harsh judgement, which was hailed as a victory for the rule of law\u201d. Johnson and his top adviser, Dominic Cummings, had been reminded in no uncertain terms by 11 judges that their \u201cpeople versus the established order\u201d strategy \u201cmay work for a campaign like Vote Leave, but running a country is different\u201d, it said.\n\nBut, the paper added, the judges\u2019 spectacular statement was \u201cnot a solution to the political crisis\u201d. The prime minister has no majority in parliament, but \u201cat the same time, parliament is reluctant to let the government fall for fear of new elections and the risk that the UK will fall out of the EU without a deal\u201d.", "description": "Die Zeit says PM should resign, while De Volkskrant cautions that ruling was not a solution to the UK\u2019s crisis", "authors": ["Jon Henley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cea77e7a31588ff264bd84c354f85ab67e775c10/0_84_4033_2419/master/4033.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=262a014a09ab59b5a1a57cac253d5eb4", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
