He lives in London with his wife Sheila Ferris. They have two children, Robert, 38, and Katherine, 36.\n\nGrowing up, I lived in a secular home. My mum was Anglican, but not a churchgoer. My father, who was Jewish, from Cape Town, gave up his faith before I was born.\n\nAs a young actor, I'd look at my reflection and study the sort of person I was: I'm short and stocky, and have a deep voice and an olive complexion \u2014 not the typical Brit. I wondered how I would fit into a British society and its arts.\n\nAfter graduating from drama school, aged 23, in 1970, I experienced a long period of unemployment and was going to give up acting.\n\nActor David Suchet, 73, said he would often look at his reflection as a young actor and wondered how he would fit into a British society and its arts\n\nI worked for Moss Bros, the suit and shirt makers, in Covent Garden. I did so well that chairman Monty Moss invited me to meet him to discuss a management position. Then the most extraordinary thing happened.\n\nWhen I arrived to see Monty, I was told to make an urgent phone call to a man called Barry Ford. It turned out he was my agent \u2014 I'd forgotten him, as we hadn't spoken in more than a year. He offered me a small TV role. So I never met Mr Moss. That moment changed my life.\n\nSoon after, I joined the Royal Shakespeare Company and stayed until 1986. I found I had a natural ability to be a chameleon, to change myself into different people \u2014 and the world of character acting opened up to me. I was never asked just to be me.\n\nAt 43, I was offered the role of Poirot. I remember my brother, John, said that with my classical theatre background, I shouldn't touch it with a bargepole!\n\nYet what Poirot did for me, surprisingly, was to open up other high-profile character roles in TV and theatre. I may not have been offered these without it.\n\nIn hindsight, he is pleased he didn't fit into any British or celebrity stereotype as it allowed him to have a rewarding career, playing different people\n\nWhen I knew I'd never play him again, after his death in Curtain: Poirot's Last Case, it felt like I was losing a dear friend.\n\nIn hindsight, I'm so pleased I didn't fit into any British or celebrity stereotype. This has afforded me the most wonderful and rewarding career, playing different people. And, above all, it's taught me not to act the star. Don't put yourself on a pedestal \u2014 always keep both feet on the ground.\n\nBehind The Lens: My Life by David Suchet (\u00a325, Constable) is out now.", "description": "Actor David Suchet, 73, said he would often look at his reflection as a young actor and wonder how he would fit into a British society and its arts.", "authors": ["Florence Scordoulis For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/19/20252864-0-image-a-12_1572204833394.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
