It hit the 29-seat threshold early on Thursday \u2013 the number needed for any party to have its presidential candidate declared the winner.\n\nMasisi sounded impressed with the BDP\u2019s parliamentary candidate who was pitted against the UDC\u2019s Boko for the Gaborone Bonnington North constituency.\n\nNot only did the UDC drop in performance, but Boko also failed to win his own constituency: the BDP\u2019s Anna Mokgethi beat him soundly, garnering 3 033 votes against his 1 851.\n\nMasisi said Mokgethi had \u201csent dear Advocate Boko where he belongs\u201d.\n\nBDP\u2019S IMPROVED PERFORMANCE\n\nMasisi said his party had done well in that it had also succeeded in winning all four wards in the country\u2019s South Region, which has historically been in the hands of the opposition.\n\nThe same goes for the Gaborone region.\n\n\u201cElection results were telling \u2026 and the one I take my hat off to particularly is our ability, after many dry decades, of taking political charge of our capital city, Gaborone,\u201d said Masisi.\n\n\u201cWe hit the 38 mark and our popular vote, despite the challenges we had, has increased significantly above what we had in 2014. It is also extremely pleasing that we are in charge of the overwhelming majority of local councils in this country.\n\n\u201cResults were also revealing in that the patterns of voting were indicative of the thirst that people wished to quench. And, perhaps surprisingly to some \u2013 not us \u2013 we swept the stakes in places that are traditionally homes to the opposition.\u201d\n\nMasisi added that he believed the BDP could have performed even better had it not been for some drama in the lead-up to elections.\n\nHe may have been referring to his very public fallout with Khama and his brother, Tshekedi Khama, and their subsequent departure from the party.\n\n\u201cIt was through strategic intervention and hard work that we won,\u201d said Masisi, \u201cand had it not been for the unfortunate circumstances in which we found ourselves, wherein we were divided before the elections, the BDP would have run right over the opposition.\u201d\n\nAs Masisi assumes his post for a new five-year term, after holding the fort for 18 months when Khama\u2019s constitutional two five-year terms lapsed, the country sees a BDP divided and a former president in conflict with the incumbent.\n\nREBUILDING BOTSWANA\n\nThe two men\u2019s public bickering, marred by accusations prior to the election, bore signs of an irreparable relationship.\n\nAsked if he was willing to open his arms to Khama and Boko, another fierce critic, Masisi responded by dismissing all the bitter pre-election utterances as \u201cjust the nature of politics\u201d.\n\nHe said he was going to restart his presidency by hitting the ground running, adding that he had told BDP officials \u201cnot to celebrate for long\u201d because promises contained in the party\u2019s manifesto were waiting to be delivered.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, the BDP is going to strengthen itself as an organisation, enhance our capabilities and sharpen our abilities to deliver. We have no time to celebrate. We will do so a little, and then it is back to hard work,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe will not be shy to go outside and get help from our friends. I would like to note that there are many friends out there who are willing to be of genuine assistance to us, and we will utilise every opportunity that we have.\u201d\n\nBOKO NOT SAYING MUCH\n\nOpposition leader Boko appeared to have gone to ground after the election results, saying little of the election outcome that saw his party take a hard knock.\n\nAsked by City Press yesterday whether his party would work with Masisi, Boko would say only this: \u201cI will be in South Africa on Sunday and will traverse all these and other issues. You will be informed and are invited. Details [of the media briefing] will be communicated\u201d.\n\nBotswana is preparing to get back to work and schools will reopen on Monday.\n\nThis after a three-day hiatus, Masisi having declared Wednesday to Friday to be public holidays.\n\nPreparations are currently under way for Masisi\u2019s inauguration, which is scheduled to take place this week.", "description": "After a bitter campaign marred by his feud with predecessor Ian Khama, BDP leader\u2019s landslide victory may signal more of the same.", "authors": ["Poloko Tau"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9523/59c3339b142a4614af47e412c83626c0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
