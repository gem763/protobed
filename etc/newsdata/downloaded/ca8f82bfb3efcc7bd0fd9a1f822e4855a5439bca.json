(Talia Ricci/CBC)\n\nOn the trips south of the border, he grabbed a sample of the dirt from each field, which is now proudly displayed in his home.\n\n\"I think they're all kind of unique in their own way and they all have their own special architectural details. I pay attention to that.\"\n\nThe 43-year-old says he doesn't have a favorite, but he considers Comerica Park his home stadium, growing up in Windsor, Ont., and attending Tigers games in Detroit. But still, he says nothing quite compares to watching a baseball game in Japan.\n\nTiffin says the Rogers Centre dirt sample was the toughest to collect because it's a turf field, but he got lucky when the stadium hosted an event where they were giving away samples to fans. (Russ Tiffin/Submitted)\n\n\"I fell in love with it right away,\" he said.\n\n\"Not to say the fans aren't passionate here, but they're just so into it in Japan. They sing along to every player when they're at bat. They have their unique customs they celebrate throughout the game. They have their own cheering sections for each team.\"\n\nTiffin said the decade long trip didn't come without its challenges. He did it all on a shoestring budget taking overnight bus rides across the border \u2014 sometimes being held up by bad weather or cancellations.\n\nTiffin also completes a 'hot dog report' at every stadium sharing the price of a beer and hot dog with his followers. (Russ Tiffin/Instagram)\n\nAfter the long journey, he said, he's going to take a bit of a break from the baseball travel.\n\n\"It was a dream of mine. I'm glad I got to accomplish it.\"", "description": "From Phoenix, Ariz., to Tokyo, one Torontonian has completed a journey to dozens of major-league baseball stadiums on a shoestring budget.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5296936.1569436844!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/japan-baseball.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
