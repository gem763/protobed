Its search function can now handle more complex inquiries through a new sequence of code called Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers\u2014or Bert\u2014that uses advanced machine learning. It\u2019ll improve one in 10 queries, Google said. (Wall Street Journal)\n\nTalking point: Google executives claim the changes are among the biggest improvements to search in five years. Previously, queries with slang or words that have multiple meanings would confuse the search engine, which would interpret them literally or bring up irrelevant results. Bert is intended to overcome those issues, partially by ignoring unnecessary words like transitions. Google\u2019s search capabilities are at the centre of its digital ad business, which makes US$136 billion a year. The company doesn\u2019t share the exact number of searches it receives per day, but some estimates place the figure at 3.5 billion. That means Bert could be improving some 350 million queries a day.", "description": "", "authors": ["Hanna Lee"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
