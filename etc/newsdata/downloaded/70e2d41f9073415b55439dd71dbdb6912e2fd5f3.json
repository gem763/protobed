There were more than 200 demonstrations across the UK.\n\nJake Woodier, who campaigns for the Student Climate Network, which co-organised the event, said it marked a turning point in the fight to tackle the climate crisis.\n\n\u201cMillions of people across the globe, and hundreds of thousands across the UK, have sent a clear message about the need for urgent climate action,\u201d he said from the protest in central London.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A protester in Cardiff, Wales.

She said: \u201cI am so fearful for the future. I feel totally powerless \u2013 but here, together we have a chance to get our voice heard and force action.\u201d\n\nEmma Beresford, 14, was with her younger brother, Archie, and their mother, Anna. She said: \u201cI went on the march for a people\u2019s vote for Brexit but climate change is an even more urgent and pressing issue than anything else.\u201d\n\nJeremy Corbyn and Green MP Caroline Lucas addressed the crowd in London, with the Labour leader promising a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d \u2013 a version of the Green New Deal \u2013 to tackle the climate crisis and create hundreds of thousands of well paid unionised jobs.\n\nPlay Video 1:23 'Pollution knows no borders': Jeremy Corbyn addresses London climate strike \u2013 video\n\nHowever, the schools minister, Nick Gibb, struck a different note earlier in the day when he said the cause \u2013 which he said he supported \u2013 did not warrant missing school. That advice was ignored by hundreds of thousands of people across the UK.\n\nIn Edinburgh, a huge crowd marched from the Meadows, down the Royal Mile to the Scottish parliament. They were clapped and cheered by onlookers, saluted by a bagpiper and entertained by a percussion drummer and jazz bands.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A student dressed as a bear takes to the streets, in Manchester. Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA\n\nChants of \u201cHey hey, ho ho, climate change has got to go!\u201d filled the streets of the Scottish capital along with tens of thousands of people, bearing banners that were both funny and dark: \u201c33.2C in Scotland. Time to panic!\u201d, \u201cSea levels are rising. So are we!\u201d, \u201cYou\u2019ll die of old age. I\u2019ll die of climate change.\u201d\n\n\n\nRuby, 10, and Dougie, seven, have been ahead of the shift in public opinion. They were inspired by Greta Thunberg to start striking outside the Scottish parliament on a cold day in January.\n\n\u201cThere was only me and my brother there and the police. The next week there was one more, and eventually loads of people, and now there is this,\u201d Ruby said, gesturing to the vast procession that stretched back as far as the eye could see. \u201cI\u2019m happy and proud.\u201d\n\nThe climate crisis explained in 10 charts Read more\n\nHer younger brother said the demonstration was \u201cabsolutely amazing\u201d. The seven-year-old was among those due to give a speech outside the Scottish legislature. His message to politicians was straightforward: \u201cThey are trying their hardest but they need to try lots harder.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn Manchester the square outside the city\u2019s grand central library was taken over by a sea of people carrying homemade placards and demanding change.\n\nThe city\u2019s mayor, Andy Burnham, received a warm applause at the protest when he gave a speech pledging that \u201cfracking is the past, it is not the future\u201d \u2013 but by far the biggest cheers went to a 10-year-old girl called Lillia who took to the stage next.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Young climate strikers in Birmingham.

Lies, when we have 1,200 air pollution-related deaths in Manchester just last year \u2013 but they plan to build a huge car park right next door to a school in Ancoats.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, in Birmingham demonstrators staged a die-in outside the BBC offices in the city to protest at what they said was inadequate coverage of the climate crisis.\n\nSimilar actions were staged at an Oxford University open day for prospective students and by 3,000 Cambridge residents in King\u2019s Parade in the city.\n\nOne of those taking part in the Oxford protest, Ell Ludlow, said: \u201cWe are doing this because we feel like a world leading university should lead on climate. Oxford is not doing that at the moment and so we want them to act now.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Andrew Bevan, 29, of Cardiff, brought Rico, a six-year-old rescue dog, to the protest in Whitehall, London.

We have to support them, speak out with them for their future.
