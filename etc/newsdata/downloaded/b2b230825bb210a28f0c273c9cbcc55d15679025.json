My target was to try to find the best way to win the race,\u201d said the 26-year-old who also produced a late burst to win the same race last year.\n\nIt was a stunning performance by the Spaniard who crashed on both Friday and Saturday. It was Marquez\u2019s ninth win of the season, which propelled him to his eighth world title with a total of 325 points, putting him beyond Dovizioso\u2019s reach at 215 points with four races remaining this season.\n\n\u201cFabio was really fast in most parts of the race. I wasn\u2019t able to grab the lead in the middle of the race. I caught up in the last lap and took it from there. It\u2019s been an amazing year. It\u2019s now time for me to enjoy and celebrate the eighth title,\u201d added Marquez who has won titles in 2010, 2012-14, 2016-19.\n\nIn another dominating year, Marquez has finished on the podium 14 times in 2019.\n\nThe 20-year-old rookie Quartaroro, the youngest to secure four pole positions in a season including Sunday\u2019s race, appeared to be on his way to a maiden victory before the late charge from Marquez.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say anything except that I\u2019m so proud of the work of my team and myself. I couldn\u2019t be happier as I fought until the last corner. I already tried everything. If I didn\u2019t try to make a move in the last corner, I would have gone up unhappy. My time will come,\u201d said the French rider who had to settle for second for the third time this year.\n\nHe finished in a time of 39 minutes and 36.394 seconds with Maverick Vinales of Spain third just over a second behind. Dovizioso just missed out on a podium finish in fourth.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Marc Marquez of Spain passed Fabio Quartararo of France on the last lap to win the Thailand Grand Prix and clinch his eighth MotoGP world title at the Chang International Circuit on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/thailand_motogp_50796_c0-168-3738-2347_s1770x1032.jpg?de15d094471bd55739fd526a30c8bfefdf6699e5", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
