Here's how she got her money and life in order", "language": "en", "text": "Since as long as Abigail Ness can remember, she's been good at tidying up. Although Ness, 34, is employed as a research analyst at a local bank in Nampa, Idaho, she has spent the last seven years dreaming of becoming a professional organizer. But before she could launch a business helping other people, Ness recognized she needed to get her own finances in order. So over the last three years, she has paid off $43,500 in debt. Those debts included $36,000 in student loans, with interest rates averaging 5.9%, from earning an undergraduate degree in communications at Boise State University. She had also racked up $3,000 in credit card debt during and after college, at an interest rate of 11%. In addition, Ness owed $9,500 on her car, with an interest rate of 3%. \"I realized I wasn't passionate about the companies that were getting all of my hard-earned money,\" Ness explains. She made it her mission to use her earnings to become debt-free and then pursue a new profession.\n\nThe anti-debt strategy: Straightening up to spend less\n\nBathroom organization before and after. Abigail Ness\n\nNess also took stock of her food pantry and toiletries. She determined which food staples she could start buying for less. And, after sifting through her bathroom, she realized she was often buying products like shampoo before finishing what she already had. She started transferring her toiletries to clear bottles with labels so she would use every last drop and only buy what she ran out of. \"I made it my mission to be resourceful with the things I already own,\" Ness explains. Shopping for off-brand products at grocery stores and cooking for herself, rather than dining out, saved Ness over $150 a month, while swapping out expensive toiletries saved her over $70 a month. She also applied her visual organizational strategy to her money, clearly outlining what she would use each dollar for: \"There was no hiding money. I would use it for everything that was on the budget. I wouldn't just let it be a free-for-all.\" Creating a visual of where her money was going helped her recognize how much of her income was wasted in interest. To avoid spending on borrowing, Ness used a balance transfer to move her credit card debt from an account with 11% interest to one that charged zero interest.\n\nThe debt-free celebration: Building family memories\n\nWhen Ness made her final student loan payment in April, she officially became debt-free. In all, she paid off $43,500 in student loan, auto loan, and credit card debt. (Ness's parents helped her move towards financial freedom a bit faster by contributing $5,000 towards her student debt, but their contribution isn't reflected in that total.) In May, Ness says she indulged her inner child and took her two younger sisters to Disneyland in California to celebrate her financial freedom.\n\nThe opportunity: Launching 'Organized by Abi'", "description": "Abigail Ness of Nampa, Idaho, applied her passion for organization to her life and her finances and was able to wipe away $43,500 in debt in three years. \"I made it my mission to be resourceful with the things I already own,\" she says.", "authors": ["Sofia Pitt"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106074740-1565635409813img_7120.jpg?v=1565646222", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
