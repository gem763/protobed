Do they sound big or small, male or female, old or young? Is their voice strong, emotive, controlled?\n\nAs singer Deni Hines said when unmasked last week: \u201cWith this, it was purely the voice.\u201d\n\nThe sound of the voice \u2013 referred to as vocal quality or vocal timbre in singing \u2013 is highly characteristic and distinctive.\n\nMaking noise\n\nA number of factors contribute to each singer\u2019s individual vocal quality.\n\nBody shape plays a role, impacting the length of our vocal tract, the size and shape of our resonating chambers (the mouth, chest, and nasal cavity) and articulators (the lips, teeth, tongue, jaw and palate) and our lung capacity for breath.\n\nOur voice changes with age, narrowing in frequency and dynamic range.\n\nThese variables affect how high and low one can sing, the quality of their timbre, and dynamic range.\n\nSociety and culture also influence vocal quality. A singer\u2019s speaking style can impact on their vocal quality, especially in popular and contemporary music styles.\n\nVocalists have a long history of methodically altering their singing style to achieve desired vocal effects such as the twang of country and western or the vibrato of opera.\n\nListen up\n\nListeners respond to a large number of vocal cues in predictable ways.\n\nTake emotion. Vocalisations are heavily influenced by a person\u2019s emotions. This has been examined in linguistics, where emotion in vocalisations have been reliably decoded across listeners and emotion has been found to influence emotional perception of words.\n\nSimilar results have also been found in singing, with listeners reliably decoding and having their perception of lyrics impacted by emotional content in vocal quality.\n\nIn my research, my colleague and I presented 20 listeners with happy and sad vocal timbres followed by happy and sad words. Participants heard words in matched conditions (happy vocal timbre with happy word), and mismatched conditions (happy vocal timbre with sad word). We then asked participants to judge as quickly as possible if the word they heard was happy or sad.\n\nThe results showed timbre conveys emotional meaning and were consistent for the listeners studied.\n\nOne reason for such vocal cues being so salient is because of the multitude of physiological mechanisms used by speakers and singers. One famous example of this is our ability to hear a smile.\n\nBody language (in this case, smiling) impacts vocal quality by altering body shape (tightening muscles that shorten the length of vocal tract, altering the tension of the vocal chords and shape of resonating chambers).\n\nA second reason is singing is closely linked to our everyday experience of vocalisations. When listening to a singer, we feel we know what to do.\n\nListeners have a lived experience of how it feels to produce vocal sounds and may unknowingly embody this lived experience when hearing a vocal performance.\n\nRight on cue\n\nOne frame of reference we use when interpreting a singer\u2019s vocal cues is called ecological listening. Listeners respond to vocal cues because they have a plethora of everyday vocal experiences on which to draw.\n\nListeners go beyond the literal meaning of words; understanding a tremulous voice might signal distress or a rough vocal quality might convey anger. The precision and flexibility of this send-and-receive dynamic is highly evolved in human communication compared to other species.\n\nAudiences of The Masked Singer reliably draw information from the voice such as likely physical characteristics or emotional state. The show also reveals another layer of meaning attributed to the voice \u2013 identity.\n\nWhen Adam Brand was revealed as the Dragon on The Masked Singer, news articles explained the chest infection behind Brand\u2019s \u201cless than stellar critiques from the judges\u201d. Such explanations were necessary because Brand did not sound as we expected a singer to sound.\n\nSongbirds\n\nChanges in a singer\u2019s voice alter listeners\u2019 perception of them. This plays out in the careers of the ageing superstars, who \u2013 thanks to long term vocal strain and ageing voice (presbyphonia) \u2013 find it increasingly difficult to stage performances that live up to the legacy of their recordings.\n\nDuring their recent tour of Australia, Stevie Nicks and Christine McVin\u2019s vocals with Fleetwood Mac were described as lacking the \u201cvocal ranges of their younger selves\u201d.\n\nWhether it be Brand\u2019s dragon-costumed performances on television or Fleetwood Mac\u2019s live tour 50 years after their inception, a singer\u2019s vocal quality plays a key role in our understanding of their identity.\n\nThe Masked Singer demonstrates the distinctive and evocative nature of the voice, highlighting the weight ascribed to vocal timbre and identity. This is just as important for guessing the identity of a masked celebrity as it is for us in our everyday lives.\n\nKristal Spreadborough, Casual Academic, University of New England\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.
