He had two trucks of gear on hire, two bl**dy great trucks full of stuff, but no gigs booked. And then they were sort of ringing round little venues going: \u201cCan we come and do your gig tomorrow?\u201d It was absolute chaos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018If you\u2019ve already got the sold out show and then Prince rings you up 10 o\u2019clock the morning before, it\u2019s very difficult to just go \u201cYeah, alright. I\u2019ll just tell 800 people to p**s off.\u201d It\u2019s not as easy as it seems, even though it\u2019s Prince.\n\n\u2018They\u2019d already cancelled on us at the last minute before and they started talking to us on Friday afternoon for a Monday Night Show. So we were like no, actually, considering there\u2019s a 50% chance you will change your mind on Sunday afternoon, you can do the Late Show.\u2019\n\nWhen they locked the date in, Prince set about redecorating the venue with his own equipment for the night. Simon explained: \u2018In the end he had all his kit upstairs, he insisted on bringing his own PA in, which is utterly unnecessary in this venue.\n\nKate Moss was seen getting engulfed by paparazzi as she left Prince\u2019s gig (Picture: GC Images)\n\n\u2018And then he had to bring in his own mixing desk which is about as wide as a sofa, which was also totally unnecessary. And all this stuff was upstairs ready to go, so as soon as the downstairs show finished we had to clear the room and then all these people came bowling in and dressed the stage, put his logo up and he still managed to fit two shows in!\u2019\n\nOf course, seeing Prince in such a close-up setting is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so fans began queuing up from the early morning outside the venue, despite there only being a limited amount of spaces inside.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLocal businesses helped them get in the mood for The Purple One by projecting Prince videos (at full volume) on the building opposite, as the fans waited in the rain for news whether they could make it inside to either show.\n\nBRITDOC keeping the queues of ppl waiting for #prince at #ronniescotts entertained with a projection of the wee fella pic.twitter.com/5ABM3xIFC7 \u2014 TheDocSociety (@TheDocSociety) February 17, 2014\n\nSimon revealed: \u2018The queue started at eight o\u2019clock in the morning outside the club. They knew they couldn\u2019t just buy a ticket and come back because [Prince\u2019s team] didn\u2019t tell us till half past five in the afternoon how much they wanted to charge for the show.\n\n\u2018And then we had to go down the queue and go it\u2019s 35 quid, and it\u2019s cash.\u2019\n\nThe owners of Ronnie Scott\u2019s, Sally Greene and Michael Watt, always keep space available for celebrity guests \u2013 and with such an exclusive night on the cards, there were plenty of stars wanting to bag their way into the venue.\n\nHowever, getting anyone but the fans waiting outside in was set to be a problem, as Prince\u2019s people initially tried to put a ban on any guestlist spaces being allocated.\n\nNoel Gallagher was among the famous faces bundled up the back stairs (Picture: GC Images)\n\nSimon revealed: \u2018I told Prince\u2019s chief of staff that there will be the owner\u2019s guestlist of people and they said we were not allowed any guests.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he insisted that a guestlist must be allowed, the chief of staff acquiesced that they could have 10 people on their list attend.\n\nSimon continued: \u2018Okay, so we\u2019ve got past the point where we are allowed guests, but it was only 10 and of course Sally who owns this place doesn\u2019t put up with that kind of s**t, she\u2019s got a big guest list, and I\u2019ve got family and they\u2019re coming!\n\n\u2018So we ended up with 73 guests. We snuck them upstairs through the backdoor, instead of through the front door where the Chief of Staff Paisley Park is monitoring the lobby.\n\nStephen Fry had to fight his way through the crowds of Prince fans who had been waiting since 8am in the morning for the show (Picture: GC Images)\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve got the door to the upstairs bar, so we\u2019re filtering them up through the upstairs bar but then also in the office stairs. We ended up with about 73 people up here having a party on this floor and a bit upstairs.\n\n\u2018There was Kate Moss, Stephen Fry, there was Noel Gallagher, Jamie Cullum, all sorts. The most bizarre gathering of people.\n\nCelebs including Rita Ora were filtered down in small groups so Prince\u2019s chief of staff didn\u2019t notice the 73 extra guests (Picture: GC Images)\n\n\u2018They were all up here and we were piling the champagne through the door and then we had to filter them down in bits because I can\u2019t take 73 people down at once or we\u2019re having a problem with the chief of staff!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018So all these really famous people are being snuck down the stairs just so Prince doesn\u2019t throw his toys out of the pram!\u2019\n\nAs well as Kate Moss, Stephen Fry, Noel Gallagher and Jamie Cullum, other attendees on the night included Adele, Rita Ora, Michelle Rodriguez, Nile Rogers and Cara Delevingne.\n\nOh to be a fly on the wall of that office!\n\nRonnie Scott\u2019s celebrates its 60th anniversary on 30 October with a star-studded gala performance from some of the jazz greats who have performed at the venue, taking place at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall.\n\nThe venue\u2019s original location, not far from where the club is located today, was also awarded an English Heritage blue plaque to celebrate the milestone this year.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
