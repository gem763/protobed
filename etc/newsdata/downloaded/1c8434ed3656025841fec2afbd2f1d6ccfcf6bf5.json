Both Democrat and Republican lawmakers asked about quid pro quo, but given that Reeker was in the dark about the push for a statement, he did not know anything about a potential quid pro quo, the source explained.\n\nReeker\u2019s testimony echoed written testimony provided by two other impeachment probe witnesses who said they were not aware of any effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate the former vice president and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nReporters covering the impeachment probe are forced to rely on leaks because the House Democrats have so far conducted the process behind closed doors.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), who witnessed Reeker\u2019s deposition, declared that the top State official\u2019s testimony was a \u201cgood day for the President,\u201d CNN reported.\n\nReeker fueled the GOP argument that Trump \u201cdid not do anything that amounted to an impeachable offense.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there was certainly a number of questions that continue to try and convey \u2018is there an impeachable offense here\u2019 \u2014 was there a quid pro quo? Now you have another State Department official that didn\u2019t provide any support for that allegation,\u201d he reportedly said.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats claimed Reeker\u2019s testimony corroborated claims that Trump did something wrong.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost startling how much in alignment all of the witnesses to date have been in terms of their affirmation of the fact pattern,\u201d Rep. Denny Heck (D-WA) proclaimed, according to CNN.\n\nFormer U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and American Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland told investigators they were not involved in any effort to push for a probe into Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nVolker and Sondland were heavily involved in America\u2019s Ukraine policy.\n\n\u201cAt no time was I aware of or took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden,\u201d Volker said in his opening remarks prepared for his deposition on October 3.\n\nSondland added in his written testimony on October 17:\n\nI recall no discussions with any State Department or White House official about Former Vice President Biden or his son, nor do I recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens. \u2026 Withholding foreign aid in order to pressure a foreign government to take such steps [influence a U.S. election] would be wrong. I did not and would not ever participate in such undertakings.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, however, reported over the weekend that Sondland\u2019s lawyer said the EU ambassador told impeachment committee members during his deposition that Trump\u2019s dealings in Ukraine amounted to a quid pro quo.\n\nTo the dismay of Democrats, Reeker failed to confirm explosive allegations made by Acting Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor during his deposition last week.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Taylor testified that the Trump administration \u201cconditioned\u201d U.S. aid to Ukraine on the Eastern European country publicly announcing an investigation into Biden and his son, suggesting that Trump did make a quid pro quo offer.\n\nRepublican lawmakers said Taylor\u2019s claim is not based on a first-hand account and \u201ccollapsed\u201d when the members of Congress questioned him during his deposition.\n\nHouse Democrats have vowed to make the impeachment probe proceedings public eventually.", "description": "Philip Reeker reportedly told House impeachment investigators he was unaware of the alleged quid pro quo offer at the center of the probe.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Philip-Reeker-Seal-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
