They are the future of our country. How can we let this kind of thing happen?\"\n\nBut with families often betting on their own children, 101 East investigates whether young boxers will continue to pay the ultimate price.\n\nJoin the conversation @AJ101East\n\nSource: Al Jazeera", "description": "101 East travels to Thailand to investigate why children as young as 13 are dying in the brutal sport of Muay Thai.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/3/aed32e0f30e442629ce15c4120e43817_18.jpg"}
