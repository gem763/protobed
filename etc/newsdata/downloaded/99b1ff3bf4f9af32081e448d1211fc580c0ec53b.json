In the first season we get to know morality officer, Mary Shaw, a powerful character filling the first and only position available to women in the 1920s.\n\nWhat is a morality officer?\n\nToronto's Morality Department was established in 1886 to \"root out vice,\" ensure the \"cleanliness of the city,\" and the protection of women and children.\n\n\"Their job was to enforce the morality of women,\" says Rebecca Liddiard, who plays Mary Shaw.\n\n\"They would measure skirts and hems, and hand out tickets to women who were walking unaccompanied at night.\"\n\nIn 1913, the Morality Department added the city's first two female officers. They patrolled parks, theatres, and dance halls \u2013 usually places young, single working-class women frequented.\n\nWomen officers were valued for their \"soft\" approach to information gathering, monitoring the leisure activities of young women, and dealing with children and youth.\n\nBy the late 1920s, the branch maintained a total of five female officers, while there were 1,000 male officers in the Toronto police force. In comparison, Vancouver Police's Morality Squad, formed in 1916, employed mostly women.\n\nYou might hear from a morality officer if you're...\n\nDancing with a man who paid for your drink\n\nA woman could be suspected of \"assisted prostitution\" by simply being out alone at night. If she danced with a man who paid for her drink, she would get a fine and a ticket.\n\nFlirting with the same sex\n\nYou could be charged with \"gross indecency\" or \"buggery\" for any acts that fall under a broad spectrum of male homosexual behaviour. This offence was repealed in 1988 and no longer exists today.\n\n\"Every male person is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to five years' imprisonment and to be whipped who, in public or private, commits, or is a party to the commission of, or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of, any acts of gross indecency with another male person.\" - The Constable's Manual, 1916\n\nWorking or participating in entertainment, commerce on a Sunday\n\nIn 1926 alone, almost 1,000 people were arrested in Toronto for violating these laws, according to the Toronto Public Library archives. In 1912, tobogganing in High Park on Sundays was prohibited and even streetcars were not allowed to run.\n\nGiving an immoral theatrical performance\n\nThis would see you charged with one year in prison, or a fine of $500, or both. Any literary, visual, or theatrical artist could be in trouble due to the vague definition of \"obscenity\" in the Canadian Criminal Code at the time.\n\nOther 1920s illegal acts\n\nDrinking or being drunk in public\n\nBeing in an interracial relationship\n\nBetting on table games: In 1922, it was made illegal to bet on shell games, punch cards, coin tables, and wheels of fortune.\n\nResources:", "description": "-", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5261178.1566917354!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/frankie-drake-morality-officer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
