REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces two Brexit votes on Tuesday: one on a Withdrawal Agreement Bill and one on the government\u2019s proposed timetable for approving the legislation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too close to call whether there will be a majority,\u201d said DZ Bank rates strategist Daniel Lenz. \u201cThis may be also very much reflected by market developments, [in] that you don\u2019t see major movement to one or the other side.\u201d\n\nJohnson told parliament that if it delayed his Brexit legislation he would abandon his attempt to ratify the deal to exit the EU and push for an election instead.\n\nTen-year government bond yields across the euro zone were down around 3 basis points on the day DE10YT=RR NL10YT=RR FR10YT=RR. Germany\u2019s 10-year yield was at -0.378%.\n\nAnalysts say much of the optimism around Brexit is already priced in and expect subdued reactions. The German 10-year bond yield has risen 17 bps since Oct. 10.\n\n\u201cThe market is pricing a lot of optimism, a) on the no-deal Brexit being taken off the table tonight, b) on the deal being approved tonight. Therefore, there\u2019s not much room for rates to move higher,\u201d said ING senior rates strategist Antoine Bouvet.\n\nSeparately, source told Reuters on Tuesday that Germany is set to pick university professor Isabel Schnabel to join the European Central Bank\u2019s executive board.\n\n\u201cHer reputation suggests she is fairly continuous with mainstream policy thinking in Germany and German institutional views on monetary policy. We\u2019d expect that to continue,\u201d said Sunil Krishnan, head of multi-asset funds at Aviva Investors.\n\nThe ECB meets on Thursday for Mario Draghi\u2019s final policy meeting as the central bank\u2019s president.\n\nGraphic: Euro zone periphery govt bond yields \u2014 tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr\n\nITALY OUTPERFORMS\n\nItalian government bonds outperformed, the 10-year yield falling 7 basis points to 1.02% IT10YT=RR and putting it on course for its best day in October.\n\n\u201cThink of BTPs at the moment as being bunds with greater volatility. So when the bund market sells off, BTPs tend to sell off more,\u201d ING\u2019s Bouvet said.\n\nThe European Commission has sent a letter to Italian authorities, asking for clarification over their 2020 draft budgets. Rome will reply by Wednesday.\n\nA major conflict is not expected, unlike last year when the Commission sent back Italy\u2019s draft budget and asked for a new one, sparking a surge in Italian yields.\n\nItaly\u2019s draft 2020 budget assumes a rise in its structural deficit of 0.1% of GDP. Under EU rules, it should fall to 0.6% of GDP.\n\nItaly\u2019s debt rose to 138.0% of gross domestic product in the second quarter of the year, up from 136.6% in the previous three months, in further violation of EU requirements.\n\nAnalysts said a successful sale of BTP Italia inflation-linked bonds to retail investors supported Italian bonds.", "description": "Euro zone government bonds yields fell on Tuesday, before a vote in the British parliament that may determine whether the UK can leave the European Union in an orderly way at the end of the month.", "authors": ["Yoruk", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443698970&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0WD", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
