Roskomnadzor is the Russian federal body most known for its responsibility for censorship in the media. It also acts to oversee the confidential handling of personal data in Russia and the organisation of the radio-frequency service. It has in the past notable blocked websites including Wikipedia, Pornhub and parts of Amazon.\n\nAccording to D-Russia, the tests of the network isolation will begin after November 1, 2019 and will be repeatedly at least annually.\n\n\n\n'On Monday, the government approved the provision on conducting exercises to ensure the stable, safe and holistic functioning of the Internet and public communications networks in the Russian Federation,' D-Russia reported.\n\n'The exercises are [to be] held at the federal and regional levels.'\n\nThe Russian Government is believed to consider its present reliance on Western IT as a strategic vulnerability that could be exploited by other nations.\n\n'The larger context is Russia\u2019s dependence as a nation on imported/foreign hi-tech and the perceived vulnerabilities that Russia sees in such technology use,' Russian expert at the American Foreign Policy Council Samuel Bendett told Defense One.\n\n'With so many government, public, and private-sector nodes using such foreign tech, the Russian government is seeking to impose a measure of control over how Internet communication over this technology is conducted.'\n\n'In the event of what the government sees as outside influence affecting RuNet, the state can act \u2014 hence the annual exercise.'\n\nHowever, critics have claimed that the tests are part of a wider attempt to isolate its citizens from the surrounding world and its influences.
