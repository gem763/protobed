I know Afghans will protect democracy,\u201d Ghani said at an election rally, adding the hardline Islamist group was unable to defeat the Afghan people\u2019s inherent spirit of freedom and desire for progress.\n\nOn Friday, with hours to go until voting begins, there was a relative lull in reported attacks on civilians. The Taliban had threatened violence to sow discord during the elections.\n\n\u201cStay away from polling stations on election day,\u201d the Taliban warned in their latest statement.\n\nA Taliban spokesman said the militants had on Friday blocked roads in central Parwan province and attacked security forces transporting election material, as well as taking the Qaramqul district of northern Faryab province after a battle with government troops.\n\nIn the run-up to the election before Friday, more than 170 civilians have been killed and more than 300 wounded in attacks involving the Taliban.\n\nDespite decades of war, 9.67 million Afghans were registered to vote in 2019 out of a population estimated at 34 million.\n\nTo fight the militants, the country will deploy more than 100,000 members of the security forces, according to two senior security officials in Kabul.\n\nThe Afghan government allocated $90 million and international donors have given $59 million to conduct elections across 34 provinces, but hundreds of polling stations in schools and mosques are likely to remain closed following Taliban threats.\n\nGhani\u2019s rival, Abdullah, has accused the president of abuse of power and using government resources in his election campaign.\n\nAbdullah said he feared the outcome could be skewed by voter fraud and that would threaten the country\u2019s unstable democracy.\n\n\u201cHe (Ghani) has been a hurdle, an obstacle towards peace. This person is not suitable for the job,\u201d he told Reuters on Thursday.\n\nIf there are \u201cmassively fraudulent elections, and somebody is announced as a winner, this will not be accepted,\u201d he added.\n\nWestern and Asian diplomats in Kabul said the fear of Taliban violence has sapped enthusiasm for the vote, with some expecting a record low turnout.\n\nOther fears include the disenfranchisement of women.
