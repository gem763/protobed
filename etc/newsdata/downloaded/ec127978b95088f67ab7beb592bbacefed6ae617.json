Silverstone says she brought an eco-friendly reusable coffee mug to reduce waste, but was disappointed to see employees \u2014 and many of her fellow customers \u2014 still using disposable cups for their beverages.\n\nAlicia Silverstone is taking Starbucks to task. (Photo: REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni) More\n\nThe former teen star added that Starbucks\u2019s policy of charging for non-dairy milk, such as soy or almond, \u201cpenalized\u201d customers for \u201cmaking the eco choice.\u201d She also requested that they start offering unsweetened oat milk, a popular non-dairy milk alternative for vegans.\n\nDepressing! Just brought my reusable mug to @Starbucks &saw staff use a disposable cup, pour it into my mug, then toss the disposable cup. Totally defeats the purpose of trying 2 reduce waste. Then I looked around to see so many people sitting @ the cafe all w disposables! Ugh. \u2014 Alicia Silverstone (@AliciaSilv) September 10, 2019\n\nStarbucks has responded to her concerns by acknowledging its efforts to \u201cbe mindful of waste\u201d and encourage baristas to avoid using disposable cups when a customer brings in a reusable alternative. The company insisted that adding \u201calternative milks\u201d to certain drinks is free, unless it\u2019s a custom order that varies from the original recipe, in which case a \u201csmall surcharge\u201d must be paid.\n\nAlso!I'm always frustrated by extra charges for non-dairy milk. Y should we be penalized 4 making the eco-choice? It would be amazing for @Starbucks to lead the way &consider enviro externalities associated w the dairy industry by having dairy cost + or at least = plantmilk fees. \u2014 Alicia Silverstone (@AliciaSilv) September 10, 2019\n\n\u201cStarbucks baristas are encouraged to craft beverages directly in customers\u2019 reusable cups whenever possible,\u201d a statement reads. \u201cBuilding on our long-standing commitment to sustainability and an elevated customer experience, we will take this opportunity to review guidance to our partners about personal cup use as we continue to be mindful of waste.\n\n. @starbucks one more thing - can you please get unsweetened oat milk at all your locations? \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f \u2014 Alicia Silverstone (@AliciaSilv) September 10, 2019\n\n\u201cRegarding alternative milks, adding a splash of any alternative milk to brewed or iced coffee, cold brew or an Americano is always offered free of charge. The price of our beverages is based on a standard recipe, so any customizations that are not part of the standard recipe, which could include added flavors, alternative milk or an additional shot of espresso, will incur a small surcharge.\u201d\n\nSilverstone\u2019s rant received plenty of support from like-minded fans, who called for the chain to be less \u201ccareless\u201d about the environment. But some scolded the star for not going the extra eco-friendly mile by skipping Starbucks entirely in favor of a homemade brew or by supporting a local, indie coffee shop.\n\nThis is all good and eco-friendly stuff you\u2019re requesting, but the most eco-friendly thing is always going to be to make your coffee at home! Convenience is the cause of so much waste in the world\u2014the whole \u201cI need it right now\u201d thing. \u2014 Marge Tenenbaum (@margetenenbaum) September 12, 2019\n\nWhy not make your own coffee with reusable filters at home? #Clueless \u2014 Cams Chorizo (@camschorizo) September 12, 2019\n\nStarbucks sucks!
