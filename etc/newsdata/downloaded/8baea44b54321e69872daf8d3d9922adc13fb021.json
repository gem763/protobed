Now add in the fact that their opponent was Northwest Missouri State \u2014 a Division-II school \u2014 and you'll begin to understand why Duke fans across the country feel panicked about a game that doesn't even count towards the team's record on the season.\n\nDuke sophomore point guard Tre Jones drives into the lane during Saturday's contest.

That's good. If they were laughing and joking and giving high-fives, then they would be acceptant of the fact that they didn't play as well.\"\n\n\"Our guys need to get older and tougher,\" he added.\n\nContext doesn't paint a very pretty picture for this year's Blue Devils. Superstar Zion Williamson and Duke's two additional top-10 2019 NBA Draft picks won their exhibition games by a whopping 63 points on average last season. The year before, the Blue Devils averaged 48 points more than their early-season foes. And prior to the 2017-18 season, that number was 42.\n\nIn fact, in the 15 years since the Blue Devils started playing exhibition games to open the year, Duke has never failed to win by double digits. That is, until now.\n\nKrzyzewski \u2014 better known to most as Coach K \u2014 described Saturday night's showing as \"really a good game for us\" despite his team's obvious issues on the offensive side of the court. The Blue Devils shot 42.2% from the floor and 12.5% from beyond the arc on the night. No player who attempted more than three shots averaged more than 50% shooting, and only two of Duke's players racked up more than 10 points in the unflattering affair.\n\n\"Offensively, we are not a good shooting team,\" Krzyzewski said after the game. \"Around the basket, we left a lot of points on the court. We should've scored a lot more points.\"\n\nDuke redshirt senior Justin Robinson defends the basket against the Bearcats.

Three of their players registered double-digit scoring, including a 27-point performance from sophomore Trevor Hudgins.\n\nKrzyzewski didn't seem particularly surprised by the fact that head coach Ben McCollum's squad stuck around with his Blue Devils. Last season, Northwest Missouri State went a perfect 38-0 en route to its second NCAA Division II national championship in three years. And with a much more experienced roster than Coach K's band of 18-year-olds, the Bearcats managed to keep their composure in one of the most hostile environments in all of college basketball.\n\n\"We knew coming in how good they have been and are,\" Krzyzewski said. \"You don't win 100 out of the last 105 games ... without having great kids, really good talent, and outstanding coaching... We beat an outstanding team tonight.\"\n\nDuke will host Fort Valley State for its second and final exhibition game of the season Wednesday before the Blue Devils begin their arduous regular-season schedule. They'll travel to New York City to take on the third-ranked Kansas Jayhawks in the 2019 Champions Classic November 5 and, less than a month later, will face off against Tom Izzo's top-ranked Michigan State Spartans on the road.\n\nThe early season will certainly be a trial by fire for Duke, and if Saturday's lackluster performance was any indication, it may result in burnout for the Blue Devils.", "description": "\"I would say [they were] disappointed, and they should be,\" legendary Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski said of his players after their 69-63 win.", "authors": ["Meredith Cash"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db51195dee01933a8025463?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
