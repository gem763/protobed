Bush in 2003 in which he announce an end to major combat in Iraq.\n\nRice said, \u201cObviously it\u2019s a major milestone and it\u2019s one we all should be welcoming quite plainly, but it doesn\u2019t mean that the fight against ISIS is over. And it doesn\u2019t mean that we can declare mission accomplished and just walk away.
