Coaches can\u2019t appeal suspensions, so he\u2019ll serve it tonight.\n\nAs I was literally in a cabin in the woods on Saturday when the game happened I did not see what Loretta did, but given how the weekend went for the Cubs, I imagine that overall crankiness had a lot to do with it. Probably some colorful language and/or gestures as well.\n\nIn other news, reports are swirling that Loretta is a top choice to replace Joe Maddon in the extraordinarily likely chance of Maddon being let go as Cubs\u2019 manager once they are eliminated and his contract expires at season\u2019s end.", "description": "Mark Loretta also happens to be rumored to be Joe Maddon's successor for the Cubs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5E1ZIjDE6n.pZP39ooabkQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MzI-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/b2LKxeNFIS8fswXb4FIijA--~B/aD04NDg7dz0xMzA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/d30754deff995637362d1ac764b59cf6", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
