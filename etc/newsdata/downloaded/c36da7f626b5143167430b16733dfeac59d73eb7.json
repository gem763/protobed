The reasonable move, for young progressive leaders planning for the future, might be to throw in with Warren.\n\nBut not everyone is feeling like it\u2019s Warren\u2019s turn. Some pretty big names, it turns out, are feeling\u2026 something different.\n\nAt a park in Queens, New York, today, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is to announce that in 2020, she is once again feeling the Bern. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement of Sanders sent shock waves through progressive circles, and raised a host of questions. It also showed the enormous star power of Ocasio-Cortez, who has spent just a year in the House but has already become one of the most influential figures in Democratic politics.\n\nHer move could shake up the race.\n\nWould Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 joined in the endorsement by Representative Ilhan Omar, one of the first Muslim women to serve in the US Congress \u2013 give the Sanders campaign new snap? Would Warren have to run harder left to compete? And could the endorsements represent a liability in the general election, when it comes time to lure voters who might formerly have backed Donald Trump?\n\n\u201cI think the jury\u2019s still out on how many votes endorsements move,\u201d said Karthik Ganapathy, a progressive political strategist with mvmt communications. \u201cThat said, if any one endorsement in the country has the potential to reshape the race, this is the one.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsement is a coup for any candidate who received it,\u201d agreed Neil Sroka, communications director of the progressive group Democracy for America. \u201cIt\u2019s designed to be a show of strength for Senator Sanders in a moment when many in the national media thought he might have been weakened by the news surrounding his heart incident.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Capitol Hill in Washington Thursday. Photograph: Susan Walsh/AP\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s starpower on the left is immense. \u201cThe extraordinary thing about people who follow her is that a lot of them are young people who aren\u2019t tracking politics very closely,\u201d said Ganapathy. \u201cShe\u2019s activated a lot of people.\u201d\n\nFor Sanders, the timing seems just right. With only four months to go before voting begins, he sits in third place in most polling of the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, where a victory in 2016 supercharged his campaign. Whatever happens in the early states, Sanders led the pack in third-quarter fundraising and is likely to have the money to run as long as he likes.\n\nBut her endorsement strategy is not without risks.\n\nWizened political observers have questioned whether the timing was right for Ocasio-Cortez, given that her early endorsement could set her up to be a late adopter, if Sanders does not win the nomination, and could detract from the power of her ultimate endorsement, if it came to that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that she chose now to blow her political capital,\u201d said Rick Wilson, a Republican strategist. \u201cIt goes to show you that just star power alone doesn\u2019t equal good political judgment.\u201d\n\nThe early endorsement showed that Ocasio-Cortez was \u201cleading with her values,\u201d Srota countered.\n\n\u201cThis is an example, I think, of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez being true to herself and true to her vision for the future of the country, and to the issues that have guided her from the very beginning of her race for congress back in 2017,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bernie Sanders speaks during a recent rally in Denver.

In an analysis of whether the endorsement would move the Democratic primary race, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Nate Silver pointed out that historically, endorsements have mattered \u2013 with the gigantic asterisk of Trump, whom the Republican party at first resisted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good news for [Sanders],\u201d Silver wrote, \u201cbut it will be better news for him to the extent it presages a more coalition-oriented approach to running a campaign, which includes building alliances with diverse groups of voters and winning endorsements in an effort to expand his coalition.\u201d\n\nLurking in the background is the question of how Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s support could affect the Democratic nominee\u2019s prospects in the general election. A relatively small pool of polls has indicated that Ocasio-Cortez has a negative favorability rating nationally.\n\nMichael McAdams, national press secretary at National Republican Congressional Committee, said in a direct message that the country is not aligned with Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders.\n\n\u201cAOC\u2019s endorsement of Bernie Sanders confirms the Democratic party stands for a radical socialist agenda including government-run health care, open borders and the redistribution of wealth,\u201d he said.\n\nThe statement echoed toxic attacks on Ocasio-Cortez and her colleagues by Trump, attacks the president seems likely to resurface whoever his 2020 election opponent is.\n\nPolitical strategists on the left said it would be a mistake to craft an agenda around anticipated political attacks, however, as opposed to longstanding policy priorities.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a risk for the Democrats of moving too far left,\u201d said Ganapathy. \u201cOcasio-Cortez in particular has shown her contempt for a willingness to triangulate.\n\n\u201cIt makes perfect sense to me that she would go with Bernie.\u201d", "description": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will announce today she\u2019s backing Bernie Sanders, raising a host of questions for progressives \u2013 and Trump supporters", "authors": ["Tom Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/306fa976991bebc34dba18d4ac28d065d11b391a/310_575_4628_2777/master/4628.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=31e52ccc09e913873b101d1899e68e67", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
