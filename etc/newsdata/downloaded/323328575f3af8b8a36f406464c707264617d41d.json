Most visitors to the conservative kingdom have been for the holy pilgrimage but Saudi Arabia is now open to tourists from 49 countries though Mecca is still off limits for non-Muslims. The country's tourism board has confirmed that foreign couples will now be able to stay together in the same room\n\nVisitors can be seen photographing the new slogan for Saudi tourism outside a gala evening hosted by the Saudi Commission for Tourism and Heritage at Al Diriyah in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The conservative kingdom forbids sex outside of marriage so, until now, individuals had to prove they were related in order to share a room together\n\nThe moves appear to pave the way for unaccompanied women to travel more easily and for unmarried foreign visitors to stay together in the Gulf state, where sex outside of marriage is banned.\n\nThe Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage confirmed a report on Friday by Arabic-language newspaper Okaz, adding:\n\n'All Saudi nationals are asked to show family ID or proof of relationship on checking into hotels. This is not required of foreign tourists. All women, including Saudis, can book and stay in hotels alone, providing ID on check-in.'\n\nSaudi Arabia threw open its doors last week to foreign tourists from 49 countries as it tries to grow that sector and diversify its economy away from oil exports.\n\nAs part of the move, it decreed that visitors need not wear all-covering black robes but should dress modestly. Alcohol remains banned.\n\nSaudi Arabia has been relatively closed off for decades and until recently unrelated men and women, including foreigners, could be severely punished for mixing in public.\n\nThe introduction of the Saudi E-Visa for 49 countries is an attempt to diversify the country's economy and to prepare it for a post-oil future. Up until recently, men and women caught mingling in public, even foreigners, faced severe punishments\n\nStrict social codes have been relaxed in recent years and previously banned entertainment has flourished.\n\nBut an influx of tourists - the authorities are aiming for 100 million annual visits by 2030 - could push boundaries further and risks conservative backlash.\n\nThe kingdom ended a heavily criticised ban on women driving last year and in August granted women new rights to travel abroad, chipping away at a guardianship system that assigns each woman a male relative to approve important decisions throughout their lives.\n\nThe CIA consider the chances that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (pictured left) ordered the extrajudicial killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi (pictured right)as medium to high. MBS, and the country's, reputation was stained by the savage butchering of a dissenting journalist , something that the crown prince said should not have happened . The opening of the country to tourism was around a week before the first anniversary of the journalist's death\n\nThe changes are part of de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's ambitious economic and social reform agenda.\n\nHis plans have received international praise, but his image has been tarnished by the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a crackdown on dissent, and a devastating war in Yemen.\n\nUntil now, foreigners travelling to Saudi Arabia have been largely restricted to resident workers and their dependents, business travellers, and Muslim pilgrims who are given special visas to visit the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.", "description": "Saudi Arabia has announced that foreign couples will be allowed to share hotel rooms when visiting the kingdom in a break from decades of rigid cultural conservativism.", "authors": ["Ryan Fahey For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/11/19329772-0-image-a-51_1570270479078.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
