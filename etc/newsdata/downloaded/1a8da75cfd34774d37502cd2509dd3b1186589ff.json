Here is just one, from Indiana: The factory town of Muncie is famed as the site of the Middletown sociology studies a century ago. It was the longtime home of the Ball Brothers glass-jar company, since departed. It is still the home of Ball State University, steadily growing. Like other manufacturing cities in the Midwest, Muncie has battled the effects of industrial decline. Among the consequences was a funding crisis for the Muncie Community Schools, which became so severe that two years ago the state took the system into receivership.\n\nLast year, Ball State University became the first-ever public university in the country to assume direct operational responsibility for an entire K\u201312 public-school system. The experiment has just begun, and its success can\u2019t be assured. But getting this far involved innovation and creativity in the political, civic, financial, and educational realms to win support in a diverse community. \u201cI was talking with a state senator about the plan,\u201d Geoffrey S. Mearns, who has been president of Ball State since 2017 and is a guiding force behind the plan, told me this year in Muncie. \u201cAfter listening for 15 minutes, he said, \u2018You\u2019re crazy. Don\u2019t do this. Run away.\u2019 After another 15 minutes, he said, \u2018You\u2019re still crazy. But you have to do it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThis craziness and commitment keeps a culture alive. A new world is emerging, largely beyond our notice.\n\nOur Towns: James Fallows on how a local newspaper survives\n\nEven when the formal ties of the Roman empire had broken, informal links connected its various parts. In the absence of the Roman state, there was still the Latin language as the original lingua franca; there was still a network of roads. Christianity in some form was a shared religion. Today the links include trade, travel, family lineage, and collaborative research\u2014links that, like the internet, were forged in an era of functioning national and global institutions but with a better chance to endure. \u201cWith the waning of federal government, you\u2019d see some states really big enough to act as countries, starting of course with California,\u201d Anne-Marie Slaughter, the CEO of the think tank New America, told me. \u201cYou could imagine Texas working with Mexico, and New England with Canada\u2014and the upper-Midwest states as a bloc, and the Pacific Northwest.\u201d She pointed out that states can\u2019t sign formal treaties\u2014but then again, the U.S. Senate has not approved a major treaty in years.\n\nMorley Winograd, a former adviser to Al Gore and a co-author of the new book Healing American Democracy: Going Local, argues that networked localities have already taken effective control of crucial policy areas. \u201cIf recent trends continue,\u201d he told me, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason why community colleges won\u2019t be tuition-free across the country, without any federal role. It\u2019s happened in 13 states, and we\u2019re near a tipping point.\u201d After Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord, more than 400 U.S. mayors, representing most of the U.S. economy, said their communities would still adhere to it. \u201cThat is where most of the leverage lies on sustainability\u2014with mayors and governors,\u201d Winograd told me. He gave the example of planting trees, which might sound insignificant but, according to a new study by researchers in Switzerland, could be a crucial step toward removing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. \u201cThis could spread city by city, state by state, with no federal involvement or limitation,\u201d he said. Last year, the Trump administration said it would abandon the targets for cutting automobile emissions and improving fuel efficiency that the Obama administration had said automakers must reach. This year, Ford, BMW, Volkswagen, and Honda announced that they would ignore the shift in federal policy. Instead, they would \u201crecognize California\u2019s authority\u201d to set strict emissions and efficiency standards, and would sell cars meeting those standards in all 50 states.", "description": "The decline of the federal government might not be such a bad thing.", "authors": ["James Fallows", "National Correspondent At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2019/08/DIS_Fallows_Rome/facebook.jpg?1566928235", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
