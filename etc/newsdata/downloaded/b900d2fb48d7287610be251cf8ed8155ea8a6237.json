The third umpire, whom Rapoport labeled the wisest, said \u201cSome is strikes and some is balls, but they ain\u2019t nothing till I calls them.\u201d\n\nThe latter ump is hilarious and I\u2019d love to hear his stand-up routine. Technically, he\u2019s absolutely correct: Pitches are nothing until he says so.\n\nBut folks make their own ruling before the ump opens his mouth. And his pronouncement never changes opposing points of view, especially when replays confirm his erroneous verdicts.\n\nPresented with pitch graphs from Game 5 of the World Series, I\u2019m sure home plate umpire Lance Barksdale would admit what millions of us already know -\u2014 he blew several ball-strike calls that played a role in Houston\u2019s 7-1 victory against Washington. While no performance behind the plate is likely to top Eric Gregg\u2019s legendary malpractice in Game 5 of the 1997 National League Championship Series, Barksdale merits Dishonorable Mention based on the severity and the stakes.\n\nUnlike Gregg \u2014 whose Dade County-sized zone seemed to favor Florida\u2019s Livan Hernandez (15 strikeouts) compared to Atlanta\u2019s Greg Maddux (nine) \u2014 Barksdale was an equal-opportunity offender Sunday.\n\nHouston shortstop Carlos Correa homered in the top of the fourth inning, one pitch after taking what appeared to be strike three from Joe Ross. There were multiple baffling calls against both teams in the sixth inning. The Astros were furious in the top of the seventh, and the Nationals were livid in the bottom, when Victor Robles was called out on ball four.\n\n\u201cI will never sit here and criticize an umpire,\u201d Washington manager Dave Martinez said afterward.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much emotion that goes on in these plays,\u201d Houston manager A.J. Hinch said of both dugouts erupting over seventh-inning calls. \u201cDepending on which side you are on, you\u2019re going to have that reaction.\u201d\n\nUnless you\u2019re simply on the \u201cget-it-right\u201d side.\n\nConsistency is all anyone can ask for. Regardless of the pitcher\u2019s resume or the batter\u2019s prowess, and irrespective of the umpire\u2019s previous call or his activities the night before, a steady strike zone is as good as it gets. As long as the same pitches are balls/strikes for both teams, there\u2019s no argument.\n\nBut humans \u2014 including umpires \u2014 are too fallible and too imperfect to deliver accurate calls 100% of the time.\n\nUmpires don\u2019t receive an \u201cE\u201d for their errors like players do, but mistakes happen all over the field \u2014 committed by arbiters behind the plate, at each base, and (in the postseason) down the foul lines. There\u2019s no getting around the human element of any participant.\n\nThat being said, we can eliminate (or greatly reduce) blunders made by officials. We can leave outcomes to be decided (almost) solely by the success and failure of players and managers.\n\nI\u2019m not calling for robot umpires.\n\nI\u2019m calling for digitized strike zones, official utilization of something akin to the pitch graphs that MLB provides for every at-bat.\n\nThey were all over social media Sunday, illustrating the absurdity of some of Barksdale\u2019s calls.\n\nLet umps stay behind the plate. Let them announce balls and strikes in their own inimitable fashion. Let them incorporate the dramatic flair of Leslie Nielsen\u2019s moonwalking, gyrating, break-dancing umpire in \u201cThe Naked Gun.\u201d\n\nBut for goodness sake, don\u2019t let them continue to decide balls and strikes. Technology should do that.\n\nJust relay the split-second call to umpires, via earpiece, and let them relay it to everyone else.\n\nTechnology doesn\u2019t offer makeup calls, subconsciously or otherwise. Technology isn\u2019t offended when players make presumptions and wrongly head toward first base or the dugout. Technology isn\u2019t influenced or intimidated, or subject to choke under pressure on the biggest stage.\n\nIs it perfect? No. Testing in the Arizona Fall League proves that a prospective system has a long way to go. But that\u2019s the direction baseball should take, full speed ahead.\n\nAt least pitch graphs provide a consistent, objective standard, opposed to whatever we get from various umpires on given nights throughout the course of a game.\n\n\u201cLance did not lose us the game tonight,\u201d Washington first baseman Ryan Zimmerman said.\n\nTrue.\n\nBut Barksdale\u2019s arbitrary calls definitely played a role and became a major talking point in Game 5\u2019s aftermath. A digitized system would eliminate most of the controversy and much of the chatter while increasing accuracy and fairness.\n\nUntil then, Barksdale and MLB plate umpires everywhere represent a human element that\u2019s unnecessary, unbecoming and unwelcome.\n\nEven non-scholars can make that call.\n\n\u2981 Deron Snyder writes his award-winning column for The Washington Times on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
