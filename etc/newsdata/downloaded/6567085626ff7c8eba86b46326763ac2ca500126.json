The station has been used as a filming location for The ABC Murders (2018), Darkest Hour (2017), Sherlock (2014), and Atonement (2007)\n\nThe booking office at Aldwych.

Although just below the ground, the shelter survived a Blitz attack that destroyed the station\u2019s surface-level building. This station was opened in 1884 and closed in 1938\n\nAn escalator shaft and works access tunnel under construction at Bank in 2018, with modern construction techniques used on an epic scale to upgrade capacity and interchange behind the scenes\n\nOne of the bricked-up station tunnels at Highgate station, now a protected bat sanctuary\n\nOne of the original, subterranean passenger walkways at North End, built in the 1900s on the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway, but never used. It's seen here with later flood defence modifications, including a reinforced steel door\n\nA large, redundant fan impeller in a dark corner of disused York Road station.

Here, at Bank, it seems that the construction workers have asked the saint to consider an additional request\n\nOne of the tunnels under the Thames.
