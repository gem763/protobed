When we get this kind of clean sleep, we wake up feeling refreshed, invigorated and looking forward to the day ahead.\u2019\n\nAccording to Dr Nerina, clean sleeping each night for between seven and 10 days will give you a more energised outlook upon waking, so sticking to these routines is key.\n\nHere\u2019s what to do if you\u2019re struggling to get up now that it\u2019s dark outside.\n\nFinding yourself tired all through winter? (Picture: Ella Byworth)\n\nEat breakfast\n\nThere are many great reasons to eat breakfast (including because hash browns exist), and one of them is that it helps you sleep in the evening.\n\n\u2018People who eat breakfast have less difficulty falling asleep, wake up with more energy and are less inclined to hit the snooze button,\u2019 says Dr Nerine.\n\n\u2018Eating breakfast within 30-45 minutes of waking up stabilizes your blood sugar levels and speeds up your metabolism. If you can, try to include some protein and vary your breakfasts to keep you motivated.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat a great excuse for all the avocado toast haters out there.\n\nHave some early morning \u2018you time\u2019\n\nIt may seem counter-productive, but getting up a little bit earlier than normal can actually be beneficial.\n\nRather than waking up and running off to work, allow yourself that extra time to warm up for the day ahead.\n\nDr Nerina advises: \u2018Use this time to think about what you have to look forward to that day. Smile and count your blessings. You\u2019ll soon realise how valuable this early morning you time is. You might even start to look forward to it.\u2019\n\nAvoid checking your phone first thing\n\nWe\u2019ve chatted before about how blue lights from phones and other devices can disrupt your plans to get to sleep at night.\n\nBut did you know they can also screw up how you wake up, causing stress to your brain and stopping the gradual awakening process?\n\nNot only this, says Dr Nerina, but \u2018if you go to bed knowing you\u2019re going to be straight up and into work mode you\u2019ll be far more inclined to roll over when the alarm goes off\u2019.\n\nAutumn cosiness isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be when the alarm goes off (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nDon\u2019t rely on caffeine\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t talk to me before I\u2019ve had my coffee\u2019 \u2013 recognise that phrase?\n\nAs catchy as this might be, it\u2019s a vicious cycle of wakefulness and tiredness that can stop you getting clean sleep you need.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Caffeine blocks the action of melatonin which helps us sleep and increases the number of times you wake up during the night,\u2019 says Dr Nerina\n\n\u2018Try to avoid any caffeine after 3pm, never have caffeine before your breakfast and if you\u2019re really serious about becoming a bright-eyed morning person, cut it out completely.\u2019\n\nWind down in the evening\n\nFailure to prepare is preparing to fail, and this is particularly pertinent when it comes to sleep.\n\nDr Nerina recommends having a solid sleep routine, but says \u2018this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean going to sleep earlier, but it does mean starting to wind down earlier in the evening.\n\n\u2018A perfect way to do this is with a hot bicarbonate of soda bath 60 to 90 minutes before bed. Add two big mugs of bicarbonate of soda to comfortably hot water. Immerse yourself completely for 20 minutes.\n\n\u2018The bicarbonate neutralises the skin\u2019s acidity, softens dry skin and is a good aid in detoxification. Don\u2019t use soap or shampoo as the chemicals will reduce the effect. Rinse off and go to bed soon afterwards. You will feel very tired, sleep well and find it much easier to get up in the morning.\u2019\n\nExercise\n\nAlthough cold and damp weather can make you want to curl up under your duvet rather than do bicep curls, research suggests that exercise is exactly what you need to sleep longer and better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the reasoning behind this is isn\u2019t completely clear, it\u2019s thought that it may have something to do with body temperature and endorphins released during exercise.\n\nSo, around 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day has way more benefits that just being able to get up stairs without being out of breath.\n\nMORE: How to avoid getting jealous when your friends hang out without you\n\nMORE: Mum creates Harry Potter themed bedroom for her son for \u00a3150\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "As the nights draw in and the mornings become darker, you may be wondering how best to get up in the mornings.
