Trump abruptly ended talks earlier this month, revealing on Twitter that he had invited Taliban leaders to the United States but canceled their visit after a bombing in Kabul killed a US soldier.\n\nKhan said just before meeting Trump that he would be underlining that \"there's not going to be a military solution\" in Afghanistan, which also neighbors Pakistan.\n\n\"For 19 years if you have not been able to succeed, you're not going to be able to succeed in another 19 years,\" Khan said in an address to the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nKhan -- whose government has sought to use its influence with the Taliban -- admitted that Trump's snapping off diplomacy caught him off-guard.\n\n\"We read it in the paper. It should have been at least been discussed with us,\" he said.\n\nKhan, a former cricket star who has long criticized military operations against extremists, discounted the possibility that the internationally recognized government would be toppled by the Taliban if US troops pulled out.\n\n\"I don't think the Taliban will be able to control the whole country. I think there will be a settlement,\" he said.\n\n\"I honestly believe that this is not the Taliban of 2001. There are lot of things that happened and I believe they will be more accommodating,\" he said.\n\nThe Taliban imposed an austere version of Islam on most of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, banning music and girls' education and giving refuge to Al-Qaeda.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump held an unusual joint rally in Texas with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a Hindu nationalist.", "description": "United Nations (United States) (AFP) - Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday pressed US President Donald Trump to restart talks with Afghanistan's Taliban and said Washington has a \"duty\" to calm the Kashmir standoff with India.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6J1e56pfuIQRxA1zxO5hQQ--~B/aD01MDA7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/3d187bfb0212615e92d63c36ebe6850027ea48f4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
