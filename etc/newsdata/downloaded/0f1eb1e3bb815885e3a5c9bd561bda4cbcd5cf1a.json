A ghost, a UFO...\u201d a retired general said.\n\nSaid Bouteflika had become Algeria\u2019s de facto ruler during the past five years after his brother suffered a stroke in 2013, a period that coincided with the intelligence service losing some of its influence. He had tried to seek a fifth presidential term for his older brother.\n\nArmy chief Lieutenant General Ahmed Gaed Salah has since emerged as the key figure in the deadlock between the authorities and protesters, pushing for the election that has been declared for this year.", "description": "Algeria's one-time kingmaker and intelligence chief went on trial on Monday along with his successor and a brother of the ousted president for \"conspiring against the army\", state radio reported.", "authors": ["Lamine Chikhi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
