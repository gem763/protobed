Kelly Track", "language": "en", "text": "Laga Gaga is re-releasing both CD and vinyl versions of Artpop without her controversial track with R. Kelly, who\u2019s currently in jail awaiting trial for 13 sex trafficking charges.\n\nNew CD and vinyl versions of Gaga\u2019s third studio album \u2013 without \u201cDo What U Want\u201d \u2013 are both available for pre-order over in the UK, The Independent reports. The album track list on Gaga\u2019s site still includes \u201cDo What U Want\u201d, but this version is listed as \u2018sold out\u2019.\n\nThe removal of the controversial track follows Gaga\u2019s vow earlier in the year to remove the track from all streaming platforms.\n\n\u201cAs a victim of sexual assault myself, I made both the song and video at a dark time in my life, my intention was to create something extremely defiant and provocative because I was angry and still hadn\u2019t processed the trauma that had occurred in my own life,\u201d she released in a statement.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s clear how explicitly twisted my thinking was at the time. If I could go back and have a talk with my younger self I\u2019d tell her to go through the therapy I have since then, so that I could understand the confused post-traumatic state that I was in \u2013 or if therapy was not available to me or anyone in my situation \u2013 to seek help, and speak as openly and honestly as possible about what we\u2019ve been through.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t go back, but I can go forward and continue to support women, men, and people of all sexual identities, and of all races, who are victims of sexual assault.\u201d\n\nCheck out the full statement below.\n\nI stand by anyone who has ever been the victim of sexual assault: pic.twitter.com/67sz4WpV3i \u2014 Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) January 10, 2019\n\nGaga shows bravery and resilience in being the first artist to remove an R. Kelly collaboration from an album. This now places important pressure on other artists to follow suit.\n\nREAD MORE Lady Gaga Vows To Remove Her R.
