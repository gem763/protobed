It seems clear to me that the current regulations under this government are inadequate,' he said.\n\nDogs pictured being kept in near darkness at a puppy farm in Wales investigated on the programme. All the farms had got their licences from local authorities\n\nFilming in the darkness at one of the puppy farms, a group of puppies were also shown huddling together for warmth\n\nThe Welsh government has said it will review breeding regulations following the programme.\n\nAnimal charity Hope Rescue launched a petition calling on the Welsh government to review dog breeding in Wales which has so far gathered 3,979 signatures.\n\nBBC Wales Investigates broadcast its programme, put together after 12 months of investigation, last week.", "description": "WARNING: DISTRESSING CONTENT Horrifying footage taken in Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion, Wales, shows puppies huddling together for warmth and a decomposing dog corpse.", "authors": ["Luke Andrews For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/18/19407880-0-image-a-4_1570471057849.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
