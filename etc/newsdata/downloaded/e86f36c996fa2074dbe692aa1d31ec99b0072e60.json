No American president has been ousted from office in that fashion, though President Nixon resigned in 1974 while facing such a scenario.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe decision to prevent the U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland from testifying emerged Tuesday morning.\n\nIt will fuel concerns that the president and his allies have something to hide, and Democrats wasted no time making that case.\n\nThe upside for Trump is that the stymieing of Sondland could slow the inquiry down and suppress \u2014 for now \u2014 any damaging information in the ambassador\u2019s possession.\n\nSondland was one of several U.S. diplomats involved in talks regarding Ukraine.\n\nAt the heart of the current furor is a July 25 phone call in which Trump pressed the president of Ukraine to mount an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenPelosi hits back at Trump over letter: 'Only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy' Clinton jokes she could 'obviously' beat Trump in 2020 'rematch' Gowdy in talks to join Trump's impeachment defense team MORE, who is a leading 2020 presidential contender, and his son Hunter.\n\nIn texts that emerged last week, Sondland insisted to another U.S. official that there was no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d linking military aid to Ukraine with such an investigation. But he also told that other official \u2014 William Taylor, the U.S. charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in Ukraine \u2014 to stop discussing the matter via text.\n\nSondland had been due to testify before three House committees on Tuesday but those plans were undone by instructions from the State Department at the last minute.\n\nA statement from Sondland\u2019s lawyer, Robert Luskin, asserted that he was \u201cprofoundly disappointed\u201d and that he \u201cstands ready to testify on short notice, whenever he is permitted to appear.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHouse Democrats almost immediately announced they would seek to subpoena Sondland.\n\nOthers in the party argue the administration has miscalculated its response since, they say, the blocking of Sondland looks so suspicious.\n\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t buying this.

Brad Blakeman, a veteran of President George W. Bush\u2019s White House and a strong supporter of the current president, told The Hill that Trump was \u201cright to push back,\u201d adding that the administration should not \u201cplay into the hands of this kangaroo court.\u201d\n\nRep.

The other is contempt of Congress,\u201d Lichtman said, noting that the latter charge was one that President Nixon also faced.\n\nHarry Litman, a former deputy assistant attorney general, said the decision to prevent Sondland from testifying \u201cstrikes me as obstructive conduct.\u201d\n\nLitman also noted how the decision to stop the testimony came at the 11th hour.\n\n\u201cI think it is a distinct possibility that he was being prepared to testify and the preparers realized it would be a debacle so they told the White House,\u201d he speculated.\n\nWhether that is true or not, the haste with which Sondland was blocked appears to have caused consternation even among Trump loyalists.\n\nBloomberg reported on Tuesday evening that key Republicans were \u201cblindsided\u201d by the decision and asked the president to ensure such a thing did not happen again.\n\nSuch message coordination could be the least of Trump\u2019s worries, however, if public opinion continues to shift against him or more damning revelations emerge.\n\nThe Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage, primarily focused on Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.", "description": "The Trump administration rolled the dice on impeachment Tuesday, stopping a U.S. ambassador from testifying to Congress and blasting top Democrats in an open letter.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_100819getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
