Neither had he tried salad, rice or any dish containing a sauce, such as lasagne or curry. Fruit, other than apples, was also off the menu.\n\n(Image: Press Association)\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t like all these foods, I was actually scared of them,\u201d Scott, 39, recalls. \u201cIt was the texture that put me off and a fear of being sick.\n\n\u201cI would say \u2018I won\u2019t be able to swallow it\u2019. I remember someone once persuading me to try porridge and I had the gag reflex as I put it in my mouth. I was like that with a lot of foods.\n\n\u201cI look back now and think of the \u00adseriously good meals I could have \u00adexperienced, but in those days I just couldn\u2019t enjoy it. The rest of the band would get frustrated.\u201d\n\nScott resorted to filling his suitcase with tins of Heinz tomato soup when they went on tour. \u201cIf the other guys went out for dinner I\u2019d stay in my room,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d go into the hotel kitchens and ask them to warm it up for me, but I\u2019d stand over them to make sure they didn\u2019t put anything else into it. I didn\u2019t even try pepper until I was 24.\u201d\n\nA key issue with ARFID is that sufferers can\u2019t stand the texture, smell, taste or appearance of certain foods.\n\nThe fear is often so severe it causes a physiological constriction of the mouth, throat and digestive tract. It is often triggered by a distressing experience with food, such as choking or vomiting, and Scott believes that\u2019s what happened to him.\n\n\u201cWhen I was seven I liked tuna \u00adsandwiches, but only made with vinegar,\u201d he remembers.\n\n\u201cMy Nan made me some with vinegar and she also made my Granddad some with salad cream. He swapped one, thinking it wouldn\u2019t matter, and when I bit into the one with salad cream I was violently sick. I\u2019m still scared of salad cream now.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nScott\u2019s parents tried to tempt him by putting new foods on his plate, but he steadfastly refused to try them. Their fears grew when he joined 5ive aged 18.\n\n\u201cObviously then there was nothing they could do,\u201d he says. \u201cI was the other side of the world and \u00adstruggling to eat. I was skinny and I remember on one occasion I met them halfway through a tour and when I arrived at the airport they looked at me in shock \u2013 I'd lost so much weight.\n\n\u201cThe problem was a buffet would be laid on for us. I wouldn\u2019t like anything and there wasn\u2019t time for me to order something different as we\u2019d need to move on to the next place, be it a radio station or a gig.\u201d\n\nWhen Scott married his wife Kerry in 2005, things failed to improve. \u201cFor breakfast I\u2019d have Coco Pops, lunch would be beans on white toast with a little bit of cheese, and dinner would be a plain burger with chips or a plain steak with mashed potato.\u201d\n\nThe couple, who live in Essex, have four children, sons Brennan, 18 and Kavan, 13, and five-year-old twin girls Bobbi-Raye and Kayde-Rose, who all enjoy a varied diet.\n\n\u201cKerry didn\u2019t want the kids to be the same as me,\u201d Scott says.\n\n\u201cThe girls eat everything. For a little while the boys would copy me, but then they started eating everything.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago Kerry had hypnosis to conquer a severe fear of flying and Scott decided to book a session to see if it would help him with his food phobia.\n\n\u201cI was approaching 40 and I thought \u2018enough is enough\u2019,\u201d he explains.\n\nWhile sceptical, after five sessions he was able to order a curry for the first time. \u201cIt had sauce and onions in it. These were things I wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of putting on my plate, let alone in my mouth,\u201d he recalls.\n\n\u201cThe difference has been incredible. Now, even if I still don\u2019t like certain foods I\u2019m no longer scared of trying most things.\u201d\n\n(Image: DAILY MIRROR)\n\nScott now eats lasagne, veg such as carrots and peas, and home-made leek and potato soup. \u201cIn a ridiculous way I feel proud of myself,\u201d he smiles.\n\nHe is now considering returning to hypnotherapy as not all of his fears are conquered. \u201cI can\u2019t touch mayonnaise or salad cream and I think I\u2019d vomit if I ate prawns or any seafood,\u201d he says.\n\nScott has suffered no health issues as a result of his restricted diet, but wishes more had been known about the \u00adcondition as he was growing up, enabling him to get help earlier.\n\nHe says: \u201cI wish it hadn\u2019t just been, \u2018oh Scott\u2019s a fussy eater\u2019. I wish I had known there was something causing it,\u201d he says.\n\nIn recent years 5ive have reformed and next year head out on a 30-date The Boys Are Back Tour, alongside boy bands 911, A1 and Damage.\n\nOne of the pleasures for Scott is he can now sit down and eat dinner with his bandmates.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t tell them I was having \u00adhypnotherapy,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were doing a gig in Scotland and we had a buffet and I put some chilli and rice on my plate. They stopped, open-mouthed as I shovelled it in.\u201d\n\n* For tickets for The Boys Are Back Tour go to https://nvite.com/community/theboysareback2020", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Scott Robinson suffered Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder, a newly diagnosed condition where sufferers can't stand the texture, smell, taste or appearance of certain foods", "authors": ["Sue Crawford", "Image", "Press Association", "Getty Images", "Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20578732.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Scott-Robinson-5ive.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
