It is now being double checked. He is now in the hands of Scottish police.\"\n\nEuropol is the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation which has helped in the eight-year hunt for De Ligonn\u00e8s.\n\nLast year police searched underground caves and abandoned potassium mines in the area around Roquebrune-sur-Argens, in the south of France, where De Ligonn\u00e8s was spotted by a CCTV camera in April 2011.\n\nHe had fled Nantes a few days earlier after neighbours reported not having seen any of the family for more than three weeks.\n\nDetectives who visited initially found a severed leg under the garden terrace, and then uncovered the bodies of those who had been killed.\n\nDe Ligonn\u00e8s originally came from Versailles, home of the pre-Revolutionary kings and queens of France, and was technically a count who could trace his lineage back generations.\n\n(Image: Maxppp/PA Images)\n\n(Image: Maxppp/PA Images)\n\nIn confiscated emails he said that he considered himself to be part of a Roman Catholic elite which was superior to \u2018the masses\u2019.\n\n\"I think I\u2019ve got a superiority complex, you could call it that,\" he wrote. \"But it\u2019s based on a simple observation: I belong to a group of people who are intelligent, determined, balanced and in good moral and physical health. Such people are rare compared to the masses.\"\n\nRecalling his strict, devout childhood, De Ligonn\u00e8s added: \"All my adolescence was devoted to religion and faith, under the influence of my grand-mother and mother. To such an extent that I did not rebel like other adolescents, nor indulge in drugs or run after girls.\"\n\nDe Ligonn\u00e8s was last seen on April 15 2011 when he left a budget hotel at Roquebrune-sur-Argens, abandoning his car there.\n\nHe was wearing a backpack as he strolled through a car park into the surrounding countryside, and was picked up by a camera.\n\nAn extensive search was carried out in the area between April and June 2011 and - acting on new information \u2013 police resumed it last year, but found nothing.\n\n(Image: Maxppp/PA Images)\n\nThere was a theory that De Ligonn\u00e8s may have committed suicide in the days after the slaughter, in which case police were searching for remains of his body.\n\nHowever, prosecutors had never ruled out the possibility that De Ligonn\u00e8s was living rough, or else is being hidden by members of his extended family, who own country homes around France.\n\nDe Ligonn\u00e8s\u2019s ancestors, who included the 19th Century poet Lamartine, originally lived in a southern province of France called the Rouergue.\n\nFive months before the murders, De Ligonn\u00e8s said he had inherited a .22 rifle from his father and started target practice at a Nantes shooting club.\n\nReceipts found in his house also reveal that he bought a silencer, as well as a spade, a two-wheel trolley, chalk lime, and other equipment which could have been used to bury the bodies.\n\nIt also emerged that De Ligonn\u00e8s, who ran a number of internet businesses, had severe financial difficulties. Among those he had been asking for money was a mistress in Paris.", "description": "Xavier Dupont de Ligonn\u00e8s is said to have killed his wife and four children eight years ago but could now finally face justice", "authors": ["Peter Allen", "Sam Elliott", "Image", "Gamma-Rapho Via Getty Images", "Maxppp Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20564257.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Screen-Shot-2019-10-12-at-030239.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
