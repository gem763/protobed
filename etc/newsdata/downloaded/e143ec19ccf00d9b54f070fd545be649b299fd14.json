USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 It was at the Trump International Hotel.\n\nThat's where Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, huddled Wednesday with two foreign contacts who had been central to a campaign urging Ukrainian authorities to open an investigation into President Donald Trump\u2019s Democratic rival Joe Biden.\n\nBy dinner time, Giuliani\u2019s Ukrainian lunch partners, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were placed under arrest by FBI agents at Dulles International Airport, as they clutched one-way tickets to Frankfurt, Germany.\n\nWhat has since spilled from federal authorities and court documents are details of a tangled criminal inquiry highlighting the efforts of Parnas and Fruman to funnel huge caches of foreign money to U.S. political campaigns \u2013 a troubling narrative that now intersects with Congress\u2019 fast-moving inquiry into the impeachment of the president.\n\nWhile neither the president nor Giuliani were named in the new campaign finance case Thursday, the four-count indictment was unsealed as three House committees had scheduled depositions this week with Parnas and Fruman to learn how they may fit \u2013 if at all \u2013 in Trump\u2019s personal push this summer for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nThis Facebook screen shot provided by The Campaign Legal Center, shows President Donald Trump standing with Lev Parnas, top left photo, at the White House in Washington, posted on May 1, 2018. (Photo: AP)\n\nTrump late Thursday denied any involvement with the two men, brushing aside photographs posted on social media last year showing both men with Donald Trump Jr., and Parnas with the president, \u201cdescribing an \u201cincredible dinner and even better conversation.\u201d\n\n'I don't know those gentlemen': Trump denies knowing indicted Giuliani associates despite photos\n\nNo 'big deal': Trump downplays reports that Ukraine call notes were locked to avoid leaks\n\n\u201cNow, it\u2019s possible I have a picture with them because I have a picture with everybody,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2019 know about them. I don\u2019t know what they do. \u2026 Maybe they were clients of Rudy. You have to ask Rudy. I just don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nGiuliani declined to comment when reached by USA TODAY, but his association with Parnas and Fruman has brought new potential trouble to the doorstep of the White House, as Trump already is battling the greatest threat to his presidency in the form of the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry.\n\nParnas, Fruman drew scrutiny\n\nEven as Parnas and Fruman were drawing the scrutiny of Congress for arranging a January meeting in New York between Giuliani and Ukraine's then-prosecutor general, Yuri Lutsenko, as part of the campaign to launch an investigation into the Bidens, federal prosecutors in New York were taking aim at the pair for their suspicious movement of money to political campaigns in the U.S.\n\nThese images provided by the Alexandria Sheriff\u2019s Office show booking mugshots of Igor Fruman (left) and Lev Parnas, associates of Rudy Giuliani who were arrested on an indictment that includes charges of violating campaign finance laws. The men had key roles in Giuliani's efforts to launch a Ukrainian corruption investigation against Biden and his son, Hunter. (Photo: AP)\n\nWhat happened: Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases\n\nAccording to court documents unsealed Thursday, the dual interests of the Giuliani associates sometimes overlapped.\n\nAmong the beneficiaries of their largess, prosecutors allege, was a U.S. congressman who received $5,400 last year from the pair, who also pledged to raise $20,000 for the lawmaker as they sought to enlist him in an effort remove Marie Yovanovitch as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nIn his July 25 call to Zelensky, Trump makes an apparent disparaging reference to Yovanovitch, suggesting that she was ultimately recalled for criticizing the president. During the same call, he urged the Ukrainian president to work with Giuliani and U.S. Attorney General William Barr to assist in the investigation of the Bidens.\n\nA visual timeline: The events that led up to Trump's fateful phone call\n\nCLOSE Ukraine's Zelenskiy tours 9/11 Memorial AP Domestic\n\nThe congressman who received the political donations was not named in court documents, but a person familiar with the matter identified the lawmaker as former Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas.\n\nSessions wrote Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last year, urging the ouster of Yovanovitch, who was recalled in May.\n\nParnas and Fruman, however, made their biggest political splash last year when their company, Global Energy Producers, was credited with giving $325,000 to the committee that supports Trump's re-election, America First Action SuperPac.\n\nThe campaign contribution sparked a complaint to the Federal Election Commission\u2013and at least two lawsuits \u2013 because of questions about the source of the money. Citing the contribution Thursday, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, who announced the campaign finance charges, characterized the suspicious donation as one of the largest that the committee had received.\n\nAmerica First acknowledged on Thursday receiving the donation, adding that the committee also was aware of the FEC complaint.\n\n\"Accordingly, America First Action placed that contribution in a segregated bank account, it has not been used for any purpose and the funds will remain in this segregated account until these matters are resolved,\" the committee said in a statement.\n\nArrested, then subpoenaed\n\nAs the criminal case was unfolding against Parnas and Fruman Thursday, Congress also was pursuing them as witnesses in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nBoth men were scheduled to appear before the House Oversight, Intelligence and Foreign Affairs committees. Parnas had been scheduled Thursday and Fruman was slated to appear Friday.\n\nTurning up the heat, House Democrats issued subpoenas for the two men just hours after their arrests.\n\n\"Your clients are private citizens who are not employees of the Executive Branch,\" the chairmen of the House committees wrote to attorneys for Parnas and Fruman. \"They may not evade requests from Congress for documents and information necessary to conduct our inquiry.\"\n\nThe subpoena demands documents related to Ukraine by Oct. 16. It does not outline an exact date for the men to appear before the panels, saying only that \"the committees also expect your clients to appear to testify about these matters at a later date.\"\n\nBy Thursday afternoon, however, Parnas and Fruman, whose Wednesday lunch with Giuliani was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, were in no position to tend to Congress' demands.\n\nDuring a brief federal court hearing in Alexandria, Virginia, a judge set bail at $1 million for each defendant, demanding that both submit to electronic monitoring before they would be released from custody. The case is expected to move to a federal court in New York, where the charges were first filed Thursday.\n\nBefore the day's end, however, New York FBI chief William Sweeney and Berman \u2013 a Trump appointee \u2013 sounded a decidedly ominous note, saying that the investigation had not ended with with the arrests of Parnas and Fruman.\n\n\"This investigation is about corrupt behavior and deliberate law breaking,\" Sweeney said before both officials abruptly left a New York stage without taking questions.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/11/giuliani-associates-arrest-ukraine-trump-cloud/3936877002/", "description": "A criminal case against associates of Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer, competes with the impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Kevin Johnson", "Bart Jansen", "Published A.M.
