Few defended Mr. Trump\u2019s declaration on Thursday that China, as well as Ukraine, should investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a leading Democratic presidential candidate, and his son Hunter Biden.\n\n\u201cFewer still have commented on text messages released as part of Democrats\u2019 inquiry that show that envoys representing Mr. Trump sought to leverage the power of his office to prod Ukraine into opening investigations that would damage his Democratic opponents \u2014 and that some of them viewed it as a clear quid pro quo.\u201d NYT\n\n-- A NEW GOP TALKING POINT?

RON JOHNSON (R-Wis.) over attacking the press and pushing conspiracy theories. TODD: \u201cCan we please answer the question I asked you instead of trying to make Donald Trump feel better here that you're not criticizing him?\" Watch here\n\n-- GEORGE STEPHANOPOLOUS interviewed House Caucus Chairman HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-N.Y.) on ABC\u2019S \u201cTHIS WEEK\u201d: STEPHANOPOULOS: \u201cSo you think there's enough evidence to impeach right now?\u201d JEFFRIES: \u201cNo, I'm not saying that. There's enough evidence to proceed with the serious nature of the impeachment inquiry that is under way. At the end of the process, we're just going to follow the facts. We're going to apply the law. We're going to be guided by the Constitution. And we're going to see where that leads in order to present the truth to the American people.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: \u201cWe saw Jon Karl report that the White House is saying they're not going to comply with subpoenas until there is that formal House vote. Why not call their bluff? And if they do, indeed, refuse to comply with the subpoenas, is that an obstruction article?\u201d\n\nJEFFRIES: \u201cWell, Chairman Schiff and Chairman Engel and Chairman Cummings have made clear that the failure to comply with a lawfully issued congressional subpoena undermines a congressionally and constitutionally mandated process as it relates to the impeachment inquiry and itself could lead to a negative inferences as relates to the information that's being hidden.\n\n\u201cAnd the question has to be asked, if Donald Trump has nothing to hide, why does he continue to hide information, hide documents, hide evidence from the American people?\u201d More from Rishika Dugyala\n\nA message from Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women: Empowered women lift their entire communities, and we believe that creating opportunity leads to more opportunity.

Would you vote to support such an inquiry if you were in the House of Representatives?\u201d\n\nSANFORD: \u201cYou know, I don't know. I suspect so. Again, I think we need to take this incrementally. I mean, I think, to your point, there ought to be a vote before we go into the inquiry. If you look at the last three impeachments -- and, in fact, one in which I actually took the vote -- you formalize the process, as opposed to having an open-ended process, which is the route that Pelosi is taking right now.\u201d\n\nWALSH: \u201cI don't understand that, with all due respect, Mark. This president deserves to be impeached. Jake, nobody from the White House and no high-level Republicans are on this show today because there is nothing to defend. This president betrayed his country again this week. Would I vote if I were in Congress on the inquiry? There is enough we know now to vote to impeach this president.\u201d\n\nJOE BIDEN in WaPo editorial: \u201cEnough is enough. Every day \u2014 every few hours, seemingly \u2014 more evidence is uncovered revealing that President Trump is abusing the power of the presidency and is wholly unfit to be president. He is using the highest office in the land to advance his personal political interests instead of the national interest.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s most recent violation of the rule of law \u2014 openly calling for China to interfere in our elections, as he stood on the South Lawn of the White House \u2014 is so outrageous, it\u2019s clear he considers the presidency a free pass to do whatever he wants, with no accountability.\u201d WaPo\n\nJOSH GERSTEIN: \u201cJudge orders White House to preserve records of Trump's dealings with foreign leaders\u201d: \u201cA federal judge has ordered the White House to preserve a wide range of evidence about President Donald Trump\u2019s dealings with foreign leaders, including his interactions related to Ukraine that have fueled an impeachment investigation in the House.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued the order Thursday, directing that White House officials not destroy records of \u201cmeetings, phone calls, and other communications with foreign leaders.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe judge\u2019s order also appears to specifically address reports that the Trump White House set up a special system to limit access to certain records of presidential conversations with foreign leaders. Jackson, an appointee of President Barack Obama, instructed the White House to preserve \u201call records of efforts by White House or other executive branch officials to return, \u2018claw back,\u2019 \u2019lock down\u2019 or recall White House records\u201d about dealings with foreign officials.\n\n2020 WATCH \u2026\n\n-- THE STATE OF PLAY: \u201cUncertainty takes over the lead in the Democratic presidential race,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Michael Scherer and Matt Viser: \u201cThe top fundraiser in the Democratic presidential field was hospitalized with a heart attack, the longtime polling leader and his son sit at the center of an impeachment inquiry, and the one candidate with clear momentum faces persistent doubts among some party leaders that she is too liberal to win the general election.\n\n\u201cWith breathtaking speed, the events of the past two weeks have created huge uncertainty for the candidates who have dominated the Democratic nomination race, shaking a party desperate to defeat President Trump next year and deeply fearful of any misstep that risks reelecting a president many Democrats see as dangerously unfit for office.\u201d WaPo\n\n-- \u201cTop Biden Donors Gather Amid Storm Clouds Over Campaign,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Shane Goldmacher in Philadelphia\n\nTRUMP\u2019S SUNDAY -- The president has nothing on his public schedule.\n\nPLAYBOOK READS\n\nPHOTO DU JOUR: Anti-government protesters in Baghdad, Iraq, set fires and close a street during a Saturday demonstration.

The Trump hotel is the most popular place in Washington for political fund-raisers, although unlike other spots that pride themselves on bipartisan service, only Republican committees and groups spend money here.\n\n\u201cThe biggest spenders have been the Republican National Committee and America First Action, a Republican super PAC. Supporters of Representative Greg Pence, an Indiana Republican who is the vice president\u2019s brother, spent more than $30,000 at the hotel raising money for his campaign.
