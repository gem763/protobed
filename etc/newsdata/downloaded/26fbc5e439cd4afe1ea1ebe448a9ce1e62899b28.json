REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File Photo\n\nBERLIN (Reuters) - Zalando (ZALG.DE), Europe\u2019s biggest online-only fashion retailer, announced plans on Wednesday to cut its emissions of carbon dioxide, eliminate single-use plastics in packaging and make its ZIGN private label more sustainable.\n\nMany fashion players are trying to bolster their environmental credentials as the sector faces criticism for fueling a throwaway culture, with global charity Oxfam saying it is responsible for about 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\u201cThe fashion industry is facing sustainability challenges and we know we have been part of the problem. Going forward, our aspiration is to be part of the solution,\u201d Zalando co-Chief Executive Rubin Ritter said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe see a clear link between acting sustainably and continued commercial success... We believe that it will be a competitive advantage in the future.\u201d\n\nZalando said it wanted to be \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d in its own operations and all deliveries and returns as of today, including self-operated properties, parcel transportation and packaging.\n\nIt switched to over 90% renewable energy at its own buildings this year and said it would offset remaining carbon emissions that could not be eliminated in its operations.\n\nCarbon offsetting involves helping to fund a cut in emissions elsewhere, such as through preventing deforestation.\n\nZalando pledged to design its packaging to minimize waste and eliminate single-use plastics by 2023, noting that its boxes are already made from recycled materials.\n\nBy the launch of the 2020 spring/summer collection, the ZIGN label will be repositioned as a \u201csustainable\u201d brand and flagged as such online, aiming to meet international standards for social, environmental and animal welfare practices.", "description": "Zalando , Europe's biggest online-only fashion retailer, announced plans on Wednesday to cut its emissions of carbon dioxide, eliminate single-use plastics in packaging and make its ZIGN private label more sustainable.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446474549&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0LG", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
