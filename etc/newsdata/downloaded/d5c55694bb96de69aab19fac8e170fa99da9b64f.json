The SDF have been key US allies in the battle against the Islamic State (IS) group but Turkey regards their dominant Kurdish militias as terrorists.\n\nMany in the US, including some of Mr Trump's Republican allies, saw the withdrawal as effectively giving a green light for Turkey, although Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday denied this. The SDF said they had been \"stabbed in the back\".\n\nMr Trump tweeted on Thursday that he was trying to end \"endless wars\" but added: \"I say hit Turkey very hard financially & with sanctions if they don't play by the rules! I am watching closely.\" He also said he was \"talking to both sides\".\n\nThe offensive has drawn international condemnation. The UN Security Council is due to discuss it on Thursday at the request of its current five EU members - the UK, France, Germany, Belgium and Poland.\n\nTurkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has strongly defended the incursion, threatening to send the Syrian refugees it hosts to Europe if the Turkish offensive is described as an occupation.\n\nWhat is happening on the ground?\n\nKurdish sources report a large ground offensive between the towns of Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad, in the central area of Syrian's northern border with Turkey.\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian rebels from the Free Syrian Army have also been involved in the fighting.\n\nThe area is sparsely populated and mainly inhabited by Arabs. Ras al-Ain has been hit by numerous air strikes.\n\nTurkey's defence ministry said on Twitter that its operation had continued successfully on land and in the air. Reports say a number of villages east of Tal Abyad were captured.\n\nMr Erdogan said 109 militants had been killed, injured or captured in the initial fighting. The SDF said the figure was an exaggeration.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Some residents began to flee as smoke rose over the town of Ras al-Ain\n\nThe UK-based monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said at least 16 SDF fighters had been killed and dozens more injured.\n\nThe Kurdish Red Crescent said at least seven civilians had so far been killed, two of them children, and at least 19 more critically injured, including four children.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory said more than 60,000 people had fled since the offensive began, with the towns of Ras al-Ain and Darbasiya largely deserted.\n\nKurdish authorities accused Turkey of shelling a prison holding IS inmates in Qamishli in the east of the border region in a \"clear attempt\" to help them escape.\n\nThe BBC's Orla Guerin also says that at least three rounds of what appeared to be retaliatory Kurdish artillery fire hit the main street of the Turkish town of Akcakale, killing at least one resident.\n\nWhat resistance can the Kurdish-led forces offer?\n\nThe SDF currently number about 40,000 fighters, with tens of thousands of others in parallel Kurdish security services, Kurdish sources say.\n\nThe US joint task force on operations against IS in Iraq and Syria describes them as \"tenacious fighters with a degree of basic military training to function as infantrymen\".\n\nBut they are deficient in heavy weaponry that could be used against tanks or aircraft, though some units may have anti-tank missiles.\n\nIn operations against IS, they relied on close coalition air support but in the flat, open country of Syria's northern border they will be vulnerable to air and artillery attack.\n\nTurkey considers the Kurdish YPG militia - the dominant force in the SDF - an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party, which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for three decades.\n\nTransactional alliances\n\nOn Wednesday, President Trump told a news conference the Turks and Kurds had \"been fighting each other for centuries\" and that Kurdish fighters \"didn't help us in the Second World War, they didn't help us with [the D-Day landings in] Normandy\".\n\nEven by President Trump's own remarkable standards this off-the-cuff remark playing down the US alliance with the Kurds is extraordinary.\n\nFor Mr Trump alliances are simply transactional - business arrangements to be judged according to a brutal and short-term cost benefit analysis. What is the US giving and what is it getting in return?\n\nIn seemingly writing off the Kurds he suggests that the US can easily find other allies in the region. Really? Has he already forgotten recent history? The Kurds were the only capable and reliable local ally in the struggle against IS.\n\nBut what will Mr Trump do about Turkey who, incidentally, were not at Normandy either? This is fast becoming a major test of Turkey's standing within Nato, with many fearing it has become a far from reliable ally of the West.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump: Kurds \"didn't help us in Second World War\"\n\nHow is the incursion affecting the IS situation?\n\nThe SDF say they are holding more than 12,000 suspected IS members in seven prisons, and at least 4,000 of them are foreign nationals. The exact locations have not been revealed, but some are reportedly close to the Turkish border.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Inside the camp of IS families in Syria\n\nTwo camps - Roj and Ain Issa - holding families of suspected IS members are inside the \"safe zone\". It is unclear whether the Kurds will continue to guard the prisons as fighting breaks out.\n\nThe US military says it has taken custody of two British detainees notorious for their roles in an IS cell that tortured and killed nearly 30 Western hostages.\n\nThe two men, El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey, were part of a British cell nicknamed The Beatles.\n\nThey have now been removed from a prison run by the Kurdish-led militia in northern Syria.\n\nAre you in the affected area?
