But despite this massive presence... the terrorist groups... are growing stronger.\"\n\nUntil 2015, landlocked Burkina Faso was largely spared violence that hit Mali and then Niger, its neighbours to the north.\n\nBut jihadists -- some linked to Al-Qaeda, others to the so-called Islamic State group -- started infiltrating the north, then the east, and then endangered its southern and western borders.\n\nCombining guerrilla hit-and-run tactics with road mines and suicide bombings, the insurgents have killed nearly 600 people, according to a toll compiled by AFP. Civil society groups put the tally at more than 1,000.\n\nAround 300,000 people have fled their homes and almost 3,000 schools have closed. The impact on an overwhelmingly rural economy is escalating, disrupting trade and markets.", "description": "Sixteen people died and two were seriously injured in an attack on a mosque in Burkina Faso's volatile north, security sources said Saturday.Armed men...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/17/wire-19631432-1570899467-286_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
