RWC100: 80-61 1/21 Which Rugby World Cup star will come out on top? 2/21 80: Israel Dagg A double-World Cup winner who made the full-back berth his own as the All Blacks cemented their dominance at the top of world rugby. Getty Images 3/21 79: Wayne Shelford One of the greats from the originals, Shelford played in six of seven games as the All Blacks won the 1987 Rugby World Cup. Remembered as the man who revitalised the Haka, his legacy in the sport will go on long after he is gone. Getty Images 4/21 78: Jeremy Guscott Guscott featured in three World Cup campaigns, the first two of which produced a final and semi-final appearance. He could have added to that record had injury not ended his 1999 campaign, where an England side without him crashed out. Getty Images 5/21 77: Serge Betsen A formidable opponent who was highly respected by his opponents, such was his talent. However, he features low on the list due to featuring at just one World Cup due to injury. AFP/Getty Images 6/21 76: Brian Lima 'The Chiropractor' by name, Brian Lima was a World Cup force to be reckoned with - just ask Derick Hougaard. The centre became the first player ever to appear at five Rugby World Cups, starring at the 1991, 1995, 1999, 2003 and 2007 tournaments, and was inducted into the Hall of Fame four years later. AFP/Getty Images 7/21 75: Tony Daly The Australian was a key part of the victorious 1991 Wallabies side and also featured at the 1995 campaign. Getty Images 8/21 74: Alun Wyn Jones The veteran lock will feature at his fourth World Cup in Japan since his first appearance in 2007, and was a key part of Wales's run to the semi-finals in 2011. Getty 9/21 73: Brad Thorn The lock was a linchpin in the 2011 Rugby World Cup-winning New Zealand side, starting all but one of the games including the final against France, and he also played at the 2003 event eight years before, though missed out on the 2007 tournament. Getty Images 10/21 72: Jannie de Beer Killed off England's hopes in 1999 with his memorable five drop-goals in the quarter-final, writing his name into World Cup folklore. Getty Images 11/21 71: Fourie du Preez The scrum-half was South Africa's starting No 9 for three World Cup in a row, an was instrumental in their kick-heavy strategy at the 2007 World Cup that saw the Springboks defeat England in the final. Getty Images 12/21 70: Mils Muliaina The 100-cap full-back was a mainstay of the All Blacks side tat went through the toil of the 2003 and 2007 World Cups, only to secure a fitting farewell by winning the 2011 tournament. A lethal finisher who also had the defensive craft to match, Muliaina was the standout No 15 for much of the noughties. Getty Images 13/21 69: Thierry Dusautoir Inspired France's 2011 campaign when the players took control from coach Marc Lievremont and played the style of rugby they wanted to play. Dusautoir always led by example as one of the best No 7s to play the game. Getty Images 14/21 68: Owen Franks A two-time World Cup winner who proved pivotal to the All Blacks' back-to-back triumphs. Franks changed the game with how tighthead props play, and was unlucky to miss out on a third tournament after being overlooked for 2019. Getty Images 15/21 67: Mike Tindall His brutal dump tackle on George Gregan in the 2003 final showed all the hallmarks of England's defiance in that campaign. Unlucky to miss the 2007 tournament with a broken leg, and although the less said about 2011 the better, his exploits in Australia eight years before cement his place on the list. Getty Images 16/21 66: Keven Mealamu Another member of the All Blacks' double-World Cup winners club, Mealamu was heralded for his performance off the bench in the 2015 final. Getty Images 17/21 65: Glen Osbourne Osborne's best displays of his career came at the Rugby World Cup, scoring five tries in six games across 1995 and 199. Getty Images 18/21 64: Rory Underwood Underwood starred for England at the first three World Cups, with the nation's all-time record try-scorer claiming 11 World Cup tries throughout his illustrious career. Getty Images 19/21 63: Josh Kronfeld One of the great back-row forwards of his generation, Kronfeld went through the agony of twice seeing New Zealand's World Cup aspirations fall short in 1995 and 1999, though it was through no lack of trying on his part. Getty Images 20/21 62: Brian O'Driscoll The lack of Irish players can easily be put down to their dismal knockout record, but O'Driscoll simply has to be on the list for his exploits across the 2003 and 2011 World Cups. For a player of his talent, his World Cup record is no doubt disappointing, but he remained a joy to watch. Getty Images 21/21 61: Willie Ofahengaue 'Willie O' was a giant of the game who helped the Wallabies to World Cup glory in 1991, leading the pack from No 8 with distinction. He retired with the rare accolade of having beaten the All Blacks more times than losing to them.
