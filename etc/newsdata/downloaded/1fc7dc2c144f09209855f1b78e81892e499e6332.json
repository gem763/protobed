Tell us what happened. Dish \u2014\n\nMCCARTHY: Well, this is how \u2014 OK, this is how it all starts. The president starts out and he provides the letter that he sent to the president of Turkey, Erdogan.\n\nINGRAHAM: Erdogan.\n\nMCCARTHY: Very strong letter, not to go into this area. As he passes it around, he starts with me, we hand to every leader. You know what the Speaker Pelosi did?\n\nINGRAHAM: What?\n\nMCCARTHY: She doesn\u2019t read it.
