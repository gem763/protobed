Those left off the register have 120 days to appeal at Foreigners Tribunals, and if they fail, they can appeal that decision through the courts.\n\nThe national government has stressed that those omitted will not become stateless.\n\nTouching on New Delhi's contentious move on August 5 to strip autonomy status from the part of Muslim-majority Kashmir it controls, Mr Shah stressed his government would not revoke another constitutional clause for several states - most in the northeast.\n\nThe Article 371 clause, which also covers Assam, is aimed at preserving the local culture of those states.\n\n\"I have clarified in parliament that this is not going to happen and I am saying it again today in Assam,\" he said.\n\nOpposition politicians had questioned Mr Modi's government on whether those special rights would also be scrapped after the Kashmir move.\n\nUnder its previous autonomy, Kashmiris enjoyed special privileges such as the sole right to own land or take government jobs and university scholarships.\n\nNew Delhi has yet to lift a strict lockdown in the restive valley imposed just ahead of the decision to prevent any outbreaks of unrest.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [NEW DELHI] India's home affairs minister on Sunday said his government \"will not allow a single illegal immigrant to stay\", as he visited Assam state where a controversial citizenship register sparked uproar from the almost two million people excluded. .
