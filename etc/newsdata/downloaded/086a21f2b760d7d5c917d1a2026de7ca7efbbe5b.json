It was about a six-or-eight-inch drop,\" said Lougheed.\n\n\"I have no peripheral vision. I could have easily driven over that and not seen it. And people with low vision or who are blind could have easily fallen over it.\"\n\nAn OC Transpo worker assists a man inside the Parliament light rail station on Sept. 14, 2019.

(Andrew Lee/CBC)\n\n'I was very happy'\n\nRyan Lythall, on the other hand, was impressed when he rode the line this weekend.\n\nHe said he found the elevators a decent size and pretty fast. He also said the public washrooms were large enough to fit his power chair.\n\n\"I was very happy,\" said Lythall. \"I was very surprised.\"\n\nI took a ton of pics and videos from today's LRT launch.

He also said he'd like to see larger buttons on the elevators.\n\n\"Some people with dexterity problems like myself, you have to be kind of right on,\" Brown said. \"Some people may have trouble with that.\"\n\nBob Brown says he finds the new LRT system quite accessible, but still sees room to improve. (Ryan Garland/CBC)\n\n'Ambassadors' offering help\n\nIn a written response, the City of Ottawa said fare gates have been designed to accommodate people with mobility issues, with wider gates having two card readers at different heights so that riders can choose the one that's best.\n\nVisual and audio feedback will let customers know their fare was successfully accepted, the statement said.\n\nThe city also said Sunday that \"O-Train ambassadors\" are at all LRT stations to help riders access the line. Staff are also available to help show disabled riders how to best use LRT, and \"support persons\" can accompany them on-board for free as long as they've applied for the proper pass.\n\nThe city said it's currently assessing feedback from riders, and encouraged people to share concerns or questions with on-site staff.", "description": "When it comes to accessibility, the early reviews for Ottawa's new LRT system are mixed.", "authors": ["Krystalle Ramlakhan Is A Multi-Platform Journalist With Cbc Ottawa.
