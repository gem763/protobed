Ben Cregan\n\nThis contradicts earlier comments from Deloitte's managing partner of audit and assurance, Jamie Gatt, that ASIC's inspection regime was \"not fit for purpose\".\n\n\"We are on record in saying that we do not believe individual inspection reports provide an accurate picture. The approach by ASIC can and has resulted in significant volatility in results,\" he told The Australian Financial Review earlier this year.\n\nDeloitte's audit inspection findings were the poorest of the big four firms in ASIC's latest report, with the regulator finding its auditors had not done enough to ensure the financial statements they were reviewing were free of error in 14 of 44 key audit areas.\n\n\"Audit is not a journey with a fixed destination but something we work on constantly to improve,\" its submission said.\n\nThe accounting giant also reiterated arguments made by the other big four firms that multidisciplinary firms are better equipped to audit complex clients.\n\nIt said potential conflicts of interest and auditor independence was already governed by \"extensive laws and standards\" but called for more clarity are categories of service (audit, audit related services, assurance services and non-audit services) and increased transparency in listed entity reports.\n\n\"This would mean the market could consider audit-related and other assurance services and fees separately from other non-audit services and fees,\" the submission said.", "description": "The big four firm said firms could provide both audit and non-audit advice without losing any independence, even though the dual roles it played at NAB is widely considered a trigger of an inquiry into audit quality.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/81db378f7d8867e12e3278858cc757b8d1966ef8", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
