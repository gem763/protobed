Because all she does is glow.\n\n\"Abdicate. Off you go.\n\n\"She wears bad clothes, when did we ask for that?\"\n\n(Image: Channel 9/PA)\n\nFinding Katie's comments confusing - as many would not deem them insulting - Twitter users defended Meghan on the micro-blogging website.\n\n\"Imagine being Katie Hopkins and having the audacity to call out Meghan Markle for 'wearing bad clothes,'\" wrote a perplexed Twitter user.\n\nAnother puzzled person added: \"What is she really...she's a no one, she's a divorcee, she wears bad clothes!\n\n(Image: Channel 9/PA)\n\n\"All this from a divorcee, who sh**s married men in fields, looks like she got dressed in the dark, is on the brink of bankruptcy and a nasty b***h on Twitter to boot #MeghanMarkle #KatieHopkins.\"\n\nOne shared: \"She wears bad clothes says b***y katie hopskins, who dresses like a housewife who buys bad cheap second hand clothes from a charity clothes shop. Meghan Markle dresses beautifully, stylish.\"\n\n\"Meghan markle is minding her own business still glowing unlike Katie Hopkins who is a hating ass WRINKLY B***H.\"\n\n\"I truly believe Australia\u2019s pitiful Katie Hopkins has an inferiority complex and feels extremely threatened by the beautiful , talented , sparkling, charismatic and absolutely glowing Meghan Markle. What else would yu expect from a jealous audience,\" mused another.\n\nAnother defended Meghan, by writing: \"Katie hopkins out here looking like a burnt chicken and being mad for the 172838th time over the fact meghan markle is glowing like the princess she is.\"\n\n(Image: Channel 9/PA)\n\nThe Australian programme references criticism Prince Harry and Meghan received last month for taking four private planes in just 11 days as they travelled to Ibiza and Nice for luxury holidays with son Archie.\n\nHopkins adds in the clip: \"Meghan Markle is the biggest hypocrite there is.\"\n\nDuring the show, the rent-a-gob goes to Buckingham Palace to speak to well-wishers and fans outside.\n\nWhen a tourist tells her \"there's nothing wrong with Meghan\", she puts her hands on her hips and replies: \"But then there's nothing right with her either.\"\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIt comes after fans the official Royal Family Twitter account liked a tweet calling out the Duchess of Sussex\u2019s critics.\n\nThe Tweet, which was liked by the account, read: \"\u201cThese anti-Meghan Markle trolls are all the same: they pine for \u2018the good old days.\u2019\n\n\u201cShe was genius to title her Vogue issue \u2018Forces for Change.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe are witnessing a seismic shift in power and culture, and her haters are furious and terrified.
