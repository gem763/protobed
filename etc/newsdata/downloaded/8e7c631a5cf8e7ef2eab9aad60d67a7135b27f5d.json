But he\u2019s in good company\n\nIs Sean Spicer the most controversial person ever to appear on a dancing show?\n\nName: Sean Spicer.\n\nAge: 47.\n\nAppearance: Divisive hoofer.\n\nI thought we had got rid of Spicer long ago. Me too. His time in the spotlight, as Donald Trump\u2019s communications director, was brief but intense. Remember when he lied about how many people attended Trump\u2019s inauguration? Remember when he hid \u201camong bushes\u201d to escape the press? Remember that time he sort of defended Hitler during a White House press briefing? What an absolute berk.\n\nSo why are we talking about him now? Because he\u2019s back, baby! Tonight Spicer makes his debut as a contestant on Dancing with the Stars, the American version of Strictly Come Dancing.\n\nReally? Sure, why not?\n\nBecause he\u2019s Sean Spicer. He was a figurehead of the Trump administration. He does not deserve to be normalised on a light-entertainment show. Yes, he does.\n\nPardon? Of course he does. This is what shows like Dancing with the Stars are for.\n\nAre you sure? Yes! Look, Spicer\u2019s fellow contestants are all relentlessly beige. There\u2019s James Van Der Beek (he of Dawson\u2019s Creek fame), there\u2019s Christie Brinkley, there\u2019s a supporting character from The Office. It\u2019s full of people you feel nothing for. At least Spicer makes you feel something.\n\nYes, blind hatred. It still counts. And it isn\u2019t even as if he\u2019s the most controversial contestant ever to take part in one of these shows.\n\nI\u2019m sure he is. No, he isn\u2019t. In 2006, Dancing with the Stars hired the rightwing pundit Tucker Carlson. In 2009, it hired the pro-gun former House majority leader Tom DeLay. A year later, it hired Sarah Palin\u2019s daughter. It hired one of Trump\u2019s ex-wives. It even hired Rick Perry, Trump\u2019s energy secretary. He actually makes bad decisions, rather than just parroting them.\n\nHow is Spicer going down? Terribly. After the lineup was announced, his fellow contestant Karamo Brown, of Queer Eye, described Spicer as a \u201cgood guy\u201d. The backlash was so profound that Brown had to delete his Twitter account. God knows what sort of chaos there will be if Spicer actually turns out to be good at dancing.\n\nWill he be good? Absolutely not. It will be a miracle if he doesn\u2019t get tangled up in a curtain and accidentally decapitate someone.\n\nSo his inclusion is just a bit of fun? That\u2019s right. Like when Ann Widdecombe appeared on Strictly Come Dancing.\n\nWas that fun? Yes! It turned her into a household name and she presented a quizshow, and then \u2026 oh, she was re-elected as a Brexit party MEP and used her platform to compare Brexit to slaves revolting against their owners. Oh God, this is a terrible idea.\n\nDo say: \u201cI won\u2019t watch Dancing with the Stars because Sean Spicer is a contestant.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t say: \u201cBut I\u2019ll be first in line when Eric Jr signs up.\u201d", "description": "The inclusion of Donald Trump\u2019s former press secretary in Dancing with the Stars is a step too far for some.
