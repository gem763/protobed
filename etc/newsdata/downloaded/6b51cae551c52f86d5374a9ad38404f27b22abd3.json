There was major confusion as it appeared as if VAR had ruled out the effort, but it was allowed to stand.\n\n\u201cWe made it difficult for ourselves,\u201d said Alli. \u201cWe controlled the game and bossed possession. It was my first start and great to be back in the team but overall a disappointing result.\n\n\u201cWe know we have a world-class team so it\u2019s about showing what we can do when things don\u2019t go our way. It\u2019s important we turn it around. We know how good we are, we just have to start showing it on the pitch.\u201d\n\nLeicester held a minute\u2019s silence before kick-off to remember their late owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who was killed in a helicopter crash at the stadium last October.\n\nChris Wood put Burnley in front but Leicester\u2019s in-form forward Jamie Vardy headed an equaliser just before half-time and Tielemans completed the turnaround with just over 15 minutes to go.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t play as well as we can and we couldn\u2019t get into our rhythm as much as we would have liked,\u201d said Leicester defender Jonny Evans.\n\n\u201cBut luckily Youri (Tielemans) got us our goal.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Leicester go second \u2013\n\nAhead of City\u2019s match at Crystal Palace later on Saturday, Leicester were second in the table, seven points behind leaders Liverpool, while Chelsea, also on 17 points, were third.\n\nMatt Targett scored a goal deep into injury time as Aston Villa came back from 1-0 down to beat 10-man Brighton 2-1.\n\nSouthampton took the lead against Wolves at Molineux, courtesy of a Danny Ings goal but were pegged back by a Raul Jimenez penalty while Bournemouth drew 0-0 at home to Norwich.\n\nIn the early kick-off on Saturday, Everton climbed out of the relegation zone with a well-deserved 2-0 victory against West Ham that eased the pressure on Marco Silva.\n\nA first-half goal from Brazil forward Bernard and a late second from substitute Gylfi Sigurdsson gave Everton the three points in a match in which they had 19 shots.\n\n\u201cIt was a fantastic performance,\u201d Sigurdsson told BT Sport. \u201cWe had a lot of chances, especially in the second half. You never know when it\u2019s 1-0 \u2014 you always want to get more.\n\n\u201cThey are dangerous going forward and their goalkeeper made some spectacular saves. I was pleased to come on and give us a bit of comfort. There was a real purpose to our game today.\u201d\n\nManchester City head to Crystal Palace in the late match on Saturday.\n\nPep Guardiola left Sergio Aguero and Riyad Mahrez out of his starting line-up but there was a place on the bench for defender John Stones after an injury lay-off.\n\nLiverpool travel to Old Trafford on Sunday, chasing a record-equalling 18th consecutive Premier League win while Manchester United are just one point above the relegation zone.\n\nArsenal face Sheffield United on Monday.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Tottenham narrowly avoided an embarrassing home defeat to bottom club Watford on Saturday as Chelsea and Leicester leapfrogged", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/64e567_tottenham-manager-mauricio-pochettino-is-struggling-turn-his-team-fortunes-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
