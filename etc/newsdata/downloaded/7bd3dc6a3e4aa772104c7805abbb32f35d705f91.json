Instead, they're pushing it out to ensure it was released with quality storylines, well-acted characters and a rich world to discover.\n\nVampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines 2 will launch later in 2020 than we planned. Simply put, we believe quality is more important than releasing in Q1. \u2014 Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 (@VtM_Bloodlines) October 16, 2019\n\n\"We have decided to value quality over making the Q1 launch window,\" the blog read. \"Over the last few months, it became clear that to stick to our original date would risk repeating that mistake. We won\u2019t do that. In the end, everyone working on this game wants to offer you the best Bloodlines 2 we can.\n\n\"Throughout 2019 we have been improving our processes and growing our teams, however it soon became clear that this alone won\u2019t allow us to deliver the quality we want at the date we promised.\"\n\nImage: Paradox Interactive\n\nBloodlines 2, as shown in gameplay trailers, will see an open world set in Seattle filled with various vampire races and blood-filled humans. You'll need to navigate the murky politics between vampire factions to make alliances and ensure a steady supply of blood without enraging a coven of blood-lust vamps.\n\nIt will come 16 years after the first Bloodlines was released, which was well-received despite being plagued with serious technical issues. Hardsuit Labs have said it intends to avoid making the same mistakes as the original release and plans on ensuring the sequel is as polished as possible on full release.", "description": "Developers at Hardsuit Labs have confirmed upcoming vampire RPG, Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2, is being delayed so you'll have to wait until late 2020 to experience the first day of the rest of your death....", "authors": ["Sarah Basford"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/k/2019/10/bloodlines2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
