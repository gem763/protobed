He is the author of several works of political history including, most recently, Republic of Spin: An Inside History of the American Presidency.\n\nThe internet is awash in historical explainers and hot takes trying to make sense of our sudden constitutional crisis. Marshalled on behalf of a range of competing viewpoints, the arguments are sprinkled with references to Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton\u2014the three presidents who faced impeachment proceedings before Donald Trump. Which one applies to the current president and his apparent effort to enlist Ukraine in going after Joe Biden, his potential opponent in the 2020 election?\n\nTurning to the past is understandable: A presidential impeachment cries out for historical context. The past is supposed to offer a map of sorts through what feels like an unfamiliar and treacherous adventure. But\u2014as historians, ironically, are sometimes the first ones to point out\u2014history isn\u2019t actually a very good guide here. We\u2019re in uncharted waters, and it\u2019s best that we recognize that.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhy do the Johnson, Nixon and Clinton examples offer us so little direct help today? Every impeachment poses two discrete sets of questions for the House and Senate to consider. First, there are constitutional questions: Are impeachment and conviction justified? Second, there are political questions: Are impeachment and conviction possible? With every previous presidential impeachment, the answers have been different, and in the case of Trump and Ukraine, the answers are different still. We\u2019ve simply never had a case before where the removal of a president was so well justified\u2014while at the same time so obviously unlikely to happen.\n\nThe 1868 impeachment of Johnson grew out of a power struggle between a reactionary president and the \u201cRadical Republicans\u201d who held power in Congress. Having assumed the White House after Abraham Lincoln\u2019s assassination, Johnson\u2014a Southerner who never left the union\u2014warred with Republicans over a series of bills dealing with civil rights for the newly freed slaves and the terms for readmitting secessionist states.\n\nThe conflict crested when the Republicans passed the Tenure of Office Act, a law of uncertain constitutionality that barred the president from firing a member of his Cabinet unless the Senate approved a successor. Annoyed by Congress\u2019 efforts to tie his hands, Johnson fired Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, a Lincoln administration holdover, without securing Senate approval\u2014creating a test case of the new legislation. Johnson\u2019s defiance provoked the House to swiftly pass 11 articles of impeachment, most of which dealt with the Tenure of Office Act.\n\nJohnson was duly impeached. But he ultimately dodged removal from office because moderate Republicans came to his aid in his Senate trial. With no vice president in place, his ouster would have awarded the presidency to Senate President Pro Tempore Benjamin Wade\u2014a fiery radical unloved by the moderates. Johnson sent word that he would relent in his fights with the Republicans if they let him stay in office, helping him to prevail by just one vote.\n\nIn Johnson\u2019s case, the constitutional questions\u2014are impeachment and conviction justified?\u2014were open to debate. Generally, historians today tend to think his impeachment wasn\u2019t warranted (even if they mostly agree that the Republicans were correct on Reconstruction policy). As for the political questions\u2014are impeachment and conviction possible?\u2014the narrowness of Johnson\u2019s acquittal makes clear that the undertaking was hardly doomed to futility. It was a meaningful exercise that could well have gone differently.\n\nA century later, the case of Nixon and Watergate furnished a different set of answers. The House Judiciary Committee didn\u2019t pass its articles of impeachment against Nixon until July 1974, a full two years (and one reelection campaign) after the failed burglary and bugging operation that began the unraveling of Nixon\u2019s vast dirty tricks machine. In those two intervening years, a Senate investigative committee\u2014along with the criminal trials of the apprehended burglars, and reporting by dogged journalists\u2014pried loose an avalanche of evidence about abuses of power and obstruction of justice in the White House that slowly but steadily shifted public opinion. Those counts, as well as one for Nixon\u2019s defiance of congressional subpoenas, were powerful enough to convince several Republicans to join the Democrats in supporting Nixon\u2019s ouster.\n\nIn Nixon\u2019s case, then, impeachment charges were clearly justified on constitutional grounds. And as Nixon discovered in August, when the Republicans\u2019 elder statesman, Barry Goldwater, led a delegation to the White House to tell the president he had lost almost all his fellow Republicans\u2019 support, conviction was not just possible but virtually assured. Politically, too, impeachment was a slam-dunk. Capitulating to reality, Nixon resigned before he could be impeached.\n\nClinton\u2019s impeachment a quarter-century later, for allegedly lying about his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, yielded still a different combination of answers. The probe of the president\u2019s sex life by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr was something of a rogue operation to begin with, since Starr had been appointed to look into a wholly discrete matter\u2014a real estate investment Clinton had made while governor of Arkansas (on which Starr could come up with no case for impeachment). From the start, Starr\u2019s inquiry lacked a fundamental legitimacy, and while many Washington pundits nonetheless cheered it on, majorities of the electorate saw it as a partisan, not a constitutional, undertaking.\n\nWas Clinton\u2019s removal from office ever a real possibility? Probably not. It is true that when news of his dalliance broke, some people thought his days were numbered. But within a matter of weeks, public opinion turned decisively against Starr and toward Clinton, where it would remain. After taking up impeachment in October, the House Republicans promptly lost congressional seats in the 1998 midterm elections\u2014an almost unheard-of development\u2014providing strong clues that their partisan crusade would founder in the Senate, where even some Republicans came to voice qualified support for the president. When Clinton finally won acquittal in February 1999, it seemed like a long-delayed foregone conclusion. The outcome drove home the recklessness of pursuing an impeachment that was bound to fail.\n\nSo, what precedent do these impeachment cases provide? Johnson\u2019s removal from office was possible but probably not justified (and thus ill-advised). Nixon\u2019s was both possible and justified (and thus effective). And Clinton\u2019s was neither possible nor justified (and thus farcical). Removing Trump from office over the Ukraine scandal would be different from all of these cases. Unlike in Clinton\u2019s case, the constitutional argument for it looks increasingly powerful: We have fairly damning evidence from the White House itself of a direct conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian president about going after Biden. But unlike in Johnson\u2019s and Nixon\u2019s situations, removal is all but guaranteed never to happen\u2014owing to the Republicans\u2019 strong majority in the Senate and a disciplined tribalism of a ferocity that simply didn\u2019t exist in the Nixon era.\n\nUntil now, many Democrats seemed to be reading the present through the past\u2014in particular through the lens of the Republicans\u2019 self-defeating anti-Clinton crusade. Their reading of history suggested that, given the sheer unlikelihood of actually dispatching Trump from the White House, it would be folly to press ahead with impeachment. That strategy seemed like a recipe for a bloody political fight, and even greater voter cynicism than we have now.\n\nOnly this past week did Democratic opinion dramatically shift. One reason seems to be an unwillingness to make the same mistake twice. Back in October 2016, evidence was mounting that Russia was meddling in the ongoing presidential election, along with suspicion that Trump\u2019s campaign was encouraging or welcoming the interference. While Hillary Clinton spoke out bluntly, the administration at the time dithered, with President Barack Obama warning Vladimir Putin to \u201ccut it out.\u201d Everyone assumed Trump would lose the election and saw no reason to raise needless alarms. But the Ukraine scandal starkly evokes 2016\u2014Trump seemed to have encouraged a foreign power to interfere on his behalf in an election\u2014and Democrats grasped that they couldn\u2019t run the same script as last time.\n\nStill, to say the Democrats felt it necessary to finally begin impeachment proceedings isn\u2019t to say the political risks are gone. Without any prospect of winning Republican supporters for Trump\u2019s ouster, the Democrats\u2019 ultimate objectives are troublingly unclear. Impeachment could galvanize voters against the president, but it could also backfire, as Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment did against Republicans. Or, like so much else in our polarized environment, it could just fail to move the needle.\n\nNo impeachment case in U.S. history yet has offered a perfect precedent. In fact, each one has reshaped our thinking about impeachment in the years afterward. The ill-advised impeachment of Johnson played a part in discouraging Congress from trying it again for more than 100 years. The successful revival of the impeachment machinery to use against Nixon, conversely, emboldened Republicans to try it against Clinton. And the abuse of the process against Clinton until now had deterred Democrats from using it against Trump. Whether the proceedings against Trump will open the floodgates to ever-more promiscuous uses of impeachment or serve to restrict its use only to the gravest of circumstances is unknowable. But one way or another, it is likely to redefine our politics for years to come.", "description": "History isn\u2019t a good guide for today\u2019s turmoil.", "authors": ["John F.
