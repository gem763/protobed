REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke\n\nCROSS-BORDER FLOWS\n\nThe United Kingdom imports around 5-6 percent of its electricity via power links with France, Holland and Ireland, while around 40 percent of the country\u2019s gas supply comes via Norwegian and EU pipelines.\n\nIf the United Kingdom leaves the EU without a deal it will no longer be part of the EU\u2019s Internal Energy Market (IEM), creating the potential for higher energy bills and supply disruptions.\n\nWithout the IEM, the trade of power through interconnectors, or power links, would be more difficult and more expensive.\n\nInterconnectors with Europe should continue to flow in the event of Brexit. In the unlikely event flows fall to zero, there is sufficient surplus power to meet demand, National Grid said on Thursday.\n\nHowever, the market could need to attract regular liquefied natural gas supplies to the UK, it said.\n\nInterconnector operators need to prepare alternative trading arrangements and updated rules, the UK government has said.\n\nNORTHERN IRELAND\n\nNorthern Ireland shares a wholesale electricity market with Ireland, called the Single Electricity Market, which involves cross border power flows between the two countries and operates under common EU rules.\n\nThe UK government has said it will do all possible to maintain the SEM but if it cannot, Irish markets will become less efficient with potential impacts for consumers and producers on both sides of the border.\n\nMARKET LIQUIDITY\n\nIf the United Kingdom leaves the EU without a deal it would no longer be coupled to European power markets.\n\nThe intra-day and day-ahead markets are among the most liquid products of a power exchange. They represent power that is traded for use within the same day and electricity for physical delivery the following day.\n\nCurrent high liquidity means that any loss of transaction volumes would hit profit at the power exchanges.\n\nThe liquidity of the United Kingdom\u2019s short-term power markets is likely to fall by 10-20% if there is no deal, a senior executive at the EPEX SPOT power exchange told Reuters in August.\n\nMARKET REGULATION\n\nThe EU\u2019s Regulation on Energy Market Integrity and Transparency prohibits insider trading and energy market manipulation.\n\nThe government has said most of the existing regulation will be kept domestically.\n\nUnder a no-deal Brexit, a temporary UK tariff regime will be implemented. This would apply for up to 12 months. Under the temporary tariff regime, imports of electrical energy into the UK would be eligible for tariff-free access.\n\nEU\u2019s EMISSIONS TRADING SYSTEM\n\nA UK tax on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from power stations and factories would begin on Nov. 4 if the country leaves the EU without a deal, the UK government has said.\n\nThe tax, set at 16 pounds ($20) a tonne for 2019, would replace levies under the European Emissions Trading System (ETS), which Britain would automatically leave under a no-deal scenario.\n\nIf it gets a deal, the United Kingdom government said it intends to stay in the ETS until the end of the current trading phase at the end of 2020.\n\nIt is also working on a domestic emissions trading system that it hopes will link to the existing EU scheme from January 2021.\n\nEURATOM\n\nAfter leaving the EU, the United Kingdom will no longer be a part of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), the EU\u2019s framework for nuclear energy safety and development, establishing a European market for goods and services and compliance with international nuclear safeguards.\n\nThe government has said a new UK nuclear safeguards regime will come into force run by the Office for Nuclear Regulation.\n\nHowever, the status of future supplies of nuclear fuel have not yet been agreed as it would be part of a future trade agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom.\n\n(This story corrects third paragraph in the EU\u2019s EMISSIONS TRADING SYSTEM section to say the UK intends to remain in the scheme if it gets a Brexit deal until 2020, not in the scenario of no deal)", "description": "As the United Kingdom edges closer to a deadline of Oct. 31 to leave the European Union, below is an outline of the status of energy markets in that event.", "authors": ["Nina Chestney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439240514&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990Z8", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
