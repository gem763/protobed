(The cheapest prices are subject to availability).\n\nOf course three nights is quite short, but the good news is that there are deals for those considering a longer itinerary too.\n\nFor example, the firm's Ontario Winter & Wine Holiday starts from \u00a3791pp and includes trips to Toronto and Niagara Falls, as well as a deluxe Niagara winery tour.\n\nLooking for flights only? The sale also has direct return flights to Toronto from \u00a3327pp based on a London Gatwick departure.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nIf you've never been to Toronto then you may want to check out our guide to the best things to see and do while you're there, but there are plenty of exciting additions during the months.\n\nFor example, if you're looking to use up the last of your annual leave, it's worth trying to book a trip between the 14th November and 22nd December to coincide with the Toronto Christmas Market which you'll find in the Toronto Distillery District.\n\nPlanning to kick off 2020 in style? The Toronto Symphony Orchestra will be offering up heaps of performances from the 8th-30th January, while the Toronto Sketch Comedy Festival from the 4th-15th March can be a fun way of exploring the city's arts scene.\n\nLooking for more inspiration?\n\nThinking of going flights only and going for a wider Canadian getaway? We asked Air Transat's cabin crew to share their insider tips on their favourite Canadian cities, from the best places to eat to the sights you absolutely won't want to miss.\n\nWe've also got plenty of Canadian destination guides to the likes of Ottawa , Alberta , Halifax and British Columbia .", "description": "Canadian Affair has a deal on Toronto city breaks from \u00a3439pp for winter as well as cheap flight deals", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13028719.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Skyline-of-Toronto.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
