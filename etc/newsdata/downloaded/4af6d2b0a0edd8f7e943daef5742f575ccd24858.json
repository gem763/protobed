(Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters)\n\nDecades ago, one prominent activist identified porn as decadent and exploitative. That insight is now in short supply.\n\nSince the sexual revolution of the 1960s, the feminist movement has sought to condemn traditional sexual ethics as repressive, misogynistic, and intolerant. As the 2010s come to a close, it might be fair to say that mainstream culture has reached the logical endpoint of this philosophy. Whereas older Americans perhaps still remember a time when our society promoted mutual self-sacrifice over hedonism, we live in an age when even children have access to limitless online pornography.\n\nThere\u2019s an irony here. The behaviors featured and sometimes encouraged by porn are the same behaviors third-wave feminists love to hate. While activists on the left accuse college campuses of turning a blind eye on \u201crape culture,\u201d one study suggests that men who view pornography are significantly less likely to intervene as a bystander in situations leading to sexual assault and report increased behavioral intent to rape.\n\nConservatives have long argued that treating consent as the only boundary in sexual matters overlooks matters of character, but modern-day feminism has ignored this conversation. That wasn\u2019t always the case. The late radical feminist Andrea Dworkin was the last major intellectual of a left-wing bent to engage the public on the immorality of porn consumption and its nexus with sexual violence. Pleading with Americans to stop turning a blind eye, Dworkin said in a 1993 speech:\n\nToday there is a community of people who have articulated the experience of what it means to be a woman, what it means to be turned into pornography, what it means to be bought and sold . . . call it what you want, call it speech . . . [but] it happens in real life, women\u2019s lives are made two-dimensional and dead . . . this is the crime of dehumanization; we\u2019re not talking about violence yet, we\u2019re nowhere near violence; this is what it means to be dehumanized.\n\nNow many feminists have a selective memory when it comes to Dworkin\u2019s work. Johanna Fateman, who recently co-authored an anthology of Dworkin\u2019s work, told the New York Times that \u201cDworkin lost the sex wars so decisively that we can now see beyond her most extreme rhetoric. . . . You don\u2019t have to be afraid that Andrea Dworkin is going to take your pornography away.\u201d\n\nInstead, the \u201csex positivity\u201d movement has won. Since at least 2013, colleges across the U.S. have hosted hundreds of \u201csex-week\u201d seminars. While individual feminists\u2019 views on pornography may vary, a 2015 study of data from the U.S. General Social Survey from 1975 to 2010 showed that both men and women with pro-feminist attitudes are more likely to watch porn.\n\nSuffice it to say that Dworkin would be horrified by this development. She was especially scathing of \u201cprogressive men who linked sexual libertinism with women\u2019s emancipation, seeing them as no better than conquistadors in hipster attire,\u201d Jennifer Szalai wrote in a New York Times retrospective of her work. \u201cFor all their critiques of capitalism, these men seemed remarkably untroubled when the commodity was women,\u201d Szalai added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFar from boycotting the industry, however, the more progressive corners of the feminist movement encourage watching pornography. \u201cViewership is notably growing among women, some of whom are giving porn a second look through a sex-positive lens,\u201d Lucia Graves wrote in the Guardian. (To be sure, some lonely feminists are still challenging the porn industry.)\n\nAcademics such as Madita Oeming, a self-proclaimed \u201cpublic porn scholar\u201d and \u201csex-work-inclusive feminist,\u201d go so far as to claim that the notion of porn addiction is a fallacy invented by \u201cthe media, church and self-help industry.\u201d As Oeming wrote in Vice, \u201cTo pathologize certain sexual identities or practices is almost a tradition for us. Porn addiction continues this tradition.\u201d\n\nBut the numbers paint a more sobering picture. A 2014 study showed 79 percent of men in the U.S. ages 18 to 30 reported viewing pornography at least monthly. By age 14, 94 percent of kids will have seen pornography. What\u2019s more alarming is that, according to Peter Kleponis, a clinical therapist treating porn addiction in Pennsylvania, \u201cBy the age of 15, 80 percent of teenagers will have had multiple exposures to violent pornography.\u201d The younger a man was \u201cwhen he first viewed pornography,\u201d the American Psychological Association has noted, \u201cthe more likely he was to want power over women.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet perhaps some progressives are beginning to rethink their no-judgment attitude toward the porn industry. New York Times columnist and staunch liberal Michelle Goldberg wrote recently about renewed interest in Andrea Dworkin\u2019s work \u2014 \u201ca sign,\u201d she said, \u201cthat for many women, our libidinous culture feels neither pleasurable nor liberating.\u201d The next step is investigating the roots of our pornified culture, which enslaves men and women to their basest appetites.", "description": "Decades ago, one prominent activist identified porn as decadent and exploitative.
