But the imminent arrival of Typhoon Faxai has forced Michael Cheika\u2019s side to delay those plans, with the Japanese Metereological Society warning the storm could affect several more sides due to travel on Sunday, including England.\n\nAlex Lamers (@AlexJLamers) Typhoon #Faxai headed for a landfall in Japan soon.

Organisers have planned for the possibility of having to relocate teams from their bases or even to move matches to different venues but, if a pool match is cancelled, tournament rules state that both teams will be awarded two points \u2013 in effect rendering the result a 0-0 draw.", "description": "The Australian team\u2019s departure for the Rugby World Cup has been delayed after meteorologists warned a typhoon featuring 130-mile-per-hour winds is due to hit the Japanese mainland", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/208dc914b3e5eda28c54605372de0dee5510460b/0_65_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=424e395b5c813ba57c1423f964e419bc", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
