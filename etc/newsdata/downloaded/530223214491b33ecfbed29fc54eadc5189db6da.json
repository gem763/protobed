Who is this person with whom I\u2019m sharing my most vulnerable self? Generally, patients know very little about their therapists\u2019 outside lives, though sometimes therapists make intentional disclosures in the therapy room. For instance, depending on the circumstance, I might answer a question about whether I\u2019m a parent, or even offer that information unsolicited if I feel it\u2019s clinically relevant for a particular patient in a particular context.\n\nBut often patients want to know more, so they search for information online. I\u2019m guessing that your therapist\u2019s Facebook photos didn\u2019t magically appear on your screen\u2014you had to search for them. And that\u2019s important, because your desire to know more about him will become part of the larger conversation you want to have about the Grindr profile, which I\u2019ll get to in a moment.\n\nOf course, you didn\u2019t go searching for the Grindr profile\u2014that was purely accidental. Unintended encounters between therapists and patients happen out in the world, too. I\u2019ve run into patients everywhere from the checkout line at Target to bookstores and restaurants to Lakers games. What patients may not realize is that these unexpected encounters, as innocuous as they may seem, can be uncomfortable for the therapist as well. We aren\u2019t used to being seen by our patients when we\u2019re with our family or significant other\u2014or, as happened to me, while wearing a bikini at the beach and, another time, in the dressing-room area of the bra section at a department store. In these cases, I generally ask in the next session what the experience was like for the patient. Some therapists wait for the patient to bring it up, but I\u2019ve found that often not mentioning it makes it bigger, an elephant in the room, and acknowledging the encounter can feel like a relief\u2014for both of us.\n\nIn your situation, though, your therapist isn\u2019t aware of the encounter (and therefore won\u2019t bring it up), and also it\u2019s qualitatively different from the usual out-in-the-world encounter. You didn\u2019t just see your therapist buying paper towels at Target, or even wearing a Speedo at the beach. You ran into him on Grindr and got a glimpse into his sexual psyche.\n\nThat\u2019s a deeper level of disclosure and, yes, it\u2019s awkward, and would be even if he weren\u2019t your therapist. If that profile were your dentist\u2019s or your boss\u2019s, or if you were in college and it belonged to your professor, you\u2019d probably still feel uncomfortable having seen it\u2014maybe even so uncomfortable that you\u2019d avoid this person as much as possible, switching to another dentist, for example.\n\nThat may seem like bad news, but in fact it\u2019s the opposite. Since this is your therapist and not your dentist or your boss, you have the opportunity to address it in a way you probably wouldn\u2019t with other people. In fact, the best therapy often happens when things get uncomfortable, because the discomfort can surface important material that may have been buried (as I have written about before). You might open this conversation by walking into your next session, plopping down on the couch, and saying something like: \u201cSo, this very awkward thing happened and I feel like we should talk about it.\u201d", "description": "I now know intimate details about his sexual preferences, and feel like I can\u2019t interact with him normally.", "authors": ["Lori Gottlieb"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/Therapist_on_grindr_final/facebook.jpg?1569207783", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
