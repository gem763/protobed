Shortly afterwards, he was moved to the trauma ward.\n\nIn the rush to be by their son's side they opted for multi-trip insurance, designed for people who intend on travelling more than once a year.\n\nHowever the pair were told their hospital costs - $25,000 a day - would not be covered because they had not returned to Australia within 30 days, a requirement for their insurance.\n\nThe family was also informed the cost of a flight back to Australia would not be covered.\n\nMrs Nelson told Nine News the family were left devastated when they received the news.\n\n'It just, it shattered me, I was angry, I cried and I thought how on earth are we going to do this, we're going to lose everything we worked so hard for,' she said.\n\nPerth man Phil Nelson (left), 65, and his wife Morag (right) flew to Canada in July after their son Karl was involved in a serious traffic accident that left him on life-support\n\nDespite the insurer's refusal Mrs Nelson said they consider themselves lucky that her husband had survived the fall at all.\n\n'It was quite a low survival rate so we're very, very lucky to still have him, he is in there somewhere, but I don't know if we'll ever get Phil back,' she said.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to get Mr Nelson home his family have set up a GoFundMe page with the hopes it can help them cover the massive costs.\n\nSo far the page has raised $71,000 of the $100,000 target.\n\nThe family estimates the full cost of hospital bills and getting Mr Nelson home could exceed half a million dollars.", "description": "Perth man Phil Nelson, 65, and his wife Morag flew to Calgary in July after their son Karl was involved in a serious traffic accident that left him on life-support.", "authors": ["Adam Mccleery For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/23/20353254-0-image-a-7_1572392844168.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
