Isn\u2019t it just as possible, indeed maybe even likely, that Warren, like Cruz, is waiting for a day that will never come? Trump\u2019s \u201cimplosions\u201d were never reflected at the ballot box. Maybe so, it will also be with Biden.\n\nTemplates aren\u2019t perfect, however. While Cruz did well with evangelicals, Warren has failed to make inroads among African Americans. And unlike Cruz, the establishment has warmed to Warren\u2019s rise\u2014her campaign doubles as a Harvard satellite campus.\n\nBut perhaps Warren\u2019s greatest weakness as a candidate, as it was for Cruz, is that she is not the real voice of her party\u2019s discontented. A well placed source told me that in 2012 he advised Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, that the person who wins America\u2019s big elections today is the most pessimistic of the two messengers.\n\nOf the 2016 conservatives, Cruz was perhaps most polite to Trump, but in failing to ape the future president\u2019s program, he never emerged as anything more than a poor imitation of the real estate mogul. Immigration and ennui over America\u2019s international role were the orders of the day, and for a core contingent, no substitutes for Trumpian nationalism would do.", "description": "", "authors": ["Curt Mills", "Theamericanconservative.Com Articles Is-Elizabeth-Warren-The-New-Ted-Cruz"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
