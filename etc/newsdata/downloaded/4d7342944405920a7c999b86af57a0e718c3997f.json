REUTERS/Ari Jalal\n\nThe husband stayed behind, deciding it was too risky to try to escape with them. The Kurdish YPG militia, the target of Turkey\u2019s onslaught into northern Syria, controls their home city of Qamishli, and might detain him for desertion, Akram explained.\n\nHe had fought for seven years with the group, one of many armed militias embroiled in Syria\u2019s eight-year-old war, but left recently to start a new life with his wife and children.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried my husband won\u2019t make it out,\u201d Akram, 20, told Reuters in a refugee camp near the Iraqi Kurdish town of Bardarash, her one-year-old daughter Remas cradled in her arms.\n\nThe family is among tens of thousands of people in northern Syria who have fled as Turkish forces advance south.\n\nThe assault came soon after U.S. President Donald Trump announced his forces were withdrawing from the area, giving Ankara more room to pursue its enemy without the risk of clashing directly with the Americans.\n\nTurkey views the YPG as a terrorist organisation linked to Kurdish separatist insurgents at home. It also wants to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d 30 km into Syrian territory where it aims to re-settle millions of Syrian refugees displaced by the war.\n\nBut the YPG, which was crucial in helping Washington defeat Islamic State (IS), describes Trump\u2019s move as a callous act of betrayal.\n\nIn a fight to survive, it struck a deal with Russian-backed Syrian forces, and they have taken swathes of land close to where the Turks are fighting.\n\nCaught in the middle are people like Akram. Beyond their immediate survival, they must navigate fast-changing frontlines and alliances that resulted from Trump\u2019s sudden move.\n\n\u201cSyria is being destroyed all over again,\u201d she said at the camp where she and hundreds of others are being settled by authorities in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI).\n\n\u201cAll because Trump sold us out. And the world watched.\u201d\n\nEXHAUSTED AND SCARED\n\nAbout 1,000 refugees had crossed into Iraq\u2019s Kurdish north since the Turkish operation began, according to the UN Refugee Agency and International Organization for Migration, and more are expected.\n\nTens of thousands have abandoned their homes across northern Syria, a new humanitarian crisis in a part of the country where a semblance of stability had been established.\n\nAkram paid a smuggler the going rate of $500 to get to Iraq, crossing at an informal border point because Syrian Kurdish forces would not let them leave through their checkpoint.\n\nShe and about 300 others have been taken to Bardarash, around three hours\u2019 drive by dusty road from the frontier.\n\nKurdish authorities have scrambled to erect tents and fix latrines in time for the first refugees arriving on Wednesday.\n\nThe camp was originally set up in 2013 to house Iraqis fleeing Islamic State, but was decommissioned in late 2017 after the extremist Islamist movement was defeated in the battlefield.\n\nPeople arriving at the camp looked exhausted and scared. Some children with tear-stained cheeks wailed as they sat in the coaches transporting them.\n\nOne boy, smiling with relief, gave a thumbs up as a convoy of about a dozen coaches swept through the camp gates.\n\n\u201cThe bombs are still falling and a lot of people still want to come,\u201d said 25-year-old Masoud Fatah, who arrived in Iraq on Tuesday from his home in Darbasiye.\n\n\u201cThey try coming to the border but they\u2019re getting pushed back by the YPG.\u201d\n\nYPG \u201cWORRIED KURDS WILL LEAVE\u201d\n\nAkram said that YPG fighters tried to stop people leaving the Kurdish-controlled northeast, fearful of what it would do for morale.\n\nThe YPG also worry that if large numbers of mostly Sunni Arab Syrians are re-settled from Turkey, ethnic Kurds will soon be outnumbered and lose the freedoms they have fought to secure.\n\n\u201cThey (the YPG) threatened us, told us they\u2019d shoot at us, even though they\u2019re our people,\u201d she said in the back of the minibus that had brought her to the camp. \u201cThey\u2019re worried that if we all leave, there won\u2019t be any Kurds left.\u201d\n\nOfficials from the YPG were not reachable for comment on the accounts given by Akram and some others travelling with her.\n\nThose who spoke to Reuters in Bardarash shared similar stories to Akram\u2019s: as the Turks began shelling their home towns, they crammed into cars and mini-vans with what few possessions they could attach to the roof of the vehicles.\n\nThose who did not have cars walked, some to nearby villages others into dense woods to hide. When the bombardment followed them, they pushed on towards Iraq.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t even tell where the bombs were coming from anymore,\u201d said Hamida Ali. \u201cThe children couldn\u2019t sleep, we were so afraid.\u201d\n\nAkram\u2019s hopes of returning to a normal life in Syria are already fading.\n\n\u201cWho wants to leave their home?\u201d she said. \u201cSyria is my home, my land. I want to go back. I want things back the way they were. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll ever be the same again.\u201d", "description": "Joumana Akram and her three young children escaped the immediate danger, fleeing their home in northern Syria as the bombardment from Turkish forces began and eventually crossing the border into Iraq.", "authors": ["Raya Jalabi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441587026&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1T2", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
