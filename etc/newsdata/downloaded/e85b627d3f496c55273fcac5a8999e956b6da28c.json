Volker\u2019s departure came a day after the release of the whistleblower complaint involving President Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which sparked an impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe paper first tweeted the news at 6:10 p.m. Friday, setting off a race among national political reporters to confirm it and racking up thousands of retweets along the way. At 6:18 p.m., the story hit the paper\u2019s website, published alongside dispatches on the university\u2019s clubs and teams. The Associated Press, New York Times and CNN followed with their own reports about an hour later.\n\nAndrew Howard, the State Press\u2019s managing editor and the author of the Volker story, quickly picked up hundreds of new followers on Twitter and accolades from the likes of CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter and the New York Times\u2019s Maggie Haberman.\n\nDuring a Friday night phone call, Howard told Stelter how he got the scoop.\n\n\u201cWe always try to localize national issues and see how they can affect the university,\u201d Howard told Stelter in a Friday night phone call. \u201cWhen we found out that Volker worked for the university, we just started pursuing the story. That was really it...\u201d\n\nI called ASU student journalist @andrew_howard4 and asked how he landed tonight's scoop about Kurt Volker's resignation (https://t.co/1ha0mxHBHc) pic.twitter.com/2o19p2RWgy \u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) September 28, 2019\n\nHoward pointed his new followers to a website collecting donations for student media at ASU.\n\nThe work done by The State Press, he wrote on Twitter, \u201cwould not be possible without our readers.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nWho\u2019s who in the whistleblower complaint\n\nAmateur pro-Trump \u2018sleuths\u2019 scramble to unmask whistleblower: \u2018Your president has asked for your help\u2019\n\nAcross a divided nation, skepticism about impeachment\n\nA clambake, slurs and phone sex: The long, strange history of presidential calls", "description": "The paper first tweeted the news at 6:10 p.m. on Friday, setting off a race among national reporters to confirm it.", "authors": ["Brittany Shammas", "General Assignment Reporter", "September At Pm", "Brittany Shammas Is A General Assignment Reporter For The Washington Post.
