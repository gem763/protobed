He has come out in support of private prisons that allegedly allow immigrant detainees to work for as little as $1 a day, supported the Trump administration idea of sending undocumented immigrants to \u201csanctuary cities\u201d and contributed to an effort to transform the investigation into the firing of FBI Director James B.

Organizers say it was formed to keep leaders accountable, but in practice, the caucus has worked as \u201ca bloc just big enough to challenge any vote and often succeeded in pulling policy discussions further to the right than was tenable,\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Ben Terris writes.\n\nFormer Republican House speaker John A. Boehner, who was effectively pushed out of his role by members of the caucus in 2015, described them as \u201canarchists.\u201d\n\nIts roughly three dozen members include Meadows and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), both fervent supporters of the president.\n\nIn June this year, the group was hit by the exit of one of its founders, Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.). The 39-year-old stepped down from the group after tweeting that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s report documented the Trump administration and campaign engaging in \u201cimpeachable conduct\u201d \u2014 a position that even some Democrats have been reluctant to adopt.\n\n\u201cJustin Amash\u2019s conclusions are poorly informed and fatally flawed and don\u2019t represent the views of any of the Freedom Caucus members that I\u2019m aware of,\u201d Meadows said at the time.\n\nIn July, Amash announced that he was leaving the GOP to become an independent.", "description": "He will take over from current chairman Rep.
