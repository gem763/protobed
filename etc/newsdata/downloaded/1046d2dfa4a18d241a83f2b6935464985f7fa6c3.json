Scores for students in both grades are higher than they were in the first assessment in 1992, but not higher than a decade ago.

The top-performing 10 percent of 4th graders were the only group to hold steady in reading; all other students performed worse, and the lowest-performing 10 percent of students declined the most. In grade 8, students of every performance decile performed worse in 2019 than 2017.\n\nAccording to the results, the only state that showed improvement in reading in fourth grade was Mississippi, while the District of Columbia exhibited the only improvement in eighth grade reading performance.\n\nMost states showed no change in math. Students in grade four, on average, scored 241 on a 500-point scale this year, only one point higher than the average score of 240 for 2017. Those in grade eight scored 282, compared to 283 in 2017.\n\nNEW: The NAEP 2019 #math results are in. Students' average math scores are up in 4th grade and down in 8th grade compared to 2017.

In fact, fourth grade reading declined in 17 states and eighth grade reading declined in 31. The gap between the highest and lowest performing students is widening, despite $1 trillion in Federal spending over 40 years designated specifically to help close it.\n\nNCES especially notes the \u201cgrowing disparities between the highest and lowest achievers\u201d in the decade between 2009 and 2019.\n\nNEW: Over the last 10 years, higher performing students\u2019 scores have increased and lower-performing students\u2019 scores have decreased in math and reading.

The NAEP results released Wednesday show the achievement gap has worsened.\n\nPublic schools in the country have now embraced the next progressive reform \u2013 social and emotional learning \u2013 which is purported to ensure equity and inclusiveness in schools.\n\n\u201cThis must be America\u2019s wake-up call,\u201d DeVos said. \u201cWe cannot abide these poor results any longer. We can neither excuse them away nor simply throw more money at the problem.\u201d", "description": "Results of the Nation\u2019s Report Card shows U.S. school children have made \u201cno progress\u201d in reading or mathematics over the past ten years.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/school-classroom-learning-education-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
