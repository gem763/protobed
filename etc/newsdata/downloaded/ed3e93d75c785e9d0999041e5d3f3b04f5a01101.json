Chief Executive Brian Goldner elaborated on the earnings call, saying it was \u201ca very choppy environment, where retailer order patterns have changed in response to potential tariffs.\u201d\n\nThe result is also dragging down competitor Mattel Inc. MAT, -7.26% , with that stock down 9.4% in Tuesday trading. Mattel is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on Oct. 29.\n\nRead: China casts long shadow over stocks as earnings season opens this week\n\n\u201cIn the third quarter, the threat of and implementation of tariffs in certain instances impacted our shipments and our ability to fully meet demand,\u201d Goldner said, according to a FactSet transcript. \u201cImportantly, during Q3 alone, we saw multiple different dates for the enactment of List 4 tariffs come and be delayed, now scheduled for Dec. 15. And yet, the prospect had our retailers cancel major direct import program orders and rewrite many of those orders as domestic shipments.\u201d\n\nAs a result, orders shifted in timing. Some weren\u2019t rearranged within the quarter.\n\nHasbro was also under pressure to meet deadlines imposed by important launches, like Star Wars Triple Force Friday, \u201cFrozen II\u201d and Nerf Ultra. Hasbro names include Monopoly, My Little Pony and Power Rangers.\n\n\u201cTo meet demand, we added air freight and shifted warehousing at an incremental expense to ensure shelves were stocked as the promotion builds for these initiatives,\u201d Goldner said.\n\nSee: How to buy toys for the kid who has everything -- without relying on sponsored list from Amazon or Walmart\n\nGoldner sounded an optimistic note, saying that the goal of sourcing 50% for the U.S. out of China by year-end 2020 is on track, there are new product lines coming, and there\u2019s \u201cstrong consumer demand\u201d for the merchandise to support the aforementioned launches.\n\nHowever, he still had a word of caution about the coming Dec. 15 tariffs.\n\n\u201c[T]he planned Dec. 15 tariffs will curtail direct import shipments by retailers, as they want product arriving on or after the 15 to be imported by Hasbro, and demand fulfilled in the U.S.,\u201d Goldner said. \u201cThe team is working on programs to help mitigate this impact, as well as the impact on our consumers this holiday season, but we anticipate continued potential disruption in the fourth quarter.\u201d\n\nStifel analysts didn\u2019t expect the tariff pain to be so great.\n\n\u201cWhile aware of the potential for some impact from tariffs, if this alone was the cause of the shortfall, we severely underestimated the magnitude of the detriment,\u201d analysts said.\n\nStifel rates Hasbro stock hold with a $111 price target.\n\nUBS analysts say the results also impact the acquisition of Entertainment One, a $4 billion deal announced in August that is expected to close during the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cGiven softer results, the eOne acquisition is more dilutive than when the deal was announced,\u201d UBS said. \u201cFundamentally, underlying revenue for the quarter is a key question given the industry dynamic of sales pull-forward to navigate tariffs.\u201d\n\nUBS rate Hasbro stock neutral with a $117 price target.\n\nHasbro stock has rallied 25% for the year to date, outpacing the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.21% , which is up 20.2% for the period.", "description": "Hasbro said the turbulence from the trade war between the U.S. and China disrupted the quarter, and will have an impact on the next quarter.", "authors": ["Tonya Garcia"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT779_monopo_ZG_20191022104642.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
