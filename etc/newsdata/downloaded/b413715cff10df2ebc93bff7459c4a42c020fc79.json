It appears that if you commit a crime you are better supported.\n\n'The impact this has had on my mental health has been pretty horrific. My feelings have never been taken into consideration.'\n\nKatrice disappeared while on a shopping trip to the NAAFI to buy food for her birthday party.\n\nHer family have been critical of a string of failings by the Royal Military Police, who did not notify local hospitals of an eye condition the toddler had and only treated the case as a missing person inquiry.\n\nAppearing at Wirral Magistrates' Court, Heidi Robinson this week admitted sending the friend request (pictured) and claiming she was Katrice in November last year\n\nIn 2012, the Ministry of Defence apologised for its 'flawed investigations' and a review team was appointed to reassess the case.\n\nSpeaking after her court case was adjourned, Robinson, of Moreton, Merseyside, apologised to Katrice's family for the pain she had caused them.\n\nShe said: 'I actually believed completely that I was Katrice. I'd had mental health issues leading up to the situation.\n\n'I was then at the time experiencing what I now know to be psychosis.\n\n'I really didn't intend to hurt the family but as I know my actions have done that, I am deeply sorry and that is why I have pleaded guilty.\n\n'I am now getting help and I apologise sincerely to the Lee family and my family.'\n\nLast month, military police arrested and released without charge an ex-serviceman in connection with her disappearance and began searching a house in Swindon.", "description": "Natasha Walker was stunned to receive a friend request on Facebook from an account claiming to be her missing sister, when it was in fact Heidi Robinson (pictured at Wirral Magistrates' Court).", "authors": ["Alexander Robertson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/12/19584764-0-image-a-33_1570792728266.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
