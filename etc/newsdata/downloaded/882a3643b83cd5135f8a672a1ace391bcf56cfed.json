There\u2019s so much pressure on kids these days that, if they miss one chance, you see them get scared to have another go.\n\nWhen I\u2019m coaching, I talk to them about the time I spent working with the likes of Michael Owen at Liverpool. If Michael had 10 chances, I ask them, how many goals do you think he\u2019d score? They always say: \u201cNine or 10.\u201d That\u2019s completely wrong. He\u2019d be lucky to score five out of 10 \u2013 and that\u2019s a top international striker.\n\nI\u2019ll tell them that missing one chance means they\u2019ve already done something well, because they\u2019re in the right position. \u201cMaybe another time, you\u2019ll score.\u201d Not being scared to miss becomes a mental strength. Without it, you\u2019re not going to survive.\n\nIt\u2019s funny that I\u2019m the one teaching kids all these things now, because I used to hate coaches, really. I knew what I could do. Why did I need someone else to tell me? But, looking back, I can see that the coaches and managers I played for did have an impact on me \u2013 starting with Cliff Sear, who was my coach at Chester.\n\nI was so shy as a kid, but he gave me the confidence I needed. I remember him sending me off to train with the first team when I was 15. I stood on the pitch surrounded by full-grown men thinking: what am I doing here? But when I went back to playing with 15-year-olds, I felt 10-foot tall. It felt so easy.\n\nDiego Simeone: 'If I want something I go after it ad nauseam' Read more\n\nThree years later, I was sitting in a meeting with Chester manager Alan Oakes, my dad and Liverpool manager Bob Paisley. They agreed a fee of \u00a3300,000 for me to move to Liverpool. It was a record for a teenager, but I don\u2019t remember feeling the pressure of that. Bob just told me to concentrate on football and leave everything else to the coaching team. He was a very humble man. Whether you were the tea lady, the cleaner, Kenny Dalglish or the new lad, Bob treated you exactly the same.\n\nI quickly learned that the Boot Room was the most important thing about Liverpool. Bob Paisley was the manager, but apart from matchdays you didn\u2019t see him all that much. Ronnie Moran was the mouthpiece \u2013 he never stopped talking. There was Joe Fagan, who hardly said anything \u2013 but, when he did, everyone listened. And you had Roy Evans, whose job was to help all the younger ones progress into the first team. They all had different jobs, but shared the same aim.\n\nWhen a Liverpool manager left, the club would always appoint from within. So, when Bob retired, Joe Fagan took over. Joe probably didn\u2019t even want the job. He was a simple man \u2013 he mostly just wanted to get on with his life. He knew so much about football, though. People called him \u201cthe psychologist\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Liverpool manager Bob Paisley hands over the reins to his successor Joe Fagan in May 1983.

They might have lost 3-0 and Joe would say: \u201cI can\u2019t believe we beat you 3-0, there. You\u2019ve got a great team.\u201d He built them up so much, they\u2019d leave with their chest all puffed out and feeling great. Then, if we got beat, he\u2019d be in there telling the opposition manager how lucky they were: \u201cWe had an off day,\u201d and all that. It was all mind games, really. He led us to the treble in his first season, but after the disaster in Heysel the following year he retired. Maybe it was all a bit too much.\n\nA year after Joe retired, I moved to Juventus, where I had to get used to a different kind of manager. A different kind of everything, really. The Juventus way of playing wasn\u2019t what I was used to at Liverpool and I wasn\u2019t enjoying it. I didn\u2019t feel I could produce my best football playing that way. In the end, I had it out with the manager, Rino Marchesi, telling him what my strengths were on the pitch and the way I needed to play.\n\nHis response? \u201cIt\u2019s easier for one person to adapt rather than 10.\u201d I still scored 14 goals that season, but I wasn\u2019t happy with the way we played. And if you\u2019re not happy off the pitch, you won\u2019t produce your best on it. A lot of coaching is about individuals \u2013 knowing how to treat every player. The players are there because they\u2019re good, so it\u2019s about getting the best out of them.\n\nXabi Alonso: 'When I finished playing, I could not leave football behind' Read more\n\nOutside of football, things weren\u2019t much easier. I remember trying to open a bank account one day after training. I didn\u2019t speak great Italian and they didn\u2019t speak English. These days, players have help with all that stuff, but at Juventus I had to do everything myself.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that going abroad was good for me, though. It made me a better player. I went to Juventus as a boy and came back a man. But nothing could have prepared me for what happened at Hillsborough the year after I went back to Liverpool. We could see what was happening that day. It\u2019s something none of us will ever forget. We all love the game, but football becomes second to anything then, you know?\n\nWhat I came to realise, though, was that the game could still be a way for us to help the supporters. People say that scoring in front of the Kop is an unbelievable experience and that\u2019s true. But after Hillsborough it was really something else to see their faces \u2013 the smiles \u2013 when you scored a goal. To see them happy and feel like you\u2019ve given them something back \u2013 that\u2019s what helped me to carry on.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ian Rush scores for Liverpool in their 7-0 win over Rochdale at Anfield in January 1996. Photograph: David Kendall/PA\n\nI love football \u2013 it\u2019s my life \u2013 so when I reached the point where my legs were telling me I couldn\u2019t play any more, I knew I had to find a way to stay involved. I was playing for Wrexham and not really enjoying it when their reserve team manager, Joey Jones, took me along to a training session. I\u2019m standing there, telling players \u201cdo this, do that\u201d and Joe says: \u201cSlow down. These people can\u2019t do that. You have to teach them how to do it.\u201d I\u2019d always done those things automatically. I thought everyone could.\n\nPeople seemed surprised when I went into coaching. I remember being on my first course in Aberystwyth. We were staying in student digs and, when I walked in, the other coaches looked at me and asked: \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I replied: \u201cSame as you. I\u2019m here to learn.\u201d\n\nWhen Ian Rush and Tony Woodcock scored five goals on the same day Read more\n\nYou realise you\u2019re starting all over again \u2013 that you have to go all the way down before you can come all the way back up. And it\u2019s only as you\u2019re coming back up that you get more confident in what you\u2019re doing. I did that as a player and needed to do the same as a coach. People start at different places. It\u2019s about getting your foot on the ladder and experiencing it so that you know if it\u2019s really for you. Or not.\n\nI was coaching at Liverpool and managing Wales\u2019 Under-17s when I was offered my first managerial role at Chester City, where I\u2019d started as a player. They were bottom of League Two, so it was my job to keep them in the league. I\u2019d watched them play a few times before, so knew they tried to play good football. But they had to learn how to defend.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ian Rush in his role as Chester City manager in 2004. Photograph: Dave Thompson/PA Images\n\nAfter losing my first game, we went on a two-month unbeaten run. The next thing I know, the chairman comes in and says: \u201cWe want to make the playoffs.\u201d The club had just sold my two best players and now he wanted us in the playoffs? I left after eight months. The final straw came when the chairman sacked my assistant. It was a case of: if he goes, I go.\n\nIt taught me how important it is to have a good relationship with your chairman. The whole experience put me off. I was offered other jobs after that, but I wanted to go down a different road. When you\u2019re a manager, it\u2019s 24/7 \u2013 no matter where you\u2019re working. You might be paid more for managing Liverpool than Chester City, but otherwise it\u2019s the same. You still have 24 hours a day when someone can be ringing you.\n\nSo I knew that management wasn\u2019t for me, but I still wanted to give something back to football. And I knew what I was good at: working with a group of strikers, where I can pass on my knowledge and get the best out of them. In my role at the FAW Trust I can use my experiences to help kids learn and build confidence, so they\u2019re willing to try things and aren\u2019t afraid to think for themselves.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ian Rush coaching in Boston in 2014.

During a game it was up to us, the players, to do it ourselves. If things weren\u2019t working after 20 minutes or so, Kenny Dalglish would change it, or Graeme Souness would change it. If you wait until half time to change things, it can be too late.\n\nWhen I coach finishing, it\u2019s about giving them options. Do you go with the side foot? Do you chip the keeper? It\u2019s up to them to choose the right option at the right time \u2013 and not be scared to miss. That\u2019s the secret.\n\n\u2022 This article was published first by The Coaches\u2019 Voice\n\n\u2022 Follow them on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube", "description": "Liverpool\u2019s all-time top scorer talks about his coaches, his short managerial career and his love of training youngsters", "authors": ["Ian Rush"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94db86a4cd1f5465d748aff52e9334f6264ba9a5/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f47b233c969fa6cbb2c6c0d4d21627b5", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
