The hackers, members of a long-running Iranian hacker collective known as the \u201cIranian Dark Coders Team,\u201d have become known for defacing websites with pro-Iranian and Hezbollah propaganda, hacking gas-station pump terminals online, and attacking an Israeli credit-card company over the past seven years.\n\nThe Department of Justice declined to comment publicly on the investigation.\n\nThe FBI began investigating the campaign when unnamed satellite trackers tipped off the Bureau that someone was sending out malware-laden spear-phishing emails in an attempt to trick recipients into downloading software hosted on a website made to look like a legitimate app for finding satellite orbits. The messages, written in stilted English, advertised an \u201cultimate software for tracking satellite [sic]\u201d and were allegedly sent to members of a satellite-tracking website after the site had been hacked.\n\nAgents pulled the registration information for the bait website and found that the hackers had tried to impersonate an employee of the commercial satellite imagery firm DigitalGlobe when creating the site in order to make the software downloads appear genuine.\n\nOne recipient of the poisoned emails noticed that code embedded in the fake satellite technology company\u2019s website contained noteworthy strings of text. A download link for the malicious software contained a script that included the phrases \u201cIraNiaN DarK CoderS TeaM\u201d and \u201cIsrael Fucked by M.R.S.CO And Ali.Pci.\u201d\n\nThat text, law enforcement officials believed, pointed to a well-known hacker collective, the Iranian Dark Coders Team, and one of its top members, who goes by the nickname MRSCO. The group hacked gas pump software exposed to the internet in 2015 and in 2012 defaced Israeli sites with the slogan \u201cRemember Emad,\u201d a reference to the Hezbollah terrorist operative Imad Mughniyeh, who was killed in a joint U.S.-Israeli operation in 2008.\n\nIranian hacking groups have been involved in a number of sophisticated attacks over the years, including break-ins at Saudi oil facilities and a nuclear power plant in New York state. But the Dark Coders team has tended to focus more on cybervandalism and less advanced hacks than other groups operating from the Islamic Republic. For example, federal agents found that MRSCO claimed 37 hacks on Zone-H, a site that tracks self-reported website defacements, and that \u201cat least 13 of these hacks involved U.S. facilities\u201d\n\nIn addition to MRSCO, law enforcement believes that another member of the Dark Coders Team was also involved in a similar attempt to hack people in the U.S. satellite industry. FBI agents wrote that the Iranian hackers compromised the email account of an unnamed geology professor and used it to send spear-phishing email to a \u201cU.S. person employed at a satellite imagery company.\u201d\n\nWhen FBI agents spoke to the professor, they learned that he was unaware that his account had been compromised and said he had not used it for years. Messages sent by the Iranian hackers from his old email account asked the recipient to download and test a parallel image-processing application hosted on a Dropbox accounts. Investigators looking into the attacks believe that Dropbox accounts registered to email addresses associated with MRSCO and another Iranian Dark Coder Team Member, \u201cN3O,\u201d are associated with the hacking campaign of the impersonated geologist.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly why the Dark Coders Team targeted Americans in the satellite industry or what kind of data they sought. The Iranian government has invested heavily in building up its hacking capabilities and taken on targets in the U.S. and the Middle East. Former Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats testified in 2018 that Iranian hackers ranked alongside hacking groups from China, Russia, and North Korea as among the greatest cyberthreats to the U.S.\n\nBut just because the Dark Coders Team is Iranian doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they were pursuing satellite industry targets at the explicit direction of the Iranian government.\n\nOne cybersecurity researcher who tracks Iranian hackers and asked not to be identified for security reasons told The Daily Beast that \u201cIran\u2019s hacking community is a mixture of ideologues, criminals, and opportunists\u2014all with differing relationships with the regime. As a pariah state with little access to foreign technologies, there are rich opportunities for those in Iran with a bit of technical skill who want to make a fast dollar engaging in fraud and industrial espionage, and the government is a willing buyer.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of precedent, the researcher suggests, to suggest that the Dark Coders Team is made up of \u201cfreelancers with a bit of ambition and an ambition to sell stolen information to the government.\u201d", "description": "Law enforcement found hackers from a well-known group of cybervandals trying to trick satellite trackers into installing malware.", "authors": ["Adam Rawnsley", "Seamus Hughes"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571710536/191021-rawnsley-iran-tease_tebgle", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
