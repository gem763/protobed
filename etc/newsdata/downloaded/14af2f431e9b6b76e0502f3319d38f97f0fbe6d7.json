I'd never met him, heard of him before, but when I saw him come into my company...\n\n'I have never seen a human so big walk in as I did Dibsy that day. It was a difficult situation. Dibsy had a heart condition, he was 40st. I invited him down to see me with his mum.\n\nInspirational: The host, 54, was inspired by guest Darren 'Dibsy' McClintock's 20 stone weight loss after his PT Mike Hind handed out leaflets to local takeaways begging them not to serve his client\n\nJoke: Talking to the duo about their inspirational milestone, Piers joked: 'You couldn't do a bit of work with me, could you?

Do not serve this man.'\n\nTalking about the shock method, PT Mike said: 'You [Dibsy] needed reality, he was life or death, he needed this.'\n\nSuccess: Over the last year, Dibsy has lost a whopping 20 stone and even found love with his new girlfriend Jade, while the 27-year-old is planning to have four stone of excess skin removed and go down to 15-16 stone\n\nWhile Dibsy added: 'We discussed it [the posters] all the way through, it is a harsh reality, but I needed to know that, I wouldn't call that fat-shaming, I describe it as being supportive.'\n\nHe continued: 'My ma is proud, my biggest achievement this year is that my mum doesn't have to worry about us. The amount I put my mum through, I just think I was selfish.'\n\nOver the last year, Dibsy has lost a whopping 20 stone and even found love with his new girlfriend Jade, while the 27-year-old is planning to have four stone of excess skin removed and go down to 15-16 stone.\n\nGood Morning Britain continues on weekdays at 6am on ITV.", "description": "Talking to the duo about their inspirational milestone, Piers joked: 'You couldn't do a bit of work with me, could you?", "authors": ["Olivia Wheeler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/14/19443396-0-image-a-23_1570543193957.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
