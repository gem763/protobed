Elise is used to being looked at but until she snags the older woman\u2019s gaze, her beauty has always left her feeling strangely unseen. It\u2019s 1980, early winter, and a relationship ignites \u2013 initially nurturing, then torrid, as Elise, motherless from the age of nine, allows herself to love and be loved.\n\nWriter that she is, Connie guards a private core, one that\u2019s as unreachable as the study in her elegant home is unbreachable. Furthermore, Elise\u2019s ardour is spiked with envy; she longs to have work of her own that matters, to become a woman of substance rather than a part-time waitress-cum-usher-cum-life model. When the couple relocate to the shimmering wonderland that is Los Angeles, where Connie\u2019s novel is being made into a movie, the fissures only widen.\n\nJessie Burton has been edging forward in time since her feted debut, The Miniaturist, a study of obsession and betrayal that unfolded against a backdrop of 17th-century Amsterdam. Like The Muse, which came next and paired the Spanish civil war with 60s London, this latest novel has a dual time frame, alternating between the increasingly stormy drama of Elise and Connie\u2019s love affair, and a second strand, anchored in London in 2017, where narrator Rose Simmons is on a quest to find the mother who vanished before her first birthday.\n\nOr so she thinks because, as it turns out, Rose, who\u2019s reached her mid-30s without finding her way in life, is really searching for her own true self. If that sounds a bit pat, then it\u2019s a testament to Burton\u2019s dexterity as a creator of atmosphere and character that The Confession doesn\u2019t read that way \u2013 or at least, not in the main. There\u2019s a precarious tranquillity, to the early chapters in particular, that is enrapturing.\n\nJessie Burton: \u2018Success can be as fracturing to your self as failure\u2019 Read more\n\nIt\u2019s revealed almost immediately that Rose\u2019s errant mother is Elise, and after her father finally lets on that Elise once had a relationship with Connie, Rose stumbles, with implausible luck, into a job as the now septuagenarian author\u2019s assistant. Warned by her father of Connie\u2019s ruthless charm, Rose adopts a pseudonym, stepping into her new role as Laura Brown. Soon, she\u2019s in too deep to reveal herself and yet seemingly no nearer to discovering the truth about Elise, though the reader has learned plenty.\n\nWhile the 80s are evoked more through costume than cadence \u2013 think shoulder pads and fuchsia pantsuits \u2013 the 21st century is characterised by anxiety and fatigue. Ever more distant from her boyfriend of nine years, a stalled and scantily sketched food truck chef, Rose is exhausted by the endless task of finding, \u201camongst my many shitty selves, my best self\u2019\u201d. She\u2019s not the only one. Even her friend Kelly, a mum and influencer who weaves \u201caddictive\u201d stories via Instagram, guiding the lost as she trades maternal intimacy for sponsorship deals, is shattered.\n\nUniting the two eras are the challenges that come with womanhood (this is a novel with zero memorable male characters). Both marriage and motherhood are portrayed as threats to the female self, and it\u2019s Connie \u2013 mercurial and imposing, yes, but also single and childless \u2013 who comes to dominate the story even as age weakens her. That she\u2019s capable of shocking callousness makes her all the more interesting.\n\nWhile Burton resists easy conclusions, calling out the perverse comfort that\u2019s to be had from abandonment and the myriad other ways in which a lover\u2019s hurt can justify shabby behaviour, she does have a weakness for treacly dialogue. \u201cOh, Rose,\u201d Connie exhales towards the novel\u2019s end, \u201cI always wondered if this day might come.\u201d\n\nTo Burton\u2019s credit, one can almost see Constance Holden curling her lip as the words are put into her mouth. It\u2019s one of relatively few flaws in an absorbing, intelligent piece of storytelling that succeeds in sustaining its mystery to the end.\n\n\u2022 The Confession by Jessie Burton is published by Picador (\u00a316.99).
