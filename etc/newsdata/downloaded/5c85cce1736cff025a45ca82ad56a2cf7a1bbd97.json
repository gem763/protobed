Cooperation in this area between the two regulators could alarm proponents of internet freedom.\n\nRoskomnadzor, the Russian watchdog, said it would sign the agreement with its Chinese counterpart at an international internet conference on Oct. 20. It said in a statement the agreement would have the status of an international treaty.\n\nInternet controls have tightened in Russia under President Vladimir Putin and in China under President Xi Jinping.\n\nEarlier this year, a delegation from the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), which oversees national cyber policy, met officials at Roskomnadzor.\n\nThe Kremlin said last week the two powers had a special relationship.\n\nMoscow's ties with Beijing have been marked by mutual wariness in the past and some in Russia are concerned about Chinese influence in the country's sparsely populated mineral-rich east. Russia and China share a 4,200-km (2,600-mile) border.\n\nBut Russia pivoted east towards China after its ties with the West plunged to post-Cold War lows over Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea in 2014. Trade ties with China have since expanded and cooperation has also broached more sensitive areas.\n\nLast week, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was helping China build an early warning system to detect intercontinental ballistic missile launches, something only Russia and the United States possess at the moment.
