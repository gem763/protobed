Addressing a judge and briefly turning to the rest of the room, she apologized repeatedly.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to say how sorry I was,\u201d said Richardson, who goes by Skylar. \u201cI can sometimes be selfish, but I would like to think that I\u2019ve become better in the knowledge that I\u2019ve upset everyone and hurt so many people with what I\u2019ve done. And I\u2019m forever sorry.\u201d\n\nIt was the conclusion of what Richardson\u2019s attorneys called a \u201cnightmare,\u201d a tabloid saga in which the former high school cheerleader was accused of killing her newborn two days after her May 2017 prom. The lurid details of the case \u2014 including recanted allegations that Richardson burned the baby\u2019s corpse before burying it in her family\u2019s backyard \u2014 drew national headlines and turned the young woman into a pariah in her small hometown.\n\nAlthough jurors acquitted Richardson of the most serious charges on Thursday, they convicted her of gross abuse of a corpse, a felony that carries a one-year maximum sentence. Judge Donald Oda on Friday sentenced her to seven days in jail, releasing her with credit for time served. But first, he rebuked her for showing \u201cgrotesque disregard for life\u201d in what he called a \u201cstory of two little girls: Skylar Richardson and Annabelle Richardson.\u201d\n\n\u201cI firmly believe \u2014 in fact I know, Miss Richardson, in my heart \u2014 that if you would have made different decisions in this case, Annabelle would be here today,\u201d Oda said. \u201cAnd I know that may be difficult for you to hear. Some people are inclined to think to themselves, \u2018This is America; we kill unborn babies every day.\u2019 But I don\u2019t think of it that way.\u201d\n\nIn spring 2017, Richardson\u2019s senior year at Carlisle High School drew to a close, and she prepared to start college at the University of Cincinnati. She had been pregnant for months by that time, but no one knew. The bump barely showed when she wore a cheerleading uniform on the sidelines, or a bikini on spring break, or even when she wore a snug-fitting sparkly red gown to prom. Richardson\u2019s family told Cosmopolitan that her weight often fluctuated because of eating disorders.\n\nThe teenager herself did not learn of her pregnancy until April 26, 2017, when she saw a gynecologist for the first time, Cosmo reported. Her relationship with her new boyfriend was progressing, and her mom thought it was time to consider starting birth control. But the doctor told Richardson she couldn\u2019t: She was already pregnant. The baby was from a relationship with a different boy \u2014 a relationship Richardson had ended during the summer of 2016.\n\nOver the eight-day trial, prosecutors told a tale of a teenager who killed her baby out of concern that her college plans \u2014 and her \u201cgood girl\u201d image \u2014 were at stake, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer. Defense attorneys insisted that the child was dead at birth and the frightened young mother did not know what to do besides bury her.\n\n\u201cUpon learning she was pregnant, Brooke burst into tears and told her doctor that she could not have this child and that she could not tell anyone about being pregnant,\u201d Warren County Assistant Prosecutor Julie Kraft said, according to Fox 19\u2032s video footage of the trial. \u201cAnd Brooke told no one. She did not tell her parents, her friends or the baby\u2019s father.\u201d\n\nA teen said she buried her stillborn baby in the backyard after prom. Now she\u2019s on trial for murder.\n\nThe baby came in the middle of the night on May 7, 2017, in the home Richardson shared with her parents and younger brother. As her family slept, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported, the teenager slipped alone into a bathroom \u2014 and emerged with a lifeless baby.\n\nProsecutors said they did not know how the newborn was killed. But defense attorneys said the baby girl was a lifeless pale at delivery. She wasn\u2019t breathing. The umbilical cord wasn\u2019t attached to the placenta. Recounting what her daughter eventually told her, Richardson\u2019s mother, Kim, told the Enquirer that Skylar cried as she cradled the baby for hours, waiting for the newborn to open her eyes or cry or move. The baby never did.\n\nFinally, Richardson\u2019s mother said, the teenager grabbed a garden spade from the garage and retreated to the far end of the family\u2019s expansive backyard. She dug a hole between two pine trees and covered the small grave with flowers she\u2019d worn at prom. Still she told no one.\n\nHer family found out only when police arrived months later, after Skylar Richardson\u2019s gynecologist reported the baby\u2019s death to the Warren County coroner, leaving the cause of death blank.\n\n\u201cIt is so hard to believe that I had a grandchild that I never got to hold,\u201d her mother told the Enquirer.\n\nRichardson\u2019s attorneys blasted prosecutors for \u201covercharging\u201d the young woman and said they feared she might never escape the media glare. But Warren County Prosecutor David Fornshell said that even after the verdict, he still believed Richardson killed her child. He stood by his office\u2019s handling of the case.\n\n\u201cWe owed it to that little girl,\u201d the Enquirer quoted him as saying. \u201cIt had to be tried.\u201d\n\nDuring Friday\u2019s sentencing hearing, the child\u2019s paternal grandmother, Tracy Johnson, cried as she described her son\u2019s grief and her own anguish over the loss of her first grandchild. She said she would have raised the baby herself. Last Christmas, she stayed home from family celebrations, unable to stop thinking that it would have been the first Christmas the little girl would have been old enough to love. She imagined the child opening her own presents \u2014 \u201cway more toys than any child could ever play with.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we live with our grief and loss, she can now live knowing that her selfish decision was not her only choice,\u201d Johnson said of Richardson. \u201cShe had a way out.\u201d\n\nAt the judge\u2019s order, the child will be buried at a Richardson family plot that both families can visit. For more than two years, the remains had been in sheriff\u2019s office custody. With the case now concluded, the baby will get a memorial service and a final resting place.\n\nRead more:\n\nA fortune teller scammed a woman out of $1.6 million.
