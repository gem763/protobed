Big drop approaching (new lows) as we have a 4hr rising wedge on RSI. Still could climb tad higher upon apex before dump,\u201d The Cryptomist, a popular analyst on Twitter, said in a recent tweet.\n\n$Btc Provided a target of 8670 from couple weeks ago before a potential reversal, well we went a little higher, but reversal is imminent Big drop approaching (new lows) as we have a 4hr rising wedge on RSI Still could climb tad higher upon apex before dump pic.twitter.com/8Kb6Ohkb1g \u2014 The Cryptomist (@TheCryptomist) October 11, 2019\n\nCould Miners Perpetuate BTC Volatility in the Near-Term?\n\nIt is important to note that any potential big movement, including the one that The Cryptomist is pointing to, could be perpetuated by Bitcoin\u2019s miners, as data shows that they have been holding their mined crypto and then selling it during periods of significant volatility.\n\nTokenAnalyst \u2013 another popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter \u2013 spoke about this data in a recent tweet, eluding to the possibility that another significant movement will be perpetuated by miners.\n\n\u201cFollowing up on the great analysis by @eliasimos using our miner rewards API, we tracked how much $BTC these large mining pools sent into exchanges over time. We see miners taking advantage of volatility by sitting on their mined stash and then selling around large price swings,\u201d they explained.\n\nFollowing up on the great analysis by @eliasimos using our miner rewards API, we tracked how much $BTC these large mining pools sent into exchanges over time.
