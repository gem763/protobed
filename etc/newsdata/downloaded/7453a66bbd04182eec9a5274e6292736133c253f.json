Shortages are unlikely in the short term, and anyway, there\u2019s a cellarful of homegrown booze to lean back on, should Brexit ever happen\n\nThe problem with writing a column in advance is that it\u2019s hard to gauge what will be happening two to three weeks down the line. Normally, it\u2019s more of a weather thing \u2013 hoping, if you\u2019re writing about ros\u00e9, for instance, that it won\u2019t be chucking it down on the day of publication. But Brexit ... I mean, where do I start? You don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen from one day to the next.\n\nThe (relatively) good news is that there are unlikely to be shortages in the run-up to Christmas. Retailers have stockpiled. \u201cWe always do that, anyway\u201d says Ewan Murray of the Wine Society, \u201cbut this year, we brought in our wines earlier than we would normally have done, so we have Christmas stocks and then some.\u201d\n\nMany of the drinks we enjoy will be unaffected by Brexit. It shouldn\u2019t affect wine from outside the EU any more than it already has done, given the fall in the pound. If you\u2019re a malbec lover, that should make you happy. Tesco has a rather appealing new one in its Finest range that you might want to get in for Halloween \u2013 a juicy Western Cape Malbec (13% \u00a37.50), unusually from South Africa rather than Argentina.\n\nBeyond that, the picture is rather more gloomy, with tariffs on wine projected to increase the price by 10p a bottle, while import documentation could cost the industry \u00a370m, according to Miles Beale, CEO of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association.\n\nOf course, we have a vast number of homegrown drinks, so there\u2019s no need to buy from abroad if you don\u2019t want to, though Brexit actually makes me more inclined, if anything, to support our European friends and neighbours. We have \u2013 and always have had \u2013 beer, cider, gin and whisky, to which these days you can also add a huge range of wines. However, fizz apart \u2013 and that does make up the majority of English production \u2013 our wines can\u2019t compete in price terms with their European equivalents. As I wrote a few months ago, new ones are popping up all the time. I particularly like the Oxney range, including the very pretty ros\u00e9 in today\u2019s picks.\n\nSo panic not. Well, not yet, anyway. We may be going to hell in a handcart, and UK-based producers will be affected in the longer term, but we can still drink reasonably well. However, if you like a particular wine, it makes sense to buy it now rather than later, even if you don\u2019t normally get your head round to thinking about Christmas in October. Me neither.\n\nFour home-grown bevvies to get you through Brexit (or not, as the case may be)\n\nBedlam Brewery Porter\n\n\u00a312 for six 330ml bottles, bedlambrewery.co.uk, 5%.\n\nFabulously rich, chocolatey porter from Sussex-based Bedlam brewery. Drink with a beef stew.\n\nApple County Cider Co Dabinett medium cider\n\n500ml \u00a344 for 12 500ml bottles, bottles from applecountycider.co.uk, 6.5%.\n\nCrisp, refreshing, dry Welsh cider from Monmouthshire that\u2019s drier than \u2018medium\u2019 sounds.\n\nOxney Pinot Noir Ros\u00e9 2018\n\n\u00a317.95 Vintage Roots, 12.5%.\n\n2018 was such a great year for still English wine: you should take advantage of this deliciously fruity ros\u00e9 to evoke memories of summer.\n\nHyke gin\n\n\u00a324 for 50cl, Tesco or \u00a332 for 70cl from the distiller Foxhole Spirits, 40%.\n\nAttractive new gin made from surplus table grapes. Citrussy, floral and gently spicy.\n\n\u2022 For more by Fiona Beckett, go to matchingfoodandwine.com\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
