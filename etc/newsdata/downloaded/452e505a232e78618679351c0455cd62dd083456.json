His attorneys say he deserves a new hearing because of recent Supreme Court rulings barring mandatory life sentences for juveniles.\n\nA jury convicted Lee Boyd Malvo of capital murder in 2003 for sniper attacks in the Washington D.C. area. Malvo is seeking a re-sentence from the Supreme Court since he was 17 at the time of the deadly spree\n\nThis photo provided by the Virginia Department of Corrections shows Lee Boyd Malvo, who as a teenager was one of two snipers who terrorized the Washington area. Liberal and conservative justices seemed split on whether to grant him a new sentencing hearing\n\nVirginia argues Malvo's life sentence was not mandatory because the judge theoretically had discretion to suspend part of Malvo's sentence after a jury recommended life without parole.\n\nMalvo received two life sentences for the Fairfax County murder of FBI analyst Linda Franklin, who was shot in the parking lot of a Home Depot in Falls Church.\n\nUnder the new law at the time, Malvo was convicted of capital murder as an act of terrorism.\n\nIn 2002, Malvo and John Allen Muhammad paralyzed the neighborhoods surrounding the nation's capital with the seemingly random attacks.\n\nFile photo of Lee Boyd Malvo in 2002 at a pre-trial hearing. The 17-year-old and an accomplice killed 10 people during a three-week shooting rampage\n\nJohn Allen Muhammad (center) would ultimately be executed for a murder during a 2002 shooting spree with 17-year-old Lee Boyd Malvo\n\nMuhammad was executed in 2009, for the Prince William County, Virginia, murder of Dean Harold Meyers.\n\nHowever, In June 2017, a federal appeals court threw out Malvo\u2019s four Virginia sentences, and ordered he be resentenced in light of the Supreme Court rulings regarding life sentences for juveniles. Malvo is now 34.\n\nMalvo is also serving six life-without-parole terms in Maryland.\n\nElena Kagan, a justice on the court's liberal wing, said the high court's previous rulings on the subject should be understood broadly, and that courts are bound to give serious consideration to the notion that \"youth matters\" in determining a juvenile's sentence.\n\nOn the other side, conservative Justice Samuel Alito suggested the court should simply apply the wording from its earlier case, which bans only mandatory life sentences without parole for juveniles. Because Virginia's Supreme Court has already ruled that Malvo's trial judge had discretion to lower Malvo's sentence, he would not be entitled to any relief under the court's previous ruling.\n\nThis is latest case to reach to the Supreme Court seeking specific guidelines for children convicted in brutal crimes. Beginning in 2005, the court ruled that minors can not be sentenced to death. In the years that followed, the court also removed life without parole sentences for all offenses excluding murder.", "description": "The Supreme Court heard arguments that Malvo was wrongly sentenced to life without parole in Virginia.
