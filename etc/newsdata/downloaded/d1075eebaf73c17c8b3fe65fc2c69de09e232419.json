Elizabeth Warren speaks at the 2019 California Democratic Party State Convention in San Francisco, Calif., June 1, 2019. (Gage Skidmore)\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) slammed Facebook for its handling of campaign ad policy on Thursday after CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivered a speech at Georgetown University about the dangers of censorship.\n\nWarren has previously criticized Facebook\u2019s decision to allow Trump campaign ads on its platform that accuse Joe Biden and his son Hunter of corruption, saying the ads constitute misinformation and should not have been approved for publication.\n\n\u201cTrump isn\u2019t just posting a lie on his own page for his own followers,\u201d Warren wrote on Twitter. \u201cFacebook is accepting millions of dollars from Trump to run political ads, including ones with misinformation and outright lies.\n\n\u201cFacebook is actively helping Trump spread lies and misinformation,\u201d she continued. \u201cFacebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. They might do it again\u2014and profit off of it.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg in his speech and an interview with the Washington Post on Thursday defended Facebook\u2019s policy of permitting campaign ads with misinformation and falsehoods.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people want to live in a world where you can only say things that tech companies decide are 100 percent true,\u201d Zuckerberg said, continuing, \u201cin a democracy, I think that people should be able to hear for themselves what politicians are saying.\u201d\n\nIn his Georgetown speech, Zuckerberg presented Facebook\u2019s failure to enter the Chinese market as an issue of free speech and censorship, saying Facebook\u2019s privacy encryption brings the company into conflict with Chinese censors. However, Facebook has tried to make inroads into China in the past.\n\nWarren has threatened during her campaign to break up big tech companies, a position Zuckerberg termed an \u201cexistential\u201d threat to Facebook.", "description": "Warren previously criticized Facebook's decision to allow Trump campaign ads that accuse Joe Biden of corruption, saying the ads constitute misinformation.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Mairead Mcardle", "Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
