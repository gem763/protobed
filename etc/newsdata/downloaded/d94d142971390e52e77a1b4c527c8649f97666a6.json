Biden says he offered to use his contacts to help \u201cidentify investment opportunities for Ye\u2019s company CEFC China Energy, in liquified natural gas projects in the United States.\u201d After the dinner, Ye sends a 2.8-carat diamond to Hunter\u2019s hotel room with a card thanking him for the meeting. During the divorce proceedings, Hunter Biden and his ex-wife Kathleen dispute the value of the diamond; he says it is worth $10,000, she contends it is worth $80,000.\n\nBiden denied that the diamond could be considered a bribe. \u201cWhat would they be bribing me for? My dad wasn\u2019t in office.\u201d Hunter Biden told The New Yorker he gave the diamond to his associates and doesn\u2019t know what happened to it.\n\nAlso during the divorce proceedings, Kathleen \u201crequested that Hunter\u2019s access to their joint assets be limited because the couple had a double mortgage and owed more than $300,000 in back taxes.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Nationalreview.Com Hunter-Biden-Comprehensive-Timeline"], "top_image": ""}
