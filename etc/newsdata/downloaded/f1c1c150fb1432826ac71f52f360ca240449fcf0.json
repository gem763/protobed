I do not know what will happen.\u201d\n\nKurdish residents of the area saw Turkey\u2019s Syrian military allies \u2013 the Free Syrian Army once touted as a \u201cmoderate\u201d rebel force and supported by the Obama administration \u2013 as a far more dangerous threat than the Russians, or even the invading Turkish troops. \u201cThose mercenaries are even more dangerous than ISIL,\u201d warned the Kobani resident who spoke to Rudaw, using another name for the Islamic State.\n\nDespite the sense of unease about the Russian presence among Kurdish civilians, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) military alliance reported that Russian military police and Syrian government troops have reached several key locations in northeastern Syria and are providing SDF forces with \u201call kinds of help and assistance.\u201d\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry stated that Russian military police carried out their first joint patrol with Turkish forces on Wednesday \u201cin accordance with the memorandum of the deal that was signed between Turkey and Russia in Sochi on Oct. 22.\u201d\n\nRussian media quoted the Defense Ministry saying an additional 276 military police and 33 \u201cunits of military hardware\u201d would be sent to Syria next week. Regular Russian-Turkish joint patrols of the area are expected to begin at that time.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s office on Thursday criticized the Sochi agreement between Turkey and Russia and called for an international force to patrol northeastern Syria instead of the Russians and Turks.\n\nMerkel did not provide any concrete proposals for assembling and deploying such a force, and NATO did not exactly leap at the opportunity to provide the manpower. Instead, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg spoke vaguely of finding a \u201cpolitical solution\u201d that would \u201cinvolve all actors on the ground.\u201d", "description": "Russian troops and military vehicles pour into key Syrian Kurdish cities as part of Russia\u2019s deal with Turkey to conduct joint patrols.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1177954839-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
