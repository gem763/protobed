View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) As 10 Democratic contenders take the stage this Thursday night for the next presidential debate, the most important question they'll face is one the moderators probably won't ask.\n\nEric H. Holder Jr.\n\nTheir judgment, experience, and positions on key issues are all important for primary voters to consider\u2014and of course defeating Donald Trump and ending his corrupt administration must remain a top priority. But with polls suggesting, at this early stage, that victory could potentially be within reach for virtually any candidate , when I tune in this Thursday, the most important question on my mind will be which Democrat is the most effective advocate not only for her or himself, but for the record, vision and values of the Democratic Party of today and years past.\n\nIn other words: which candidate deserves to be not just our nominee in 2020, but our leader for the next generation?\n\nThe most recent round of debates, in July, was filled with missed opportunities to answer this question.

But voters don't tune in to prime-time debates to watch hours of wonkish hair-splitting. They\u2014we\u2014are hungry for someone to present an affirmative vision for America, post-Trump.\n\nRead More", "description": "At Thursday's debate, candidates should be advocating hard for the righteous Democratic agenda--on civil rights, climate change, equality, fair voting, health care and more-- that is rooted in the party's history, writes the former US attorney general--not joining in to perpetuate GOP lies.", "authors": ["Opinion Eric H.
