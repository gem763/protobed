Ted Cruz said on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos that President Trump has \"broken the Democratic Party\" and that Democrats are solely focused on \"hating him.\"\n\nABC host George Stephanopoulos mentioned Cruz's warning that Texas could be a potential background state in the 2020 presidential election and noted that five Republican House members from the state have come forward saying they would not seek reelection next year.\n\nCruz claimed that the third Democratic presidential debate in Houston on Thursday was a \"very bad night\" for Democrats because the candidates did not mention the economy's relative strength through the third quarter of this year.\n\n\"If you look at Thursday night, the entire night of the debate, not a single Democrat talked about jobs, not a single Democrat talked about the economy, about the fact that we've got the lowest African American unemployment ever recorded, the lowest Hispanic unemployment ever recorded,\" Cruz said.\n\n\"Instead what the Democrats told the American people is they want to raise your taxes, they want to triple the price you pay for a gallon of gas at the pump, they want open borders, they want to take away your health insurance and they want to take away your guns,\" the Texas senator continued.\n\nCruz asserted the Democratic candidates' policy proposals are \"designed to resonate in the faculty lounges at an Ivy League college\" and challenged Stephanopoulos to find one working American who supports their agenda.\n\n\"I think Donald Trump has broken the Democratic party,\" Cruz said. \"They are defined now just by hating him. They ought to be the party of jobs. They used to be a party focused on jobs, they're not anymore.\"", "description": "Republican Texas Sen.
