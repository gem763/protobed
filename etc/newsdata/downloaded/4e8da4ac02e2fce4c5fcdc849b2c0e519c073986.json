Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nChronic pain patients caught in the pendulum swing on opioids\n\nTo mitigate the opioid epidemic, prescribing guidelines have changed. This has left some patients confused and struggling to function without the opioids they say they need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOnce you go down a certain path, it\u2019s not like you can just stop and turn around,\u201d health and science reporter Joel Achenbach says. \u201cMillions of people were put on these opioids to treat chronic pain, and they are dependent on them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate change fear spurs teenagers into action\n\nThe latest Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll shows that a majority of American teens believe that climate change is driven by humans, and that Earth\u2019s changing climate will personally harm them and their generation.\n\n\n\n\n\nScience reporter Sarah Kaplan says that roughly 1 in 4 teens are channeling that anxiety into activism, a notable number for a demographic too young to vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe poll is the first major look at teenager\u2019s views of climate change, Kaplan writes, since the explosion of the youth climate movement last year. Kaplan spoke with 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who inspired the movement. Thunberg is urging students worldwide to be part of a classroom walkout and demand more aggressive climate-change policy when a major U.N. summit convenes in the next several days.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nKenyan drum\n\nA massive drum that is the source of power for the Pokomo people in Kenya was taken by the British more than a century ago. The tribe elders believe that since then, the Pokomos\u2019 power has diminished. But now, the tribe wants it back.\n\n\n\n\n\nNairobi bureau chief Max Bearak explains that the drum has been sitting in a storage facility in London and that no living Pokomo have even heard the drum.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Joel Achenbach reports on chronic pain and opioids.
