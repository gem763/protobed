Is My Favorite Dairy-Free Ice Cream Brand, and Now It Has Peppermint Bark!", "language": "en", "text": "First of all, thank you, NadaMoo!, for knowing that sometimes, I may want to devour an entire pint in one sitting and for including the nutritional info in case I do so. Knowing it's 520 calories is definitely eye-opening (although that won't stop me from enjoying the whole damn thing!).\n\nFor one serving, which is one-third of the container, this Peppermint Bark dairy-free dessert has 170 calories, seven grams of fat, six grams of saturated fat, no cholesterol, 45 milligrams of sodium, 28 grams of carbs, six (!) grams of fiber, 17 grams of sugar (which includes 10 grams of added sugars), and one gram of protein.\n\nJust for comparison, Haagen-Dazs makes a Peppermint Bark ice cream and it's 280 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of saturated fat, 75 milligrams of cholesterol, 40 milligrams of sodium, 30 grams of carbs, zero grams of fiber, 26 grams of sugar, and four grams of protein per serving.\n\nThis NadaMoo! Peppermint Bark has over 100 fewer calories, slightly fewer carbs and less sugar, no cholesterol, and way more fiber. Although ice cream isn't the healthiest food you can eat, NadaMoo! is definitely healthier.", "description": "If you don't eat dairy and you're an ice-cream-lover, you have got to get your hands on a pint of NadaMoo! It's my favorite brand of vegan ice cream because it's the creamiest.
