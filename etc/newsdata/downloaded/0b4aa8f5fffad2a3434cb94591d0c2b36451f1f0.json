While GE is far from out of the woods just yet, Kaplowitz said the company\u2019s near-term goals of +/- $1 billion in free cash flow and EPS of between 55 cents and 65 cents in 2019 is achievable.\n\nKaplowitz said the company\u2019s top priority remains derisking its balance sheet and simplifying its business. Despite concerns over the ongoing U.S. trade war with China, he said investors may be underappreciating how much progress GE is making toward these goals.\n\n\u201cLonger-term, GE\u2019s runway for improving results in 2020 and beyond could be more significant than we think some investors appreciate given what appears to be an increasing focus on fundamental changes to operational and management practices that could drive better and more consistent results over time,\u201d Kaplowitz wrote in a note.\n\nOther GE Headlines\n\nKaplowitz\u2019s comments come after analysts from Deutsche Bank and Wolfe Research dismissed accusations by Bernie Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos that GE has used misleading accounting to deceive investors about its cash balance and insurance reserves. Analysts from both firms said Markopolos\u2019 report fails to make a compelling case for fraud.\n\nIn addition, Danaher Corporation (NYSE: DHR) announced on Tuesday it has priced a \u20ac6.25 billion senior notes offering to fund the acquisition of GE\u2019s BioPharma Business.\n\nGordon Haskett analyst John Inch told Benzinga on Wednesday the Danaher news should not be a bullish catalyst for GE stock.\n\n\u201cGE seems to pop on any headline \u2013 that isn\u2019t a healthy trading pattern. The deal was never in question, in my opinion \u2013 Danaher is buying BioPharma for a below-market valuation,\u201d Inch said.\n\nBenzinga\u2019s Take\n\nDismissing the fraud accusations removes one potential overhang for GE stock, and the Danaher news is certainly a positive. Management optimism is also comforting for concerned investors after so many guidance cuts and earnings misses, but at some point GE will need to demonstrate real traction toward long-term earnings and cash flow growth.\n\nDo you agree with this take?
