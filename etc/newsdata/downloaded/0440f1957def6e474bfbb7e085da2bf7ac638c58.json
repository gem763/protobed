Those gains helped offset a 9.2% decline in iPhone sales during the period.\n\nProfit fell 3% to $13.69 billion. That topped expectations but marked the first time since Chief Executive Tim Cook took over in 2011 that Apple's profit has declined in all four quarters of a fiscal year. The company's cost of sales have risen considerably since 2017 when it introduced a pricier new iPhone with facial-recognition technology and increased its spending on research and development.\n\nApple reassured investors that its new iPhone 11 models are being well received, offering guidance for the current period that largely exceeded Wall Street's projections. It expects sales between $85.5 billion and $89.5 billion for the period, an improvement on the $84.31 billion it posted in the current quarter last year.\n\nSome investors have feared new iPhone models introduced in September would fail to catch on with consumers, and weigh on sales in the coming year because they offer limited new features. The iPhone still accounts for more than half of Apple's revenue.\n\nApple said per-share earnings in the latest quarter were $3.03. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected earnings of $2.83 a share.\n\nWrite to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 16:53 ET (20:53 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
