Beto O\u2019Rourke has not met the polling threshold for the MSNBC/Washington Post debate in November.\n\nThe Democrat National Committee has required that candidates hit at least three percent support on four qualifying state or national polls, or five percent in two qualifying state polls.\n\nNBC News revealed that O\u2019Rourke had not yet reached the polling requirement to participate in the MSNBC debate, as well as former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.\n\nRecent polls show O\u2019Rourke still struggling.\n\nA Quinnipiac poll released Tuesday showed that he was at one percent nationally with a Real Clear Politics average of two percent. Other national polls, such as the Politico/Morning Consult poll and the Economist/YouGov poll show him clearing three percent.\n\nO\u2019Rourke still has time to make a splash in next week\u2019s Democrat debate hosted by CNN in Las Vegas.\n\nIn September, O\u2019Rourke earned headlines and attention for promising to take away gun owner\u2019s AR-15s and AK-47s, but it failed to move him to the top tier of the Democrat field.\n\nO\u2019Rourke also faces questions about his fundraising. While his fellow candidates have boasted big fundraising numbers for the third quarter, O\u2019Rourke has not.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t want to,\u201d he said on Saturday:", "description": "Former Rep.
