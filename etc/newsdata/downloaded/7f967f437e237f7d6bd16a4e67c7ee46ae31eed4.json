Some 2.8 million Californians may lose power.\n\n\u201cSignificant\u201d portions of Sonoma County were told to evacuate quickly before PG&E carries out a blackout that will plunge millions into darkness to prevent more wildfires from breaking out.\n\nSonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick said at a media briefing Saturday that the evacuations are the largest he\u2019s seen in the more than two decades that he\u2019s been with the sheriff\u2019s office -- more extensive than the ones triggered by the devastating 2017 fires.\n\nHe urged residents to leave immediately before the fire grows even more rapidly. \u201cWe\u2019d like to get you out while we still have power and we still have communications,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo wineries in the region owned by Coppola, a five-time Oscar winner, aren\u2019t in immediate danger, but closed their doors Thursday because of smoky air. Its Sunday Halloween carnival was also canceled, but its grapes are safe.\n\n\u201cThe winery has harvested the majority of our vineyards,\u201d said Corey Beck, Coppola\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThe grapes are in production at the winery where we currently have available back-up power if needed.\u201d\n\nFive minutes up Highway 101, Trione Vineyards & Winery will stay closed until at least Monday. That\u2019s the longest ever because of a fire, a spokeswoman said.\n\n\u201cWe had a wedding Saturday, and they\u2019ve moved to a San Francisco location,\u201d she said. They closed for the 2017 fires because staff and owners lived in affected areas.\n\nThe National Weather Service is projecting wind guts of up to 80 miles per hour in areas around the fire, and a thicker layer of smoke is likely to push into parts of the the Bay Area this evening.\n\nCalifornia is the world\u2019s fourth-largest wine producer and source of about 80% of U.S.-made wine, according to the Wine Institute. Home to 3,900 wineries and 5,900 grape growers, the state lures 24 million visitors annually to its wine regions, the most in the nation.\n\nBankrupt utility PG&E Corp. has started cutting power in what would be the state\u2019s largest -- and potentially longest -- deliberate blackout ever. California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency Friday, largely blaming PG&E.\n\n\u201cWe will hold them accountable for the business interruption and costs associated with these blackouts,\u201d he said in a news conference. \u201cWe will do the same with the other two investor-owned utilities in Southern California.\u201d\n\n(Updates with Sonoma County Sheriff comments from media briefing and other details throughout.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Hailey Waller in New York at hwaller@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Ludden at jludden@bloomberg.net, Ian Fisher, Linus Chua\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Major California wineries including one owned by Francis Ford Coppola are bracing for long closures as power remains cut amid efforts to staunch fires raging through the state\u2019s wine-producing region.Only 10% contained, the Kincade fire has swept through about 25,455 acres -- an area bigger", "authors": ["Hailey Waller"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
