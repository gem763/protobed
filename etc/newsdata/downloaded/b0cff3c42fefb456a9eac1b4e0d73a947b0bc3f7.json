The company\u2019s onetime internal credo, \u201cMove fast and break things,\u201d was about a need for rapid, sometimes reckless innovation in service of adding more users, market share and ad dollars, while its early mission statement, \u201cMake the world more open and connected,\u201d was a friendly way of expressing a desire for exponential growth. The company\u2019s new mission statement, \u201cBring the world closer together,\u201d is a friendlier way of saying the same thing \u2014 after all, you can\u2019t bring people closer together if you don\u2019t acquire them as active users first. Growth at any cost is a familiar mantra inside Facebook as well, as an internal memo surfaced last year by BuzzFeed News revealed; subsequent investigations by The Times detailed a company \u201cbent on growth.\u201d\n\nBut the costs of this growth \u2014 election interference, privacy violations \u2014 are passed on to users, not absorbed by Facebook, which takes a reputational hit but generally maintains, if not increases, market share and value. The real threat to Facebook isn\u2019t bad P.R., it\u2019s alienating its user base.\n\n[As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private? Sign up for Charlie Warzel\u2019s limited-run newsletter to explore what\u2019s at stake and what you can do about it.]\n\nThrough this lens, it makes perfect sense that Facebook should want to publicly court conservative audiences that seethe at what they perceive as Facebook\u2019s liberal bias. And while the outcomes of Facebook\u2019s decisions have serious political consequences, Mr. Zuckerberg and his fellow decision makers at the company view their decision to choose both publishers and off-the-record dining partners in terms of user acquisition strategy. According to Bloomberg, publications for Facebook News were chosen after surveying users and studying news consumption habits on the platform. Breitbart\u2019s inclusion suggests that it checked enough of Facebook\u2019s boxes, despite its toxicity. The same goes for dinner with Mr. Carlson, who launders white nationalist talking points and speaks to a large audience on cable TV every weeknight. The pattern is clear: If an entity or individual achieves a certain level of scale and influence, then the company will engage earnestly.\n\nIt\u2019s telling that Facebook would look to Mr. Carlson or Breitbart and interpret a large audience and influence as a stand-in for authority and credibility. What else should we really expect from a company that refuses to meaningfully distinguish those who share hyperpartisan vitriol from those joyfully sharing baby pictures? When scale is the prism through which you view the world, that world becomes flat. When everyone becomes a number, everyone starts to look the same.\n\nBecause Mr. Zuckerberg is one of the most powerful people in politics right now \u2014 and because the stakes feel so high \u2014 there\u2019s a desire to assign him a political label. That\u2019s understandable but largely beside the point. Mark Zuckerberg may very well have political beliefs. And his every action does have political consequences. But he is not a Republican or a Democrat in how he wields his power. Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s only real political affiliation is that he\u2019s the chief executive of Facebook. His only consistent ideology is that connectivity is a universal good. And his only consistent goal is advancing that ideology, at nearly any cost.", "description": "The Facebook C.E.O. can\u2019t be understood in terms of partisan politics.
