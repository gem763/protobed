With a 2-1 lead, they returned to that script by bringing out Corbin, their left-handed No. 3 starter, to face some lefty batters in the sixth.\n\nBut Los Angeles countered by pinch-hitting right-hander David Freese, who grabbed a single that advanced Cody Bellinger to third. Russell Martin, another righty, followed that with a deep 2-run double that gave the Dodgers the 3-2 lead.\n\nAfter a walk, pinch-hitter Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez copied Martin with a 2-run double before Corbin was pulled for Wander Suero. Suero intentionally walked Max Muncy, who had homered earlier in the night, but it only set up Justin Turner for a 3-run bomb to bring the Dodger lead to 8-2.\n\nWashington plated two runs in the bottom of the inning against relievers Joe Kelly and Julio Urias, thanks to three walks, a wild pitch, a Howie Kendrick single and an Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera sacrifice fly. But Kendrick was caught trying to take third, a baserunning mistake that made the sac fly a double play, killing the Nationals\u2019 chances for more.\n\nThe Dodgers lead the series 2-1 and can advance by winning Game 4 at Nationals Park, scheduled for 6:40 p.m. Monday, although rain is in the forecast.\n\nThe Nationals got off to the start they likely wanted when Juan Soto hit a two-run home run in the first \u2014 becoming just the eighth player in history with a postseason homer before turning 21.\n\nWashington starter An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez escaped a bases-loaded jam in the top of the first and went on to strike out six of the first 10 batters he faced. He pitched five innings and finished with nine strikeouts \u2014 five coming on a changeup that averaged an icy 74.4 mph for the night.\n\nMuncy blasted a two-strike, two-out home run off S\u00e1nchez in the fifth before his exit, the only run the 35-year-old allowed.\n\nThose five solid innings melted away after once seven runs scored on Corbin and Suero. Scoreless innings from Fernando Rodney and Tanner Rainey held Los Angeles in check, but Martin nailed a 2-run home run off Hunter Strickland in the ninth.\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 offense had nothing left to give after the sixth-inning rally was cut short.\n\nScherzer will start Game 4 for the Nationals, while the Dodgers will give the ball to Rich Hill.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
