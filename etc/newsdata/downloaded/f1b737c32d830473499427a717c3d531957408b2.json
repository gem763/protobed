USA TODAY\n\nAlec Baldwin is showing support for Felicity Huffman and expressing his belief that incarceration should not be a consequence for those guilty in the college admissions scandal.\n\nThe actor who portrays Trump on \"Saturday Night Live\" shared his thoughts on Twitter Wednesday.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think anyone involved in the college fraud cases should go to prison. That includes past cases as well,\" Baldwin, 61, wrote. \"Community service, fines, yes. But prison time, no.\n\nBefore concluding his message, Baldwin gave a shout-out to Huffman, who reported to a federal prison in California on Tuesday. She is set to serve 14 days for paying $15,000 to Rick Singer, the mastermind of a nationwide college admissions scheme, to have someone correct answers on the SAT test of her oldest daughter, Sophia.\n\n\"My heart goes out to Felicity, (her husband) Bill Macy and their family,\" Baldwin wrote.\n\nFelicity Huffman reports to prison to begin serving time in college admissions scandal\n\nRead Felicity Huffman's full, emotional statement about her 14-day prison sentence\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone involved in the college fraud cases should go to prison.

Even the current risk of jail WASN'T.\"\n\n\"Community service is better,\" Baldwin responded. \"The demonization of wealth in this country is mind blowing. A country built on both freedoms and commerce. Now, all success is scrutinized. Merely to succeed, especially financially, invites scrutiny, judgment, abuse.\"\n\nHilaria and Alec Baldwin reveal sex of baby number 5 with help from all 4 kids\n\nAlec Baldwin returns to 'SNL' as Trump stressing about impeachment; 'Kanye' ends friendship\n\nAlec Baldwin attends his Comedy Central roast on Sept. 7, 2019 in Beverly Hills.

If I had, I would have bern out on trial for assault. That didn\u2019t happen. You can apologize here.\"\n\nLast month, John Legend also spoke out against Huffman's sentence, without mentioning the actress by name. The musician is also the founder of FreeAmerica, which aims to \"transform America\u2019s criminal justice system\" per its website.\n\nCLOSE The college admissions scam involving Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman shows how some rich families use a \u201cside door\u201d to game an already unfair education system. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\n\"I get why everyone gets mad when rich person X gets a short sentence and poor person of color Y gets a long one,\" Legend's Sept. 14 tweet read. \"The answer isn't for X to get more; it's for both of them to get less (or even none!!!) We should level down not up.\"\n\n\"Americans have become desensitized to how much we lock people up,\" he shared in another post. \"Prisons and jails are not the answer to every bad thing everyone does, but we've come to use them to address nearly every societal ill.\"\n\nLegend described Huffman's sentencing as ultimately meaningless.\n\n\"And no one in our nation will benefit from the 14 days an actress will serve for cheating in college admissions,\" he wrote. \"We don't need to lock people up for any of this stuff.\"\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison\n\n'The Voice': Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani break up over this (double) steal-worthy duet\n\nJohn Legend opposes Felicity Huffman's sentence: 'We don't need to lock people up for' this\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/17/felicity-huffman-family-get-love-alec-baldwin-amid-prison-time/4006297002/", "description": "Alec Baldwin thinks incarceration shouldn't be a consequence for those guilty in the admissions scandal and gave a shout-out to Felicity Huffman.", "authors": ["Erin Jensen", "Published A.M.
