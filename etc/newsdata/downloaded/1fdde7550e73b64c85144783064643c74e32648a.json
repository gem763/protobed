Last a year a King County judge tossed out that lawsuit out, although that decision has since been appealed.\n\nOn Friday, a victory was scored for what\u2019s been an ongoing battle against gun storage laws.\n\n\u201cA Snohomish County Superior Court Judge ruled (the safe storage) law is not legal under our state preemption law, which we said all along,\u201d said the 2nd Amendment Foundation\u2019s Alan Gottlieb.\n\nThe state\u2019s preemption law bars cities and counties from enacting tougher gun laws than the state. And while that argument got guns rights activists nowhere in Seattle, it seems it was very clear to a Snohomish County judge.\n\nThat said, while the judge found Edmonds can\u2019t legally require people to lock up their guns, she did leave in place the ability to levy civil fines in situations where a child gets a hold of the gun and uses it. A gun owner can still be fined up to $1,000 if a child or thief gets unauthorized access to their firearm. If a person in that scenario uses the gun to commit a crime, additional fines could get up around $10,000.\n\nGottlieb says this ruling is a big victory for the gun rights side of what\u2019s been a heated debate in Washington.\n\nInitial numbers from Seattle\u2019s safe gun storage law are in \u2026 sort of\n\n\u201cEventually this case is going to go to the state Supreme Court, and I expect to win,\u201d he said, noting that he also expects it to be \u201ca long legal battle.\u201d\n\nAs for what it means for Seattle, the answer is \u201cnot much,\u201d at least for the time being.\n\n\u201cSuperior Court decisions aren\u2019t binding on other jurisdictions, so [there\u2019s] no immediate direct effect,\u201d said the City Attorney\u2019s Office in a written statement. \u201cThe plaintiffs in our case appealed to the Court of Appeals, and oral argument hasn\u2019t yet been scheduled. For the time being, Seattle\u2019s law remains in effect.
