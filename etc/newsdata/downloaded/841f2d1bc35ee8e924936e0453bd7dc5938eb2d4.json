And U.S. President Donald Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, among the world\u2019s only global leaders that publicly question climate science, are not due to take part, their representatives said.\n\nEnvironmental groups say the summit is coming at a crucial time, as extreme weather events and spiking temperatures affect more people in more parts of the globe.\n\n\u201cThe meeting couldn\u2019t be more important,\u201d said May Boeve, executive director of 350.org, a climate activism group. \u201cIt means countries will need to finally talk about the source of the flames engulfing our planet: fossil fuels.\u201d\n\nCOAL IN THE CROSSHAIRS\n\nGuterres has called for an end to the construction of coal plants from 2020 worldwide, as well as transitions away from subsidies for fossil fuels and a rapid shift toward renewable energy sources like solar, wind and geothermal.\n\nHe and other U.N. officials also wants China to avoid ramping up coal production in Asia and Africa through its \u201cBelt and Road\u201d infrastructure vision.\n\n\u201cI am much more concerned for countries in Africa that need to have the option not to get into coal. They need to have more opportunity for renewables,\u201d U.N. climate change envoy Luis Alfonso de Alba told Reuters in an interview.\n\nAmong the private sector speakers scheduled at the summit is the chief executive of Danish power company Orsted (ORSTED.CO), which earlier this year divested from its oil and gas assets and shuttered its coal plants.\n\nA group of big oil companies called the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, however, will host a meeting on the sidelines of the summit, focused on tempering the climate impact of fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage technology, and methane capture, according to a draft program.\n\nAlthough the Paris Agreement commits governments to a rapid transition to clean energy, the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions hit a record high last year. Under current pledges to the accord, the world will still easily overshoot an increase in global temperatures of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times, a threshold the U.N.-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in an October report would have catastrophic consequences.\n\nThe IPCC also said last month that far-reaching changes in land use would be needed to avert runaway warming and is due to issue another report on the impact of climate change on oceans next week.\n\nFormer U.S. President Barack Obama fist bumps Greta Thunberg during a meeting at his personal office in Washington, D.C., U.S., September 16, 2019.

An upsurge in activism has forced climate up the agenda in some countries, particularly in northern Europe, while disasters from floods in the U.S. Midwest to fires raging in the Amazon and Arctic have focused voters\u2019 minds.\n\nIn Europe, the new European Commission president-elect Ursula von der Leyen has said she wants to make Europe the world\u2019s first carbon neutral continent. And in the United States, Democratic candidates for next year\u2019s presidential election are championing a proposed Green New Deal to boost renewables and end fossil fuels use.\n\nInvestors are noticing, moving money to companies that can do well in a clean energy economy, said Nigel Topping, chief executive of We Mean Business, a non-profit coalition working with businesses on climate action. \u201cWe see investors becoming clear this change is going to happen.\u201d", "description": "After a summer of wildfires, heat waves and hurricanes, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says he is banking on new pledges from governments and businesses to abandon fossil fuels during a special climate summit in New York on Monday.", "authors": ["Valerie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431609209&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I0VM", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
