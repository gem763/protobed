REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke\n\nSpeaking after a meeting with leaders of multilateral financial institutions on Tuesday, Merkel declined to lay the blame for the slowing global economy solely on U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s hard-line stance on trade with China.\n\n\u201cWe have nothing to be smug about,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been negotiating an orderly British exit for three years. And that brings us great uncertainty when you consider that that exit should happen on October 31. And people still don\u2019t know how supply chains will look.\u201d\n\nOfficials across Europe are growing increasingly concerned at the lack of progress Prime Minister Boris Johnson is making on a new deal to regulate Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union after parliament three times rejected one negotiated by his predecessor, Theresa May.\n\nAn unregulated exit would bring tariff and regulatory barriers down around Britain\u2019s borders, disrupting industrial supply chains that have grown deeply entwined over the half-century of Britain\u2019s membership.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a significant source of uncertainty since Britain isn\u2019t a small European country but a large global player,\u201d Merkel added.\n\nThe World Trade Organisation\u2019s head also warned that proposals for an EU-wide carbon border tax to protect Europe\u2019s economy from being undercut by regions with lower emissions standards - an idea floated by incoming European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen - could be construed as protectionist.\n\n\u201cIt is easy to somehow introduce less legitimate, protectionist concerns on initiatives like that,\u201d Roberto Azevedo said. \u201cThey can be very complex and very costly for businesses as well. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s impossible. I\u2019m just saying let\u2019s go carefully.\u201d\n\nOther top international officials struck a gloomy note on the prospects for the global economy if the shadows cast by trade disputes continued to lengthen, with the risk of recession seemingly uppermost in some minds.\n\n\u201cUnless trade tensions are defused it\u2019s very hard to see mainstream macroeconomic tools countering the impact,\u201d said David Lipton, deputy director of the International Monetary Fund.\n\n\u201cThe other question is how much the world economy can go even further down,\u201d said Angel Gurria, head of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. \u201cI don\u2019t want to mention the \u2018R\u2019 word (but) if we continue the escalation...\u201d", "description": "Europe is not blameless in the trade tensions casting a pall over the global economy, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said, mentioning the lengthening Brexit negotiations as a source of uncertainty to stand beside the United States-China trade war.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435984678&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9038Y", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
