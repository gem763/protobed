Parnas and Fruman, positioned on the last two seats on the right, have said they will not cooperate with the impeachment inquiry\n\nParnas, pictured here with US President Donald Trump in July 2018, is at the center of the inquiry for feeding information to the president through Rudy Giuliani, his lawyer. Parnas recovered information that Ukraine had intelligence on wrongdoing by Joe and Hunter Biden. The House Committee has said that subpoenas will be issued, risking the businessmen criminal charges if they decide against testifying\n\nTrump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has coffee with Ukrainian-American businessman Lev Parnas at the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Parnas and Fruman, along with an oil magnate from Boca Raton, Florida, named Harry Sargeant III are said to have touted connections to both men while trying to install new management at the top of Ukraine's massive state gas company\n\nDemocrats have said that this refusal will lead to subpoenas, which would force them to testify, risking indictment if they refused.\n\n'While we have engaged with counsels for these witnesses, they have so far refused to agree to testify or turn over relevant documents. If they continue to fail to comply, they will be served with subpoenas in short order,' an official working on the impeachment inquiry told the Miami Herald.\n\nAn email released on Monday between the businessmen's lawyer, John Dowd, and the House Committee, said the pair's discussions with Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, would be covered under 'attorney-client,' 'attorney-work,' privileges.\n\nJohn Dowd, Trump's lawyer during the Mueller inquiry, is representing the pair. He said that the Democrat committee were 'intent' on harassment and intimidation\n\nDowd, who defended Trump during the Mueller inquiry, only began representing the businessmen last week and said that it would take a great deal of work to get up to speed with their case.\n\nHe added that the document request was 'burdensome' and that he is convinced Democrats in the impeachment inquiry, '[their] intent is to harass, intimidate and embarrass my clients.'\n\nParnas originally received the information that Ukraine had intelligence on Joe and Hunter Biden to the Trump administration.\n\nHe added that he tried to approach the Trump government through official means but that they were uninterested in receiving it that way.\n\nHe snuck the information to the president through the president's lawyer, and their friend, Rudy Giuliani.\n\n'I got certain information and I thought it was my duty to hand it over,' he told the Miami Herald on 26 September.\n\nThis news comes just a day after AP reported that the pair were involved in trying to force Ukraine's state-run gas company to give lucrative contracts to the president's supporters.\n\nThe House Committees of Foreign Affairs, Oversight, and Intelligence issued a subpoena for Rudy Giuliani (pictured left), President Trump's personal lawyer, demanding that he produce communications and records related to Ukraine in connection with the impeachment inquiry\n\nLev Parnas (far left), and Igor Fruman (far right)on 4 July, 2018. The Ukrainian born pair, had a plan to steer lucrative contracts to companies controlled by Trump allies, according to two people with knowledge of their plans\n\nJust as Giuliani was pressuring the country to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, a group of individuals with ties to POTUS and his personal lawyer were also active in the former Soviet republic.\n\nParnas and Fruman, along with an oil magnate from Boca Raton, Florida, named Harry Sargeant III are said to have touted connections to both men while trying to install new management at the top of Ukraine's massive state gas company.\n\nTheir plan was to then steer lucrative contracts to companies controlled by Trump allies, according to two people with knowledge of their plans.\n\nBut their scheme hit a snag when Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko lost his reelection bid to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whose conversation with Trump about former Vice President Joe Biden is now at the center of the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nParnas can be seen here with his wife, Svetlana Parnas, in an Instagram photo\n\nThe Democrat House Committee's impeachment inquiry is related to a call on July 25 where he allegedly called the Ukrainian president asking him to investigate presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son.\n\nThe whistleblower who blew the lid on the phone call wrote a personal memo the day after the call saying their White House source called the conversation 'crazy' and 'frightening.'\n\n'The following is a record of a conversation I had this afternoon with a White House official about the telephone call yesterday morning between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy,' the unidentified whistleblower wrote in a two-page, single-spaced memo on July 26, just a day after the now-infamous call, obtained by Fox News.\n\nThe White House official who told the whistleblower of the conversation described the call as 'crazy, frightening and completely lacking in substance related to national security.'", "description": "Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two Ukraine-born\u00a0Florida real estate entrepreneurs, have said that they will not accept the Democrat committee's ultimatum to hand in documents by Monday.", "authors": ["Ryan Fahey For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/10/19435086-0-image-a-30_1570526324303.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
