It announced the indictment of 30-year-old Henry K. Frese of Alexandria on charges that he used his position at the Defense Intelligence Agency to pass along \u201cTOP SECRET information regarding a foreign country\u2019s weapons systems to a journalist,\u201d according to a department press release on the matter.\n\n\u201cAs laid out in today\u2019s indictment, Frese was caught red-handed disclosing sensitive national security information for personal gain,\u201d Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers said in the release. \u201cFrese betrayed the trust placed in him by the American people \u2014 a betrayal that risked harming the national security of this country. This is one of six unauthorized disclosure cases the Department has charged in just over two years, and we will continue in our efforts to punish and deter this behavior.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to a search-warrant affidavit connected to the case, so-called \u201cNews Outlet 1\u201d published eight stories between early May and mid-July of 2018, which contained \u201cclassified national defense information that relates to the capabilities of certain foreign countries\u2019 weapons systems.\u201d The court documents identify two reporters \u2014 \u201cJournalist 1\u201d and \u201cJournalist 2\u201d \u2014 with whom Frese allegedly communicated over the relevant period of time.\n\nThough the names are omitted, the clues are not: \u201cIn early July 2019, Journalist 1 and Journalist 2 co-authored an article related to topics similar to Journalist 1\u2019s article containing classified NDI,\u201d reads the search warrant affidavit. \u201cOn Journalist 1\u2019s personal Twitter page, Journalist 1 Tweeted a link to the early July 2019 article, noting it was the first co-authored piece of the pair. On Journalist 2\u2019s personal Twitter page, Journalist 2 Tweeted a link to the article and stated Journalist 1 was a \u2018colleague\u2019 who helped co-author the news article.\u201d\n\nThose references appear to correspond with these tweets, from CNBC national security reporter Amanda Macias:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNBC's @ckubeNBC and I break in our first shared byline.\n\n\n\nBeijing is in the midst of conducting a series of anti-ship missile tests in the South China Sea.\n\n\n\nThese contested waters serve as a gateway to global sea routes where approximately $3.4 trillion in trade pass annually. https://t.co/G6srwEoUbl \u2014 Amanda Macias (@amanda_m_macias) July 1, 2019\n\nAnd one from her counterpart at NBC News, Courtney Kube:\n\nWith my colleague @amanda_m_macias: Chinese military conducts anti-ship missile tests in South China Sea https://t.co/n5KD4c3MUi via @nbcnews \u2014 Courtney Kube (@ckubeNBC) July 1, 2019\n\nThe court documents suggest that the central figures in the indictment missed the rising paranoia among journalists and government sources that followed the Obama administration\u2019s investigative overreach into leaks to the Associated Press and Fox News; its work in going after leakers from all corners of the government; and the Trump administration\u2019s intensification of these tactics. For a half-decade or so, Beltway journalists \u2014 and national security types, as well \u2014 have obsessed over how to communicate with sources beyond the reach of search warrants, wiretaps and the like.\n\nAD\n\nIn this case, the communications presented law-enforcement authorities with a hanging curveball. For instance, the affidavit declares that Macias followed Frese on Twitter and Frese followed Macias on Twitter. \u201cSearch warrant returns from Twitter show that, seven days after FRESE accessed Intelligence Report 1 for the second time, Journalist 1 wrote a Twitter Direct Message (\u201cDM\u201d) to FRESE in which she asked whether FRESE would be willing to speak with Journalist 2.\"\n\nAD\n\nThe Erik Wemple Blog asked CNBC about the network\u2019s source-protection methods. We haven\u2019t received a response. A spokesman for NBC News declined to comment.\n\nIt gets worse, though: The affidavit states that via \u201copen source records\u201d search, the authorities were able to determine that Frese followed Macias on Twitter and Macias followed Frese on Twitter. That makes sense, especially when considering this additional fact: \u201cPublic records checks also show that FRESE and Journalist 1 had the same residential address from August 2017 through August 2018. Based on reviews of FRESE\u2019s and Journalist 1\u2019s public social media pages, it appears that they were involved in a romantic relationship for some or all of that period of time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nInstant conflict of interest. No journalist can report objectively on the defense establishment if he or she is involved romantically with a key source employed therein. Though court documents don\u2019t explicitly cite all the stories that allegedly stemmed from Frese, there are several stories that rely on deep intelligence sourcing, including:\n\nAD\n\nCourt records make clear that law enforcement secured an order for electronic and wire monitoring of Frese\u2019s phone, though there\u2019s no indication the authorities sought to secure records from the journalists\u2019 devices. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I\u2019ve seen in there suggesting that they got records or content from reporters,\u201d says Gabe Rottman, the director of the technology and press freedom project at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.\n\nThat bit of forbearance differentiates this investigation from the aforementioned AP and Fox News cases \u2014 in which the government seized records of journalistic communications \u2014 as well as the 2018 case involving New York Times reporter Ali Watkins. In that case, the FBI grabbed records of Watkins\u2019 communications with James Wolfe, who\u2019d served as security director for the Senate Intelligence Committee. Charged with lying to law enforcement about his communications with reporters, Wolfe carried on a romantic relationship with Watkins while she covered the committee for several publications. Wolfe pleaded guilty to one count of lying to the FBI.\n\nAD\n\nAll of which is to say that leak prosecutions are a serious business in Washington. In August 2018, former intelligence contractor Reality Winner was slapped with the longest sentence ever \u2014 five years and three months in federal prison \u2014 for leaking to the media. Frese faces a maximum of 10 years in prison under each of the two counts of \u201cwillful transmission of national defense information to persons not entitled to receive it,\u201d according to the Justice Department release.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got 18 or 20 of these cases out there,\u201d says Rottman, referring to the combined Obama-Trump tally. Along with the uptick in the number of cases, there\u2019s an \u201cincrease in the severity of punishment,\u201d as well. \u201cAggressive leak prosecutions chill news-gathering because they dissuade sources from coming forward with newsworthy information,\u201d he says.\n\nRead more from Erik Wemple:\n\nAD", "description": "Prosecutions for divulging government secrets to the media are a serious business in Washington.", "authors": ["Erik Wemple", "Media Critic With A Focus On The Ups", "Downs", "Downs Of The Cable-News Industry.", "Media Critic"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/spgc1n-Pa0_SYySWqAYu4czz3P8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7Q4TOG2ZBJGFJOKQON5V2ULF3E", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
