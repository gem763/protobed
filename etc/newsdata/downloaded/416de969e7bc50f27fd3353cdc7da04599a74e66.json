But it is possible for a woman\u2019s water to break early and not be followed by labor \u2014 a condition known as preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, or preterm PROM, per the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPreterm PROM can be caused by inflammation of the fetal membranes, vaginal bleeding during the second and third trimesters, smoking during pregnancy, a short cervical length, and being underweight, among other causes. It's not clear what led to Middleton's case of preterm PROM.\n\nDoctors typically attempt to delay labor if a woman experiences preterm PROM before 34 weeks, according to the Mayo Clinic. However, \u201cthe longer it takes for labor to start after your water breaks, the greater the risk of you or your baby developing an infection,\u201d it adds.\n\nMiddleton was sent home after three days in the hospital and monitored at least twice a week for several weeks after her water broke, she said.\n\n\u201cIt was an incredibly stressful situation because I was worried about the baby's health the whole time,\u201d she recalled to SWNS.\n\nAt 35 weeks, Middleton began experiencing contractions and was rushed to St. James\u2019s University Hospital in Leeds, she said. Roughly 21 hours later \u2014 following a \u201ctraumatic and very painful\u201d labor, she said \u2014 the 24-year-old welcomed her son, Archie.\n\nNORTH DAKOTA SEES MENINGOCOCCAL MENINGITIS CASES FOR FIRST TIME SINCE 2014: STATE HEALTH OFFICIALS\n\nBut roughly an hour later, Middleton claims Archie began to have difficulty breathing and was quickly taken to the neonatal intensive care unit. He was reportedly diagnosed with pneumonia and sepsis. Thankfully, a round of antibiotics cleared Archie of infection, and, on Oct. 25, he was given the clear to go home.\n\n\u201cOne minute we were having cuddles and everything was fine and the next minute he was gone [to the NICU],\u201d the new mom told SWNS of the scary moment. \"If it wasn't for their amazing work who knows what would have happened to Archie.\"", "description": "A British mom claims she gave birth to her son 10 weeks after her water first broke.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
