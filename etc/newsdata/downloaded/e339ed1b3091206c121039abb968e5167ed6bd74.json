We estimate that, in the long run, the economy would be 3.5% smaller with the deal compared to continued EU membership.\n\n\"The economy is estimated to be 2.5% per cent smaller now than it would otherwise have been as a result of the 2016 Brexit vote.\"\n\nThe deal has already been agreed with EU leaders and can be taken up by anyone who becomes Prime Minister after the December 12 election.\n\nIf Boris Johnson wins he may decide to push it through Parliament by re-starting his Withdrawal Agreement Bill in the Commons.\n\nBut if Jeremy Corbyn wins it could expect to be torn up in favour of a deal that avoids a border in the Irish Sea, enters a customs union with the EU and ensures workers' rights are fully protected.", "description": "\"We don't expect there to be a 'deal dividend' at all\", one expert declared", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "David Milliken", "Image", "Chris J Ratcliffe", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20753094.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Parliament-Votes-In-Favour-Of-A-Pre-Christmas-General-Election.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
