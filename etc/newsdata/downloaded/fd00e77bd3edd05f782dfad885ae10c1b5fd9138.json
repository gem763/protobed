The United Nations figure measures life expectancy, education and standard of living and was created to assess the overall development of a country, not economic growth alone.\n\nScheer said today that Tuesday's announcement would not affect groups receiving aid to provide abortion and maternal health services to women and girls abroad.\n\n\"We are not reopening this debate at any level. What this is about is which types of countries will receive financial assistance. And so, groups that are receiving funding will continue to receive funding going in future,\" he said.\n\n\"This decision does not affect groups or programs going forward.\"\n\nScheer also went after Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau's record on the world stage, citing his opponent's trip to India and his \"gushing\" praise for Fidel Castro.\n\nScheer was asked whether the cuts could affect Canada's bid for a seat on the UN Security Council. \"It's more important to me that I help Canadians get ahead than curry favour at the United Nations,\" he replied. \"That is our priority. That is our focus.\"\n\nDuring his announcement, Scheer also committed to providing additional support to Ukraine and using Canada's Magnitsky law to target countries like Iran. That law allows the Canadian government to impose sanctions and travel bans on foreign officials responsible for human rights violations.\n\nAccording to Global Affairs, Canada spent more than $6 billion on international assistance during the 2017-2018 fiscal year. The top five recipients were Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Mali and Nigeria.", "description": "Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer\u00a0is promising to\u00a0cut Canadian foreign aid by 25 per cent if he's elected.
