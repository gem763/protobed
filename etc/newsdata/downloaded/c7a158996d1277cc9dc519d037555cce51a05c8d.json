The domestic price includes a 12.5% import tax and 3% sales tax.\n\n\u201cJewellers are not making purchases anticipating a bigger fall,\u201d said a Mumbai-based dealer at a private bullion-importing bank.\n\nJewellers are running business with thin inventories and have to build stocks for the festive season, the dealer said.\n\nDemand in India usually strengthens in the final quarter of the year due to the wedding season as well as festivals such as Diwali and Dussehra, when buying gold is considered auspicious.\n\nIndia\u2019s August gold imports plunged 73% from a year ago due to a price rally and a hike in import duty, a government source said on Wednesday.\n\nGlobal benchmark spot gold prices were set to mark a weekly decline, but still held above $1,500, having hit $1,557 earlier in the week, the most expensive since April 2013.\n\nIn top gold buyer China, bullion was sold at a premium of $9-$10 an ounce over the benchmark, unchanged from last week.\n\nWhile buying did pick up slightly, it\u2019s mostly coming from the investment side while jewellery demand is weak, said Samson Li, a Hong Kong-based precious metals analyst with Refinitiv GFMS.\n\nHong Kong premiums were little changed at $0.50-$1.15 from last week\u2019s $0.60-$1.10 range.\n\nThough signs of easing political tensions in Hong Kong boosted sentiment in wider markets, impacts are yet to be seen in terms of activity in the bullion market, traders said.\n\nIn Singapore, premiums were quoted in the $0.50-$0.60 an ounce range versus last week\u2019s $0.60-$0.80.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen substantially more interest in silver versus gold this week,\u201d said Vincent Tie, sales manager at Silver Bullion.\n\nGlobal spot silver prices have risen about 27% since the end of May.\n\nIn Japan, gold was sold at an about $0.75 discount, a Tokyo-based trader said.\n\nJapanese retail gold prices, meanwhile, hit their highest since 1980.", "description": "Demand for physical bullion was subdued in major Asian hubs this week as high prices dampened consumer interest, although some hefty discounts on offer in India led to a slight uptick in buying ahead of a major festival season.", "authors": ["Rajendra Jadhav", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426949514&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8519E", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
