McCarthy, a judge on Fox\u2019s \u201cThe Masked Singer,\u201d then proceeded to make the rest of the interview incredibly awkward by saying:\n\n\u201cTonight you\u2019re nominated for your own show. What\u2019s that like? First time, right?\u201d\n\nIn response to McCarthy\u2019s question, Applegate channeled the fury of her \u201cDead to Me\u201d character and responded with: \u201cUm, well, no \u2026 \u2018Samantha Who?\u2019 a couple of times. But it\u2019s OK. We don\u2019t have to talk about that.\u201d\n\nApplegate actually won an Emmy in 2003 for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her portrayal as Rachel Green\u2019s sister Amy in \u201cFriends\u201d and was nominated again in 2004. What made McCarthy\u2019s question even more cringy was that Applegate has been nominated twice before \u2014 in 2008 and 2009 \u2014 for Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for playing Samantha Newly in ABC\u2019s \u201cSamantha Who?\u201d \u2014 a show Applegate also co-executive produced.\n\nChristina Applegate looking like somebody come get me right now standing next to Jenny McCarthy #Emmys2019 pic.twitter.com/FVPyYQtTRJ \u2014 DKT (@darleneturner53) September 22, 2019\n\nMcCarthy added that she remembers watching Applegate on TV when she was young and wanted to be her when she grew up, which was particularly odd being that McCarthy, 46, is only a year younger than the 47-year-old Applegate.\n\nPeople on Twitter weren\u2019t pleased with this comment.\n\nLove HuffPost?

In an interview with \u201cE! News\u2019\u201d Giuliana Rancic, Applegate was asked if her daughter, Sadie Grace, would be watching the Emmys.\n\n\u201cHi, Sadie Grace! Are you watching right now?\u201d Applegate said to the camera. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she\u2019s watching \u2018E!... \u2019\u201d\n\nChristina Applegate didn\u2019t have to murder Giuliana Rancic like this #Emmys pic.twitter.com/bg9z6ObPEn \u2014 Ira thee Third (@ira) September 22, 2019\n\nThe joke was a dig at \u201cE!,\u201d in which Applegate implied that her daughter might have a penchant for another network.\n\nYet, whatever Sadie Grace\u2019s preferences may be, we\u2019ll take whatever brand of Applegate her mom may be serving at any given time.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nSoak Up The Last \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Group Selfie We\u2019ll Probably See For A While\n\nThe Emmy Awards Reflected TV\u2019s Future, While The Show Was Stuck In The Past\n\nLaverne Cox's Rainbow Emmys Clutch Had A Powerful, Pro-LGBTQ Message\n\nThis article originally appeared on HuffPost.", "description": "Watch a 2019 Emmy Awards red carpet Q&A that crashed and burned.", "authors": ["Elyse Wanshel"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NPQ4gQIh7E4hjHwvjfY9Ew--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d89378f2100001106ebc0e9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
