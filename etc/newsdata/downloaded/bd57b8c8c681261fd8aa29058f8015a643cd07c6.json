(Ed Zurga/AP Photo)\n\nIt\u2019s Patrick Mahomes vs. Jacoby Brissett as the Kansas City Chiefs face the Indianapolis Colts. Follow along here for live updates.\n\nIn-game updates\n\n1st Quarter\n\nKelce \u2018fumble\u2019 reversed: When the NFL tweaked the catch rule prior to last season, league leaders acknowledged there would be more plays with legal catches and fumbles. The Colts nearly had one of those with a catch and fumble by Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, recovered and returned by Indianapolis. Officials allowed the play to continue on the field with an initial ruling of a legal catch by Kelce and a fumble. However, the on-field call was reversed on the automatic replay review that follows a turnover. It looked like the proper call on replay. Kelce had possession of the football and two feet on the ground but did not take a third step or make a football move as required by the new rule for a legal catch. (Colts 7, Chiefs 3 with 1:37 left in the 1st quarter)\n\nColts run over K.C. defense: The Colts held the Chiefs to a field goal on the game\u2019s opening drive, then scored a touchdown on their first possession. Their 11-play drive included eight running plays, including a 30-yard dash by Marlon Mack. Jacoby Brissett scored on a one-yard quarterback keeper. (Colts 7, Chiefs 3 with 3:44 left in the 1st quarter)\n\nHot start for Mahomes: Patrick Mahomes completed eight of nine passes for 71 yards on the Chiefs\u2019 opening drive. But Kansas City had to settle for a 29-yard field goal by kicker Harrison Butker. That\u2019s an early victory for the Indianapolis defense, keeping the Chiefs out of the end zone.

(Ed Zurga/AP Photo)\n\nPreview\n\nThere was a time, before the season, when it appeared that this would be a marquee matchup in prime time, with quarterbacks Patrick Mahomes and Andrew Luck squaring off.\n\nBut then Luck stunned the Indianapolis Colts and the rest of the football-watching world by deciding just before the season to retire because the ceaseless string of injuries that he\u2019d endured had robbed him, he said, of his enthusiasm for the sport. Now it\u2019s Mahomes vs. Jacoby Brissett, and that doesn\u2019t move the needle nearly as much.\n\nMake no mistake: Any time you get a chance to watch Mahomes throw a football, it\u2019s worth it. He\u2019s coming off a league MVP season as a second-year pro, and he\u2019s playing even better than he did last season. Through a quarter of this season, Mahomes has thrown for 1,510 yards and has 10 touchdown passes, no interceptions and a passer rating of 120.4. It was 113.8 last year in his 5,097-yard, 50-touchdown, 12-interception MVP season.\n\nColts at Chiefs\n\nWhen: Sunday at 8:20 p.m. Eastern\n\nWhere: Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo.\n\nTV: NBC\n\nStreaming: fuboTV\n\nMahomes\u2019s Kansas City Chiefs are unbeaten even while playing without wide receiver Tyreek Hill, who remains sidelined with a shoulder injury. Left tackle Eric Fisher is out with a groin injury and wideout Sammy Watkins is listed as questionable for this game with shoulder and hamstring injuries. Does it really matter? Mahomes seems to find a way to make things work, no matter what. Running back Damien Williams could return after missing two games due to a knee injury.\n\nThe Colts are shorthanded on defense with all-pro linebacker Darius Leonard out for a third straight game because of a concussion. The Indianapolis defense also is to be without injured safeties Clayton Geathers and Malik Hooker.\n\nBrissett has played well, but the Colts are coming off an unsightly loss at home to the Oakland Raiders, the game in which tight end Jack Doyle absorbed a helmet-to-helmet hit by Raiders linebacker Vontaze Burfict that led the NFL to suspend Burfict for the remainder of the season. Two key Colts players on offense are listed as questionable, wide receiver T.Y. Hilton with a quadriceps injury and running back Marlon Mack with an ankle injury. It appears possible that both could play.\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nHow Gardner Minshew went from college nomad to mustachioed cult hero to NFL\u2019s top rookie\n\nBrewer: Russell Wilson is the best franchise quarterback in the NFL\n\nThe Rams are reeling after Thursday night loss to Seattle", "description": "Mahomes has been even more productive in the first quarter of this season than he was last year in his MVP season.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl", "October At Pm", "Mark Maske Covers The Nfl For The Washington Post.
