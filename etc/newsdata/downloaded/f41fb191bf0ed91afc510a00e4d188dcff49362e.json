But more than half the state attorneys general in the nation balked, saying they planned to continue pursuing the company and its owners, the Sackler family.\n\nUnder terms of a plan negotiated for months, the Sacklers would relinquish control of Stamford, Conn.-based Purdue Pharma and admit no wrongdoing. The company would declare bankruptcy and be resurrected as a trust whose main purpose would be producing medications to combat the opioid epidemic.\n\nIf the deal becomes final, it would be the first comprehensive settlement in the broad effort to hold drug companies accountable for their role in the opioid epidemic. To date, Purdue has also settled with one state, Oklahoma, for $270 million, and won a victory when a North Dakota judge threw out that state\u2019s case against the company.\n\nThe deal also would mark the demise of Purdue as a private company widely blamed for its role in driving the prescription opioid epidemic in the late 1990s and the first years of this century. In 2007, Purdue and three of its executives pleaded guilty to criminal charges of misleading doctors and the public about the safety of OxyContin and paid a $635 million fine.\n\nThe prescription drug epidemic has taken more than 200,000 lives via overdoses since 1999, according to federal statistics. An additional 200,000 deaths are blamed on overdoses from heroin and illegal fentanyl smuggled into the country from China and Mexico.\n\nOn Wednesday, the divide over the settlement broke down largely along party lines, with most Republican state attorneys general in favor of it and Democrats largely opposed. The states openly opposing the deal \u2014 including California, Connecticut, North Carolina, New York, New Jersey, Maryland and Pennsylvania \u2014 could take their objections to bankruptcy court and tie up the proceedings for years, some experts said.\n\n\u201cThese people are among the most responsible for the trail of death and destruction the opioid epidemic has left in its wake,\u201d said North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, who plans to sue the Sacklers personally.\n\n\u201cThis apparent settlement is a slap in the face to everyone who has had to bury a loved one due to this family\u2019s destruction and greed,\u201d said Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro. \u201cIt allows the Sackler family to walk away billionaires and admit no wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nBut Republican attorneys general, Dave Yost of Ohio and Ken Paxton of Texas, backed the agreement.\n\n\u201cThe proposed settlement with Purdue provides the greatest certainty for all Ohioans to receive relief as quickly as possible in light of rumored bankruptcy,\u201d said Yost spokeswoman Bethany McCorkle.\n\nIn addition to 23 states, four territories supported the deal. Paxton said it would \u201csecure billions in funding to address opioid addiction across the nation, and permanently remove the Sackler family from the pharmaceutical industry.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Purdue said it \u201ccontinues to work with all plaintiffs on reaching a comprehensive resolution to its opioid litigation that will deliver billions of dollars and vital opioid overdose rescue medicines to communities across the country impacted by the opioid crisis.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Mortimer D. Sackler and Raymond Sackler families issued a statement saying that \u201cthe family supports working toward a global resolution that directs resources to the patients, families and communities across the country who are suffering and need assistance. This is the most effective way to address the urgency of the current public health crisis and to fund real solutions, not endless litigation.\u201d\n\nThe deal was said to be worth $10 billion to $12 billion, including a guarantee of $3 billion payment from the Sacklers over seven years. That could be financed at least in part by the sale of the family\u2019s international drug conglomerate, Mundipharma, according to an analysis of the deal reviewed by The Washington Post. If the Sacklers earn more than $3 billion from that sale, part of it would go to the plaintiffs as well, according to a provision of the settlement.\n\nThe federal plaintiffs and many attorneys general believed the proposal was as good as they could get. The lawyers for the cities and counties agreed to recommend they \u201cmove forward in support of the current proposal, subject to satisfactory documentation of the essential terms and final documents,\u201d said Paul J. Hanly Jr., Paul T. Farrell Jr. and Joseph F. Rice, three of the leaders of that group. \u201cWe feel good progress has and will continue to be made.\u201d\n\nBut some states objected that the Sacklers were not contributing enough cash from their personal fortunes, built largely on the sale of OxyContin and taken out of the company in recent years, according to court papers filed by some states.\n\nAnother major concern is that the deal relies in significant measure on the assumed value of Purdue\u2019s assets and the sale of its global drug company. States opposing it fear that these values may be overestimated and that some of the settlement money may never materialize.\n\n\u201cThe $10 to $12 billion figures are vaporous,\u201d said Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh (D). \u201cI have not seen a deal that would yield anywhere close to those kinds of returns.\u201d\n\nStill pending is the mammoth federal case in Cleveland against other drug manufacturers, distributors and retail pharmacy chains, known as a \u201cmultidistrict litigation\u201d or MDL. In that case, the lawsuits from cities, counties, Indian tribes, hospitals and other groups have been consolidated. Judge Dan Aaron Polster has presided over that litigation, urging the parties to settle before trial so that money can be funneled quickly into drug treatment, emergency care, law enforcement and other local needs.\n\nThe federal trial is scheduled to begin in mid-October with two test cases, Cuyahoga and Summit counties, as the first plaintiffs. Meanwhile, the more than 40 lawsuits against drug companies are wending their way through state courts. Purdue would be eliminated from those cases where a settlement is finalized. A growing number of states also have sued the Sackler family personally.\n\nOklahoma, the first state to go to trial, last month won a $572 million verdict against Johnson & Johnson. In addition to settling with Purdue before the trial, it reached an agreement with Teva Pharmaceuticals, a generic drugmaker, for $85 million.\n\nIn another development Wednesday, Polster certified a plan that could allow every municipality in the nation to share in the proceeds if a settlement is reached with all the drug companies. Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys had proposed the novel arrangement to bolster the chances of a sweeping settlement.\n\nPolster called the creation of this negotiation class a \u201cpowerful, creative and helpful\u201d option and reiterated that he hopes it leads to a settlement that would \u201cexpedite relief to communities so they can better address this devastating national health crisis.\u201d\n\nAlthough the state cases are not in Polster\u2019s jurisdiction, he has urged a broad settlement that includes them.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an incredible incentive to make a deal before bankruptcy, because that would make the process much less expensive for the states and cities,\u201d said Adam Zimmerman, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. If Purdue sought bankruptcy protection without a settlement, \u201cwe might see any kind of arrangement tied up in bankruptcy court for a very long time.\u201d \u201cIt could be years,\u201d he added.\n\nYost, who wants the states to control the legal effort against the pharmaceutical industry, has asked a federal appeals court to delay or halt the federal trial. Another 13 states and the District of Columbia have filed briefs in support of that effort, according to Yost\u2019s office.\n\nYost criticized using two Ohio counties as \u201cbellwether\u201d cases, saying they represent only a tiny portion of the state\u2019s 88 counties.\n\n\u201cThe rest of Ohio \u2014 and Ohio itself \u2014 is being left behind in the MDL lawsuit in Cleveland,\u201d he said in a statement late last month. \u201cThe hardest-hit counties of Appalachia and the vast majority of the state are being asked to take a number and wait \u2014 and that wait could delay or prevent justice.\u201d\n\nZimmerman characterized the conflict as a struggle for control of the legal process.\n\n\u201cI think the main motivation [for Yost] has to do with who holds the balance of power with respect to negotiating a global settlement,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is kind of a Hail Mary.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nSacklers could hold on to most of personal fortune in proposed Purdue settlement\n\nOpioid crackdown forces pain patients to taper off drugs they say they need\n\nAs lawyers zero in on drug companies, a reckoning may be coming", "description": "If the deal becomes final, it would be the first comprehensive settlement in the broad legal effort to hold drug companies accountable for their role in the opioid epidemic.
