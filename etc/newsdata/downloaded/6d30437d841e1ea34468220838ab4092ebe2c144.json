Now you may think you have no more room in your make-up bag for another palette, but we\u2019ve done some serious testing to find you options that are worth the splurge.\n\nYou usually get what you pay for with eyeshadows, cheaper brands tend to have less pigment, are often harder to blend and sometimes have a chalky texture that doesn\u2019t last on the skin.\n\nAll palettes that made this roundup had to feature blendable creamy formulas with good longevity \u2013 we did manage to find some excellent buys under \u00a315 that made the grade.\n\nWe also only included easy to apply, crease-free textures. We looked for palettes with a comprehensive colour range, but we didn\u2019t want any peculiar unusable shades that get wasted. More and more palettes include a larger pan for the base shade, which is a very welcome improvement.\n\nA decent brush is a great addition, or no brush at all \u2013 we don\u2019t want to see those rubbish foam applicators that immediately end up in landfill. So whether you want neon brights, or matte nudes, there\u2019s a palette to suit every taste and skin tone in this pick of the best.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

The pigmentation and colour payoff is excellent and we love the molten texture formula of the jewel tones \u2013 not quite a pressed powder shadow, but not entirely creamy either. This makes them easy to blend and gives great longevity. Probably at the upper end of our acceptable palette price bracket, but carefully chosen colours to suit all skin tones combined with beautiful textures ensures there isn\u2019t a wasted shade here.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nDelilah Cosmetics colour intense eyeshadow palette in jezebel, nine shades: \u00a334, Delilah Cosmetics\n\nThis isn\u2019t a new launch, but it is a classic and one that we have used probably more than any other palette in the last year. The shades are some of the prettiest neutral tones we\u2019ve seen and come in a delightfully handbag sized palette. Velvet matte and shimmery textures come in nudes, pale pinks, golds, minks and gun metal greys which blend seamlessly with each other.

We particularly love the off-white shade \u201ctrust issues\u201d, a sparkling white gold with reflective lime green tones. On the skin these shades look fierce, not fearsome.\n\nBuy now\n\nVictoria Beckham Beauty eye brick in tuxedo, four shades: \u00a348, Victoria Beckham Beauty\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been hiding under a rock, you will know that Victoria Beckham\u2019s new make-up line has been the pipeline for sometime. Her social media channels have been awash with teasing glimpses of the brand and it finally launched in September to critical acclaim.\n\nShe\u2019s worked with one of the world\u2019s leading makeup brains Sarah Creal (formerly global head of make-up development at Estee Lauder) as co-creator, so we expected great things. It did not disappoint. We tested the tuxedo eye brick, a mink, dove grey, and intense charcoal shade quad, with a double size nude base colour. The shades are housed in a weighty tortoise shell style component, which opens flat out for ease of use on the go, and the shadows deliver a satin-matte finish which applies smoothly.\n\nBeckham\u2019s line is eco-conscious from start to finish; the make-up is cruelty-free and free from harmful toxins and the packaging is made from recycled material and minimal plastic, which arrives in biodegradable foam.
