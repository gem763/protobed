Robinson (@MsChaunceyKR) September 30, 2019\n\nIn the fictional Star Wars story, Stormtroopers are the ground force of the Galactic Empire under the leadership of one of the most notable evil characters in pop culture history: Darth Vader. The irony that the young Kushner was dressed up as the \u201cbad guy\u201d of the franchise was also a point of reference.\n\nKid is dressed as a stormtrooper and they talk about \"The Force\", you honestly cannot make up the stupidity of this family. \u2014 Paul D. Peters (@PaulDPeters44) September 29, 2019\n\nOthers saved their criticism for Hamill, claiming the actor attacked an innocent child dressed up as a favorite character. The Daily Beast\u2019s Tom Sykes said the tweet made Hamill look \u201cstupid and petty,\u201d writing, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to make yourself look mean-spirited and intolerant next to the Trumps but, somehow, Hamill managed it.\u201d Scores of Twitter users also blasted Hamill for what they saw as an unwarranted attack on a child.\n\nAD\n\nWhat a cheap shot you sad bitter man. \u2014 Brian Cates (@drawandstrike) September 29, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s a child in a Star Wars costume, Mark \u2014 Chet Cannon (@Chet_Cannon) September 29, 2019\n\nHamill responded to the bubbling controversy Monday morning. A Twitter user on Sunday posted a zoomed-in version of the shot of Theodore \u2014 sans parents and other distractions \u2014 with the caption, \u201cForget the parents\u2026 this kid rocks.\u201d Hamill retweeted the cropped photo with his own stamp of approval: \u201cAgreed,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut Hamill returned his attention to the commander in chief with another Trump-bashing hashtag later in the afternoon. \u201cHow are your bone spurs doing these days?\u201d he tweeted at the president. \u201cI\u2019m worried they might prevent you from serving in any \u2018Civil War-like fracture.\u2019 #FracturedFootSoldier.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of healing, how are your bone spurs doing these days?
