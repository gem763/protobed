Here\u2019s how she did it.", "language": "en", "text": "caption Bianca DiValerio relaxing outside her tiny home. source Courtesy of Bianca DiValerio/Miss Mazuma\n\nBianca DiValerio is a flight attendant who has achieved financial independence through the \u201cFinancial Independence, Retire Early\u201d method and writes a blog called Miss Mazuma.\n\nShe calculated her annual expenses to be about $24,000, then saved 25 times that amount \u2013 about $600,000 \u2013 to become financially independent.\n\nDiValerio credits owning property, nearly doubling her work hours, shopping in bulk, and curbing unnecessary spending with helping her achieve her goal.\n\nShe plans to continue working part time until 2022, when she can retire from her airline with full benefits.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nLike many working people, Bianca DiValerio is biding her time until she can retire. But unlike many working people, she actually has enough money to do it.\n\nAt 40, DiValerio has achieved financial independence \u2013 defined as the ability to live comfortably without having to work \u2013 through a method known as FIRE, or \u201cFinancial Independence, Retire Early.\u201d After 18 years as a flight attendant, she\u2019s just about ready to embrace life as a retiree.\n\nHer journey to financial independence began with a post on the personal-finance blog Mr. Money Mustache called \u201cThe Shockingly Simple Math Behind Early Retirement,\u201d which said that the key to retiring early is minimizing expenses and saving as much of your income as possible.\n\nYour \u2018retirement number,\u2019 the amount of money you need to save to live in retirement, is 25 times your annual spending\n\ncaption DiValerio in Thailand.

I didn\u2019t even know at that time,\u201d DiValerio said. \u201cI knew what I was making every month, and I\u2019ve tracked my net worth since 2012 for no reason other than I was a money nerd, but I didn\u2019t ever think about tracking my expenses.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, she began tracking every cent. First, she experimented with making drastic cuts to see just how little she could live on. She canceled her cable service, stopped going to restaurants, and shopped in bulk. Her expenses that year totaled $18,278.\n\n\u201cOnce I learned that formula of early retirement, to me, spending $18 on a glass of wine versus spending $18 on a box of wine at home and having your friends over made way more sense,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re still able to do the same things \u2013 you just kind of change a little bit of the facets to them.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, she decided to spend the way she normally would and compare the results. That year, her expenses added up to $23,292, and she worked off that number (rounded up to $24,000) to set her FIRE number.\n\nShe set out to save 25 times her annual expenses of $24,000 to reach her retirement number of $600,000 \u2013 and she did it\n\ncaption Financial independence at its finest. source Courtesy of Bianca DiValerio\n\nThere are a few ways she managed to reach her goal so fast.\n\nFor one thing, she doesn\u2019t pay rent. Up until the housing-market crash in 2008, DiValerio invested in real estate. She still owns a few properties, but she realized she needed a new plan after a series of short sales. Despite the setbacks, she was able to keep living rent-free as she saved for her retirement number.\n\nIn her work as a flight attendant, DiValerio earns an hourly wage. By nearly doubling her hours as she worked to \u201caggressively\u201d save money, she nearly doubled her income as well, she said.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have children or any major health issues that would run up large bills. She also learned to recognize the difference between wants and needs when it came to her spending.\n\n\u201cA lot of people walk into Target these days and have no idea why they\u2019re walking out with a $250 bill,\u201d she said. \u201cHalf of the things they just bought were things they didn\u2019t even know existed two minutes before \u2026 and all of a sudden it becomes a need instead of a want.\u201d\n\nThough she has enough money to retire now, DiValerio plans to keep working \u2018very, very part time\u2019 until 2022, when she can retire with full benefits from her airline\n\ncaption DiValerio is working on fixing up a tiny home inside a refurbished caboose. source Courtesy of Bianca DiValerio/Miss Mazuma\n\nWhile she doesn\u2019t spend mindlessly on impulse purchases anymore, she\u2019s happy to have a long retirement ahead of her. She\u2019s working on fixing up one of her properties, a tiny home inside a refurbished caboose in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. She walks dogs as a side hustle. And she shares her story as a featured speaker at events for the FIRE community and on her blog, Miss Mazuma.\n\n\u201cEveryone talks about \u2018spoiling yourself,'\u201d she said. \u201cYou can do that all day, but I\u2019d much rather have the time off of work and get to be around my friends and family and do things that I\u2019m passionate about.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - Bianca DiValerio used the \"Financial Independence, Retire Early\" method to overhaul her spending and save enough money for early retirement..
