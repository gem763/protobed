He said Mr. Byard \u201cwould have been very good, but we\u2019re also very happy with the man who\u2019s acting, who has been acting.\u201d\n\nThe White House made the formal notification Thursday in a list of withdrawn nominations provided to the Senate.\n\nMr. Byard is currently serving as associate administrator for FEMA\u2019s Office of Response and Recovery. In a letter to acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan asking to withdraw his nomination, Mr. Byard said he would continue to serve in that role. Lawmakers in recent days had acknowledged problems with Mr. Byard\u2019s nomination, without providing details about their concerns. Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.), the chairman of the Senate committee that oversees FEMA, told Politico last week: \u201cThere were some issues raised that are being investigated and that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say about it.\" A FEMA spokeswoman said Wednesday that Mr. Byard is a \u201cwell-respected emergency manager\u201d and that the agency can\u2019t comment on \u201caccusations made regarding a personal matter that allegedly occurred prior to Mr. Byard\u2019s tenure with the agency.\u201d The agency\u2019s last administrator, Brock Long, resigned in February after he came under fire for his unauthorized use of government vehicles.
