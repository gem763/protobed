REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage/File Photo\n\nBiden, the former vice president, has become ensnared in the political furor over reports that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden and his son, an issue that has intensified Democratic calls for Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\nWhile Trump admits he discussed Biden with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July phone call, he has deflected questions about it and focused instead on raising unfounded charges that Biden improperly tried to halt a Ukrainian probe of a company with ties to his son, Hunter.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden and his son are corrupt,\u201d Trump told reporters on Monday when asked about the controversy on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meetings in New York. He did not provide any evidence.\n\nIn the short term, the uproar has given Biden and his campaign a chance to portray Trump\u2019s strategy as evidence the president sees him as the likely winner, and most dangerous opponent, among the 19 candidates seeking the Democratic nomination to face him in the November 2020 election.\n\nBut in the long term, Biden\u2019s candidacy and perceptions of his electability could be hurt by the possibility that Trump\u2019s repeated charges of corruption could stick to Biden and undercut Democratic arguments about Trump\u2019s abuses of power.\n\n\u201cIf there is one thing Donald Trump can do well, it\u2019s label and isolate a message that is memorable. He\u2019s a salesman,\u201d said Joel Payne, a Democratic strategist who worked for Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to create this corruption, D.C. insider storyline about Biden,\u201d he said. \u201cIt allows him to dust off the play-book and run the same campaign against Biden that he ran against Clinton.\u201d\n\nThe Republican National Committee on Monday sent reporters a memo headlined \u201cQuid Pro Joe,\u201d trying to make the case that Biden had a history of \u201cswampy dealings.\u201d\n\nIn a Democratic race driven heavily by voter perceptions of electability and each contender\u2019s perceived chances of beating Trump, that could help turn what has been a strength for Biden into a potential liability.\n\nBut Democratic voters will automatically discount most of what Trump says, said Patrick Murray, a pollster at Monmouth University. What could be more telling, he said, is Biden\u2019s response.\n\nHOW DOES HE FIGHT BACK?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the electability question comes in. Does Biden have what it takes to fight back when Donald Trump throws a punch? It could certainly help Biden,\u201d Murray said.\n\nBiden and his campaign seemed to take that sentiment to heart. After a hesitant response when the story first broke on Friday, they kicked in later with a furious reaction, with Biden telling reporters that Trump knows \u201cI\u2019ll beat him like a drum.\u201d\n\nEven in an increasingly contentious Democratic nominating race, however, his presidential rivals are unlikely to criticize Biden over Ukraine for fear of standing on the same side as Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I don\u2019t think we should give Trump the power to change the subject from him doing something as nefarious as what he did,\u201d Democratic contender Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, told reporters in Iowa on Monday.\n\n\u201cSecondly, I haven\u2019t seen any evidence of anything there anyway. And third, we have to remember that he will either find a vulnerability or make one up,\u201d he said of Trump.\n\nMost of the other Democratic candidates have not weighed in on the controversy, although U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren referenced it over the weekend in Iowa while renewing her call for Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\n\u201cHe has solicited another foreign government to attack our election system. It is time for us to call out this illegal behavior and start impeachment proceedings right now,\u201d Warren said.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani has suggested that Biden improperly used his influence to get Ukraine to dismiss its top prosecutor, who was investigating Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings but had also been criticized by the U.S. government and the European Union for larger issues. Biden and his son have denied the charge.\n\nGiuliani seemed happy on Monday to see the question of Biden and Ukraine front and center in the news.\n\n\u201cEvery one of the newspapers had articles about it yesterday,\u201d he told Fox Business Network. \u201cBiden was asked about it for the first time on Saturday. Biden was asked about it on Sunday. You start asking Biden, he\u2019s going to fall apart.\u201d", "description": "The growing flap over whether President Donald Trump used his office to seek re-election help from his Ukrainian counterpart poses political risks, and some opportunities, for Democratic White House front-runner Joe Biden.", "authors": ["John Whitesides", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433125320&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M24P", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
