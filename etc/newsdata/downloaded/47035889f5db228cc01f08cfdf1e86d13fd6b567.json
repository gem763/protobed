Maybe that's a good thing.", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-04", "text": "Among the Democratic presidential contenders, those with a background in the private sector have been notable only for their lack of success with voters so far.\n\nJohn Hickenlooper co-founded a successful brewing company in Colorado. He's already out of the race. John Delaney was once the youngest CEO on the New York Stock Exchange. His biggest campaign moment was probably when Elizabeth Warren roasted him on the debate stage.\n\nMaybe that's not a bad thing for the economy.\n\nProfessor Robert McElvaine has studied businessmen as president. \"I was just startled to see how badly things had gone under presidents who were successful in business,\" he told Yahoo Finance. McElvaine, who teaches at Millsaps College in Mississippi, analyzed data from Herbert Hoover until 2012 and found that \"the ones who had been successful in business were pretty much disastrous as far as what happened in the economy.\"\n\nJimmy Carter and both President Bushes spent significant time in the private sector and were then criticized for their economic stewardship in office. Harry Truman had a business background as well as economic growth as president; McElvaine notes that Truman \u201chad very unsuccessful business experience.\u201d\n\nMcElvaine's 2012 study found a bipartisan trend. Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Ronald Reagan, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower all had minimal business experience but saw significant economic gains during their terms.\n\n\"Things that lead to success in business are not necessarily the things that work in the economy as a whole,\" he said.\n\nGraphic by David Foster/Yahoo Finance More\n\nOther studies have turned up similar results. A website called the 5minuteeconomist.com ranked post-World War II presidencies based on a metric called the Economic Performance Index, which combines inflation, unemployment, budget deficits, and GDP growth. Reagan, Obama, Clinton, John F. Kennedy, and Lyndon Johnson came out on top. Donald Trump was not yet included in the ranking.\n\nA lack of business experience in the 2020 field\n\nAmong the leading candidates looking to replace President Trump, excessive business experience is not a problem.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris came into politics after being a prosecutor. Sen. Elizabeth Warren's path was via academia. Sen. Bernie Sanders was running for office just a few years after graduating college, as was Joe Biden. The future Vice President, who was barely 30 years old when he was sworn into the Senate, was reportedly talking about becoming president while he was still in college.\n\nOne small exception is South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. He worked for about three years as a consultant at McKinsey & Company. During an event at the Commonwealth Club of California in April, he touted his McKinsey experience as a formative one. \"I learned how data works,\" he said, adding that he carried the experience with him into his time as mayor when he \"tried to have a more data-driven government at a time when I felt like a lot of decisions were being made by the seat of the pants.\"\n\nOther candidates with business backgrounds have found some traction in the race. Beto O'Rourke started a web design business in El Paso. He doesn't hide the experience, but his campaign biography focuses just as much attention on his time in a punk rock band as on his firm.", "description": "Among the Democratic contenders, those with a background in the private sector have been notable only for their lack of success.", "authors": ["Ben Werschkul", "Dc Producer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aPpTucUi42VLz3XoG68v.A--~B/aD0xNDQwO3c9MTQ0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/285fe1b0-cf26-11e9-bf97-b68f02470066"}
