But in the heavenly White House this weekend, it worked the other way round. Lord Trump took the life of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and then gave life back to Isis by telling us all that he\u2019d promised to send its surviving murderers to the borders of the UK and other European nations.\n\nHow the Isis lads must have chuckled at this extraordinary offer. How their comrades still gestating within our frontiers must have taken heart at such a suggestion. We have raged mightily and for years against the vicious cult of Isis. But we counted without the Trump cult.\n\nTrue, Trump\u2019s particular insanity is not as costly in innocent lives as that of Isis (unless, of course, you happen to be Palestinian or Kurdish or one of Sisi\u2019s 60,000 political prisoners). And given that the Americans and the Russians have both claimed to have killed al-Baghdadi before, it might be wise to let the statutory three days pass just in case the wretched man pops up on yet another video. We killed Osama four times before we actually got him, you may remember.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut this time Trump even thanked Russia, Syria and Iraq \u2013 Syria, perhaps, being the Assad regime? If so, certainly something to be debated in the presidential palace in Damascus whose army has been fighting Isis \u2013 among many others \u2013 for more years than the American military.\n\nBut for Trump to say that the support of European nations was a \u201ctremendous disappointment\u201d because they wouldn\u2019t take back their Isis members and adding that, \u201cI actually said to them, if you don\u2019t take them, I\u2019m going to drop them right on your border and you can have fun capturing them again\u2026 They could walk back \u2013 they can\u2019t walk to our country. We have lots of water in between our country and them\u2026\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. World news in pictures Show all 50 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

That was a real motivation for the Isis survivors.\n\nIf it was like \u201cwatching a movie\u2019\u201d, then of course we had to have the Trump Hollywoodian touch.\n\nAnd sure enough, Trump told us that Baghdadi \u201cdied like a dog, he died like a coward\u2026 crying, whimpering and screaming\u201d. Well, maybe. That sounds more like how children die. His three children, to be precise. It\u2019s a bit difficult to see al-Baghdadi crying and screaming in his supposedly \u201cdead-end\u201d tunnel while fumbling for his suicide belt (proving, of course, that he always guessed the Americans would come calling). As for claiming that the world \u201cis now a much safer place\u201d, well let\u2019s wait and see. These Islamist cults usually have a chrysalis leader waiting to take the place of the dead. Or an even worse version of their own cruel institution.\n\nAs usual, we\u2019ll also have to wait another few days to find out how many other innocents were killed in this raid. To suggest that they were all Isis members is also a bit Hollywoodian.\n\nBe sure of one thing, the original story of the Baghdadi raid is going to change. We shall learn more. Was there Israeli involvement? How much help did the Russians give? Or the Syrians? Or the Kurds? Or perhaps even Isis itself, if they happened to be tired of their vile leadership? Or just some guy who wanted the \u00a319.5 million\u2026\n\nBut for the moment, Trump shines like a halo in the eyes of his Republican supporters. If his army \u2013 and remember, given the military\u2019s own support for Trump, it probably is his army \u2013 can kill the world\u2019s most wanted terrorist, then what\u2019s all this impeachment nonsense from America\u2019s own internal Democratic enemies? How can you compare killing Baghdadi and making the world safer with all this mumbo jumbo about Ukraine?\n\nAnd Trump could watch almost all of it live. Like Obama watched the killing of Osama. Well, in an age where you can livestream the death of innocents, at least they got the bad guys.", "description": "Usually, the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.
