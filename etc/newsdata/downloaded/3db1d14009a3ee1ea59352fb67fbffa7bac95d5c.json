Take a look below (spoilers, obviously)\u2026\n\nWhat happened in the end of The Walking Dead season 9?\n\nThe ninth season of The Walking Dead was notable for the departure of Andrew Lincoln\u2019s Rick Grimes, the arrival of the Whisperers and that time jump.\n\nFollowing Andrew Lincoln\u2019s confirmation he was set to leave in series nine \u2013 causing the inevitable heartbreak among TWD fans \u2013 the character narrowly escaped death after he was impaled and left for dead with walkers closing in.\n\nRick\u2019s fate was left hanging in the balance but he was rescued by helicopter (Picture: AMC)\n\nHe almost met his maker after trying to blow himself and them up, but ultimately left his fate hanging in the balance when he was saved by a helicopter which whisked him away \u2013 potentially leaving the door open for a future return.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile the Whisperers, led by Alpha (Samantha Morton) became enemy number one \u2013 and with the arrival of Gamma (Thora Birch), a newcomer in their ranks, this isn\u2019t likely to end any time soon in season 10.\n\nAlpha brought the Whisperers to season 9 (Picture: AMC)\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget that time jump which brought things forward by six years and led to the departure of Maggie (Lauren Cohan) \u2013 who we later learned had left camp a year earlier.\n\nAway from all the build-up we bid farewell to season nine with two notable events.\n\nThe first of these came in the shape of one of the show\u2019s most brutal episodes ever, with 10 characters falling victim to a massacre at the hands of the Whisperers during the Kingdom fair, and having their heads mounted on pikes.\n\nAll this and Negan (Picture: AMC)\n\nAmong those who met a grisly end were newfound Hilltop leader Tara (Alanna Masterson) and Carl\u2019s former girlfriend Enid (Katelyn Nacon) as well as Henry (Matt Lintz), Tammy Rose (Brett Butler), Highwayman leader Ozzy (Angus Sampson), Alek (Jason Kirkpatrick and former Savior DJ (Matt Mangum).\n\nThe series came to a dramatic end with a storm which saw all the survivors moving to Hilltop \u2013 and the return of Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) who saves Judith (Calley Fleming) with things ending on a cliffhanger as a voice came through on the radio asking if anybody was there.\n\nWhen is The Walking Dead on?\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThe series begins on Fox on Monday night at 9pm followed immediately by spin-off series The Talking Dead at 10.05pm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you miss any episodes you can catch up with them via Sky\u2019s On Demand service or via NOW TV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
