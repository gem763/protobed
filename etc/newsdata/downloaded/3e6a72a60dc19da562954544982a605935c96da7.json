But her acting career has spanned decades, and Reuters was quickly called out for overlooking her other roles instead of focusing on playing Spider-Man\u2019s love interest.\n\n\u201cWhen I think Kirsten Dunst, I think Interview with a Vampire, Bring it On, The Virgin Suicides, and Fargo. I literally never think \u2018Spider-Man\u2019s girlfriend\u2019,\u201d tweeted Imani Gandy, a legal analyst and podcast host.\n\nJesse McLaren, a verified Twitter user followed by more than a million users, responded to the Reuters tweet by seemingly referencing a 1999 comedy about former President Richard Nixon co-starring Ms. Dunst.\n\n\u201cIf you refer to Kirsten Dunst as \u201cSpider-man\u2019s girlfriend\u201d you clearly don\u2019t know Dick,\u201d Mr. McLaren tweeted.\n\nReuters ultimately deleted the tweet before reposting the video with a different caption: \u201cAward-winning actress Kirsten Dunst receives a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\u201d\n\nMs. Dunst made her acting breakthrough in 1994, earning a Golden Globe nomination for her role playing a child vampire in \u201cInterview with the Vampire\u201d starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. More recently, she won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress in 2011 for her starring role in the art film \u201cMelancholia.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
