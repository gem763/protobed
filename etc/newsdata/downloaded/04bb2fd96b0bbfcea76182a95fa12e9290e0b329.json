Reach Deal That Could End Strike", "language": "en", "text": "In the last five years, as American consumers flocked to high-margin trucks and sport utility vehicles, both G.M. and its unionized work force have prospered. In the last three years, G.M. has made $35 billion in profit in North America, and workers have been given annual profit-sharing checks averaging $11,000.\n\nBut even though G.M. was scaled down in bankruptcy, it still has excess production capacity. The company has enough plants to make about one million more vehicles than it is selling, according to the Center for Automotive Research, an independent, nonprofit group.\n\nAt the same time, G.M. is spending heavily to develop electric vehicles and self-driving technology, and its business outlook is uncertain. Auto sales have slowed in the United States, and some analysts expect a substantial decline in new-vehicle sales in 2020. Sales in China, the world\u2019s largest auto market, have also softened.\n\nMark Wakefield, a managing director at AlixPartners, a consulting firm with a large automotive practice. said automakers were expected to spend some $225 billion over the next five years on development of electric and self-driving vehicles. \u201cIndustry profit is still good, but it\u2019s down from its peak of a few years ago,\u201d he said. The combination of heavy spending and slowing sales \u201chas created some problems for them.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one reason that G.M. has been eager to retain flexibility in the size and deployment of its work force. Among the issues in dispute was the extent of G.M.\u2019s use of temporary workers \u2014 now 7 percent of its head count \u2014 and their path to full-time status.\n\nMarisol Gonzalez-Bowers worked for G.M. at Lordstown for about 24 years, most recently in \u201cmaterials,\u201d transporting parts to the assembly line. Relocating after the shutdown, she recently took a job at the company\u2019s Lansing Delta Township plant in Michigan, where she was trained to assemble the insides of doors \u2014 the wires and plugs. Her trainers were almost all classified as temporary workers, she said, though they had been there four years.", "description": "The accord, which needs ratification by a majority of the company\u2019s 49,000 union workers, could end a strike that has idled plants for a month.", "authors": ["Neal E.
