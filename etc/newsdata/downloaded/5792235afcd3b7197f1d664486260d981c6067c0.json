As the Sixties got into gear, she was in town to shoot the movie I Could Go On Singing (1963), for English director Ronald Neame. It proved to be her final big-screen role. Garland plays Jenny Bowman, star of the concert stage, who is here to pack out the London Palladium during one of her international tours. As drama with a semi-autobiographical dimension, it is a fitfully fascinating film and boasts one or two electrifying sequences. Chief of these is the one where Garland is seen in the wings of the Palladium, psyching herself up for a big entrance. Her face positively looms with expectant delight. She jiggles in an agitated dance of anticipation. Her palms thwack together to the beat of the magnificent orchestra as it builds and builds. She spurs it on with a roar of \u201cGo!\u201d. It leaves the viewer with a matchless sense of what it must be like to be a hugely talented performer swaying on the brink of delivering herself to an adoring public\n\nThere is a special reason why the Jenny character bursts out to give even more than her all at that particular performance. Out in the stalls, clutching his programme and agog with excitement is her 10-year-old son from an affair with a distinguished English surgeon, who is played (with an astute instinct for how best to support Garland) by Dirk Bogarde. The son has been brought up by the surgeon to believe he was adopted from another family. His actual mother now longs to see him \u2013 the great star having to infiltrate her boy\u2019s life under the guise of a shy, painfully eager and exotic tourist who can offer him fun treats like these tickets to her show. Garland is brilliant at conveying the anguished jauntiness, laced with genuine joy, that this involves\n\nThe horrors of the MGM studio system \u2013 which could subject a sensitive child star such as Judy to a slave labour regime of uppers, downers, starvation rations and the dubious privileges that come with being the boss\u2019s favourite \u2013 is filtered through the protagonist\u2019s 46-year-old psyche\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nSo there\u2019s a pointed link between the circumstances dramatised in that underrated old film and the more fraught and sprawling situation, at the other end of the decade, that is evoked in the new movie Judy. It\u2019s directed with shrewd insight by the Almeida\u2019s artistic director, Rupert Goold \u2013 the latest in the interesting tradition of perceptive Englishmen who have served Garland well. It stars a hotly Oscar-tipped Ren\u00e9e Zellweger: the actress strikes the signature Judy poses (microphone-lead trailed over the shoulder, etc) with strung-out sensitivity and opens her lungs with admirable finesse as well. We are introduced to the hard-working diva at the moment she realises she\u2019s caught in a horrible real-life Catch 22. Flat-broke, zonked, evicted from her hotel suite, she yearns to be able to set up a stable home for Lorna and Joey, her children by third husband Sid Luft. She can\u2019t afford to turn down the chance to do a series of concerts and accepts an invitation to play a season at London\u2019s Talk of the Town nightclub (now the Hippodrome). But this will put an ocean between herself and her kids and may well torpedo her credibility in the pending battle over custody. If she could go on not singing... would that make her any less unhappy?\n\nOne can think of many ways in which this movie could have gone badly wrong. By succumbing, say, to Gothic camp: Whatever Happened to Baby Judy in full collision with a secular, substance abuser\u2019s Stations of the Cross. Or it could have fetched up as A Grotesquely Funny Thing Happened On the Way to Carnaby Street with an Edvard Munch respray of the Munchkins. Instead, Goold\u2019s film has been lucidly pondered so as to be surgically incisive without being sensational. The horrors of the MGM studio system \u2013 which could subject a sensitive child star such as Judy to a slave labour regime of uppers, downers, starvation rations and the dubious privileges that come with being the boss\u2019s favourite \u2013 is filtered through the protagonist\u2019s 46-year-old psyche. The soundstage of The Wizard of Oz is the purgatory from which she will never be granted an exeat. This conceit, developed with intelligent restraint, suggests the palette of Goold\u2019s movie, while the structural quirks of Oz are echoed (in reverse) in Judy by the way characters who feature in the fantastical frame are able to resurface as, say, the two devoted, middle-aged gay fans who shyly waylay their heroine in the forlorn, wet streets of London.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The 20 greatest movie musicals 1/20 The Wizard of Oz (1939) All the tricks and gimmicks of today\u2019s filmmakers could never upstage The Wizard of Oz\u2019s grand reveal, as Dorothy (Judy Garland) takes her first step into cinema\u2019s bold, technicolour future. Eighty years later, and the effect is still breathtaking. MGM\u2019s legendary musical adaptation of L Frank Baum\u2019s children\u2019s book, nominated for six Academy Awards, not only cemented Garland\u2019s early stardom, but continues to transport those both young and old to a world where imagination is the only limit. Most memorable track: \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow\u201d Rex Features 2/20 Moulin Rouge! (2001) Madonna, The Beatles, Nirvana, and The Police found themselves transported to the streets of 1900s Montmartre for Baz Luhrmann\u2019s jukebox musical. Yet, as giddy and eclectic as Luhrmann\u2019s directorial approach may be \u2013 making him one of Hollywood\u2019s most unique creative forces \u2013 Moulin Rouge!\u2019s doomed love story of a penniless writer (Ewan McGregor) and a courtesan (Nicole Kidman) is still grounded in the same sweeping romanticism that fuels the classic operas from which Luhrmann took his inspiration, including La traviata and La boh\u00e8me. Most memorable track: \u201cCome What May\u201d Rex Features 3/20 Singin' in the Rain (1952) Hollywood has (and will forever remain) in love with itself, but no other single film has ever quite shared that joy with audiences in the way Singin\u2019 in the Rain does. A light-hearted parody of the industry\u2019s transition from silent film to sound, MGM struck gold with its stars Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O\u2019Connor. All three play off each other with both spirit and wit, while demonstrating unmatched technical ability: from the delightful tap routine of \u201cGood Morning\u201d, O\u2019Connor\u2019s pratfalls in \u201cMake \u2018Em Laugh\u201d, to Kelly\u2019s now iconic umbrella dance. Most memorable track: \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain\u201d AFP/Getty Images 4/20 Top Hat (1935) It\u2019s a tough decision to determine which of the 10 musicals Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers co-starred in represents the very best of their work. The dance team are responsible for some of the most graceful, accomplished routines ever captured on film \u2013 and there\u2019s no denying they made a perfect pair. As Katharine Hepburn is said to have noted: \u201cHe gives her class and she gives him sex appeal.\u201d Yet, it\u2019s Top Hat that remains their most fondly remembered collaboration, as a screwball romance of mistaken identities plays out across a series of glamorous locales in London and Venice. Most memorable track: \u201cCheek to Cheek\u201d Rex Features 5/20 Cabin in the Sky (1943) Cabin in the Sky has a complex legacy, and it\u2019s difficult to judge how exactly it should be remembered. On the one hand, it\u2019s a radical work, as a rare example of a musical with an all-black cast produced during Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age. Although it was released by MGM and even nominated for an Oscar, the film was banned in several US cities on its release. However, as the product of a major Hollywood studio in the 1940s, the film is guilty of troubling racial stereotyping in its depiction of folksy, childlike black characters. Although this must be taken into account, the film remains a major part of film history, especially as it provides an opportunity to see some of the greatest black performers of the era \u2013 including Ethel Waters, Lena Horne and Louis Armstrong \u2013 in one place. It was also the debut film of Vincente Minnelli, who went on to direct the likes of Gigi (1958) and An American in Paris (1951). Most memorable track: \u201cHappiness is a Thing Called Joe\u201d Rex Features 6/20 An American in Paris (1951) The height of class and elegance, An American in Paris rises to the top of MGM\u2019s crop of musicals thanks to its George Gershwin score and its unforgettable 17-minute ballet sequence, which cost almost half a million dollars to film. Imagined as a fevered daydream of the film\u2019s main character, Jerry (Gene Kelly), the sequence is a riot of colour and twirling skirts, as Jerry and his love (Leslie Caron\u2019s Lise) traverse across a series of theatrical sets, each stylised to evoke a famous French painter. La La Land\u2019s epilogue sequence is a direct reference to the film. Most memorable track: \u201cI Got Rhythm\u201d Rex Features 7/20 The Sound of Music (1965) The third highest-grossing film of all time (when adjusted for inflation), Robert Wise\u2019s adaptation of the stage musical has remained a source of great comfort over the decades. Drawing from the true story of the von Trapp family, who escaped Nazi-invaded Europe to continue their musical career in the United States, the film allows us to believe, even momentarily, in a world where kindness, joy and optimism is all that\u2019s needed to shield us from the evils of the world, as exemplified by Maria (Julie Andrews) herself. Most memorable track: \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d Rex Features 8/20 West Side Story (1961) This wasn\u2019t simply William Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo and Juliet reheated for a new generation. West Side Story injected new blood into one of our greatest tragedies, exposing how relevant the story remained in a decade as divided as the 1960s, when America faced conflicts both on a global scale, in the Cold War, and at home, with continuing racial tensions within the US. As the Jets, the white American gang, and the Sharks, the Puerto Rican gang, fight for control of their New York neighbourhood, two lovers cross the battle lines to offer the hopeful message that love will save us all. Most memorable track: \u201cTonight\u201d Rex Features 9/20 Cabaret (1972) The inarguable peak of Bob Fosse\u2019s career as a director and choreographer, Cabaret exemplifies exactly what\u2019s possible within the musical genre. Utilising the Weimar Republic\u2019s booming nightlife scene as a backdrop for the rise of the Nazi Party, Cabaret could be sexy, glamorous, dark, and sinister in equal measure, exploring topics that were largely taboo at the time (including abortion) while still delivering the musical\u2019s traditional exuberance, anchored in Liza Minnelli's magnetic lead performance. Most memorable track: \u201cCabaret\u201d Rex Features 10/20 The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) The ultimate cult musical, once described by critic Roger Ebert as more of \u201clong-running social phenomenon\u201d than a film, The Rocky Horror Picture Show now comes with its own rules and traditions \u2013 you can either be enlisted to dress up and perform alongside the film, or join in with one of the many callbacks that fans all know by heart. It\u2019s a testament to the film\u2019s glorious, schlocky embrace of B-movie history and its message of feel-good sexual liberation and gender fluidity. Most memorable track: \u201cThe Time Warp\u201d Rex Features 11/20 Bugsy Malone (1976) Bugsy Malone is an idea that never should have worked on film: would we really sit and indulge in a cast of children playing pretend cops and gangsters? Yet, under Alan Parker\u2019s direction, and thanks to Paul Williams\u2019s riotous lineup of songs, the film is not only a delight, but feels oddly subversive in the way its cast so gamely fill the roles of wisecracking ne'er-do-wells \u2013 a smart way to parody the cultural obsession with the machismo of the gangster genre. Most memorable track: \u201cYou Give a Little Love\u201d Rex Features 12/20 Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) While the film may have earned its place in the history books thanks to Marilyn Monroe\u2019s now iconic performance of \u201cDiamonds Are a Girl\u2019s Best Friend\u201d \u2013 frequently revisited, whether by Madonna or Moulin Rouge!\u2019s Satine \u2013 Gentlemen Prefer Blondes also deserves to be heralded for including one of cinema\u2019s greatest double acts. Monroe and Jane Russell are formidable as two best friends on the hunt for the ideal husband, with Russell\u2019s witty cynicist providing the perfect counterbalance to Monroe\u2019s goofy bombshell. Most memorable track: \u201cDiamonds Are a Girl\u2019s Best Friend\u201d Rex Features 13/20 Dancer in the Dark (2000) The film\u2019s production history has been mired in controversy after its star, Bj\u00f6rk, alleged that she had been sexually harassed by a \"Danish film director she worked with\", with the Los Angeles Times later identifying the accused as Dancer in the Dark\u2019s Lars von Trier. He has denied the allegations. However, it\u2019s hard to deny the film\u2019s cultural significance, as one of the most startling and groundbreaking musicals of the 21st century. Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s score adds incredible compassion to the story of an immigrant factory worker who finds herself betrayed by the world and its cruel machinations. Most memorable track: \u201cI\u2019ve Seen it All\u201d Rex Features 14/20 Chicago (2002) Rob Marshall, whose last film was Disney\u2019s Mary Poppins Returns, has become the go-to director for the modern Hollywood musical. Having also directed Nine (2009) and Into the Woods (2014), his best work is easily Chicago, which became the first musical to win Best Picture since Oliver! in 1968. It\u2019s a film that dutifully pays homage to its stage origins, including Bob Fosse\u2019s original choreography, while still feeling slick and modern in its invocation of the 1920s and its lurid culture of celebrity criminals. Most memorable track: \u201cAll that Jazz\u201d Rex Features 15/20 My Fair Lady (1964) Director George Cukor knew he had two key ingredients when it came to his take on the musical adaptation of George Bernard Shaw\u2019s Pygmalion: Audrey Hepburn and the gorgeous stylings of Edwardian London. And so, My Fair Lady\u2019s most delightful image remains Hepburn\u2019s Eliza Doolittle, engulfed by an enormous black and white hat, hollering at a race horse to \u201cmove your bloomin\u2019 arse!\u201d Doolittle\u2019s resilience and fierce sense of independence endures today, 50 years after the film was first released. Most memorable track: \u201cI Could Have Danced All Night\u201d Rex Features 16/20 The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964) Arguably, the film could could be described more as an opera than a musical, since every line of dialogue is sung, accompanied by Michel Legrand\u2019s score \u2013 but it\u2019s also a work that feels purely cinematic, in love with how much life and colour can be conjured in every frame. The film remains one of the most purely romantic entries in cinematic history, as Genevi\u00e8ve (Catherine Deneuve), a teenage girl working in her mother\u2019s umbrella\u2019s shop, pines after her lover (Nino Castelnuovo) after he\u2019s drafted to fight in Algeria. Most memorable track: \u201cJe ne pourrai jamais vivre sans toi\u201d Rex Features 17/20 The Lion King (1994) The Disney animated musical is almost a genre unto its own, considering how much it has to offer, but if one film must tower above the rest, it\u2019s almost certainly The Lion King. Released at the height of the studio\u2019s renaissance in the 1990s, the film recasts Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet in the African savannah, offering an epic story that deals with themes of destiny and responsibility, without skimping on the humour. If an entire generation is now scarred by the infamous stampede scene, it\u2019s a price worth paying. Most memorable track: \u201cCircle of Life\u201d 18/20 Mary Poppins (1964) Much more than the screen debut of Julie Andrews, Mary Poppins has endured in the hearts of so many because of how it spoke to children: directly, but with a wit that never dared to patronise them. Knowing Mary was to be in on the great secrets lost to world-weary adulthood, and to be welcomed into the bountiful world of imagination and play \u2013 as beautifully represented in the Sherman brothers\u2019 musical score and the film\u2019s combination of live-action and traditional animation. Most memorable track: \u201cA Spoonful of Sugar\u201d Rex Features 19/20 Grease (1978) Although Grease will largely be remembered for its karaoke-primed tunes, what\u2019s often forgotten is how subversive the film actually proved to be at the time of its release. Grease helped break barriers when it came to the teen film, featuring characters (especially female characters) who speak frankly and openly about sex. As much as Sandy (Olivia Newton-John)\u2019s \u201cbad-girl\u201d transformation can elicit eyerolls today, the scene isn\u2019t as simple as a woman changing herself in order to impress a man \u2013 it\u2019s also a kickback against the stifling sexual norms of American society. Most memorable track: \"You're the One That I Want\" Rex Features 20/20 La La Land (2016) La La Land\u2019s legacy is now forever tied to the great snafu of 2017\u2019s Academy Awards, but there\u2019s more to Damien Chazelle\u2019s modern musical than a besuited Ryan Gosling trying to suppress an embarrassed giggle on the Oscars stage. A love letter to the genre\u2019s history, it\u2019s a film that both pushes forward while looking back, much like the ill-fated lovers at the centre of its story. Memorable track: \u201cCity of Stars\u201d Rex Features 1/20 The Wizard of Oz (1939) All the tricks and gimmicks of today\u2019s filmmakers could never upstage The Wizard of Oz\u2019s grand reveal, as Dorothy (Judy Garland) takes her first step into cinema\u2019s bold, technicolour future. Eighty years later, and the effect is still breathtaking. MGM\u2019s legendary musical adaptation of L Frank Baum\u2019s children\u2019s book, nominated for six Academy Awards, not only cemented Garland\u2019s early stardom, but continues to transport those both young and old to a world where imagination is the only limit.

Most memorable track: \u201cI Could Have Danced All Night\u201d Rex Features 16/20 The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964) Arguably, the film could could be described more as an opera than a musical, since every line of dialogue is sung, accompanied by Michel Legrand\u2019s score \u2013 but it\u2019s also a work that feels purely cinematic, in love with how much life and colour can be conjured in every frame. The film remains one of the most purely romantic entries in cinematic history, as Genevi\u00e8ve (Catherine Deneuve), a teenage girl working in her mother\u2019s umbrella\u2019s shop, pines after her lover (Nino Castelnuovo) after he\u2019s drafted to fight in Algeria. Most memorable track: \u201cJe ne pourrai jamais vivre sans toi\u201d Rex Features 17/20 The Lion King (1994) The Disney animated musical is almost a genre unto its own, considering how much it has to offer, but if one film must tower above the rest, it\u2019s almost certainly The Lion King. Released at the height of the studio\u2019s renaissance in the 1990s, the film recasts Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet in the African savannah, offering an epic story that deals with themes of destiny and responsibility, without skimping on the humour. If an entire generation is now scarred by the infamous stampede scene, it\u2019s a price worth paying. Most memorable track: \u201cCircle of Life\u201d 18/20 Mary Poppins (1964) Much more than the screen debut of Julie Andrews, Mary Poppins has endured in the hearts of so many because of how it spoke to children: directly, but with a wit that never dared to patronise them. Knowing Mary was to be in on the great secrets lost to world-weary adulthood, and to be welcomed into the bountiful world of imagination and play \u2013 as beautifully represented in the Sherman brothers\u2019 musical score and the film\u2019s combination of live-action and traditional animation. Most memorable track: \u201cA Spoonful of Sugar\u201d Rex Features 19/20 Grease (1978) Although Grease will largely be remembered for its karaoke-primed tunes, what\u2019s often forgotten is how subversive the film actually proved to be at the time of its release. Grease helped break barriers when it came to the teen film, featuring characters (especially female characters) who speak frankly and openly about sex. As much as Sandy (Olivia Newton-John)\u2019s \u201cbad-girl\u201d transformation can elicit eyerolls today, the scene isn\u2019t as simple as a woman changing herself in order to impress a man \u2013 it\u2019s also a kickback against the stifling sexual norms of American society. Most memorable track: \"You're the One That I Want\" Rex Features 20/20 La La Land (2016) La La Land\u2019s legacy is now forever tied to the great snafu of 2017\u2019s Academy Awards, but there\u2019s more to Damien Chazelle\u2019s modern musical than a besuited Ryan Gosling trying to suppress an embarrassed giggle on the Oscars stage. A love letter to the genre\u2019s history, it\u2019s a film that both pushes forward while looking back, much like the ill-fated lovers at the centre of its story. Memorable track: \u201cCity of Stars\u201d Rex Features\n\nGoold talks animatedly about what drew him to the material. \u201cI\u2019m fascinated by the late, late style of performers who were once at the top of their game \u2013 Johnny Cash, Roger Federer \u2013 and how they husband what is left of it to carry on.\u201d In the theatre, he\u2019s had experience of needing to shove and heave incapacitated thesps onto the boards. This happens, of course, to the vodka-soaked, pill-popping Garland, frogmarched down the long, tiled corridors of the Talk of the Town by Rosalynd, her very firm, exasperated but very caring assistant. Is it a bit perverse, I ask, of a theatre director to want to commit such an inherently live event to celluloid? (Before it was adapted into a screenplay by Tom Edge, the material began life as Beyond the Rainbow, a stage play by Peter Quilter. We talk about how a movie camera has the capacity to shift between capturing inner and outer loneliness. And, just as in Zellweger\u2019s portrayal of the beleaguered icon, a movie camera has a pensive flexibility of manoeuvre; an actor can suggest, more minutely than in the theatre, the psychological roots of a performance style without needing to offer an exhaustive impersonation of it.\n\nGoold reveals that at one stage there was to have been a scene where Garland visited a secret gay bar in London where she was confronted by a drag version of herself. They couldn\u2019t get it to work within the rhythm of the story. He also reveals that when Judy was test-screened, it got its highest approval ratings from young women. Not everything about it works. I beg leave to doubt that \u2013 even at a time of literally depending on the kindness of strangers \u2013 she ever found herself making a pivotal long-distance call to her kids from a red telephone box. I wonder too if it undersells the fact that the actual opening night at the Talk of the Town was an enormous success. The Financial Times critic wrote that \u201cshe is the Maria Callas of popular music\u201d. It was only later that things slid so regrettably into insult and food-throwing.\n\nI yield to no one in my admiration for Garland\u2019s artistry and for the therapeutic force of her warmly wayward presence. I love how Garland\u2019s singing voice swings rather than throbs with heartbreak. My absolute favourite bit of her is her treatment of the song \u201cChicago\u201d on a 1964 TV transmission of The Judy Garland Show. Her voice is thrilling in its elasticity; she\u2019s almost manic with the joy of the song and the desire to share its jokes: \u201cThey have the time, the time of their life/ I saw a man who danced with his wife/ In Chicago...\u201d\n\nI was worried the film would be one of those stomping-on-the-grave exercises, but it\u2019s suffused with affection and respect for its heroine. However low she falls, you never doubt that there are redeeming features in Judy Garland that cannot help but inspire love in others. Zellweger has clearly watched a stack of the TV interviews she gave (all there on YouTube) in which, regardless of how \u201cover-refreshed\u201d she was at the time, Garland\u2019s wicked, sly, generous humour always emerges. On the bad evenings during that season at the Talk of the Town, she sang \u2013 desperately, drunkenly \u2013 about how she loved London and its people above all her tour-stops. Londoners scarcely showed themselves in their best light by throwing things at her. Is it poetic justice that this movie \u2013 which, in its very uncloying way, makes a kind of amends \u2013 is the work of a London-based director?\n\nShe led Ronald Neame a terrible dance when he directed her in I Could Go On Singing. Her incorrigible lateness wreaked havoc on carefully laid plans \u2013 such as sessions booked at the Palladium with expensively hired extras to pose as her public. It seemed, initially, that she was adding insult to injury when she bade farewell to the unit with the prophecy that they would miss her when she was gone. In a filmed tribute to her, the veteran director had to fight tears when recalling how quickly her comment came to feel achingly accurate. Judy is not the last word on the subject, nor does it pretend to be. But it\u2019s a healthy reminder of a valuable truth. Despite or perhaps because of her demons, Judy Garland \u2013 singer, hoofer, actress, symbol \u2013 stands firm as the most life-enhancing entertainer of her era.\n\nJudy is in UK cinemas from Friday", "description": "Judy Garland\u2019s final decade was bookended by professional engagements in London. As the Sixties got into gear, she was in town to shoot the movie\u00a0I Could Go On Singing (1963), for English director Ronald Neame. It proved to be her final big-screen role. Garland plays Jenny Bowman, star of the concert stage, who is here to pack out the London Palladium during one of her", "authors": ["Paul Taylor"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/01/13/judy-garland-renee-zellweger.jpg"}
