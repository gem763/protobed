Arguably no Kardashian look, though, has generated more buzz than the custom Thierry Mugler dress she wore to the annual Met Gala in May.\n\nThe look was designed so Kardashian would appear as though she had emerged, dripping wet, from the ocean and walked straight to the Upper East Side of Manhattan in Lucite heels without drying off. In a shade of nude-pink reminiscent of the inside of a seashell and adorned with iridescent beads, the latex dress clung to her hourglass figure. The reality star\u2019s quasi-natural curves were exaggerated beyond belief with a corset, creating the illusion that her red-carpet prep involved surgically removing a rib or two.\n\nKardashian\u2019s glam squad kept the makeup simple with a taupe smoky eye and her hair clung to the sides of her face in shiny black ringlets. The theme of the night was camp, and Kardashian and Mugler hit the nail on the head. As revealed in Sunday night\u2019s episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, however, the cinched, mid-length dress almost didn\u2019t make it to the Met steps when Kanye West, Kim\u2019s husband, refused to give his approval.\n\nThe head-turning outfit was the result of eight months of laborious planning, a gravity-defying corset, and a bit of light, self-inflicted torture, as Kardashian could neither pee nor breathe deeply once zipped into the dress. Much of last night\u2019s episode documents her commitment to the dramatic fashion moment, offering viewers a glimpse into such thought processes as whether she should wear an adult diaper or, in the case of an emergency, simply pee her pants and enlist one of her (unlucky) sisters to \u201cwipe my leg up.\u201d Sitting down at any point in the night was out of question, and she had to practice taking tiny steps up the stairs without losing her balance.\n\nYet, in spite of all the effort his wife and her team put into preparing for the event, which is essentially the Oscars of the fashion world, West tried to convince her to change her look. Oh, and he decided to broach the subject the night before the Gala.\n\n\u201cLike, the corset, the underwear, all that vibe,\u201d he begins in the clip, launching into a monologue. \u201cI just feel like I went through this transition from being a rapper, like, looking at all these girls and looking at my wife like, \u2018Oh, my girl needs to be just like the other girls showing her body off, showing this, showing that.\u2019\u201d Kardashian, curled up in a monogrammed hotel bathrobe, wordlessly continues tapping away at her iPhone, perhaps pretending not to hear her husband\u2019s complaints in the hopes that he\u2019ll just stop talking.\n\nInstead, he doubles down, segueing to his newfound spirituality. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it was affecting, like, my soul and my spirit,\u201d West adds, asking rhetorically, \u201cA corset\u2019s like a form of underwear, it\u2019s hot. It\u2019s hot for who though?\u201d At this point, Kardashian\u2019s loyal squad of assistants, stylists, and Jonathan Cheban begin exchanging eye rolls as their rightfully pissed-off leader tries to explain to Kanye that he is giving her anxiety. In a show of unabashed selfishness at best and caveman misogyny at worst, West replies, \u201cYou are my wife and it affects me when pictures are too sexy.\u201d\n\nWhile this conversation would raise red flags under any circumstances, it is especially infuriating when you consider how vocal Kimye has been in the past about the way the controversial rapper controls his wife\u2019s image. Up until his apparent change of heart earlier this year, he would routinely dress her in skin-tight spandex outfits from his Yeezy collections, calling her his muse, but treating her like his own personal Barbie doll.\n\nIt is disheartening to hear Kardashian talk about West\u2019s controlling and obsessive behavior when it comes to her style. She often frames it as something she is grateful for, a favor he did for her. In a 2015 interview on Live with Kelly and Michael, she said, \u201cI always thought I had really good style, until I met my husband and he told me that I had the worst style. He was really nice about it and cleaned out my whole closet.\u201d Because nothing says nice like reducing your new girlfriend to tears by telling her all of her shoes are ugly and making her throw them in the garbage.\n\nBeyond bullying Kardashian into changing her wardrobe, West specifically encouraged her, through his words and through the clothes he gave her, to embrace a sexy, bombshell persona. Take, for example, this quote from a 2013 Harper\u2019s Bazaar profile in which the \u201cLife of Pablo\u201d singer gushes about Kardashian\u2019s propensity for \u2019gramming naked selfies.\n\n\u201cI love her nude selfies. Like, I love the ones from the side, the back ones, and the front,\u201d he told Bazaar. \u201cI just love seeing her naked; I love nudity.\u201d In the same interview, he hilariously remarked, \u201cI think it\u2019s important for Kim to have her figure. To not show it would be like Adele not singing.\u201d He objectified her through song lyrics and even had her straddle a motorcycle, completely naked, in the 2013 \u201cBound 2\u201d music video, while he appeared to be fully clothed in a tie-dyed t-shirt.\n\nIt is, then, particularly hypocritical for the rapper to take issue with the couture dress Kardashian chose to wear back in May and it is likely tied to his recent spiritual awakening (or money-making scheme). Since January, West has basically been reinventing himself as a pseudo-religious leader, headlining church-inspired Sunday Service gospel concerts. He has attracted a congregation of other A-listers, including Brad Pitt, Chance the Rapper, and Justin and Hailey Bieber, while also opening up his \u201cservices\u201d to the public in New York and Wyoming.\n\nThough those close to West are reluctant to describe what he is doing as preaching, the weekly events are rooted in Christianity. With an upcoming album titled Jesus is King, an accompanying IMAX film, and pending trademarks for a variety of pricey \u201cchurch clothes,\u201d West\u2019s coming-to-God moment doubles as a lucrative business venture.\n\nKardashian, thankfully, refused to be moved by the classic \u201cyour sexy pictures hurt my soul\u201d line. \u201cYou built me up to be like this sexy person and [have] confidence and all this stuff,\u201d she told West, calling him out on his hypocrisy. \u201cJust because you\u2019re on a journey and you\u2019re on your transformation doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m in the same spot with you.\u201d\n\nWhile this may not mean a return to the chunky wedge sandals and Herve Leger bandage dresses of her pre-Kanye years, it is undoubtedly satisfying to see Kim stand up for herself.", "description": "\u201cYou are my wife and it affects me when pictures are too sexy,\u201d the rapper whined to Kim Kardashian, trying to get her to change outfits the night before the Met Gala.", "authors": ["Jordan Julian"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571102992/191014-kanye-controlling-tease_wlksds", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
