Over the weekend, people close to Andrew talked to CNN and presented a new claim of how the Prince\u2019s friendship ended over a threatened lawsuit.\n\nAccording to interviews with three people with direct knowledge of the events, Epstein grew irate in late February 2011 after the New York Post published a photograph of the prince walking in Central Park with Epstein in late December 2010. The accompanying article, headlined \u201dPrince & Perv,\u201d generated a barrage of negative publicity about the prince\u2019s years-long friendship with Epstein. On March 7, 2011, Sarah Ferguson admitted publicly that she had accepted GBP 15,000 ($24,000) from Epstein to help pay an employee to whom she owed money. On the advice of her publicist, James Henderson, the Duchess gave an interview to London\u2019s Evening Standard in which she expressed extreme contrition for her lack of judgment by accepting the funds from Epstein. With the interview, she put a clear divide between herself and Epstein. \u201cI abhor pedophilia,\u201d she said, adding that she\u2019d had no knowledge of Epstein\u2019s alleged relationships with under-age girls when she took the money. According to Henderson, Epstein\u2019s reaction to Ferguson\u2019s statement was swift and dramatic. First Henderson received what he described as a \u201cdeeply unpleasant\u201d phone call from Epstein, who threatened Henderson with a defamation lawsuit if a statement was not issued retracting the word \u201cpedophile.\u201d\n\nThere were more threats from Epstein\u2019s lawyers, but nothing ever came of the lawsuit. Sarah Ferguson never retracted her comment about him.\n\nThe problem with Prince Andrew\u2019s new defense is that, clearly, Sarah Ferguson knew what the allegations against Epstein were by that point. She called him a \u201cpedophile\u201d for a reason. So why is it that Epstein\u2019s threatened lawsuit was enough to rouse the Prince\u2019s ire but the fact that Epstein was a convicted sex offender didn\u2019t seem to bother him up to that moment? Again, this was several years after Epstein\u2019s conviction and after he\u2019d been released from jail.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing for Andrew to claim he didn\u2019t know what Epstein was doing in private. In my opinion, even that seems like a stretch. But it\u2019s something else to claim Andrew didn\u2019t know about the very public conviction and jail sentence which made him a registered sex offender.\n\nLast week, Virginia Roberts told Dateline that she had sex with Andrew, at the behest of Epstein and his right-hand woman Ghislaine Maxwell, when she was just 17 years old.\n\n\u201cGhislaine said he\u2019s coming back to the house and I want you do to for him what you do for Epstein,\u201d she says in the interview. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d Giuffre says the encounter took place first in the bathroom and then the bedroom. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t rude or anything about it, but he said thank you \u2013 some kind of soft sentiment like that \u2013 and left.\n\nThere is a well-known photo of Andrew with his arm around Roberts which she said was taken the day this happened in the same apartment. The Prince\u2019s defenders have previously suggested the photo might have been manipulated because the fingers visible on Roberts\u2019 waist appear too \u201cchubby.\u201d I guess the latest defense is an improvement over that but it\u2019s still not very convincing.", "description": "\"The\u00a0accompanying article, headlined \u202f'Prince & Perv,' generated a barrage of negative publicity...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Andrew-Epstein.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
