In Denmark, lower borrowing costs have cushioned the blow for some banks and spurred a record number of Danes to try to improve their mortgage loans.\n\nSpar Nord said it raised its full-year guidance because of strong activity in its mortgage business and \u201cpositive value adjustments on bonds due to the persistent decline in interest rates.\u201d\n\nAt the end of July, Danish homeowners took advantage of ultra-low interest rates to pay down mortgages worth 137 billion Danish crowns, the biggest refinancing wave yet.\n\nOn Monday, lender Kreditbanken also revised its full-year guidance upward, citing strong activity in the housing market, as well as fewer impairments than expected.\n\nIts chief executive, Lars Frank Jensen, said interest rates had a \u201cclear advantage\u201d for banks\u2019 earnings in the short term due to higher fee incomes and yields on rising bond prices.\n\n\u201cIt will clearly be net-negative for banks in the long term,\u201d Jensen told Reuters.\n\nDenmark\u2019s central bank governor said last month that large banks continue to see \u201chigh earnings\u201d despite negative interest rates.\n\nAccording to the central bank, Danish lenders lost 1 billion Danish crowns ($146.86 million) on their deposits in the central bank in 2018, but generated earnings of about 40 billion crowns in the same period.\n\nSeparately, the Danish banking lobby Finance Denmark said in a statement on Tuesday that banks\u2019 earnings were declining despite extraordinary income from refinanced mortgages.\n\n\u201cAmong the driving factors are low interest rates,\u201d it said.\n\nLast week, Spar Nord became the third bank in Denmark this year to start charging wealthy clients on large deposits in a bid to transfer some of the costs of negative rates to private clients.", "description": "Danish lenders Vestjyske Bank and Spar Nord raised their profit guidance on Tuesday, saying they expect a boost from high activity in the country's mortgage business, which has been fueled by negative interest rates.", "authors": ["Nikolaj Skydsgaard", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
