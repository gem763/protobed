Some people prefer a classic griddled thin patty, others settle for nothing less than a gourmet burger on brioche. We take the stand that no one\u2019s wrong in this fight \u2014 an Animal-style Double-Double at In-N-Out can be just as satisfying as a chef-driven creation, depending on your mood.\n\nSo we decided to look to Yelp to figure out what customers themselves think are the best burger joints in the U.S. MONEY consulted with Yelp\u2019s data team to pinpoint the 20 highest-rated restaurants identified as burger-focused. Interestingly, major chains failed to make the cut, no doubt owing to the fact that Yelpers tend to gravitate (and obsess over) their local mom-and-pop joints.\n\nTo spread the love, we limited the list to a maximum of two restaurants per state, and we required at least 100 Yelp reviews for a venue to qualify. One other twist: With well-executed vegetarian and vegan cuisine on the rise across the country, non-meat options actually made inroads on the list. \u201cOne of the biggest trends we\u2019ve seen on Yelp is the rise of the Impossible Burger and plant-based burger alternatives,\u201d Yelp\u2019s trend expert Tara Lewis says. \u201cThe Impossible Burger was nearly nonexistent on Yelp before 2016, but spiked in 2018 and is on track to be one of the biggest food searches of 2019.\u201d\n\nBut, of course, there are plenty of meaty options to be had \u2014 and there\u2019s a decent chance one of these affordable restaurants isn\u2019t far from you. Did your favorite make the cut? Let the debate begin.\n\n(Note: Yelp\u2019s best-of algorithm is based on several factors, including but not limited to overall star rating. It also takes into account the total volume of reviews.)\n\n1. Burgerama, Valley Village, California\n\nRating: 5/5 stars\n\nCost: $$\n\nNestled in the San Fernando Valley of greater Los Angeles, Burgerama specializes in gourmet burgers that run the gamut from the carnivorous (the Country Boy, topped with bacon, jack cheese, onion rings, and bourbon sauce) to vegetarian-friendly (the Veggie Lover, with portobello, provolone, coleslaw, saut\u00e9ed garlic, and avocado).\n\n2. Chicks N Cows, Los Angeles, California\n\nRating: 5/5 stars\n\nCost: N/A ($9 for a Double Smash\u2019d Burger)\n\nA street vendor with its own patio setup, Chicks N Cows gets straight to the point with its name.
