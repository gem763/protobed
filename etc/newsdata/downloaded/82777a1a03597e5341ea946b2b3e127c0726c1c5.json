That led to a big divide on review site Rotten Tomatoes between top reviewers (only 33% of whom liked it) and regular people (99% of whom loved it). Comedian Bill Burr seems to be going after the same cancel culture progressives in his own just-released comedy special. Here\u2019s a summary of some of the content from Decider:\n\nHere, he gets into the razor-edged material right off the bat: He mocks someone who says he\u2019s been \u201ctriggered.\u201d He says a movie role in which Bryan Cranston plays a quadriplegic is \u201cacting,\u201d and if they\u2019d gotten a real quadriplegic to play the role, that\u2019s \u201cjust laying there reading something someone else wrote.\u201d Before long, Burr says feminists are \u201cfull of shit,\u201d and launches his rage-bazooka at \u201cmale feminists.\u201d He says the #MeToo movement devolved into calling out men for \u201cbad dates.\u201d He wonders what men should do with women \u201cwho like it a little rough.\u201d He calls out an audience member for cheering the idea of the first woman U.S. president: \u201cYou don\u2019t even know what her f\u2014ing platform is, and you automatically cheer!\u201d He soon reveals that he knows exactly what he\u2019s doing: \u201cBy the way, this is going to be my last show ever.\u201d\n\nApparently the tone of the show gets less aggressive and more reflective about halfway in. A reviewer at Vulture said the first few minutes of the show live up to the billing of a broadside against cancel culture but as the show goes on the jokes change:\n\nFor the first several minutes, he flips quickly through complaints about the overanalysis of jokes, how white women are to blame for the current lamentable state of culture in the United States, and jokes about disabled characters being played by able-bodied actors. In his biggest and most convincingly risky swing, the first few minutes include a bit about Michelle Obama. Burr, in full character as angriest man in the world, is not a Michelle fan. It is an opening segment that dares you to turn the special off in disgust\u2026 The thing is that once Burr moves past that part of the special \u2014 once he gets through the sexist throat-clearing and the tick-the-box list of rebellious trollish vocab \u2014 the rest of the special is different.\n\nMaybe the backlash to the backlash against Dave Chappelle is causing reviewers themselves to be more reflective. Or maybe there hasn\u2019t been enough time for the #CancelBurr hot takes to really get going. We\u2019ll have to give it another week to find out. Meanwhile, Burr isn\u2019t shying away from the controversy. In an interview with Forbes, Burr pointed to the hypocrisy behind political correctness:\n\nThere\u2019s all this weird thing where everybody in public is the most caring person ever\u2013and then they go back to the exact life they were living when they go home. And I understand it. Its heart is in the right place, but they . . . You can\u2019t just change words and think that will change people\u2019s attitudes.\n\nHere\u2019s a NSFW trailer for the special:", "description": "\"...everybody in public is the most caring person ever\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bill-Burr.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
