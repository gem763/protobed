Escher\u2014you\u2019ll see his influence in the mundane labyrinths of Control, the disorienting symmetry of the stealth game Echo, or in the clever puzzles of games like Monument Valley and echochrome. You can now add Manifold Garden to that list. And, like those other games, it\u2019s pretty damn great.\n\nOut today on Apple Arcade and the Epic Games Store, Manifold Garden is a minimalist puzzle game played from a first-person perspective. You begin in a plain room, and after a spare tutorial teaches you the basics of movement, you\u2019re set loose to wander through a mind-bending maze of stairs, corridors, and strange rooms full of machines made almost entirely of right angles.\n\nManifold Garden\u2019s most disorienting trick is that you can flip gravity by hitting a button whenever you\u2019re facing a flat surface. That surface is your floor now. It doesn\u2019t take as long as you might think to wrap your head around, largely thanks to some clever design\u2014while the rooms and corridors of Manifold Garden have a muted colour palette approaching monochrome, they actually have a colour assigned to them that you can\u2019t see from afar but fades in as you get closer. So an off-white wall will move towards violet as you get closer and become full-on purple once you trigger your gravity flip and have its surface beneath you. It does a lot to keep you from losing your damn mind.\n\nLike a lot of clever puzzle games, Manifold Garden teaches you how its world works through play. It\u2019ll present you with coloured cubes for opening doors, and then in a later room show you a keyhole that you need to flip gravity to get to. But once you do that, you learn another rule: You can only pick up cubes when standing on a surface that matches their colour.\n\nManifold Garden\u2019s simple, aesthetically pleasing design makes it soothing to play through, even if it is often dizzying. Its world is infinite; you are surrounded by countless copies of the structure you are navigating, suspended in an endless void. If you leap off the edge of a platform, you will fall forever, continually passing the ledge you jumped from until momentum carries you back to where you started. It\u2019s a trip, man.\n\nI like to think Escher was a game designer born too soon, fascinated with the strict rules of mathematics and how they can be followed into a maze of the nonsensical. That\u2019s what games are, sometimes\u2014bewildering towers erected from rigid code, somehow folding together to form a thing that seems to defy simple logic.\n\nYou should play Manifold Garden, but perhaps not on a smartphone. You can\u2019t get a good look at infinity on a screen that small.", "description": "Video games are quite fond of the work of M.C.
