You may not have seen Justin Bieber\u2019s version of the viral video, though.\n\nOn Monday, the video shot by Hailey Bieber and posted to her Instagram stories went viral. And although it\u2019s no longer on her profile, Swifties found the video \u2013 and called the Biebers out.\n\nSEE THE VIDEO HERE:\n\n?? | Justin Bieber mocks Taylor\u2019s Jimmy Fallon interview clip of Taylor after Lasik Surgery via Instagram Live pic.twitter.com/oPPAsMvQk1 \u2014 Taylor Swift Updates (Backup) (@TSUpdatesNYBU2) October 7, 2019\n\nHailey quickly tweeted an apology directed at one of Taylor\u2019s fans, angered by the model\u2019s video.\n\n\"I never knew I could make somebody so upset... truly I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re THIS upset?! Lord have mercy I hope I\u2019m never this upset about someone I don\u2019t know!![sic]\"\n\n\"listen. I think it\u2019s awesome how passionate you are and how hard you ride for someone you\u2019re a fan of, it\u2019s beautiful how dedicated you are. If there\u2019s something I did to personally hurt you or offend you I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s not my intention to upset you by any means[sic],\" she wrote.\n\n\"but being angry at someone you don\u2019t know does nothing for you. I know cause I been there.. all it\u2019s gonna do is make you miserable. Don\u2019t let ME of all people get you feeling that way. Trust me, I\u2019m not worth the energy, nobody should be worth that energy![sic]\"\n\nHailey has since removed her tweets, but fans are still quite upset.\n\n\"He\u2019s a bully,\" commented one user, another said, \"Imagine how tired we are.\"\n\nThe comments could have much to do with the fact that this isn\u2019t the first time Justin\u2019s mocked Taylor.\n\nWhen Taylor publicly revealed Scooter Braun owns the right to six of her records, after Justin\u2019s unwavering support for his friend and manager, she also attached a screenshot of the Sorry singer\u2019s 2016 Instagram post which showed him FaceTiming Scooter Braun and Kanye West. The captioned on the post that has since been deleted read, \"Taylor Swift what up,\" reports E! News.\n\nAccording to Just Jared, Justin apologised to Taylor shortly after, calling his post \"hurtful\" and \"distasteful\", though it seems his latest video may have just reignited their feud.", "description": "Swifties are feuding with the Biebers over this viral video.", "authors": ["Bashiera Parker", "Bparks_"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9445/0a1a058577ef41588823ffb14839c68f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
