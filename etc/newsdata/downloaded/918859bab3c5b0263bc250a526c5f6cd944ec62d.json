And then, less than 24 hours later, a letter arrived to one of the victims saying he had been granted parole...\"\n\nJasriel said she was yet to receive any communication from the department.\n\n'A constant rerape'\n\n\"It's disgusting the way we've been treated. There's something that's just not adding up here.\"\n\nRecalling giving testimony against Hewitt, Jasriel said \"they might as well have raped me during the trial. And [since then] it's just a constant rerape. It's just a constant retraumatisation. I haven't had an opportunity to heal. Every time I feel I'm getting over it, or I'm getting better, then I'm blindsided again.\"\n\nJasriel welcomed Lamola's intervention. \"I am so grateful to him; but again, we should not have had to go through this.\"\n\nShe said not everybody has her resources, suggesting that many similar perpetrators could be released, posing a threat to their victims.\n\n\"I don't believe sexual offenders can be rehabilitated,\" Jasriel told Grootes. \"[Hewitt] should have been given his full six-year sentence and he should think about what he did. He has shown absolutely zero remorse. He has shattered my family, and he's worried about what I did to his family? I didn't do that to his family - he did it to his family.\n\n'I'd rather be dead'\n\n\"My immediate thought is you're sitting on your stoep one afternoon having a cup of tea and next thing you've got a bullet in your head because your perpetrator has [had] a couple of years to plot revenge against you. That is sadly a reality,\" Jasriel said.\n\n\"I would rather be dead than have to go through what I've been through over and over again.\"\n\nJasriel said she and another victim were willing to testify at a parole board hearing.\n\n\"Two years against my lifetime in 'prison' is not okay.\"", "description": "One of the rape victims of former tennis star Bob Hewitt says she is devastated and angry after hearing the news that he is expected to be released on parole on September 23, without consultation with her or other victims.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7795/7d0d11c57e0d4ecb84f814c18485864f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
