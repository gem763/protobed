The Perth accountant had made his fortune by buying into a struggling pathology and diagnostics company in 1992, when he was aged 27, and turning it around. Boyd left Sonic Healthcare\u2019s board as 2003\u2019s list was being published, but Medicare and cashed-up Baby Boomers mean his family\u2019s 3.6 per cent stake was still the main reason he placed 169th on the 2018 Financial Review Rich List, with a $511 million valuation.\n\nGreg Goodman was one of the 2003 Young Rich Listers who was helped by a wealthy background \u2013 his father Sir Patrick Goodman co-founded the Goodman Fielder food manufacturing empire. However, the wealth of $66 million ascribed to him at the time recognised his efforts in building up the family\u2019s industrial property vehicle, Goodman Group. It made a pre-tax profit above $1 billion for the second time in 2017-18, putting Goodman, 55, comfortably on this year\u2019s Rich List in 70th place.\n\nAnother member of the class of 2003 is MYOB co-founder Craig Winkler. In 2009 he took his $125 million cheque from the sale of the desktop accounting software and put $15 million of it into Xero, MYOB\u2019s cloud-based disrupter. That stake is now worth $715 million, but you\u2019ll no longer find Winkler on the Rich List. It emerged this year that the deeply private entrepreneur and active Christian is donating nearly all the money to charity, via the appropriately named Givia trust.\n\nMeanwhile, the richest young Australian of 2003 also rose to the 2018 Rich List, in spirit. John Ilhan, of \u201cCrazy John\u2019s\u201d mobile phone stores fame, died suddenly of a heart attack in 2007. His business partner and widow, Patricia, sold the chain to Vodafone in 2009, reportedly for $150 million. She ranked 194th on the 2018 Rich List with a $407 million fortune, no longer invested in Nokias but in property and managed funds.\n\nThe Young Rich List turns 15 this year and its debutants have grown up. Their fortunes have grown too, mostly.\n\nWho fell off dramatically\n\nThe opposite of the Rich List is where 2003\u2019s fourth-richest Australian under 40, Eddie Groves, found himself after the collapse of his ABC Learning Centres childcare business in 2008. Bankrupted with debts of $23 million in 2013, he of the mullet and snakeskin cowboy boots was permitted by a court to move to Canada, where it was reported he and wife Viryan Collins-Rubie have set up a language school. Groves\u2019 bankruptcy ended in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother 2003 Young Rich Lister to find notoriety after the global financial crisis, Gordon Fell, has kept an even lower profile. On the eve of the GFC, Fell sold his debt-laden real estate business Rubicon Group to the greater fools invested in Allco Finance Group, escaping with the money to buy Sydney\u2019s then-most expensive house, \u201cRoutala\u201d at Point Piper.\n\nCoincidentally, that harbourside home is back on the market with a $55 million price tag, nearly double what Fell paid in 2007. He and wife Phillipa appear to have moved back into the professional property speculation game, in April registering a business called Sequitur Hotels.\n\nFalling the most is former Billabong boss Matthew Perrin who, along with wife Nicole, was number seven on the inaugural Young Rich List. In January he was sentenced to eight years\u2019 jail for fraud and forgery after a jury found him guilty of writing his wife\u2019s signature on loan documents as he tried to bail himself out of bad bets on Chinese shopping centres during the GFC.\n\n'Entrepreneur' not a dirty word\n\nBut most of the class of 2003 have not experienced such Rich List-sized rises or vertiginous falls. They have just been plugging away.\n\nThe editorial in that 2003 issue of BRW proclaimed, \u201cthe entrepreneur is back\u201d. Stories like Perrin\u2019s aside, many more of its inaugural Young Rich Listers have helped stop \u201centrepreneur\u201d becoming the dirty word it was after the dotcom crash, and the Christopher Skase and Alan Bond scandals before that.\n\nOne of the entrepreneurial heroes on that original list is Janine Allis. In 2003 her $14 million fortune was derived from her Boost Juice retail chain, back then amounting to 11 company-owned stores and 62 franchises.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday her empire, known as Retail Zoo, stretches to 500 stores in 14 countries across four brands: Boost Juice, Salsa\u2019s Fresh Mex, Cibo Espresso and Betty\u2019s Burgers. \u201cThere are as many stores overseas as there are in Australia,\u201d Allis tells The Australian Financial Review Magazine about the globalisation of her business over the past 15 years.\n\nThe AFR Magazine Young Rich issue will be on news stands for the next four weeks.\n\nAllis and husband Jeff sold 70 per cent of Retail Zoo to The Riverside Company for nearly $70 million in 2010, before another private equity giant, Bain Capital, swooped in 2014. Allis still has a minority stake in the business. These days she\u2019s a star of Network Ten\u2019s Shark Tank and is also on the board of ASX-listed jewellery retailer Michael Hill.\n\nOlder but having fun\n\n\u201cI\u2019m having a ball really. I\u2019m getting older but I\u2019m having fun,\u201d Allis says. The same could be said for Brett Godfrey, the former Virgin Blue high-flier who these days prefers to walk. Godfrey\u2019s Tasmanian Walking Company has just opened its fourth trail on the island, a 46-kilometre jaunt through the Tasman National Park with a couple of eco-friendly luxury lodges along the way.\n\nGodfrey turned 40 a month before the 2003 Young Rich List was published, and a couple of months later took Virgin Blue public in a deal that added considerably to the $12 million fortune that had placed him 50th. \u201cI can assure you that it didn\u2019t do me any favours at home,\u201d he recalls of the publicity from appearing on the list.\n\nNot only did Godfrey have to sell Australians on no-frills flying, he had to do it fighting tooth and nail against one of the great airline executives in Qantas boss Geoff Dixon. Ironically, Dixon is now his business partner in developing walking tracks on the mainland through the Australian Walking Company.\n\nMatthew Perrin, the former boss of Billabong surfwear, was No. 7 on the inaugural Young Rich List. In January this year, he was sentenced to eight years\u2019 jail for fraud and forgery. Glenn Hunt\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou won\u2019t hear Godfrey complain that 2018\u2019s crop of Young Rich have it any easier than he did. \u201cI think they have it \u2018different\u2019 these days, not better and not worse,\u201d he says. \u201cPre-2000, entrepreneurs were building businesses that usually made \u2018stuff\u2019 or traded \u2018stuff\u2019.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s billionaires have largely come from good or great technology ideas, that thanks to social media and the internet are offered the opportunity to go viral. That didn\u2019t exist 20 years ago, and the near-perfect knowledge prospect it presents can be a huge advantage vis-\u00e0-vis earlier entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nBut while technology entrepreneurs have become a Rich List force, Godfrey still believes there are plenty of opportunities outside it. Indeed, his Tasmanian Walking Company is pitched at getting people into nature and away from their phones, away from social media and the distractions of the web. \u201cEnvironmental tourism is where I leverage my investments and businesses these days,\u201d he says. That\u2019s a business model that could have worked 15 years ago, and almost certainly will be just as much in vogue in 15 years from now.\n\nFinancing now easier\n\nPerth\u2019s Mark Barnaba, who hit the list with an estimated $18 million wealth in 2003 after selling a corporate advisory business, went on to become Macquarie Group\u2019s West Australian chairman. He now sits on the Reserve Bank board and is co-deputy chairman of Andrew Forrest\u2019s Fortescue Metals Group. Barnaba says building your own business and \u201cdoing your own thing and in your own way\u201d is much better understood and valued today than it was 15 years ago.\n\nWhile financing has become easier \u2013 there are more options and better-developed early-stage capital markets \u2013 the pace of change means today\u2019s entrepreneur needs to move faster. \u201cThere is less time today to perfect one\u2019s business model and adjusting quickly to change and to technological innovations isn\u2019t just important, it is essential for survival,\u201d he says.\n\nThat said, the ingredients for success haven\u2019t changed that much. \u201cYou need a good idea, the ability to spot the opportunity others don\u2019t, and extremely hard work.\u201d\n\nWith Fiona Carruthers and Julie-anne Sprague.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AFR Magazine Young Rich issue is out on Friday October 26 inside The Australian Financial Review.\n\nGreg Goodman was one of the 2003 Young Rich Listers who was helped by a wealthy background \u2013 his father Sir Patrick Goodman co-founded the Goodman Fielder food manufacturing empire. The 55-year-old placed No. 70 in this year's Rich List.
