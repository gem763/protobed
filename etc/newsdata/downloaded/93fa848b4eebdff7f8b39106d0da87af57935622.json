In all, more than 5 000 members are required to surrender their weapons.\n\nBut some fragmented, with one breakaway faction purporting to be the military wing of Renamo refusing to participate in the peace deal.\n\n\"If the election campaigning continues, our attacks will continue,\" faction leader Mariano Nhongo told journalists in Beira via video link.\n\nHe claimed that his fighters had been responsible for two recent attacks on the vehicles of provincial heavyweights in the central Manica which left a total of four people injured.\n\nAfter the country gained independence from Portugal in 1975, Renamo fought a brutal civil war against the Frelimo government that left one million people dead before fighting stopped in 1992.\n\nHowever, Renamo never completely disarmed.\n\nEarlier this month Pope Francis heaped praise on the peace deal between government and rebels, but the agreement remains fragile.\n\n\n\nMozambique's President Filipe Nyusi (C-L) and Renamo leader Ossufo Momade (C-R) display the documents after signing a ceasefire agreement in Maputo, Mozambique. (Stringer, AFP)\n\nPresident Filipe Nyusi is hoping for a second term in office at the October polls. His Frelimo party has dominated power for more than four decades and he is expected to win.", "description": "Breakaway Mozambique rebels have threatened to step up violence if campaigning is not suspended for upcoming elections - the first after a landmark peace deal - as they claimed responsibility for two recent car attacks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2396/5ee81e2f3fb744ba8c8956f9e9c6e8b0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
