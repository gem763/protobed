If they don\u2019t impeach him and he wins, they fear being blamed by the Democratic base for not doing enough. Best-case scenario: Dems are left hoping they don\u2019t impeach him and Trump loses on his own.\n\nTRUMP IN NEW MEXICO \u2026 GABBY ORR in Rio Rancho, N.M.: \u201c\u2018You\u2019re doing better than any state in the United States,\u2019 he said. \u2018How do I lose New Mexico? Explain that one. We\u2019re here for a number of reasons, but we\u2019re here because we really think we\u2019re going to turn this state.\u2019\u201d POLITICO \u2026 2016 election results\n\n-- NYT\u2019S PETER BAKER, also in Rio Rancho: \u201cHe singled out a longtime supporter, Steve Cortes, a CNN commentator, who was present. \u2018He happens to be Hispanic, but I\u2019ve never quite figured it out because he looks more like a WASP than I do,\u2019 Mr. Trump said.\n\n\u201cShouting across the arena to Mr. Cortes, the president said: \u2018Nobody loves the Hispanics more. Who do you like more, the country or the Hispanics?\u2019 Mr. Cortes cupped his hands and shouted a reply that was hard to hear.\n\n\u201c\u2018He says the country,\u2019 Mr. Trump interpreted for him. \u2018I don\u2019t know, I may have to go for the Hispanics, to be honest with you. We got a lot of Hispanics. We love our Hispanics. Get out and vote.\u2019\u201d NYT\n\nTEHRAN SAYS NO TURTLE BAY TALKS \u2026 \u201cIran\u2019s supreme leader: No talks with the U.S. at any level,\u201d by AP\u2019s Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran: \u201cIran\u2019s supreme leader announced on Tuesday that \u2018there will be no talks with the U.S. at any level\u2019 \u2014 remarks apparently meant to end all speculation about a possible U.S.-Iran meeting between the two countries\u2019 presidents at the U.N. later this month.\n\n\u201cIranian state TV quoted Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as saying this is the position of the entire leadership of the country and that \u2018all officials in the Islamic Republic unanimously believe\u2019 this. \u2018There will be no talks with the U.S. at any level,\u2019 he said. Khamenei said the U.S. wants to prove its \u2018maximum pressure policy\u2019 against Iran is successful.\n\n\u201c\u2018In return, we have to prove that the policy is not worth a penny for the Iranian nation,\u2019 Khamenei said. \u2018That\u2019s why all Iranian officials, from the president and the foreign minister to all others have announced that we do not negotiate (with the U.S.) either bilaterally or multilaterally.\u2019\u201d AP\n\n-- WAPO\u2019S ANNE GEARAN: \u201cTrump\u2019s dual instincts on Iran: Big threats and an eagerness to deal\u201d: \u201cTrump\u2019s dual approach on Iran is premised on the idea that by walking out of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Tehran and replacing the pact\u2019s concessions with new sanctions, Trump can both please the hawks and force Iran to the bargaining table for a deal that would carry the Trump brand.\n\n\u201cTrump would be the first U.S. president to meet an Iranian president since the 1970s, an idea that appeals to him, said advisers who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the president\u2019s views. He has made an offer that has no precedent since the Islamic republic was born out of a bitterly anti-American revolution in 1979, saying repeatedly that he would sit down with \u2018no conditions.\u2019\u201d WaPo\n\nTHE IRONY: Iranian leaders have now adopted the United States\u2019 position, which is that Iran will not meet with Trump without preconditions.\n\nA REMINDER \u2026 ISRAEL IS VOTING TODAY.

Trump had authorized the bailout funds in response to an outcry from farmers who claimed they were caught in the middle of his trade war with China. Democrats are likely to include legislation that would expedite payment of these funds as part of a must-pass spending bill as soon as this week.\u201d WaPo\n\nIMPORTANT \u2026 SARAH FERRIS: \u201cHouse Democrats have largely agreed to punt an ugly border wall fight with Donald Trump until November, likely averting a shutdown this month \u2014 as long as the president backs the plan.\n\n\u201cThe House is expected to pass a stopgap funding bill this week that maintains the status quo for Trump\u2019s border policies, marking a temporary concession by progressives still fuming at recent hard-line moves on immigration, according to multiple lawmakers and senior aides.\n\n\u201cSenate Republicans, too, say they\u2019re willing to back the short-term bill \u2014 with Trump\u2019s greenlight. That would set up a final showdown around Thanksgiving, which will be Trump\u2019s last chance to deliver on his wall promise before peak campaign season.\u201d POLITICO\n\nPLAY THIS OUT A LITTLE BIT: Congress could easily punt a November fight into mid-December to ensure a Thanksgiving break. It\u2019s really early, but senior aides we talk to are already getting worried about a December shutdown.\n\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

That authorization, announced Aug. 27, was based on what was then determined to be \u2018lower-than-expected contract costs.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut the Defense Department revealed in the Monday filing that the department would not be able to cover the costs of the project.\u201d POLITICO\n\nHAPPENING TODAY -- Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, is testifying before the House Judiciary Committee.

Two other witnesses who were subpoenaed alongside Lewandowski \u2014 former White House aides Rick Dearborn and Rob Porter \u2014 won\u2019t show up at all, on orders from the White House.\u201d\n\n2020 WATCH -- \u201cWarren, in NYC rally, casts campaign as successor to other women-led movements,\u201d by Sally Goldenberg and Alex Thompson in New York: \u201cSen.

In fact, we\u2019re not here because of men at all,\u2019 she proclaimed to loud cheers. \u2018We\u2019re here because of some hard-working women.\u2019\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- ELENA SCHNEIDER: \u201cMichael Bennet releases new TV ads in Iowa\u201d: \u201cThe Colorado Democrat didn't appear on the primary debate stage last week, after failing to reach the criteria set by the Democratic National Committee.

As part of its relationship with the Air Force, President Donald Trump\u2019s Turnberry resort occasionally gifts high-ranking officers a version of its \u2018Pride Pin,\u2019 a lapel pin featuring the property\u2019s iconic lighthouse \u2014 an honor reserved for VIPs \u2014 upon their arrival, according a resort staffer familiar with the practice. Rank-and-file members can expect a more basic welcome package in their rooms, featuring goodies like Scottish shortbread.\n\n\u201cA five-day visit to Turnberry and the surrounding region revealed that the regular visits from Air Force crews on layovers from Prestwick Airport have become a major facet of the life of the resort. It also revealed that, rather than being restricted to single-night refueling stops, some visits last multiple nights, expanding the known dimensions of the relationship between the president\u2019s luxury resort and the U.S. military.\u201d POLITICO\n\nBREXIT LATEST \u2026 JACK BLANCHARD: \u201cA blockbuster trial for the ages kicks off in Westminster this morning as Britain\u2019s most senior judges consider whether the prime minister broke the law by suspending parliament in the run-up to Brexit Day.\u201d London Playbook\n\n-- METAPHOR ALERT: \u201cRather than face heckling from a small but boisterous crowd of demonstrators, [British PM] Boris Johnson skipped a planned outdoor press conference with his Luxembourgish counterpart Xavier Bettel on Monday, leaving his host to deliver a grandstanding lecture on how Brexit had been pursued for Tory Party advantage but with no plan for how to deliver it.\u201d More from POLITICO Europe\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.
