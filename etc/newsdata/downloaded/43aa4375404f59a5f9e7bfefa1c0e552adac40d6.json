It was snapped in Botswana\u2019s Chobe River by wildlife photographer Dafna Ben Nun, 39, who found the resemblance to Nessie \u2018very amusing\u2019.\n\nThis dark shape emerged from Botswana\u2019s Chobe River, looking much like the creature in the famous, faked 1934 photo of Nessie. But on closer inspection it turned out to be a baby elephant swimming with its trunk raised\n\nScientists from New Zealand said last month it was likely the \u2018monster\u2019 of Loch Ness was a giant eel.\n\nMs Ben Nun said: \u2018I went over to Africa to photograph and learn about the wildlife there and I learned that this year is the driest year in the last 20 years so animals are in desperate need of water.\n\n\u2018While photographing on the Chobe river I saw a group of elephants coming in to the river to cool down.\n\nScientists from New Zealand said last month it was likely the \u2018monster\u2019 of Loch Ness was a giant eel\n\n\u2018They crossed the river while diving and splashing and most of the time just leaving their trunk above the water what resembled the Loch Ness monster to me.\n\n\u2018It was very amusing and made me laugh.\u2019\n\nProfessor Neil Gemmell, a geneticist from New Zealand\u2019s University of Otago, said: \u2018There is a very significant amount of eel DNA. The sheer quantity of the material says that we can\u2019t discount the possibility that there may be giant eels in Loch Ness. Therefore we can\u2019t discount the possibility that what people see and believe is the Loch Ness Monster might be a giant eel.\u2019", "description": "A dark shape emerged from Botswana's Chobe River, looking much like the creature in the famous, faked 1934 photo of Nessie.
