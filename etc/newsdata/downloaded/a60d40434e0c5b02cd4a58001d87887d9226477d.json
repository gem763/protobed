However, falling short of a majority meant the Liberals would have to rely on an opposition party to pass legislation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not quite the same as 2015. It\u2019s not all owing to the leader,\u201d said Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto. \u201cTrudeau is prime minister because the rest of the party was able to pull itself together and prevail. While Trudeau certainly deserves credit for what has happened he\u2019s really going to have to demonstrate qualities that he hasn\u2019t yet shown.\u201d\n\nStill, the results were a victory for Trudeau, whose clean-cut image took a hit after old photos of him in blackface and brownface surfaced last month.\n\nMore: Justin Trudeau apologizes again, blames 'privilege' as third blackface instance emerges. Here's what we know\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised at how well Trudeau has done,\u201d said Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody expected Trudeau to get a majority but they are not that far off.\u201d\n\nWith results still trickling in early Tuesday, the Liberals had 157 seats \u2013 13 short of the 170 needed for a majority in the 338-seat House of Commons.\n\n\u201cTonight Canadians rejected division and negativity. They rejected cuts and austerity. They elected a progressive agenda and strong action on climate change,\u201d Trudeau said early Tuesday.\n\nHis address to supporters came, unusually, as his Conservative rival, Andrew Scheer, had just begun speaking to his own supporters, forcing networks to tear away from Scheer\u2019s speech. But the prime minister struck a conciliatory note: \u201cTo those who did not vote for us, know that we will work every single day for you, we will govern for everyone,\u201d Trudeau said.\n\nThe Canadian vote came down to what was essentially a choice between the handsome and charismatic Trudeau and Scheer, the Conservatives\u2019 unassuming leader who was seen as the perfect antidote to Trudeau\u2019s flash and celebrity.\n\nTrudeau reasserted liberalism in 2015 after almost 10 years of Conservative Party government in Canada, but scandals combined with high expectations damaged his prospects.\n\nPerhaps sensing Trudeau was in trouble, Barack Obama made an unprecedented endorsement by a former American president in urging Canadians to re-elect Trudeau and saying the world needs his progressive leadership now.\n\nTrudeau, son of the liberal icon and late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, is one of the few remaining progressive world leaders in the Trump era and even appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine under the headline \u201cWhy Can\u2019t He Be Our President?\u201d\n\nScheer, 40, is a career politician who was seen as a possible antidote to Trudeau\u2019s flash. But Bothwell said late Monday that he expected Scheer to resign.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d Bothwell said. \u201cHe ran a really dirty campaign. There is nothing to be proud of on his side. He had the opportunity and blew it.\u201d\n\nAmong other things, Scheer called Trudeau a phony who couldn\u2019t even remember how many times he had worn blackface.\n\nIn his concession speech, Scheer said the results showed Trudeau was much weakened since his 2015 election, when pundits had predicted the beginning of another Trudeau dynasty.\n\n\u201cTonight Conservatives have put Justin Trudeau on notice,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cAnd Mr. Trudeau when your government falls, Conservatives will be ready and we will win.\u201d\n\nTrudeau also was hurt by a scandal that erupted this year when his former attorney general said he pressured her to halt the prosecution of a Quebec company. Trudeau has said he was standing up for jobs, but the damage gave a boost to the Conservative Party.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s Liberals will likely rely on the New Democrats to form a new government and pass legislation. Opposition New Democrat leader Jagmeet Singh said early Tuesday he had congratulated Trudeau and vowed to play a constructive role in Parliament.\n\nWiseman, from the University of Toronto, said Monday\u2019s results left the Conservatives deeply disappointed.\n\n\u201cThey had an opportunity here to win,\u201d he said.\n\nCongratulations to @JustinTrudeau on a wonderful and hard fought victory. Canada is well served. I look forward to working with you toward the betterment of both of our countries! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2019\n\nScheer had promised to end a national carbon tax and cut government spending, including foreign aid, by 25%.\n\nTrudeau embraced immigration at a time when the U.S. and other countries are closing their doors, and he legalized cannabis nationwide.\n\nHis efforts to strike a balance on the environment and the economy have been criticized by both the right and left. He brought in a carbon tax to fight climate change but rescued a stalled pipeline expansion project to get Alberta\u2019s oil to international markets.\n\nHis also negotiated a new free trade deal for Canada with the U.S. and Mexico amid threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to scrap it.\n\nTrump, who has clashed with Trudeau over trade, tweeted his congratulations early Tuesday, saying, \u201cCanada is well served.\u201d\n\nPat Gill, a Vancouver retiree, said she voted for Trudeau.\n\n\u201cI think people know he\u2019s made some mistakes,\u201d said Gill, who is 74. \u201cI\u2019m hoping he\u2019s learned in the last four years. I still think he\u2019s our best bet.\u201d\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nAssociated Press writer Jim Morris in Vancouver, British Columbia, contributed to this report.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/10/21/justin-trudeau-liberals-win-canada-parliamentary-elections/4060032002/", "description": "Trudeau\u2019s Liberal party took the most seats in Parliament, giving it the best chance to form a government.
