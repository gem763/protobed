It\u2019s good for him and good for the team,\u201d team mate Idrissa Gueye said.\n\nNeymar, who angered the PSG fans by saying his best memory as a footballer was PSG\u2019s humiliating 6-1 defeat by Barca at the Camp Nou in the Champions League in 2017, was booed by part of the crowd in the first half as he put on a decent performance.\n\nHe capped his return with a goal that did not mask PSG\u2019s collective mediocrity.\n\nNew keeper Keylor Navas made a couple of brilliant saves as the visitors threatened on a few occasions while Mauro Icardi was toothless after coming on as a second-half substitute.\n\nThe Argentine striker, however, will be needed against Real on Wednesday in the absence of Neymar and the injured Kylian Mbappe.\n\nThe French international was sorely missed, just like Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani who may come back for the Real clash.\n\nStrasbourg had the first clear chance when Navas stretched to tip away Ludovic Ajorque\u2019s sudden strike in the 18th minute and PSG did not muster a single shot on target in the first half, struggling to unsettle a compact defence.\n\nThe hosts stepped up a gear in the closing stages, with Neymar scoring his 21st goal in 20 Ligue 1 games at the Parc des Princes.\n\nHe netted again two minutes later, only for the goal to be ruled out for an offside position.", "description": "Neymar scored a spectacular last-gasp goal for Paris St Germain that was greeted with more cheers than boos in a 1-0 Ligue 1 win over Racing Strasbourg on Saturday on his first appearance of the season following a failed transfer to Barcelona.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429853831&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8D0O1", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
