If you are not ready, don't come to the EFF. We've now taken a decision to fight Pravin and therefore you must know Pravin is going to fight dirty\u2026There will be casualties. There can even be a loss of life. If you are not ready for that, stand aside. I'm not scared. I'm ready. I'm prepared to confront them one by one.\"\n\nGordhan's counsel submitted that the above statement was a mechanism to create polarisation within society.\n\n\"Polarisation and dehumanisation through words are the first stage and precursor to the violence which follows. The 'them' becomes an acceptable target of violence once dehumanised.\n\n\"This is the antithesis of the inclusive, non-racist South Africa envisaged in the Constitution,\" Maenetje argued.\n\nMalema, in his statement, also said: \"Pravin is a cabal that belongs to the UDF and destroyed all good African comrades\u2026he's no good this guy. He has destroyed Peter Mokaba, he has destroyed Winnie Mandela, he has destroyed everyone else that stood for the truth against the apartheid regime. His shenanigans are not new\".\n\nMaenetje submitted that this statement was \"hurtful and directly attacks Gordhan's social origin and conscience\".\n\n\"The thrust of the statement extends to the claim that [Minister] Gordhan 'hates Africans' and that he seeks to destroy them. Worse, the claim is that this is a deliberate choice over many years,\" Maenetje said.\n\nThe matter continues.", "description": "EFF leader Julius Malema's scathing attack on Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan meets the relevant requirements - under the Equality Act - that constitute hate speech, the Equality Court has heard.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7516/27f4d40c846a445c9ab549390765a5c7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
