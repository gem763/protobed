It shows less respect for the people, you know?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Braves responded at the time by issuing a statement in which they said they \u201cappreciate and take seriously\u201d Helsley\u2019s concerns and have \u201cworked to honor and respect the Native American community through the years.\u201d\n\nShortly before Wednesday\u2019s game began, the Braves said in a statement, \u201cOut of respect for the concerns expressed by Mr. Helsley, we will take several efforts to reduce the Tomahawk Chop during our in-ballpark presentation today.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to shelving the foam tomahawks, the team said it would not be \u201cplaying the accompanying music or using Chop-related graphics when Mr. Helsley is in the game.\"\n\n\u201cAs stated earlier, we will continue to evaluate how we activate elements of our brand, as well as the overall in-game experience,\u201d the Braves said. \u201cWe look forward to a continued dialogue with those in the Native American community after the postseason concludes.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs Game 5 progressed and with Helsley in the Cardinals\u2019 bullpen, Braves fans continued to use the chant \u2014 with the team playing accompanying music \u2014 along with the traditional arm gesture mimicking a chopping motion. They have done so since the early 1990s, when they borrowed the rallying cry from fans of the Florida State Seminoles.\n\nAD\n\nAtlanta still doing the racist Tomahawk Chop chant lol pic.twitter.com/AoohFGLJBl \u2014 Jimmy H. (@HopHeadJim) October 9, 2019\n\nMLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in February that the Braves \u201chave taken steps to take out the tomahawk chop,\u201d but the team continued to distribute foam tomahawks, including for the home opener in April. In addition, the team has used the slogan \u201cChop on\u201d as a hashtag on social media.\n\nThe Braves phased out a longtime mascot, Chief Noc-a-homa, in 1986. Manfred has played a role in encouraging the Cleveland Indians to discontinue this season use of imagery of Chief Wahoo, a logo featuring a cartoonishly grinning Native American man.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a misrepresentation of the Cherokee people or Native Americans in general,\u201d Helsley said Friday to the St. Louis Times-Dispatch. \u201cJust depicts them in this kind of caveman-type people way who aren\u2019t intellectual. They are a lot more than that. It\u2019s not me being offended by the whole mascot thing. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s about the misconception of us, the Native Americans, and it devalues us and how we\u2019re perceived in that way, or used as mascots. The Redskins and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI feel like there are a lot of other things they could use as mascots,\u201d he added. \u201cUsing our heritage as a mascot \u2014 it isn\u2019t the best thing. There have been schools who in the past 20, 30 years have changed their mascots. I don\u2019t see why professional teams are so far behind on that.\u201d\n\nTold before Game 5 of the Braves\u2019 efforts to address his concerns, Helsley said to ESPN, \u201cI think they\u2019re taking the right steps. \u2026 Fans might not like it, but maybe they can reflect back on it and see it was a good move.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Reliever Ryan Helsley, a member of the Cherokee Nation, had called the tomahawk chop and accompanying chant by Braves fans 'disrespectful.'", "authors": ["Des Bieler", "Sports Reporter Covering National Topics", "Including Fantasy Football", "As Well As Supporting Coverage Of D.C.-Area Teams"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0Rdbp8RrHrWQAan9GNoKIHrfLB0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WU2YE6URONFLPJT3DWT4CZDJWI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
