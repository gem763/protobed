Fry is sitting in a cluttered office negotiating the contract of potential new striker Miguel De Souza, repeatedly swatting away his agent\u2019s demands with: \u201cYou ain\u2019t gonna get that, fuckin\u2019 hell!\u201d As the talks are finally concluded, Fry shakes the player by the hand, smashes a gavel on his desk, looks down at himself and shouts: \u201cSold to the fat bastard in the blue blazer!\u201d before laughing maniacally.\n\nYou suspect that, for better or worse, managers like Barry Fry are few and far between in football these days. The recent documentary All or Nothing: Manchester City revealed a slightly more considered approach \u2013 City\u2019s executives are sitting in a swish suite discussing transfers and although their target list is blurred out, with hindsight it is easy to trace the shape of the letters spelling out the top name in the summer of 2017: Aymeric Laporte. With clinical efficiency, City signed their first choice and he played a key role in their 100-point season. Few clubs have the money to be as decisive, but across football Fry\u2019s method of engaging in enthusiastic discourse has been replaced by something more subtle, and more precise.\n\nThe principals of valuing a footballer haven\u2019t really changed over the past few decades. We already know the broad markers: performance, experience, age, contract duration. It\u2019s just that now every touch of every ball in every major league is monitored, and it means that value is something fluid which can shift in an instant.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

What looked like promising performances to the eye had translated to a raft of key passes and dribbles in the complex algorithm of the CIES Football Observatory in Geneva.\n\n\u201cHis performance statistics showed after only two games that he was clearly a very talented player,\u201d says Dr Raffaele Poli, the organisation\u2019s head. Not only was McNeil showing high performance metrics but he was young and contracted to a Premier League club; from almost nothing he was valued as a multi-million pound asset.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Getty\n\nDr Poli says game time at each level of the game is a crucial and telling variable \u2013 minutes translate to experience and also tend to indicate performance \u2013 but he believes CIES are nearing the limit of their modelling accuracy. The transfer of Diego Costa from Chelsea to Atletico Madrid was impossible to model, he explains, distorted by Costa\u2019s very public fallout with Chelsea manager Antonio Conte, while CIES pitched Tyrone Ming\u2019s market price far below the \u00a325m Aston Villa paid Bournemouth for the defender whose career has been stalled by injury. \u201cWe are at around an 86% correlation [with actual transfer prices], and I think we are near the limit. If you try to do a model to correct Mings, it will be wrong for many more players.\u201d\n\nCIES often mediate between during disputed negotiations, while several consultancies have established themselves as advisors on transfer recruitment with a raft of tools to disseminate big data. One such consultancy which works with Premier League boardrooms, 21st Club, predominantly uses two methods for valuing players: the first is to benchmark a transfer target against not just one or two players that spring to mind but a deep pool of 15-20 comparables to gauge how likely the transfer is to be a success; the second is to pitch the player\u2019s value in the context of the buying club\u2019s financial muscle.\n\nAs Omar Chaudhuri, 21st Club\u2019s head of intelligence, explains: \u201cYou can look at Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona and see that his transfer fee was roughly 18% of Barcelona\u2019s revenue. What you find is that, let\u2019s take Everton buying Gylfi Sigurdsson \u2013 who is almost as important to Everton as Coutinho was expected to be for Barcelona \u2013 his fee is in a similar sort of range, around 18-20% of Everton\u2019s revenue. So you get this rate card depending on the importance of players within an individual team. A lot of the advice we give clubs is \u2018OK, if you\u2019re going to spend 10% of revenues, this is the kind of impact you should expect the player to have on your team\u2019.\u201d\n\nPart of the advisory role is to find the cheat codes that will unlock value and potential upside, like ignoring the stigma around relegated players, something Liverpool have used to great effect in the signings of Andrew Robertson, Georginio Wijnaldum and Xherdan Shaqiri. \u201cRelegated players are usually disregarded by mid-table Premier League clubs,\u201d says Chaudhuri. \u201cBut actually if you look at players that have been signed from relegated teams, they\u2019ve disproportionately grown in value over the past few years.\u201d\n\nChaudhuri also wants to break the assumption that experience in one of Europe\u2019s other big-five leagues equips players for Premier League football. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve found is it\u2019s not actually about the league but about the team you\u2019re recruiting from. So Benfica\u2019s a good example: the Portuguese league is not very good at all, but players within Benfica are as likely to succeed in the Premier League, if not more likely, than a player from say Wolfsburg, for example, despite them playing in Germany.\u201d\n\nThe scientification of the market has emboldened clubs at the top end to risk more on young potential, particularly those with the financial reserves to absorb an expensive mistake. The knock-on effect is that we\u2019ve seen clubs like Borussia Dortmund and Monaco able to make a business model out of moulding young players and selling them up the food chain for exorbitant fees before regenerating (with mixed success), while to a lesser extent Southampton have upcycled players in England. In Europe, Ousmane Dembele is the archetypical example, bought by Dortmund for \u00a313m and sold to Barcelona 12 months later for \u00a3112m.\n\nThis race to buy young talent has put a premium on potential, and it has skewed the market. \u201cIf you look across the board, the price of players under 21 is rising much more quickly than the price of 23 to 26-year-olds,\u201d says Chaudhuri. \u2018That\u2019s indicative of clubs trying to sign these gems who could potentially pay for the academy over the coming years.\u201d The money pouring in from TV revenues is the biggest driver of these shifting trends, and any trickle-down effect is minimal \u2013 66% of the big-five leagues\u2019 transfer spending stays in those leagues. It means lower down the pyramid, clubs are embracing the more analytical age not because they can afford to, but because they can no longer afford to get transfers wrong.\n\nAfter 12 years spent away, spiralling down into non-league, Luton Town returned to the Championship this season with what has been voted the worst Football League ground in the country. Luton are having to play catch-up; a new shiny stadium has planning permission to replace the crumbling Kenilworth Road, where away supporters climb up rusty stairs hanging over the neighbour\u2019s back gardens, while behind the scenes the club have been overhauling some of their more antiquated methods.\n\n\u201cWe have an analysis department which we\u2019ve built up over the past six months,\u201d says Mick Harford, the former Luton and England striker who is now the club\u2019s head of recruitment. \u201cWe fish in different waters now we are in the Championship. There are certain areas of the world we have to go for value for money. We have to compete differently. If we start going to Italy and Spain we can\u2019t afford the players. It\u2019s a difficult job trying to find out a players levels but that\u2019s why we have analysts.\u201d\n\nBut ultimately there is only so much the numbers can reveal about a player\u2019s character, their ability to adapt to new surroundings, or their relationship with the manager. There continues to be costly mistakes and the numbers can only minimise the risk, not erase it entirely. When the analysis is over, whether at Peterborough or Manchester City or Luton Town, valuing a footballer will always require a little feel. \u201cWe watch him, discuss it and put a valuation on him,\u201d says Harford. \u201cIt\u2019s based on our good feeling and what we think he\u2019s worth. It\u2019s based on what we think his value to this football club is.\u201d", "description": "There is a brilliant scene in the 1997 tragi-comic documentary There\u2019s only one Barry Fry, a fly-on-the-wall chronicle of his disastrous time in charge of Peterborough Football Club, which reveals a bygone age when the wheeler-dealer manager was still a thing.", "authors": ["Lawrence Ostlere"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/13/10/1159686961.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
