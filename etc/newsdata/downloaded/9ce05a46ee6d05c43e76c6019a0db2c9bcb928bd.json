Mr. Trump gave clear missions to accomplish and raised the morale of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines. He increased combat readiness and cancelled many detrimental rules of engagement and politically correct regulations. He saved the military from unilateral disarmament and engaged the enemies of freedom and America, ensuring that we would win. Now it is wrong for sore losers and leftist American generals to write articles and books complaining about alleged politicization by Mr. Trump, who fixed the true politicization and has made the military great again.\n\nLT.
