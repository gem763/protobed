The government also strengthened efforts to disinfect farms and transport vehicles and ordered a 48-hour standstill on all pig farms, slaughterhouses and feed factories across the country to prevent the spread of the disease, which threatens a massive industry that involves 6,000 farms raising more than 11 million pigs.\n\nAfrican swine fever has decimated pig herds in China and other Asian countries before reaching the Koreas. It is harmless to people but for pigs is highly contagious and fatal. There is no known cure.\n\n\u201cWe will invest maximum effort to prevent the disease from spreading \u2026 we believe the first week (following the outbreak) would be most dangerous,\u201d considering incubation periods, Kim said during a news conference in Sejong City.\n\n\u201cWe will quickly complete monitoring inspections at the 6,300 farms (nationwide) \u2026 checking each pig to see whether it has fever or not and testing on even the slightest of symptoms,\u201d he said.\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in called for fast and stern quarantine measures to prevent the disease from wreaking havoc on the pork industry, the presidential Blue House said.\n\nThe outbreak in South Korea comes despite months of heightened monitoring efforts at border area farms after the disease spread to North Korea. In May, the North told the World Organization for Animal Health, or OIE, that 77 of the 99 pigs at a cooperative farm near its border with China died of the disease and the remaining 22 pigs were culled.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s agriculture ministry said investigators were sent to the farm to trace the source of the outbreak and it wasn\u2019t immediately clear if the disease would have crossed from North Korea. The ministry said in June that blood tests of pigs from some 340 farms near the border with the North came back negative.\n\nNorth Korea has scaled back cooperation with South Korea after a summit between leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump collapsed in February, and it has ignored repeated South Korean calls for joint efforts to stem the spread of the disease.\n\nSouth Korea placed hundreds of fences and traps around border area farms to prevent pigs from being infected by wild boars that roam in and out of North Korea. South Korea\u2019s military, which had monitored the movement of wild boars through heat sensors installed along the border, said it would be difficult for wild boars to cross over barbed wire fences in the mine-scattered border zone. But government officials have said the animals could possibly swim across rivers.\n\nKim, the South Korean agricultural minister, said the Paju farm hit by the disease was about 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) away from a river that runs across the border. But it is a sealed indoor facility with no windows and is surrounded by fences to fend off wild boars. The farm\u2019s owner and four Nepalese workers said they hadn\u2019t recently traveled outside of South Korea, Kim said.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to immediately confirm the infection route of the disease,\u201d Kim said. \u201cWe are trying to identify the cause as soon as possible because that would be crucial for preventing the disease from spreading.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "South Korea is culling thousands of pigs after confirming African swine fever at a farm near its border with North Korea, which had an outbreak in May.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kim Tong-Hyung"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/south_korea_swine_fever_21318_c0-167-4000-2499_s1770x1032.jpg?0ff70703b128ca503aced402a7d61935364c4e5a", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
