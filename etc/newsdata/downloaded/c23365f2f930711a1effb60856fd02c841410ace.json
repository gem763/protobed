The issue could come up at talks between the CIA\u2019s acting director, Michael Morell, and his Pakistani counterpart, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, who is due to arrive in Washington today.\n\nA senior U.S. official said the vaccine campaign was conducted by medical professionals and should not be construed as a \u201cfake public health effort.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople need to put this into some perspective,\u201d said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. \u201cThe vaccination campaign was part of the hunt for the world\u2019s top terrorist, and nothing else. If the United States hadn\u2019t shown this kind of creativity, people would be scratching their heads asking why it hadn\u2019t used all tools at its disposal to find bin Laden.\u201d\n\nThe campaign was conducted shortly before the May 1 raid on bin Laden\u2019s compound. The official declined to say whether DNA from bin Laden\u2019s relatives was collected.\n\nOfficials have previously said, however, that they used DNA analysis to confirm bin Laden\u2019s identify after he was killed. In doing so, they used samples taken from known relatives.\n\nThe tests concluded with near-perfect certainty that the man killed at the Pakistani compound was the al-Qaeda leader. The chance of a false positive from the DNA testing, an intelligence official said, was \u201capproximately one in 11.8 quadrillion.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press, meanwhile, has reported from Islamabad that Pakistani officials and international health organizations are concerned that the CIA-organized effort could harm immunization programs in the country, where public skepticism of vaccinations have long been an obstacle to eradication of the polio.", "description": "The clandestine effort was aimed at obtaining DNA of Osama bin Laden\u2019s relatives.", "authors": ["Jason Ukman", "Greg Miller", "July"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "published_at": "2011-07-13"}
