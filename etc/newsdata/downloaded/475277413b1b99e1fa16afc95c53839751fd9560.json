The man began to show signs of heat exhaustion while working in the attic of a modest home in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Less than an hour later, he collapsed and died.\n\nThe company was fined a few thousand dollars because it did not \u201cfurnish employment and a place of employment which were free from recognized hazards.\u201d\n\nOr take the watermelon picker in Five Points, California, who collapsed on the way to his vehicle after a six-hour shift in temperatures above 100 Fahrenheit. No one on the team got a break that day, according to a colleague, despite state labor laws. When the man was pronounced dead at he hospital, his body temperature was 109 Fahrenheit. The company was fined $25,750.\n\nThese are just two examples of what outdoor workers face when temperatures rise.\n\nThe heat wave gripping much of the country has already been blamed for six deaths. As global temperatures continue to rise and heat waves become more common and extreme, it is the poor, the elderly, laborers, and people with medical conditions who will be at the greatest risk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople over 65 are among those with the greatest risk of heat-related deaths, followed by men who work in outdoor occupations, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\u201cAny person can suffer from heat stress, regardless of age, sex, or health status,\u201d the agency wrote in a 2016 report on heat-related illness. \u201cOlder adults and children, however, have a higher-than-average risk of becoming ill due to exposure to extreme heat. People working outdoors, the socially isolated and economically disadvantaged, those with chronic illnesses, and some communities of color are also especially vulnerable to heat.\u201d\n\nWhen a massive heat wave struck Chicago in July 1995, the city was ill prepared to deal with the crisis. That lack of preparation had deadly consequences: 739 people died, including Valerie Brown\u2019s grandmother, Alberta.\n\n\u201cThey put my grandma\u2019s body in a refrigerated truck,\u201d Brown told NBC News. \u201cThere is no death certificate. They just took her body away and put her in a mass grave.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the elderly who were hit hardest by the 1995 heat wave in Chicago, according to Judith Helfand, who directed a new documentary about the heat wave, Cooked: Survival by Zip Code.\n\n\u201cThe people who died in 1995 were poor, and disproportionately black,\u201d Helfand told NBC News.\n\n\u201cRacism kills people,\u201d she added.\n\nResearch has shown that climate change and the resulting heat waves will hit large urban areas particularly hard, in part because the concrete, brick, steel, and glass these cities are built from creates \u201cheat islands\u201d that trap heat during the day then slowly release it overnight, preventing the city from cooling down once the sun sets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat creates a dangerous situation for people like construction workers, the elderly, the poor, minorities, and the homeless, who tend to be concentrated in cities and may not have the resources to stay in air-conditioned buildings when temperatures soar.\n\nJust three states have regulations in place to protect outdoor workers in extreme heat. The advocacy group Public Citizen launched a campaign last year to get the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to put tighter rules in place to protect workers during heat waves.\n\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump has nominated Eugene Scalia \u2014 son of late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and a lifelong opponent of labor regulations \u2014 to head the Department of Labor, which oversees OSHA.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1162996603.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1"}
