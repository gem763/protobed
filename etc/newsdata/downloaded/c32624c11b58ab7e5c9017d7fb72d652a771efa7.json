Get over it\u2019\n\nDonald Trump instructed US diplomats to go through his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to make the Ukrainian president\u2019s access to the White House dependent on launching investigations into Trump\u2019s political opponents, the US ambassador to the EU has testified.\n\nIn his opening statement to Congress on Thursday, Gordon Sondland, a wealthy hotelier and Trump donor, sought to distance himself from the president, saying he had been \u201cdisappointed\u201d Trump had chosen to conduct an important strategic relationship through his lawyer.\n\nRefuse, block, stonewall \u2013 but Trump's strategy leaves little margin for error Read more\n\nBut Sondland insisted he only realised later that the aim of the investigations Trump was demanding was to target the Democratic party and a potential rival for the presidency in 2020, Joe Biden.\n\nHe claimed, for example, he was not aware at the time of his negotiations with Ukraine that Burisma, an energy company Giuliani specifically named, had employed Hunter Biden, the former vice-president\u2019s son.\n\nThe White House denounced the impeachment hearings as a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d on Thursday, but it admitted that military aid to Ukraine was suspended in part because Trump wanted to investigate a far-right conspiracy theory that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) internet server had been located in Ukraine to shield it from scrutiny, and that Russia had been framed for interfering in the 2016 election.\n\nTom Bossert, who served as Trump\u2019s first homeland security adviser, said last month that he had told the president the theory was groundless.\n\nAsked if the administration had offered Ukraine a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d, the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, replied: \u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy \u2026 I have news for everybody. Get over it. There is going to be political influence in foreign policy. Elections have consequences.\u201d\n\nMulvaney\u2019s comments appeared to reflect a change in White House tactics. The administration is no longer denying there was a political trade-off in relations with Kyiv, after multiple officials have testified that there was.\n\nSondland is the sixth US official to give evidence at impeachment hearings, and all the more significant because he was a Trump loyalist who was at the centre of deliberations on how to deal with Ukraine. His statement reflects a defection from Trump\u2019s ranks and a further sign that the president\u2019s efforts to gag public servants have failed.\n\nSondland had first been due to give testimony on 8 October but was blocked from appearing by the Trump administration. After the House committees issued a subpoena, Sondland defied state department orders, saying he was keen to testify.\n\nThe ambassador to the EU testified that Trump personally directed the drive to make the investigation a condition for a phone call from Trump to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and a White House visit for the new Ukrainian president. It is a significant point in the impeachment proceedings being held by three House committees, which are looking for evidence Trump abused his office for political gain.\n\nThe key event in Sondland\u2019s narrative is a 23 May White House meeting with Trump attended by Sondland, the former Ukraine special envoy Kurt Volker and the energy secretary, Rick Perry. The three had just returned from Zelenskiy\u2019s inauguration and were trying to persuade Trump to have a telephone conversation with his new Ukrainian counterpart and invite him to the White House, as a mark of US support.\n\n\u201cHowever, President Trump was skeptical that Ukraine was serious about reforms and anti-corruption, and he directed those of us present at the meeting to talk to Mr Giuliani, his personal attorney, about his concerns,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cIt was apparent to all of us that the key to changing the president\u2019s mind on Ukraine was Mr Giuliani.\n\n'He tried to have his cake and eat it': how Trump's Ukraine envoy lost his big gamble Read more\n\n\u201cIndeed, Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker and I were disappointed by our 23 May 2019 White House debriefing,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cWe strongly believed that a call and White House meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelenskiy was important and that these should be scheduled promptly and without any preconditions.\n\n\u201cWe were also disappointed by the president\u2019s direction that we involve Mr Giuliani,\u201d Sondland added. \u201cOur view was that the men and women of the state department, not the president\u2019s personal lawyer, should take responsibility for all aspects of US foreign policy towards Ukraine.\n\n\u201cHowever, based on the president\u2019s direction, we were faced with a choice,\u201d Sondland argued. The choice was between abandoning their efforts to strengthen US-Ukrainian ties, \u201cor we could do as President Trump directed\u201d.\n\nBut the ambassador insisted: \u201cI did not understand, until much later, that Mr Giuliani\u2019s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice-President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the president\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign.\u201d\n\nWhen the diplomats talked to Giuliani, the lawyer said \u201cthe two anticorruption investigatory topics of importance for the president\u201d were the allegation about the DNC server\u2019s location and Burisma\u2019s activities.\n\nSondland added: \u201c[M]y understanding was that the president directed Mr Giuliani\u2019s participation, that Mr Giuliani was expressing the concerns of the president.\u201d\n\nHe also claimed he was not aware at the time that $400m in US military aid had been withheld from Ukraine to add to the pressure on Zelenskiy.\n\nSondland stated that such actions would be wrong but insisted he did not participate in them.", "description": "Meanwhile, White House chief of staff undercuts Trump\u2019s denials of quid pro quo: \u2018We do that all the time.
