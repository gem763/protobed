Foster, president of Feminists for Life, told the crowded room. \u201cThe same women who fought for the slaves to be freed also fought for our children to be here and mothers to be supported.\u201d\n\nGloria Purvis, host of the TV series \u201cAuthentically Free at Last\u201d on the EWTN Catholic network, said she is furious over how \u201cthe pro-choice movement has pimped the image of the African American woman. It\u2019s really just a mask for unjust discrimination.\u201d\n\nThe 47th annual March for Life will be held Jan. 24 in the nation\u2019s capital. It protests the Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion.\n\nJeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund, told supporters that a conference linked to the march will feature a slate of speakers who tie abortion restrictions to women\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cCourageous suffragists like Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton who fought for women\u2019s right to vote also opposed abortion,\u201d Ms. Mancini said in a statement. \u201cPro-lifers should be inspired by the early suffragists, who understood the true dignity of women and that every person, born and unborn, deserves equal rights and protections under the law.\u201d\n\nThe annual march comes as the conservative-majority Supreme Court hears abortion-related cases. The court will consider the constitutionality of a Louisiana law that requires abortion doctors to maintain admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the women\u2019s clinic. Three years ago, a 5-4 liberal-majority court struck down a similar law in Texas.\n\nThe court also will review an Indiana law requiring an ultrasound at least 18 hours before an abortion and a Chicago ordinance bars protesters from coming within eight feet of anyone entering or exiting an abortion clinic.\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s announcement, Victoria Cobb, president of The Family Foundation of Virginia, criticized the Equal Rights Amendment, a proposal that has gained support since its inception in the 1980s and that Virginia\u2019s legislature likely would approve if Democrats take control in November.\n\nThe proposed amendment promises equal rights to all Americans regardless of sex, including access to health care, housing and employment. But Ms. Cobb cited opinion research suggesting that support for the ERA in Virginia drops when survey-takers are informed the amendment would write abortion protections into the Constitution.\n\n\u201c\u2018Pro-woman.\u2019 Have we ever stopped to think what this claim is?\u201d she said. \u201cWhen a woman gets pregnant, the people who are saying she must take the life of her child in order to continue school or have a thriving career are the people who are supposed to be on the side of pro-woman.\u201d\n\nThe pro-choice group Reproaction criticized the March for Life theme in a tweet: \u201cThere is absolutely nothing \u2018pro-woman\u2019 about a movement that restricts bodily autonomy and refuses to #StopProsecutingAbortion.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
