Working largely through Medicaid and North Carolina\u2019s dominant private health insurer, the state is also addressing social and economic drivers of poor health, like homelessness. Here\u2019s how that\u2019s working in practice for three providers: an urban safety net hospital, a small-town family doctor and a community clinic.\n\nThe Urban Safety Net\n\nThere\u2019s probably no better place to see the public-private synergy in North Carolina\u2019s health care system than WakeMed, a public safety net hospital and health system in the Raleigh area. And there\u2019s probably no better personal embodiment of it than Brian Klausner.\n\nA primary care physician who came to WakeMed in 2011 from the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, Klausner spends much of his time treating homeless people with multiple, chronic mental and physical illnesses. He is also medical director of WakeMed Key Community Care, a physician practice that\u2019s known as an accountable care organization \u2013 a health care model created under Obamacare (and maintained under the Trump administration) that seeks to address the overall health of a patient population while restraining costs.\n\nCombined, those perches give Klausner a unique take on how data-driven metrics, new financial incentives \u2013 and unintended consequences, that boogeyman of health innovation \u2013 play out in patients\u2019 lives.\n\nKlausner divides his time between the hospital and the community, including the streets. A lodestar is a facility for the homeless called Oak City Cares, a marvel of a place that includes medical care (including behavioral health, in person and, soon, via telemedicine), showers and laundry, community rooms, a supervised child center where kids play while their parents avail themselves of a cornucopia of health and social resources. Having them all under one roof means easy coordination for the service providers, one-stop shopping for the client. And it\u2019s all done with dignity. The people who line up outside when Oak City opens at 9 each morning may be ragged, they may have slept in a car, but they are treated as guests.\n\n\u201cWe have a check-in desk \u2013 like a swanky hotel,\u201d said Kathy Johnson, Oak City\u2019s executive director. There\u2019s free coffee in the cafe, computers for job searches, locked cellphone chargers. Some people find their way here on their own; outreach teams who slowly build trust bring others along.\n\nThe homeless population is a major driver of health care costs in many regions, and Raleigh is no exception. To improve the health of homeless individuals and families, relationship-building is key, particularly for people with mental illnesses who are distrustful of doctors and medications. \u201cThere are totally disconnected patients, they aren\u2019t burning up [money] in the [emergency department]. They learned a long time ago to stay away from people, to stay in the woods,\u201d said Nerissa Price, the psychiatrist at Oak City. \u201cBeing in the system long enough wears you out,\u201d she added. \u201cThis will be so much simpler.\u201d\n\nMark Rogowski, 59, might turn out to be one of Klausner turnaround stories. Only recently did Rogowski qualify for disability under Medicaid -- not because of his bipolar disorder, or his impaired mobility from a bum knee, sciatica and neuropathy, but because four heart attacks have finally caused so much damage that after nearly a decade on the streets, he\u2019ll get health coverage and a monthly check. WakeMed will no longer have to eat all the costs every time the one-time restaurant line cook walks through its doors.\n\nKlausner\u2019s outreach teams keep tabs on Rogowski but sometimes Klausner visits himself. He showed up one summer day, toting a carryout lunch with Rogowski\u2019s favorites from a nearly Latino lunch counter. Rogowski\u2019s world is contained; he stays near one intersection, panhandling under a tree by a Wendy\u2019s, sleeping in his old car. When he\u2019s very sick, he trusts Klausner enough to come in.\n\nHis first disability check was due in a month; One minute he\u2019s talking about renting a little place up the road from \u201chis\u201d corner. Another, he\u2019s talking about visiting his estranged ex-wife and adult son and taking a long, slow hike to Alaska, a tall order for anyone in Rogowski\u2019s condition, but something to dream about. He insists that he likes the \u201cfreedom\u201d of being solitary and homeless; only that first week long ago was frightening. He\u2019s got it all figured out, now. That pile of discarded pizza boxes beneath his car? It\u2019s not garbage, he says, but a clever lure to keep ants and pests underneath his car, not inside it.\n\nFor the health care system, someone like Rogowski can be a fiscal sinkhole \u2014 a patient who is complicated and broke, and whose social needs exacerbate and sometimes overwhelm his medical needs, which are costly. At the forefront of his hospital\u2019s value-push and eager for more flexibility in Medicaid spending, Klausner makes both an economic and a moral case for preventive care and for addressing socioeconomic factors. Buy insulin now or pay for amputation later. House a family or pay for the lifelong health consequences of childhood adversity and toxic stress.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the type of medicine we should be practicing,\u201d Klausner said. \u201cKeep them out of the hospital if you can. And if you can\u2019t, at least keep them out of the ICU \u2013 or jail.\u201d\n\nThe Family Doctor\n\nKaren Smith may be the sole physician in her rural family medicine practice in Raeford, but her office includes several other providers, including nurse practitioners, social workers, physician assistants, a population health administrator, plus a rotating group of students and trainees. Smith came to Duke from suburban Maryland nearly 40 years ago. After med school in Philadelphia, and residency at Duke, she spent three years in Hoke County in a med school loan forgiveness program. Twenty-four years later, she\u2019s still here. In 2017, the American Academy of Family Physicians named her its physician of the year for her relentless innovation in a practice that combines high tech and high touch in a community with high needs.\n\nIn a story repeated all across rural America, Smith used to be one of four family physicians around here; two retired, one left. Smith has had trouble recruiting another primary care doctor to join her in this remote town that grew up around a turn-of-the-century turpentine plant and now has fewer than 5,000 people, many of them poor.\n\nA woman who speaks freely of her deep faith and sense of mission, Smith\u2019s both an old-fashioned family doctor, building multigenerational relationships with folks she sees around town at church and the Walmart, and a national leader in value-based care. She introduced electronic health records to her remote little practice in 2003, almost unheard of then. She\u2019s one of the first rural doctors to introduce electronic check-in kiosks; now, she\u2019s venturing into telemedicine, particularly with substance abuse patients who are becoming an increasingly large share of her practice as she\u2019s the only doctor for miles around trained and licensed to provide medication-assisted opioid treatment. When most doctors were still resisting digitization, Smith was wrangling the data to eke out all the help she could get in delivering quality care to patients with little money and big needs.\n\nShe\u2019s seized on to every model, like medical homes, that boost value and enhance primary care. Now, through a venture run by Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina and Aledade, a Washington health tech firm, her practice is part of a physician-centric Accountable Care Organization. Still, she says, the needs are vast and underappreciated. \u201cWe\u2019re maxing out on efficiency,\u201d she said earlier this year, on the second story of her clinic, which has a kitchen and comfy living room that serves as a meeting area and hang-out space for her staff, her students and sometimes her family.\n\nHer patients are dealing with chronic diseases and ongoing challenges \u2013 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, heart disease, depression. Many struggle to keep a roof over their head, food in their bellies, a way to get around. Some have experienced domestic violence. How fast and eagerly kids snap up the healthy snacks in baskets downstairs tells Smith\u2019s team a lot about who may be going hungry. One night, she dealt with a sex trafficking case involving a 12-year-old; another day, the only way to get a family out of harms\u2019 way was to ask her husband to pick them up. About a third of her patients get Medicaid; many more would gain coverage if the Legislature finally approved expansion.\n\nThe Community Clinic\n\nIn Carolina\u2019s Piedmont, Yanceyville is just 40 miles northeast of Greensboro, 42 northwest of Durham. But it\u2019s a different world. The ornate Caswell County Courthouse, completed in 1861, with its domed cupola and Romanesque arches, harkens back to an era when bright leaf tobacco (and later textiles) were king. That\u2019s gone; nothing has replaced it. Once the wealthiest county in the state, Caswell is now near rock bottom; its small commercial strip has a vacant, defeated air. People who are employed drive well beyond Yanceyville to a minimum wage job or service sector job -- until the car breaks down and they can\u2019t afford to fix it.\n\nIt\u2019s also the home of the Caswell Family Medical Center, which has seized on every tool it can to walk the value-based walk and improve the health of not only individual patients but its broader community. The Caswell clinic is what\u2019s known as an FQHC, a federally qualified health center. Pretty much everyone who walks in is low-income, though not all are uninsured partly because even without Medicaid expansion Obamacare boosted insurance coverage in North Carolina. Working with Blue Cross, the clinic has brought in data and dashboards for \u201cpopulation health,\u201d making it easier to track a patient due for a cancer screening, or immunizations, supporting prevention and chronic disease management. But coordination is hard when local people scatter for work across such a broad region.\n\n\u201cOur patients are all over the place,\u201d said Shannon Moretz, the clinic\u2019s director of strategic initiatives. Ten hospitals, two states, it\u2019s hard to keep track, hard to follow up, hard to coordinate, hard to address the social drivers. There aren\u2019t enough Caswell patients in any given hospital to make a dent in the bottom line, so unlike WakeMEd these hospitals have little incentive for them to step in big-time to help this small depressed community.\n\nCaswell Family routinely screens for social needs like transportation, housing and access to healthy food, said nurse Casey Moore. But it relies on a patchwork of services, churches, volunteers and philanthropies to fix things. For instance, the local summer lunch program for school kids, such as it is, is cobbled together by two retired kindergarten teachers, at least one of whom is in her 70s.\n\n\u201cThe rest of the free world is talking about opioids \u2013 but there wasn\u2019t even an AA meeting in this county,\u201d said the clinic\u2019s CEO, William Crumpton, who was a patient here as a child and returned midcareer to run this place (and help the community get two AA meetings started).\n\nHe and other staff at the Caswell clinic sees the state\u2019s \u201cHealthy Opportunity\u201d Medicaid program and its new online social service network on the horizon. But they fear they are too remote, the community too limited in resources and capacity to take part or benefit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not sure,\u201d Crumpton said, \u201cwe\u2019re ever going to see any of that money in Caswell.\u201d\n\nJoanne Kenen is POLITICO\u2019s executive editor for health care.", "description": "Three North Carolina health care providers describe how the state\u2019s reform efforts are affecting their practice and patients.", "authors": ["Joanne Kenen", "Jenny Hopkinson", "Arthur Allen", "Dan Diamond", "Darren Samuelsohn", "Michael Grunwald", "Megan Cassella", "Paul Demko", "Marianne Levine", "Nancy Scola"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
