That\u2019s about 129 a day.\n\nAmong them, in the last half year, were the suicides of two students who survived the 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, along with the father of a 6-year-old who had been killed during the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut.\n\nThe mother of one of the Douglas suicides, Sydney Aiello, said her daughter had suffered from survivor\u2019s guilt after 14 of her classmates (including her best friend) and three teachers died. Aiello had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nWhen I initially posted about \u00adAiello\u2019s death on Facebook, all I could allow myself to say was: \u201cHeartbreaking.\u201d But I know from the loss of friends to suicide that heartbreaking is just one of the many painful emotions unleashed. There\u2019s also grief and anger.\n\nNot to mention the inevitable, \u201cWhat if?\u201d\n\nToo many times, I\u2019ve found myself asking: Were there warning signs before the suicide? Could loved ones have done anything different? Most of all, how do we learn from this?\n\nFrankly, these are the questions I asked myself late last fall, after a friend took his own life.\n\nI\u2019d known James for nearly 15 years. We both suffered from depression; he more than I. We both had had suicidal thoughts; his more frequent and darker than mine. Last year, after the suicides of fashion designer Kate Spade and celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain, I wrote an article about having been suicidal twice in my life.\n\nI wasn\u2019t suicidal until suddenly, scarily, I was\n\nI was terrified to do so because of the stigma, but I was convinced by some friends that it might help others. After the article appeared, I felt naked and vulnerable, but over the next several months I saw the positive impact that my words had on others.\n\n\u201cThank you for raising your hand. Your decision to write about your own experiences . . . will no doubt give permission to many, many people to share their experiences and maybe even seek help. At the very least it will help them feel less alone,\u201d one reader wrote.\n\nI sent James my essay, and was glad that he told me he was feeling better than he had in a while. By contrast my own life was stormy, with waves of depression taller and rougher than I\u2019d experienced in quite some time. I felt a lifeline to James because he understood my world. I liked to think he felt the same.\n\nAnd then, the week before Christmas, James took his own life, leaving a wife, who loved him, extended family, and so many friends who cared deeply for him \u2014 including me.\n\nFor many of the years that I had known James, I\u2019d wondered how to help him, even though he was getting top-notch care. My answer: Be open about my own struggles. Initiate conversations. Listen. I knew that certain times of the year challenged him more \u2014 always the dark days leading up to the winter solstice, weeks that included his birthday.\n\nThis past year, I was distracted by my sister\u2019s cancer treatment. I don\u2019t blame myself for failing to be more closely in touch with James in December.\n\nThat\u2019s a lie. Of course I do.\n\nJames died one week after his birthday, four days before the winter solstice when the days would have started to be lengthen and brighten.\n\nWhat could I have done better? It\u2019s not an easy question to answer.\n\n\u201cThe typical risk factors for suicide (having depression, older age, alcohol abuse, etc.) are not very helpful at all in predicting suicide because most people with these risk factors will never be suicidal or commit suicide,\u201d says Richard A. Friedman, director of the psychopharmacology clinic at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York.\n\nIn the coverage of the two Parkland students\u2019 death by suicide, I\u2019d seen references to Columbia University\u2019s Lighthouse Project, which has a tag line of: \u201cIdentify risk. Prevent suicide.\u201d The website provides a few simple, but crucial, questions that can be asked by a spouse, a family member, a friend (even a teenager) to assess someone\u2019s risk of suicide.\n\nThey are challenging questions, because if answered honestly they may reveal the true depths of an individual\u2019s suffering and require calling 911 for immediate assistance.\n\nKelly Posner Gerstenhaber, a Columbia psychiatry professor and lead scientist of the Lighthouse Project, developed the short questionnaire, which the website claims has \u201can unprecedented amount of research [validating] the relevance and effectiveness of the questions,\u201d as a simple way to identify those at high risk for suicide.\n\nYou can\u2019t wait for those who are hurting to come forward on their own, she told me, and I was dumbfounded when she said that half of all people who take their lives see their primary care doctors the month before they die. Dumbfounded but also aware that my own primary care doctor is vigilant about my A1c level (a measure of diabetes) and an enzyme calledcreatine kinase (a sign of heart disease) but never asks about my mental health.\n\n\u201cWe need to ask about suicide the way we monitor blood pressure,\u201d Posner Gerstenhaber says. And then start immediate treatment, if someone is in danger.\n\nWhen I answered the Lighthouse questions, I was jolted by the potential gravity of my own responses (although I didn\u2019t fall into the \u201chigh risk\u201d category requiring immediate medical attention). Here they are:\n\n1. Have you wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up?\n\n2. Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\n\n3. Have you thought about how you might do this?\n\n4. Have you had any intention of acting on these thoughts of killing yourself?\n\n5. Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Do you intend to carry out this plan?\n\n6. Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\n\nA yes answer to any of these indicates the need for medical care sooner than later, but the last three are the hot-button questions. \u201cIf the answer to 4, 5, or 6 is yes, immediately escort [your friend] to emergency personnel for care, call 1-800-273-8255, text 741741 or call 911,\u201d the website says.\n\nThen in all capital letters comes this call to action: \u201cDON\u2019T LEAVE THE PERSON ALONE. STAY WITH THEM UNTIL THEY ARE IN THE CARE OF PROFESSIONAL HELP.\u201d\n\nPosner Gerstenhaber says she hopes \u201cevery teacher, parent, peer, and coach can . . . be equipped with these simple questions to help those at risk connect to the care they need.\u201d\n\nIsn\u2019t this a violation of a friend\u2019s privacy? I asked. No, she said. \u201cWhen people are suffering they actually want help and are grateful to be asked and often do not have the will to ask for help\u201d themselves.\n\nIn a way, these questions remind me of the \u201cFAST\u201d warning signs for stroke (Face drooping, Arm weakness or Speech difficulty = Time to call 911). See a problem; do something fast. The difference is there\u2019s no stigma to stroke.\n\nBut let\u2019s be honest: Not all medical conditions are equal, and people with mental health issues continue to be plagued by stigma and misconceptions. Their friends \u2014 our friends \u2014 need our loved ones to step up and reach out at the signs of danger.\n\nYes, it feels scary to do so, but then again you might save a life.\n\nIf you are in crisis, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) or text HOME to 741741. Both work 24/7.
