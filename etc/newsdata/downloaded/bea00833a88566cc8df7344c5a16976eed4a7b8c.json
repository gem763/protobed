They also pointed to a New York Times report that said Pentagon officials \"tried to make a case to the White House that the Ukraine aid was effective and should not be looked at in the same manner as other aid.\"\n\nHouse Democrats launched the impeachment inquiry last month amid reports of Trump's July phone conversation with the Ukrainian president, during which he asked the Ukrainian leader to \"look into\" former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Trump's decision to unexpectedly froze nearly $400 million in military aid to the Ukraine days before the call has led to allegations that he was attempting a quid pro quo arrangement.\n\nIn early September, the committees first requested documents related to the suspension of aid and, after multiple follow-up requests, Oversight Chairman Cummings issued a subpoena over the documents to Mulvaney last Friday. The aid was reinstated in September.\n\nSo far, Democrats have issued five subpoenas as part of the impeachment probe. The others target Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Democrats have also requested documents from Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nDemocrats plan to hear from U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland behind closed doors on Tuesday about Ukraine and from former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch on Friday.\n\nLast week, former U.S. special envoy Kurt Volker and intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson testified before lawmakers about the initial whistleblower's complaint.", "description": "Democrats have so far issued five subpoenas as part of the impeachment probe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4215550/1000x563_nbc-191007-adam-schiff-cs-1249p_6a02a668cb91ce5d732d89f759dd5299.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
