No other nation; very simple.\u201d\n\nTrump is claiming credit for ending a problem that he created. After a conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and against the advice of many foreign-policy aides, Trump decided to withdraw U.S. forces from critical positions in northeastern Syria and abandon Kurdish troops that had been U.S. allies. His action was in effect a green light for Turkish-backed troops to invade.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTurkey has long considered elements of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) \u2014 who were critical to the defeat of the Islamic State\u2019s caliphate \u2014 to be a terrorist threat. To prevent a Turkish invasion, the United States persuaded the SDF to pull back up to nine miles from the Turkish border. In August, the SDF destroyed its own military posts after assurances the United States would not let thousands of Turkish troops invade. But then Trump tossed that aside.\n\nTrump then hastily tried to arrange a pause in the fighting, and during that period, Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to joint security patrols that will force Kurdish fighters from the areas they had controlled in Syria. So, in effect, the vacuum created by the U.S. departure has bolstered Russia\u2019s influence in the region.\n\nAs Trump spoke at the White House, his special envoy on the Syria crisis gave an entirely different message to lawmakers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe obviously had troops there for a mission and that mission was defeating ISIS,\u201d Ambassador James Jeffrey told the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cSo if you remove those troops before that mission is complete, then you have a problem. And we do have a problem right now.\u201d\n\nJeffrey added that the Turkish invasion \u201chas scrambled the entire northeast, undercut our efforts against ISIS and brought in the Russians and Syrian regime forces in a way that\u2019s really tragic for everyone involved.\u201d\n\nA former foreign minister of Iraq \u2014 a Kurd \u2014 summed up the view from the region.\n\nThe #Kurds are not safer. Many factual errors in #US President @realDonaldTrump statement on victory declaration in #Syria after the deal with #Turkey .They have handed over #NE Syria to their adversaries. The vacuum will be filled by others full stop. \u2014 Hoshyar Zebari (@HoshyarZebari) October 23, 2019\n\n\u201cTurkey, Syria and all forms of the Kurds have been fighting for centuries. We have done them a great service, and we\u2019ve done a great job for all of them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump frequently and misleadingly frames this as a \u201ccenturies\u201d-long conflict between the Turks and the Kurds. There has been a hundred-year effort to create a Kurdish state in the aftermath of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, with the Kurds frequently manipulated by great powers seeking to flex their muscles against a particular nation, such as Iraq. The Kurds were promised a country in the 1920 Treaty of S\u00e9vres, which broke up the Ottoman Empire, but that promise was abandoned in the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne after the new Turkish government rejected the terms of the previous treaty.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe were supposed to be there for 30 days. That was almost 10 years ago. So we\u2019re there for 30 days, and now we\u2019re leaving. Supposed to be a very quick hit and let\u2019s get out, and it was a quick hit except they stayed for almost 10 years.\u201d\n\nThis is a made-up \u201cfact.\u201d In October 2015 \u2014 four years ago \u2014 President Barack Obama deployed a small number of troops to advise and assist local forces fighting against the Islamic State. Then-White House spokesman Josh Ernest said the initial deployment would be small, \u201cless than 50.\u201d He said \u201cthey will not have a combat mission,\u201d which they never have. Troops were added, but no official said anything even remotely about 30 days or any timetable at all.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLet someone else fight over this long-bloodstained sand.\u201d\n\nTrump needs to brush up on his geography. The Kurdish region is mountainous and verdant, not a desert. This was emphasized in the 2007 public relations campaign launched by Iraqi Kurdistan, when it tried to pitch itself to Americans as \u201cthe other Iraq.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGeneral Mazloum has assured me that ISIS is under very, very strict lock and key, and the detention facilities are being strongly maintained. There were a few that got out, a small number, relatively speaking, and they\u2019ve been largely recaptured.\u201d\n\nMazloum is a nom de guerre for Ferhat Abdi \u015eahin, commander of the SDF. Both Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Jeffrey, the special envoy, have said that more than 100 Islamic State militants have escaped in the chaos. There is no indication that they have been recaptured, as Trump said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe would say that the number is now over 100. We do not know where they are,\u201d Jeffrey told lawmakers, adding: \u201cISIS is pitching this as a victory for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThrough much work, we have done things that everybody said couldn\u2019t be done. Today\u2019s announcement validates our course of action with Turkey that only a couple of weeks ago was scorned. And now people are saying, \u2018Wow, what a great outcome. Congratulations.\u2019\"\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s handling of Syria has been roundly criticized by lawmakers in both parties.\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s remarks, the criticism continued, even from Republicans:\n\nErdogan has NOT agreed to stop all military operations in #Syria #Russia is going to:\n\n-Remove Kurdish forces from east & west of current Turk controlled areas,including Kurdish cities\n\n-Help #Turkey push all SDF forces 30km south from entire border\n\n-Take control of 5 oil fields \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 23, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s unthinkable that Turkey would not suffer consequences for malevolent behavior which was contrary to the interests of the United States and our friends. \u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) October 23, 2019\n\nOnly the Turks or the Russians might have described it as a \u201cgreat outcome,\u201d since it advanced their aims in the region.\n\nAD\n\nJulia Davis in the Daily Beast rounded up some of the reaction in Russia:\n\n\u201cPutin won the lottery! Russia\u2019s unexpected triumph in the Middle East,\u201d raved Mikhail Rostovsky in his article for the Russian newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets. \u201cThose who were convinced of Trump\u2019s uselessness for Russia ought to think again...What Washington got out of this strange move is completely unclear. To the contrary, what Moscow gained from this is self-evident...Trump\u2019s mistake in Syria is the unexpected \u2018lottery win\u2019 that further strengthened Moscow\u2019s position in the Middle East and undermined America\u2019s prestige as a rational political player and a reliable partner.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since America has been humiliated this way,\u201d gloated political analyst Mikhail Sinelnikov-Orishak, \u201cThey ran away in shame! I can\u2019t recall such a scenario since Vietnam.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last administration said [Syrian President Bashar] Assad must go. They could have easily produced that outcome, but they didn\u2019t. In fact, they drew a very powerful red line in the sand \u2014 you all remember the red line in the sand \u2014 when children were gassed and killed, but then did not honor their commitment, as other children died in the same horrible manner. But I did honor my commitments with 58 Tomahawks.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d statement was one the low points of his presidency. (We detailed the ad hoc fashion in which he adopted it in this 2013 fact check.) After Obama decided not to attack Syria over its chemical weapons use, he instead decided to negotiate a deal under which the Syrian government would give up its chemical weapons stockpile. The Obama White House touted that as a great achievement, but later it emerged that Syria did not declare all of its stocks and still attacked citizens with chemical weapons not covered by the 2013 agreement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, when Obama was weighing an attack, guess who told him it would be a mistake?\n\nPresident Obama, do not attack Syria. There is no upside and tremendous downside. Save your \"powder\" for another (and more important) day! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2013\n\n\u201cWe have spent $8 trillion on wars in the Middle East, never really wanting to win those wars.\u201d\n\nThis is a Bottomless Pinocchio claim. About $1.8 trillion through fiscal 2019 has been spent on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan (which is in Central/South Asia, not the Middle East).\n\nThe Cost of Wars project at Brown University\u2019s Watson Institute has estimated that war on terrorism, including homeland security and military action in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan and additional interest on the debt and medical care for veterans, has totaled almost $5 trillion through fiscal 2019. (Medical care for veterans through fiscal 2056 is an additional $1 trillion.)\n\nAD\n\nTrump every year, for no particular reason, adds another $1 trillion, so this claim has grown from $6 trillion at the start of his administration to $7 trillion in 2018 and now $8 trillion.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe same people pushing for these wars are often the ones demanding America open its doors to unlimited migration from war-torn regions, importing the terrorism and the threat of terrorism right to our own shores.\u201d\n\nTrump has consistently and misleadingly tried to claim that \u201cterrorists\u201d are entering the United States from \u201cwar-torn\u201d countries. But every time the administration has tried to make its case, our fact checks have found the numbers to be dubious or wrong.\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles", "description": "The president glossed over uncomfortable facts and pitched fake ones as he declared victory in Syria", "authors": ["Glenn Kessler", "The Fact Checker"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/mDKEdqcAUFJGc6geOkVu-oMUf1s=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H4YZ2THV3AI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
