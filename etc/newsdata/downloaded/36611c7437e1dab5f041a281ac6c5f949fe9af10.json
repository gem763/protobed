The poor results will exacerbate the struggles for leadership in both parties.\n\nWhy does the AfD alarm mainstream Germany so much?\n\n\"For Thuringia and the democratic centre this is a bitter result,\" the CDU's top candidate in Thuringia, Mike Mohring, said in the regional capital, Erfurt.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The CDU's lead candidate said it was a \"bitter\" result\n\n\"We fought for this democratic centre and this democratic centre did not get a majority.\"\n\nThe AfD was founded in 2013 as an anti-euro party but dramatically shifted its focus to immigration and Islam, building support during the migrant crisis of 2015.\n\nIts leader in Thuringia, former history teacher Bjoern Hoecke, was criticised by Jewish leaders and mainstream parties after he dismissed Berlin's Holocaust memorial as a \"monument of shame\".\n\n\"The sun is rising above the east and soon we will let the sun shine above all of Germany,\" Mr Hoecke told chanting supporters on Sunday.\n\n\"We have made the east blue [the AfD colour] and in just a few years, we will be a people's party for all of Germany.\"\n\nTwo years ago, the AfD shocked Germany's political establishment, acutely sensitive to the country's Nazi past, when it won 12.6% of the vote in a general election and entered parliament for the first time.\n\nThe government warned this month of a high threat posed by right-wing extremism, anti-Semitism and right-wing terrorism.\n\nWill the left return to power in Thuringia?\n\nBodo Ramelow, who became the Linke's first state premier in 2014 in Thuringia, told Germanys ARD channel he saw himself \"clearly strengthened\".\n\n\"My party clearly has the mandate to govern and I will take it up,\" he was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.\n\nBut while the Linke are on track to increase their support from 28.2% to 29% they may not be able to muster enough seats to form another coalition of the left because of the losses suffered by the SPD.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Linke co-leader Katja Kipping (L) lent her support to local Linke colleagues like Susanne Henning-Welsow\n\nThe CDU, which actually came first in Thuringia in 2014 with 33.5%, has previously refused to co-operate with the Linke.\n\nNone of the parties is willing to form a coalition with the AfD.", "description": "Germany's AfD beat the centre-right into third place in a regional election in Thuringia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A6EC/production/_109423724_mediaitem109423722.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
