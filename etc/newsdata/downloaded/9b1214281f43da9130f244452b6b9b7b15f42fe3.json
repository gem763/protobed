U.S. officials have told CBS News they intend to get all the U.S. troops out of northern Syria within a month.\n\nA journalist who works for Russia's state-run press posted video on Tuesday allegedly from inside the abandoned U.S. base in Manbij, right on the western edge of the Kurdish territory, saying: \"I'm now at the American base. Let's see how they're living.\" The reporter also posted video of himself operating a steel barrier meant to thwart suicide truck bombs. There were no Russian troops seen at the base with him, nor any of Assad's forces who they back.\n\nAmerica's quick exit changed the landscape of northern Syria dramatically and immediately. D'Agata and his team not only had to avoid Syrian regime forces as they headed for the Iraqi border on Monday, but the Turkish military and its allied extremist militias, and an emerging ISIS threat, too.\n\nTens of thousands of Kurdish civilians have been caught up in the widening chaos in the region. Victims of indiscriminate shelling have packed into over-stretched hospitals and D'Agata saw for himself how under-resourced the facilities are.\n\nOne surgeon told CBS News they're desperate for medicine and equipment, and on the verge of collapse.\n\nTurkish-backed militias execute soldiers in Syria\n\nThe United Nations estimates at least 160,000 people have been displaced by the fighting already, and that figure keeps climbing.\n\nDefending the offensive in an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal, Turkey's Erdogan said his country had \"reached its limit,\" dealing with the 3.6 million refugees from the Syrian conflict who have sought shelter in his country.\n\nTurkey views the Syrian Kurdish fighters - forces who were once America's most loyal ally in the fight against ISIS - as terrorists who must be eradicated.\n\nKurdish commanders told CBS News on Tuesday that some American troops had actually requested their help in Kobani, where the U.S. has its biggest base in the region, to keep the advancing Syrian regime forces out of the area until they're able withdraw.", "description": "Kurdish civilians are fleeing indiscriminate shelling as U.S. troops and Bashar Assad's Russian-backed forces trade places on an increasingly chaotic battlefield", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/15/89d72916-cf07-45ec-929c-d6c444706382/thumbnail/1200x630/29193bcb7cfe4aa877feb4568ac69b84/turkey-syria-1175954029.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
