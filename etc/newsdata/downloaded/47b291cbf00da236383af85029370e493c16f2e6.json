President Trump will be re-elected by a larger margin of electoral votes than he did in 2016, and the leftist crazies of American politics and media will have solely themselves to blame.\n\nI\u2019ve been saying this on-air more or less since President Trump was elected the first time. But his chances have only gotten better since my original prognostications.\n\nWhile Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff believe they might finally have their \u201cgotcha\u201d moment with the president, he has continually called their bluffs and has now exposed them to Joe and Susie Lunchbucket for who they truly are\u2014partisan shills who hate him more than they love America.\n\nThey lie to the media in an attempt to enlist the complicit audiences in order to fire up the gobsmack machine hoping to create a backlash based on outrage.\n\nBut none of it is working.\n\nMultiple polls give him record highs currently, and more indicate he is ahead of where Obama was at this point.\n\nThe problem is, Lunchbucket America is not as uninformed as they once were. They aren\u2019t ticked with the president, and the more the Democrats attempt to cheat\u2014the more outraged they become\u2014with Democrats.\n\nThe Democrats have also been their own worst enemy.\n\nSo blinded by the smack down of an election route in 2016, (and yes according to the rules of the 50 contests in 50 states\u2014Trump thrashed them), they have been committed to the idea that removing him is more important than getting things done.\n\nSimultaneously, I believe they hoped that in doing so the entanglement would occupy Trump\u2019s time and attention and that he would be less (or perhaps completely) ineffective.\n\nThe value of having a real-world CEO who understands how to do multiple things at once is that he has easily accomplished far more than the average president in his first term. All while harassing the Democrats in return on Twitter.\n\nHe\u2019s kept 87 campaign pledges in term one.\n\nObama kept one.\n\nBush kept two.\n\nIn doing so he\u2019s also changed the landscape for how the Democrats have traditionally executed their political goals. They normally depend upon judicial fiat to hold up whatever gender-bending, morality-shaping, norm-busting crazy idea they come up with.\n\nWith literally hundreds of judges confirmed, and more waiting to be confirmed, he has significantly returned the entire federal judiciary back to a strict-construction, author\u2019s-original-intent, focus to the courts.\n\nAll this time the Democrats wasted their days. Instead of coming up with bonafide new ideas to solve problems, they drilled down on hoax after hoax.\n\nThe Democrats are so unnervingly unsure of themselves that they can\u2019t even do their fake impeachment properly. They prevent the Republicans from getting to call witnesses of their own. And in one notable attempted showdown a subcommittee chair attempted to shame a congressional member as to his line of questioning and warned he\u2019d not be allowed to continue if he didn\u2019t get off the issue at hand.\n\nThe Democrats pretend not to know about how the dossier got written\u2014but they wrote it. They pretend they know nothing of the fraud in the FISA applications\u2014but they authored them. They pretended that Blasey-Ford was just an innocent woman who chose to speak\u2014but they recruited, trained, and coached her. They pretended to have no knowledge of these current and forthcoming \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d\u2014but they are actually creating them.\n\nThey lie\u2014but accuse the president of doing so.\n\nThey consult with foreign powers to invent dirt on an actual opponent\u2014but want to impeach a president who is trying to ferret out those who shoveled the dirt in the 2016 corruption.\n\nThey ignore a vice president from their party pushing his thumb down on the scale, and bragging about withholding military aid from allies, while accusing the president of doing so, all the while lacking evidence of such.\n\nThe Democrats lie, cheat, steal and slander because they have spent their time hating one man.\n\nAnd what\u2019s that one man\u2019s huge crime against the world and the human race?\n\nThat he loves America more than they do. So much so that he puts up with all this garbage and is still returning America to its unchallenged status of greatness.\n\nAnd in Joe and Susie Lunchbucket\u2019s universe that is no crime at all.", "description": "The Democrats will lose 34-38 states in 2020.
