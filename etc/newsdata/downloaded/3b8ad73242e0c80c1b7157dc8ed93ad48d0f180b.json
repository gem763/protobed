REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nThe unprecedented split, which saw more than a third of policymakers, including the central bank chiefs of the bloc\u2019s biggest countries, France and Germany, oppose the new bond purchases, now threatens the effectiveness of policy.\n\nFacing a protracted slowdown, the ECB decided last month to cut interest rates deeper into negative territory and to buy bonds indefinitely, with the aim of cutting borrowing costs to stimulate investment and growth.\n\nBut the push back from some conservative members of the ECB Governing Council, which has since spilled into the public debate, raises questions about the bank\u2019s resolve and the ability of policymakers to work together.\n\nThe minutes of the Sept. 12 meeting, published on Thursday, are the latest evidence of division at the top of the ECB.\n\nThey follow a long list of frustrated statements from policy hawks who feel they have been strong-armed into a measure that ties the hands of the ECB well past the end this month of Mario Draghi\u2019s eight-year term as the bank\u2019s chief.\n\n\u201cJudging from the latest series of news reports, press statements, interviews and rumors, the ECB seems to be in the middle of a War of the Roses,\u201d ING economist Carsten Brzeski said, referring to the 15th century power struggles in England.\n\n\u201cAs entertaining as the current divisions at the ECB might be, it harms the bank\u2019s credibility and consequently its effectiveness,\u201d Brzeski added.\n\nOpponents of restarting the quantitative easing (QE) program that was shuttered late last year said that open-ended bond-buying could force the ECB to breach self-imposed purchase limits and put it at risk of a fresh legal challenge.\n\n\u201cThis would exhaust the purchasable universe and call into question the program limits, which were considered important to ensure that the boundary between monetary policy and fiscal policy were not blurred,\u201d the account of the meeting showed.\n\nThe Financial Times reported on Thursday that the monetary policy committee, which prepares options for policymakers, had opposed the fresh bond purchases, while the legal committee pointed to the danger of breaching the thresholds.\n\nWhile committee recommendations are not binding, opposition from both policymakers and staff at the euro zone\u2019s 19 national central banks highlights the divisions within an institution that normally strives for consensus.\n\nTwo of six members of the ECB\u2019s executive board opposed the bond purchases while a third expressed reservations about the rate cut. Sabine Lautenschlaeger, Germany\u2019s representative on the board, has since quit, blaming her \u201csituation\u201d at the bank.\n\nThe ECB can buy up to a third of each member country\u2019s debt and it is getting close to this threshold in Germany, indicating that incoming ECB chief Christine Lagarde will have little time before she must contemplate amending the bank\u2019s own rules.\n\nOpponents of more asset purchases also said they would not be effective given already low bond yields, and that such a tool should be reserved for emergencies, the accounts showed.\n\nThe accounts did not specify how much room the ECB had to buy more bonds but said there was a \u201csignificant\u201d period before the limits would be hit.\n\nThe document also showed that some policymakers were ready to support a bigger rate cut of 20 basis points if the stimulus package excluded fresh bond purchases.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB) holds a news conference on the outcome of the Governing Council meeting at the ECB headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany April 10, 2019.
