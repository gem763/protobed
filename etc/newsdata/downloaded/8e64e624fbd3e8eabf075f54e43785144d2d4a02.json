That follows a 35.8% increase in their national TV spending last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s from a low base, obviously, because until three years ago, they were almost 100% digital, but the growth continues to be strong,\u201d said Vincent L\u00e9tang, executive vice president of global market intelligence at Magna, which is part of Interpublic Group of Co s.\n\nDTC companies made their mark by cutting out middlemen such as physical retail distributors and using targeted social-media advertising to find customers instead.\n\nAs they have matured, however, high-profile examples such as Warby Parker and Casper Sleep Inc. have opened stores and begun advertising more broadly.\n\nTraditional ad sellers now hope that they can become a major new revenue source.\n\nExcluding the effects of cyclical events such as elections and World Cup soccer, overall ad spending in the U.S. will grow 6.3% this year to $221 billion, Magna predicted, adjusting an earlier forecast of 5.1%.\n\nWithout the benefit of cyclical events, ad spending growth will slow next year to 3.8% as economic growth decelerates, according to Magna.\n\n\u201cThe good news from an advertising standpoint is that historically, advertising is correlated to personal spending more than overall gross domestic product, and personal spending is not expected to slow down that much,\u201d Mr. L\u00e9tang said. \u201cConsumer brands need to speak to individual consumers.\u201d\n\nFactoring in the 2020 election campaign cycle as well as advertising around the Tokyo Summer Olympics, however, will yield a 6.2% overall jump in ad spending next year, Magna said, adjusting its previous 5.8% forecast upward.\n\nPolitical campaigns are likely to continue boosting their activity on social media, providing an incremental lift of roughly 3% next year, and local TV will continue to collect the largest slice of campaign spending, Mr. L\u00e9tang said.\n\n\u201cIncreasing political budgets will allow every media type to benefit to a degree,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Nat Ives at nat.ives@wsj.com", "description": "So-called direct-to-consumer marketers increased their ad spending 32% in the first half of the year, but grew their national TV ad spending by 52.9%, according to estimates from ad-buying group Magna Global.
