She was pretty much speechless. After a few nervous laughs, she got emotional, it was so much to process.\u201d\n\nThe next day the girls saw each other face to face on a video call.\n\nAudrey, now 13, says: \u201cI was shocked. I didn\u2019t think it was real.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I said anything, I just cried. It was very emotional.\u201d\n\nTheir incredible story is told tonight in ITV\u2019s Long Lost Family series, about twins who were separated at birth.\n\n(Image: Collect unknown)\n\nThe Chinese researcher found the girls had been left in different places by their mother as babies but had been taken to the same orphanage.\n\nJennifer says: \u201cBecause Audrey had a heart condition and was very sick when we brought her home, I didn\u2019t know if her twin was alive.\n\n\"She could be anywhere in the world, she might not speak the same language, and her adoptive parents might not want to know who we were.\u201d\n\nIncredibly, using the girl\u2019s name and date of birth and posting appeals on Facebook , it took just two days to find the family who had adopted her.\n\nThey were living 1,500 miles away in Richland, Washington state.\n\nJennifer says: \u201cI was astounded when I looked at their Facebook page and saw a picture of them with a girl who looked just like my daughter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the craziest thing in the world to look at your child exactly. I mean, everything was the same. The same hair, the same glasses, the same outfits.\n\n\u201cThere was never any doubt we\u2019d tell Audrey. I couldn\u2019t imagine waiting until my daughter\u2019s 18th. Once we knew, we couldn\u2019t undo it.\u201d\n\nNicole, who with her husband Scott also has three biological children, was equally shocked when, on December 8, 2016, she got a message from Jennifer.\n\nShe says: \u201cIt was very upsetting, \u00adoverwhelming and hard to process. I was so confused, how and why did this happen?\n\n\u201cThe whole thing \u00adterrified me because I didn\u2019t know how all of our lives would change.\n\n\u201cWe considered whether we should tell Gracie right away or wait until she was older. It was a fleeting thought \u2013 it was something she deserved to know as soon as possible.\u201d\n\n(Image: Collect unknown)\n\nThe day after telling Gracie about her twin in Wisconsin, Jennifer and husband Tom sat down with Audrey to break the news \u2013 just before that emotional video call.\n\nJennifer remembers: \u201cWhen both girls came up on the screen it was an incredible moment. They just looked at each other and started crying.\n\n\u201cBoth had their hair in ponytails to one side, and were wearing the same pair of glasses. Even though we live in different parts of the country, they spoke in exactly the same way.\n\n\u201cTheir mannerisms were exactly the same and they even cried the same way. It was so emotional we had to stop and take a moment, then call her back.\n\n\u201cMy husband helped initiate some of the conversation, but after that they started chatting, like they\u2019d been together for years.\u201d\n\nThe two girls met up a month later, live on US TV.\n\nJennifer says: \u201cWe\u2019ve been astonished at how alike they are. They talk the same, like the same things, right down to their favourite food and subjects.\n\n\u201cThey are laughing one minute and crying the next. They both get nervous a lot too, and when they do they push their glasses up their noses in exactly the same way.\u201d\n\nGracie\u2019s mum Nicole said: \u201cIt was amazing to me that math was both their favourite subject and despite both having heart conditions that they were amazing athletes.\u201d\n\nThe girls see each other several times a year, including summer camps.\n\nAudrey went to Gracie\u2019s home for Christmas last year.\n\nThey visited London for the Long Lost Family TV show, when they met twins expert Professor Tim Spector for tests looking at whether genes or \u00adenvironment makes us who we are.\n\n(Image: NBC News)\n\nAudrey says: \u201cI just love being together with her. When we\u2019re not together I miss her a lot. We speak or text every day. We have this connection, it\u2019s like she\u2019s part of me.\n\n\u201cThe only way we\u2019re different is I dress up more than Gracie. I like wearing girly clothes and she wears more sporty clothes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how to explain it,\u201d Gracie says. \u201cGetting to have her is like having another part of me. Whenever we talk and get together, I just feel a connection. I can talk to her about a lot of things and I know she will help me through it, and I feel I can do the same for her.\u201d\n\nBut in a nod to nurture versus nature, Audrey wants to go into medicine like her physician\u2019s assistant mum and gynaecologist dad, while Gracie wants to be a teacher like her mum.\n\nNicole says: \u201cI\u2019ve no doubt they will continue to grow closer as they get older, and will remain close throughout their lives.\u201d\n\nJennifer says: \u201cAll things happen for a reason. I\u2019m so glad I opened that email, even thought it turned our worlds upside down. We feel very lucky now.\u201d\n\nLong Lost Family Twins: What Happened Next, ITV Monday, October 28, 9pm", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Tom and Jennifer Doering of Wisconsin, USA, experienced an emotional rollercoaster after discovering their daughter Audrey was a twin", "authors": ["Matt Roper", "Image", "Facebook", "Collect Unknown", "Nbc News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20736004.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_long_lost_family_twins_06JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
