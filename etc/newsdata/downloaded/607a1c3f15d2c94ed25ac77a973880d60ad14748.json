USA TODAY\n\nThe don't hand out Oscars for the best achievements in film halfway through the year. But college football isn't the Academy Awards.\n\nThere's been plenty of superlatives through the first seven weeks of the season worth recognizing. Unfortunately, there's also been some negatives worth calling out, too.\n\nWe asked our academy of college football experts to weigh in on the highs and lows on the key topics from the first half of the season so that the overachievers and underachievers can be acknowledged.\n\nSo without further ado (drumroll, please), here are the USA TODAY midseason college football awards. Please hold your applause until all the winners have been announced.\n\nBest individual performance\n\nPaul Myerberg: Tua Tagovailoa, Alabama \u2014 You try to be a contrarian and go against the grain but then you look at the numbers. The 27 touchdowns with just one interception. The 11 yards per attempt. The efficiency rating of 214.3. He\u2019s completing 73.6 percent of his attempts. In the year with no shortage of elite quarterback play, Tagovailoa has been the best of the bunch and better than ever.\n\nAlabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa escapes the pocket as he looks to pass against Mississippi.

This season, he\u2019s been spectacular. We can talk all we want about LSU\u2019s amazing production since finally committing to 21st-Century offense \u2013 but Burrow, who is completing almost 80 percent of his passes, is the undisputed catalyst, and maybe the best offensive player in the country.\n\nErick Smith: Jalen Hurts, Oklahoma \u2014 One of the intriguing questions of the season was how marries of Sooners coach Lincoln Riley and Hurts would go. But in just nine months on campus, Hurts has morphed into the leader of the Heisman Trophy race, while ranking second in the country in passing efficiency and yards per carry. Oh, and he beat Oklahoma's biggest rival, too.\n\nEddie Timanus: Joe Burrow, LSU \u2014 Sure, that fellow in Tuscaloosa has also been quite good. But Burrow, so far at least, has faced better competition. He was nearly flawless Saturday night on the big stage against Florida, throwing as many touchdowns (three) as incomplete passes\n\nBest coaching direction\n\nPaul Myerberg: Paul Chryst, Wisconsin \u2014 One year after Wisconsin experienced a rare flop amid major preseason expectations, Chryst has the Badgers right back in the thick of things in the race for the Big Ten and College Football Playoff. He's done great work with quarterback Jack Coan, who's completing 76.3 percent of his throws, while the Badgers' defense has pitched four shutouts through six games.\n\nGeorge Schroeder: Sonny Dykes, SMU \u2014 SMU is 6-0, y\u2019all. We repeat: SMU is 6-0. Congrats to Dykes, who has the Mustangs in position no one saw coming, probably because we haven\u2019t seen it since 1982, which was back in the glory days before the program got the NCAA\u2019s death penalty.\n\nErick Smith: James Franklin, Penn State \u2014 Franklin could have easily handed the quarterback job to senior Tommy Stevens and nobody would have blinked an eye. But he made it clear there would be a competition, so Stevens left and untested sophomore Sean Clifford took the reins. The Nittany Lions - with Clifford's help and a fierce defense - have run off six consecutive wins and look like the only team in the Big Ten East capable of slowing Ohio State.\n\nEddie Timanus: Herm Edwards, Arizona State \u2014 Remember when all the so-called experts were shaking their collective heads when this hire was made? Bringing a guy from the TV studio back to the sidelines? It\u2019ll never work. Well, it\u2019s working. The Sun Devils have shown they can win in a defensive slog (Michigan State) or a shootout (Washington State), and they seem to be getting better. Looks like pretty good coaching to me.\n\nBOWL PROJECTIONS: Everything below the playoff is shaken up\n\nRE-RANK: Ohio State remains in No. 1 spot, Oklahoma moves up\n\nWINNERS AND LOSERS: Highs and lows from Week 7 in college football\n\nBest game\n\nPaul Myerberg: Tulane 38, Houston 31 \u2014 This featured the best finish of the season. On the game's final offensive play, Tulane quarterback Justin McMillan hit wide receiver Jalen McCleskey, who pinballed off three Houston defenders and ran into the end zone for a 53-yard touchdown. This came after Willie Fritz faked a kneeldown to set up the game-winning score. The two teams combined for 51 first downs and 1,044 yards of offense.\n\nGeorge Schroeder: UCLA 67, Washington State 63 \u2014This should not be equated to well-played. But for sheer entertainment value, the #Pac12AfterDark insta-classic in which the Bruins came from waaaaaay back to upset the Cougars 67-63 can\u2019t be beat. (UCLA can be beaten, before that game and afterward. But not that night.)\n\nErick Smith: Pittsburgh 35, Central Florida 34 \u2014 The Panthers jumped out to a 21-0 lead before the Knights scored 31 consecutive points and appeared on the verge of adding to their 27-game regular-season win streak. Pitt responded, however, and scored the winning touchdown on a \"Pittsburgh Special\" trick play with less than a minute left.\n\nEddie Timanus: UCLA 67, Washington State 63 \u2014 It happened in the dead of night, so most of America probably didn\u2019t see it. But this game was the very definition of #Pac12AfterDark. It had a little of everything \u2014big plays, big mistakes, a crazy comeback \u2014 well, everything except overtime. Unfortunately it proved to be just a one-off for the Bruins.\n\nUCLA quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson (1) and running back Sitiveni Kaufusi celebrate after defeating Washington State at Martin Stadium.

Add in the fact that SMU has one winning season since 2013 and was picked to finish fourth in the West Division in the league\u2019s preseason poll and you can see why second-year coach Sonny Dykes is on the shortlist for national coach of the year.\n\nGeorge Schroeder: Baylor and Minnesota \u2014 Roughly no one predicted that at the halfway point, Baylor would be unbeaten and tied with Oklahoma atop the Big 12 standings. The non-conference schedule was light. The Bears have had some good fortune (see, ahem, that super-bad call in overtime that helped them past Texas Tech). Their Big 12 schedule is backloaded with both Oklahoma and Texas. But consider Matt Rhule\u2019s two-plus seasons: 1-11, 7-6 \u2026 6-0.\n\nMeanwhile, after blowing out Nebraska last week, the Gophers are 6-0, as well. Sure, it has happened against a soft schedule. If they don\u2019t feel like real Big Ten contenders, they\u2019ll get their shot to prove us wrong in a couple of weeks against Penn State. Is it possible the regular-season finale against Wisconsin could decide the Big Ten West?\n\nErick Smith: Justin Fields \u2014 He didn't fit at Georgia in the limited sample size last season. And there were concerns about how quickly he could fit at Ohio State. But that is no longer the case. Showing running and passing skills, Fields is the Heisman candidate that isn't getting enough attention as the Buckeyes look like the No. 1 team.\n\nEddie Timanus: Minnesota \u2014 Four narrow wins to start the season had people wondering if the Golden Gophers were for real. But P.J. Fleck\u2019s rowboat has picked up speed, and the schedule affords the opportunity to be 8-0 heading into a tough November slate.\n\nBiggest disappointment\n\nPaul Myerberg: The ACC \u2014 Everyone but Clemson, that is. Pegged as a one-horse show, the league has been even worse than expected. Syracuse has been a disaster. Florida State is once again overmatched. Virginia Tech and Miami (Fla.) have disappointed. The Tigers are the only ACC team ranked in this week\u2019s Amway Coaches Poll, and things may stay that way for the foreseeable future.\n\nGeorge Schroeder: Georgia\u2019s 20-17 loss to South Carolina is inexplicably bad. Oh, and did we mention the Gamecocks were down to their third-team quarterback (on the season-opening depth chart), and that it happened Between the Hedges? Georgia, which was a chic preseason pick to win the national championship, still has all its goals intact. But there\u2019s no remaining margin for error. And that horrendous loss revealed flaws that might well mean more error is ahead.\n\nGeorgia place kicker Rodrigo Blankenship (98) reacts after missing a field goal in the second overtime against South Carolina.

Reports of an injured shoulder make sense when you consider how he has just 11 touchdown passes with six interceptions. Once the Heisman front-runner, he's an afterthought for the award. That said, the Tigers are still unbeaten and have time to round into form for the College Football Playoff.\n\nEddie Timanus: Texas A&M \u2014 Yes, the schedule has been a killer. But the Aggies were never in a position to challenge any of the three highly-rated teams they\u2019ve faced, and in fact nearly lost to a bad one. And things aren\u2019t going to get any easier in the second half.\n\nBiggest upset\n\nPaul Myerberg: Kansas 48, Boston College 24 \u2014 \u201cBest\u201d is subjective, since Boston College wouldn\u2019t agree that this game qualifies. And it's not like the Eagles are world-beaters. Still, a Kansas team that's otherwise 0-4 against FBS competition racked up 329 rushing yards and 567 yards of total offense in nailing down the program's first road win against a Power Five opponent since 2008.\n\nGeorge Schroeder: South Carolina 20, Georgia 17 \u2014 See \u201cBiggest Disappointment,\u201d and then rotate to view through the prism of the visitors. South Carolina hadn\u2019t been very good, and then they lost quarterback Ryan Hilinski to injury, and then they scored only three points in the final 31, plus two overtime periods \u2013 and they somehow notched the biggest victory of Will Muschamp\u2019s tenure.\n\nErick Smith: Bowling Green 20, Toledo 7 \u2014 The Falcons hadn't played within 28 points of their four FCS opponents before facing the Rockets. They had allowed fewer than 35 points in those four losses. Yet, somehow they slowed down the MAC leaders for their first win the series since 2009 and gave a big lift to first-year coach Scot Loeffler.\n\nEddie Timanus: South Carolina 20, Georgia 17 \u2014 The game itself wasn\u2019t pretty, and it was more a case of the Bulldogs losing it. But it was still a huge win for Will Muschamp\u2019s Gamecocks, and it\u2019s been the only result from the first half of the season that altered our perception of the playoff contenders.", "description": "The halfway mark of the college football season means it's time to hand out awards with Jalen Hurts, Joe Burrow and Tua Tagovailoa.", "authors": ["Usa Today Sports", "Published A.M.
