Not bad for a Western \u2014 a genre that\u2019s periodically written off as obsolete, generally right before it emerges from its slumber to remind people of why the genre resonated in the first place.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times, the show\u2019s creator, Taylor Sheridan, weighed in on the place of the genre. \u201cBefore Hell or High Water, I was told, \u2018Westerns are dead.\u2019 My argument was, \u2018No, bad Westerns are dead.\u2019 There\u2019s still an appetite for them,\u201d he said.\n\nSheridan would know: he wrote the acclaimed film Hell or High Water and both wrote and directed Wind River \u2014 both of which utilize contemporary settings but are nonetheless undeniably Westerns.\n\nSheridan is perhaps the highest-profile filmmaker working with the genre right now, but he\u2019s not alone. Quentin Tarantino\u2019s The Hateful Eight blended elements of the Western with the drawing-room mystery; while not set on the frontier, his earlier Django Unchained borrowed more than a few tropes from the Western genre. Tarantino later made this connection to Westerns more explicit: in collaboration with Matt Wagner, he wrote a graphic novel which teamed Django with legendary swordsman Zorro. Earlier this year, news broke that an adaptation of that storyline might be coming to the big screen.\n\nTarantino isn\u2019t the only acclaimed filmmaker with a fondness for Westerns \u2014 and a penchant for taking the genre in odd directions. Joel and Ethan Coen\u2019s most recent film, The Ballad of Buster Struggs, featured six storylines set in the West that explored permutations of the brothers\u2019 preferred themes of betrayal, mortality, and humanity\u2019s connection to an indifferent universe. The Coens had played with the genre before: they\u2019ve also adapted both Charles Portis\u2019s True Grit and Cormac McCarthy\u2019s No Country For Old Men for the screen.\n\n(Technically, Westworld does borrow more than a little of its imagery from Westerns \u2014 though if the trailer for its third season is any indication, that may no longer be the case \u2014 but its themes place it pretty clearly in the realm of the science fictional.)\n\nHead over to the literary side of the fence and you\u2019ll find even more interesting and acclaimed permutations of the Western in recent years. Patrick deWitt\u2019s The Sisters Brothers, about a pair of sibling gunslingers, was made into an acclaimed film last year. Colin Winnette\u2019s novel Haints Stay told a haunting and surreal tale of two outlaws fighting for survival in an increasingly hostile landscape. And Alma Katsu\u2019s The Hunger riffed on the history of the Donner Party and threw a smidgen of outright horror into the mix, to great acclaim.\n\nSome acclaimed literary works have revisited the Western by engaging directly with its mythology, whether real or fictional. Robert Coover\u2019s 2017 novel Huck Out West imagined Huckleberry Finn navigating his way through the expansive Western landscape, while Norman Lock\u2019s American Meteor alluded to the real-life exploits of photographer William Henry Jackson, whose work helped popularize certain images of the West. And Forrest Gander\u2019s The Trace told a contemporary story set largely in western Mexico with echoes of the legendary author Ambrose Bierce.\n\nAs a genre, Westerns offer writers a way to grapple with the weight of history, along with questions of race and class. The 1990s nominally brought the age of revisionist Westerns (Tombstone, The Quick and the Dead) \u2014 but one could also argue that this began far earlier than that, with John Ford\u2019s 1962 film The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. But these themes have always been present, and at a time when the issues that Westerns raise are paramount in American consciousness, it\u2019s not difficult to see the appeal of the genre. It explains the popularity of Yellowstone, or why fans were eager to see HBO\u2019s Deadwood get one last chapter over a decade after it went off the air.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to keep a good genre down \u2014 and in the right hands, the Western has the potential to be more relevant than ever. The next time someone tells you stories about people trying to make it in the wilds of America is dead, it\u2019s worth telling them that they may not be looking in the right places.", "description": "Shows like Yellowstone, HBO giving Deadwood one last chapter and novels by Patrick deWitt and Colin Winnette show the genre isn't dead.", "authors": ["Tobias Carroll"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/yellowstone-still.jpg?fit=1200%2C800"}
