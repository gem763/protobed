Now, the ousted Ukraine ambassador is a key impeachment witness", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday dismissed questions about US President Donald Trump's attempts to push Ukraine and China to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden as a \"silly gotcha game.\" (Oct. 5) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump called her \"bad news.\" And Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, sought her removal as ambassador to Ukraine, suggesting she was undermining the president.\n\nNow, Marie L. Yovanovitch \u2013 a career diplomat with decades of overseas experience \u2013 is the next witness in the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry. Lawmakers want to question Yovanovitch on what she knew about efforts by Trump and Giuliani to push Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading 2020 Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nHer testimony will be \"very important\" to Democrats' impeachment inquiry of Trump, said Harold Hongju Koh, a professor of international law at Yale University who worked with Yovanovitch at the State Department.\n\nGiuliani has publicly acknowledged that he pressed Ukrainian government officials to open an investigation into Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\n\"He was running a private foreign policy on the behest of Trump,\" which bypassed the U.S. embassy in Kiev and other official government channels, Koh said.\n\nYovanovitch, 60, is one of five State Department officials who Democrats have called to Capitol Hill for depositions, as they investigate allegations that Trump used the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nOn Thursday, federal prosecutors revealed a plot by two Ukrainian-born business partners to enlist the help of a GOP congressman for the purpose of pressuring the Trump administration to remove Yovanovitch from her post as ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nThe two, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, pledged to raise $20,000 for the lawmaker, according to court documents. The congressman was not named in the documents, but a person familiar with the matter identified the lawmaker as former Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas.\n\nSessions wrote a letter last year to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, urging Yovanovitch's ouster. The former congressman could not be immediately reached for comment. Yovanovitch was recalled in May.\n\nParnas and Fruman, who showered Republican campaign committees with nearly $500,000, were charged Thursday in connection with alleged schemes to funnel foreign money to U.S. political campaigns, federal authorities said Thursday.\n\nThe pair also helped Rudy Giuliani meet a Ukrainian prosecutor as the president's personal lawyer pushed for an investigation of Biden. Both of the men are among prospective witnesses House Democrats want to question in their impeachment inquiry.\n\nYovanovitch isscheduled to appear on Friday in a closed-door session before three House committees \u2013 Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform \u2013 that are leading the impeachment inquiry.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Yovanovitch, her role in the Ukraine controversy, and Friday's developments on Capitol Hill.\n\nWill she be allowed to testify?\n\nIf Yovanovitch appears, it will likely be in defiance of the White House and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nYovanovitch was initially scheduled to be the House Democrats' first witness, but her testimony was delayed \u2013 after Pompeo raised questions last week about Democrats' ability to compel State Department officials to appear without a subpoena.\n\nOn Tuesday, the White House broadly condemned the House Democrats' probe as a partisan witchhunt and said it would not cooperate with the inquiry. And the State Department blocked the testimony of Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. House Democrats issued a subpoena to compel Sondland's testimony earlier this week.\n\nDespite those moves, Yovanovitch is planning to appear before the impeachment panel on Friday, according to a House Democratic aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Yovanovitch did not return an email seeking comment.\n\nThe State Department has also not returned messages seeking comment.\n\nIn this March 6, 2019 file photo, then U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, center, sits during her meeting with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in Kiev, Ukraine.

She came to the post with three decades of experience in the foreign service, including stints as the U.S. ambassador to Armenia and to the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\nIn Kiev, Yovanovitch pushed Ukrainian officials to crack down on the country\u2019s endemic corruption, fueled by a circle of politically connected oligarchs. She specifically criticized Yuriy Lutsenko, then Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor, for not aggressively pursuing corruption cases.\n\nLutsenko had been widely seen inside Ukraine as weak on corruption, according to the whistleblower complaint that sparked the impeachment inquiry. That explosive complaint alleged that Trump used the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election, by pressing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Ukrainian officials say they have no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens.\n\nIn his call with Zelensky, Trump criticized Yovanovitch and told the Ukrainian president she's \u201cgoing to go through some things,\" though he did not elaborate.\n\nTrump had already pulled Yovanovitch from her Ukraine ambassador post in May \u2013 before her tenure there was supposed to end \u2013 amid complaints from Giuliani, according to the whistleblower's complaint and other accounts. In May, Giuliani told a Ukrainian journalist that Yovanovitch was \"removed ... because she was part of the efforts against the president.\"\n\nGiuliani further targeted Yovanovitch in a strange packet of \"disinformation\" that he gave to State Department officials earlier this year. The dossier was full of debunked allegations and political smears targeting the president\u2019s perceived enemies, and it eventually made its way to lawmakers leading the impeachment probe.\n\nAfter a briefing on the Giuliani dossier by the State Department's chief watchdog, the three chairmen leading the impeachment inquiry said it raised \"troubling\" new questions about efforts inside and outside the Trump administration to target Yovanovitch and others.\n\nMore than 50 current and former ambassadors have come to Yovanovitch's defense, signing a letter asking Trump to ensure that Yovanovitch isn\u2019t \u201csingled out for retribution for partisan, political reasons.\u201d Trump\u2019s reference to Yovanovitch as \u201cgoing to go through some things\u201d during his call with Zelensky worried the ambassadors.\n\n'A cool customer'\n\nFriday's grilling of Yovanovitch will be led by staff attorneys on the impeachment panel.\n\nShe will likely be asked to detail her dealings with Giuliani and what she knew about the Trump administration's pressure campaign on Zelensky.\n\nPaul Rosenzweig, a former senior counsel with Ken Starr\u2019s independent counsel investigation of President Bill Clinton, said he would ask Yovanovitch about Ukraine's rampant corruption, and whether she was ever asked to use American influence to advance anti-corruption activities.\n\nRosenzweig, now a senior fellow at the R Street Institute, said he would also ask what effect withholding military aid had on the ability of Ukraine to fight Russia. Trump temporarily froze nearly $400 million in security aid to Ukraine while he and Giuliani were pressing for the Biden investigations.\n\nKoh said Yovanovitch is a \"straight shooter\" who will be able to handle the pressure of a congressional grilling and the limelight that comes with it.\n\n\"She\u2019s a cool customer\" who is deeply respected for her foreign service credentials and her eastern Europe expertise, he said. \"She's a straight shooter, by the book.\"\n\nOther State Department officials who have been called for depositions include:\n\n\u2022 Kurt Volker, a onetime U.S. special representative for Ukraine and who played a role arranging meetings between Giuliani and Zelensky\u2019s representatives. He resigned after his name was mentioned in the whistleblower complaint and Giuliani posted private text messages, showing Volker introduced him to a top adviser to the Ukrainian president. Volker's testimony hasn't been released, but in his opening statement, he said Trump sought to fight corruption in Ukraine. \"He said that Ukraine was a corrupt country, full of 'terrible people,'\" Volker recalled. \"He said they 'tried to take me down'.\u201d\n\n\u2022George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary in the European and Eurasian Bureau at State Department, which oversees policy toward Ukraine.\n\n\u2022 T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, a counselor at the State Department who provides strategic guidance to Pompeo. The whistleblower complaint said he was on the call as Trump spoke to Zelensky.\n\nMore about the House impeachment investigation against President Trump:\n\nWhistleblower says Trump used 'the power of his office' to solicit foreign help to discredit Joe Biden\n\nDemocrats subpoena Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, for Ukraine documents\n\nDemocrats accuse Pompeo of 'stonewalling,' after he pushes back on impeachment requests\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/11/marie-yovanovitch-former-ukraine-ambassador-impeachment-witness/3825779002/", "description": "In the House impeachment inquiry, three panels are set to hear from former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who was recalled by President Trump.", "authors": ["Deirdre Shesgreen", "Bart Jansen", "Published A.M.
