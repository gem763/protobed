(AP) - Kyle Allen threw for 261 yards and four touchdowns in place of the injured Cam Newton, Christian McCaffrey ran for a 76-yard touchdown, and the Carolina Panthers beat the Arizona Cardinals 38-20 on Sunday.\n\nThe 23-year-old Allen was outstanding in his second career start, making several big throws - even when there was tight coverage. He was 19 of 26, including two touchdowns to Greg Olsen and one each to Curtis Samuel and DJ Moore.\n\nMcCaffrey had 24 carries for 153 yards, including the 76-yard score, which came in the third quarter when he darted straight through the middle of Arizona\u2019s defense.\n\nNewton was ruled out by the Panthers earlier this week because of a mid-foot sprain. The Panthers were confident Allen would be an adequate replacement and Sunday\u2019s performance was validation.\n\nAllen outplayed Arizona\u2019s Kyler Murray, who was his former college teammate at Texas A&M.; Murray also had some good moments, especially early, including a few long runs and a couple of short touchdown passes to Larry Fitzgerald and David Johnson.\n\nBut Murray\u2019s costly interception late in the third quarter helped the Panthers (1-2) pull away for their first win. He finished 30 of 43 passing for 173 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. He also ran for 69 yards.\n\nMurray was sacked eight times by Carolina\u2019s defense, which improved as the game progressed.\n\nThe Allen vs. Murray quarterback matchup was intriguing since they were college teammates 2015. The highly rated recruits split time under center before both eventually transferred. Murray went on to win the Heisman Trophy at Oklahoma.\n\nAllen - who was playing near his hometown of Scottsdale, Arizona - looked comfortable from the moment he stepped on the field. His only other start last season was also a win, but that one came with a bit of an asterisk. The Panthers won in Week 17 against a New Orleans team that was already looking toward the playoffs.\n\nThis time, both teams were desperate for a win and Allen delivered.\n\nHe was 13 of 18 passing for 173 yards and two touchdowns in the first half, including a 52-yard score to Moore, which pushed the Panthers ahead 14-10 just before halftime.\n\nThe Cardinals (0-2-1) went ahead 17-14 in the third quarter on Murray\u2019s 3-yard pass to Johnson, but the Panthers responded with Allen\u2019s 3-yard touchdown to Olsen.\n\nCarolina pulled away in the second half when McCaffrey ran straight up the middle for his long touchdown and a 28-20 lead.\n\nOn the ensuing drive, Murray was picked off by Donte Jackson and the Panthers took advantage of the short field when Allen hit Olsen for another touchdown and a 35-20 lead.\n\nJONES BIG AGAIN\n\nFor the second time in three games, Arizona\u2019s Chandler Jones forced a fumble and then recovered it.\n\nCarolina was easily driving downfield in the first quarter before Jones sacked Allen, stripped the ball and recovered it on the Arizona 26.\n\nJones\u2019 43 sacks since joining the Cardinals in 2016 are the most for any NFL player over that span.\n\nTIGHT END TROUBLE\n\nAn opposing tight end had another big game against Arizona\u2019s defense. Olsen finished with six catches for 75 yards and the two scores.\n\nDetroit\u2019s T.J. Hockenson had six catches for 131 yards and a touchdown in Week 1. Baltimore\u2019s Mark Andrews had eight catches for 112 yards and a touchdown last weekend.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPanthers: Carolina travels to Houston to face the Texans.\n\nCardinals: Arizona hosts the Seahawks on Sunday for its third home game in four weeks.\n\n___\n\nFollow David Brandt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/davidbrandtAP\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kyle Allen threw for 261 yards and four touchdowns in place of the injured Cam Newton, Christian McCaffrey ran for a 76-yard touchdown, and the Carolina Panthers beat the Arizona Cardinals 38-20 on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Brandt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/panthers_cardinals_football_75784_c0-141-3375-2108_s1770x1032.jpg?b6ce2ddf90e57be9ee7b4177794f24af85defc1a", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
