(Stefan Rousseau/Reuters)\n\nWhat will British foreign policy be like under Boris Johnson\u2019s leadership? With tensions rising between the U.K. and Iran, this is a pressing question.\n\nJohnson, Britain\u2019s newly confirmed prime minister, has been described as the U.K.\u2019s \u201cworst foreign secretary in living memory.\u201d To be fair, this description was by Matthew Parris, an anti-Brexit columnist at the Times of London who, along with many others, blames Johnson for Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU in 2016. Parris has also described Johnson as a \u201chabitual liar,\u201d \u201ccheat,\u201d \u201cconspirator,\u201d and \u201ccruel betrayer [of women].\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonetheless, there are plenty of reasons to be concerned.\n\nJohnson served as Britain\u2019s highest-ranking diplomat under Theresa May from July 2016 until his resignation in 2018 (thanks to irreconcilable differences over Brexit). May\u2019s decision to give Johnson a cabinet role was widely considered an indictment of keeping one\u2019s friends close and one\u2019s enemies closer. But it wasn\u2019t exactly plain sailing from thereon.\n\nOn a rhetorical level, Johnson\u2019s journalistic flair and polemical tendencies have brought problems. In the realm of diplomacy, gaffes have consequences.\n\nTwo months prior to his appointment, Johnson had won The Spectator\u2019s \u201cmost offensive Erdogan poem\u201d contest \u2014 a competition devised by Douglas Murray in response to Angela Merkel\u2019s decision to censor a German comedian who had been rude about Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Murray wanted to prove that \u201cin Britain we still live and breathe free.\u201d Johnson\u2019s victorious entry was as follows:\n\nThere was a young fellow from Ankara Who was a terrific wankerer Till he sowed his wild oats With the help of a goat But he didn\u2019t even stop to thankera.\n\nNaturally, this made Johnson\u2019s visit to Turkey as foreign secretary rather awkward. A far graver indelicacy was in 2017 when Johnson endangered a British-Iranian woman imprisoned in Tehran by mistakenly saying she had been \u201cteaching people journalism.\u201d Though Johnson corrected this, it was used as evidence against her. His decision to cite Rudyard Kipling\u2019s poem Mandalay (a product of the colonialist era) during a visit to the Myanmar temple was described as \u201cnot appropriate\u201d by the British ambassador \u2014 and caught on mic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn a policy level, Johnson has also been criticized for being too cozy with the Saudis. He disagreed with Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Iran deal. He appears sympathetic to Israel. Johnson has been highly critical of President Trump in the past; however, his Euroskepticism is accompanied by an enthusiasm for the special (U.K.-U.S.) relationship and genuine desire to work closely with the 45th president. Trump seems receptive to this.\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s foreign policy \u2014 unpredictable as it is consequential \u2014 will be worth watching closely.", "description": "What will British foreign policy be like under Boris Johnson's leadership?
