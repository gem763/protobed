'They've finally convinced her to impeach the President. All of you know your Constitution. The way that impeachment stops is a Senate majority, with me as majority leader.'\n\n'But I need your help. Please contribute before the deadline,' he added in the video, which was rolled out just days after House Speaker Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn a new social media ad aimed at raising money for his reelection campaign, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (pictured) vows to stop impeachment of Donald Trump at the Senate level \u2013 should it reach the upper chamber\n\nIn the video, McConnel claims that 'Nancy Pelosi is in the clutches of a left-wing mob,' and 'they've finally convinced her to impeach the President'\n\nMcConnell is running for reelection next year for his Senate seat in Kentucky, where Donald Trump earned 62.5 per cent of the vote in the 2016 presidential elections.\n\nThe Republican leader often drums up supporters by playing up his ties to Trump, who remains popular in Kentucky, and McConnell's campaign manager said the impeachment inquiring has fired up the senator's supporters even more.\n\n'Few issues energize conservative voters like liberal overreach and the Democrats' latest outrageous attempt to impeach President Trump has activated our base to new heights,' Kevin Golden said in a statement Saturday night.\n\nEven though McConnell is making it clear he will be a firewall against impeachment, he admitted recently that he would have no choice but to consider articles of impeachment if the House approved charges against Trump.\n\n'It's a Senate rule related to impeachment, it would take 67 votes to change, so I would have no choice but to take it up,' McConnell told CNBC in regards to the Democratic-controlled House. 'How long you're on it is a whole different matter.'\n\nThe impeachment inquiry was opened after it was revealed that Trump urged his Ukrainian counterpart to investigation Joe Biden and his family's business dealings in Ukraine\n\nPelosi announced last month that the House was launching an impeachment inquiry \u2013 a move some Democrats have been pushing since day one of Trump's presidency.\n\nThe final straw for Pelosi, and other previously on-the-fence Democrats, were revelations in September that a whistle-blower filed a complaint in August that alleged Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelesnky to investigate Joe Biden and his family.\n\nSome also allege the president's July 25 call with Zelesnky, which the whistle-blower's complaint is centered around, set a quid pro quo of millions in military aid in exchange for an investigation into Biden's son, Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nTrump released a transcript of the call the day after Pelosi launched the impeachment inquiry.", "description": "Mitch McConnell pledged in a new campaign advertisement that he would put an end to the impeachment inquiry against the president should it reach the Senate.", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/15/19362654-0-image-a-13_1570371604468.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
