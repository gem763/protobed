(Getty Images)\n\nSitting in the visiting team dugout in St. Louis\u2019 Busch Stadium, San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy says that Mike Yastrzemski is a troublemaker in the clubhouse.\n\nVery quickly, however, he reneges on that statement. There\u2019s a national reporter with a tape recorder and national reporters might not be around the team enough to know right away that he is self-evidently kidding. The joke is: the 29-year-old rookie with the famous last name is actually a \u201cvery nice young man\u201d who is serious, humble and perfectly professional. By all accounts, he has always been like this.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIn high school, he must\u2019ve had friends on the team. Pat Yanchus, the former St. John\u2019s Prep baseball coach, is sure of it. But Yanchus can\u2019t remember any examples of Yastrzemski joking around back then.\n\n\u201cI think he preferred to be in the batting cages.\u201d\n\nThroughout six years in the Orioles\u2019 minor league system, as he moved up and then down again, as his peers moved past him and enjoyed their call to the show, he never let on that he was getting discouraged. And whenever Brian Graham, then the Orioles farm director, had to deliver bad news, Yastrzemski unfailingly \u201chandled it like a pro and went and did a great job wherever he was.\u201d\n\nThis probably makes him a fantastic teammate, pupil, son, new husband and representative of the family name now that Hall of Famer and hometown hero Carl has largely receded from the public sphere. It would not make for the most interesting profile subject. Except, of course, for that last name and the fact that it will be taking the field at Fenway Park on Tuesday.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen I talk to Yastrzemski, I\u2019m preemptively self-conscious of this context. This is not a useful trait for a reporter, but I worry that it seems craven or at least tiresomely obvious to have come all the way here to ask him not about how a 14th-rounder drafted out of college who couldn\u2019t break into the bigs with the Orioles is now 17 percent better than the league average hitter by OPS+, but instead whether he ever got starstruck by own grandfather. (He did not.)\n\nFor his part, though, the younger Yastrzemski seems completely at ease with having his own his success inevitably be compared to that of one of baseball\u2019s best, and with a lifetime of media coverage that refuses to separate the two.\n\nAnd when did you start getting tired of people asking you about Carl? I say, hoping it will make the interview feel looser, and maybe even conspiratorial.\n\n\u201cStill haven\u2019t,\u201d he replies.\n\nIt\u2019s the polite and even savvy answer. But for whatever it\u2019s worth, it seems true. And why wouldn\u2019t it be? He\u2019s had his whole life to get used to being a Yastrzemski.\n\n\u2018This is supposed to be fun\u2019\n\nOnly once has Anne Marie Yastrzemski seen her son sag a little under the weight of that long last name and what it means in the world of baseball. She was driving him back from Connecticut, where they had been at one of the few showcases he attended as a high schooler. Maybe there was something genetic about his predisposition to love the sport but Anne Marie had been careful to keep it all fun and games \u2014 no travel ball, few showcases like this one, no pressure to secure a scholarship \u2014 ever since he started hitting pingpong balls out of the crib with his toothbrush at 18 months old. He really did that, and you should have seen it. She would have taken a video, but she had her hands full making sure the baby didn\u2019t swallow one of the pingpong balls. So anyway, there they are driving home to Andover, Massachusetts, and Mike, now a teenager, won\u2019t stop crying.\n\nBut first, the backstory:\n\nAnne Marie Wesson and Carl Michael Yastrzemski Jr., the Hall Of Famer\u2019s son who went by Michael, met before she was old enough to remember. The Red Sox star and his then-wife, Carol, befriended Wesson\u2019s parents through her uncle, a priest at Merrimack College, where Carl ended up getting his degree. The couples would play bridge together and, as Anne Marie tells it, the kids were probably just thrown in the crib together.\n\n\u201cThere was one girl in my family for every kid that they had. They could match these kids up and get them out of their hair, basically,\u201d she says now.\n\nFor Anne Marie and Michael, at least, that worked. They married while he was pursuing a baseball career of his own, but by the time their son was born he had given up the dream, topping out at Triple-A.\n\nWhen the youngest Yastrzemski was 6, his parents divorced. Anne Marie took Mike and moved back to the Boston area near her family, and near people who knew the last name from the newspapers but also from their neighbors. If anyone treated him differently, Mike didn\u2019t notice and Anne Marie didn\u2019t either. He grew up playing Little League, begging his mom for a puppy, skipping school to go get BBQ chicken sandwiches with his maternal grandfather, golfing and goofing around with his dad who had returned to the area as well. And, OK, fine, celebrating his birthday at Fenway Park.\n\nMike was 14 when his dad died of a heart attack that occurred as a complication following hip surgery. They had always had a chaotic chemistry together, a crazy amount of silly energy, according to Anne Marie.\n\n\u201cThey packed a lot into early on in life cause maybe they both knew they had to get it all in,\u201d she says.\n\nBaseball had brought them even closer together in the final few years. \u201cHe helped me really understand the nuances of the game and how to be a hard worker and how to actually work at my craft,\u201d Yastrzemski says.\n\nAnne Marie\u2019s father went to find Mike when they got the news. The eighth-grader had gone downtown with some friends after school and his mom worried he would learn of his father\u2019s passing from someone on TV or the radio talking about how Carl Michael Yastrzemski Jr. was dead at 43. That was right around the time that Mike started to realize his grandfather meant something special to people in Massachusetts.\n\nMike Yastrzemski sits with his Hall of Fame grandfather, Carl, as a child. (Photo courtesy Anne Marie Yastrzemski)\n\n\u201cPeople would ask me about it, and I never really put it together,\u201d Yastrzemski says of growing up with a famous grandfather. \u201cWhen I got enough older to understand personalities and how people acted differently around him, then I started to notice the way their eyes lit up, the way they couldn\u2019t even talk to him normally the way they would talk to anyone else. I would see people\u2019s jaws quivering when they tried to talk to him. It was crazy.\u201d\n\nTo his grandson, though, Carl was a sometimes coach who reminded him to keep his head down through his whole swing. \u201cRelax, relax, relax, attack,\u201d the 18-time All Star would advise.\n\nIt didn\u2019t pay off right away. As a freshman at the baseball powerhouse St. John\u2019s Prep, Mike tried out for the varsity team but didn\u2019t make it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had more talented players at that age,\u201d his coach Yanchus remembers.\n\nBut Mike worked hard, loved the game, had a no-nonsense intensity despite his small frame. Sophomore summer, Anne Marie took him to the showcase in Connecticut.\n\n\u201cAnd he had to wear his name on the back of his shirt so people were kind of recognizing him,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t do as well as he wanted to, and he was upset the whole way home.\u201d\n\nFinally, she pulled the car over and turned to him. \u201cIf you don\u2019t stop crying, I\u2019m never taking you to another baseball game, ever again, because this is supposed to be fun and this is not fun. You are way too hard on yourself.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s it: That\u2019s the whole story of the one time that Mike Yastrzemski let Carl Yastrzemski\u2019s legacy loom large over his own path in baseball.\n\n\u2018Bloodlines mean a lot\u2019\n\nWhich is not to say that everything that has happened to the younger Yastrzemski since then did so irrespective of his name. And I wouldn\u2019t believe it if he tried to tell me otherwise. But still it strikes me as surprising pragmatism the way he is able to simultaneously appreciate and disregard Boston drafting him in the 36th round out of high school.\n\n\u201cI knew it was a cool gesture, essentially, by the Red Sox. I never took it seriously. I was like, that\u2019s really cool of them to do, great story; but I\u2019m going to college regardless.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t sound bitter when he says that. And he certainly isn\u2019t starstruck \u2014 not by Carl, of course, but not by the Red Sox either. He\u2019s worn the uniform, played on Fenway\u2019s field as part of local tournaments and the Cape Cod Baseball League.\n\nMike Yastrzemski warms up at Fenway Park. (Photo courtesy Anne Marie Yastrzemski)\n\nSo he went to Vanderbilt University. Got a good education and a great baseball experience. Got good at it, too. His senior year, the team set an SEC record by going 26-3, with Yastrzemski as captain. He was still quiet in college, still serious too, more likely to lead by example than give a rousing speech.\n\n\u201cHe obviously had this certain aura about him with his name, but he never had a big ego,\u201d says Tyler Beede, who played alongside and lived with Yastrzemski in college and who is his teammate again this year with the Giants.\n\nIn college, Beede struggled with the pressure of having been a first-round pick out of high school. He hadn\u2019t had his whole life to get used to being the object of other people\u2019s expectations. In Yastrzemski\u2019s predisposition toward dispassionate self-awareness \u2014 or maybe it was just a practiced ability to not internalize arbitrary trappings \u2014 Beede found a mentor of sorts.\n\n\u201cBeing around Yaz allowed me to keep my mindset focused on, hey this is about winning here at Vanderbilt and being the best that you can be for this team and not for anybody else. I credit Yaz for a lot of that centeredness.\u201d\n\nIt was that hard-nose, right way, gamer attitude, the sound fundamentals, tough at-bats, and ability to play all three positions in the outfield that stood out to the Orioles, who drafted Yastrzemski after his senior year in the 14th round in 2013. Plus, of course, the last name.\n\n\u201cObviously bloodlines mean a lot in a baseball player,\u201d former Orioles farm director Graham says. \u201cI think that the draft pick itself was [former Orioles GM] Dan Duquette\u2019s idea because Dan was in Boston and friends with his grandfather. And I think that\u2019s part of the decision-making process in drafting Mike.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: Yastrzemski knows this, or at least suspects some version of it. He speculates that at the very least, at some point, he\u2019s been given a second chance, that there was a conversation behind the scenes in which the elephant in the room advocated for him without his knowledge. It doesn\u2019t make him smug to understand what is surely reality, but it hasn\u2019t given him a chip on his shoulder, either.\n\n\u201cThat would be a scenario where I would obviously be grateful,\u201d he says. \u201cAs long as you take advantage of any opportunity that you\u2019re given, you don\u2019t take it for granted, you don\u2019t act like a jerk about it, or you don\u2019t act like you really deserve anything different than anyone else, then it\u2019s just circumstantial.\u201d\n\nGetting his break\n\nRiding the bus between Triple-A games in Norfolk, Virginia, and Gwinnett, Georgia, after six years of similarly bleak bus rides, while your 20s and your teammates pass you by, is enough to make anyone think about quitting baseball.\n\n\u201cOnce I started bouncing back and forth between Double-A and Triple-A, feeling like I was getting kind of jerked around a little bit, I felt like, this is not where I envisioned my career going. This is not how I thought it would happen. This isn\u2019t what I signed up for, this isn\u2019t what I wanted to do,\u201d Yastrzemski says.\n\nHe\u2019d call his now-wife Paige and she would echo the same sentiment that Anne Marie stopped the car for back in high school: If your heart\u2019s not in it, don\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t force yourself to be miserable.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s when I realized how much I did love baseball because as hard as it gets, as hard as the road may have been, it still wasn\u2019t worth giving it up because I love playing that much.\u201d\n\nOne trade to the Giants organization later and Yastrzemski got his break.\n\n(His mom had already boarded a flight to Florida to visit him in the Grapefruit League when he called her to say he was off to spring training in Arizona; she was asleep when he called to tell her he\u2019d made it to the majors.)\n\nSan Francisco Giants right fielder Mike Yastrzemski doubles in the seventh inning during a Major League Baseball game against the St. Louis Cardinals on Sept. 4, 2019, at Busch Stadium in St. Louis. (Getty Images)\n\nWhich is how Yastrzemski found himself joking around with his big-league teammates in the dugout before an early September game in St. Louis. Yastrzemski claims that the famously cavernous Oracle Park in San Francisco is his favorite place to play.\n\n\u201cI just look where the wind is blowing and aim there,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s blowing in, I foul it back 100 times.\u201d\n\nThat night Yastrzemski hits his 19th home run of the incomplete season, more than he\u2019s ever had any level. It wasn\u2019t the wind that carried it out, but the state of the baseball probably gave it a few extra feet. He\u2019s a disciplined batter with versatile defense and a veteran\u2019s presence in the clubhouse, but until this year, Mike Yastrzemski never really had the power. This doesn\u2019t diminish what he\u2019s done in his rookie campaign \u2014 it\u2019s just circumstantial.\n\nThe thing that surprised Yastrzemski the most about making it to the majors was how normal everyone here is. \u201cYou look up to big leaguers, especially remembering my thoughts of watching guys play in the big leagues and thinking that they\u2019re legitimately superhuman,\u201d he says.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty ironic if you think about it: Carl Yastrzemski\u2019s grandson marveling that big leaguers are just people, too. Sometimes, you have to see it for yourself.\n\nFenway prestige\n\nAt least 150 friends and family have purchased tickets to see the younger Yastrzemski play at Fenway this week. He\u2019s read that his grandfather expects to be emotional, and hasn\u2019t ever really seen that before. \u201cSo that\u2019ll be interesting.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019ll miss his dad, like he does every day because you don\u2019t get used to losing someone so close to you. But not as much as he did on his wedding day this offseason.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it feels more or less special to run out on to your hometown field for the first time at 29 having already exceeded expectations than it does to play there for 23 years as a perennial All-Star. But neither does Mike Yastrzemski. That\u2019s not how lives and experiences work.\n\nThe fanfare and the media circus surrounding a mid-September series between two teams that will both miss the playoffs is because of the last name, because of Carl Yastrzemski. But there are no empty gestures here like burning a draft pick on a kid who\u2019s going to college anyway. Getting his name in a major-league lineup on a daily basis? That\u2019s all Mike.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Returning to the home of his Hall of Famer grandfather Carl Yastrzemski, a 29-year-old Giants rookie has clawed out his own success.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lYFbkMtWwZChFjlXZ5_cKg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6te6ODPKpgvsUGonVrs3Kg--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/97abec80-d962-11e9-b633-4ae3e6c7fbc1", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
