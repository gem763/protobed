Today Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced via tweetstorm that the company has \u201cmade the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally\u201d because Twitter believes \u201cmessage reach should be earned, not bought.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally. We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought. Why? A few reasons\u2026\ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 jack \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0e (@jack) October 30, 2019\n\nDorsey basically says that a political meassage should earn its reach honestly; either by following an account or retweeting. Ad payments are highly optimized and targeted, compromising the element of choice. Moreover, internet ads specifically introduce specific challenges:\n\nInternet political ads present entirely new challenges to civic discourse: machine learning-based optimization of messaging and micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and deep fakes. All at increasing velocity, sophistication, and overwhelming scale. \u2014 jack \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0e (@jack) October 30, 2019\n\nMoney also compromises how Twitter deals with curbing misinformation:\n\nFor instance, it\u2018s not credible for us to say: \u201cWe\u2019re working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, buuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad\u2026well\u2026they can say whatever they want! \ud83d\ude09\u201d \u2014 jack \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0e (@jack) October 30, 2019\n\nDorsey acknowledges removing ads can help incumbents, but he\u2019s confident political messages can grow without paid advertising:\n\nWe\u2019re well aware we\u2018re a small part of a much larger political advertising ecosystem. Some might argue our actions today could favor incumbents. But we have witnessed many social movements reach massive scale without any political advertising. I trust this will only grow. \u2014 jack \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0e (@jack) October 30, 2019\n\nThe CEO says Twitter will share the final new ad policy by November 15. The company will begin to enforce the policy November 22.
