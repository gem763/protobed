(Benoit Peyrucq, AFP)\n\nMadani, 22, was arrested a few days after the failed attack in a Paris suburb along with two other defendants, Sarah Hervouet and Amel Sakaou, who were each sentenced to 20 years.\n\nThe three burst out of the apartment to which they had been tracked down by police, brandishing knives.\n\nHervouet stabbed an officer in the shoulder, while Madani was shot in the leg.\n\nGilligmann was arrested in southern France.\n\nA fifth woman, Samia Chalel, was also tried for allegedly helping hide Madani. She was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nThe court heard how Madani posed as a male jihadist online to try recruit women for IS and won over Gilligmann in messages exchanged online.\n\nMadani's lawyers described her as a lonely young woman with half-baked attack plans and a death wish - a far cry from the prosecution's characterisation of a determined gang of would-be killers.\n\nMadani told the court on Monday she regretted her actions.\n\n\"At the time all my plans involved death. Today, my plans are about life,\" she said.\n\nGilligmann, a married mother of three, spoke emotionally of the \"shame\" she had brought on her family and asked for forgiveness from the victims of terrorism.\n\nHer lawyers argued she had acted out of love for a fictitious jihadist named Abou Junayd, for whom she left her husband.", "description": "A French court has sentenced five members of an all-female jihadist cell to between five and 30 years in prison over a failed bid to detonate a car bomb outside Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7934/a2779dab56b846fab0f5038b8aefa31f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
