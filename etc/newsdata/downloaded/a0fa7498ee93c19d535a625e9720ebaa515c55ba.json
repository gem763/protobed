But instead, the voyage has reportedly turned into a \u201cnightmare\u201d with many demanding their money back.\n\nSetting sail on September 27, the luxurious cruise liner departed Southampton in England for a stunning adventure that would take passengers to ports in France, Amsterdam, Norway and Iceland.\n\nBut instead, some passengers said \u201call hell broke loose\u201d within moments of boarding the ship, with management making changes to the itinerary before the cruise departed the first port.\n\nmedia_camera The Norwegian Spirit cruise ship had 2000 passengers on-board.\n\n\u201cThe first port was supposed to be Amsterdam,\u201d a passenger told Cruise Radio. \u201cBut they cancelled it before we boarded and switched it to Le Havre.\u201d\n\nPassengers became even more outraged when the high winds on their sailing route prevented the vessel from docking at other ports, including the new destination of Le Havre.\n\n\u201cIt really was bad,\u201d the guest said.\n\nmedia_camera Footage shows hundreds of passengers protesting in the ship's grand atrium amid chants of \u2018shame on you\u2019, \u2018we want refunds\u2019 and \u2018get us off this ship\u2019.\n\n\u201cThen, after stops in Bergen and Flam, they announced they were not going to make it to (our next port of call in) Iceland because they felt they might catch Hurricane Lorenzo on the way back to Ireland.\u201d\n\nAccording to some passengers, the ship eventually docked at a \u201cdeserted\u201d Norwegian town that was closed to tourists before moving on to Greenock near Glasgow because Iceland was also stripped from the itinerary. But again, the ship was denied access and moved on from Greenock to Belfast, resulting in three days at sea for the angry passengers.\n\nmedia_camera Passengers on a luxury liner staged a mutiny after their cruise turned into \u2018the holiday from hell\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t get into Greenock because of high winds,\u201d said the passenger who spoke to Cruise Radio. \u201cI wish I took pictures of the pilot boat leaving. It was bouncing all over!\u201d\n\nPassengers on-board took to Twitter to vent their frustration about being stuck at sea, claiming toilets stopped flushing and everyone was given three-day-old food to consume on-board.\n\nAccording to some reports, passengers paid up to $10,000 for the two-week cruise and, instead of refunds, were offered a 25 per cent voucher towards a future cruise by management.\n\nVideo posted to Twitter shows passengers protesting in the ship\u2019s grand atrium, chanting \u201cshame on you\u201d, \u201cwe want refunds\u201d and \u201cget us off this ship\u201d before demanding to be taken back to London.\n\nmedia_camera Two thousand passengers were on-board the ship.\n\nIt is understood the ship ran into bad weather caused by Hurricane Lorenzo, which barrelled in earlier this month from the Atlantic before hitting Britain.\n\nThe storm produced significant swells, high waves and storm surges that led to some coastal flooding and damage, especially along the western and southern coasts. It was the largest recorded storm to have made it so far east in the north Atlantic.\n\nThe dramatic demonstration on-board resulted in the ship docking in Belfast, with many returning to London on their own rather than boarding the ship again.\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Mail, one passenger said the trip had been a \u201cnightmare\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of angry people on this ship, and the lack of adequate explanation as to what\u2019s going on almost caused a riot this morning,\u201d the 48-year-old said.\n\nmedia_camera The apology given to passengers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a nightmare of a holiday, and now many of the toilets in the cabins are overflowing with sewage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not my idea of a luxury cruise break.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Norwegian Cruise Line said the ship was forced to cancel the docking at Greenock due to weather conditions \u201cas well as a delay caused by a departing navy vessel that experienced a technical malfunction\u201d.\n\nOriginally published as Cruise guests rebel on \u2018holiday from hell\u2019", "description": "Hundreds of passengers have staged a demonstration on-board a cruise liner, with one saying all hell broke loose on the luxurious ship.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/2f3471016809907a0d35b7f9033e2bf4", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
