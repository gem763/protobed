Merenda Wallpaper.

And yet there\u2019s still so much to do in this town \u2014 like sampling garam-masala-spiked lamb chops in Long Island City, trying on leopard-print Ala\u00efa coats in the Seaport, sipping fresh-pressed sake in Industry City, and scrambling up the city\u2019s tallest rock-climbing walls in Bushwick. (You\u2019ll find those and more in our yearly best-of review, rolling out this week. Read the fun, food, shopping , and health and self lists now.) This year\u2019s best-of list in the home and help category includes a financial planner, a green sofa cleaner, temporary walls, and more.\n\nMuseum-Quality Upholsterer\n\nH&A Upholstery\n\n800-341-8776\n\nWhen a Met curator needed to spruce up a 19th-century Biedermeier sofa and the Brooklyn Museum acquired an Isamu Noguchi \u201ccloud\u201d sofa in a slight state of disrepair, they called up Hector and Ana Barbacone\u2019s Brooklyn Heights\u2013based H&A Upholstery. They\u2019re also beloved among big design firms, like textile giant Cowtan & Tout. While this family business is known mostly for \u201cfancier\u201d work \u2014 like salvaging horsehair antiques \u2014 it\u2019s equally great at breathing new life into thrift-found footstools and mid-century Scandinavian club chairs. With your own fabric, a dining chair starts at $120, and a three-seat camelback sofa might go for $2,500.\n\nH&A Upholstery.

It\u2019s often cheaper than its traditional counterpart, but getting the perfect hang still requires an exacting technique. This is why, years after learning from her uncle how to install wallpaper, Sarah Merenda, who owns the Queens-based studio Merenda Wallpaper, made sure to master the sticker variety as well. She starts by priming the wall \u2014 her secret for getting peel-and-stick wallpaper to stay \u2014 then leveling the first piece. Her clients range from Financial District renters to artist Daniel Buren (for shows he\u2019s had at Gavin Brown\u2019s Enterprise and Paula Cooper Gallery). Merenda charges the same amount for applying either type of paper, typically $5 per square foot, since each involves the same time and labor. And if the wallpaper\u2019s tack proves defective, she will handle replacements from the maker.\n\nGreen Sofa Cleaner\n\nNYC Steam Cleaning\n\n888-245-1199\n\nBe it a newly acquired Room & Board sofa from Craigslist or your own ratty couch that\u2019s looking a bit worse for wear, calling a cleaner to hose it down is not a terrible idea. But when there\u2019s no way to know what weird chemicals are being deployed, the idea of introducing fumes that linger for days makes this solution a lot less appealing. For NYC Steam Cleaning, using effective cleaning products free of allergens and potential carcinogens is a point of pride. Owner Reuven Noiman and his staff have established themselves as experts in cleaning and reviving velvet couches or specialized fabrics like temperamental Haitian cotton. And they\u2019re no slouches: Noiman & Co. regularly attend seminars to keep up with the latest brush techniques for maintaining fabric fibers or the most efficient tannin products for breaking down coffee stains on jacquards. For tougher jobs, they can recondition the piece at Noiman\u2019s facility. A three-seat-couch cleaning starts at $190, and 24-hour service is available (albeit for a higher fee) in case last night\u2019s dinner party left something in need of immediate attention.\n\nBaby Bodyguards. Photo: Courtesy of vendor\n\nBabyproofing\n\nBaby Bodyguards\n\n718-332-0511\n\nBabyproofing, while nonnegotiable, isn\u2019t always the most home-beautifying exercise. People like, say, Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9, who don\u2019t really want to deal with sticky, adhesive child locks or unsightly plastic gates that don\u2019t blend in with the d\u00e9cor, turn to Courtney and Fred Ilarraza of Baby Bodyguards, the company that helped the Carters secure their Hudson Street penthouse for Blue Ivy. Their secret is to focus on gear that either locks from the inside or retracts. During in-person (or newly offered FaceTime) consultations, the Ilarrazas will walk clients through the potential dangers before discreetly securing tippable furniture to the walls, locking up knife cabinets, and, in one hyperminimal house with metal stair rails, adding polycarbonate panels that look like glass. The consultation and installation start at $350 for a single floor and $700 for a duplex; they also advise potential home-buying parents on making a new apartment more child-friendly.\n\nStringed-Instrument Repair\n\nBrooklyn Lutherie\n\n232 3rd St., nr. Third Ave., Gowanus; 347-987-3835\n\nThe formal term is luthier, but Chloe Swantner and Mamie Minch, co-founders of Brooklyn Lutherie (in a very male-dominated field, theirs is one of the city\u2019s few women-run operations), are essentially stringed-instrument doctors. From setups (bespoke adjustments that include changing string height to help playability are generally $85, for guitars, violins, and banjos) to fractures ($50 to $200) to complete restorations, they\u2019ll fix whatever ails your stringed equipment. At their workshop in Gowanus\u2019s Old American Can Factory, the pair, who met while working at guitar store Retrofret, have become known for their exceptional attention to detail and craftsmanship (they also build custom instruments on commission), reasonable turnaround time, and affordable prices. One evening a month, their shop hosts the Changeling Concert Series, becoming a makeshift venue for local musicians.\n\nChristopher Satch. Photo: Courtesy of vendor\n\nPlant Whisperer\n\nChristopher Satch\n\nbotanictonic@gmail.com\n\nBlame it on Big Houseplant, but about a third of American households sprang for dangling pothos and Pilea peperomioides in 2018. But tending to cacti in Bed-Stuy is different from doing it in, say, Silver Lake, which is why many in the city are turning to Christopher Satch, the former head of plant science and education at houseplant-delivery start-up the Sill. When he\u2019s not misting the 90-plus flora in his Manhattan apartment or teaching at the New York Botanical Garden, he\u2019s on call for houseplant consultations. After feeling out his client\u2019s vision and getting a read on the apartment\u2019s ambient-light conditions, Satch will outfit a sun-flooded east- or west-facing living room with potted geraniums and calatheas, for example, or a dimly lit garden-level bedroom with artificial lighting and monsteras. And if your plants\u2019 leaves regularly turn yellow or are less than lush, this self-identified \u201corchid guy\u201d will diagnose ailments via email. Rates start at $100 per half-hour, plus the costs of plants and pots.\n\nSurfboard Storage\n\nLocals Surf School\n\n190 Beach 69th St., nr. Rockaway Beach Blvd., Rockaway Beach; 347-752-2728\n\nLocals Surf School offers the best surf camps and lessons in the Rockaways, and it recently expanded to include a combo board-storage facility (with showers) and caf\u00e9 one block from the beach. Located in a sleek ground-floor space in new luxury-condo complex the Tides, the facility solves a number of traditional hassles of Rockaway surfing: hauling your board onto the subway or the roof of your car (not to mention trying to store it in a cramped apartment and get it up and down the stairs), changing out of your wet gear on a freezing sidewalk, heading back to a midday meeting with salt-plastered hair. Unlike other options in the area, the Locals\u2019 blond-wood space is ultraclean, temperature and humidity controlled (for faster wet-suit drying), and has towering vertical lockers that can hold up to seven boards. Storage rates start at $150 a month and $1,380 for the year. Electronic key-fob entry means members can get in for the earliest dawn-patrol sessions. Wi-Fi and good espresso may even help you get some work done.\n\nPamela Capalad.

In 2015, she decided to make a full-time go of her rapidly growing financial-consulting side gig, which she named Brunch & Budget. Now a typical day of meetings could involve eggs at Le Petit Caf\u00e9 on Court Street or a homemade \u201cbreakfast salad\u201d in Harlem. For first-time appointments, potential clients pick up the meal tab but walk away with an hour-plus of quality financial help. To work with Capalad on a full-time basis, the income-based rates start at $199 a month, with the option to check in monthly (from $299) or quarterly (from $199 a month); each plan includes ongoing email correspondence. Once a financial plan is put together \u2014 from cash flow, debt repayment, and credit assessment to estate planning \u2014 Capalad helps many of her mostly young clients work toward specific goals, like buying a first home, joining finances with a partner, moving to a new city, or shifting to full-time freelance.\n\nTemporary Walls\n\nWall 2 Wall NY\n\n152 W. 36th St., nr. Seventh Ave., Ste. 405; 646-837-7300\n\nWelcoming a new family member or bringing in a roommate generally requires more space, which generally requires getting a bigger apartment. For those who want to stay put, there are temporary walls. But if that brings up visions of some accordion-paneled thing on wheels, know that we\u2019ve come a long way. Wall 2 Wall NY supplies a wide variety of apartment-enhancing room dividers \u2014 seamless double French doors, sliding-door walls, or freestanding bookcases, to name a few \u2014 along with the option to customize built-in wardrobes. Frosted glass, should you want it, and Roxul sound insulation add a touch more privacy. And compared with multiple competitors, it offers the cheapest rates: $975 for a standard white wall with a door and lock in a Manhattan walk-up. Removal takes a few hours and is free for the first two years (as long as you give 30 days\u2019 notice); after that, it\u2019s around $350.\n\n*This article appears in the March 4, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
