For once, the Emmys didn't mess up", "language": "en", "text": "In a rarity for these awards, all the winners actually deserved it \u2013 which made Game of Thrones\u2019 final triumph after a night of sustained losses feel hollow\n\nGod, it\u2019s weird to watch the Emmys not screw everything up, isn\u2019t it? For decades now, we\u2019ve been conditioned to expect the worst from the ceremony. The patter would be hacky and ill-advised (hello Sofia Vergara on a rotating plinth). The jury would giddily fling awards at movie stars, however mediocre, who deigned to dip their toes into the low-rent world of television. Modern Family would win things. It\u2019s usually such a mess.\n\nSo last night was strange. For the most part, the awards went to people who actually deserved them. Fleabag won. Barry won. Succession won. Killing Eve won. Ben Whishaw won. Chernobyl won. All the shows you wanted to win, but assumed wouldn\u2019t because they were slightly more challenging than the usual Emmys fare, all won.\n\nEmmys 2019: Fleabag and Game of Thrones win big at Brit-dominated awards Read more\n\nBut let\u2019s start with Game of Thrones, which stormed into the Emmys trailing dozens of nominations behind it, and very nearly came away empty-handed. Four of its stars were nominated for best supporting actress, and all of them lost to Ozark. Three directors were nominated for best direction, and all of them lost to Ozark. Peter Dinklage at least deserved his best dramatic supporting actor win, because he did more than anyone to root this dog\u2019s dinner of a season in some form of humanity. But after a long night of sustained losses, Game of Thrones\u2019 eventual best drama victory felt a little hollow.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest You might be good, Game of Thrones, but you\u2019re no Ozark ...

A sweep like this \u2013 while once again hinting at the possibility that Emmy voters only watch one comedy a year \u2013 is a terrific achievement that is thoroughly deserved and just about validates this publication\u2019s decision to write three separate headlines about Fleabag every single day. I\u2019d question the directing award, because it won against a Barry episode that qualified as an actual work of art. But let\u2019s not quibble too much. Today the world belongs to Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and I can\u2019t wait to see what she does next.\n\nThe success of Chernobyl continues to fascinate. Not because it doesn\u2019t deserve the attention \u2013 my god, it deserves all the attention in the world \u2013 but because Craig Mazin won for his writing. Mazin, you\u2019ll remember, wrote The Hangover. If Joker wins big at the Oscars next year, as is predicted, it\u2019s odd to think that the two most critically acclaimed works of the year will have their roots in a film where Ed Helms drugs Mike Tyson\u2019s tiger with Rohypnol.\n\nIf nothing else, Bandersnatch\u2019s win helped to classify what it actually was. It won best television movie, despite not being on television or being a movie. It\u2019s useful to have this level of categorisation because, if interactive dramas really take off, it prevents the Emmys from having to create a category called Best Bandersnatch.\n\nThis being the Emmys, there were snubs. Of course there were snubs. Pretty much any time The Marvellous Mrs Maisel wins anything, it\u2019s a snub. This year its awards were confined to the supporting and guest comedy performer categories, with Alex Borstein and Tony Shaloub winning. But they did so at the expense of Henry Winkler, Stephen Root and Anthony Carrigan from Barry, and Fleabag\u2019s Olivia Colman, GLOW\u2019s Betty Gilpin and The Good Place\u2019s D\u2019Arcy Carden who wasn\u2019t even nominated in the first place. For the most part, the Emmys did well this year. But man, when it gets things wrong it really gets things wrong.\n\nBut, really, the night belonged to the giant back-handed compliment paid to Game of Thrones. Sure, you\u2019re the biggest show of all time. Sure, you changed television forever. But never forget this: you\u2019re no Ozark.", "description": "In a rarity for these awards, all the winners actually deserved it \u2013 which made Game of Thrones\u2019 final triumph after a night of sustained losses feel hollow", "authors": ["Stuart Heritage"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34abaf28bbe487f3d7568764ff13b82e927cf54c/0_85_3569_2142/master/3569.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=286ad26ab0b38f269e7a70eea19708cc", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
