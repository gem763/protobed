Google didn\u2019t say who was behind the attacks, nor who was targeted, but described the attack as \u201cindiscriminate,\u201d and potentially hitting \u201cthousands\u201d of people.\n\nApple disagrees.\n\nFriday, Apple published a brief press release that disputes some relatively minor details that Google released about the attacks. Namely, that the attacks lasted for a shorter amount of time and that they were less widespread than Google reported.\n\n\u201cFirst, the sophisticated attack was narrowly focused, not a broad-based exploit of iPhones \u201cen masse\u201d as described. The attack affected fewer than a dozen websites that focus on content related to the Uighur community.\u201d Apple wrote. \u201cGoogle\u2019s post, issued six months after iOS patches were released, creates the false impression of \u201cmass exploitation\u201d to \u201cmonitor the private activities of entire populations in real time,\u201d stoking fear among all iPhone users that their devices had been compromised. This was never the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecond, all evidence indicates that these website attacks were only operational for a brief period, roughly two months, not \u201ctwo years\u201d as Google implies,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nDo you work at a company selling these sorts of exploits?

Google's Project Zero has been a constant thorn in Apple's side, as it has discovered more zero-day exploits and bugs in iOS in recent years than any other entity. This, of course, is good for Apple's overall security and good for iPhone users as a whole, but the fact that Google continues to find and publish severe vulnerabilities in iOS has done damage to the perception that iPhone exploits are rare and that Apple's security team is infallible.\n\nIt\u2019s not immediately clear whether the hack was as bad as Google said, but either way this is among the worst and most widespread security breaches in iOS history. Perhaps going after the company that caught the attacks and helped Apple patch the vulnerabilities, and dismissing the gravity and the dangers the attacks posed to an oppressed community is not the best approach in the wake of the worst documented attacks against users in the history of the iPhone.\n\nGoogle responded to Apple with the following statement: \"Project Zero posts technical research that is designed to advance the understanding of security vulnerabilities, which leads to better defensive strategies. We stand by our in-depth research which was written to focus on the technical aspects of these vulnerabilities. We will continue to work with Apple and other leading companies to help keep people safe online.\"\n\nA former Apple security employee criticized the company's reaction and its statement, saying it was misleading. For example, the former employee said, the fact that the the attack was narrowly focused \"doesn\u2019t say anything about the security of iOS, merely about the restraint of Chinese attackers.\"\n\n\"There was nothing keeping the Chinese from putting their exploit(s) in an advertising iframe and paying Huffington Post to serve it. They could easily have compromised tens of millions of iPhones, but chose not to. As a result, we didn\u2019t find out about these attackers for years,\" the employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.\n\nThis story has been updated to add Google's statement and the former Apple employee comments.\n\nSubscribe to our new cybersecurity podcast, CYBER.", "description": "Apple says that Google oversold the nature of the hack and that it quickly fixed the vulnerability.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d72941b33bbfa000832184e/lede/1567790109058-Screenshot-2019-09-06-at-131427.png?crop=0.9908148148148148xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
