Though the party lost nearly one-fifth of its support compared with 2014 result, when the Christian Democrats won 39.4 percent, the result is better than many polls projected.\n\nIn Brandenburg, a largely rural state of 2.5 million surrounding Berlin, the AfD finished second behind the ruling Social Democrats (SPD) with 23.5 percent, according to preliminary results. That\u2019s up from the 12.2 percent the AfD won in 2014.\n\nThe SPD, which has dominated Brandenburg\u2019s politics for 30 years, garnered 26.2 percent, compared with 31.9 percent in 2014.\n\nMerkel\u2019s party did worse than expected in Brandenburg, winning just 15.6 percent, down from 23 percent in the last election.\n\nThe results, though preliminary, appear to confirm a deep fracturing of the electorate in eastern Germany, a development that could make it difficult to build stable coalitions in either state.\n\nDespite the AfD\u2019s strong showing, the far right has almost no chance of joining either of the state governments as all other parties have ruled out entering a coalition with them.\n\nNonetheless, the results underscore the deep frustration in Germany\u2019s east with Merkel\u2019s \u201cgrand coalition\u201d between the CDU and the SPD and will therefore resonate across the country\u2019s political landscape.\n\nThe Greens also posted major gains in Sunday\u2019s polls, according to the projections \u2014 winning 10.8 percent in Brandenburg, up from 6.2 percent, and 8.6 percent in Saxony, compared with 5.7 percent in 2014. Despite that success, the results fell short of what most polls projected.\n\nThe far-left Die Linke, traditionally strong in the east, suffered big losses in both states. It fell to 10.7 percent in Brandenburg, down from 18.6 percent. In Saxony, it finished with 10.4 percent, after 18.9 percent in the last election.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.", "description": "Alternative for Germany makes significant gains in Saxony and Brandenburg but fails to win either.", "authors": ["Matthew Karnitschnig", "Joshua Posaner"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1165449338-1200x628.jpg"}
