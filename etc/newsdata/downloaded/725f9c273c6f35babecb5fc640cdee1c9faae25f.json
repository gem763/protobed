A trio of House committee chairs on Monday threatened to subpoena Trump for documents related to his alleged efforts to pressure Zelensky.\n\nBut so far only one Republican in the Senate, Mitt Romney of Utah, has voiced concern about the president\u2019s alleged actions. Romney tweeted on Sunday that if Trump \u201casked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme.\u201d\n\nAs they returned to the Senate on Monday, most Republicans instead dodged questions about the whistleblower complaint or said that it is an issue for the Senate Intelligence Committee to address. Some, such as Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), cast doubt on the allegations against Trump.\n\n\u201cIs that what he did?\u201d Hawley said with apparent sarcasm when asked by HuffPost whether he believed it would be appropriate for the president to ask a foreign government for help winning an election. \u201cHe asked them for help with an election? Can you send me that?\u201d\n\nSen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) declined to say whether he had concerns about the allegations against Trump.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to talk to James in my office,\u201d Sasse said, according to Vice News. A onetime vocal critic of Trump, Sasse has since tempered his views \u2014 and won the president\u2019s endorsement as he seeks reelection in 2020.\n\nSen. John Cornyn (Tex.) disputed the use of the word \u201cwhistleblower\u201d to describe the person who revealed Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky.\n\n\u201cWhat makes you think he is?\u201d asked Cornyn, a staunch Trump defender who was previously the No. 2 Republican in the chamber. He suggested that while the complaint could fall within the jurisdiction of the Senate Intelligence or Armed Services committees, it could also be up to different parts of the Trump administration, such as the Justice Department or the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nThe reactions from Republicans on Monday underscored that even if House Democrats went forward with impeachment proceedings against Trump, the process would go nowhere in the GOP-controlled Senate.\n\nDemocrats say asking Ukraine to find damaging information on a potential 2020 rival could amount to another attempt to involve a foreign power in U.S. elections. Intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump, a claim the president denies.\n\nAsked about Cornyn\u2019s dismissal of the whistleblower as a \u201cleaker,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) responded with exasperation.\n\n\u201cWhat a disaster,\u201d said Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who met with Zelensky in Ukraine in early September. \u201cThis is a head-shaking moment for me, that Republicans don\u2019t give a damn about the national security of this country and are willing to let the president get away with this fundamental corruption.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the direction they take \u2014 attacking the whistleblower, trying to cover up this corruption \u2014 it\u2019s a really, really sad day for the country,\u201d he added.\n\nEven Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the founder of the bipartisan Senate Whistleblower Protection Caucus, steered clear of addressing the allegations directly. In a statement, Grassley chided Democrats and the media for \u201crampant speculation\u201d but made no mention of Trump.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, it\u2019s important to respect the law and the whistleblower\u2019s confidentiality while we gather the facts of the case,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cAnd of course, transparency is always the best policy so long as we don\u2019t endanger national security.\u201d\n\nLater, in an exchange with reporters, Grassley declined to say whether he believes it is appropriate that Trump brought up Biden in his phone call with Zelensky.\n\n\u201cYou know, what you\u2019re asking me, you could ask me the same question about, was it appropriate what Biden did? \u2026 You ought to ask the same at the same time,\u201d Grassley said, echoing Trump\u2019s attacks against Biden and his son, Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company that Trump pushed Zelensky to investigate.\n\nOther Republicans, such as Sens. Joni Ernst (Iowa), John Thune (S.D.), Rick Scott (Fla.), Tom Cotton (Ark.) and Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (N.C.) either declined to comment or emphasized the need to \u201cget the facts out\u201d before opining on the matter.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who sits on the Intelligence Committee and is facing a tough reelection battle in 2020, said she believes the whistleblower complaint must be turned over to Congress. The panel is meeting this week to hear from intelligence community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, she added. Atkinson testified behind closed doors to members of the House Intelligence Committee last week.\n\n\u201cThe law is clear that if the inspector general of the intelligence community receives a whistleblower complaint, that the IG deems is urgent, that that is to be reported to the leaders of the intelligence community,\u201d Collins said. \u201cAnd I very much appreciate the fact that the chairman has decided that the entire committee should be briefed, not just the chairman and vice chairman.\u201d\n\nTrump and members of his administration have given mixed messages about whether they plan to publicly release the transcript of the president\u2019s call with Zelensky. At times, Trump has said he is wary of doing so because it would set a bad precedent \u2014 an argument that some Republicans echoed Monday night.\n\n\u201cWhat about all the other conversations that the presidents of the United States have with foreign leaders and so forth?\u201d Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) said. \u201cA lot of that is not for public consumption, I would imagine.\u201d\n\nAsked whether Congress should at least see the transcript, Shelby demurred.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in it,\u201d he said.\n\nPaul Kane contributed to this report.", "description": "Some Republicans on Monday responded as if they were unaware of the matter, while others disparaged the whistleblower or ignored reporters\u2019 questions.", "authors": ["Felicia Sonmez", "Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives", "Erica Werner", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On Economic Policy"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VHUZV2G6KEI6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
