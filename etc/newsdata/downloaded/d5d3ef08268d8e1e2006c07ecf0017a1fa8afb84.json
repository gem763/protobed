Leather jacket, bandanna, attitude. Hella cool. Roaring down a street lined with restaurants with the greatest of ease. Anonymous, but still very much seen, you own that space and that moment.\n\nI recently tagged along with a group of bikers just like this. But they are even cooler. I wore the jacket. The bandanna.

Finally ending our drive at Cape Point.\n\n(Tim and Brody the dog.
