REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\n\nSalazar, who has coached some of the world\u2019s top distance runners, including Olympic and world champion Mo Farah, was banned for four years for doping violations by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) this week.\n\nUSADA said Salazar was punished for \u201corchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct\u201d as head coach of the Nike Oregon Project (NOP), a camp designed primarily to develop U.S. endurance athletes.\n\nBut USADA did not sanction any athletes who might have been the recipients of this prohibited doping conduct, even inadvertently.\n\n\u201cWe will follow up on questions that remain open,\u201d IOC President Thomas Bach told reporters on Thursday. \u201cThe IOC will write a letter to WADA in this respect.\n\n\u201cFirst of all to see how many athletes have been investigated. Have all the athletes been investigated who were training in this centre there?\u201d Bach said.\n\n\u201cDoes the report address the whole period of the existence of this project or only part of it? Could there be any Olympic results affected directly or indirectly?\u201d\n\nSalazar, who was a celebrated distance runner, winning three consecutive New York City marathons starting in 1980, has denied any wrongdoing and has vowed to appeal against the ban.\n\nBach said athletes operated under the strict liability concept which meant that whether they knew they were being given banned substances or not would have little impact on potential sanctions.\n\nUSADA said Salazar, who also coached American Olympian Matthew Centrowitz among other top distance runners, trafficked banned the performance-enhancing substance testosterone to multiple athletes.\n\nSalazar also tampered with or attempted to tamper with NOP athletes\u2019 doping control processes, the agency said after concluding its four-year investigation.\n\nThe USADA report also cited emails showing that Nike Inc (NKE.N) Chief Executive Mark Parker was made aware of experiments involving AndroGel, a topical testosterone cream that is banned.\n\nNike, which sponsors many high-profile runners, is standing by Salazar.\n\nNike has denied any role in administering performance-enhancing drugs and said in a statement on Tuesday that it does not condone the use of banned substances.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Coach Alberto Salazar stands in front of Galen Rupp of the U.S.A. in the Bird's Nest Stadium at the Wold Athletics Championships in Beijing, China, August 21, 2015.
