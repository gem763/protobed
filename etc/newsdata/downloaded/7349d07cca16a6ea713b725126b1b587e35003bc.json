On Monday, Amazon workers at the center sent the site manager and Amazon\u2019s human resources a petition asking that she be reinstated, a demands letter requesting a meeting with management about the reinstatement of a second worker, and that part-time workers receive paid time off.\n\nAn organizer with Amazonians United Sacramento, the group that formed Monday, told Motherboard that the warehouse rehired Sandra within 24 hours of their petition. Friday afternoon, the group received news via email that the second worker had also been rehired. \u201cIt just goes to show that when we work together we can accomplish things that don\u2019t always seem possible. It\u2019s been a really big win,\u201d they said.\n\nAmazonians United Sacramento announced the victory in a post on its Facebook page. \u201cWithin 24 hours of submitting the petition, HR verbally confirmed to Sandra that she was going to be rehired with back pay after weeks of being ignored and strung along without a paycheck,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThat is the power that all Amazon workers have when we work together.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time in recent months that Amazon workers have shown the power of collective action in holding one of the world\u2019s largest companies accountable for its labor practices. The organizing victory arrives two days after 60 Amazon warehouse workers\u2014mostly women of Somali descent\u2014in Eagan, Minnesota walked out during their night shift, demanding increased wages and a reversal of the 30 hour weekly workload cap. Management ended the 2.5-hour strike by promising to resolve the issues the next morning. (We don't know yet whether management has announced any changes to the workers in Eagan.) In August, 80 workers briefly went on strike at the Eagan warehouse in Minnesota over parking conditions. Within two hours, management agreed to expand off-site parking and allow workers to clock-in at off-site lots to ensure they weren\u2019t marked late. Around 75 workers at an Amazon fulfillment center in Shakopee, Minnesota staged the first ever Amazon Prime Day strike in the United States on July 15.\n\n\u201cWe were definitely encouraged by last Prime Day in Minnesota, and now seeing what happened at the Eagan delivery center a few days ago,\u201d said the Amazon warehouse worker with Amazonians United Sacramento, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. \u201cWe see we can do something similar, and it\u2019s effective.\u201d\n\nThe movement hasn\u2019t been limited to blue collar workers. On September 20, more than 1,000 white collar Amazon employees walked out of the company\u2019s corporate offices demanding Jeff Bezos\u2019 pledge to eliminate the company\u2019s carbon footprint by 2030. In anticipation of their strike, Bezos announced a \u2018climate pledge,\u2019 promising to meet the Paris Accords goals a decade earlier than the rest of the world, which workers considered a major victory.\n\nEmployees at the delivery center in Sacramento say that all of its 500 workers are part-time\u2014meaning they don\u2019t qualify for paid time off or medical insurance that the company promises to full-time workers. And like many Amazon delivery center workers, their hours are limited to 30 per week, which allows the company to avoid providing them health insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Part-time Amazon warehouse workers receive 20 hours of unpaid leave per quarter, or around two and a half shifts, according to the Verge.\n\nAmazonians United of Sacramento says that while the company has taken \u201cthe right step\u201d in re-hiring the two workers, Amazon has not responded to the group\u2019s requests to meet with management or to grant paid time off for all workers. \u201cAUS will continue to push for these demands as we move forward,\u201d the group said in its Facebook post.\n\n\u201cThis really gives us a bit more momentum,\u201d another warehouse worker in Sacramento told Motherboard. \u201cAs we band together as United Amazonians I think that we can accomplish whatever we put forth our efforts. We still have a long way to go but I feel that the sky's the limit.\"", "description": "Workers at a delivery center in Sacramento asked management on Monday to reinstate two fired co-workers, and they won their request.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d97a4fbd26cd7000a2fdad6/lede/1570219260091-GettyImages-829376860.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8370535714285714xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
