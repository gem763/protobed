After former President Obama showed surprising strength in Iowa, black voters moved quickly behind his campaign, propelling him to a nearly 30-point victory in South Carolina.\n\n\u201cThis suggests that South Carolina may not be much of a firewall for Biden if he underperforms in the first contests,\u201d said Patrick Murray, director of a Monmouth University Polling Institute.\n\nIn addition to the pragmatic question of who can win, black voters in 2019 have a full menu of candidates with different visions and styles to choose from.\n\nWarren has electrified grassroots liberals and leapt to the top of the pack as an expert on policy.
