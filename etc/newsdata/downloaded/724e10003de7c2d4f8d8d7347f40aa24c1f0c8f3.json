So are the dugouts, the outfield and the stands. Someday this might be home to a baseball stadium, but today Howard Terminal is little more than a parking lot for 16-wheelers, populated by far more sea gulls than baseball fans.\n\nDave Kaval, the Oakland Athletics\u2019 team president, walks from the gigantic cranes on the water\u2019s edge to what soon might be the site of home plate. It smells like diesel fuel, not peanuts or Cracker Jacks. He no longer sees this 55-acre plot of land as a desolate storage space along the San Francisco Bay. He can\u2019t afford to focus on what he sees here today or dwell on what the ballpark might look like when it opens its doors. He has to figure out how a stadium still might be serviceable decades down the road.\n\nGame Changer This series will examine the impact climate change is having on the world of sports, from elite competitors to recreational athletes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hopeful we\u2019re going to build a ballpark that\u2019s like a Fenway or Wrigley,\u201d he said, \u201cthat will last 100 years.\u201d\n\nTo do that, the A\u2019s are having to confront a growing list of challenges, many that might not fully present themselves for years to come. The team is determined to build on the water, which on the surface might seem ill-advised. After all, the water surrounding the proposed construction site is expected to rise in the coming decades. That means Kaval faces a cascading series of problems that many teams and leagues operating in coastal cities are just starting to confront:\n\nHow do you maintain operations in areas vulnerable to climate change? How do you sustain facilities and retain fans? How do you make it all economically viable when threats such as sea level rise are inevitable?\n\nEconomists warn that climate change will have a major financial impact around the globe, and one working paper published last month stated that the United States could lose up to 10.5 percent of its gross domestic product by 2100 if emissions of greenhouse gases are not significantly cut. The economic impact similarly will be felt across the sports universe, one that could measure in the billions of dollars.\n\nThere has been no formal study done, but Allen Hershkowitz, an environment scientist who helped found Sport and Sustainability International, notes that teams and leagues will have to account for the physical impact on the venues but also losses from the disruption of business. Some locations will be prone to flooding, some to drought and still others to extreme heat, he says, and many will have to make serious adjustments in the years to come.\n\n[Big-wave surfing: Climate change has created a golden age for sport, leaving surfers conflicted]\n\nIt\u2019s a global issue, of course, and cities from Shanghai to Mumbai are bracing for rising sea levels. While the sports world might represent only a fraction of the industry and culture endangered by climate change, the games people love to play and watch are also among the most visible, not to mention vulnerable \u2014 touching cities and venues that have hosted some of the world\u2019s biggest sporting events.\n\nMany of this country\u2019s favorite sports are contested near water. If sea levels someday were to rise five or six feet \u2014 regarded by many in the scientific community as an extreme projection that might be more likely next century \u2014 consider just some of the areas and sports facilities in the United States that probably would experience flooding: TD Garden in Boston, Citi Field in New York, MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, Petco Park in San Diego, Del Mar Racetrack in California, Oracle Park in San Francisco, plus numerous college facilities, high school fields and golf courses that dot the nation\u2019s coastline \u2014 not to mention much of South Florida.\n\nThe Athletics\u2019 ambitious stadium proposal highlights many of the problems posed by rising sea levels and some of the creative solutions teams and leagues might consider to address them. In targeting a site that the city of Oakland says sits six feet above sea level, Kaval said the team had no choice but to acknowledge the potential impacts of climate change.\n\n\n\nA rendering of the proposed ballpark at Jack London Square in Oakland. (Bjarke Ingels Group)\n\n\u201cFor us, it was just the reality of the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cLiving in the Bay Area on the water \u2014 the only areas with open land where you can build \u2014 this just became a key criteria and something we had to deal with head-on.\u201d\n\nIt won\u2019t be easy. Even without climate change considerations, building a stadium is a tricky maze of regulations, politics and legal challenges \u2014 one that got more complicated for the A\u2019s this month when Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred waded into the process and warned local government officials that relocating the team isn\u2019t out of the picture.\n\nBut if the A\u2019s get the go-ahead to begin construction next year on their 34,000-seat dream stadium, a privately financed ballpark that probably will cost north of $500 million, the team will have to dig down and build up. It will have to confront the site\u2019s industrial past to plan for an uncertain future, the unpredictable realities of climate change dictating much of the project.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously expensive,\u201d Kaval said during a recent tour. \u201cBut these are investments that need to be made or these areas will not be usable both in the medium term and the long term.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not a long-term option\u2019\n\nCoastal cities across the country face a variety of threats, but no area is as vulnerable as South Florida, which is expected to see more storms, rising sea levels, increased flooding and storm surges. While that puts communities around Florida in serious jeopardy, it\u2019s also a major threat to a bustling sports economy.\n\nThe Florida Sports Foundation estimated in 2017 that the economic footprint of the sports industry in the state tops $57.4 billion and accounts for 580,000 jobs. Florida is home to 10 top-level professional sports teams, two international tennis tournaments and two NASCAR tracks. It hosts 15 baseball teams for spring training and is home to 26 minor league teams. Plus, there are 60 colleges and universities that field at least one sports program and some of the top high school athletic teams in the country.\n\nNearly all of it could be in jeopardy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a wonderful place to live,\u201d said Harold Wanless, chair of the University of Miami\u2019s department of geological sciences, \u201cbut we\u2019ll be moving on some time this century. \u2026 We\u2019re going to enjoy this place as long as we can. But it\u2019s not a long-term option.\u201d\n\nWhile most scientists agree that sea levels are rising, many climatologists \u2014 with a better understanding of how quickly ice sheets are melting in Greenland and Antarctica \u2014 now think earlier projections might have been too conservative.\n\n[In the Netherlands, ice skating is in the DNA. A warming climate could change that.]\n\n\u201cI always feel like I\u2019m the doctor who\u2019s giving bad news to a patient,\u201d said Marco Tedesco, a climate scientist at Columbia University\u2019s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. \u201cBut we are starting to understand the reasons and the processes more, and there is a much larger consensus that many of the previous estimates were underestimated.\u201d\n\nLast month, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report noting that sea level rise is accelerating, that waters across the planet could rise by 3.6 feet by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase and that \u201cbeyond 2100, sea level will continue to rise for centuries.\u201d The report also outlined the increased risks facing low-lying areas, noting that extreme flooding events that have historically struck once every 100 years could be an annual occurrence in some places by 2050.\n\nBecause of the evolving science and uncertainty looming down the road, the scientists behind the report said they could not rule out sea rise hitting two meters \u2014 more than 6\u00bd feet \u2014 by the end of the century. Some of those immersed in the field say they\u2019re fearful of something much more pronounced, perhaps even 10 feet or more.\n\n\u201cIt could be 20 or 30,\u201d Wanless said matter-of-factly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t push the 30 too much because that just drives people to go have a drink and forget about it.\u201d\n\nIn Florida, if the levels someday reach five feet, the playing field at the Jacksonville Jaguars\u2019 TIAA Bank Field would be underwater, Trump National Doral golf course will be flooded and water could be seeping through the front door at American Airlines Arena in downtown Miami. If it reaches six feet, the area around Marlins Park could be submerged, along with Gulfstream Park and Homestead-Miami Speedway. As the water levels inch higher, more structures, more teams and more mainstays of the Florida sports landscape become imperiled and waterlogged.\n\nAccording to some estimates, up to $15 billion in coastal property in Florida could be inundated by sea-level rise by 2030 and $23 billion by 2050. And yet they keep building \u2014 condos and high-rises and shopping centers and yes, sports stadiums. Marlins Park opened in 2012 with a price tag of $634 million. The Dolphins are paying $350 million for a renovation of what\u2019s now called Hard Rock Stadium. Inter Miami FC, a Major League Soccer expansion team that begins play in 2020, is hoping to build a 25,000-seat stadium near the airport.\n\nHenry Brice\u00f1o, a research professor at Florida International University\u2019s Center for Aquatic Chemistry and Environment, called the continued growth in the region \u201ccraziness.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo these people know that they\u2019re building on the future Atlantis?\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nHoward Terminal in Oakland, Calif. (Bjarke Ingels Group)\n\n\u2018A lot of unknowns\u2019\n\nWhile Florida is considered a ground zero of sorts for dangers posed by rising waters, across the country, Oakland Athletics officials are plenty familiar with flooding issues. Since 1966, they have played at RingCentral Coliseum, where team officials say the playing field is located 22 feet below sea level and workers routinely have to pump water out of the dugouts.\n\nThe stadium has seen better days, and when the Raiders couldn\u2019t land a new stadium deal, they decided to relocate to Las Vegas. The Golden State Warriors also have moved, across the bay to San Francisco this fall, which leaves the A\u2019s as the last pro team in Oakland.\n\nThe storied baseball franchise had been exploring new stadium options for most of the past two decades, but when John J. Fisher bought the franchise in 2016, the team affirmed its plans to remain in Oakland. It was a decision that limited its stadium options and meant the team almost certainly would have to contend with the effects of climate change.\n\n\u201cAny of the sites that we\u2019re choosing from had sea level rise challenges that we\u2019d have to confront,\u201d said Kaval, who\u2019s in his third year as team president.\n\nThey settled on a former shipping terminal located adjacent to Jack London Square along an estuary, 55 acres of waterfront property in a neighborhood the team hopes it can help transform, with the ballpark serving as a cornerstone for new housing and businesses.\n\nHoward Terminal had the benefit of sitting six feet above sea level, but the A\u2019s knew they needed to plan for something bigger. The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission, a state planning and regulatory agency, requires developers to consider climate change for any new construction along the water. Its \u201cBay Plan\u201d notes that the California Climate Action Team projects as much as 17 inches of sea rise by 2050 and perhaps as much as six feet by the end of the century.\n\nIf sea level rise is complicated by evolving variables, solving the myriad problems can be just as vexing.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of unknowns around the data, unknowns around the challenges, unknowns around the risks,\u201d said Richard Kennedy, a landscape architect with James Corner Field Operations.\n\nThe A\u2019s chose to plan for the most extreme models and publicly unveiled their designs for the Howard Terminal site last November. They plan to raise the foundation at Howard Terminal four feet in some areas, building the new ballpark atop a citadel and positioning the new stadium 10 or so feet above sea level. The stadium would be located at least 100 feet from the water, which gives designers a malleable band of land with which to work. The A\u2019s envision a waterfront park that probably will adapt over time. As waters rise, that land can be molded to include berms, terraces, steps and even sea walls that can divert or block water and protect the surrounding area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much easier to adapt landscape than it is to adapt ballparks and buildings and infrastructure,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nThat\u2019s among the many design elements the A\u2019s feel make the proposed ballpark unusual and forward-thinking, including a giant rooftop park that is accessible year-round and a gondola service that would transport people from downtown.\n\nThe architectural renderings depict excited fans strolling through lush green spaces. The real impact of climate change is not visually represented in the drawings, of course. The biggest risks are unseen. If waters start hitting dangerous levels here, it won\u2019t look like something from an end-of-days Hollywood blockbuster, but it could be disastrous nonetheless.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re trying to be a part of the solution\u2019\n\nAs the planet continues to warm, scientists say waters won\u2019t rise evenly. It\u2019s not like filling a bathtub, and some areas will see more drastic sea rise than others, with storm surge and high tides also wreaking more havoc in certain places.\n\n[Extreme heat is changing sports, from the Olympics to local races]\n\nBut around the Oakland waterfront, the biggest danger might lurk below the ground, where rising saltwater could push fresh water upward. That water could be catastrophic in low-lying areas, inundating underground infrastructure.\n\n\u201cMost people think of groundwater as a scarcity in California,\u201d said Kristina Hill, a professor at the University of California Berkeley who specializes in environmental planning and urban design. \u201cBut, in fact \u2026 we\u2019re going to have too much. It\u2019s going to come up higher, and it\u2019s actually going to emerge as flooding in a lot of our coastal sediment.\u201d\n\nThe water table is located just a couple of feet below the surface of Howard Terminal, which presents several challenges for engineers, who will have to contend with whatever that water pushes out of the ground. A former industrial site, Howard Terminal is considered a \u201cbrownfield\u201d property by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which means any development is complicated by long-buried pollutants and contaminants. The San Francisco Chronicle this year reviewed regulatory documents that found the soil and groundwater there contains hazardous and cancer-causing chemicals.\n\n\u201cAs that groundwater comes up, it\u2019s going to remobilize things that we\u2019ve believed were buried and isolated in the soil,\u201d Hill said.\n\nThis is a major issue for developing in former industrial sites along the water. In Miami, for example, the new soccer team, backed by David Beckham, has struggled to get its stadium off the ground. The elevation of the land is only about 7\u00bd feet, and an environmental report released last month found that soil is contaminated with toxic levels of arsenic, barium and lead. Some of it is as shallow as a half-foot and would pose a major health risk should it be carried out of the ground by rising water levels. The Miami mayor told the Miami Herald, which first reported on the environmental study, that cleanup costs could total $50 million.\n\nThe San Francisco Bay area has an added complication: earthquake risks. Much of the Howard Terminal site has been created by using fill materials, which was not necessarily intended to support a giant building or thousands of daily visitors. In addition to being less stable, that fill could be more porous than a typical foundation, which makes the area especially vulnerable to rising water.\n\nThe Athletics say they know they might have to clean or replace the soil \u2014 a complicated and costly process. Kaval likes to point out the alternative to erecting a new ballpark on the site: The area remains vulnerable to sea level rise, never sees redevelopment and remains an unused, contaminated brownfield property.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to be a part of the solution,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nAmerican Airlines Arena in Miami is one facility that could be vulnerable to the flooding that likely will affect the city in the coming years. (Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)\n\n\u2018You got to look long-term\u2019\n\nAround the coastline of just about every country, the future involves coping with water, developing strategies to make cities sustainable and safe, bolstering infrastructure to help residents. Building a stadium fortified against rising waters might give a baseball team a nice place to play, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily solve water issues for surrounding neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about the stadium itself,\u201d said Jesse Keenan, a Harvard professor who teaches courses on climate adaptation. \u201cIt\u2019s about the ancillary transportation and infrastructure that services it. Especially for Miami \u2014 you have to have a way to get there. Surface flooding or street flooding will be problematic.\u201d\n\nKaval wants to keep professional sports in Oakland and is hopeful the city can adapt in a way that sustains baseball, a bustling populous and a thriving community. The city council must give the project a final approval, which could happen as early as March, after a full review of the environmental report. If it can survive potential legal challenges, the team could break ground as early as late 2020 with hopes of hosting baseball games along San Francisco Bay in 2023.\n\nAnd if that happens, Kaval is hopeful fans will be filing into a stadium that\u2019s built for decades to come, able to withstand anything Mother Nature has in store. The project, he says, could someday serve as a model for other sports teams, other builders and other cities.\n\n\u201cYou got to look long term on these things,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to make a huge, hundreds of millions of dollars of investment, you want to make sure it has longevity.\u201d\n\nStory by Rick Maese, design by Cece Pascual, photo editing by Thomas Simonetti", "description": "One team planning for a new $500 million stadium knows it will need to confront many of the dangers posed by climate change", "authors": ["Rick Maese"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/YFXHM-tcQpPMXCwWUumNaDEUTVg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y6JNKEW3JQI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
