(AP) - The Chicago Bears have yet to fully reveal the extent of damage to quarterback Mitchell Trubisky\u2019s left shoulder, or who will play the position against the Oakland Raiders Sunday in London.\n\nIt may not matter, if they\u2019re going to continue getting defensive play like they had against the Minnesota Vikings in a 16-6 victory.\n\nThe Bears remained vague Monday on Trubisky\u2019s injury or whether Chase Daniel would have to replace their starter as he did following the injury early in Sunday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working through all of this,\u201d coach Matt Nagy said. \u201cIf he plays, we\u2019ll be ready. We\u2019ll fire up, we\u2019ll be ready. We\u2019re not going to change much. And if he doesn\u2019t, we\u2019re fine. We\u2019re going to roll with Chase and that\u2019s where we\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nNagy laughed about an ESPN report saying Trubisky suffered a dislocated non-throwing shoulder.\n\n\u201cMan, somebody knows more than me, huh?\u201d Nagy said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We literally are going to wait for more here as we go and just see exactly where things are at.\u201d\n\nWhat Nagy does know is the defense seems to work regardless of who\u2019s playing. Without starters Akiem Hicks, Roquan Smith and Bilal Nichols, they held NFL rushing leader Dalvin Cook to 35 yards and sacked quarterback Kirk Cousins six times, including two strip sacks.\n\n\u201cOur guys stepped up, we had some guys that really stepped up yesterday on that defensive line,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cYou go back and turn on that tape and you see some guys flying around, and I want to give credit really to all of the assistant coaches over there, but (defensive line coach) Jay Rodgers did a really good job with getting his guys ready. And that\u2019s what this is all about.\u201d\n\nHicks had a knee injury and was a game-time decision. Nichols has a broken hand and Smith missed for what the team called personal reasons.\n\nUsing Roy Robertson-Harris and Nick Williams on the line didn\u2019t hurt the Bears, as they combined for 3\u00bd sacks Sunday, and linebacker Nick Kwiatkoski had a strip sack and led them in tackles as Smith\u2019s replacement.\n\nThe Bears haven\u2019t allowed more than 15 points in a game this season and have given up 17 points or fewer to their last eight opponents.\n\nThe last team to score more than 17 points on the Bears was the New York Giants on Dec. 2, 2018, in a 30-27 Bears overtime loss.\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nChicago\u2019s pass rush remains among the league\u2019s best with 17 sacks, third behind league leaders New England and Carolina (18).\n\nMack has a team-high 5\u00bd sacks and his four forced fumbles is tied for the NFL lead.\n\nLittle-known reserve Nick Williams has four sacks in the last three games as part of the defensive line rotation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re feeding off each other and feeding off the fans,\u201d Williams said. \u201cEverybody wants to get to the ball. We want to be a dominant defense.\u201d\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nChicago\u2019s running attack hasn\u2019t lived up to expectations. They ran for 72 yards on 33 carries Sunday, and Nagy said the run blocking has to improve.\n\n\u201cI just feel again we\u2019re feeling things out and every week,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit different of a (blocking) scheme but I like where we\u2019re at. I know we can improve and I think we will.\u201d\n\nChicago is averaging 90.2 yards rushing per game and is in the bottom 25% of the league. Rookie rushing leader David Montgomery is averaging 50 yards a game.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nDaniel\u2019s 22-of-30 effort for 195 yards included his fourth touchdown throw with the Bears, a 10-yarder to Tarik Cohen. He started two games and had three TD passes last year when Trubisky suffered a shoulder injury against Minnesota.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one luxury that we have is having Chase,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cHe knows the offense really, really well. He\u2019s really like a coach out there. He can fix any mistakes that I have. Even if it\u2019s just communication, he\u2019s able to handle that. He did that a couple times yesterday.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s who ends up playing, then we feel very comfortable.\u201d\n\nNagy said the Bears would consider activating Tyler Bray from the practice squad as backup if Trubisky is unable to play.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nWide receiver Anthony Miller had two receptions for 15 yards Sunday and has just four catches on the season. The Bears were hoping he would step up with Taylor Gabriel sidelined because of a concussion. Miller led the Bears in TD catches with seven as a rookie last season.\n\nINJURIES\n\nKyle Long (hip) and Akiem Hicks (knee) were close to being able to play on Sunday during pregame warmups, and the Bears are hopeful both will return. Also, Gabriel is still in the concussion protocol after missing the Vikings game. Kicker Eddy Pineiro went 3-for-3 on field goals despite playing with a pinched nerve in his knee.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n7: Wide receiver Allen Robinson made seven receptions Sunday, his second seven-catch game of the season. He has a team-high 280 yards receiving on the year.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Bears (3-1) travel to London to face the Oakland Raiders (2-2), the team that traded Mack.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait, man, it\u2019s exciting,\u201d Mack said.\n\nThen he laughed and told reporters to look elsewhere to hype a grudge match.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not gonna be no talking,\u201d Mack said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to give you what you want.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Chicago Bears have yet to fully reveal the extent of damage to quarterback Mitchell Trubisky's left shoulder, or who will play the position against the Oakland Raiders Sunday in London.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gene Chamberlain"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/vikings_bears_football_56585_c0-141-3379-2111_s1770x1032.jpg?b1fc47080fa4d955907e35b6d84f72d936363979", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
