Our most analogized president has been compared to Hitler and Stalin, Jesus, a chess grandmaster, and Julius Caesar. The Daily Beast\u2019s Clive Irving likened Trump to an early-stage Mussolini. Frank Palmieri at AlterNet countered: Trump is no Mussolini, he\u2019s Charles II of England.\n\nBut we\u2019ve seen this before, over 2,000 years ago, when another insurgent faux-populist movement whipped disaffected citizens into an anti-establishment frenzy.\n\nThe echoes of his worldview can be heard nearly a century before Caesar\u2019s rise, when Tiberius Gracchus convinced Roman citizens to hollow out their governing institutions. By the time Rome\u2019s senators realized the full extent of their self-immolation, the Gracchi\u2014and the Republic\u2014were dead.\n\nTiberius Gracchus was born around 169 B.C., a richly privileged outsider in a time of declining public trust in a divided and weak Roman Senate. Early in his life, Tiberius recognized a Roman government lacking in resolve, bound by archaic norms and customs that pointlessly impeded real progress. He would change that.\n\nOne of Tiberius\u2019 first notable public acts involved illegally negotiating and signing a peace treaty with the troublesome Numantines. Rome\u2019s treaty agreements were deeply ritualized events normally overseen by Legates, the Republic\u2019s senior officials. Tiberius\u2019s boldness sparked a scandal not unlike that of a president installing his son-in-law in a sensitive diplomatic role over well-qualified career civil servants.\n\nTiberius\u2019s stunning lack of respect for fundamental Roman values caused a shockwave among Roman elites. But Tiberius, far from the capital, had built support among rank-and-file soldiers and the working class. Plutarch, the dutiful Sean Hannity of his day, heaped praise on Tiberius first for launching and then for calling off a massive looting of Numantia.\n\nWhat made Tiberius so dangerous was his determined incitement of the worst and most violent tendencies of his populist mob. On returning home from military service, Tiberius began swinging his institutional wrecking ball at Roman politics. As one of the first leaders of the populares, a \u201cfavoring the people\u201d faction, Tiberius honed voters\u2019 justifiable disconnection and anger into a lethal political blade.\n\nNothing was stable in Tiberius\u2019 Rome. The Republic had been lurching from one military crisis to the next for nearly a century. Military life was long and brutal for Roman men, who often remained on military tour until the end of a conflict as long-running wars kept men away from their farms for years or decades, leaving fatherless families to scrape out difficult lives from the soil.\n\nRome\u2019s Forever Wars forced many families to sell their farms to wealthy politicians while continuing to work them as tenant sharecroppers. Over time, this war-forged economy funneled ever-larger amounts of wealth and land into the pockets of Rome\u2019s top 1 percent. The huge tracts of pristine farmland Rome captured during Tiberius\u2019 time had those elites salivating over the prospect of new resources to control.\n\nTiberius made land redistribution his tentpole issue. As Tribune of the Plebs, he made an amorphous and overambitious pledge to redistribute newly-captured lands to soldiers and the poor. Tiberius\u2019 Lex Sempronia Agraria proclamation was every bit as captivating among his supporters as Donald Trump\u2019s chants of \u201cBuild the Wall\u201d are today.\n\nTiberius Gracchus hid from the public a more kleptocratic reality: much of the \u201cpeople\u2019s land\u201d would, in fact, be distributed to the Gracchi family and to his personal clients.\n\nIn 134 B.C., a fight broke out at one of Tiberius\u2019s political rallies, and a mob dragged a fellow Tribune named Octavius from the stage after he stood in opposition to some of Tiberius\u2019 more extreme proposals. Modern comparisons may not serve this moment well, because the bodily integrity of a Roman Tribune was held in the highest legal, religious, and cultural regard. You did not touch the Tribunes\u2014it would be worse than punching the Queen of England.\n\nOctavius\u2019 public humiliation ignited a powder keg of resentment between the glacial Senate and a populace eager to \u201cdrain the swamps\u201d and build their new Tiberius-promised homes on top of it.", "description": "JIM WATSON/GETTYAs Americans try to find familiarity in strange times,\u00a0 people have grasped at a sea of comparisons to try and fully capture Trump\u2019s innate Trumpiness.
