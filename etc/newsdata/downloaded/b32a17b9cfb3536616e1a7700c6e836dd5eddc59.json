Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) told reporters after reviewing the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. \u201c. . . Democrats ought not be using words like \u2018impeach\u2019 before they knew anything about the actual substance.\u201d\n\n\n\nSasse, who opposed Trump\u2019s 2016 candidacy, recently has spoken more favorably about Trump and earned the president\u2019s endorsement in his reelection bid.\n\n\u201cIt remains troubling in the extreme. It\u2019s deeply troubling,\u201d Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told reporters Wednesday when asked about the transcript.\n\nAs Republican senators left a closed-door luncheon Wednesday, they were mostly supportive of the president and dismissive of the transcript, even as some lawmakers and their aides groused behind the scenes about the White House\u2019s response.\n\n\u00a9 Melina Mara/The Washington Post Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) speaks to journalists before votes on the Senate floor on Capitol Hill on Monday. Romney called a rough transcript of a phone call between President Trump and the Ukrainian president \u201cdeeply troubling.\u201d\n\nThere were scattered statements about whether Trump handled the call appropriately, but any sense of alarm was muted.\n\n\u201cAs a general rule, transcripts of phone conversations between heads of state should not be released. In this case, an exception had to be made,\u201d said Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), pointing out that some Senate Republicans had asked the president to release the document. He added that he was not troubled by its content.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a decision for the White House,\u201d Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) said when asked about the release, quickly calling out Democrats for \u201chating\u201d Trump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented that he\u2019s released it and there are some ramifications for the office, but people were clamoring for all the information, and he\u2019s giving it,\u201d said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), who attended a White House meeting Wednesday morning to review the rough transcript.\n\nWhile many Republicans continue to dismiss Democrats\u2019 impeachment efforts, the initial fault lines could foreshadow how Senate Republicans ultimately handle a trial, should the House impeach the president, according to several lawmakers and aides.\n\nIn the rough transcript of the July 25 call, Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr to investigate the conduct of Biden and offered to meet with the foreign leader at the White House after he promised to conduct such an inquiry.\n\nThose statements and others in the phone call between Trump and Zelensky were so concerning that the intelligence community inspector general thought them a possible violation of campaign finance law.\n\nIn late August, intelligence officials referred the matter to the Justice Department as a possible crime, but prosecutors concluded last week that the conduct was not criminal, according to senior Justice Department officials.\n\nTrump has acknowledged publicly that he asked Zelensky to investigate Biden\u2019s son, who served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company that came under scrutiny by authorities there.\n\nTrump has denied doing anything improper, but lawmakers have raised concerns about his directive to freeze nearly $400 million in military assistance for Ukraine in the days leading up the phone call with Zelensky.\n\nSen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) echoed other Republicans in arguing there was \u201cno quid pro quo,\u201d adding, \u201cwhile the conversation reported in the memorandum relating to alleged Ukrainian corruption and Vice President Biden\u2019s son was inappropriate, it does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense.\u201d\n\nThree Senate GOP aides said Wednesday that their bosses were unhappy with the White House\u2019s decision and the sense that Republican lawmakers were being forced into the difficult position of defending Trump while contending with what many Democrats see as a problematic transcript.\n\nBut other Senate Republicans, allied with Trump, were dismissive. \u201cWow. Impeachment over this?\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) tweeted. \u201cWhat a nothing (non-quid pro quo) burger.\u201d\n\nSen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who like Graham faces reelection next year, said, \u201cI\u2019ve looked at the transcript; I don\u2019t see anything there.\u201d\n\nOne early divide among Senate Republicans is between the \u201cBurr camp\u201d and the \u201cJohnson camp,\u201d according to two senior GOP aides who were not authorized to speak publicly, referring to Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee.\n\nBurr\u2019s faction of the Senate GOP has a darker, frustrated view of Trump\u2019s handling of Ukraine, while Johnson has linked the Ukraine issue to his committee\u2019s work into reviewing the launch of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails while serving as secretary of state.\n\nDuring a closed-door Senate Republican lunch Tuesday, both Burr and Johnson underscored their own position in conversation with colleagues, who asked them whether their respective committees would launch investigations of Biden.\n\nBurr said Wednesday said he had no interest in investigating the Biden-Ukraine angle.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not my lane, but I\u2019m only focused on gathering the facts on this piece,\u201d he said, referencing Russian interference in the 2016 election. Johnson said his committee has been conducting \u201cinformation gathering and oversight\u201d related to the 2016 campaign probe, which might now involve Hunter Biden.\n\n\u201cIt just kind of morphs into that same cast of characters, what they were doing,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers who have expressed concern about the whistleblower complaint and pushed for more disclosure include Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee who carries stature nationally in the party, even though he is still building relationships within the Senate, which he joined earlier this year.\n\nRomney\u2019s willingness to pressure the White House has irritated Trump advisers, who cheered the president\u2019s tweet this week about Romney\u2019s 2012 defeat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d forgotten I\u2019d lost, so I appreciate the reminder,\u201d Romney joked to reporters.\n\nBut Romney\u2019s willingness to speak out has \u201cgiven cover\u201d to Senate Republicans who also want to speak out, even if more mutedly, one Senate GOP aide said, because Romney is taking the lead in asking pointed questions about Trump and the administration.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said, \u201cBiden is the one who threatened Ukraine\u2019s aid, not Trump, and that has to be investigated.\u201d\n\nThe tensions between Senate Republicans who view the whistleblower complaint strictly as an intelligence matter and those who see it as part of a political \u201cwitch hunt\u201d of Trump by Democrats are almost certain to continue, lawmakers and aides said, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) having to navigate those dynamics and hold his members together amid the tumult.\n\nMcConnell faces reelection next year and is focused on keeping his Senate majority as the GOP defends 23 seats to the Democrats\u2019 12.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s member-driven approach was evident early Tuesday, when several Senate Republicans said they were unsure if McConnell would oppose the call by Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) to have the whistleblower complaint sent to the intelligence committees.\n\n\u201cI really thought Mitch would knock it down, because Chuck was putting it up. He hates everything Chuck does,\u201d one veteran Republican senator said, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t. He let Chuck\u2019s resolution get through with unanimous consent.\u201d\n\nWhen the senator inquired about McConnell\u2019s decision, he was told McConnell was following the requests from his members to receive more information.\n\nMcConnell also saw up close at Tuesday\u2019s lunch how many Senate Republicans, while publicly rallying around the president, are asking the White House to share more information. Even Trump allies asked White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland, who attended the Tuesday lunch, to give more documents to Congress, according to aides and lawmakers present.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s public message has been sharply partisan and far more predictable, calling House Democrats\u2019 impeachment moves an \u201cimpeachment parade in search of a rationale\u201d and driven by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s \u201cfar-left conference.\u201d\n\nBut McConnell is not yet preparing for a Senate trial, with some of his longtime allies holding out hope that impeachment fades in the House. McConnell\u2019s associates said this week that he has not begun internal planning for an impeachment trial, logistically or politically.\n\n\u201cZero. None. No discussions of a trial. You prepare for the probable, not the improbable. I just can\u2019t imagine a universe in which they end up doing that,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) said. \u201cNancy Pelosi is simply too shrewd to let things get out of control.\u201d\n\nAdded Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.): \u201cI don\u2019t know how they\u2019d handle it. I\u2019m labor, not management.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are looking ahead but remain unsure of whether Senate Republican support for Trump would ever crumble.\n\n\u201cAn impeachment trial would be challenging, but the Senate is more than capable of rising to the occasion, and I hope my Republican colleagues would be capable of breaking their silence and stepping forward,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said. \u201cThis is truly a time of reckoning.\u201d\n\nrobert.costa@washpost.com\n\nSeung Min Kim in New York and Paul Kane contributed to this report.", "description": "Several Republicans were stunned by the revelations in the rough transcript the White House released Wednesday and questioned the decision to make it public.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAHQupu.img?h=200&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=3505&y=1500"}
