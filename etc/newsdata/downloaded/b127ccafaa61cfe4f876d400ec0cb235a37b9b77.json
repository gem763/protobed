The Scandinavian Mixed next June will be groundbreaking, but is, in fact, the natural progression of recent moves to integrate the sexes.\n\nThe Jordan Mixed Open was held in April, featuring players from the Ladies European Tour, Seniors Tour and the Challenge Tour, the feeder for the European Tour. And even since the success of that event \u2013 in which Dutchman Daan Huizing edged out England\u2019s Meghan MacLaren down the stretch \u2013 the game has been waiting for Wentworth HQ to perform the upgrade.\n\nThe European Tour and the LET have done that with Henrik Stenson and Annika Sorenstam acting as tournament promoters in the \u00a31.3 million competition comprising 78 males and 78 females. It will take place at Bro Hof Slott Golf Club in Stockholm, with new venues for 2021 and 2022.\n\nObviously, there will be different tee positions \u2013in Jordan, the men played over 7,100 yards and the women over 6,139 \u2013 but pin positions will be important, too. The goal will be for the pros to have the same club in their hands for their approach shots.", "description": "For the first time on the major tours, men and women will play alongside each other on the same course for the same individual trophy and for the same first prize.", "authors": ["James Corrigan", "Golf Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/golf/2019/10/14/TELEMMGLPICT000137835135-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqoNNSexKcI53-HHJW8z5oHGDuA0gIlIPwVaKdZQ-fTSg.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
