Instead, the hotel focuses on providing what's needed the most among travelers -- comfortable bedding and powerful showers.\n\nComfortable beds and fast internet connection aside, Aerotel also features a gym, a game room and a restaurant. courtesy Plaza Premium Group\n\nRooms can be rented out by the hour or the day -- perfect for on-the-go globetrotters in need of a quick recharge.\n\n\"We created Aerotel to take care of travelers needing a space to rest right at the terminal with no constraint on check-in time,\" said Song Hoi-see, founder and CEO of Plaza Premium Group, in a statement.\n\nLibrary Lounge, the brand's signature restaurant, serves an international buffet and offers a la carte menus.\n\nThere's also a gym, inside a birdcage-like room, and a game room.\n\nGuests can rent rooms in blocks of three, six, nine or 12 hours -- so there's need to pay a day rate.\n\nThe group's flagship property, Aerotel Beijing is also the first hotel in the group to have two meeting rooms and a multifunctional VIP room that can host up to 36 guests.\n\nRelated content Beijing is building hundreds of airports as millions of Chinese take to the skies\n\nAirport hotels on the rise\n\nAerotel Beijing's games room. courtesy Plaza Premium Group\n\nAfter the opening of the first Aerotel in Singapore Changi Airport in 2016, the group -- better known for building airport lounges -- has expanded and now operates 10 properties around the world.\n\nIt's all part of a greater trend in aviation. Airport hotels -- either in-terminal or nearby properties -- have become more popular and more awe-inspiring in recent years.\n\nJFK Airport, for instance, recently opened the long-awaited TWA hotel , with 512 rooms and a retro-aviation theme.\n\nMeanwhile, Paradise City outside Incheon International Airport in South Korea is a $2 billion resort featuring artworks from Damien Hirst and Yayoi Kusama, a nighttime theme park and a casino.", "description": "Aerotel Beijing has opened, and it's China's largest in-terminal airport hotel.
