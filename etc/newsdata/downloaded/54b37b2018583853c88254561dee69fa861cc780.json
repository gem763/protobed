The group also declined to comment on its budget.\n\nHolt said, however, he expected his group\u2019s budget would be smaller than those of anti-fossil fuel organizations funded by billionaire activists like former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Democratic presidential hopeful Tom Steyer that advocate for a transition away from gas, oil and coal due to their impact on climate change.\n\nTEA\u2019s launch comes as environmentalists and some Democratic presidential candidates have called for urgent measures to reduce the nation\u2019s reliance on natural gas, and move more quickly to renewable resources like solar and wind power. Several U.S. cities and states are also looking into ways of curbing natural gas consumption.\n\nThe Green New Deal, a nonbinding resolution introduced by two Democrats in the U.S. Congress earlier this year, calls for a 10-year, government-driven effort for the United States to move away from carbon-emitting fossil fuels through investments in clean energy.\n\nThe resolution has become a political target of Republicans who call the plan radical and too expensive.\n\nIn its statement, TEA said such a policy would devastate the U.S. economy. Natural gas plants, the group argued, save consumers money and are helping to lower carbon emissions by replacing dirtier coal-fired generators.", "description": "A group backed by anonymous donors launched a campaign on Monday to promote the benefits of cheap, abundant natural gas against what it called \"radical\" proposals like the Green New Deal that would phase out use of the fossil fuel.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
