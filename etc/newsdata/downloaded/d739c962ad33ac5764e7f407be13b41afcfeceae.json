As soon as you get your wheel back. (Photo: Andrew P Collins)\n\nWe\u2019re all terrified of getting ripped off by car mechanics\u2013it\u2019s a clich\u00e9 for a reason. And since most people don\u2019t really understand how their cars work or how they\u2019re maintained, the process of getting a vehicle worked on can be nebulous and intimidating. But if you feel uncomfortable with something, you don\u2019t have to take anybody\u2019s word at face value. You can always shop around.\n\nEven if you have some conceptual knowledge of what makes your car run and what kind of repairs it might need, you\u2019re still at the mercy of a mechanic when you leave a car with them.\n\nI, for example, have been playing with cars and researching them for something like two decades. I currently have four that are all old and need to be cared for pretty actively to be kept roadworthy. But I do not have the skills or time or tools or workspace to do that much automotive maintenance myself.\n\n(My fleet management solution is a mixture of patience and careful budgeting, but that\u2019s another blog.)\n\nAnyway, as you can imagine I\u2019ve had relationships with many mechanics in 15-odd years of odd car ownership. In my personal experience, most are not in the business to \u201cscrew you,\u201d the good ones will be realistic about what kind of care is appropriate for a car and budget and charge market rates for parts and labour. But none are infallible\u2013some do make mistakes, and those can cost you just as much as an unscrupulous shop that will try to bill you for unnecessary work.\n\nSo how do you find the good ones?\n\nRead Reviews\n\nLooking at reviews online is a good place to start but it shouldn\u2019t be your last stop. The loudest people online tend to be the angriest, and you never really know what the deal was that made somebody sour on a shop. Maybe they brought in some ancient clapped-out jalopy that\u2019s been on its last legs for years and got miffed when it couldn\u2019t be worked on, or they ordered a $1000 paint job and were surprised it only lasted a year. (In case you\u2019re wondering, painting an entire car correctly is a labour-intensive process that generally costs a few grand at least.)\n\nReviews can be juiced in the other direction, too. Maybe a shop paid for a flood of five-star ratings from people in a click farm in Pakistan. I doubt that\u2019s a common occurrence, but I\u2019m sure some version of that has occurred.\n\nPoint is\u2013you can at least get an idea of what\u2019s out there with reviews, and weed out ones that seem egregiously terrible.\n\nFind A Community\n\nI know the average consumer is going to write this off as too much work, but all my personal favourite mechanics were found through car forums and Facebook groups.\n\nThis is a much finer sieve of vetting than random Yelp reviews\u2013a community of people who are into your kind of car will probably know a tech or two who\u2019s been proven to be knowledgable and trustworthy.\n\nIf you\u2019re not into this already, try Googling \u201cyour car + Facebook group\u201d and see what comes up, I bet even the most humdrum daily driver has a fan base and some active people who could give you suggestions on where to get your car worked on.\n\nFind A Specialist\n\nIn Los Angeles, we\u2019re spoiled for choice in car experts. Not only is this a hub of car enthusiasts, but there are just so many cars around that mechanics can thrive on a nich\u00e9. Plenty of shops say they specialise in Mercedes-Benzes or Hondas, but you can even find an Alfa Romeo or International Harvester place here if you look hard enough. As far as tracking these down, see previous subheading.\n\nBut even if you\u2019re living somewhere that doesn\u2019t have a population of six million people and 600 billion (rough estimate) cars, it can still be possible to find a mechanic who at least specialises in certain types of vehicles. Sending your car to a place like that will increase the likelihood that the technician\u2019s seen your problem before, which should theoretically translate to a quicker diagnosis and less downtime.\n\nFeel It Out\n\nTrust your instinct when you roll up to, or walk into, a shop. If it feels sketchy, just bail. If it seems OK, tell the person behind the desk what your problem is, and if you don\u2019t get a good feeling there either, again, you can leave. Based on what I\u2019m hearing from folks in my own social circle, this seems to be something a lot of people don\u2019t understand and what inspired me to write this blog post.\n\nIf you do get a decent vibe and want the mechanic to do a diagnosis, make sure you know upfront what you\u2019re paying for and authorizing. Some assessments can get done for free, others aren\u2019t. If a mechanic just needs to visually inspect something, that might not cost anything. If they need to perform any kind of pressure test or break out diagnostic equipment, you\u2019re more likely to get billed. (But if you just need to know what your Check Engine light means, most auto parts stores can plug in and answer that one for you for free.)\n\nIt\u2019s OK To Walk Away\n\nIf you\u2019re in the middle of nowhere and your car\u2019s catastrophically damaged, you might not have a lot of options and may be stuck paying whatever you have to to get back on the road and get home.\n\nBut in almost any other situation, if you get a repair quote estimate that seems high or unlikely or off, there\u2019s nothing wrong with you politely declining, collecting your car and taking your business elsewhere.\n\nThat said, you might go to a second shop only to get a similar prognosis and price, but at least then you\u2019ll have the peace of mind that the situation\u2019s been validated a little more.\n\nBut Cheaper Isn\u2019t Always Better\n\n\u201cMy buddy can do it cheaper,\u201d is a phrase so infamous it\u2019s become a part of memes in the car world. I mentioned reading reviews and polling your local car community before comparison shopping for repair bays in this writeup because price shouldn\u2019t be the most critical stat when it comes to sourcing labour.\n\nShops with talent tend to charge more money, and you don\u2019t necessarily want a bargain basement job done on one of your car\u2019s systems that could mean the difference between crashing or not.\n\nTL;DR: Take Your Time When You\u2019re Hiring A Mechanic\n\nSo now I\u2019ve told you to shop around for better prices, but don\u2019t necessarily go with the cheapest option, and essentially created a \u201chelpful\u201d guide that seems just as vague and confusing as the words your mechanic\u2019s throwing at you followed by scary numbers. Fuck me, right?\n\nThe annoying reality is that both are true: you should comparison shop, but not just for price, for the whole experience.\n\nKeep your eyes and ears open when you\u2019re looking to get your car repaired and try to enter the transaction with the empowered mindset of somebody who can just take their business elsewhere if you have any misgivings. Because you can!\n\nYou can also decline service, go home and do some research of your own, and bring your car back to the same place later if you decide their analysis was OK after all. Or just bring your car home to save up for a big job. I\u2019ve done that plenty of times myself.\n\nOf course, I have the luxury of a fleet of cars I mentioned earlier, and can usually use another when one needs to be mothballed so I can save for a repair. So maybe the best solution to car problems is just to buy more cars!\n\nThat\u2019s a joke, by the way. But I\u2019m sure there will be more constructive alternatives in the comments by the time you find your way to this blog.", "description": "We\u2019re all terrified of getting ripped off by car mechanics\u2013it\u2019s a clich\u00e9 for a reason.
