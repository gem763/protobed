Trashes Proposals to Rein in Big Tech Censorship", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) attacked conservative proposals Wednesday to address big tech\u2019s political censorship on the Internet. McMorris Rodgers has received over $80,000 from Google and Facebook over her career in Congress.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee held a hearing Wednesday entitled, \u201cFostering a Healthier Internet to Protect Consumers,\u201d in which members discussed Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Section 230 grants Internet platforms broader legal immunity from lawsuits for hosting offensive content. Conservatives and many tech experts contend that Section 230 awards social media giants too much legal immunity, which allows Facebook, Google, and Twitter to censor conservative and alternative voices on the Internet.\n\nDuring the hearing Wednesday, McMorris Rodgers slammed both Republican as well as Democrat proposals to \u201cmandate or dictate free speech or ensure fairness online.\u201d She added that \u201cthese proposals are not consistent with the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nThere have been some calls\u2014from both sides of the aisle\u2014for a Big Government to mandate or dictate free speech or ensure fairness online. These proposals are not consistent with the #FirstAmendment. pic.twitter.com/wNVnf2DJ87 \u2014 CathyMcMorrisRodgers (@cathymcmorris) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be the @FCC, @FTC, or any government agency\u2019s job to moderate free speech online,\u201d McMorris Rodgers said. \u201dInstead, we should continue to provide oversight of Big Tech & their use of #Section230, and also encourage constructive discussions on the responsible use of content moderation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should have a serious & thoughtful discussion on achieving the balance of #Section230. I\u2019m not for gutting it. It\u2019s essential for consumers and innovators in the Internet ecosystem,\u201d she said. \u201cMisguided and hasty attempts to amend or even repeal #Section230 for bias or other reasons could have unintended consequences for #freespeech and the ability for small businesses to provide new and innovative services.\u201d\n\nMisguided and hasty attempts to amend or even repeal #Section230 for bias or other reasons could have unintended consequences for #freespeech and the ability for small businesses to provide new and innovative services. \u2014 CathyMcMorrisRodgers (@cathymcmorris) October 16, 2019\n\nWhile it may appear that the Washington Republican merely discussed the general idea of addressing political censorship on the Internet, a McMorris Rodgers aide confirmed to Politico that her comments during the hearing served as a direct shot at Sen. Josh Hawley\u2019s (R-MO) legislation, the Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act.\n\nA McMorris Rodgers aide said that the congresswoman shares Hawley\u2019s \u201cconcerns\u201d about political bias against conservatives; however, she believes his proposal \u201cis contrary to Republicans\u2019 history on government regulation and free speech.\u201d\n\nAn aide confirms this is a reference to @HawleyMO's Section 230 bill. \"Cathy shares his concerns about bias against conservatives\u2026 but respectfully disagrees with that approach and believes it's contrary to Republicans' history on government regulation and free speech.\" https://t.co/lsfL9LZxmd \u2014 Cristiano Lima (@viaCristiano) October 16, 2019\n\nMcMorris Rodgers\u2019 comments on social media censorship remain out of step with President Donald Trump as well as the Americans people\u2019s support for Hawley\u2019s legislation.\n\nDuring a White House social media summit in July, Trump praised Hawley\u2019s legislation as a \u201cvery important\u201d bill to stop censorship of conservatives on the Internet.\n\nTrump said the senator is pushing \u201cvery important legislation because we have to do something about what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nFurther, a July poll found that nearly a majority of American voters, or 48 percent, backed the senator\u2019s Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act. A majority of Republicans and independents support the legislation, while 46 percent of Democrats favor the bill.\n\nThe congresswoman\u2019s comments also raise the question over whether she criticized a White House proposal, considering that Hawley\u2019s legislation would have the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) audit large social media companies for political bias, not the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Whereas, an August CNN report suggested that the White House was considering an executive order to call for the FCC to develop regulations on how and when Section 230 protects social media companies when they moderate or censor content on their platforms.\n\nMcMorris Rodgers\u2019 comments may appeal to many Republicans\u2019 free-market sensibilities; although, it appears that the Washington congresswoman may have a conflict of interest when it comes to her opinions on regulating big tech. McMorris Rodgers has raised nearly $80,000 during her congressional career from Google and Facebook. Donations from Google, Facebook, and their political action committees (PACs) extend to both McMorris Rodgers\u2019 campaign, Cathy McMorris Rodgers for Congress, as well as her PAC, CMR (Cathy McMorris Rodgers) PAC.\n\nMcMorris Rodgers has received roughly $79,600 from Google and Facebook, including:\n\n$3,000 from a Google political action committee (PAC)\n\n$2,000 from Facebook\u2019s PAC in March 2012\n\n$2,600 from a Google senior vice president in October 2013.\n\n$3,000 from Google in September 2013\n\n$5,000 from a Google PAC in November 2013\n\n$2,000 from a Google in March 2014\n\n$5,000 from a Google PAC in March 2014\n\n$5,000 from a Google PAC in March 2014\n\n$1,000 from a Facebook PAC in March 2014\n\n$1,000 from a Google PAC in March 2015\n\n$1,500 from a Facebook PAC in September 2015\n\n$5,000 from a Google PAC in December 2015\n\n$4,000 from a Google PAC in December 2015\n\n$5,000 from a Google PAC in March 2016\n\n$5,000 from a Google PAC in June 2016\n\n$2,500 from a Google PAC in February 2017\n\n$500 from a Facebook PAC in March 2017\n\n$1,500 from a Facebook PAC in March 2017\n\n$5,000 from a Google PAC in June 2017\n\n$2,500 from a Google PAC in August 2017\n\n$5,000 from a Google PAC in October 2018\n\n$5,000 from a Google PAC in October 2018\n\n$2,500 from a Google PAC in June 2019\n\n$5,000 from a Google PAC in June 2019\n\nMcMorris Rodgers\u2019 attacks on conservative attempts to rein in political censorship on the Internet has incensed fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill. Some have wondered whether she remains unaware of the GOP base\u2019s priorities or wants to eventually lobby for big tech after she leaves office.\n\nOne senior GOP aide told Breitbart News, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that Cathy McMorris Rodgers has chosen to side with Silicon Valley instead of President Trump and conservatives who regularly have their voices silenced by tech giants. She\u2019s either completely out of touch with voters or angling for a job as a tech lobbyist.\u201d", "description": "Rep.
