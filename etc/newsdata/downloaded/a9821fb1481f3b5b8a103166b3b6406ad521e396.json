The move comes amid growing concern about the unknown health effects of vaping, and days after the sixth person in the U.S. died of a vaping-related lung disease.\n\n\u201cWe have a problem in our country,\u201d President Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cIt\u2019s a new problem. It\u2019s a problem nobody really thought about too much a few years ago and it\u2019s called vaping, especially vaping as it pertains to innocent children.\u201d\n\nAlex Azar, the Health and Human Services Secretary, told reporters Wednesday that the FDA\u2019s new guidelines are still a few weeks away. Once the guidelines are final, all flavors of e-cigarettes, except for tobacco, will be off the shelves.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration is making it clear that we intend to clear the market of flavored e-cigarettes to reverse the deeply concerning epidemic of youth e-cigarette use that is impacting children, families, schools and communities,\u201d Azar said in a statement. \u201cWe will not stand idly by as these products become an on-ramp to combustible cigarettes or nicotine addiction for a generation of youth.\u201d\n\nThe most recent stats, from last December, showed a spike in teen vaping. A survey found that in 2018, 37 percent of high-school seniors had tried vaping.", "description": "As teen vaping surges in the U.S., the White House wants to clamp down on flavored electronic cigarettes.", "authors": ["Adam K.
