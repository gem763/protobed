The Lib Dems are little Europeans. Despite this, much of their own merchandise comes from overseas, notably the Far East.\u201d", "description": "Judith Bunting did not take the Brexit Party leader's comments lying down - and pointed out his hypocrisy", "authors": ["Mikey Smith", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20572780.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BELGIUM-BRITAIN-POLITICS-EU-BREXIT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
