Perhaps a family member was ill and medical treatment bills built up.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"The woman of the family resort to traffickers who bring them to the UK for prostitition.\n\n\"They are brought over in a mixtures of lorries, boats and various other means of smuggling. One woman was brought on a plane and dumped at the airport.\"\n\nAnother detainee at Yarl's Wood told Women for Refugee Women how her husband began to beat her, cut her with knives and threatened to kill her after he had fallen into debt\n\n\"I was afraid of him and I was afraid of the leaders of the gang he owed money to,\" she told the charity.\n\n\"One day they captured me and said I would have to go and work overseas to pay back his debt.\n\n\"The journey to the UK was awful. They did terrible things to me. When I arrived here a man came and picked me up. He took me to a house with other women.\n\n\"I thought I would be cleaning but they said I had to work as a prostitute. They made me have sex with more than ten men every day. My body and my mind got so sick, I just wanted to end it all.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nAnother women told the organisation how she had been forced to have sex with men who came to the house in the UK where she was imprisoned.\n\nIf she refused, she would be beaten and starved, sometimes going three days without food and water.\n\nHer ordeal only came to an end about a year later when immigration enforcement raided the house.\n\n\"I was terrified because the authorities had hurt me back in China and so I tried to hide but they found me,\" she said.\n\n\"They dragged me out and took me to the police station. Later, I was put in another van.\n\n\"It drove for a long time through the night and ended up at Yarl\u2019s Wood. I was taken from one hell to another.\u201d\n\nWhile most of the people Women for Refugee Women spoke to found their way into the authority's hands after escaping their captors, a third ended up in Yarl's Wood following immigration raids.\n\nMs Hudson echoed the Home Affairs Select Committees March 2019 concerns that \"vulnerable people\" were being failed by the authorities.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"Instead of being given the support they need, the women we spoke to were put in immigration detention,\" she said.\n\n\"A survivor of trafficking should be given safe accommodation and independent support to help them rebuild their lives.\n\n\"They were routinely being detained which is incredibly harmful for a women's wellbeing.\n\n\"It has a disastrous impact on people's mental health, particularly because detention is indefinite.\"\n\nMs Hudson said that the stories of Chinese women they had spoken to at Yarl's Wood were the worst members of the charity had heard during its history.\n\nHowever, once the detainees are given legal support and their situations are made clear to the authorities they are often quickly released, the communication executive said.\n\nThey then go through the National Referral Mechanism which determines whether a person is a victim of sex trafficking and should be given space in a safe house.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nWhile she is keen to point out that the women found dead in Essex could have arrived there for many different reasons, Ms Hudson believes the 39 deaths are symbolic of a larger issue.\n\n\"I really see this as part of the bigger problem of really hostile immigration policies in the UK which are closing down safe and legal routes,\" she added.\n\n\"We're forcing people into these situations of utter danger. These tragedies are preventable and this instance should be a wake up call.\"\n\nWhen asked about migrant women from China held in the UK, a spokesperson for the Home Office said detention was an important party of the immigration system, but must be \"fair, dignified and protect the most vulnerable.\"\n\n\n\nThey added: \u201cWe have made significant improvements to our approach in recent years, but remain committed to going further.\n\n\"We continue to explore alternatives to detention, increase transparency around immigration detention, further improve the support available for vulnerable detainees and initiate a new drive on detainee dignity.\n\n\u201cAny person we encounter who claims they are a victim of trafficking will, with their consent, be referred to the National Referral Mechanism. Their claim will then be considered by a trained specialist.\u201d", "description": "Women for Refugee Women have spoken of the awful journeys Chinese women have found themselves in after 39 people were found dead in a lorry in Grays, Essex", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20723232.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Silhouette-of-a-young-woman-with-problems.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
