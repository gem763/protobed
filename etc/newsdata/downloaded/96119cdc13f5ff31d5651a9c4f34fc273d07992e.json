That was when interest rates were still positive.\n\nSeven years later, with rates now well below zero, even Denmark\u2019s $440 billion pension system says the environment has become so punishing that it may be time for a change in European rules.\n\nHenrik Munck, a senior consultant at Insurance & Pension Denmark, an umbrella organization, says the way liabilities are currently calculated \u201ccould cause a negative spiral\u201d that forces funds to keep buying low-risk assets, drive yields lower and the value of liabilities even higher.\n\nThe warning comes as pension firms across Europe struggle to generate the returns they need to cover their growing obligations. In Denmark, some funds saddled with legacy policies guaranteeing returns as high as 4.5% have had to use equity to meet their obligations.\n\nTo calculate liabilities, pension firms use a complex mathematical formula constructed by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA). The formula is intended to shield funds from erratic market swings that artificially inflate or hollow out balance sheets. But with negative rates more entrenched, there are signs the EIOPA curve, as it\u2019s called, may not be working as intended.\n\n\u201cWhen pension funds across Europe de-risk simultaneously, it may actually become pro-cyclical: it increases the price movements, and it could result in yet more downward pressure on the EIOPA yield curve, exacerbating the problem,\u201d Munck said.\n\nThe curve is comprised of several elements. Its backbone -- the euro interest-rate swap curve -- has sunk since its implementation about four years ago, driving up the value of liabilities.\n\nSinking Swap Rates\n\nThe European Commission has started reviewing the regulatory framework around insurers -- Solvency II -- with a view to proposing improvements by the end of next year. Insurance Europe, an industry group, is urging the commission to address the curve in its evaluations.\n\nIn the meantime, pension funds have been coping by buying up riskier assets. The Dutch, ranked with Denmark as the world\u2019s best performing pension providers by Mercer, have complained to the European Central Bank about the fallout on the industry.\n\nAnd Then...\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the headache of what\u2019s called the volatility adjustment (VA), which is set on a country-by-country basis and is designed to cushion the impact of erratic markets. According to Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Charles Graham, there\u2019s \u201cwidespread\u201d agreement that VA is \u201cflawed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is something that EIOPA is considering recommending changing, but the challenge is still what to replace it with, or how to fine tune it,\u201d Graham said.\n\nEarlier this year, EIOPA unexpectedly slashed Denmark\u2019s VA to roughly a third its previous level, causing considerable alarm in the industry.\n\nAccording to Anders Damgaard, the chief financial officer of Denmark\u2019s biggest commercial pension fund, PFA, which has about $100 billion in assets, EIPOA\u2019s reason for the adjustment made sense: The new VA incorporates call options that let Danish borrowers buy back the bonds that fund their mortgages. The long-term covered bonds to which those call options are attached are a cornerstone of Danish pension funds\u2019 investment portfolios.\n\nWith interest rates at unprecedented lows, a record number of borrowers are now taking advantage of those call options to refinance their mortgages. Damgaard says the way EIOPA calculates the volatility adjustment means the very device that\u2019s intended to mute market swings has itself become more volatile. Worse, because it\u2019s \u201can artificial number,\u201d pension funds can\u2019t hedge it, he says.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really where the main challenge is for us,\u201d Damgaard said. \u201cWe have an unhedgeable component of the yield curve -- which is actually active on the entire yield curve -- and you can\u2019t hedge it, which means that the balance sheet posts are very volatile.\u201d\n\nPFA, like many Danish pension funds, started scaling back guaranteed products for retirees many years ago. That\u2019s given it a buffer to help absorb some of the shock of growing liabilities. But not everyone\u2019s as well prepared. \u201cIf the discount curve is more volatile and you can\u2019t hedge it, you can -- if you don\u2019t have enough capital -- be forced to lower risk on the more hedgeable space, to compensate,\u201d Damgaard said.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Back in 2012, the world\u2019s best-managed pension market was thrown a lifeline by the Danish government to help contain liabilities.
