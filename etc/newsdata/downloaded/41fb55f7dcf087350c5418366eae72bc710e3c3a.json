Analysts were expecting a loss of 29 cents per share.\n\nRevenue, however, rose 28% to 1.73 billion euros for the three-months ended Sept. 30. Analysts were expecting revenue of 1.72 billion euros.\n\nThe company also said Chief Financial Officer Barry McCarthy would retire in January and be replaced by its current Vice-President of Financial Planning and Analysis, Treasury and Investor Relations, Paul Vogel.\n\nShares were up 9% at $131.15 in premarket trading.", "description": "Spotify shares surge after surprise profit, rise in paid users", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9R0N0_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
