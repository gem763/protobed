We fell in love with Kelly when she covered hits like \u201c(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\u201d on the first season of American Idol, and now, Kellyoke makes us feel like it\u2019s Idol all over again. Like today, when she covered \u201cJuice\u201d by Lizzo, a song that feels perfect for a Kelly Clarkson performance. Clarkson comes right out clapping and starts into the second verse with a level of confidence that would make Lizzo herself proud. When she sings, \u201cI was born like this, don\u2019t even gotta try?,\u201d we believe it. Put it right next to her cover of \u201cStraight Up\u201d by former Idol judge Paula Abdul.
