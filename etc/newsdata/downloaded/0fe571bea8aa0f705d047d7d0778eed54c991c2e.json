REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger\n\nFor a while on Wednesday afternoon reporters and investors did just that, as they parsed the Federal Reserve\u2019s statement describing a widely expected decision to cut interest rates for the third time this year.\n\nThe Fed would monitor incoming data \u201cas it assesses the appropriate path\u201d of its target interest rate, the statement said, a softer version of a promise the Fed had been making for months to \u201cact as appropriate\u201d on monetary policy.\n\nInvestors and reporters alike interpreted the shift as a hint the Fed was ready to pause.\n\nThen, a few minutes into his press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled he was done with hinting.\n\nLeaving rates where they are now, he told the roomful of reporters in remarks also carried live on the internet, is \u201clikely to remain appropriate\u201d unless there is a \u201cmaterial reassessment\u201d of the Fed\u2019s outlook for moderate growth, a strong jobs market, and healthier inflation.\n\nPowell\u2019s statement was definitive: the Fed was leaving rates on hold unless something really bad happened.\n\nAnd then came the questions.\n\n\u201cNot to make light of it but I am a little bit \u2014 I wonder if you could help me out with the appropriate understanding of the word appropriate,\u201d CNBC\u2019s Steve Liesman asked.\n\nPowell responded, exactly repeating the phrases he had used earlier, as if to underscore that, like the statement the Fed issued earlier, he was sticking to script.\n\n\u201cSo we think that the current stance of policy is likely to remain appropriate, likely to remain appropriate, as long as incoming information about the economy is broadly consistent with our outlook,\u201d he said.\n\nLiesman persisted: \u201cWhy isn\u2019t the phrase \u2018likely to remain appropriate\u2019 in the statement if that\u2019s the sense of the committee?\u201d\n\nPowell has built his reputation since taking the helm of the central bank last February on being plainspoken. Central banks have built their reputations largely on being a bit harder to read.\n\nHe paused.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of practice and science and history in terms of how much you put in the actual post-meeting statement as opposed to what we say in the press conference statement. It\u2019s, uh ... you know, it\u2019s a judgment call. I am saying it now, so ...\u201d he said, trailing off.\n\nAnd it was on to the next question.", "description": "Understanding central banks is often compared to reading tea leaves: picking up on subtle clues that point in one direction or another.", "authors": ["Ann Saphir", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446702579&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T220", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
