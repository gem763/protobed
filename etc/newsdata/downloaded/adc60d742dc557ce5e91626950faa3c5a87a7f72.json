He\u2019s talking about new deals with China and Russia, when he hasn\u2019t finalized any of the old deals he\u2019s been working on and he canceled an arms treaty with Moscow. He keeps saying the wall is being built, when in reality Congress hasn\u2019t appropriated new money for fresh miles of barrier, and Mexico is certainly not paying for it. He compares his business dealings to George Washington\u2019s.\n\nHe insists Republicans won in 2018 by picking up a few Senate seats, and has yet to accept that Democrats\u2019 retaking of the House fundamentally changed the power dynamics in Washington. He appears to have fabricated an entire quote by his secretary of Defense about Syria, where he insists U.S. troops have already secured oil fields that are not even in working order.\n\nWelcome to the Trump presidency in October 2019.\n\nWHAT THE PRESIDENT TOLD SEAN HANNITY ON FOX NEWS \u2026 \u201cLook at North Carolina. Great state. Great people. Two races that were going to be lost, I went in, made a speech, let everybody know I really respect these two guys and they\u2019re going to be great, they both won. They both won by good margins. They both won.\u201d\n\n-- REALITY: The president is referring to two special elections in North Carolina, both in GOP seats. One -- NC-3 -- was a seat Republicans usually win by 12, and Greg Murphy won. That was never in doubt. NC-9 -- where Dan Bishop won -- was a tough race for the GOP, but it was also a GOP seat.\n\nLEAVING THIS HERE \u2026 TRUMP: \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to talk about it, because you know, the last time I took on Elizabeth Warren, I thought she was gone. Embers, you know, burning embers down \u2026\u201d HANNITY: \u201cPocahontas.\u201d TRUMP: \u2026 \u201cand -- Pocahontas. There\u2019s only one, and it\u2019s not her. So what happened, Sean -- and she rose from the ashes, and I give her credit for that, but I don\u2019t like talking about it.\u201d\n\nHOW THE PRESIDENT SEES IMPEACHMENT POLITICS -- TRUMP: \u201cSo everybody tells me it\u2019s going to be great for us as a Republican Party, if they actually impeach me, because the 40 seats -- and there were many more than the 32 -- it\u2019s 40, 45 seats, where I won or did really well or very close, that those people are going to get hammered -- meaning running in Congress.\u201d\n\nA NEW NUCLEAR PACT? \u2026 \u201cI believe that we\u2019re going to get together with Russia and with China, and we\u2019re going to work out our nuclear pact so that we don\u2019t all continue with this craziness. Right now we have the most powerful nuclear force in the world. Russia is second and China is third.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very costly and very dangerous. It\u2019s very, very dangerous. And we are discussing with Russia, and we\u2019re discussing with China. During the recent trade deal with China, I said, we should all get together and work out something -- a cap, have a cap. We don\u2019t need 10,000 weapons, have a cap. And I will say China and Russia are talking about it. Our experience, I\u2019m very excited about it.\u201d\n\nTHE BIG PICTURE: America is doing \u201ca great job\u201d generally, he is doing \u201ca great job running the country,\u201d the \u201chead of China\u201d congratulated the president \u201con the incredible job\u201d and the \u201cjob you\u2019ve done with the economy,\u201d his staff came to Washington \u201cto do a great job on health care, on this, on that -- on all sorts of things,\u201d America has \u201cgreat stock markets\u201d and the U.S. is doing \u201cgreat -- we\u2019re beating everybody.\u201d \u2026\n\n\u2026 America is making \u201cthe most sophisticated weapons ever made. We\u2019re making the greatest missiles, the greatest rockets, the greatest everything ever made.\u201d\n\nREAD WAPO\u2019S JOSH DAWSEY on Monday\u2019s free-wheeling, 71-minute Cabinet meeting \u201cthat was part news conference, part stream-of-consciousness bragging and all about Trump\u201d: \u201cTrump\u2019s Cabinet meetings have become about everything but the business of his Cabinet\u201d\n\n-- The official W.H. transcript was 13,022 words (hat tip: WaPo\u2019s Seung Min Kim)\n\nGood Tuesday morning, and happy World Series opening day.

But as conversations among influential Democrats often go these days, the meeting quickly evolved into a discussion of who was not in the race \u2014 but could be lured in.\n\n\u201cWould Hillary Clinton get in, the contributors wondered, and how about Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor? One person even mused whether Michelle Obama would consider a late entry, according to two people who attended the event, which was hosted by the progressive group American Bridge. \u2026\n\n\u201cMrs. Clinton and Mr. Bloomberg have both told people privately in recent weeks that if they thought they could win, they would consider entering the primary \u2014 but that they were skeptical there would be an opening, according to Democrats who have spoken with them.\n\n\u201cFormer Secretary of State John F. Kerry, who associates say has wondered aloud about whether he should have run and has found it hard to watch Mr. Biden\u2019s missteps, has also been urged to get in. But he still thinks the former vice president, who was once his longtime Senate colleague, is the party\u2019s best nominee.\n\n\u201cAnother Obama administration official who weighed a campaign at the start of the year, former Attorney General Eric Holder, is considering a last-minute entry but has conceded it may be too late, according to a Democrat familiar with his thinking. [Sen. Sherrod] Brown, who nearly entered the race earlier this year, said the pressure on him to reconsider from labor leaders, Democratic officials and donors has \u2018become more frequent.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor, who also weighed a campaign run before deciding not to, said he too has been nudged by friends to reconsider. \u2018It\u2019s nice to be rumored about,\u2019 he said, before notably refusing to rule out a last-minute entry. \u2018Don\u2019t ask me that question,\u2019 he said.\u201d NYT\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

AP preview\n\n-- \u201cHouse Democrats zero in on \u2018abuse of power\u2019 in Trump impeachment inquiry,\u201d by NBC\u2019s Heidi Przybyla\n\nTRUMP\u2019S UKRAINE BUGABOO -- NYT\u2019S PETER BAKER and NICK FANDOS: \u201cHungary\u2019s Orban Gave Trump Harsh Analysis of Ukraine Before Key Meeting\u201d: \u201cJust 10 days before a key meeting on Ukraine, President Trump met, over the objections of his national security adviser, with one of the former Soviet republic\u2019s most virulent critics, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, and heard a sharp assessment that bolstered his hostility toward the country, according to several people informed about the situation.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump\u2019s conversation with Mr. Orban on May 13 exposed him to a harsh indictment of Ukraine at a time when his personal lawyer was pressing the new government in Kiev to provide damaging information about Democrats. Mr. Trump\u2019s suspicious view of Ukraine set the stage for events that led to the impeachment inquiry against him.\u201d NYT\n\n-- THE POST\u2019S VERSION, by Greg Miller, Greg Jaffe, John Hudson and Ellen Nakashima: \u201cPutin and Hungary\u2019s Orban helped sour Trump on Ukraine\u201d\n\n-- CNN\u2019S MANU RAJU and JEREMY HERB: \u201cDemocrats see impeachment proceedings taking longer than some initially expected\u201d\n\nFOR YOUR RADAR -- \u201cPentagon draws up plans for quick Afghanistan withdrawal in case Trump blindsides military,\u201d by NBC\u2019s Carol Lee and Courtney Kube: \u201cThe Pentagon recently began drawing up plans for an abrupt withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Afghanistan in case President Donald Trump surprises military leaders by ordering an immediate drawdown as he did in Syria, three current and former defense officials said.\n\n\u201cThe contingency planning is ongoing, the officials said, and includes the possibility that Trump orders all U.S. troops out of Afghanistan within weeks. Officials cautioned, however, that the planning is a precaution and there is currently no directive from the White House to pull U.S. troops out of Afghanistan. One of the officials called it \u2018prudent planning.\u2019\u201d NBC\n\nA message from Google: Searches on Google for \u201cdrug drop off near me\u201d or \u201cmedication disposal near me\u201d now show permanent drop-off locations near you on Google Maps.\n\nTHE MULVANEY PILE-ON CONTINUES \u2026 \u201cRepublicans rip Mick Mulvaney\u2019s \u2018rough patch,\u2019\u201d by Burgess Everett and Marianne LeVine: \u201cFighting for President Donald Trump is one thing. But Republicans aren\u2019t eager to defend a struggling White House chief of staff they\u2019ve never really loved. Mick Mulvaney\u2019s two stumbling public appearances over the past week have deepened the president\u2019s Ukraine scandal, undercut a chief GOP talking point and left the party stunned and frustrated as Republican lawmakers look to hold off Democrats\u2019 impeachment drive.\n\n\u201cAs Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the most senior GOP senator, put it: Mulvaney is \u2018probably somebody that didn\u2019t know what they were talking about.\u2019 It\u2019s been a \u2018tough week\u2019 and \u2018rough patch for Mick Mulvaney\u2019 that has not aided his credibility, said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) bluntly.\n\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s hard to figure out what led him to make some of those statements last week, both in the initial news conference and then the follow-up. I\u2019m glad they walked some of that stuff back but yeah, it\u2019s hard to explain,\u2019 Thune said in an interview. \u2018He\u2019s trying to make amends and correct the record, so to speak, so we\u2019ll see. Ultimately he serves at the pleasure of the president.\u2019\u201d POLITICO\n\n2020 WATCH -- ALEX ISENSTADT: \u201cTrump dives into red-state races to reverse impeachment slump\u201d: \u201cDonald Trump is going all-in on a trio of Southern governor\u2019s races in November, gambling that a clean sweep will help him regain his political footing at the most perilous moment of his presidency.\n\n\u201cTrump is expected to barnstorm Kentucky, Mississippi, and Louisiana over the next few weeks, while dispatching prominent supporters to help in each contest. And Vice President Mike Pence is planning a bus tour through eastern Kentucky, a pivotal area on the state\u2019s political map that could decide the fate of Republican Gov. Matt Bevin.\n\n\u201cTrump badly needs a boost right now, and the White House sees the elections in the conservative states as the best near-term hope of achieving it. With the impeachment inquiry intensifying and congressional Republicans increasingly vocal in their criticism of the president, the elections give Trump the opportunity to demonstrate his political strength and shift a narrative that\u2019s turned sharply against him.\n\n\u201cBut the offensive isn\u2019t without risk: Though all three races are in Trump-friendly states, Democrats have a decent shot in at least two of them. A Republican loss in any of the elections could give the president\u2019s detractors ammunition to argue that he\u2019s politically weakened as he heads into a treacherous 2020 campaign.\u201d POLITICO\n\nTRUMP\u2019S TUESDAY -- The president will have lunch with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at 12:45 p.m. in the private dining room.\n\nPLAYBOOK READS\n\nPHOTO DU JOUR: Firefighters watch as a helicopter drops water on a wildfire in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles, on Monday, Oct. 21. | Christian Monterrosa/AP Photo\n\nTRUDEAU WINS -- \u201cJustin Trudeau outlasts challengers to gain second term,\u201d by Alexander Panetta, Lauren Gardner and Catherine Boudreau in Montreal and Regina, Sask.: \u201cJustin Trudeau will serve another term as Canada\u2019s prime minister after Liberals won a plurality of seats in Parliament. But the incumbent emerged from Monday\u2019s election weakened as his party lost seats and Trudeau will lead a minority government.\n\n\u201cThe quick declaration of Trudeau\u2019s victory came as a surprise after he was deadlocked in the polls with Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer during the six-week campaign. Still, with a minority government, Trudeau will need to forge alliances with other parties to advance his priorities.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- \u201cHow Justin Trudeau survived,\u201d by Alexander Panetta and Lauren Gardner in Montreal and Regina\n\nTHE LATEST ON BREXIT -- \u201cBrexit options: Extension or just more tension,\u201d by POLITICO Europe\u2019s Jacopo Barigazzi: \u201c Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit extension letters are in, but Brussels is in no hurry to respond. With Westminster still very much in a political fog, the 27 other nations of the European Union are biding their time before replying to the U.K. government\u2019s (reluctant) request to extend the deadline for Britain\u2019s departure beyond October 31.\n\n\u201cIf Johnson can get the deal through parliament, along with the necessary domestic legislation, in time for a Halloween exit, then the EU may not need to make a decision at all.

But amid the Democrats\u2019 impeachment push, it could end up being a coronation. Passed over for the top Oversight post nearly a decade ago, New York Rep. Carolyn Maloney could soon become the panel\u2019s permanent chairwoman and a leading face of Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe.\n\n\u201cMaloney, the panel\u2019s most senior Democrat, was tapped last week as interim head after the unexpected death of the beloved chairman, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.). A handful of other Democrats both on and off the committee have been floated as potential replacements since then, including Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton and Reps. Lacy Clay (D-Mo.), Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and Jackie Speier (D-Calif.).\n\n\u201cBut several House Democrats are quietly signaling they\u2019re hoping to avoid a messy public grab for the chairmanship that would divert attention away from their impeachment probe and spotlight long-festering fissures within the caucus. And that could put Maloney in prime position to assume the gavel, according to lawmakers and aides.\u201d POLITICO\n\nVALLEY TALK -- Apple CEO Tim Cook has joined the board of Tsinghua University.
