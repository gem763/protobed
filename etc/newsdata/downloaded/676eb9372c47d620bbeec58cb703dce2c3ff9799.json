In fact, one concertgoer captured her reaction, and we agree with the caption that it\u2019s \u201csuch a Miranda Lambert thing to do.\u201d\n\nthis was such a Miranda Lambert thing to do \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\udd2a pic.twitter.com/LEZgRYXZBQ \u2014 Kara (@karadodge) September 1, 2019\n\nAs you can see in the video, Miranda snatched up the ball, took it to the corner of the stage, and promptly popped it. \u201cI love ya\u2019ll, but we\u2019re not at the d**n beach!\u201d she called out to the crowd. \u201cWe\u2019re singing country music tonight!\u201d\n\nPersonally, this feels like an amazing power move. But some apparently didn\u2019t agree with her tactics. Twitter was lighting up with responses like \u201cyou were very rude to your fans\u201d and \u201cshe is turning people off to her music by acting so bratty.\u201d Others said ruining the beach ball was \u201cno fun\u201d and \u201ca little aggressive.\u201d\n\nyou were very rude to your fans.!! I would never attend any of your concerts even if I got ticket's FREE!! \u2014 Leticia (@rlethi) September 2, 2019\n\nI love Miranda like crazy but she needs not be so rude! She is turning people off to her music by acting so bratty. \u2014 robinraebyrd (@robinraebyrd2) September 4, 2019\n\nI feel like that\u2019s a little aggressive... it\u2019s fun for the fans to interact w each other sometimes. Unless it was purposely hit onto the stage to disrupt her performance, then that\u2019s not cool at all. \u2014 Renee Salazar (Cosby) (@NaeNae_25) August 31, 2019\n\nRich people suck....these are the fans that made you what you are..maybe we shall see if without us..what you will become \u2014 Van Ayers (@VanAyers65) September 4, 2019\n\nSo no fun \u2014 daniel freitag (@dantanna3458) September 1, 2019\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Miranda has expressed in the past how much she can\u2019t stand them at her shows. \u201cI hate beach balls,\u201d she reportedly said in 2009, according to The Boot. \u201cI just feel like people are so distracted from the music when they\u2019re trying to worry about a beach ball hitting them in the head and bouncing along like a volleyball.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s even made a scene out of destroying one before, according to this video from 2016.\n\nFinally got to see @mirandalambert destroy a beach ball in person!!! pic.twitter.com/t99DWysHTD \u2014 geananne (@Autry09) July 17, 2016\n\nSo no one can pretend they haven\u2019t been warned. Our advice? Carry a cocktail during her concert instead.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "She slashed a beach ball on stage and it was a THING.", "authors": ["Megan Stein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.7A3jnyxdd9dPz7vgeiXsg--~B/aD03MDg7dz0xNDIxO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/country_living_105/641bda314eb91b89c2c7f58116c67c0f", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
