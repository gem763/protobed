And with it went precious data about the state of the Baltic Sea.\n\nData transmission from the underwater sensors suddenly cut out one night in August, GEOMAR said. When divers went to investigate at the observatory site, they found nothing but a shredded cable that once anchored it.\n\nOne of the two components of the observatory, seen here, was installed in Germany's Eckernf\u00f6rde Bay in December 2016. Now it's disappeared without a trace.\n\nThe observatory, planted in Kiel's Eckernf\u00f6rde Bay in 2016, consists of two \"desk-sized\" racks: One acts as a power source, tethered to the coast by a cable, and the other contains the sensors that transmit data back to shore. Both were missing when divers went to investigate, GEOMAR researcher and marine biogeochemist Herman Bange said in a statement.\n\n\"The devices were gone,\" Bange said. \"The divers could not find them anymore.\"\n\nRead More", "description": "The Boknis Eck Observatory went missing from a bay in Germany.
