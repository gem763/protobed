The platform for earning and redeeming the tokens is available via dedicated EMR mobile application on Android and iOS, the report notes.\n\nEmaar chairman Mohamed Alabbar reportedly confirmed that EMR will be considered a utility token by the company. He claimed:\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t become Emaar by standing still, or by thinking small. By launching the EMR utility token ecosystem, Emaar is expanding the concept of connection. We aren\u2019t just looking into the future \u2014 we are building it.\u201d\n\nExisting crypto-related controversy over Emaar\n\nAs reported in March, Emaar was developing the token in partnership with Swiss blockchain startup Lykke. At the time, the firm said that it was also considering conducting an initial coin offering (ICO) in Europe within a year of the internal operational launch of the platform.\n\nPreviously, Emaar denied rumors that it enabled crypto payments for property, noting that it was only accepting fiat currencies including UAE dirhams or United States dollars. Per reports, Emaar was allegedly allowing customers to purchase property with major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).", "description": "Developer of the world\u2019s tallest building Burj Khalifa will launch its new blockchain token-based referral and loyalty platform in 2019", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvODQ0OGIzMDMwY2QwOTk4NDAzNDhlODQyMjM3MTdkMzYuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
