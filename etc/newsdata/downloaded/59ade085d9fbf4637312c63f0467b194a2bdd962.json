They\u2019ve got enough things to be anxious about.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to let kids be kids. We can\u2019t have them growing up as mushrooms, but we\u2019ve got to get a bit of context into this,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Morrison echoed the same comments in his address to the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday, declaring that \u201cour children have a right not just to their future but to their optimism.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must respect and harness the passion and aspiration of our younger generations, we must guard against others who would seek to compound or, worse, facelessly exploit their anxiety for their own agendas,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
