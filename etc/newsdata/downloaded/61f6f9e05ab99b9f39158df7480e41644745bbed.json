He later asks if \u201cthe animal to be sacrificed\u201d has arrived at the consulate.\n\nMutreb speaks to Salah al-Tubaigy, the forensic pathologist in charge of cutting up the body, who calmly lists the professional challenges he will face. \u201cNo,\u201d he replies to the query about putting body in a bag. \u201cToo heavy, very tall too. Actually, I\u2019ve always worked on cadavers. I know how to cut very well. I have never worked on a warm body, but I\u2019ll also manage that easily.\u201d\n\nTubaigy explains to Mutreb what should be done to Khashoggi\u2019s corpse: \u201cAfter I dismember it, you will wrap the parts into plastic bags, put them in suitcases and take them out [of the building].\u201d\n\nThis disgusting exchange comes from a bugging device placed in the consulate by Turkey\u2019s National Intelligence Organisation which has been systematically leaking their recordings to the Turkish press ever since the murder of Khashoggi on 2 October 2018. Some of the conversations were revealed earlier in the year to the UN investigator Agnes Callamard who confirmed in her report that Saudi Arabia was responsible for the \u201cdeliberate premeditated execution\u201d of Khashoggi. She found \u201csufficient credible evidence\u201d for the crown prince and his assets to be subjected to \u201ctargeted sanctions\u201d until \u201cevidence is provided and corroborated that he carries no responsibility for this execution\u201d. US officials have said that the operation could not have been carried out without the crown prince\u2019s knowledge. The Saudi government has said that neither he nor King Salman knew about the killing in advance.\n\nAs the first anniversary of the Khashoggi murder approaches in a few days\u2019 time, Saudi Arabia is desperate for the impact of the crime to fade and for the kingdom to escape the pariah status it has earned in the eyes of many across the world.\n\nThe crown prince is, above all else, eager to make sure that the murder of Khashoggi is not an issue when the US presidential campaign gets under way. President Trump\u2019s close relationship with the Saudi leader will make Trump highly vulnerable to attacks by the Democratic candidate during the election. Again and again, Trump has gone out of his way to protect his Saudi ally over bi-partisan criticism from Congress over Khashoggi, US arms supplies and the war in Yemen.\n\nThe crown prince has adopted a strategy aimed at removing the killing from the political agenda before the US presidential campaign gets seriously underway, according to a confidential report which draws its information from high level sources in the United Arab Emirates that has been published by Middle East Eye online magazine. Written for circulation among UAE leaders, it says that \u201cit was a wise step by Riyadh to move quickly to close the case and indict those responsible before the start of the American presidential election. Otherwise the killing could have been turned into one of the presidential debate topics.\u201d\n\nThe crown prince\u2019s plan is to escape the legacy of the murder by first fast-tracking the trial of members of the Saudi team accused of the killing, so court proceedings are finished before the US presidential campaign heats up. The report goes on to explain that the second part of the strategy is to close down the case in a different way by persuading members of Khashoggi\u2019s family to accept \u201cblood money\u201d and forego the right of revenge under sharia law. According to US press reports, Khashoggi family members in Saudi Arabia have already been given $10,000 a month and million-dollar houses by way of compensation.\n\nThe report is written by the Emirates Policy Centre which has close links to the UAE government and intelligence services. As the closest ally of Saudi Arabia until a recent rift over Yemen and Iran policy, the UAE is well positioned to know about the intentions of the Saudi leader.", "description": "The hideous cruelty of the murder and dismemberment of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by a Saudi death squad almost a year ago still jumps from the pages of the latest transcript of the conversation between his killers as they wait for him to arrive at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.\u201cIs it possible to put", "authors": ["Patrick Cockburn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Us.QSNIuqykpycwRBXY1SA--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/d1b0d72a1da4dfc173c8f86555997a56", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
