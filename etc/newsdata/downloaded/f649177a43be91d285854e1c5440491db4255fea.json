But if Francis accepts the proposal, it would mark a first for the Latin Rite church in a millennium.\n\nPope Francis walks in procession on the occasion of the Amazon synod, at the Vatican, on October 7. Andrew Medichini/AP\n\nThe celibate priesthood has been a tradition of the Latin Rite Catholic Church since the 11th century, imposed in part for financial reasons to ensure that priests' assets pass to the church, not to heirs.\n\nFrancis told the bishops at the end of the voting that he would indeed reopen the work of a 2016 commission that studied the issue of women deacons. And he said he planned to take the bishops' overall recommendations and prepare a document of his own before the end of the year.\n\nSome conservatives and traditionalists have warned that any papal opening to married priests or women deacons would lead the church to ruin. They accused the synod organizers and even the pope himself of heresy for even considering flexibility on mandatory priestly celibacy.\n\nThey vented their outrage most visibly this week when thieves stole three indigenous statues featuring a naked pregnant woman from a Vatican-area church and tossed them to into the Tiber River.\n\nThe statues, which conservatives said were pagan idols, were recovered unscathed by Italy's Carabinieri police. They were on display Saturday as the synod bishops voted on the final document, which was approved with each paragraph receiving the required two-thirds majority.\n\nFrancis has long said he appreciates the discipline and the gift of celibacy, but that it can change, given that it is discipline and tradition, not doctrine.", "description": "Catholic bishops from the Amazon called Saturday for the church to let married men become priests and to let women become deacons.", "authors": ["Nicole Winfield", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db4aa63e94e86566840193e?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
