Pavements were scattered with the glass of several smashed shop-fronts and billboards had been torn down.\n\nProtesters blocked roads in the north, the south and the Bekaa Valley, among other areas on Friday, the National News Agency (NNA) reported. Schools were closed on the instructions of the government.\n\n\"We are one people united against the state. We want it to fall,\" said a protester in the town of Jeita, some 20km (12.4 miles) from Beirut. \"Revolution, revolution!\" they chanted.\n\nIn Beirut, several thousands of people marched near the government's Serail headquarters chanting \"the people want the downfall of the regime\".\n\nThis was the second wave of nationwide protests this month.\n\nIn a country fractured along sectarian lines, the unusually wide geographic reach of these protests has been seen as a sign of deepening anger with politicians who have jointly led Lebanon into crisis.\n\nThe anti-government protests in a country mired in economic crisis entered their second day on Friday.\n\nThe government, which includes nearly all of Lebanon's main parties, is struggling to implement long-delayed reforms that are seen as more vital than ever to begin resolving the crisis.\n\nThe Lebanese newspaper an-Nahar described it as \"a tax intifada\", or uprising, across Lebanon. Another daily, al-Akhbar, declared it \"the WhatsApp revolution\" that had shaken Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri's unity government.\n\n\"We're not here over WhatsApp - we're here over everything, fuel, food, bread, everything.\"\n\n\n\nThousands have taken to the streets in Lebanon as anger grows over gov't tax plans amid an economic crisis in the country #\u0627\u062c\u0627_\u0648\u0642\u062a_\u0646\u062d\u0627\u0633\u0628 pic.twitter.com/JzMfLp9pom \u2014 Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) October 18, 2019\n\nTwo foreign workers choked to death from a fire that spread to a building near the protests in Beirut, the NNA said.\n\nSeeking ways to boost revenues, a government minister on Thursday announced plans to raise a new fee of 20 cents per day for calls via voice over internet protocol (VoIP), used by applications including Facebook-owned WhatsApp.\n\n\"It was the last straw,\" 41-year-old Rami told Al Jazeera, as men threw wood ripped from a nearby construction site onto a bonfire in the middle of the capital's main thoroughfare.\n\n\"The people were already at the edge barely holding on. The WhatsApp issue broke whatever they were still holding on to. Thank God, the people have awoken,\" Rami said.\n\nAs the protests spread, Telecoms Minister Mohamed Choucair phoned into Lebanese broadcasters on Thursday evening to say the proposed levy had been revoked.\n\n191018033008002\n\nShattered by war between 1975 and 1990, Lebanon has one of the world's highest debt burdens as a share of its economy.\n\nEconomic growth has been hit by regional conflict and instability. Unemployment among those aged under 35 runs at 37 percent.\n\nThe kind of steps needed to fix the national finances have long proven elusive. Sectarian politicians, many of them civil war veterans, have long used state resources for their own political benefit and are reluctant to cede prerogatives.\n\nThe crisis has been compounded by a slowdown in capital flows to Lebanon, which has long depended on remittances from its diaspora to meet financing needs, including the state's deficit.\n\nThe financial crunch has added to the impetus for reform but the government's steps have yet to convince foreign donors who have offered billions in financial assistance conditional on changes.\n\nThe strains have emerged recently in the real economy where importers have been unable to secure dollars at the pegged exchange rate.", "description": "Thousands of protesters march for a second day in anti-government demonstrations over the country's economic crisis.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/18/00cc29c90ca94f9bbb115526806f1ee7_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
