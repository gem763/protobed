It is: Bass, how low can you go?\n\nIf you know the one I mean, you\u2019re probably now going to find that sample, which has become sterling\u2019s soundtrack of late, very hard to get out of your head.\n\nIf you\u2019re prepared to forgive me for that vexatious ear worm, and would like an answer to the question, it all very much depends on just how base the current government is prepared to be.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWhich means, in other words, that the pound in our pockets could have a long way to fall.\n\nSterling\u2019s value has basically become yoked to the Britain\u2019s dire political situation.\n\nA currency is, in many ways, a barometer for the international markets\u2019 view of a country\u2019s economy. Only within the halls of Brexit\u2019s most fevered zealots is no deal seen as anything other than a disaster for Britain\u2019s.\n\nWith that remaining an all too real possibility, it falls whenever the threat level is raised. It is Boris Johnson taking it to Defcon One that has resulted in the currency\u2019s current weakness.\n\nThe possibility of a General Election delivering a hard Brexit government has only served to exacerbate the markets\u2019 fears.\n\nBy contrast, any polling showing Remain parties doing well, could be expected to strengthen sterling. Needless to say, it immediately jumped in response to Philip Lee\u2019s decision to cross the floor of the House of Commons and join the Liberal Democrats. One of his reasons was the damage the Johnson government is inflicting upon Britain\u2019s government.\n\nThe all time low against the dollar, the most widely quoted reference point because of its status as a reserve currency, was reached way back in 1985 when the pound closed at just over $1.05.\n\nAt the time of writing, it was just above $1.20, still quite a bit above that level.\n\nNow, we know no deal will be bad. But how bad remains open to debate. Some think there are things which could be done to mitigate it, the fabled \u201cside deals\u201d which the EU has shown scant appetite for. Perhaps lorries being stuck in queues at Dover and Calais leading to shortages of fresh food, medicines, etc, will force the UK government to see some sense.\n\nThese are the sort of calculations that are informing the stance of currency traders.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The converse is that if it can\u2019t, the pound could yet fall a lot further. If it happens, it is entirely conceivable that it could reach parity with the dollar, or even fall below it.\n\nThe economic consequences of its current instability are malign. Even if sterling\u2019s weakness makes exports cheaper, it raises manufacturers\u2019 input costs so the benefit is limited. And the uncertainty over the UK\u2019s position will, anyway, serve to put buyers off entering into contracts to buy British goods \u2013 however cheap they get.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
