It's a risky bet \u2014 but one that has paid off in the past.", "language": "en", "text": "Welcome to 2020 Vision, the Yahoo News column covering the presidential race with one key takeaway every weekday and a wrap-up each weekend. Reminder: There are 119 days until the Iowa caucuses and 393 days until the 2020 election.\n\nAs usual, Pete Buttigieg said it clearly and crisply. \u201cIn order to settle the question of electability, the best thing you can do is perform well in an actual election,\u201d Buttigieg told the New York Times late last month. \u201cIowa\u2019s of course the first. And so that\u2019s where a lot of our focus is going to go.\u201d\n\nKamala Harris was a little more blunt. \u201cI\u2019m f***ing moving to Iowa,\u201d she told a fellow senator a few days earlier.\n\nAnd thus begins the stage of any presidential primary when summer turns to fall, the polling leaders pull away and the would-be also-rans start betting the farm, so to speak, on Iowa. If I can surprise the media with a higher-than-expected finish in the first voting state, the thinking goes, the breathless coverage and renewed momentum will reset my campaign and propel me in New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina, Super Tuesday, the nomination, the presidency and a place in American history\u2026\n\nNow, where was I? Oh, right, a diner in Council Bluffs.\n\nThere\u2019s even a name for it \u2014 the Iowa Strategy. The question now, four months out, is: Can it actually work in 2020?\n\nButtigieg and Harris are putting that proposition to the test. In September, while attempting to gin up press interest with a freewheeling, everything\u2019s-on-the-record Iowa bus tour modeled on John McCain\u2019s Straight Talk Express, the South Bend, Ind., mayor announced he\u2019d opened 20 field offices and hired nearly 100 staff members statewide, putting his ground game on par with Elizabeth Warren\u2019s and Bernie Sanders\u2019s. His \u201crelational organizing\u201d model \u2014 volunteers contact friends and family first, instead of cold-calling strangers \u2014 is reportedly yielding a contact (i.e., a pick-up-the-phone) rate of 50 percent, as opposed to the usual 15 percent. He\u2019s pitching himself to rural voters as a fellow Midwesterner \u2014 bolder and less insidery than Joe Biden, but not as far left as Warren. And with a $19.1 million third-quarter fundraising haul (third in the field behind Sanders and Warren), he\u2019ll have the cash to keep going.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, started her campaign with a completely different approach: Focus at first on more diverse primaries \u2014 South Carolina, Nevada and California \u2014 while conserving resources often used in early states for television ads in later ones. But after failing to transform breakout moments into sustained strength in the polls, Harris conceded that any comeback would be dependent on Iowa and soon added another 60 organizers and opened 10 new offices around the state \u2014 bringing her current totals to 125 and 17, respectively. In early August, Harris embarked on a five-day Iowa bus tour, her longest retail swing to date, and she\u2019s back this week for a three-day jaunt to the Des Moines area.\n\nHarris speaks at the Polk County Steak Fry in Des Moines, Iowa, on Sept. 21.

Steve Bullock \u2014 are staking their campaigns on some form of the Iowa Strategy.\n\nBut Harris and Buttigieg are probably best positioned to capitalize. Though Buttigieg is polling a distant fourth nationally \u2014 with 5.5 percent support on average, he\u2019s more than 10 percentage points behind Sanders and roughly 20 points behind Biden and Warren \u2014 in Iowa he\u2019s much closer, at 11.3 percent, to the top tier: less than 1 point behind Sanders and about 10 points behind Biden and Warren. For Buttigieg, a finish in the top three isn\u2019t out of the question, especially with Biden struggling to respond to President Trump\u2019s Ukraine onslaught and Sanders (and possibly some voters) shaken by a recent heart attack scare. And those same forces could also boost Harris, who polls just behind Buttigieg nationally and ahead of the rest of the field in Iowa.", "description": "Can the Iowa Strategy work for lower-polling candidates in 2020?", "authors": ["Andrew Romano", "West Coast Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NCqTkTm4PrNhKwAiuvnmSQ--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/73e3cc30-e913-11e9-bf9d-9eaf17e855f3", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
