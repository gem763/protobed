Typically the regulator approves or denies a pipeline tolling application after the bidding has finished.\n\nThe CER noted Enbridge\u2019s control of much of the pipelines out of western Canada, the lack of alternatives for oil shippers and the \u201cconsiderable opposition\u201d to the open season.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has concerns regarding the fairness of Enbridge\u2019s open season process and the perception of abuse of Enbridge\u2019s market power,\u201d the CER said.\n\nThe nearly 3 million barrel-per-day Mainline is North America\u2019s largest pipeline system and carries the bulk of Canadian crude exports to the United States.\n\nA number of producers, including Canadian Natural Resources Ltd and Suncor, wrote to the CER in August, urging the regulator to intervene and protesting the conditions offered by Enbridge.\n\nJackie Forrest, director of research at the ARC Energy Institute, welcomed the \u201cunprecedented\u201d decision given the scale of producer opposition to Enbridge\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cThese were very unique circumstances where you had producers who represented 2.7 million bpd of production very concerned that the proposal did not meet regulatory requirements for open access,\u201d she said.\n\nCalgary-based Enbridge negotiated with shippers for commitments on Mainline for 18 months before launching a two-month bidding period in August.\n\n\u201cEnbridge remains committed to moving ahead with contract carriage on the Mainline and has strong support for our offering. We will evaluate this decision and the next steps that we will take towards implementing contract carriage,\u201d Enbridge spokesman Jesse Semko said in a statement.\n\nCanadian producers Cenovus Energy and Imperial Oil, as well as some large U.S. refiners, spoke out in favor of the Mainline overhaul, arguing it would give more certainty on shipping capacity.\n\nCanada holds the world\u2019s third-largest crude reserves but years of regulatory delays and environmental opposition have stymied development of new export pipelines, contributing to falling capital investment and slowing growth in the oil sands.\n\nThis year the government of Alberta, Canada\u2019s main oil-producing province, introduced production curtailments to ease congestion on pipelines.\n\nIndustry sources said the decision was a blow to Enbridge, but not entirely surprising given the scale of opposition to the Mainline overhaul.\n\n\u201cBack to the drawing board for them,\u201d one trading source said.", "description": "The Canada Energy Regulator on Friday stopped Enbridge Inc from auctioning the right to send crude oil through its Mainline pipeline system due to the \"perception of abuse of Enbridge's market power.\"", "authors": ["Nia Williams", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
