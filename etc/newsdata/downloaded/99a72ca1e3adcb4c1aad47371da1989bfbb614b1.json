Photo: Joan Marcus\n\nJaclyn Backhaus\u2019s Wives, a swift and playful feminist manifesto, tells us flat-out that it\u2019s looking to mess with narrative norms. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be more interesting if we actually grew to like each other?\u201d a dead king\u2019s mistress asks that same king\u2019s wife in the play\u2019s first act. \u201cA subversion,\u201d she suggests, \u201cof what everyone wants and expects to happen.\u201d Three acts later (the play\u2019s only 80 minutes long, and it bounces quickly through its four sections \u2014 a game of hopscotch on a central theme), a college student joins a club for witches. \u201cWhat does not exist yet?\u201d she asks the universe, searching for a metaphor for herself that doesn\u2019t feel used, owned, colonized. \u201cI am after a new form.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cnew form\u201d Backhaus gravitates towards\u2014modular, mischievous, a series of crescendos\u2014strikes me as a popular one these days. It\u2019s one of the primary genre responses of our moment to our moment. Jackie Sibblies Drury\u2019s Marys Seacole, Jen Silverman\u2019s Collective Rage: A Play in Five Betties, Jeremy O. Harris\u2019s Slave Play, and Clare Barron\u2019s Dance Nation all perform their own variation on what I think of as the Exorcism Play \u2014 or, as a corollary, the Seance Play. Two related, uncoincidentally witchy practices, the former sometimes necessitated by the latter. It\u2019s anti-Aristotelian, implicitly\u2014sometimes explicitly\u2014femme and sexy (multiple climaxes), and deeply concerned with ancestry. It aims to challenge our assumptions about historical truth and about what makes a \u201cwell made\u201d drama, digging down to the roots of individuals, social structures, and theatrical structures and attempting, sometimes violently, to purge the toxins it finds there.\n\nWives sits on the lighter end of the Exorcism Play spectrum, its tone for the most part winking and exuberant, its best moments when that exuberance stays weird. Backhaus\u2019s wackiness often serves as a direct antidote for tendency towards schmaltz, and her play is always stronger when it\u2019s less dewy-eyed. The production\u2019s quartet of quick-shifting actors flourish under Margot Bordelon\u2019s crisp, comically assured direction: There\u2019s genuine warmth and readiness in their performances. They\u2019re there for each other, and watching them is like watching an enthusiastic came of four-square.\n\nThat game begins in the mid-1500s in France, where the dippy, swaggering King Henry II (Sathya Sridharan) ostentatiously prefers his mistress, Diane (Aadya Bedi) to his wife, Catherine de\u2019 Medici (Purva Bedi). A talkative, rubber-faced cook named Augustine (Adina Verson) resolves to stay loyal to Catherine, but can\u2019t help pitying Diane and fixing her fancy \u201changover sodas\u201d made of \u201cbitters and bubbling water\u2026 and gold.\u201d Bordelon adroitly handles the play\u2019s cantering, heightened-but-casual banter. Especially in its first act, Backhaus\u2019s text doesn\u2019t contain all that many layered actions \u2014 people say what they mean immediately and in the slangy squawk of 2019 (\u201cWhat a fuckhead,\u201d says Catherine of Henri; \u201cU fakeass bitch!\u201d Diane snaps at Catherine). Pauses would kill the patter, and Bordelon keeps her actors flying. Meanwhile, the dense, delightful, period-hopping sound design by Kate Marvin provides vital fluidity and dimension: It takes a text that sometimes borders on thin and gives it body and buoyancy.\n\nAfter Henri\u2019s untimely (and very dumb) death, Diane and Catherine make their patriarchy-smashing pact to become friends. We don\u2019t, however, get to see their friendship unfold \u2014 the play skips onwards to its second act, perhaps somewhat giving the lie to its own commitment to find interest in female \u201charmony\u201d rather than the \u201cwar\u201d (in dramatic terms, \u201cconflict\u201d) predicated by \u201ca man\u2019s world.\u201d But that dissonance soon dissipates, because Wives\u2019 second act is by far its strongest, and in its new characters we can see the effects of the promise made by Act One\u2019s reconciled rivals. In Act Two, we meet the three wives of Ernest Hemingway (Sridharan) who succeeded in outliving him. In black frocks and black hats, Hadley Richardson (P. Bedi), Martha Gellhorn (A. Bedi), and Mary Welsh Hemingway (Verson) gather to reminisce and drink whiskey at the big man\u2019s wake.\n\nWhile Wives still has several places to go\u2014Act Three takes us to India under the British Raj and Act Four to a modern university, where two young women are, like Backhaus, searching for new forms, for independent voices, and for the \u201cconstellation of [their] Ancestors\u201d\u2014the wives of \u201cBig Ern\u201d leave the sharpest, most indelible impression. \u201cThe women catch up like they are old friends not just ex-wives of the same mythical human writer,\u201d says Backhaus\u2019s stage direction, and as Hadley, Martha, and Mary, the play\u2019s trio of actresses feels the most connected, the most tapped into something complex and excitingly insoluble. As Mary, the \u201cLast Wife\u201d and the one still tearfully attached to the dead genius, Verson brilliantly balances right on the edge of clown. She\u2019s constantly compelling: Her naivet\u00e9 is broad, and so is her grief \u2014 and both are, also, real. And when the muscular, self-possessed Aadya Bedi\u2019s Martha stands defiant, drink in hand, and delivers her own eulogy, there\u2019s a fierce grandeur to it. \u201cShe was a better writer than him in every way,\u201d Martha announces of herself, without losing her wry smile, side-stepping tragic self-pity. \u201cBut his presence clouded everything, and people would confirm her betterness privately, but in public she was\u2026 a wife. Just a wife\u2026. I was a fish! I was a good swimmer, I had a fucking spear for a fucking nose, and here I am, dead, mounted on someone\u2019s wall forever. My life was taken for sport.\u201d\n\nThe wrench and the thrill of Wives\u2019 second act is that it manages to hold so many things in its hands at once. Despite its gleeful exorcism of Papa\u2019s ghost (Verson is wildly funny when Mary eventually explodes into unhinged but enlightened shrieks: \u201cShitty! They were shitty!! He was shitty!!!\u201d), it doesn\u2019t, in fact, cancel Hemingway. If not forgiving, it\u2019s still fundamentally generous to a fellow artist, even in its quest to reveal the unacknowledged geniuses who suffered in his shadow. As Mary and Hadley and Martha perform a purgative ritual, spattering a huge trophy marlin with whiskey and chanting the words \u201cje ne sais quoi\u201d\u2014that romantic little phrase that, as Mary puts it, reduces a woman\u2019s \u201cyears of existence and experience\u201d to \u201can air, a manner, a wisp of fragrance\u201d\u2014Backhaus\u2019s play feels its most envigorating, its most shameless and free. Though, in the play\u2019s final big crescendo, Aadya Bedi delivers a long, semi-absurdist monologue of liberation near its end, there\u2019s something fresher in the middle. There, as three angry yet ecstatic women dance around a giant fish, the self-consciousness of the search for \u201ca new form\u201d and the creeping sentimentality of ancestral communion fall away, and what\u2019s left is a funny, ferocious, long overdue celebration.\n\nWives is at Playwrights Horizons through October 6.", "description": "Theater Review: Wives, by Jaclyn Backhaus, at Playwrights Horizons, A Group of Feminist-Inflected Conversations Between Historical Figures", "authors": ["Sara Holdren"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/16/16-wives.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
