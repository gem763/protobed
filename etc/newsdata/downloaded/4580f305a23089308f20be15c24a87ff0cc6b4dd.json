But worse yet, to the council, is the \"Chick-fil-A Coin Toss\" at the start of the Jayhawks' football home games.\n\nMORE THAN 100 OHIO PASTORS PETITION FOR CHICK-FIL-A IN THEIR TOWN: 'TASTE AND SEE THAT THE LORD IS GOOD'\n\n\u201cThe culture of Chick-fil-A fosters hate and discrimination on multiple levels,\u201d the Sexuality & Gender Diversity Faculty and Staff Council wrote in a two-page letter, accusing university leaders of being \"more concerned about money and corporate sponsorship than the physical, emotional, and mental well being of marginalized and LGBTQ people.\"\n\nWhile the fast-food chain is celebrated for its exceptional customer service, it has come under fire several times after its president and CEO, Dan Cathy, publicly supported traditional marriage in 2012 and opponents have accused Chick-fil-A of being anti-LGBTQ for its charitable giving to the Family Research Council and Salvation Army, to name a few.\n\nJOHNNY DEPP DIOR AD PULLED AMID 'CULTURAL APPROPRIATION' OUTCRY\n\nThe faculty group added: \u201cThe arrival of Chick-fil-A in this building is insulting, counterproductive and unacceptable.\"\n\nIn response, the College Republicans on campus started a petition for students, alumni, and concerned citizens to send to Chancellor Doug Girod.\n\n\"Tell our university administration that our community wants Chick-fil-A on this campus,\" the conservative group wrote.\n\nCHICK-FIL-A DIRECTOR'S PEACE OFFERING TO 'STRESSED OUT' POPEYES EMPLOYEES GOES VIRAL\n\nKatie Batza, an associate professor of women and gender studies, told the Kansas City Star that hundreds \"will boycott or protest\" but lamented that the request was \"falling on deaf ears.\"\n\nInterim Provost Carl Lejuez sent an email to faculty and staff, however.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cMoving forward, I believe it is important to have thoughtful discussion and deliberation when we enter into contracts.
