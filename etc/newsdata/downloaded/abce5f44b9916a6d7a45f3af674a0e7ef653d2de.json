Indeed, it is a difference of more than \u00a3130,000.\n\nOf course, you need to compare the standard of the two properties, but even if one is much better you may ask whether it would cost that much money to have brought the cheaper property up to the level of the more expensive one.\n\nEven allowing for house price inflation during this period, it would suggest that it may be worth putting in a lower offer than the asking price.\n\nEstate agents warn that there are other features in a property that help to determine the price\n\nBut remember size isn't everything\n\nHowever, there are - of course - a multitude of factors that a buyer needs to take into account when buying a property. And ultimately, a property is only worth what a buyer is willing to pay for it, which can be a highly personal issue.\n\nEstate agents also add a word of caution, saying that calculating the price per square footage fails to take into account other features in a property, such as natural light.\n\nNorth London estate agent Jeremy Leaf said: 'The use of price per square foot as a comparison tool has increased considerably over the past few years but those using it should do so with caution as these figures are useful as a guide only.\n\nBuyers and sellers need to take into account other factors such as location, specification, outlook, natural light, condition etc which could all render the price per square foot figure almost academic in some cases Jeremy Leaf, estate agent\n\n'Buyers and sellers need to take into account other factors such as location, specification, outlook, natural light, condition etc which could all render the price per square foot figure almost academic in some cases.\n\n'On the other hand, if you are comparing very similar-sized units in a standardised block of flats then the comparison price by area could be more than useful, although again significant differences can apply.\n\n'Even almost identical flats or houses in the same building or street can vary considerably in value, appeal to different buyers and appeal to different buyers. There is no substitute for an accurate market appraisal without cost from an independent, suitably-experienced high-street estate agent.'\n\nAnd buying agent Henry Pryor said: 'If an agent starts quoting price per sq ft you know he's on the back foot.\n\n'I know there is a wall of money trying to commoditise second hand homes, but if I told you that the house you wanted to buy was worth more per square inch/foot/meter would you pay more? Of course you wouldn't!\n\n'Homes are like fine art. Is a Picasso that's twice the size of another Picasso worth twice as much? Of course not. You can't 'value' that feeling - good or bad that we all get when we walk into a house. It's like trying to get a computer to value a Chippendale chair. Forget it.'", "description": "A floor plan can be used to help buyers get closer to the true market value of a property and decide how much they should offer.", "authors": ["Myra Butterworth For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/03/19/17/11191498-0-image-a-15_1553016123475.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-22"}
