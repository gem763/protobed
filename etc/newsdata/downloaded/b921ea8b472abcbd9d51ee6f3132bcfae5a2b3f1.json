Thanks to some sleuthing from none other than...Jason Mendoza??\n\n\u201cTinker, Tailor, Demon, Spy\u201d opens with another failed bonding exercise between our human subjects. Eleanor has them play a game of Magical Pictionary to see how well they all knew each other. Unfortunately, the whole thing comes to a tragic and violent end as Chidi\u2019s pony drawing came to life and started attacking people, leaving everybody on edge and wondering where to take things next.\n\nJust when you thought things couldn\u2019t get worse for Team Cockroach, in pops demon Glenn from the Bad Place (he was the hooded figure coming into the train station at the end of the last episode) to stir the pot even more with a shocking revelation: Michael is actually Vicki in disguise.\n\nThis reveal fuels the rest of the episode, with Eleanor and the others finding it hard to trust Michael after he explains some of the ways he\u2019s lied to them in recent weeks. It shows how, even though Michael has made improvements over the past few seasons, he still has trouble leaving all of his bad habits behind.\n\nIt all comes to a head when Eleanor, desperate to find something that will solve this mystery and fix the team\u2019s problems, demands Michael take off his human skin suit to prove he\u2019s not Vicki. However, Michael refuses out of principle, because he doesn\u2019t want Eleanor and the others judging him for what he really is: a 1,828.80m tall fire squid.\n\nThe camera centres on Michael, mortified and a little angry at the lack of trust, as he shares details about his true physical form. There\u2019s a reason he doesn\u2019t want to take the suit off. He\u2019s afraid they\u2019ll never look at him the same way again. Unfortunately, he\u2019s probably right and it speaks to the still-unspoken strain in their group dynamic. They all love Michael, but in the end they can never truly know him. It\u2019s kind of sad, if you think about it.\n\nLuckily, it doesn\u2019t take long for the actual truth to come out. It wasn\u2019t Michael who had been secretly replaced, it was Janet. And guess who figured it out first? That\u2019s right, Jason Mendoza babyyyyyy! (With a little help from Mindy St. Clair and Derek\u2019s sex toys. And Derek did mention he\u2019s been evolving...) Jason knew something was up when he\u2019d called Janet \u201cgirl\u201d and she hadn\u2019t responded \u201cnot a girl\u201d like she\u2019s always done. And thinking back on the past few episodes, there were plenty of other signs that something weird was going on with Janet. I mean, come on, she suggested Tahani punch Glenn in the face! That had Bad Janet written all over it.\n\nIn the end, Jason and Michael decide to head out on a rescue mission to fetch Janet from the Bad Place as Eleanor and the others figure out how to hold down the fort without half of the team needed to keep the experiment from falling apart. It\u2019s clear that next week is going to be a wild ride. But at least they\u2019ve still got Glenn in a fish tank.\n\nOh Brent, you weird sad sack of noise.\n\nRandom Musings:\n\nI freaking knew something weird had happened on that train!\n\nI loved the moment Simone went \u201cno no no no no\u201d to Brent after he called Chidi \u201cmy brother.\u201d I\u2019m curious to see how that relationship develops, as it\u2019s clear Simone has no interest in taking any of Brent\u2019s shit. That said, I wouldn\u2019t want it to turn into the stereotypical situation where a black woman is brought in to solve a white man\u2019s casual racism/sexism\u2014unless their intention is to draw attention to that trope to unpack it. We\u2019ll have to see what happens there.\n\nGlenn is quickly becoming my favourite newcomer to the faux Good Place. I just want to grab a 12pm mimosas brunch with him and talk about mushroom water for hours.\n\nYou have to applaud a show that can turn a discussion of tentacles, teeth, fire, and \u201clots of juice\u201d into one of the most vulnerable moments of the series so far.", "description": "Things have seemed a little off in Eleanor\u2019s experiment to determine the fate of humanity, and in the latest episode of The Good Place, we finally found out why.
