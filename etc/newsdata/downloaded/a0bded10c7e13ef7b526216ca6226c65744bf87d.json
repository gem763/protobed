Terrier ran to break this down for a some Terry's so I want to ask you first stop is this investigation even legitimate. While shore. It is. It is legitimate. That that prosecutor who's running and not the attorney general but the actual prosecutor who is doing the investigation is a man named. John Durham he's the US attorney in Connecticut he is profoundly admired by Democrats. And Republicans he was nominated for the position of US attorney in Connecticut which require senate approval by Connecticut's two democratic senators he's got a sterling reputation. As a mob prosecutor as basically. Are non political prosecutor so he is. Not anybody's fool and he is not going to be. You know engage hasn't got a wild goose chase second. This was an administrative review you remember prep president trump directed the attorney general take a look at the origins of the Russian investigation which president from deeply resents. Was anything wrong there. And ended is probably worth looking at you know you don't really want the FBI the CIA to investigate political campaigns without a really good. Reason and that's what he was to take a look at he now believes that's a pretty low threshold. That he needs some of the powers of a criminal investigation to get to the bottom of things. You know there has been some wrongdoing we know because a judge on the secret court that that issues. You know or warrants for wiretapping and national security cases. She has already said should she was not fully a fairly informed. By the FBI agents who petitions are for the permission to ignorant tapped trump associates. So there are there are questions there that need to be answered to the satisfaction people sure it's legitimate wedding and find anything no notes but it's legitimate. Yeah I think people I think it does raises concerns for some people that the president may be trying to go after. Is enemies but I want I want to get your. Opinion on this how does all of this to work in the middle of an impeachment investigation going on all these impeachment investigations. While that's a great question first then there's no question there's fear that trump is abusing the Justice Department he has tried to before it's pretty clear and there's a lot of concern that attorney general William Barr who deeply mischaracterized. The original mullah report. Is not trustworthy that he is it more a political tool then an attorney Johnson a legitimate concerns on that site how it plays into impeachment it's. It's really where bit of good news for Republicans that they they can say look the Democrats have been going after the president again and again. The Russian investigation. Did not turn up any evidence of conspiracy or coordination between the trump campaign and the Kremlin to the Democrats were wrong about that and there may have been something criminal and how the deep stayed in their view launched the investigation the first place they need some good news because impeachment. Inquiries not gone well for them and this gives him at least some Sutton to throw into the mix. Yes so as this is going on the White House is considering you know creating several new positions designed to deal with. The ongoing investigation is this like Esther aunts and change in strategy. Well. Once again gone back to two mr. Durham the prosecutor he's unlikely to be that cool of the trump White House he just hasn't. The long career there's no indication that he's that guy. Nevertheless it plays into the term strategy either read that if he didn't call attention incoherent strategies has thrown everything at the wall hoping something sticks. Because the president. Needs to beef up his legal team he needs to have a co parent strategy he needs to have message discipline. Because he's in trouble as the winds this comment on the evidence comet comes in it's pretty clear. That the American people polls show and increasing number of Republicans. Take this very seriously this is a serious investigation and he needs a serious response to. Terry covered these impeachment before where you see all of this knowing. Odd trial in the senate we're gonna see that I'm I'm pretty sure. It it certainly seems that the Democrats are moving towards impeachment and putting the president on trial in the senate. And then the question is how much does this metastasized. How much does the spread are there are other witnesses are their other. Countries where the president might have been using his power for political purposes. Yesterday. At an event he is of the president's chief trade negotiator Peter Navarro was asked point blank in it's trade negotiations with China. Did he bring up investigating the Biden's you remember president trump told China in public hey start investigating the Biden's. And you this official was asked have you raised that with China were you told to raise that with China. And he refused to answer so if this investigation starts spiraling into other areas. In all bets are off. All right senior national correspondent Terry ran in our DC bureau breaking it down thank you so much.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "The Justice Department announced it is opening a criminal inquiry into how the Russia investigation began.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/191025_abcnl_debrief_moran3_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
