I definitely don\u2019t need any more socks or ties, and I would be very upset to be given a \u201cBrexmas\u201d gift of an early general election.\n\nWhat I\u2019d really, really like for Santa to drop out of his sack on Christmas Eve is one of the special 50p coins commemorating Brexit. These phantasmagoric amulets really do exist, thousands of them, even though they never quite made it into your pocket or purse. Part political stunt, part physical embodiment of national failure, the Royal Mint struck them in a pre-production trial, and now, they say, they are to be melted down.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHow much did the whole exercise cost? Can it be put on the side of a bus, along with the wasted \u00a3100 million Brexit publicity drive? That money was diverted from the public information budget usually devoted to stuff such as promoting the flu jab, firework safety and the Highway Code. And we don\u2019t even get some wry amusement from our most ironic coin of the realm.\n\nWhat a shame! They represent a fine symbol and token of our collective national Brexit trauma. The date inscribed on them, with unwise precision, 31st October 2019, is in fact only the latest of the many the coin designers have had to scrub.

It could cover anything from Norway-style soft Brexit through to Thatcherites\u2019 paradise \u201cSingapore on Thames\u201d. It just about works for Remain or delay. It means nothing, and could be spun as a sort of antidote to the anti-social nastiness of Halloween.\n\nThe Brexit 50p is certainly a less elegant design than the 1973 \u201cjoined hands\u201d version issued on entry to the European Economic Community.\n\nNow the phantom 50p coin joins the long list of Brexit ephemera, including \u201cBreggsit\u201d egg cups, tea towels and tattoos of a grinning Nigel Farage. Like the famous glockenspiel player on Parliament Square, we will wonder if it really happened, and why. Maybe, like the fabulously valuable 1933 old penny, a few stray proof versions may escape from the Mint and sell at auction? Maybe senior ministers got a memento one? A coin, then, for the few not the many.\n\nThe good news, by the way, is that the Royal Mint is going to issue a Wallace and Gromit 50p instead, celebrating 30 years of Nick Park\u2019s charming creations, who have served with such distinction as ambassadors of \u201cglobal Britain\u201d. The coin will be adorned with the Latin motto \u201cCaseus praestans\u201d \u2013 cracking cheese. I\u2019d take one of those as a (second best) numismatic Xmas gift.", "description": "Have you decided what you\u2019d like for Christmas? I have.
