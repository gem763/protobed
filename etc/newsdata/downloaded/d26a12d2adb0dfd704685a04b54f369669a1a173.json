We are currently analysing today\u2019s decision.\"\n\nThe Federal Court will list the matter for a penalty hearing at a later date.", "description": "The Federal Court has dealt a blow to the Palaszczuk government by declaring its support for the CFMEU to enter worksites without a permit a legal \"nonsense\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_33/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2580213dcc9c5bceca12ca5cef85ac17dd796961", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
