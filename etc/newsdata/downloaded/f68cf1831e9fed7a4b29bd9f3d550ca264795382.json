The book is a wrenching and intimate story of sexual assault, survival, self-discovery, trauma, family, and friendship. It\u2019s a beautiful, revealing self-portrait. It\u2019s funny, and it\u2019s heartbreaking, and it\u2019s an inspiration.\n\nThere\u2019s just no other way to say it: The writing is exquisite. Describing a drunk voicemail she left her boyfriend the night of the assault, she wrote: \u201cThe words were indistinguishable, my voice sliding like butter in a hot pan, dragging from one to the next.\u201d\n\nThe memoir is also an indictment of the criminal justice system, of former Judge Aaron Persky\u2014who was recalled after controversy erupted over the short sentence\u2014and of the case\u2019s media coverage, which often featured glowing quotes about Turner\u2019s soft-spoken manners and impressive swimming career alongside grisly details of the assault.\n\nFrom the moment she woke up in the hospital, Miller tried to protect everyone in her life\u2014her sister, her boyfriend, her friends, her parents\u2014from what Turner had done to her. Of course, that was impossible, but her sincere efforts make for some of the most touching moments in the book.\n\n\u201cEvery time it rained, my dad said, \u2018The plants must be so happy!\u2019 How would it feel when he\u2019d learn his daughter had been raped?\u201d she wrote. \u201cI would\u2019ve wanted someone to have looked me in the eye, lowered their voice, gently laid their hand on mine. Perhaps I could do this for them.\u201d\n\nThe next morning\u2014after she told them, then collapsed into her mother\u2019s arms\u2014she found a lemon pie on the counter.\n\n\u201cIn the hushed hours of morning while I\u2019d been sleeping, my dad had picked lemons from the backyard, boiled sugar and eggs over the stove, pressed fingertips into crust along the edge, sprinkled powdered sugar on top,\u201d Miller wrote.\n\n\u201cYou looked dead.\u201d\n\nBut the story really begins in January 2015, when Miller awoke in the hospital without underwear, her hair covered in thousands of pine needles, with dried blood on her hands. Around 4 a.m., two Swedish cyclists had found Turner on top of Miller\u2019s half-naked, unconscious body. They yelled at him, chased him down when he ran, and waited for police to arrive.", "description": "Courtesy of Mariah TiffanyWhen she received a letter from the White House in 2016, Chanel Miller was still living in anonymity.She was known to the world as Emily Doe, the extraordinarily articulate and courageous survivor of sexual assault whose attacker, Brock Turner, served just three months in county", "authors": ["Olivia Messer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JthxcZdmHQkXdr1wD1fl_g--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/a1cdd77f51f116251e02194101742b4d"}
