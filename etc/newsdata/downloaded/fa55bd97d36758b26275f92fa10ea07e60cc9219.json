The US government concluded Israeli operatives were most likely to have placed them to spy on Donald Trump and his associates, the news website reported.\n\nOne of the three former intelligence and national security officials, none of whom were identified in the article, said the Trump administration \u2013 which describes itself as the most pro-Israel US government in history \u2013 did not rebuke its ally.\n\n\u201cThe reaction ... was very different than it would have been in the last [Obama] administration,\u201d one former senior intelligence official was quoted as saying. \u201cWith the current administration, there are a different set of calculations in regard to addressing this.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian was unable to immediately verify the report, which emerged as the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, fights for his political life ahead of elections next week.\n\nThe report said the FBI and other agencies used detailed forensic analysis of the devices, known as StingRays, to link them to Israeli agents. \u201cIt was pretty clear that the Israelis were responsible,\u201d a former senior intelligence official was quoted as saying.\n\nAn Israeli embassy spokesperson in the Washington, Elad Strohmayer, denied the report, saying: \u201cThese allegations are absolute nonsense. Israel doesn\u2019t conduct espionage operations in the United States, period.\u201d The White House, the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the US Secret Service did not comment, Politico said.\n\nNetanyahu was in Sochi on Thursday for talks with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, that have been interpreted back home as a last-minute attempt to win over Russia-speaking Israelis for next Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nThe prime minister has launched an aggressive campaign to woo the minority of one million people, running ads in Russian and erecting a giant poster of him and Putin on his Likud party\u2019s Tel Aviv headquarters.\n\nNetanyahu has also been shoring up nationalist voters with feisty language and hardline promises.\n\nOn Tuesday he announced that he would annex up to one-third of the occupied West Bank if he won re-election, drawing condemnation from the Palestinians, Arab countries, the UN, and the EU.\n\nOn Thursday Facebook said it had imposed sanctions on Netanyahu\u2019s page because of a violation of the company\u2019s hate speech policy. The tech firm said it had suspended the page\u2019s bot \u2013 or automated chat function \u2013 for 24 hours.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s page had called on voters to prevent the establishment of a government composed of \u201cArabs who want to destroy us all \u2014 women, children and men\u201d, sparking uproar by opposition politicians.", "description": "Report citing three former US officials says mobile phone surveillance devices were planted over past two years", "authors": ["Oliver Holmes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83a4cb65108845429a7003335f8b915f7edc8ff2/0_130_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6937743e244bfed975bf8d8ae650a2d9", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
