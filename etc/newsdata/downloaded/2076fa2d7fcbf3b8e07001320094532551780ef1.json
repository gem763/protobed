Justin Amash. Meijer denied access to the U.K.-based Drag Syndrome for a performance in a Grand Rapids building he owns during a project affiliated with the international ArtPrize competition. He has provided donated space for the project.\n\nMeijer, grandson of Meijer Inc. supermarket chain founder Frederik Meijer, said he worried about exploiting the performers after consulting with advocacy groups, and he informed organizers last month. Meijer added he was unclear whether they were acting of their own volition and believed they ought to be protected.\n\nACLU-Michigan\u2019s complaint says the performers \u201care choosing, with capacity, to perform in a touring drag troupe.\u201d DisArt, a Grand Rapids based organization that booked Drag Syndrome, provided such information about the artists who were scheduled to appear.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The site includes biographies of seven artists.\n\nThe Disability Drag Show takes place Saturday at another venue. The complaint seeks compensation for DisArt for costs associated with arranging and booking alternative space. A specific amount hasn\u2019t been requested, the ACLU said.\n\nMeijer told reporters that he\u2019s also curious to know what such developments could mean for private property owners.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan says GOP candidate Peter Meijer discriminated against the British drag group Drag Syndrome", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/drag-queen-michigan-complaint.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C809px%2C3328px%2C1739px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
