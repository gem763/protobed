It is estimated to have been downloaded fewer than 500,000 times, compared with TikTok\u2019s more than 500 million.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nThe popular video-sharing app TikTok opened an office in Mountain View, California, only a few minutes away from Facebook\u2019s Palo Alto headquarters, CNBC\u2019s Salvador Rodriguez reported this week.\n\nTikTok seems to be moving in on Facebook\u2019s territory figuratively and literally \u2013 it now occupies the office that Facebook\u2019s messaging app WhatsApp used to call home.\n\nTikTok is also poaching Facebook\u2019s employees, according to CNBC, hiring more than two dozen former Facebook employees since 2018. One person at TikTok told CNBC that the company offered salaries up to 20% higher than Facebook\u2019s to draw experienced employees from its competitors. TikTok has also reportedly hired employees from Apple, Google, Hulu, Snap, and other tech companies during this high-growth period.\n\nThough Facebook hasn\u2019t officially listed TikTok as a competitor in financial documents, the company seems to be aware of the growing threat from the short-form video app. In November, Facebook launched Lasso, a standalone video app that was nearly identical to TikTok. Lasso didn\u2019t take off; Sensor Tower estimates it\u2019s been downloaded 420,000 times outside China, while TikTok has more than 500 million users.\n\nFacebook\u2019s Instagram also appears to be working on a TikTok competitor. Discovered by the reverse app engineer Jane Manchun Wong, the tool is expected to be called \u201cClips\u201d and allow users to combine short videos and add music, mimicking TikTok.\n\nWhile TikTok has nowhere near the number of daily users as Facebook, the app\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, is growing quickly. ByteDance has been described as \u201cChina\u2019s Facebook,\u201d and at $75 billion it is the highest-valued private company in the world. ByteDance launched the Chinese version of TikTok, Douyin, in 2016, and the international version under the name TikTok a year later. In late 2017, the company purchased another video-sharing app, Musical.ly, and combined them in August 2018. By last month, TikTok was the top free non-gaming app in the US.\n\nIn leaked audio published by The Verge, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg described the company\u2019s plans to compete with TikTok: \u201cSo yeah. I mean, TikTok is doing well\u2026we\u2019re trying to first see if we can get it to work in countries where TikTok is not already big before we go and compete with TikTok in countries where they are big.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - TikTok is further encroaching on Facebook territory by moving into the former office of the Facebook-owned WhatsApp in Mountain View, California..
