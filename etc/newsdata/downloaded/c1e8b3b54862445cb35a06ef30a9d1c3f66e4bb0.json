over Xinjiang as \u2018groundless\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Beijing (AFP) \u2013 China hit back at the United States on Tuesday over the blacklisting of 28 Chinese entities accused of being implicated in rights violations against mostly Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region, saying the claims are \u201cgroundless\u201d.\n\nUS Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross announced the move to bar the entities on Monday, saying his country \u201ccannot and will not tolerate the brutal suppression of ethnic minorities within China.\u201d\n\nBut Beijing expressed \u201cstrong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition\u201d to the blacklist and defended its policy in the western frontier region, where rights groups say more than one million Uighurs and other mostly Muslim minorities are held in re-education camps.\n\n\u201cThere is no such thing as these so-called \u2018human rights issues\u2019 as claimed by the United States,\u201d said foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThese accusations are nothing more than an excuse for the United States to deliberately interfere in China\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d\n\nThe blacklisted firms included video surveillance company Hikvision, as well as artificial intelligence companies Megvii Technology and SenseTime, according to an update to the US Federal Register set to be published Wednesday.\n\nThe ban comes amid heightened tensions between the US and China, particularly over trade policy and Beijing\u2019s actions in Xinjiang.\n\nThe world\u2019s two biggest economies are in the midst of a trade war, having exchanged punitive tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in bilateral trade.\n\nOn Monday, the White House announced that talks between the two countries were set to resume on Thursday, with Beijing\u2019s top trade envoy Liu He due to meet US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n\nThe US has meanwhile stepped up its rhetoric against Beijing over its policies in Xinjiang, saying they are reminiscent of Nazi Germany.\n\nDuring last month\u2019s United Nations General Assembly, the State Department organised an event to highlight the plight of the Uighurs, with the United State\u2019s second-highest diplomat John Sullivan decrying \u201cChina\u2019s horrific campaign of repression.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Xinjiang, the Chinese government prevents Muslims from praying and reading the Quran, and it has destroyed or defaced a great number of mosques,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\n\u201cThis is a systematic campaign by the Chinese Communist Party to stop its own citizens from exercising their unalienable right to religious freedom.\u201d\n\nChina had until recently denied the existence of re-education camps, but now claims they are \u201cvocational training schools\u201d necessary to control terrorism.\n\n\u2013 Huawei targeted \u2013\n\nThe 28 entities blacklisted include 18 public security bureaus in Xinjiang, a police college and eight businesses.\n\n\u201cThese entities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China\u2019s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs and other members of Muslim minority groups,\u201d the Federal Register update said.\n\nSeveral of the blacklisted firms issued statements slamming the decision.\n\nVideo surveillance company Hikvision said the US listing had \u201cno factual basis.\u201d\n\n\u201c(We) call on the US government to re-examine based on the principle of fairness, justice and non-discrimination, and remove Hikvision from the entity list,\u201d it said.\n\nArtificial intelligence firm Megvii, which is backed by e-commerce giant Alibaba, said in a statement it \u201cstrongly\u201d protests against the decision, which it said \u201creflects a misunderstanding of our company.\u201d\n\nMegvii said only one percent of its revenue in 2018 was from projects in Xinjiang, while no revenue at all was generated from the region in the first six months of 2019.\n\nAI company SenseTime said it was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d and would \u201cwork closely with all relevant authorities to fully understand and resolve the situation.\u201d\n\nThe blacklisting of the companies follows Washington\u2019s earlier move to stop technology giant Huawei and other Chinese firms from obtaining government contracts.\n\nHikvision was also included in that ban, which will preclude any US federal agency from purchasing telecom or technology equipment from the firms and comes amid concern that Huawei is linked to Chinese intelligence.\n\nThe US fears that systems built by Huawei could be used by Beijing for espionage via secret \u201cbackdoors\u201d built into telecom networking equipment.", "description": "Beijing (AFP) \u2013 China hit back at the United States on Tuesday over the blacklisting of 28 Chinese entities
