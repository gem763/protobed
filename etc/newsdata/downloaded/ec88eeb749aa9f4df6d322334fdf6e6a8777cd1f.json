With an estimated 83% of American kids ages 6 to 12 watching YouTube daily, it\u2019s probably time to find out.\n\nYouTube is settling a case alleging it violated the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), a 21-year old federal law that requires parental consent before companies can collect and share data on viewers under age 13.\n\nYouTube \u2014 owned by Alphabet GOOG, -0.53% GOOGL, -0.48%, Google\u2019s parent company \u2014 isn\u2019t admitting liability in the settlement. But it is making changes. That includes limiting data collection for anyone watching children\u2019s content, regardless of how old they might be. It also means the end of personalized ads on these videos.\n\nJosh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, said it\u2019s a positive step that children will be subjected to less targeted advertising on the popular site, but he was disappointed regulators weren\u2019t demanding broader changes.\n\n\u201cA plethora of parental concerns about YouTube \u2014 from inappropriate content and recommendations to excessive screen time \u2014 can all be traced to Google\u2019s business model of using data to maximize watch-time and ad revenue,\u201d he said.\n\nBut parents can also address those concerns by making sure the sites their kids visit follow COPPA. Here\u2019s what to know about the law and how to find sites that follow it.\n\nWhy is it important to go to websites following COPPA\u2019s terms?\n\nAmerica has federal laws protecting privacy in specific contexts \u2014 like access to someone\u2019s medical information \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t have a law offering blanket protections.\n\nCOPPA is one of those specific carve outs, according to Angela Campbell, a Georgetown University Law Center professor who filed the initial complaint against YouTube and Google on behalf of groups including the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood and the Center for Digital Democracy.\n\nOn paper at least, COPPA is meant to shield kids from manipulative advertising, said Campbell, who chairs the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. Targeted ads can influence adults, she acknowledged, but \u201cthe potential for manipulation is even worse for kids. They don\u2019t really understand advertising at all.\u201d\n\nMoreover, unchecked data collection on non-compliant sites gives companies and third-parties the \u201cpotential to create huge profiles\u201d on kids from a tender age, she said. Campbell couldn\u2019t say how specific those profiles could get, but noted \u201cthere are thousands of data points\u201d \u2014 right down to the unique identifier of the device beaming the content.\n\nWhat does a COPPA-compliant site look like?\n\nIf a site is aimed at kids under age 13, it must have a privacy policy that \u201cclearly and comprehensively describes how personal information collected online from kids under 13 is handled,\u201d according to the FTC. The notice shouldn\u2019t only detail how the site collects information, it should also explain how connected third parties use information, the FTC says.\n\nThe site should also have an easy-to-read \u201cdirect notice\u201d to parents asking for permission to collect data. Parents need to give \u201cverifiable consent.\u201d They can consent by signing a form, linking a credit card to an account or other steps. And if they don\u2019t consent, the collection won\u2019t happen.\n\nSimple, right?\n\nFor the typical parent needing to navigate a \u2018woolly media landscape,\u2019 it\u2019s really difficult. \u2014Shelley Pasnik, director of the Center for Children & Technology\n\nFor the typical parent needing to navigate a \u2018woolly media landscape,\u2019 it\u2019s really difficult, said Shelley Pasnik, director of the Center for Children & Technology. Even when talking to parents who are focused on the content their kids consume, Pasnik finds the parents have \u201cno knowledge of COPPA.\u201d\n\nOne issue with the law is whether the site\u2019s makers consider it directed towards children under 13. For example, Google employees once said they didn\u2019t have users below 13, so they didn\u2019t need to follow the statute, according to court papers in the settlement.\n\n\u201cFrom its earliest days, YouTube has been a site for people over 13, but with a boom in family content and the rise of shared devices, the likelihood of children watching without supervision has increased,\u201d YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki noted in a statement on the settlement.\n\nWojcicki said the site will continue to recommend YouTube Kids for young viewers. YouTubeKids is a curated video site separate from the main YouTube site. It uses a less lucrative advertising model that isn\u2019t based on personalized advertisements, court papers say.\n\nAnd sites that openly target younger audiences can have tricky data-collection policies. \u201cMost of time, privacy policies are incomprehensible,\u201d Campbell said. She\u2019s been practicing law for 30 years \u2014 and she said she gets confused by some of the verbiage that can come up.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: 5 questions you should ask your bank before trusting it with your personal data\n\nFurthermore, many parents could sign off and give consent for their kids data to be collected, without actually reading the privacy policy. Studies have shown the majority of consumers breeze by the digital fine print.\n\nBesides, there\u2019s no mechanism in place to guarantee that the parent is the person giving the consent, Campbell said.\n\n\u2018Ongoing rights\u2019\n\nEven if parents agree to data collection, they are not signing away their children\u2019s rights forever.\n\nThe FTC notes parents have \u201congoing rights\u201d and companies have \u201ccontinuing obligations.\u201d If parents ask, companies need to give them a way to review the personal information collected from their child, the agency noted.\n\nParents can also rescind their consent and make websites delete their child\u2019s personal information, the FTC said.\n\nRoom for improvements?\n\nIn July, the FTC announced it wanted public input on whether COPPA needed an update. The law took effect in 2000 and its rules were last amended in 2013. The regulator is holding a public forum on possible changes next month.\n\n\u2018Most parents do not read privacy policies, and even if they do, many do not provide the information needed for informed consent.\u2019 \u2014Professor Angela Campbell, chair of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood\n\nCampbell\u2019s previously told the FTC that the law is outmoded in its current form. \u201cMost parents do not read privacy policies, and even if they do, many do not provide the information needed for informed consent,\u201d she wrote. Besides, the FTC hasn\u2019t \u201ceffectively enforced\u201d the law, and that lets \u201cmany companies feel free to ignore COPPA\u2019s requirements.\u201d\n\nIn March, Senators Ed Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, introduced a bill amending COPPA. Among other things, the bill says websites would have to ask for parents\u2019 permission on child data collection through age 15.\n\nAt the time, Markey said kids were now \u201cbombarded\u201d with advertising. \u201cIf we can agree on anything, it should be that children deserve strong and effective protections online,\u201d he said.\n\nAlphabet shares are up almost 17% from the start of the year.
