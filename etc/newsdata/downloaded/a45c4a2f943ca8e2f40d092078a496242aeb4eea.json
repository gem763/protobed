I had thought that this time around someone else might do it.\u201d\n\nThe Taliban have declared the poll illegitimate and said civilian voters should prepare to be targeted. Two deadly attacks targeting a vice-presidential candidate and an election rally have been carried out during the campaign and more violence is expected on the day despite a security deployment of more than 70,000 police, troops and intelligence officials.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Afghan security forces personnel stop a rickshaw at a checkpoint in Jalalabad on Friday.

One of those is led by Gen Abdul Rashid Dostum, a warlord accused of human rights abuses, who in both 2009 and 2014 backed Abdullah\u2019s rivals.\n\n\u201cI knew the difficulties of it, but I thought let\u2019s do it again,\u201d he said. He could be facing two gruelling campaigns: if no single candidate gets more than 50% of the vote in the first poll, Afghan law requires a second round.\n\nAbdullah\u2019s decision to stand again has in effect set up the vote on Saturday as a re-run of 2014\u2019s fraud and violence plagued poll that brought the country to the brink of political collapse.\n\n\u2018Voting means you\u2019re crazy\u2019: violence and fraud overshadow Afghanistan poll Read more\n\nThe results were so contested that the then US secretary of state, John Kerry, had to step in and negotiate a national unity government. Ghani became president, Abdullah his \u201cCEO\u201d, but the men spent the next five years feuding bitterly.\n\nNow there are fears that a repeat of the 2014 dispute could result in an even graver fallout. Abdullah has ruled out another unity government. \u201cWith the same gentleman? No,\u201d he said. Ghani has made a similar public pledge.\n\nUS diplomats have also reportedly made clear they do not want to be drawn into brokering another deal, leaving open the possibility that a festering political dispute could erupt into open conflict.\n\n\u201cThe bad scenario is an election result that is disputed in rounds one and two, and then we do not have sufficient national and international level intervention to bring the two sides to an agreement,\u201d said one senior Afghan source, who asked for anonymity to discuss sensitive scenarios. \u201cThis will further destabilise Afghanistan politically and could even lead to the collapse of the state.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Abdullah campaigning in Herat on Tuesday.

That will make the collapse of the state inevitable, even though it is not in the interests of anyone but terrorists.\u201d\n\nThe election is not officially a two-horse race. There are 18 candidates on the ballot paper, including the former insurgent leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who until 2016 led a faction that denounced elections and periodically attacked Kabul. But three have already dissolved their campaigns and of the remaining 15 only Abdullah and Ghani are thought to be real contenders.\n\nThe presidential poll was almost postponed to allow more time for peace talks with the Taliban, but after Donald Trump used Twitter to cancel an expected US deal with the militants at the start of the month, election plans were revived and campaigning restarted. Ghani has said it is vital to give the Afghan government a democratic mandate in future talks with insurgents.\n\nRecord insecurity has already disenfranchised millions. At least a third of the country\u2019s 7,384 polling centres will be closed for security reasons. There are also like to be more opportunities for fraud, which all sides agree is a given, although each campaign insists it will only be perpetrated by the opposition.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Workers transport ballot boxes and electoral material to polling stations in Kandahar on Friday.

But experts say campaigns may simply look for other ways to alter results, including voter intimidation and attempting to invalidate ballots cast for other candidates.\n\nEven if anti-fraud measures work, the legitimacy of the vote may also be undermined by low turnout: the most optimistic official and campaign estimates would represent barely half the votes counted in 2014.\n\n\u201cIn the past 18 years the nation of Afghanistan did its duty well. I voted and my family voted even in parliamentary elections,\u201d said Rahimullah Rezai, 55, a mechanic. \u201cBut our leaders did not do their duty, and now I have lost hope.\n\n\u201cIn this election we are expecting fraud, we are expecting explosions and there is no need to put our lives in danger to vote for Ghani or Abdullah.\u201d\n\nMokhtar Amiri in Kabul contributed to this report", "description": "Anti-Taliban resistance veteran faces off against old rival Ashraf Ghani in election on Saturday", "authors": ["Emma Graham-Harrison"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fb244eda0a1a5560ed165059f894bd60a00516a/0_208_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ce8e530145a06cc0081a8bf683019e43", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
