He is one of the highest-ranking officials to defect from the so-called Hermit Kingdom.\n\n\u201cSo even though they were taught that America is their sworn enemy, everyone has computers and knowledge\u2026 they know Bill Gates,\u201d he said, adding that North Korean millennials \u201care really thirsty for information. That's why they are different from their previous generations.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft founder Bill Gates speaks at the presidential Blue House in Seoul on April 22, 2013.

There is a rising trend of entrepreneurship among this group.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s class system\n\nSince insight into the country is rare, as data or research is not available because of how isolated the country remains, Thae\u2019s insights offered a glimpse of what life was like on the inside. For one, society was highly fragmented by a class system.\n\nThere were three socio-political classifications that were based on North Korean citizens\u2019 families, or their loyalty to the government, according to the Human Rights Watch\u2019s Phil Robertson. These three groups were called the \u201ccore,\u201d \u201cwavering,\u201d and \u201chostile\u201d classes.\n\nNorth Korean defector Thae Yong-ho, the former Ambassador for North Korea in London in Oslo, Norway in May 2019.

Peasants, laborers, and workers formed the second class. Those on the lowest rung were those who had opposed the elder Kim\u2019s regime, or had previously worked with South Korea or Japan.\n\n\u201cAnd your life \u2026 ranging from residence, employment, education, [is] decided by the class system,\u201d Thae explained. \u201cI was lucky to be born into the \u2018core\u2019 class, the ruling class. That's why I was able to get [an] elite education and a good job, and I lived in Pyongyang in good apartments\u2026 [but] there is a very strict class system structure in North Korea. ... North Korea is just like the feudal dynasty of the Middle Ages.\u201d\n\nDespite being part of the upper echelon, Thae said he definitely wasn\u2019t going to miss the life he left behind.\n\n\u201cThe Kim family does not care about the human rights of individuals,\u201d he stated. \u201cThey only care about their own interest.\u201d", "description": "Thae, who was North Korea\u2019s deputy ambassador to the United Kingdom, defected to South Korea in 2016.
