It is the first time in the tournament\u2019s 32-year history that any game has been axed.\n\n\u201cWe are continuing to review Sunday\u2019s matches and making every effort to ensure they will be played as scheduled,\u201d Gilpin added.\n\nSeven games were slated for the final weekend of the pool stage, when matches are tightly packed and cannot be rescheduled. Cancelled games are recorded as 0-0 draws, with both teams awarded two points.\n\nEngland and France are already qualified from Pool C, with England top of the group, but Pool A hangs in the balance ahead of Japan\u2019s final game against Scotland in Yokohama on Sunday.\n\nIf that game were to be abandoned it would be a disaster for the Scots, who would be eliminated, while Japan would go through to the quarter-finals as shock winners of Pool A with Ireland runners-up.\n\nAustralia\u2019s game against Georgia on Friday will go ahead, as will Saturday\u2019s match between Ireland and Samoa, which is in Fukuoka in Japan\u2019s southwest, out of the path of the storm.\n\nHagibis, packing maximum gusts of up to 270 kilometres (168 miles) per hour, is currently projected to hit the Tokyo and Yokohama area on Saturday.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Large and violent typhoon\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cIt is currently a large and violent typhoon. As it moves north and approaches Japan, it will be technically downgraded slightly to a \u2018very strong\u2019 typhoon,\u201d said a meteorologist at the Japan Meteorological Agency.\n\n\u201cBut the fact remains it will remain very strong when it arrives\u2026 This is a very large typhoon, which means it may have a significant impact in large areas,\u201d he added.\n\nFormula One organisers also said they were \u201cclosely monitoring\u201d the potential impact of Hagibis ahead of this weekend\u2019s Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, southwest of Tokyo.\n\nIn 2014, Marussia driver Jules Bianchi crashed in bad weather conditions caused by a typhoon, and remained in a coma until his death the following July.\n\nTyphoon Faxai, which struck Japan about two weeks before the World Cup, caused widespread disruption, leaving two people dead, cutting power supplies and causing the cancellation of more than 100 flights.\n\nHagibis is currently forecast to clip the southeastern corner of Japan near Tokyo and Yokohama, a similar trajectory to Faxai.\n\nIt is expected to weaken considerably as it approaches but Japan is still bracing for torrential rain and fierce winds from what forecasters have warned is one of the most powerful storms to hit the country in recent years.\n\nOrganisers have touted \u201crobust\u201d contingency plans for every eventuality after deciding to hold the tournament in Japan, subject to around 20 typhoons per year as well as being one of the most seismically active regions on Earth.\n\nFaxai made landfall in Chiba, east of Tokyo, on September 9, causing pandemonium including a lengthy black-out that affected half-a-million homes.\n\nThat storm also had an impact on some teams\u2019 arrivals at the Rugby World Cup. England were stranded for hours at Narita Airport and Australia delayed their arrival from Sydney.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Rugby World Cup organisers took the unprecedented step of cancelling games \u2014 England v France, and New Zealand v Italy \u2014", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/5f3487_it-is-time-in-tournament-32-year-history-game-has-cancelled-england-france-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
