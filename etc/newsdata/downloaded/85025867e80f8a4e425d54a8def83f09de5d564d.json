I think that's been one of our strengths this season but I thought that was non-existent in the second half.\n\n\"That needs sorting out because we don't want to be a team who is just defending in the box.\"", "description": "Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward is ready to hand Ole Gunnar Solskjaer huge funds to save Man United", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Getty Images", "Sascha Steinbach Epa-Efe Rex Shutterstock", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20732232.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MAIN-DMP_CHP__22020ManUtdLjnesJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
