The treaty no longer serves America\u2019s national security interests, and it is long past time the United States withdraw.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCotton added, \"The Open Skies Treaty could be more appropriately named the 'Russian Spies Over America Treaty.' America ought to withdraw from this flawed accord, which invites Russia to fly spy planes over our houses while Putin violates the treaty by restricting U.S. flights over Russia.\"\n\nThe treaty, which has been in effect since 2002, is intended to increase transparency and minimize military miscalculations among its 34 signatories.\n\nRepublicans have said for years that Russia was in violation of the pact by blocking flights over parts of its territory. Democrats have agreed that Russia's actions were concerning but have argued that they should be addressed while the U.S. remains part of the accord.\n\nDeputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, President Trump Donald John TrumpNumber of uninsured children rises for second year, tops 4 million Trump moment from White House Halloween trick-or-treat event goes viral White House official says transcript of Ukraine call omitted key phrases: report MORE's nominee to be ambassador to Russia, said Wednesday that the U.S. has not withdrawn from the treaty.\n\n\u201cThere would need to be substantial evidence to support the national security interest for withdrawal from that treaty, and there would need to be consultations with this committee, with Congress and, in particular, with our NATO allies and the other countries that are members of the treaty,\u201d he said during a confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nWithdrawing from the treaty would require a formal notice to its other members, launching a six-month exit process.", "description": "Sens.
