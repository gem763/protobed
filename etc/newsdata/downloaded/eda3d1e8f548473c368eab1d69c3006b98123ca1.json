NO! Must testify to explain why he got my Ukraine conversation sooo wrong,\" Mr Trump tweeted.\n\n\"We must determine the Whistleblower's identity to determine WHY this was done to the USA.\"\n\nThe White House's call memo shows Mr Trump sought a \"favour\" from Mr Zelensky. Democrats say it was a demand to investigate Mr Biden - the president's potential 2020 election rival - and a Ukrainian firm that hired Biden's son Hunter.\n\n'PREMEDITATED STRATEGY'\n\nMs Hill meanwhile appeared before congressional investigators despite the White House declaration last week that it would not cooperate with the probe.\n\nHer lawyer Lee Wolosky said Ms Hill had \"received a congressional subpoena\" to testify, suggesting top Democrats had feared the White House might seek an 11th-hour block to her testimony, as they did with previous witnesses.\n\nHouse Democrat Jamie Raskin said he believes Ms Hill could shed light on what he described as \"a very powerful shadow foreign policy being operated out of Ukraine by the president's lawyer Rudy Giuliani\" that bypassed normal channels in order to apply coercive pressure on Kiev.\n\n\"I think that she would have a comprehensive overview of that whole situation,\" Mr Raskin told MSNBC.\n\nMr Raskin said testimony from various witnesses also appears to confirm a \"deliberate, premeditated strategy by the president\" to condition some US$390 million in military assistance to Ukraine on that country investigating the Bidens.\n\nTestifying on Thursday will be US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, who shortly before Mr Trump's Ukraine call participated in several text messages with other US diplomats who expressed concern that Trump was seeking a quid pro quo for the military aid.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Mr Sondland intends to tell Congress that his text to a fellow diplomat denying such a trade-off was relayed directly to him by Mr Trump.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [WASHINGTON] US lawmakers returning from a two-week break braced for an impeachment brawl in Washington, as a former White House aide testified before Congress on Monday in the latest twist in the investigation of President Donald Trump. .
