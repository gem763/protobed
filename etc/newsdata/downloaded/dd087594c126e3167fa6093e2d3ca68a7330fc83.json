Lee and Stonewall Jackson. The men fought for the confederacy, even though Lee wasn\u2019t a die-hard secessionist or pro-slavery. And his actions after Appomattox all but guaranteed that no guerilla war would ensue after the Confederacy\u2019s formal surrender. He knew it was over and he told his troops that. He and Jackson are part of American history. That cannot be erased\u2014and both are some of the finest generals this nation has ever produced. The Battle of Chancellorsville, my favorite of the war, is a testament to that point. The city tried to say that the statutes were a 14th Amendment violation because it made people upset. The judge dismissed that garbage point and very plainly pointed out that it\u2019s illegal to remove war memorials within a locality (via WTOP):\n\nA judge in Charlottesville, Virginia has ruled the controversial statues to Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and Gen. Stonewall Jackson must stay.\n\nMore than two years after the Feb. 2017 vote by the Charlottesville City Council to remove the statue of Lee, which prompted a lawsuit against the city and was the impetus for what eventually became a deadly white nationalist rally, Circuit Court Judge Richard Moore ruled the memorials can\u2019t be touched.\n\n\u201cEven though the city wants to remove the statues, the judge said it can\u2019t,\u201d said reporter Hawes Spencer, who was in the courtroom during Wednesday\u2019s first day of the civil trial.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nSpencer said the judge said the statute preserving war memorials has been amended numerous times over the years, \u201cand that the iteration of it now existing is more about historical preservation than anything else.\u201d\n\nIn its defense, the city had argued preventing the removal of the statues violated the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment by sending a racist message to people of color.\n\nThe judge\u2019s ruling \u201creally took the rug out from under the city,\u201d said Spencer.\n\nSpencer said Moore explained his decision: \u201cHe said whatever the original intent of the memorial, and we can\u2019t really get into the heads of those who put these monuments to Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson up, today they exist as war memorials, and they are protected under Virginia law.\u201d", "description": ".10/02/2019 13:13:35PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/233/f3238f67-5a77-436f-9abf-e62902171076.jpg"}
