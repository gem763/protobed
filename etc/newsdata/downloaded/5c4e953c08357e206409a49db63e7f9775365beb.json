That seems to be the issue.\"\n\nWage growth in Australia has slowed significantly over the past five years. The wage price index grew at an annual average of 2.2 per cent in the five years to December 2018, compared with an average annual growth of 3.3 per cent in the previous five years to December 2013.\n\n'Easy option'\n\nMr Frawley warned that given the outlook for lower returns, the government should not choose the \"easy option of taking away savings, which will come back to bite them in the future\".\n\n\"I don\u2019t know what the answer is to generate wages growth, but it feels like they are trying to pull another lever to try to solve the wages growth problem,\" he said.\n\n\"They have targeted the low end, and they are precisely the people we need to try to help to create savings for in the future. People are aspirational. People want to live nicely in retirement. What are you doing by allowing people the ability not to save is just increasing the pension burden down the road.\"\n\nThe retirement income review will be headed by former Treasury official Mike Callaghan, and Future Fund director Carolyn Kay and Monash University professorial fellow Deborah Ralston will also be on the panel.\n\nThe panel will provide a final report to the government by June 2020.", "description": "Damien Frawley says the rate at which compulsory superannuation is paid should be flexible, possibly ranging from 7.5 per cent at the lower end to 12 per cent at the top.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.58%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_53%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/59bfe82f5ca13edb5fadf09f9a5590cb4f26fd9a", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
