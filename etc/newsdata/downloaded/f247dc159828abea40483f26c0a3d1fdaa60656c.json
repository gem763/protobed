It\u2019s exciting to see their work improve the lives of many people who have given up hope. And it\u2019s even more exciting to share these breakthroughs so that you can experience the same feeling. Naturally, I believe our work stands apart from other so-called gurus and health authorities, but there is one thing most of us do have in common: We are dispensing general health advice to a wide swath of readers and each of you is different than the other. Before you were born, your DNA was already different than the DNA of everyone else. On top of that, you may have health conditions that can adversely react to general health advice, such as changing your diet or lifestyle. For example, if you have food allergies it might not be wise to strictly follow a list of healthy foods that you found on the internet. Or if you have heart problems, you may have to consider an extra set of guidelines on top of general exercise recommendations. Yes, cardio is good for you but not in hot weather. There isn\u2019t\u2014and will never be\u2014a one-size-fits-all approach to medicine and health.

Those that do often carry a long list of possible side effects, which only further proves that each person reacts differently to specific treatments. So how do you know what health advice to follow? After all, it seems like nearly everyone with a keyboard has a strong opinion on what\n\nNew diet (especially the latest fad diet)\n\nExercise regimen\n\nSupplements\n\nMedical treatments\n\nSwitching/stopping medications\n\nyou need to do. That\u2019s what separates us from the pack. We may be health experts but we aren\u2019t your health experts. You and your doctor are. When considering any changes to your health and lifestyle, always consult with your doctor. They know what makes your body tick, what conditions you have, and how your body would react to changes such as:Bottom line: Always ask questions. Stay informed about general health, but understand how a specific recommendation might affect you before you take it to heart. And if the advice you\u2019re following is not working as you expected, stop taking it and talk to your doctor.", "description": "Here at Newport Natural Health, we work with cutting edge .09/02/2019 3:23:13AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
