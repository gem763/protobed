Now, just as we\u2019re starting to see \u201cwaterfall\u201d displays with extreme curved edges, Xiaomi is taking this to a wild new level with the Mi Mix Alpha.\n\nThe \u201csurround screen\u201d on the Alpha wraps entirely around the device to the point where it meets the camera module on the other side. The effect is of a phone that\u2019s almost completely made of screen, with status icons like network signal and battery charge level displayed on the side. Pressure-sensitive volume buttons are also shown on the side of the phone. Xiaomi is claiming more than 180 percent screen-to-body ratio, a stat that no longer makes any sense to cite at all.\n\nThe Mix Alpha uses Samsung\u2019s new 108-megapixel camera sensor, which was co-developed with Xiaomi. As with other recent high-resolution Samsung sensors, pixels are combined into 2x2 squares for better light sensitivity in low light, which in this case will produce 27-megapixel images.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to see how that works in practice, but the 1/1.33-inch sensor is unusually large for a phone and should give the Mix Alpha a lot of light-gathering capability. There\u2019s also no need for a selfie camera \u2014 you just turn the phone around and use the rear portion of the display as a viewfinder for the 108-megapixel shooter.\n\nAs for the phone\u2019s more traditional specs, there\u2019s a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ processor, 5G connectivity, 12GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, 40W wired fast-charging, and a 4,050mAh battery. That last spec would perhaps suggest that Xiaomi doesn\u2019t imagine you having the whole screen turned on all the time.\n\nXiaomi describes the Mix Alpha as a \u201cconcept smartphone\u201d and isn\u2019t going to be mass-producing it any time soon. The phone will go into small-scale production this year and go on sale in December for 19,999 yuan, or about $2,800. The original Mi Mix was also given the \u201cconcept\u201d label and released in small quantities, with the Mi Mix 2 following a year later as a more mainstream device.\n\nOn one hand, this design poses obvious issues with cost, durability, battery life, accidental touch recognition, privacy, and so on. On the other, well, just look at it:", "description": "The display wraps around the entire phone", "authors": ["Sam Byford", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_rxUpfjzTlM_-5Klf583oeRFTNE=/0x146:2880x1654/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19227736/Screen_Shot_2019_09_24_at_16.59.59__2_.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
