So this week, we're playing all Canadian political podcasts, with a little help from Elamin Abdelmahmoud, co-host of the CBC politics podcast Party Lines.\n\nAs the Canadian federal election draws closer, it's good practice to start asking questions to figure out the issues that matter most to you. But I get it\u2026 keeping up with politics can sometimes feel overwhelming, and for some, intimidating. Fortunately, CBC News and CBC Podcasts have put out a brand new pod just in time for the election campaign season. Party Lines \u2013 hosted by Rosemary Barton (The National) and Elamin Abdelmahmoud (BuzzFeed Canada) \u2013 is the perfect political primer for every kind of concerned citizen. Barton and Abdelmahmoud take listeners through the points Canadians should consider before voting day while making political gab graspable and fun. By the time October 21 rolls around, they'll have you ready to hit the polls.\n\n- Kelsey Cueva, Associate Producer, Podcast Playlist\n\nPodcasts featured this week:\n\nParty Lines \u2013 \"The polls suggest that a majority of Canadians (9 out of 10) see addressing climate change as 'important or urgent.' But do they behave and vote accordingly?\" Rosie and Elamin discuss political posturing and the state of the planet.\n\nThe Big Story \u2013 \"...we can absolutely reckon with the fact that photos of the Prime Minister in racist makeup have been uncovered, but we also need to reckon with the larger issue of systemic racism in Canada and in Canadian politics in particular. Can the first reckoning lead to the second? Or will we spend the next month pointing fingers?\"\n\nAttention Control with Kevin Newman \u2013 \"Francesca Fionda, AC's investigative correspondent, picks up the phone and finds out what our parties really do know about us.\"\n\nFront Burner \u2013 \"Globe and Mail health reporter Kelly Grant explains how the pharmacare debate is unfolding and what we can expect from the Liberals in the coming year.\"\n\nSandy & Nora Talk Politics \u2013 \"Sandy and Nora talk about Andrew Scheer's racist/homophobic candidate problem, each of the party's strategies to win and why Brampton is such an important place.\"\n\nWhat's your go-to #CdnPoli podcast?
