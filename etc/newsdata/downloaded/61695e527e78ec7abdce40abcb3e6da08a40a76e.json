This requires a European or, better still, a global identity standard. With every form of digital money, customers should be identified using a standard that is just as strict as that which banks and other obligated entities are required to apply under current legal framework pursuing the combat against money laundering and terrorist financing.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to Bankenverband, a competitive payment system can only be based on a common standard and a common currency. It stated, \u201cIn order to maintain Europe\u2019s competitiveness, satisfy customers\u2019 needs and reduce transaction costs, the introduction of euro-based, programmable digital money should be considered.\u201d\n\nAlthough the private German banks are convinced that, in a digitized economy, this form of digital money will rapidly gain in importance, they state that the existing monetary system must not \u201cbe endangered by the provision of crypto-based digital money.\"\n\nA private global digital currency, such as Facebook's Libra, competing with the official key currencies in the world economy would most likely be a source of considerable economic and political conflict, the paper adds.\n\nThe banks further call on national and international policymakers to act responsibly and assure that competition with private currencies should not be allowed.\n\nWhile a digital euro seems appealing, German officials criticize crypto\n\nThe German finance minister Olaf Scholz echoed similar sentiments when he recently advocated for the idea of launching a digital euro coin, stating that such a digital payment system would be beneficial for Europe and that they \u201cshould not leave the field to China, Russia, the U.S. or any private providers.\n\nMario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, recently said that private stablecoins and cryptocurrency in general are of little value, adding:\n\n\u201cThus far, stablecoins and crypto-assets have had limited implications in these areas and are not designed in ways that make them suitable substitutes for money.\u201d\n\nThe president of the European Central Bank is joined in his sentiments by the German federal parliament, which recently released a statement in which they said that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) are not real money.\n\nMoreover, the statement points out that stablecoins are no alternative to fiat money and explains that the government intends to limit their adoption:", "description": "The Association of German Banks released a paper in which it says that the economy needs the digital euro", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9jMmZlNzkzNTY4ZmMxNjJjYWE0ZGFhYWJkYWFhZWVkMi5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
