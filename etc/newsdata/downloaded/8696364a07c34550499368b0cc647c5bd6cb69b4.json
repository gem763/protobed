Kelly, Trump\u2019s second chief of staff until resigning late last year, understands that the president was honoring his campaign promise to end \u201cendless wars.\u201d But he said Trump\u2019s policy could backfire, with devastating repercussions for the homeland.\n\n\u201cI want to get out of the endless wars, too. The problem is, the other side, even if we wanted to surrender, will not take our surrender. They hate us because of who we are, the way we live our lives, the way we worship our God,\u201d Kelly said Saturday during a panel discussion at the Sea Island Summit, a political conference hosted by the Washington Examiner.\n\n\u201cWhat was working in Syria was that for very little investment, the Kurds were doing all the fighting, the vast majority of the dying, and we were providing intelligence and fire support assistance. And we were winning,\u201d Kelly added.\n\nEarlier Saturday, Kelly recalled for attendees of the Sea Island Summit that he warned Trump before resigning as chief of staff that the president risked being impeached if he did not surround himself with firm advisers willing to keep him in check.\n\nKelly, 69, was Trump\u2019s homeland security secretary before becoming White House chief of staff. He is hardly alone in his criticism of the president's decision to halt military operations in Syria. Trump first signaled plans to remove American troops from the region in December, prompting James Mattis, also a retired Marine general, to resign as defense secretary. The president finally pulled the trigger this month, sparking a backlash from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress.\n\nThey are complaining that the move has left America\u2019s Kurdish allies to the mercy Turkey, a country that considers them sworn enemies. It is a stain on the honor of the United States, they argue, though Trump claims a ceasefire he brokered has stopped the bloodshed. Lawmakers\u2019 larger concerns are that the redeployment has diminished the influence of the U.S. in the region and could allow ISIS to reconstitute.\n\nKelly, calling the policy a \u201ccatastrophically bad idea,\u201d offered a similar critique.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t happen while I was there \u2014 and a couple of other people recently left the administration and then he went with his instinct,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cBut it was, on a number of levels, the wrong thing to do and it has opened the way for the Russians to be very, very influential in the Middle East.\u201d", "description": "SEA ISLAND, Georgia \u2014 John Kelly, the former White House chief of staff, is calling President Trump\u2019s decision to remove American troops from northern Syria a \u201ccatastrophically bad idea\u201d that is harming U.S. national security and boosting Russia\u2019s influence in the Middle East.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/224bc40/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1648x865+0+117/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F6e%2Fde%2F8609a56e4330ab6b1e47973db590%2Fimage3.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
