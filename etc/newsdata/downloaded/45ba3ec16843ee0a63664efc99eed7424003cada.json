Not only will I shoot you, I will get a grenade.'\n\n(Image: Mark Thomas / i-Images)\n\n\"When told by the police to stop shouting and swearing, he then said, 'You f**king n****r.' When told to stop again, he replied to an officer, 'I will stab you in the kidney, I will stab you in the windpipe.'\n\n\"Ironically the manager he assaulted was the person trying to help him,\" Mr Pakenham said, adding that it was an \"unprovoked attack\".\n\nWhen he was interviewed by police the next day, Quaye said he had not eaten properly since arriving at 4pm to rehearse for his show and couldn't remember very much.\n\nHe described the bar manager as a \"diamond\" who he had always enjoyed a good relationship with.\n\n\"Mr Quaye accepts that he has got an alcohol problem,\" Shahnaz Sargent, defending, told the court.\n\n(Image: SWNS.COM)\n\nHe had been drinking all day. He has performed there on several occasions and is in fact very ashamed of his behaviour. He accepts that he was out of order.\"\n\nSentencing him to 200 hours of unpaid work and a rehabilitation order, Judge Michael Snow said: \"What makes this offence serious is the level of culpability involved - before the punch you made considerable threats that would have caused significant fear, then you punched this man in the face.\"\n\n\n\nHe was also ordered to pay costs and a fine totalling \u00a3525 - the court heard Quaye is on benefits and offered to pay the sum at the rate of \u00a315 a week.\n\n\n\nWhen asked if he had any work coming up he replied: \"No, not for lack of trying.\"\n\nJudge Snow said: \"If you go around thumping managers in the face, I don't suppose you are going to get much work.\"\n\nThe court heard Quaye has 14 previous \u00adconvictions relating to alcohol.\n\nHis convictions include one of aggravated assault in 2012 and cannabis possession in 2003.\n\nHe was also convicted of assault in 2016 after headbutting a terminally ill friend in a row over Game Of Thrones.\n\nQuaye scooped a Brit Award in 1998 for Best British Male Solo Artist, following the release of his million-selling debut album Maverick a Strike.\n\nHowever he was bankrupted in 2012, owing the taxman \u00a3383,000.", "description": "The 1990s reggae singer Finley Quaye pleaded guilty to punching a bar manager in the face at his own gig", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Vickie Flores Lnp", "Mark Thomas", "I-Images", "Swns.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20577517.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Finley-Quaye-sentenced-for-assault.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
