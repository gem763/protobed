The app has been missing from the store since November 16th, but until now the reason for its absence was unclear \u2014 initially Tumblr simply said it was \u201cworking to resolve the issue with the iOS app.\u201d However, after Download.com approached Tumblr with sources claiming that the reason was related to the discovery of child pornography on the service, the Yahoo-owned social media network issued a new statement confirming the matter.\n\nIn its updated statement, Tumblr said that while every image uploaded to the platform is \u201cscanned against an industry database of child sexual abuse material\u201d to filter out explicit images, a \u201croutine audit\u201d discovered content that was absent from the database, allowing it to slip through the filter. Although Tumblr says the content was immediately removed, its app continues to be unavailable on the App Store. It\u2019s still available in the Google Play store for Android users, however.\n\nTumblr has been noted for having a permissive attitude towards NSFW and adult-orientated content on its service, which has previously caused it to be briefly banned in Indonesia. However, child pornography is a completely different matter. Apple\u2019s iOS guidelines clearly state that all apps must have a content filter to screen out such material, and it seems Tumblr\u2019s existing system wasn\u2019t up to this standard. Although the company has said getting its app reinstated is its \u201ctop priority,\u201d it was unable to give any clear timeframe for its return.", "description": "Tumblr says that child pornography was the reason for its app\u2019s sudden disappearance from the iOS App Store.
