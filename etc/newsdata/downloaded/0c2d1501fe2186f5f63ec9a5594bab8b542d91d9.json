Because, I had lost myself a bit.\u2019\n\nSorry, this video isn't available any more.\n\nAnge stars at the evil fairy (Picture: Disney Enterprises, Inc)\n\nClarifying, she added: \u2018I think it happened as my relationship with Brad was coming to an end, then at the beginning of our separation. It was a complicated moment, where I didn\u2019t recognise myself anymore, where I had become\u2026 how can I say\u2026 smaller, almost insignificant, even if it wasn\u2019t necessarily visible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I felt a deep and genuine sadness, I was hurt. On the other hand, it was interesting to reconnect with this humility and even this insignificance I was feeling. Maybe this is what being human is in the end\u2026 On top of all this, I suffered some health issues. All these things settle in you and remind you of how lucky you are of being alive.\u2019\n\nSpeaking to French magazine Madame, the mum-of-six went on to say that rediscovering joy is a lesson she wants to teach her children.\n\nMaleficent: Mistress Of Evil is in UK cinemas 18 October.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
