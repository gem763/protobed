The vast majority of what was announced today was already announced in the past.\n\nAnd of course none of this has to be implemented if an election is triggered in the coming weeks - something most people expect.\n\nPlus, it faces being voted down for the first time since 1924 as the PM struggles to govern with a majority hovering near minus 50.\n\nShadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: \"This Queen's Speech is farcical.\n\n\"It is just an uncosted wish list which the Government has no intention and no means to deliver, and nothing more than a pre-election party political broadcast.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nMeasures to let workers keep tips and reform divorce law will finally be brought back after the Tories dragged their feet.\n\nBoris Johnson claimed an Environment Bill will be the \"huge star\" of his programme - weeks after Labour backed reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2030 - by imposing new charges on some single use plastics.\n\nThere will be legislation to keep serious criminals in prison for longer, impose tougher sentences on foreign offenders who return to the UK and provide better protection for victims of domestic abuse.\n\n(Image: POOL/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nBrexit is of course there too - with measures to end free movement, pass a Brexit deal and carry over trade deals between the UK and EU.\n\nAnd the PM forced the Queen to read out his \"priority\" of leaving the EU by October 31.\n\nBoris Johnson bullishly claimed the speech will \"get the gears on our national gearbox working again\" as he sung the praises of the NHS and police.\n\nThe Prime Minister added: \"This Queen's Speech delivers on my promise as PM to get this amazing country of ours moving again. People are tired of stasis, gridlock and waiting for change.\"\n\nTHE BREXIT DEAL\n\n1. EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe first Bill in the Queen's Speech will implement any Brexit deal Boris Johnson gets with the EU.\n\nIt will aim to put into law a new way to prevent checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. It will also confirm a transition period, running to December 2020, where we continue to follow EU rules and send money to the EU.\n\nWe all knew about this already. But crucially, turning it into an Act of Parliament allows MPs to have a vote on Boris Johnson's deal.\n\nIf he gets it, that is. The PM has until Wednesday to work out something that can be put to 27 EU leaders at a crucial summit on Thursday.\n\n2. Fisheries Bill\n\nPowers to control access to UK waters will be enshrined in law with licences for foreign vessels - which will no longer have the automatic right to access our seas.\n\nNew powers will impose restrictions on UK fishermen - either quotas or number of days at sea - to replace the current Common Fisheries Policy.\n\nGrants would also be available to fishermen to \"conserve, enhance and restore the marine and aquatic environment\".\n\nAnd EU law could be amended to allow the UK to respond to new advice on fish stocks.\n\n3. Agriculture Bill\n\nThe Bill will set up a seven-year transition period that \"gradually reduces\" payments to farmers that came under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy.\n\nThe current subsidy system - which rewards the amount of land owned - will be replaced and focus on action farmers take to farm sustainably and help the environment.\n\n4. Trade Bill\n\nThe Bill allows the legal \"carry-over\" of trade deals that the UK currently enjoys as an EU member.\n\nHowever, this carrying over is still not automatic and the UK would need to negotiate the transition with individual countries around the world.\n\nThe Bill also establishes a \"new independent UK body\" to protect British firms against unfair trade practices - like dumping of imports such as Chinese steel.\n\nCRACKDOWN ON FREE MOVEMENT\n\n5. Immigration and Social Security Co-Ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThis is the flagship Bill to end free movement after Brexit - including forcing checks on EU citizens who come to Britain from January 2021.\n\nIt will pave the way for an Australia-style points-based system, which Ukip has previously backed.\n\nIt would score potential migrants based on their education, skills and expected salary level.\n\nBut Home Secretary Priti Patel drew scorn after saying she wants to make the system more generous to people willing to live outside London.\n\nOffering preferential treatment to migrants who agree to live in the North of England was branded \u201cconfused\u201d and an unworkable \u201cgimmick\u201d - with Labour saying it would do nothing to solve the shortage of workers in the NHS.\n\nThe Bill doesn't actually introduce this points-based system - just sets up a framework for it. It will also ensure Irish citizens \"generally\" can enter and live in the UK freely. And it will confirm the deadline of December 2020 for new EU arrivals to apply to stay - with or without a Brexit deal.\n\n6. Financial Services Bill\n\nThis Bill will \"simplify the process which allows overseas investment funds to be sold in the UK\".\n\nThe government has trumpeted this as a cutting of red tape, while upholding the UK's \"world-leading\" standards. But it could prompt fears from some about letting financial markets run free.\n\nThe Bill also allows for long-term market access to the UK for financial services firms based in Gibraltar.\n\n7. Private International Law (Implementation of Agreements) Bill\n\nThis Bill is designed to \"clarify\" the law on disputes over kids that stretch across national borders.\n\nIt involves three treaties - the 1996, 2005 and 2007 Hague Conventions.\n\nThey include making it harder for parents who leave the country to evade paying child maintenance; and allowing co-operation between governments on family cases.\n\n8. Health Service Safety Investigations Bill\n\nA new Health Service Safety Investigations Body will have powers to conduct investigations into NHS incidents that have implications for patient safety.\n\nPeople will be banned from leaking or publishing information held by this body, to ensure witnesses and whistleblowers more candid.\n\nThere will also be a duty on the Health Secretary to ensure enough medical examiners are appointed in England.\n\nAnd advice, guidance and training will be provided to local bodies to improve medical probes.\n\nHARDLINE TREATMENT OF SERIOUS PRISONERS\n\n9. Sentencing Bill\n\nViolent criminals and sex offenders will face longer sentences in a tough justice crackdown.\n\nThe point where prisoners are usually released will be moved from halfway through a sentence to two-thirds - for adults serving at least four years for serious violent and sexual offenders.\n\nThe focus appears to be a U-turn on previous Tory bids to focus on rehabilitation, which would have removed the need for the shortest sentences in favour of community work.\n\nThe Bill will also extend the range of reasons a judge can use to slap a \"whole life\" prison term on a convicted murderer.\n\n10. Foreign National Offenders Bill\n\nThe law and order package includes a bill to \"drastically\" increase the sentences for foreign criminals who return to the UK in breach of a deportation order.\n\nThe exact increase however isn't actually spelt out in the Queen's Speech.\n\nMinisters claim the move will help disrupt the activities of international crime gangs. Home Secretary Priti Patel said: \"We have been a soft touch on foreign criminals for too long.\"\n\nHELEN'S LAW\n\n11. Prisoners (Disclosure of Information About Victims) Bill\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nA new law will make it easier to deny parole to murderers, or those guilty of manslaughter, who refuse to say where their victims are buried.\n\nThe same law will apply to people who take indecent photographs of children while refusing to say who those children were.\n\nThe law will be known as \"Helen's Law\" after 22-year-old Helen McCourt who was murdered in 1988 - leading to a long campaign by her mother Marie.\n\nHer murderer was convicted but has refused to say where he hid her body.\n\nDespite claims by ministers, the law won't actually force Parole Boards to keep these murderers and paedophiles locked up. Instead it will put a \"legal obligation\" on them to \"take into account\" the issue when considering release.\n\n12. Serious Violence Bill\n\nThere will be a new legal duty on agencies like councils, schools, social services and health providers to work together and share data to \"prevent serious violence\".\n\nThis will include introducing an \"explicit priority\" in law on serious violence for Community Safety Partnerships.\n\nIt comes after a surge in knife attacks. But critics are likely to complain it is shifting the burden onto cuts-hit local authorities.\n\nPROTECTION FOR POLICE OVER CAR CHASES\n\n13. Police Protections Bill\n\nPolice will face a new test to grade their driving - which can then be taken into account if they end up being investigated over a crash.\n\nThis is in a bid to stop police facing prosecution unfairly for people they injure or kill when taking part in a car chase.\n\nThe Bill will also force the Home Office to report annually on progress on the Police Covenant. And Special Constables (volunteers) will be able to to get the same support as members of the Police Federation.\n\nFUGITIVES ARRESTED WITHOUT A WARRANT\n\n14. Extradition (Provisional Arrest) Bill\n\nThis is designed to make it easier for police to arrest internationally wanted fugitives - without the need to apply for a UK arrest warrant.\n\nThe idea is to cut out a waiting period of six to eight hours which fugitives can use to evade justice.\n\nThose being arrested must be subject of an Interpol Red notice.\n\nInitially it will only apply to those issued by a limited number of countries with trusted justice systems, the other members of the Five Eyes intelligence group, the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, and two non-EU European states, Switzerland and Liechtenstein.\n\nHowever the Government will be able to add other countries by minor laws, possibly with minimal scrutiny in Parliament.\n\nDOMESTIC ABUSE AND DIVORCE REFORMS FINALLY RETURN\n\n15. Domestic Abuse Bill\n\nThe Tories will bring back the Domestic Abuse Bill - which fell as a result of Mr Johnson's unlawful suspension of Parliament.\n\nThis law was introduced under Theresa May but still wasn't implemented, to the fury of campaigners.\n\nIt will stop abusers from being able to cross-examine their victims in the family courts. Victims will be assumed eligible for special measures in criminal courts, like giving evidence via video link.\n\nIt will create a statutory definition of domestic abuse to include physical violence, emotional abuse, economic abuse and coercive control.\n\nAnd a Domestic Abuse Commissioner will monitor the response of councils and the justice system.\n\n16. Divorce, Dissolution and Separation Bill\n\nPlans for 'quickie' divorces will also come forward again after being stalled under the Tories.\n\nReforms will remove the need to prove bad \"conduct\" or a \"period of separation\".\n\nInstead couples will be able to just tell a court their marriage has irretrievably broken down. And an obstructive partner will no longer be able to contest a divorce from happening.\n\nIn those measures' place will be a 20-week waiting period between the start of proceedings and the final order for a divorce.\n\nLONG-DELAYED PLANS TO LET WORKERS KEEP TIPS\n\n17. Employment (Allocation of Tips) Bill\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nRestaurants will be forced to hand over tips to staff - more than three years after the Tories first promised to crack down on abuses.\n\nThe new law in the Queen's Speech will force employers to pass on all gratuities in full and to share fairly any pooled tips.\n\nThe Tories first promised to tackle the injustice under then-business secretary Sajid Javid who ordered a two-month consultation ending on June 27, 2016.\n\nBut Theresa May then failed to bring in the change during her time in office.\n\nToday the Employment (Allocation of Tips) Bill also introduces a Code of Practice for restaurants, bars and cafes to make the system transparent.\n\nTen years ago, the Mirror launched our Fair Tips campaign with Unite the Union after a Pizza Express manager was sacked for revealing that the company kept 8% of tips paid by bank cards as an \u201cadministration fee\u201d.\n\n18. Pension Schemes Bill\n\nOn pensions there were new rules planned around everything from saving to viewing to accessing your money.\n\nFirst was saving \u2013 with plans announced for new \u201ccollective\u201d workplace pensions schemes. These would see staff and firms pay into a single, shared, pot rather than individual pots for each person. The idea is that it could be more efficient and offer better value.\n\nSecond there were plans to force firms to take part in the new \u201cpensions dashboard\u201d project - this is set to be a single location where you can see all your retirement savings at once. But unless everyone gets involved it won't work. So plans to force firms to take part are a needed first step.\n\nFinally there were new rules planned about where, when and to who you can transfer your pension to. These are needed as there have been cases where scammers have convinced people to move their money, and honest firms have been powerless to stop it.\n\nOn a more technical front, there were also bigger penalties and criminal offences planned for firms that break pensions rules and better protection for people saving when companies go bust.\n\n19. Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill\n\nThis will aim to roll out \"gigabit capable broadband across the UK to achieve nationwide coverage as soon as possible\".\n\nThe government claims it will allow faster speeds that can download an HD film in fewer than 45 seconds.\n\nAll new build buildings will need the infrastructure to support gigabit connections. And they will have to be installed in most new-build homes.\n\nNEW POWERS TO TACKLE DRONES\n\n(Image: POOL/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n20. Air Traffic Management and Unmanned Aircraft Bill\n\nPolice will be given new powers to tackle the \"unlawful use\" of drones.\n\nThis include forcing a person to land a drone and \"enhanced stop and search powers\" if an offence involving an unmanned aircraft has taken place.\n\nThe laws will also apply to model planes and model helicopters.\n\nIt comes after the number of drone or model aircraft collisions skyrocketed from 6 in 2014 to 125 in 2018 - including a spate of shutdowns of Gatwick Airport in a mystery that still hasn't been resolved.\n\nNEW CHARGES ON SINGLE USE PLASTICS\n\n21. Environment Bill\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nThe government has responded to pressure to ramp up environmental protection. It comes as critics warn that the UK's regulations will be weaker than the EU's once Brexit happens.\n\nThe new moves include introducing charges for single use plastics following on from the carrier bag charge.\n\nCouncils will be given powers to clamp down on sources of air pollution.\n\nWhile communities will have more of a say on the protection of natural habitats through the Local Nature Recovery Strategies.\n\nThe Queen's Speech confirms the creation of a new Office for Environmental Protection first announced last December.\n\nIt will have the power to take the government to court to enforce environmental law after Brexit.\n\nClimate change has been pushed up the agenda in recent months with protests organised by groups including Extinction Rebellion and the international school strikes begun by Sweedish teen Greta Thunberg.\n\nBoris Johnson's girlfriend Carrie Symonds, who is a senior adviser for US environmental campaign group Oceana, has urged politicians to act saying they have a \"gigantic responsibility\" to care for the environment.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nFIVE YEARS' JAIL FOR ANIMAL ABUSERS\n\n22. Animal Welfare (Sentencing) Bill\n\nThe maximum sentence for animal cruelty offences will be massively ramped up from six months to five years - confirming plans already announced under the Tories.\n\nThere will also be a \"clear statement in domestic law that animals are sentient beings\", following a controversy some years ago.\n\nAnd there will be a duty on government to have \"all due regard to the welfare of sentient animals\" when forming and running new policies.\n\nWhat else is in the Queen's Speech?\n\nMany measures are in the Queen's Speech - or the briefing documents around it - that aren't spelt out fully in the speech as one of the 22 Bills. These include:\n\nVoter ID crackdown to 'rig the election'\n\nBoris Johnson has been accused of using Monday's Queen\u2019s Speech as a \u201cblatant\u201d attempt to rig the result of the next election.\n\nThe Queen's Speech paves the way for measures to force voters to show photo ID before being allowed to vote.\n\nHundreds of people were denied their right to vote in last year\u2019s local elections after ministers forced through a pilot scheme, despite warnings it could disenfranchise older voters and people from minority groups.\n\nThe trial, which was held in eight council areas, resulted in 819 people being turned away.\n\nYet figures show there were just eight allegations of people lying about who they are at a polling station - known as \"personation\" - in 2018.\n\nThat was down from 28 in 2017, 45 in 2016, 26 in 2015 and 21 in 2014, the Electoral Commission figures show.\n\nA White Paper on mental health\n\nThere will be a White Paper \"by the end of this year\" setting out the government's response to possible reforms to the Mental Health Act.\n\nIt comes after pleas for patients not to be detained \"any more than is absolutely necessary\" and ensure their views are respected.\n\nHowever there are no immediate plans for a new law in the coming Parliament.\n\nTory pledges on NHS and police\n\nThe Queen's Speech will sit alongside measures already announced to invest in the NHS, strengthen environmental protections and raise living standards through increasing the national living wage to \u00a310.50 an hour by 2024 for over-21s.\n\nAlso mentioned is the pledge to hire 20,000 more police officers... which almost but not quite reverses Tory cuts to numbers since 2010.\n\nStopping a repeat of Thomas Cook\n\nA new law will attempt to stop a repeat of the Thomas Cook debacle by giving the Civil Aviation Authority oversight over airlines in distress. There aren't confirmed plans or a set Bill yet.\n\nSix other Bills\n\nThere are six Bills not mentioned by the Queen herself in addition to the 22. They include allowing the building of part of HS2 - despite the risk the rail line will be scrapped altogether in a government review.\n\nIt also involves a Bill to make it easier for NHS hospitals to manufacture and trial medicines and medical devices.\n\nOther technical Bills will allow further payments under the Windrush compensation scheme to Brits who arrived from the Caribbean before the 1970s - and technical changes to legal sentencing in the criminal courts.\n\nWhat ISN'T in the Queen's Speech now?\n\nA firm plan for social care\n\nThe Tories have kicked the can down the road on social care yet again with no plans for the ailing sector contained in the Queen's Speech.\n\nDespite promising an \"optimistic and ambitious\" programme of domestic legislation, the Prime Minister has failed to set out how to tackle the growing crisis.\n\nTheresa May was accused of kicking the can down the road after she repeatedly delayed plans for a \u2018green paper\u2019 on social care first planned for summer 2017.\n\nHer blighted social care plans in the 2017 general election campaign were dubbed a \u201cdementia tax\u201d and blamed for the Tories losing their majority in the 2017 general election.\n\nDuring the Tory leadership contest, Boris Johnson said he had a reform plan ready to go once he arrived in office.\n\nBut so far there has been no suggestion of what the government would actually do.\n\nImmediate punishments for Grenfell-style building owners\n\nThe speech documents talk of a \"fundamental change\" in the regulations on high-rise tower blocks to ensure \"accountability and responsibility\" from their owners.\n\nOver the weekend there was talk of this leading to criminal sanctions.\n\nBut there is no mention in the Queen's Speech documents of criminal sanctions and no firm law.\n\nRail reforms now\n\nThere will be a White Paper \"later this autumn\" on reforms to the rail industry and reforms \"from 2020\". But reforms to the franchising model - which were briefed out ahead of time - are not certain yet and there's no firm Bill to make changes in the next year.\n\nA Bill on online harms\n\nMinisters will \"continue to develop proposals\" to improve internet safety for children and vulnerable people. But there's no Bill announced yet.", "description": "The Queen's Speech includes measures to lock up criminals for longer, help domestic abuse victims, reform quickie divorces, let workers keep tips and impose tax on single-use plastics.
