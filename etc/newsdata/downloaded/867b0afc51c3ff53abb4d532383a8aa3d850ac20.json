Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Monday released a plan that would eliminate some of the last unrestrained corporate spending in Democratic politics, by banning corporate funding for the party\u2019s nominating convention and presidential inauguration events.\n\nSanders\u2019 proposal to \u201cget corporate money out of politics\u201d \u2015 the first plan his presidential campaign has released since he was hospitalized for a heart attack last week \u2015 would, among other things, ensure public financing of federal elections, create a new federal elections oversight board, prohibit advertising during presidential primary debates, and enact a lifetime lobbying ban for former members of Congress and top staffers.\n\nBut replacing corporations\u2019 sponsorship of the Democratic National Convention with a public financing system is both the most ambitious and the most controversial element of Sanders\u2019 proposal. Seventeen donors were responsible for contributing three-quarters of the funding for the party\u2019s 2016 convention in Philadelphia, including a $5.6 million in-kind donation from Comcast for broadcast and internet services.\n\nSanders said his own campaign\u2019s success raising money in small increments \u2015 he topped the Democratic presidential field with a $25.3 million haul in the third quarter of this year \u2015 shows that corporate money and wealthy donors are not necessary.\n\n\u201cOur grassroots-funded campaign is proving every single day that you don\u2019t need billionaires and private fundraisers to run for president,\u201d Sanders said in a statement accompanying the plan. \u201cWhen we win the Democratic nomination and defeat Donald Trump, we will transform our political system by rejecting the influence of big corporate money.\u201d\n\nPreston Ehrler/SOPA Images/Getty Images Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), seen here campaigning in New Hampshire on Sept. 30, is taking aim at corporate influence in the Democratic Party's nominating convention.\n\nSome of the other changes Sanders proposes include banning lobbyist and corporate PAC donations to the Democratic National Committee if he is the Democratic presidential nominee, barring former DNC chairs and vice chairs from lobbying, and capping individual contributions to official inauguration committees at $500. He would also seek to pass a constitutional amendment clarifying that money is not equivalent to speech and that corporations do not have the legal status of individuals, thereby eliminating key legal justifications for court rulings striking down campaign finance regulations.\n\nAs Democrats have grown warier of corporate influence in politics, the party\u2019s national convention every four years \u2014 which is overwhelmed by corporate spending and lobbyist influence peddling \u2014 has attracted more scrutiny from good government advocates and progressive activists.\n\nMeanwhile, the DNC\u2019s convention CEO, Joe Solmonese, has already set out to court corporate sponsors to raise upward of $70 million for the party\u2019s nominating convention in Milwaukee in July 2020. Perks for six-figure donors include VIP convention credentials and box seats to attend the proceedings.\n\nThat makes the convention a natural target for Sanders, an independent who has long been antagonistic toward the donors and insiders that play an outsize role in Democratic Party politics.\n\n\u201cWhen Bernie is the nominee, everything will fundamentally change for corporate elites,\u201d Josh Orton, the Sanders campaign\u2019s policy director, said in a statement. \u201cA Bernie Sanders convention will be a people-powered convention.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 proposal is likely to raise questions about his ability and willingness to compete with President Donald Trump, who will have virtually limitless cash to finance a rival convention. A convention provides a political party a key opportunity to introduce its presidential and vice presidential nominees to a national audience on live television.\n\nOf course, it is much easier to swear off high-dollar private fundraisers \u2015 as Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have done \u2015 in a presidential primary. It is harder to replace multimillion-dollar corporate checks that come in for the convention than the $2,800 checks that closed-door fundraisers earn candidates in primaries.\n\nSanders\u2019 proposal differs from that of Warren, a fellow economic populist who has surpassed him in national and early-state primary polls. In an anti-corruption proposal released in September, Warren suggested a lifetime ban on lobbying for former members of Congress, presidents, vice presidents, Cabinet secretaries and federal judges. But she does not yet have a major plan to reform campaign financing, including how the national political conventions are financed.\n\nWarren has also said that she would resume soliciting big checks in private fundraisers if she were the Democratic presidential nominee, arguing that to do otherwise would amount to \u201cunilateral disarmament\u201d against Trump and the Republicans. Sanders, by contrast, has said he would not change his ban on the policy.", "description": "His plan to end the influence of major businesses goes further than that of other 2020 candidates.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9aa3f6210000250432a540.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
