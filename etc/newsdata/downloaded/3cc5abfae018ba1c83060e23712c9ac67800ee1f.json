Mortgage rates may be cheap but homes are considerably more expensive compared to their wages (green line)\n\nOwner-occupation rates by age group Age 1996 2006 2016 16-24 25.30% 22.80% 10.60% 25-34 61.10% 56.10% 39.60% 35-44 73.40% 71.20% 59.00% 45-54 79.20% 77.60% 69.40% 55-64 76.00% 80.20% 75.30% 65-74 69.20% 76.50% 78.80% 75 and over 58.60% 69.90% 76.70% Source: House of Commons library\n\nFears younger generation will miss out on buying\n\nThe group's study reported a marked reduction in homeownership rates among younger households compared to the rates seen in earlier generations.\n\nIn 2016, less than 40 per cent of 25-34 year olds owned their own home compared to over 60 per cent in 1996.\n\nThe most dramatic fall was in the 16-24 age group between 2006 and 2016, which saw home ownership fall from one in five households in 2006 to little more than one in 10 in 2016.\n\nHome ownership levels for those aged between 35 and 64 also fell. At the same time, for 65-74 year olds and over 75s owner occupation rates rose.\n\nA combination of high rents, significantly higher house prices, and tighter mortgage lending rules since the financial crash mean it's now tougher to get onto the housing ladder than it was 15 years ago.\n\nHowever, historically low mortgage rates mean monthly repayments are low compared to rents, which have continued to rise over the same period.\n\nThis can make saving for a deposit difficult, especially in areas where house prices are high.\n\nAnd while the number of first-time buyers is climbing, overall you are less likely now to own a home if you are between the ages of 16 and 64 than in 1996, the year the government began recording the figures.\n\nGeorgie Laming of campaign group Generation Rent said: 'Renters are typically spending more than 40 per cent of their income on rent meaning that any hope of owning their own home is disappearing rapidly.\n\n'On average two thirds of renters have no saving whatsoever so while in the long run buying a home is the better option, this isn't on the table.'", "description": "A new report found that that making monthly mortgage payments instead of paying rent could yield \u00a3133,700 in savings over 30 years.", "authors": ["Will Kirkman For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
