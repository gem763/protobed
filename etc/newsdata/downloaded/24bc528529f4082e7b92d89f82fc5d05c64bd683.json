Here's what they thought would be funny for Halloween...racists! They demonstrated complete lack of empathy when people complained. They owe their town a public apology. Shame on them,' Jason Heinrich commented.\n\nMary Joslin added: 'Racist and violent display. Vote with your $. Don't go here!'\n\n'Lacks judgement, lacks respect.

Well done! #MAGA2020 ,' was among some of the supportive posts.\n\nHuff has refused to address the comments publicly via the business' page.\n\nHis refusal to apologize sparked more of a backlash in the community.\n\n'What a genuinely awful Halloween display this company put up.
