(AP) - Nigel Bradham picked off Aaron Rodgers\u2018 pass in the end zone with 20 seconds left, Jordan Howard gashed Green Bay for his second career three-touchdown game and the Philadelphia Eagles ended a two-game losing streak with a 34-27 victory over the Packers on Thursday night.\n\n\u201cTo have an opportunity to go to war with a quarterback like that, it\u2019s going to be tough,\u201d Bradham said. \u201c\u2026 But the thing is just staying in there and keep fighting, never losing your composure.\u201d\n\nHoward finished with 87 yards on 15 carries and two touchdowns rushing and one receiving, Carson Wentz went 16 for 27 for 160 yards, three scores and no turnovers, and the Eagles (2-2) rebounded after losing consecutive games by a combined seven points.\n\n\u201cWe already were confident,\u201d Howard said. \u201cWe already believed in ourselves. It probably reassured everybody else. We already believed in ourselves because the last two games, we could\u2019ve made a lot of excuses, but we came up short with all the things against us. But we just came out fighting.\u201d\n\nRodgers started 10 for 10 and finished 34 for 53 for 422 yards, two touchdowns and a fumble that set up a short Philadelphia scoring drive.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to build on, and the frustrating thing is a home game, a winnable game, a good opponent, that we just didn\u2019t execute the way we should\u2019ve to win that football game,\u201d Rodgers said.\n\nDavante Adams had a career-high 180 yards on 10 catches for Green Bay, but he wasn\u2019t on the field for the Packers (3-1) on the last drive because of a toe injury.\n\n\u201cObviously, having him out there would have been for the better, but we had a lot of chances down the stretch,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cWe moved the ball well all day long. We just struggled in the red zone.\u201d\n\nGreen Bay went 3 for 7 from the red zone, while the Eagles were a perfect 4 for 4.\n\nAfter punting on its first two drives and falling behind 10-0, Philadelphia scored on four straight possessions against a defense that had only given up 35 points through the first three games.\n\nSacked six times in the previous two games, Wentz managed to stay clean throughout most of the game. Zach Ertz had a team-high seven catches for 65 yards, and Alshon Jeffery, who missed all but six snaps over the past two weeks with a calf injury, finished with 38 yards and a touchdown on three catches.\n\nRunning back Jamaal Williams caught a pass from Rodgers for no gain and was leveled by defensive Derek Barnett on Green Bay\u2019s first play from scrimmage. Williams was wheeled off on a stretcher and did not return. Barnett was hit with an unnecessary roughness penalty. Williams was being evaluated for head and neck injuries. The Packers said Williams had feeling in his extremities.\n\nWilliams turned out to be the first of a plethora of injuries on the night for both teams. Eagles cornerback Avonte Maddox was carted off the field on a stretcher late in the fourth quarter.\n\nHe has movement in all of his extremities and he\u2019s being checked for precautionary reasons right now,\u201d Eagles coach Doug Pederson said of Maddox.\n\nRodgers and Adams connected on a 58-yard completion on the opening drive. It was the longest play of the season for Green Bay, which continued its trend of hot starts. Aaron Jones scored from 3 yards out two plays later to give the Packers the early lead.\n\nRodgers was 4 of 4 for 71 yards on the opening drive.\n\nMason Crosby added a field goal in the beginning of the second quarter to make it 10-0.\n\nThe Eagles finally got a little momentum on a 67-yard return by Miles Sanders on the ensuing kickoff. The return set up a 6-yard score by Jeffery.\n\nRodgers and Adams linked up again for a 40-yard gain on the next drive, which again ended in a field goal for Green Bay to give the Packers a 13-7 lead.\n\nWentz found tight end Dallas Goedert for a 3-yard touchdown strike. The score gave the Eagles a 14-13 lead just before the two-minute warning.\n\nRodgers fumbled on the following drive after a strip-sack by Barnett. The Eagles capitalized with 1-yard score by Howard. Howard\u2019s touchdown made it 21-13 with 54 seconds to go.\n\nRodgers needed just 50 seconds to lead the Packers 70 yards. The two-time MVP found Geronimo Allison for a 31-yard gain, and the pair linked up for a 19-yard touchdown to make it 21-20 at the half.\n\nThe Eagles opened the second half with a 20-yard score from Wentz to Howard. After a failed two-point conversion, Philadelphia led 27-20.\n\nJimmy Graham got his first catch and score since Week 1. Graham had six catches for 61 yards and a 14-yard touchdown that tied the game at 27-27 with 3:16 to go in the third.\n\nHoward scored his third touchdown on a 2-yard run that made it 34-27 at the start of the fourth.\n\n\u201cBottom line is find a way to win, and we did,\u201d Pederson said.\n\nThe Eagles picked up the victory despite committing nine penalties for 93 yards.\n\nCLIMBING THE RECORD BOOKS\n\nRodgers passed Fran Tarkenton for sole possession of ninth place in NFL history with 344 career passing touchdown. Eli Manning sits in eighth place with 362.\n\nINJURIES\n\nEagles: CB Sidney Jones suffered a hamstring injury and did not return. That leaves Philadelphia with only two healthy cornerbacks - Rasul Douglas and Craig James - on the roster.\n\nPackers: CB Tony Brown suffered a hamstring injury and did not return. RT Bryan Bulaga left with a shoulder injury. He also did not return. S Will Redmond was being evaluated for a concussion. CB Kevin King suffered a groin injury. Adams suffered an injured toe.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nEagles: Host New York Jets on Oct. 6\n\nPackers: At Dallas on Oct. 6.\n\n___\n\nFollow Keith Jenkins on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MrKeithJenkins\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Nigel Bradham picked off Aaron Rodgers' pass in the end zone with 20 seconds left, Jordan Howard gashed Green Bay for his second career three-touchdown game and the Philadelphia Eagles ended a two-game losing streak with a 34-27 victory over the Packers on Thursday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Keith Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/eagles_packers_football_04700_c0-180-4310-2692_s1770x1032.jpg?1c368d416f6e9b8383ac107a93a743170ded22c3", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
