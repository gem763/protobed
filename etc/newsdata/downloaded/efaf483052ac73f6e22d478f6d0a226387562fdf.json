A year later secrets and unanswered questions remain", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE A year after the Schoharie limo crash left 20 people dead, officials still haven't determined an official cause, and families want answers. Georgie Silvarole, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle\n\nALBANY, N.Y. \u2013 The New York limousine crash that killed 20 people remains shrouded in secrecy nearly a year later.\n\nFrom public safety probes to legal battles over possible fault, the unanswered questions from the Schoharie County crash cast a pall over the lives shattered by the nation\u2019s deadliest crash in more than a decade.\n\n\"A year later, nothing has changed,\" several of the victims' families said in a statement. \"No one has been held accountable for this tragedy, and this delayed justice keeps our families in limbo reliving the traumatic loss of our loved ones.\"\n\nDonna Rivenburg, whose daughter Amanda died in the crash, said she wants answers.\n\n\"I just go day by day waiting for a final outcome,\" she said.\n\nCentral to the unanswered questions is why, according to authorities and court records, a limousine with documented safety problems and improper certifications didn\u2019t get removed from roadways.\n\n20 people diedin a horrific limo crash. A year later, loved ones talk about life and loss\n\nSafety recommendations: NTSB issues new safety recommendations for limo seating, seat belts\n\nThe limo\u2019s owners and operators, including Nauman Hussain, who faces a slew of criminal charges, used it for a job that turned a birthday celebration into a historic tragedy Oct. 6, 2018.\n\nA clash between local officials and federal investigators over analyzing the wreckage has delayed the resolution and potentially compromised efforts to improve limousine safety across the country, federal records show.\n\nThe 2001 Ford Excursion stretch limousine involved in the Oct. 6, 2018, crash in Schoharie, New York, that killed 20 came to rest in a ravine. (Photo: New York State Police/NTSB)\n\nFederal investigators issued new safety recommendations Wednesday to improve dangerous seating issues in limousines connected to the Schoharie crash, but they have yet to determine a cause.\n\n\u201cThe crash raises a number of important issues that people may not be aware of,\u201d said Russ Rader, a spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a national group dedicated to reducing roadway deaths. \u201cThis was a perfect storm of a lot of bad things happening together.\u201d\n\nWhy are the investigations incomplete?\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board criticized Schoharie District Attorney Susan Mallery for stymieing a federal investigation into the crash.\n\nMallery refused to give NTSB investigators access to the limo wreckage for months, arguing it could disrupt the criminal case. A judge intervened and granted federal investigators access in January, but the delay still looms over the federal safety review.\n\nSchoharie rallies: Community still coming to terms with tragedy\n\nNew York laws: Why laws didn't prevent deadly crash\n\n\u201cThe investigation would be further along had we been able to follow our standard processes for the collection of evidence,\u201d NTSB spokesman Eric Weiss said Sept. 16.\n\nNTSB officials cited concerns about perishable investigative information, such as corrosion on the vehicle\u2019s brakes, being lost because of the delays.\n\nSimilarly, the criminal trial for Hussain was postponed to January 2020 \u2013 it was initially set for September \u2013 in part because defense attorneys cited delays in gaining access to the limo wreckage.\n\n\u201cWe are still seeking justice and hoping the investigation and prosecution prevents tragedies like this from occurring in the future,\" the families' statement read.\n\nOne year ago, a limousine crash in Schoharie claimed the lives of 17 passengers, the driver and two pedestrians. Lost in the tragedy were sisters, brothers and married couples. One passenger died on his birthday, while another was celebrating her forthcoming birthday. Read their stories\n\nWas it the brakes?\n\nThough an official cause hasn't been determined, a state expert\u2019s report concluded the 2001 Ford Excursion stretch limo's brakes failed as it barreled down a hill on Route 30, killing all 17 passengers, the limo driver and two pedestrians.\n\nMany details about the condition of the limo\u2019s brakes and overall maintenance remain unclear, court records show.\n\nUp to the courts: Who is to blame for deadly limo crash?\n\nCharges: Limo company operator indicted in crash that killed 20 people in upstate New York\n\nA roadside Department of Transportation inspection of the limo in March 2018 determined at least 25% of the brakes were defective and a hydraulic brake line was constricted, resulting in it getting an \u201cout-of-service\u201d sticker, court records show.\n\nAfter that inspection and before the crash, a Mavis Discount Tire shop allegedly performed repairs on the limo\u2019s mechanical defects, including its brakes, according to a lawsuit filed against Mavis and officials of Prestige Limousine and Chauffeur Services, the limo business.\n\nA New York state trooper and members of the National Transportation Safety Board view the scene of the Oct. 6, 2018, fatal crash in Schoharie, New York, on Oct. 7, 2018. All 17 passengers, the driver and two pedestrians were killed in the crash. (Photo: Hans Pennink, AP)\n\nState agencies denied requests for all the limo\u2019s inspection records, citing exemptions to Freedom of Information Law, said attorney Paul Davenport, representing family members of Erin and Shane McGowan, newlyweds from Amsterdam killed in the crash.\n\n\u201cAll the victims deserve justice and deserve to know what happened here and deserve to know who was responsible,\u201d Davenport said.\n\nMavis contended it \"bears no legal responsibility for this tragedy and the events that led up to it, and we will defend ourselves vigorously against all claims.\"\n\nLawsuit: First suit filed in horrific New York limo accident that killed 20\n\nProblems: Limo in deadly New York crash 'should have been in the scrapyard': AC didn't work; it had painted duct tape\n\nThe DMV declined to answer questions about its oversight of the Mavis shop, citing pending litigation. It didn't immediately answer USA TODAY Network requests for public records related to the limo crash.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe NTSB's new safety recommendations focus on the lack of lap-and-shoulder seat belts in limousines, as well as modifications made to stretch models that reduce the chances passengers can survive crashes.\n\nFailed inspection: Limo in fatal New York crash failed inspection; driver lacked 'appropriate' license: Cuomo\n\nTragedy: 'Horrific' limo crash kills 20 in upstate New York\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when the NTSB will release its final report on the cause of the crash, and potentially additional safety recommendations.\n\nFollow David Robinson on Twitter: @DRobinsonLoHud\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/03/new-york-limo-crash-unanswered-questions/3843937002/", "description": "Among the unanswered questions: Why a limousine with documented safety problems and improper certifications didn\u2019t get removed from New York roadways.", "authors": ["David Robinson", "Published A.M.
