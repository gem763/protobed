I have seen it with Raheem Sterling, with Lewis Hamilton. I cannot win whatever I do.\n\n\u2018It is very disappointing to see you guys going at it again and again.\n\n\u2018The headline is \u2018Farah, Farah, Farah\u2019. There is no allegation against me. I\u2019ve not done anything wrong. Let\u2019s be clear: these allegations are about Alberto Salazar and the Oregon Project.\u2019\n\nThe four-time Olympic champion has faced constant scrutiny since an investigation was launched into Salazar following a 2015 Panorama documentary.\n\nBut Farah insists the recent ruling has nothing to do with him and he says he\u2019s the \u2018most tested athlete\u2019 in the world.\n\n\u2018This is not about Mo Farah, this is about Alberto Salazar. I am not Alberto.\n\n\u2018I was never given anything. I am not on testosterone or whatever it is. At the time I never saw any wrongdoing when I was there. This allegation is about Salazar, not Mo Farah.\u201d\n\n\u2018I have not done anything wrong. I have not failed any tests and I am happy to be tested anytime anywhere.\n\n\u2018I feel let down by you guys to be honest, there is no allegation against me.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s taken four years for Usada to get to this position it has right now. The first time I am hearing it is when you guys are reporting it.\u2019\n\nMORE: Unai Emery could lose Arsenal job if Gunners fail to qualify for Champions League", "description": "Sir Mo Farah accused the media of having a racist agenda against him after being questioned about his links to disgraced coach Alberto Salazar.
