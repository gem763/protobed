And he categorically denied it,' Carol told the Illawarra Mercury.\n\n'I said ''look, I know you're a Christian, you have Christian faith, and so do I... did you do it or not? Because if you want to speak to a priest we can arrange it''.'\n\nCarol said he then began 'rattling off' reasons why he couldn't have committed the crimes.\n\nMilat - Australia's worst serial killer - was thought to have been on his deathbed, making his recovery nothing short of miraculous\n\nShe said she apologised to Milat for asking but told him 'everyone wants to know' and 'we know you didn't do it'.\n\nCarol said they've been punished 'all this time' because of her surname.\n\nBill said they questioned Milat about the killings because everyone wants a 'deathbed confession'.\n\nHe added that he was with Milat during three days where crimes took place.\n\n'Mac is upset because it has affected all of us, but like I said many times before, people still believe Lindy Chamberlain is guilty even though she was exonerated. They are never gonna change their mind no matter what the truth is,' Bill said.", "description": "Backpacker killer Ivan Milat has been returned to prison after yet another stint in hospital, where family members had rushed to be by his side, believing he was on his death bed.", "authors": ["Hannah Moore", "Zoe Zaczek For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/02/20111370-0-image-a-9_1571879091887.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
