The shares fell.\n\nThe Pittsburgh-based company cited a December fire at its Clairton coke-making facility and restructuring charges. It expects a loss of 35 cents a shares for this quarter, compared with a 6-cent loss that was the average estimate of analysts, the company said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nOn Monday, Nucor Corp., the largest U.S. steelmaker, fell after saying its profit waned in the third quarter as prices decreased amid softening in several end markets. On Tuesday, Steel Dynamics Inc. said profit would fall short of estimates. The shares plunged 8% in after-hours trading.\n\n\u201cThis speaks to the emerging weakness in the energy sector in U.S., it speaks to pervasive weakness in Europe as well,\u201d Phil Gibbs, an analyst at Keybanc Capital Markets, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThey\u2019re not getting help anywhere right now.\u201d\n\nSteelmakers raised some prices earlier this quarter, but buyers have been slow to accept the increases, underscoring fading optimism more than a year after the introduction of U.S. tariffs meant to bolster the industry.\n\nU.S. Steel also said it\u2019s more almost three-quarters of the way toward its goal of reducing its European workforce by 2,500 by the end of 2021. The company has eliminated 1,800 jobs in that region, according to the statement.\n\nThe company expects third-quarter 2019 adjusted EBITDA to be about $115 million, which excludes approximately $53 million of estimated impacts from the fire.\n\n--With assistance from Steven Frank.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Joe Richter in New York at jrichter1@bloomberg.net;Joe Deaux in New York at jdeaux@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Reg Gale\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- U.S. Steel Corp. said it expects to report a wider loss than analysts were expecting, the third American steelmaker in three days to warn on their outlook.
