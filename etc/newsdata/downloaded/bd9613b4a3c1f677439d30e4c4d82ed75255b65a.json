Retail and proxy investors have also criticised the draft standard.\n\n\"I think they have misread Hayne's recommendation,\" Mr Bradley said. \"It is actually inconsistent with Hayne, which recommends that boards take greater responsibility and be accountable to investors.\"\n\nBut the consumer bodies rejected the business leaders' assessment.\n\n\"It\u2019s very clear that APRA has read Hayne right,\" Mr Veyret told the Financial Review. \"Commissioner Hayne explicitly recommended that APRA set limits on the use of financial metrics for variable remuneration.\"\n\nRecommendation 5.3 of the Hayne royal commission's final report suggested that APRA revise its prudential standards to \"set limits on the use of financial metrics in connection with long-term variable remuneration\".\n\nThe Narev protocol\n\nIn addition to banning sales-based bonuses, the joint consumer bodies called on APRA to prohibit boards from approving bonuses of any kind for executives in companies that have been found guilty of a\"significant breach of the law\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In spite of widespread misconduct, the industry continues to reward executives with large bonuses,\" the submission stated. \"We maintain deep scepticism that boards are incentivised to claw back or block bonuses, even when misconduct occurs.\"\n\nThe submission gives the example of former Commonwealth Bank chief executive Ian Narev, who received a 108 per cent short-term bonus in the 2017 financial year, despite the AUSTRAC money laundering, CommInsure medical records and financial advice fees-for-no-service scandals occurring during that period.\n\nComplaints about the relevant company or individual to internal and external dispute resolution bodies should also be taken into account when allocating bonuses, the submission argued.\n\n'Wolf in sheep's clothing'\n\nThe joint submission took aim at so-called balanced scorecards used by some financial institutions to determine performance bonuses based on competing factors including customer service, risk management, leadership and financial metrics.\n\n\"Balanced scorecards are a wolf in sheep's clothing,\" the consumer bodies wrote. \"These scoreboards merely pay lip service to being customer focused while rewarding staff for pushing products to consumers.\"\n\nThe submission referenced a royal commission case study examining ANZ's internal scorecard for bonuses, which weighted \"financial and discipline\" matters at 30 per cent of the score, well above the 15 per cent each allocated to \"people and reputation\" and \"risk and process\" and only marginally behind the 35 per cent attributed to \"customer\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The banking royal commission found that the 'customer' key result area was a thinly veiled guise for ANZ to reward staff for selling more products,\" the submission stated. \"The latitude given to firms to essentially equate good consumer outcomes with more products sold in a balanced scorecard lies at the heart of the problem.\"\n\nThe submission also called on APRA to stipulate that the commonly used net promoter score (NPS) no longer be relied upon as a measure of good consumer outcomes.\n\n\"The NPS conflates the perceived friendliness or trustworthiness of the banking staff member with the quality of the product, service or advice provided,\" the submission said.\n\nAPRA is due to release a post-consultation final standard by the end of this year, which is expected to take effect in 2021.", "description": "The prudential regulator's edict that 50 per cent of banker bonuses must be from non-financial metrics should be extended, say consumer advocacy groups.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6464%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/06832889e0884b61082a154d8f4a780c553790a7", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
