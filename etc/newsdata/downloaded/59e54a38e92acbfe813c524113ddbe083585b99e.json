While the department is buying more aircraft with each purchase, its price per plane has decreased substantially in recent years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis agreement represents our continued commitment to reduce F-35 costs aggressively and incentivize industry to meet required performance,\u201d Lord said.\n\nThe program is still having problems in reaching a defense-wide goal to keep 80 percent of the fighter jets mission-capable. The Air Force in particular has long struggled to keep its aging jets battle-worthy.\n\nBut the F-35 is a relatively new jet, with new models only recently starting to roll off Lockheed\u2019s production line at a full rate. The Defense Department said it is lagging in the production of certain spare parts, including the cockpit canopy, engine fuel tubes and wingtip lenses, Lord said Tuesday.\n\nThe department has also been working to remedy certain production challenges created by the departure of Turkey from the F-35 program. Turkey was shut out of the program earlier this year after it agreed to purchase a Russian-made missile system.\n\nAD", "description": "The deal includes 470 fighter jets for the Army, Navy, Marines and allied partners.
