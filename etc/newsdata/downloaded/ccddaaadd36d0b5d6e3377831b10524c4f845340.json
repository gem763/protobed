(AP) - As long as John Mooney keeps putting up double-doubles and his teammates stay healthy, coach Mike Brey feels pretty good about Notre Dame\u2019s chances this season.\n\n\u201cJohnny carries a lot of clout in our league when you hear the other coaches,\u201d Brey said as he prepares for his 20th season at Notre Dame. \u201cWe take him for granted - he just rolls out of bed and goes 15 (points) and 12 (rebounds) like it\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n\nThe 6-foot-9 senior Mooney averaged team highs of 14.1 points and 11.2 rebounds last season for the Fighting Irish, who lost 63 games to injuries and illnesses during a 14-19 campaign that included just three wins and a last-place finish in the Atlantic Coast Conference.\n\n\u201cThey had their back sides handed to them . we\u2019re older, we\u2019re healthier, we\u2019re better,\u201d Brey said.\n\nThe return to health of guards Robby Carmody, Rex Pflueger, Nikola Djogo and forward Juwan Durham, the maturation of sophomores Prentiss Hubb, Dane Goodwin, Nate Laszewski and Chris Doherty, and senior T.J. Gibbs making amends for his junior slump have created excitement for the season opener Nov. 6 at North Carolina.\n\n\u201cThe guys are playing at a higher level, sharing the basketball and feeding off each other,\u201d Mooney said. \u201cComing off last year, no one\u2019s giving us a shot. So we have to play with a chip on our shoulder to get the job done and prove these people wrong.\u201d\n\nHubb, who started 29 games at point guard, thinks Mooney\u2019s leadership is just fine, even if his coach would like more confidence from his standout.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a role model for everyone on this team,\u201d said Hubb, who averaged 8.1 points and nearly four assists last season.\n\nRALLYING AROUND REX\n\nThings went south quickly for the Irish after Pflueger, averaging 8.1 points and 4.7 rebounds at the time, tore left knee ligaments last December. The injury came at the same time his mother was diagnosed with brain cancer. She died early in September and the team attended her memorial service in California.\n\n\u201cSome of the stuff they\u2019ve gone through with Rex and his mother\u2019s situation - that\u2019s kind of done some things to our team\u2019s dynamic,\u201d Brey said.\n\n\u201cIt speaks highly of our coaching staff and players,\u201d said Pflueger, now a grad student working on his MBA who is not being rushed to be ready for the opener. \u201cIt\u2019s an act of kindness you don\u2019t see often.\u201d\n\nMEDIC\n\nIn addition to Pflueger missing the final 23 games following knee surgery, Carmody missed his final 24 and Djogo his final six with torn labrums that were surgically repaired. The 6-foot-11 Durham, who missed six games with leg issues, averaged 2.3 blocks when healthy in 27 games.\n\nTHE HUBB\n\nBrey likes what he sees in the 6-foot-3 Hubb at the point. \u201cHe moves more confidently and is more vocal,\u201d Brey said. \u201cHe and T.J. (Gibbs) have been pretty good.\u201d\n\nBEAT THE CLOCK\n\nInstead of the usual 30-second shot clock, Brey used a 20-second version during the preseason.\n\n\u201cThat way we have to play quick and you can\u2019t think too much. You\u2019ve got to make a decision,\u201d he said.\n\nSCHEDULE\n\nBesides North Carolina, the Irish host Boston College on Dec. 7 in the pre-holiday portion of the 20-game ACC schedule. Notre Dame also has non-conference games with Maryland, UCLA and Indiana before starting the final 18 games of league play at Syracuse Jan. 4.\n\nBrey said he and Orange coach Jim Boeheim talked about the league\u2019s big three - North Carolina, Duke and defending champion Virginia - on the summer scouting trail.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018You know, we\u2019re all playing for fourth,\u2019\u201d chuckled Brey, whose team is picked seventh. \u201cHe never minces words, obviously.\u201d\n\n__\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "As long as John Mooney keeps putting up double-doubles and his teammates stay healthy, coach Mike Brey feels pretty good about Notre Dame's chances this season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Fineran"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/notre_dame_preview_basketball_56796_c0-261-3918-2546_s1200x700.jpg?04160cc55d46956b7092b86b285cdcac1701c598", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
