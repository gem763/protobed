I was completely unable to walk anywhere by myself without being overcome by fear.\n\n'The stress and anxiety caused meant that I was unable to focus or revise as I was continuously crying (and) feeling unsafe even in my own home.'\n\nShe said for several weeks she was 'scared to walk by myself, with my parents having to pick me up and drop me off'.\n\nGriffiths was convicted of two charges of sexual assault by Manchester Magistrates. He was ordered to do 12-month community order with 200 hours' unpaid work as well as signing the Sex Offenders' Register for the next five years\n\nShe added: 'Every time I go to the place the first incident took place my heart stops and I mentally prepare myself to see him there.\n\n'All of this happening when I'm in my final year at school I'm afraid it will have affected my grades and potentially my future.'\n\nGriffiths, who lives with his parents in a \u00a3650,000 house in the affluent town of Knutsford, Cheshire, faced a potential jail sentence after he was convicted of two charges of sexual assault by Manchester Magistrates.\n\nBut he was ordered to complete a 12-month community order with 200 hours' unpaid work and sign the Sex Offenders' Register for the next five years.\n\nHe must also pay his victim \u00a3250.\n\nGriffiths, a first-year criminology student who is now studying at Durham University, had denied the charges.\n\nHe claimed he was a 'shy, anxious and awkward' teenager who had clumsily approached the girl in an attempt 'to make a friend but the words didn't come out'.\n\nGriffiths claimed he was a 'shy, anxious and awkward' teenager who had clumsily approached the girl in an attempt 'to make a friend but the words didn't come out'\n\nThe incidents occurred between October and November last year whilst the pair were studying A levels.\n\nThe girl, now 18, said she had been walking home from an English lesson when she encountered Griffiths on a railway bridge bordering fields in the town.\n\nHe touched her on the arm as she tried to avoid him and he walked away, but she said she encountered Griffiths again at lunchtime as she was on her way to school to sit a timed English essay having been revising at home.\n\nDescribing the encounter, she told the court: 'The pavement was quite wide but he suddenly moved to walk in front of me, looked me straight in the eye and touches me on my side and walked off.\n\n'It was quite a while - three to five seconds. He smirked at me, he didn't stop he just touched me and walked off and I broke down crying in the street - it was quite traumatic.\n\n'I had reported the previous incident to the police days beforehand as (news) had been going around that other incidents had occurred and I thought I could give more evidence and then it happened again.\n\n'I felt very unsafe even in my own home (and) couldn't walk to school for a couple of weeks. I wouldn't leave the house myself.\n\n'Even today, walking down the street it just makes everything a little bit scarier if there is a guy walking towards me by himself I start to panic - it is just part of everyday life.'\n\nIt was not revealed in court whether the victim, now 18, has herself started a university course or deferred her application.\n\nGriffiths was further ordered to pay costs of \u00a3735 plus a further \u00a378 for damaging a teacher's chair during an unrelated incident.\n\nHe is banned from contacting the victim for 12 months under the terms of a restraining order.\n\nClaire Aldridge, defending, said the offence occurred whilst his client had been going through a 'difficult time' when he was forced to re-sit a year at high school.\n\nShe said: 'He deeply regrets reaching out to touch the complainant and he apologises for any stress caused to her.'\n\nMiss Aldridge described Griffiths as a 'very, very quiet young man' - but said he hopes to be able to continue with his university course despite his conviction, having made a 'good start'.\n\n'He wants to address his issues and move forward,' she added.", "description": "Jamie Griffiths, from\u00a0Knutsford, Cheshire, faced a potential jail sentence after he was convicted of two charges of sexual assault by Manchester Magistrates.", "authors": ["Richard Marsden For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/23/20106176-0-image-a-88_1571868883216.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
