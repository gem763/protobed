About 49,000 United Auto Workers have been on strike since Sept. 16, resulting in manufacturing stoppages across the continent\u2019s deeply integrated supply chain.\n\n\u201cThe resulting decline in GM orders are currently estimated to impact Linamar earnings at a rate of up to $1 million CAD/day of strike,\u201d Linamar stated in an investor update on market conditions that have changed since it last released financial results in August.\n\nLinamar\u2019s stock fell more than 10 per cent to close at $36.74 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n\nGM is Linamar\u2019s second largest customer, chief executive Linda Hasenfratz said in an email. Her company supplies a wide range of components and systems to GM for \u201cnearly every vehicle produced in North America.\u201d\n\nLinamar did not disclose details about production cuts or how many employees have been affected because the number changes as it reallocates work.\n\n\u201cWe have had to layoff some people but are reallocating them into other lines needing people as best we can,\u201d Hasenfratz said.\n\nIn its statement to investors, Linamar noted the potential opportunity to buy up other suppliers that are struggling with the expected downturn in global light vehicle production.\n\n\u201cOn the plus side, we are seeing more in the way of conquest or takeover business due to failing suppliers that will positively impact future sales, a key advantage for Linamar thanks to our rapid response capabilities and flexible equipment philosophy.\u201d\n\nOther Canadian autoparts suppliers are also feeling the crunch from the work stoppages in the U.S., where workers are fighting for better health care and wages. The conflict, which Citi Group Inc. analyst Itay Michaeli estimates could cost GM $100 million per day, comes at a transitional time for the automaker. GM is cutting back some vehicle production, including one plant in Canada and four in the U.S., to invest instead in automation and electrification.\n\nNearly 5,000 Canadian workers have been temporarily laid off during the disruption, including the majority of workers at GM\u2019s plants in Oshawa and St. Catharines and an additional 1,700 workers at autoparts suppliers, according to national union Unifor.\n\nAurora, Ont.-based Magna International Inc., North America\u2019s largest autoparts supplier, has also had to idle a few plants because of the strike, although it is not releasing details about production cuts, layoffs or costs.\n\n\u201cWhile we attempted to keep our employees at these impacted plants working as long as possible through training, maintenance and inventory, a few of our GM dedicated plants are now idle,\u201d spokeswoman Tracy Fuerst said in an email.\n\n\u201cWe are continuing to monitor the situation and we remain hopeful for an amicable resolution.\u201d\n\nThe stoppages are frustrating for autoparts suppliers that aren\u2019t at the negotiating table and therefore have no control over a resolution, said Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers\u2019 Association.\n\n\u201cThe reality is if somebody\u2019s not making a car, they\u2019re not going to take delivery of your seat. If you can\u2019t send the seat, you\u2019re not buying the foam or the springs, and it just trickles all the way down,\u201d Volpe said.\n\nAuto parts suppliers employ about 100,000 people in Canada, with about 10,000 working in firms that supply GM, Volpe said. No one is solely supplying GM, he said, so workers can be reassigned to different jobs or upkeep. But that work doesn\u2019t last long.\n\n\u201cYou run out of that after a while,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hurting everybody.\u201d\n\nThe disruption adds to lower sales figures for the automotive industry this fall. Light vehicle sales in Canada fell about 3.7 per cent in September, with a 12.2 per cent decrease in GM units purchased, according to a report by DesRosiers Automotive Consultants.\n\n\u2022 Email: ejackson@nationalpost.com | Twitter: theemilyjackson", "description": "Magna International Inc., North America\u2019s largest autoparts supplier, has also had to idle a few plants because of the strike", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/linamar.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
