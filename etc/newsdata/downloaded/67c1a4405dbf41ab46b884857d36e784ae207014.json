The state Democratic Party, meanwhile, sent some voters a robocall recorded by former President Barack Obama. The minute-long robocall featured Obama praising Edwards for expanding Medicaid in the state.\n\nBut national and state Republicans made a heavy push in the closing week of the race to hold Edwards below 50 percent. President Donald Trump held an election-eve campaign rally in Lake Charles on Friday night, standing alongside both Rispone and Abraham as he urged Louisianans to vote for one of the GOP candidates and deny Edwards the outright victory.\n\nThe two Republicans appeared at similar events over the past week with Vice President Mike Pence and Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s son.\n\nBut despite the unified front, both men attacked one another on the airwaves and in the media. Rispone, a long-time donor but first-time candidate, sought frequent comparisons with Trump as a conservative outsider. He hit Abraham, a third-term congressman who did not have to risk his House seat to run in the off-year race, for his voting record and breaking a promise to donate his federal salary.\n\nLouisiana is one of three states holding gubernatorial elections in 2019, alongside Mississippi and Kentucky. It is the only race of those three where Democrats are defending an incumbent governor and a top priority for the Democratic Governors Association.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/dd/29/04c5d3ea4d00b1251c440acfd01c/191012-john-bel-edwards-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
