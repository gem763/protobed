And not just with the new assault allegation. Remember, they grossly oversold how much corroboration there was for Deborah Ramirez\u2019s original claim of an assault by Kavanaugh. And they neglected to showcase the bombshell detail that Ford\u2019s friend, Leland Keyser, doesn\u2019t believe Ford\u2019s story to this day but felt threatened if she didn\u2019t say otherwise.\n\nIf you weren\u2019t feeling up to drink on a Friday night, you will soon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dismaying to see the rush to judgment,\u201d said Kate Kelly, a New York Times reporter and co-author of \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh,\u201d in an interview on the Yahoo News podcast \u201cSkullduggery.\u201d \u201cWe definitely have been grappling with it for sure,\u201d said co-author and fellow Times reporter Robin Pogrebin when asked about the firestorm the initial accounts of their book triggered. \u201cThere was a sense going into this that nuance doesn\u2019t make headlines, \u2026 that people were going to pull stuff out. \u2026 People saw what they wanted to see before learning any of the facts, or didn\u2019t even make much of an effort to pay attention to the facts.\u201d\n\nOmit the key facts, then scold readers for not paying attention to them. It\u2019s like a \u201cWhere\u2019s Waldo?\u201d book where the authors forgot to include Waldo.\n\nHere\u2019s something else about Kavanaugh that might have helped restrain the \u201crush to judgment\u201d if it had been given a more prominent place in the Times piece:\n\nThe authors also noted that they had found no evidence of Kavanaugh mistreating women as an adult \u2014 to the contrary, he had heavily promoted and mentored them \u2014 and that the image of him in some circles as a hard-right conservative was off. \u201cThis is a jurist who is known for his thoughtfulness, who\u2019s known for pragmatism, and less kind of predictably ideological,\u201d said Kelly.\n\nIn other words, basically the exact opposite of the type of guy you would think he was from the new \u2014 unsupported \u2014 sexual assault allegation.\n\nMaybe there\u2019ll be a little justice, though. Not now, not soon, but next fall in the form of a backlash to the smear campaign at the polls. Harry Enten argues that Kavanaugh politics are bad politics for Democrats:\n\nIndeed, the 2018 exit polls suggest that Kavanaugh was a net negative for Democrats across the Senate landscape. One question on some state exit polls asked voters whether a senator\u2019s Kavanaugh nomination vote was important to them. In every state but one (Florida) where the Republican senator voted for Kavanaugh or the Democratic senator voted against him, it was a net negative for the Democratic Senate nominee. In these seven states (all but one carried by Trump in 2016), those who said a senator\u2019s Kavanaugh vote was important to their choice for Senate were far more likely to vote Republican for Senate. In these states, the Republican Senate candidates won by an average of 18 points among those who said a senator\u2019s Kavanaugh vote was important to them. Among those who said the Kavanaugh vote wasn\u2019t important, the Democratic Senate candidate won by an average of 7 points.\n\nDemocrats are going to need to win at least a couple of seats in red states next year in order to take back a Senate majority. Did the \u201crush to judgment\u201d this past week make that easier for them or harder?\n\nEven so, they\u2019ll never stop targeting him, writes Peggy Noonan. Exit quotation: \u201c[P]rogressives have to prove they were right to advance the sexual-assault accusations of Christine Blasey Ford. They lost that battle; Justice Kavanaugh sits on the court. They won\u2019t stop the assault until they can prove they were right to launch it.\u201d", "description": "What.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/b-16.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
