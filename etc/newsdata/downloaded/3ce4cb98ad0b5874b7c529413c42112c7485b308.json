An investor simply focusing on yield, and not on a company's ability to generate free cash flow to pay and grow its dividend may end up owning a disproportionate percentage of these companies.\"\n\nDiversified list\n\nShe recommends investing across a diversified list of moderate-yielding companies, with attractive cash flow characteristics and the potential to offer both dividend and capital growth over the medium- to long-term.\n\nTurning to the local bourse, Andrew McAuley, chief investment officer, private banking Australia for Credit Suisse, notes over the last year, a yield-oriented Australian equities portfolio has produced a lacklustre return.\n\n\"While the ASX 200 has risen 13 per cent for the year ended June, high-yield sectors such as telecommunications, utilities and financials have underperformed sharply. Telecoms and banks in particular have suffered from strong competition and more restrictive regulation. This has led the market to question the sustainability of dividends,\" he says.\n\nMr McAuley believes the best way for investors to achieve their return goals is through investing in a portfolio that includes a range of investments that produce yield.\n\n\"By combining bonds, equities and alternative investments such as infrastructure or hedge funds, returns are smoothed, and the investor can realise profits over time to augment yield.\"\n\nHe says while bonds may not look attractive in a rising-yield world \u2013 corporate bonds with a strong credit rating are currently producing only around 3 per cent in yield to maturity \u2013 bonds' objective is income and capital stability.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Also, not all fixed income investments are alike. Floating rate notes, higher yield debt and syndicated loans can produce good returns in a rising yield environment, and can be accessed through funds.\"\n\nAccording to Mr McAuley, adding bonds to a portfolio does not necessarily mean the sacrifice of return. \"Looking at data from 1998 on, a simple portfolio with 50 per cent in both long-duration bonds and Australian equities, that is rebalanced annually, would have achieved a return slightly above the ASX 200, but with much lower volatility.\"\n\nCrowding into stocks\n\nHe notes poor returns from yield sectors have seen Australian investors crowd into stocks with growing earnings such as those in the healthcare and small, local technology sector.\n\n\"The price to earnings multiple of the ASX 200 Industrials Ex Financials sector is almost at an all time high relative to the valuation of the broader market. Growth stocks are rare and expensive in Australia. We argue, despite the attraction of franking credits and a generally higher yield, a portfolio should include international equities where the opportunity set is much deeper, and risks can be spread further.\"\n\nHow to achieve a good yield without increasing risk in a low interest rate environment has been a conundrum for investors in recent years.\n\n\"This is the magic question and in investing there's no such thing as a free lunch. What's extremely important is that within this process investors identify and understand what any new or additional risk factors are,\" says Stuart Fechner, director, retail research relationships at Bennelong Funds Management.\n\n\"Typically, to generate an increased yield some level of additional or at least different risk is involved,\" he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, investors may gain a higher yield investing in selected Australian shares versus cash, but equities come with the additional risk of volatility.\n\n\"A higher yield may be gained via investing in direct property, but the risk here may be the illiquid nature of the asset,\" Mr Fechner says.\n\nJames Carlile, head of research at InvestSMART, observes investors do not have to add risk to generate yield, they just have to give up growth.\n\n\"If you go beyond the return expected from an asset class, say 7 per cent to 8 per cent for shares, then you'll be exposed to negative growth. So, if you're buying a stock with a yield of 10 per cent, the share price or the dividend is likely to fall. Of course it still might make a decent investment \u2013 it just depends how much it falls,\" he says.\n\nFixed interest investments have an important role to play. But exactly what that role is depends on the investor's view of the direction of rates and, when it comes to dividends, company profits.", "description": "Equity markets have been hot in recent years, but there is still plenty of opportunity to identify decent yield-generating investments.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.5882%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1360%2C$x_228%2C$y_24/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c28feecb524b3a5f8af884d6744590cafbb09742", "published_at": "2018-07-11"}
