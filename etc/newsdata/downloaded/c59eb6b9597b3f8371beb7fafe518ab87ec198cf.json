To me, it means stocks which are valued not only below fair market values when looking at assets and revenues, but also when looking at the proven progress underway in the company.\n\nSo far this year, the general stock market has been on a tear. The S&P 500 has climbed in price by 21% year-to-date.\n\nBut I can easily steer you to a collection of stocks with much more reasonable, and even ample, dividend yields. And this is a collection of stocks that are performing \u2014 but are also still values to buy right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n\n\n\n\nDividend Stocks to Buy: AllianceBernstein (AB)\n\nDividend Yield: 7.5%\n\nAllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB) is a pass-through company in the asset management business. The key thing about asset managers is knowing the value of assets under management. They don\u2019t have to be exceptional in their investing \u2014 just good enough to attract and keep assets on which they earn fees year-in and year-out.\n\nAllianceBernstein\u2019s assets under management has climbed 25.8% over the trailing four years to a current $581 billion. That has resulted in revenue gains for the same period of 30.1%. This in turn is driving higher returns for shareholders with the return on equity running at 14.9%. But the real deal is that the shares trade at a discount to revenue by some 18.7% making the shares cheap.\n\nAB stock has been a good performer with the trailing five years generating a total return of 60.4% with an average annual equivalent of 10.4%.*\n\n*All total return figures were calculated by Bloomberg Terminal, factoring in dividends reinvested on the day of distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompass Diversified (CODI)\n\nDividend Yield: 7.6%\n\nCompass Diversified (NYSE:CODI) is an investment holding company set up under the Investment Companies Act of 1940. As such it operates without paying federal corporate income taxes, meaning that CODI has more cash for dividend payments to investors.\n\nThe company buys and owns a collection of well-branded industrial and consumer goods companies. And it in turn works with management teams to further develop business values. From time to time, Compass Diversified will sell the companies when appropriate. Along the way, CODI collects cash flows from the operating companies and in turn pays an ample dividend currently yielding 7.6%.\n\nRevenues are firmly on the rise with the trailing year\u2019s sales gain at 33.2%. Margins are positive, helping to drive a return on shareholder equity of 39.3%.\n\nAnd the stock is very cheap as it is valued at a 30% discount to trailing sales \u2014 which as noted are firmly on the rise.\n\nCompass Diversified continues to deliver with shares generating a total return over the past five years of 62.1% for an average annual equivalent return of 9.9%.\n\n\n\n\n\nW.P. Carey (WPC)\n\nDividend Yield: 4.7%\n\nW.P. Carey (NYSE:WPC) is a highly successful real estate investment trust with a diverse collection of properties across segments. But these properties all have in common is the company\u2019s signature structure of triple-net sale-leasebacks. This is where W.P. Carey typically acquires a property from a significant company \u2014 or even government entity \u2014 and in turn leases it back to the seller for long-term lease. In addition, the tenant pays the taxes, insurance and general upkeep costs, hence the term \u201ctriple-net.\u201d\n\nThis structure has major benefits. To start, W.P. Carey gets established tenants for their leased properties. And with longer-term leases it sets the company up with more dependable income. With the expenses of taxes, insurance and maintenance it reduces costs and uncertainty for the company.", "description": "What does \"on the cheap\" mean in the stock market?
