Watt says he is \u2018gutted\u2019 over season-ending injury", "language": "en", "text": "Watt also appeared to confirm reports that he had torn a pectoral muscle. Sharing video of himself making a second-quarter tackle for a loss against Oakland, with a caption reading, \u201cLook out for No. 99,\u201d Watt tweeted, \u201cShoulda told my pec to look out lol.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHelp us wish him a quick recovery,\u201d the Texans told their fans via their Twitter account.\n\nShoulda told my pec to look out lol https://t.co/LQDVoSheEr \u2014 JJ Watt (@JJWatt) October 28, 2019\n\nWatt, 30, is set to have a season cut short by injury for the third time in four years.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2016, he had surgery for a herniated disc over the summer, and then played just three games before requiring another procedure on his back. Watt was limited to just five games the following year after suffering a broken leg.\n\nAble to play all 16 games in 2018, the veteran defensive end reasserted himself as a dominant force. Watt finished with 16 sacks, a league-leading seven forced fumbles and earned first-team all-pro recognition for the fifth time in eight seasons to that point.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson said Sunday of Watt\u2019s injury (via ESPN). \u201cThat\u2019s a big part of this team.\n\n\u201cBut he knows that this locker room, this organization, this town, this city, the Houston nation is definitely going to support him through his recovery. We always love him. He\u2019s going to be right there with us.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHOLD YOUR HEAD UP HIGH AND STAY THE COURSE, IT\u2019ll ALL BE WORH IT IN THE END.... Myself and H-Town will be wishing you a speedy recovery bro. https://t.co/VZLAuaUP79 \u2014 James Harden (@JHarden13) October 28, 2019\n\nAfter tackling Raiders running back Josh Jacobs for a six-yard loss in the second quarter, Watt left the field and entered the medical tent on the Texans\u2019 sideline. He then jogged to the locker room and was subsequently ruled out for the rest of what would become a 27-24 Houston win.\n\nThe victory improved the Texans\u2019 record to 5-3, but the loss of Watt could prove costly to a team that traded away another star defensive end, Jadeveon Clowney, shortly before the season began. With four sacks going into the game, Watt was second on the team to linebacker Whitney Mercilus (5.5), and Watt was well ahead of any of his teammates with 20 quarterback hits (per Pro Football Reference).\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen we have situations where it might seem like we\u2019re down and people are counting us out,\u201d said Mercilus (via ESPN), \u201call we do is put our heads down and keep trucking down and make plays.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI truly love this game and can\u2019t stand letting you guys down,\u201d Watt said on Twitter. \u201cThank you for all of the thoughts & well-wishes.\u201d\n\nEven on a tough day there is reason to smile.\n\n\n\nTexans win, the Stros are winning and my nephew stood on his own for the first time.\n\n\n\nThat smile at the end can brighten up even the darkest day. pic.twitter.com/Ccu6qZejFH \u2014 JJ Watt (@JJWatt) October 28, 2019\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The three-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year was hurt during the Houston Texans' win over the Oakland Raiders on Sunday.", "authors": ["Des Bieler", "Sports Reporter Covering National Topics", "Including Fantasy Football", "As Well As Supporting Coverage Of D.C.-Area Teams"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/IW2bAlJylxvqvldPkzzlnIHy7YM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XY5ODCRLGRHKTGOTCHDMLAQXFI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
