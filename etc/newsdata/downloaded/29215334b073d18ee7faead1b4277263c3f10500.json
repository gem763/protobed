Brown-Long allegedly shot Allen because she thought he was reaching for a gun while in a bedroom in his home.\n\nCyntoia Brown-Long (pictured above) said she worried the attention brought to her story from celebrities like Kim Kardashian had her worried that it would rub then Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam the wrong way as he decided on whether to commute her sentence\n\nBrown-Long's story was the basis for the 2011 documentary, 'Me Facing Life: Cyntoia's Story' that caught the eye of activist groups and celebrities like Kim Kardashian West, LeBron James, Meek Mill and Rihanna, who helped bring national attention to her case\n\nBut she still lost her case and got a life sentence. Her story would end up featured in a 2011 documentary, 'Me Facing Life: Cyntoia's Story,' about her life behind bars,' drawing the attention of Kardashian and other celebrities.\n\nBrown-Long admitted that support was not exactly in her best interest, especially when Halsam was considering her clemency.\n\n'I was so nervous and the I was like, I don't want the governor to think I've done this to like try to kind of like push his hand,' she tells NBC Nightly News. 'Like that could backfire. That could look very bad.'\n\n'We had actually heard back from the governor's counsel that the whole Kim Kardashian thing was not helping. So I was kind of fearful,' she added.\n\nProsecutors argued that Brown-Long was not defending herself, but was attempting to rob Allen. She was tried as an adult, convicted of first-degree murder, which would have kept her in prison for life. She would be 69-years-old by the time she would be eligible for parole.\n\nFormer Tennessee Governor BIll Haslam granted Brown-Long clemency, saying that 'imposing a life sentence on a juvenile that would require her to serve at least 51 years before even being eligible for parole consideration is too harsh'\n\nHaslam granted her clemency, saying that 'imposing a life sentence on a juvenile that would require her to serve at least 51 years before even being eligible for parole consideration is too harsh, especially in light of the extraordinary steps Ms. Brown has taken to rebuild her life.'\n\nShe will remain on parole for 10 years, but is thankful.\n\nAfter the documentary story of her life was released, Kardashian West, LeBron James, Meek Mill and Rihanna, helped bring national attention to her case.\n\nFeeling nervous about such attention, Brown-Long said she turned to her faith for strength.\n\n'I had to just like trust that God had a plan,' she says.\n\nBrown-Long told NBC Nightly News that despite the hardships she's endured, she feels like she's been given a 'great opportunity.'\n\n'It's an honor that God has put me in this position. I feel like it's a great opportunity,' she said.\n\n'I fully intend to step into that and to share my experiences as often as I can, with whoever I can, in the hopes that it can bring about more understanding about what goes on in the system with young girls who find themselves in the situation that I did.'\n\nBrown-Long spent 15 years in prison after she was convicted of first-degree murder for the shooting death of Johnny Allen (pictured above), a 43-year-old real estate agent, in 2004\n\n'There's nothing special about me. There's, I can't tell you how many Cyntoia Browns still in prison,' she said. 'The women who helped me get to this point, they're still in prison for 51 years and up with ridiculous sentences. And they don't have hope right now.'\n\nBrown-Long had claimed that Allen allegedly picked her up for sex, according to court documents. He first stopped for food, and then drove her to his home.\n\nWhile there, Allen said she thought Allen reached for a gun and responded by shooting him her own handgun. She claimed self-defense.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Cyntoia Brown-Long tells @LesterHoltNBC she was worried the celebrity attention to her case could \"backfire.\"\n\n\n\nShe was granted clemency after serving 15 years of a life sentence for killing a man when she was 16: https://t.co/5VJmdaSTv6\n\n\n\nSee more on @NBCNightlyNews. pic.twitter.com/7tiKzQ9QSg \u2014 NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt (@NBCNightlyNews) October 14, 2019\n\nShe earned college degrees while at the Tennessee Prison for Women, and soon gained support for her release.\n\nShe will remain on parole for 10 years, but is thankful.\n\nBrown-Long said: 'One of the best moments was the night I celebrated my release with my whole family and everyone who'd made a difference in my life over the last 15 years', according to NBC News.\n\n'Looking around and seeing how everything had come together, and how everyone was fellow-shipping and happy, was just incredible,' she said.\n\n'I wasn't presenting myself as a 16-year-old heading to prison and needing help.
