A disgruntled Australian woman by the name of Shannon B launched an impassioned Change.org petition on Sunday, condemning the outfit and labelling it \u201cbeyond inappropriate and offensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cA child bride costume currently exists on Kmart shelves in children\u2019s sizes,\u201d reads the petition. \u201cTell Kmart this is beyond inappropriate and offensive and that they have a social responsibility to pull this item off their shelves immediately.\u201d\n\nThe screed went on to argue that 12 million children are globally being sold or married off by their families without consent every year, and that many of them are \u201cgirls as young as 6 years old\u2014the same size as this \u2018costume\u2019.\u201d By way of some questionable maths, Shannon then points out that this \u201cequates to 23 children every minute or one child every two minutes\u201d\u2014but stops short of clarifying how Kmart\u2019s costume contributes to the problem.\n\nThe petition racked up a total of 179 signatures by Tuesday afternoon, whereupon Kmart decided to take it off the shelf. A spokesperson told 7 News that \"Kmart Australia regrets the decision to range the bride costume. It was not intended to cause offence and we sincerely apologise. We have made the decision to withdraw this product.\"\n\nAccording to global NGO Girls Not Brides, \u201cchild brides can be found in every region in the world, from the Middle East to Latin America, South Asia to Europe.\u201d\n\nTheir website further states that \u201cchild marriage is a complex issue. Poverty, lack of education, cultural practices, and insecurity fuel and sustain the practice\u201d, and notes that \u201cmore than half of girls from the poorest families in the developing world are married as children.\u201d\n\nIn the time since the outfit was pulled from shelves, Shannon B has uploaded another post to her Change petition thanking those who supported her.\n\n\"The victory of this petition has since attracted international attention\u2014which is awesome!\" she said. \"In response, UNICEF and World Vision have had opportunities to make media statements and therefore raise awareness around the issue of child brides and the reality they face in fighting this fight around the world, including westernised countries like USA and Australia.\"\n\nFollow Gavin on Twitter or Instagram", "description": "A disgruntled Australian woman called the costume \"beyond inappropriate\" and launched a petition that forced the retailer to take the costume off the shelves.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db1315a97a67c008de19ed5/lede/1571895315841-pjimage-2019-10-24T163459232.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
