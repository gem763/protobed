The president has said he wanted European countries to pay more for their own defense, and denied delaying any military aid funding.\n\nSOURCE SAYS WHISTLEBLOWER DIDN'T HAVE 'FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE' OF TRUMP CALL WITH UKRAINE PRESIDENT\n\nLast week, a whistleblower complaint surfaced containing allegations Trump made a troubling and unspecified \"promise\" to a foreign leader later reported to be Zelensky -- touching off a Washington firestorm. On Monday, a person familiar with the situation told Fox News the whistleblower did not have \u201cfirsthand knowledge\u201d of the conversation.\n\nThe whistleblower's allegation could, however, prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. The former vice president has explained on camera that in March 2016, he privately threatened then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor wasn't fired.\n\nTo that extent, Pence told Hannity all Americans should know the full account of both Bidens' relations with Kiev.\n\n\"The American people have a right to know what happened. They have a right to know what happened in 2016 and they have a right to know what the circumstances were around having a sitting vice president threaten to withhold American aid.\"\n\nBIDEN'S CAMPAIGN LIKELY COMING TO AN END -- THANKS TO CLINTON-LINKED UKRAINE BOMBSHELL, NUNES SAYS\n\n\"I said, \u2018You\u2019re not getting the billion,'\" Biden recounted telling Poroshenko at a Council on Foreign Relations event. \"I\u2019m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.'\"\n\n\"Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,\" Biden continued, after assuring Poroshenko that Obama knew about the arrangement. \"And, they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\"\n\nIt remained unclear if this was directly tied to the prosecutor's probe into the company linked to Hunter Biden, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPence's comments to Hannity echoed remarks made by Trump during United Nations meetings in New York City.\n\n\"Joe Biden and his son are corrupt, but the fake news doesn\u2019t want to report because they\u2019re Democrats,\" Trump said Monday. \"If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they\u2019d be getting the electric chair.\"\n\nTrump added: \"Look at the double standards, you people ought to be ashamed of yourselves\u2026You got a lot of crooked journalists, you\u2019re crooked as hell.\"\n\nFox News' Andrew O'Reilly, Jake Gibson and Alex Pappas contributed to this report.", "description": "Vice President Mike Pence lit into the mainstream media over its coverage of the Ukraine controversy\u00a0in an interview airing Monday on \"Hannity.\"", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Pence-Hannity.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
