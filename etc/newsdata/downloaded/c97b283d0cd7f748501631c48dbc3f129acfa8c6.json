It was the largest acquisition for Blackberry to date.\n\nAt the time, Blackberry said it would expand Cylance's capabilities across BlackBerry's portfolio, including QNX, its safety-certified embedded OS that is deployed in more than 120 million vehicles and medical devices. Blackberry said that, over time, it plans to integrate Cylance technology with its BlackBerry Spark communications platform.\n\nNot long after the acquisition, Blackberry launched a security credential management service designed for smart cities and transportation services so autonomous vehicles could securely communicate with infrastructure, such as traffic lights and roads.\n\nDuring its first quarter financial results in June, Blackberry reported a net loss of $35 million. It was the first quarterly report since the company reorganised into three business units: IoT, Blackberry Cylance, and Licensing.\n\nAt the time, Chen noted the company's integration with Cylance was ahead of schedule, with back-office, personnel, sales and R&D teams almost completely merged.\n\n\"We expect [the Cylance integration] to be done within this fiscal year,\" Chen said.\n\n\"It will be done meaning to be released as a product, so that's reasonably record time. The next team that has launched is to look into putting Cylance AI technology on to the automotive platform, on the QNX. That's going on very well, too. So I think, on the technological side, it's very, very positive.\"\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nBlackBerry Q1 beats estimates as Cylance business rings up $51 million in revenue\n\nThis is the first quarterly report since BlackBerry reorganized into three business units: IoT, BlackBerry Cylance, and Licensing.\n\nBlackBerry Q4 tops estimates on strong IP and licensing revenue\n\nCEO John Chen noted on the company's earnings conference call that BlackBerry will reorganize into three business units for fiscal 2020.\n\nBlackBerry taps former Cisco exec Bryan Palma for COO role\n\nPalma is set to play a key role in integrating Cylance into BlackBerry's products.\n\nCES 2019: BlackBerry Secure feature packs aspire to give trusted security to 'all smart things'\n\nBlackBerry announced three secure feature packs that will provide companies with trusted software and a proven certification framework to build secure smart products.\n\nWhy BlackBerry should change its name\n\nBlackBerry is all about enterprise software, services, security, and the Internet of Things these days.
