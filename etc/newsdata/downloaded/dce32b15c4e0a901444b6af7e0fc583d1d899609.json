The CW also announced that the show\u2019s third season would debut a bit earlier than expected, on October 7th.\n\nThe crossover event will be loosely based on the 1985 crossover comic series, which rebooted the entire franchise at the time. The network also revealed that Kevin Conroy, who\u2019s best known for voicing Batman in Batman: The Animated Series, will play an older version of Bruce Wayne in the event. Last month, it said that Brandon Routh, who played Superman in the 2006 film Superman Returns, would reprise the role for the upcoming Crisis on Infinite Earths event.\n\nInitially, Black Lightning wasn\u2019t considered part of the larger Arrowverse franchise. CW chief Mark Pedowitz noted when the show began that there was a practical reason for that: location. Black Lightning filmed in Atlanta, Georgia, while the rest of the franchise\u2019s shows were produced in Vancouver, Canada. Traveling between the two cities was just too logistically difficult, it seems.\n\nBut given the scale of this latest crossover event, it seems that the CW has opted to make the effort to bring the characters into the story somehow. This isn\u2019t the first time that the Arrowverse has brought in shows that were technically out of continuity, thanks in part to its embrace of a multiverse that encompassed other DC properties: the CW brought over Supergirl from CBS, and Legends of Tomorrow brought in Matt Ryan\u2019s depiction of Constantine, after NBC canceled that character\u2019s show. The show has also shared some continuity with the 1990 film The Flash. Presumably, the rest of DC\u2019s film and television adaptations could be retroactively pulled in someday.", "description": "The CW\u2019s Arrowverse franchise is getting some new members: characters from its superhero series Black Lightning will be part of a major crossover event Crisis on Infinite Earths, which will see its other DC superhero shows Arrow, Batwoman, The Flash, DC\u2019s Legends of Tomorrow, and Supergirl team up this fall.", "authors": ["Andrew Liptak", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O7ROwqgM8wAC01ayheLBNhw2z2E=/0x0:1280x670/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8540945/blacklightning_1280_1490821966105_1280w.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-04"}
