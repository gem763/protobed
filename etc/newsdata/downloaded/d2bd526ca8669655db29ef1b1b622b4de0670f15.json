The naval part of the exercise covered the Barents, Baltic, Black, Caspian and Okhotsk seas.\n\nThe K-44 Ryazan was first brought into service during the 1980s, but has undergone modernisation since then.\n\nThe launch of the R-29R missiles during the training exercise was necessary to keep them operational, a person close to the Navy's general staff told Vedomosti, saying that they were nearing the end of their service life.
