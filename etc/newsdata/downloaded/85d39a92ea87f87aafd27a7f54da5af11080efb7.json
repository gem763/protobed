China reciprocated with new duties on U.S. crude oil, increasing fears of a global economic slowdown.\n\nAn ongoing decline in the euro zone's export-reliant powerhouse of Germany meant factory activity in the bloc contracted for a seventh month in August, bolstering expectations the European Central Bank will ease monetary policy next week.\n\nIHS Markit's August final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was 47.0, matching an earlier flash reading but well below the 50 level separating growth from contraction.\n\nWhile an improvement on July, that month's reading was the euro zone's lowest since December 2012.\n\nIn one brighter spot, as it is less dependent on exports than other euro zone countries, France's economy has so far proved more impervious to a slowdown and factory activity returned to growth as manufacturers saw output and client demand pick up.\n\nManufacturing in Britain, rocked by the deepening Brexit crisis and global downturn, contracted last month at the fastest rate in seven years.\n\n\"The big picture is that manufacturing is on track to contract for a second consecutive quarter, and a meaningful recovery is unlikely given the ongoing struggles of global manufacturing,\" said Andrew Wishart, an economist at Capital Economics.\n\n\"And while the euro zone equivalent ticked up, it points to manufacturing output from the bloc continuing to contract.\"\n\nA similar survey due later from the United States is expected to show slowing manufacturing growth in the world's largest economy.
