USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies dismissed manager Gabe Kalper on Wednesday, ending the first-time skipper's run in Philadelphia after two seasons.\n\nThe decision was made by Phillies owner John Middleton, and not general manager Matt Klentak, a high-ranking Phillies executive told USA TODAY Sports on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe beginning of Kapler's tenure appeared promising, as the Phillies embarked on a strong first half in 2018. But they sputtered toward the finish line and dropped out of playoff contention.\n\nKapler was charged with leading a significant payroll, buoyed by the acquisition of Bryce Harper during the offseason, to the postseason in 2019. Philadelphia's lack of consistency and pitching woes led to a 81-81 finish this year and the club missed the playoffs once again. Overall, the Phillies went 161-163 under Kapler.\n\nThe Phillies are the second NL East team to move on from their manager hired after the 2017 season. The New York Mets moved on from Mickey Callaway last week.\n\nBoth teams join a host of clubs seeking a new manager. Joe Maddon has been closely linked to the Los Angeles Angels opening and the Chicago Cubs interviewed former New York Yankees manager Joe Girardi on Wednesday. The San Diego Padres, Kansas City Royals, Pittsburgh Pirates and San Francisco Giants are also in the market for a new skipper.", "description": "The Philadelphia Phillies fired manager Gabe Kapler on Thursday.
