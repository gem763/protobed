They\u2019re flashy and bold but accessible and allow anyone with a store nearby to access high-end design at affordable prices. They push the envelope and ask consumers to suspend what they know about designer fashion. So Target decided to launch a handful of pieces back into the marketplace to celebrate 20 years of collaborations. A lot is already sold out, but here are the top five to pick up right now.\n\nIsaac Mizrahi for Target Floral Print Sleeveless Square Neck Pleated Dress, $50: The square neckline is a little bit \u201850s but the bold colors are all 2019. This dress is feminine and floral. Plus, it\u2019s got pockets.\n\nThakoon for Target Shibori Print Elbow Sleeve Button-Front Mini Shirtdress, $38: Designed to mimic traditional Shibori prints, this mixed media dress is what you\u2019ll want to wear to cocktails at the end of summer.\n\nHunter for Target Large Tote Bag, $35: The Hunter collaboration offered up an expansion of what Hunter is known for, and this tote bag is an example. It\u2019s oversized with bright orange lining and features interior and exterior pockets for extra organization.\n\n3.1 Phillip Lim for Target Men\u2019s Long Sleeve Front Button-Down Trench Coat, $70: There\u2019s nothing like a classic trench and this one is as classic as it gets. It\u2019s dark charcoal instead of the standard camel to give a more polished look.\n\nMissoni for Target 29.5\" Four-Wheel Rolling Suitcase, $160: Always know where your bag is with a bold Missoni print. The classic chevron/zig-zag pattern that Missoni is famous for is emblazoned on the perfect travel companion.\n\nExplore more of the 20 Years of Design for All at Target. | Shop at Target >\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
