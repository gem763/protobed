But early startups relying on limited funds can't shell out for a fleet of private commuter buses or daily catered meals. Enter Zestful.\n\nZestful lets small companies like startups pay a monthly fee to offer employees a variety of perks and benefits, like monthly subscriptions to Netflix or the email service Superhuman. On Tuesday, the 3-year-old startup announced it raised $5 million in seed funding led by Thrive Capital, with participation from Box Group, Y Combinator, Matchstick Ventures, Third Kind Capital, and Shrug Capital.\n\n\"A Series A says you figured it out, and you're doubling down on the growth phase, and to me, that means we are doubling down on trying to be everywhere,\" Zestful founder and CEO Mat Vogels told Business Insider. \"But sticking with seed funding means we want to focus on the product and build it before we go with a Series A.\"\n\nRead more: A Harvard grad was the first employee at buzzy credit card startup Brex and says the experience was better than any MBA program she could have taken.\n\nNew workforce, new rules\n\nVogels said he had seen the competition firsthand when he was working in San Francisco's Bay Area, as startups struggled to attract and retain talent. He said that those first hires are the most important to the company's success, but it's easier than ever for talented employees to take higher paying or more flexible roles at other companies if the startup can't keep up.\n\n\"We may not have all the bells and whistles and features, but what we've built is for the employees, and we have the numbers to back it up,\" Vogels said. \"That's what the head of HR or People Ops care about most. They want people to be happy with it.\"\n\nAs the workforce gets younger, Vogels says that employees will demand personalized benefits like those in Zestful more and more. Gen Zers and young Millennials see work as an extension of their personal lives instead of being a completely separate endeavor, studies have shown, and they want an employer that recognizes that, Vogels said.\n\n\"Millennials don't need a high salary, but the company needs to invest in things they care about,\" Vogels said. \"Employees are not one size fits all, so the benefits shouldn't be either. They just want to feel good and appreciated by the company.\"\n\n$5 million can pack more of a punch outside Silicon Valley\n\nAfter being initially rejected by Y Combinator's accelerator program, Vogels took Zestful out of the overly competitive San Francisco ecosystem to Denver, where he's built the company over the past three years. Zestful's funding round, which is large for a seed stage, even by Silicon Valley standards, is one of the largest in Colorado history.\n\n\"Investors are trying to get out of the coasts and outside of expensive cities,\" Vogels said. \"The $5 million will last us five or 10 times longer than if we were in San Francisco, or New York, or Chicago, and they appreciate that idea because they get more bang for their buck.\"", "description": "The startup has raised $6.1 million in venture funding since January, founder and CEO Mat Vogels told Business Insider.", "authors": ["Megan Hernbroth"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7690a32e22af5ced075bac-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
