It is unclear when it may be available.\n\nA new blood test could pick up on more than 20 types of cancer, research suggests (stock)\n\nThe test looks for abnormal methylation, a process which occurs when so-called methyl groups are added to a DNA molecule.\n\nMethylation controls whether a gene is 'on' or 'off', with certain variations being associated with cancer.\n\nMethylated DNA gets shed by cancer cells into the bloodstream when a tumour dies.\n\nExisting 'liquid biopsies' detect genetic mutations or other cancer-related changes to DNA.\n\n'Our work indicated methylation-based assays outperform traditional DNA-sequencing approaches to detecting multiple forms of cancer in blood samples,' lead author Dr Geoffrey Oxnard said.\n\n'The results of the new study demonstrate such assays are a feasible way of screening people for cancer.'\n\nThe scientists analysed 3,583 blood samples. Of which, 1,530 had been drawn from cancer patients and 2,053 from people without the disease.\n\nThe patients' samples were made up of more than 20 forms of the disease, including pancreatic, ovarian, colorectal and breast.\n\nWHAT ARE THE FOUR STAGES OF CANCER? Stage one: Cancer is relatively small and contained in the organ it started in Stage two: Tumour is larger than stage one but has not spread to surrounding tissue. In some cases, cancer cells may have spread to nearby lymph nodes Stage three: Cancer is larger and has started to spread to surrounding tissue. Malignant cells are in the lymph nodes of that area of the body Stage four: Cancer has spread, causing secondary form of the disease Source: Cancer Research UK\n\nOverall, the test, which has yet to be named, picked up a 'cancer signal' 99.4 per cent of the time.\n\nThe scientists then looked into whether the test could narrow down where the cancer started, getting it right 89 per cent of the time.\n\nWhen analysing 'high mortality cancers', it detected the disease in 76 per cent of cases overall.\n\nWithin this group, the sensitivity for stage one cancer was 32 per cent, stage two 76 per cent, stage three 85 per cent and stage four 93 per cent.\n\n'Detecting even a modest per cent of common cancers early could translate into many patients who may be able to receive more effective treatment if the test were in wide use,' Dr Oxnard told The Telegraph.\n\nFull results will be presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2019 Congress in Barcelona.\n\nHealth ministers have pledged for three quarters of cancer patients to be diagnosed at stage one or two by 2028.\n\nBritain ranks bottom of international league tables for cancer survival, two decades behind some countries.\n\nThis week an independent review of NHS cancer screening is set to warn 'confusion and delays' is costing lives.\n\nThe review reportedly calls for Public Health England to be stripped of its role in overseeing diagnoses.\n\nWhen diagnosed early, cancer tumours are smaller and have not spread. Once the disease has metastasised, treatment becomes more difficult.\n\nWhen it comes to bowel cancer, nine of 10 patients will survive more than five years if diagnosed at the earliest stage, Cancer Research UK statistics show.\n\nAnd more than 90 per cent of women diagnosed with breast cancer at the earliest stage live for at least five years compared to around 15 per cent diagnosed at the most advanced stage.", "description": "Harvard scientists created a test that looks for genetic changes associated with cancer's development.
