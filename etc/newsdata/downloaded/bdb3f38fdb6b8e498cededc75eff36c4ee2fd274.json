Pyongyang characteristically took a maximalist approach, both in its rhetoric and its demands. Having commanded the United States to adopt a totally \u201cnew method of calculation,\u201d the regime disparaged Washington\u2019s new proposals.\n\nNorth Korean negotiator Kim Myong-gil declared that denuclearization is possible only after the cessation of all U.S.\u2013South Korean joint military exercises while North Korean Ambassador to the United Nations Kim Song demanded an end to all sanctions.\n\nThe Trump administration provided a more optimistic spin on the meeting, rebuffing North Korea\u2019s assertion that it had not provided a new proposal. The State Department commented that the United States \u201cbrought creative ideas [and] a number of new initiatives.\u201d\n\nPyongyang dismissed U.S. eagerness to resume talks quickly, declaring it had \u201cno intention to hold such \u2018sickening negotiations\u2019\u201d before the United States takes substantial steps to end its \u201chostile policy.\u201d The diplomatic talks augering into the ground so dramatically does not augur well for future progress.\n\nNuclear negotiator Kim cautioned that without significant U.S. policy changes the bilateral engagement \u201cmay immediately come to an end for good.\u201d He ominously warned that the regime was reconsidering its moratorium on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests. In April, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un declared his patience will only last until the end of the year when the situation becomes \u201cgloomy and very dangerous.\u201d\n\nSome dismiss North Korea\u2019s acerbic comments as diplomatic maneuvering and indeed, the regime often engages in brinkmanship to wrest additional concessions from opponents. But underlying the tactical maneuvering are enduring North Korean strategic objectives to maintain its nuclear arsenal.\n\nPresident Trump declared that \u201cthe best thing that\u2019s happened to this country\u201d during his administration was his \u201cvery good relationship with Kim Jong-un.\u201d But this relationship has not produced any progress on denuclearization. The two sides have yet to even agree on a definitions of \u201cdenuclearization\u201d or the \u201cKorean Peninsula.\u201d North Korea continues to expand and refine its nuclear and missile arsenal.\n\nSome argue, incorrectly, that there has been no cost to President Trump\u2019s approach. However, that neglects the large U.S. sanctions relief, cancellation of numerous military exercises and embrace of a purveyor of crimes against humanity, which undercut all components of the maximum pressure policy.\n\nThe United States also accepted 21 North Korean violations of U.N. resolutions this year without any response or repercussions to the regime. Mr. Trump has now adopted a weaker version of the Obama administration\u2019s strategic patience policy and timid incrementalism of sanctions enforcement.\n\nDespite the setback in the February 2019 Hanoi summit, Kim Jong-un may feel he has the upper hand in negotiations. Pyongyang publicly referenced the 2020 presidential election and may hold threats of resuming nuclear and ICBM tests as a Damocles sword over President Trump\u2019s head to induce additional concessions. The regime may perceive the dismissal of National Security Adviser John Bolton as portending a softening of U.S. policy. Mr. Bolton\u2019s departure removed the biggest constraint to an incomplete deal that prematurely reduces pressure prior to real denuclearization.\n\nThough there is little reason for optimism, the United States should continue diplomatic attempts to reduce the North Korean nuclear threat. But the Trump administration should not become overeager to accept a weak, flawed agreement. Instead it should insist on a detailed, comprehensive road map to North Korea abandoning its nuclear and missile production capabilities and existing arsenals. The accord should include a robust verification protocol, including data declarations of North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs.\n\nThe United States should reciprocate North Korea\u2019s end of year deadline with one of its own. Washington should announce it will resume canceled military exercises with South Korea and no longer pull its punches on enforcing U.S. laws if Pyongyang continues to drag its feet on complying with U.N. denuclearization requirements. America\u2019s self-imposed concessions did not lead to diplomatic progress nor reduce the North Korean military threat.\n\nNorth Korea is likely to remain a threat that requires a bipartisan policy of deterrence, containment and compellence. The best policy for the United States is a comprehensive strategy of diplomacy, upholding U.N. resolutions and U.S. laws, and deterrence until the nuclear, missile and conventional force threat is reduced.\n\n\u2022 Bruce Klingner is senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at The Heritage Foundation.
