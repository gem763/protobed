REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/Files\n\nIn a statement, London-based BP said it expects to agree asset sales of $10 billion by end-year after its $5.6 billion sale of its Alaskan business to Hilcorp and divestments in U.S. shale gas.\n\nBP shares were down 1.1% by 0948 GMT compared with a 1.3% gain in the broader European energy index.\n\nThe non-cash, non-operating, after-tax charge will impact the company\u2019s headline profit figure but not its underlying cashflow, a spokesman said.\n\nBP announced the disposal programme following its $10.25 billion acquisition of BHP\u2019s shale business last year, its largest purchase in three decades.\n\nThe planned third-quarter impairment charges are expected to increase BP\u2019s gearing - the ratio between debt and market capitalisation - to the top end of the 20% to 30% target, BP said.\n\nDebt levels and gearing are expected to move to the middle of the range through 2020.\n\nBP\u2019s third-quarter oil and gas production will be impacted by maintenance in some high-margin regions, BP said.\n\nOutput in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico was \u201csignificantly disrupted\u201d by Hurricane Barry, with facilities shut down for around 14 days.\n\nBP is scheduled to report its results on October 29.", "description": "BP will take charges of $2 to $3 billion (2.40 billion pounds) in the third quarter, the British energy firm said on Friday, as it looks to reach divestments worth $10 billion by the end of 2019, a year ahead of schedule.", "authors": ["Ron Bousso", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439642923&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0SA", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
