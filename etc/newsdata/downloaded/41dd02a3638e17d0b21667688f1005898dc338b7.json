The S&P 500 gained 1.09% to close at 2,970.27. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.34% to 8,057.04. The major indexes rallied to end the week as the Trump administration struck what it called a \"substantial\" trade deal with China.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said China and the U.S. agreed to the first phase of a broader trade deal. He said the terms of that phase will be written over the next three weeks. Stocks hit their session highs on that comment, with the Dow briefly rallying more than 500 points.\n\nAs part of this first phase, China will buy between $40 billion and $50 billion worth of U.S. agricultural products.
