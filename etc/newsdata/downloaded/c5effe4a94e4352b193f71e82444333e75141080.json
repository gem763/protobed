The lost time is the equivalent of almost 1 million full-time workers.\n\nAcross all countries assessed, Britain is in the worst third for lost labour output, while costing every person an extra \u00a3409 a year, in taxes, researchers found.\n\nAnd conditions fuelled by excess weight are soaking up more than 8 per cent of health expenditure, while cutting life expectancy by 2.7 years on average.\n\nThe findings follow calls from the country\u2019s departing Chief Medical Officer to ban eating or drinking on public transport.\n\nProf Dame Sally Davies called for radical changes to tackle a \u201cmindless\u201d snack culture, including hiking taxes on unhealthy foods, or putting snacks in plain packaging, if sugar consumption does not fall.", "description": "Britain's obesity crisis is costing every taxpayer more than \u00a3400 a year - and taking an average of three lives off our lives, international research shows.", "authors": ["Laura Donnelly", "Health Editor", "Jemima Lewis", "David Green", "Matthew Lesh", "Stewart Jackson", "Vernon Bogdanor", "Michael Deacon", "Lucy Denyer", "Julian Jessop"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/10/151426816_PA_Junk-food-advertising-1-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqGQR7TMwEvfaYG0TH6J-Ry47a_VTESG9B0eGxJBsGDgA.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
