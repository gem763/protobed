Additionally, it only contains a mere 3.3g of fibre per 100g.\n\nTwo cereals which didn't make the cut on Stephanie's healthy list include Kellogg's Just Right (pictured left) and Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Cornflakes (pictured right)\n\nAVOID: Kellogg's Just Right\n\nThe problem with Kellogg's Just Right is the packaging makes it look healthy, however, nutritionally, this isn't the case.\n\n'Just Right' from Kelloggs is a perfect example of an unhealthy cereal that people regularly mistake for being good for you,' Stephanie said.\n\nShe said while the fibre content is reasonable at 10.2g per 100g, the sugar content at 23 per cent is too high.\n\nWhat do you need to know to pick a healthy cereal? High fibre: Dietary fibre helps maintain a healthy digestive system and decreases the risk of bowel cancer. Choosing a breakfast cereal with a substantial amount of fibre will set you on your way to meeting your daily fibre needs. Seven grams per serve is considered to be an excellent source of fibre, but manufacturer-recommended serving sizes can vary greatly between brands and products, making it difficult to compare like with like. For a cereal with better-than-average fibre content, look for 10g fibre per 100g or more. Wholegrains: The words 'whole' or 'wholegrain' in the first ingredient or two usually means the cereal is less processed and will contain more vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals. A diet high in wholegrains and cereal fibre can reduce the risk of premature death from chronic diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
