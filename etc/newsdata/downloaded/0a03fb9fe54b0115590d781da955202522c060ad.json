It takes work to create the right atmosphere to scare players out of their seats. Developers have to invest time in world-building, visuals and sound all in the name of creating nightmare scenarios.\n\nIn many ways, it\u2019s the exact opposite of what studios strive for. Instead of designing a soothing and comfortable experience, horror-game developers aim to elicit unease and anxiety. For players, that adrenaline-soaked fear pays off when it\u2019s combined with compelling gameplay and produces indelible moments.\n\nThe memories of horror games are often more vivid than for an action-driven shooter. That emotional rush stays with players.\n\nThis Halloween season, three titles are trying to produce the same feelings. Each one has a different way of doing it, but all of them rely on a strong atmosphere to stir dread into players.\n\nThe Dark Pictures Anthology: Man of Medan\n\nVideo of The Dark Pictures Anthology: Man of Medan \u2013 Launch Trailer PS4\n\nThe first on the list is The Dark Pictures Anthology: Man of Medan. Produced by veteran studio Supermassive Games, it carries over many of the gameplay elements of the team\u2019s surprise hit Until Dawn. Both games follow a group of young people who encounter a ghastly set of circumstances.\n\nMan of Medan is essentially a video game version of a slasher flick except it gives players the agency to control the characters. Ever watch a movie and yell at the main character to stay away from the closet? Well in Man of Medan, players can make it happen.\n\n4 new teen horror books sure to make you squirm, just in time for Halloween\n\nPlayers will control five characters who have been kidnapped by fishermen in the Pacific Ocean. That\u2019s when the group runs into a ghost ship and board it looking for shelter and treasure. The only problem is that horrors lie within, and players have to navigate the scenario.\n\nSuccess depends on minigames that emerge as players explore the ship. Sometimes they\u2019ll have quicktime events as they\u2019re chased by maniacs. Other times they\u2019ll have to control their heartbeat via a rhythm-based minigame.\n\nThe one flaw is that the secret behind the Ourang Medan ghost ship is fairly predictable, and once they figure it out, players can keep the cast alive as they endure the frightening adventure.\n\nErica\n\nVideo of Erica Launch Trailer PS4\n\nErica from Flavourworks offers players a way to control the outcome of a story, but the developer takes away the granular control. Instead of moving characters around and exploring a beautifully crafted vessel, this interactive thriller acts more like a Choose Your Own Adventure novel that features full-motion video.\n\nPlayers follow Erica Mason, a woman with a tragic past. Her mother died when she was young and her father was murdered. One day, she receives a package with severed hand and that causes her to take shelter at the Delphi House, a mental institution that her father helped establish. The staff there care for her, but something isn\u2019t right.\n\nUntitled Goose Game review: Like Metal Gear Solid ... but with a goose\n\nThe game can played using a Dualshock 4 but it\u2019s best experienced with an iOS or Android device. Erica uses Sony\u2019s Playlink technology to make a phone or tablet a controller. That\u2019s how players will choose what actions the protagonists takes. Players can choose dialogue options or perform more action-oriented manoeuvres such as lighting a lantern.\n\nErica has a surprisingly engaging narrative and the choices the developers give gamers can be agonising. All of it depends on how players interpret the facts given to them and decide whom to believe as they dig deeper into the mysteries of Delphi House. The game is reminiscent of Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, but with better gameplay elements.\n\nThis game has a Mature ESRB rating.\n\nBlair Witch\n\nVideo of Blair Witch - Launch Trailer\n\nBloober Games isn\u2019t a well-known studio, but its latest project, Blair Witch, will draw attention to it. The first-person horror game takes place two years after the events in the 1999 cult film. Players take on the role of Ellis Lynch, a former police officer with mental health issues as he joins the search for a boy named Peter Shannon, who went missing in the woods.\n\nWith a dog named Bullet at his side, players will venture into the forest and immerse themselves in the creepy atmosphere. Compared to Man of Medan and Erica, Blair Witch moves at a slower pace. Players use the dog to sniff out for clues for the boy, and they will rely on a walkie-talkie and cellphone to contact the outside world. Because it\u2019s set in the past, players should expect the inconveniences of the 1990s, such as bad cell reception and the lack of GPS.\n\nBest Halloween movies to rewatch for your next scary night in, from Ghostbusters to Get Out\n\nThe lack of modern-day conveniences raises the fear in the game as players explore the dark woods with limited resources. Visually, the game is striking and that realism will make players buy into the experience. The drawback for Blair Witch is the puzzles and its impact on exploration. Both can be obtuse, leaving players frustrated with the game\u2019s lack of direction. It\u2019s a delicate balancing act that Bloober doesn\u2019t always get right.\n\nStill, the game has its moments, but it\u2019s more likely to be embraced and enjoyed by fans of the movie.", "description": "This spooky season, here are three horror games for PS4, Xbox and Windows, guaranteed to send chills down your spine.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/664ad9be-f62a-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6imagehires151708.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
