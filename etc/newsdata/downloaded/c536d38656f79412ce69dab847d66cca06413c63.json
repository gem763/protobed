NSW Genius Arrested At Real Gunpoint After Swanning Around Town With A Fake One", "language": "en", "text": "A 19-year-old man has been arrested at gunpoint in Ulladulla after being caught allegedly carrying a toy gun that looks like an assault rifle. It\u2019s never a good idea to carry an imitation gun in public, especially at night.\n\nThe man was swarmed by police at gunpoint at 12.10am on Wednesday August 14 while walking down Golden Valley Drive in Ulladulla, according to About Regional.\n\nThe gun, which shoots gel balls, looks close enough to a real gun that you\u2019d probably be dialling 000 if you saw it. So obviously police weren\u2019t taking any risks when they held the man at gunpoint.\n\n\u201cThe officers drew their firearms and directed the man to drop the weapon,\u201d the police report read.\u201cThe firearm was placed on the ground and secured by police. It was seized along with parts and ammunition.\u201d\n\nThanks to gun laws passed back in 1996, guns aren\u2019t really a \u201cthing\u201d in Australia. We\u2019re not immune to gun-related crimes, but you wouldn\u2019t exactly expect your neighbour to be walking down the street with a rifle. So it\u2019s probably not a good idea to be walking down the street with a realistic-looking gun at midnight. But it turns out the gel blaster is just as illegal as a real gun.\n\nGel blasters like this one, are considered firearms in New South Wales. This means you need to have a license or permit to possess one, even though it\u2019s not a real gun. Whether it shoots real bullets or paint bullets, you\u2019d better make sure it\u2019s registered properly because the police will absolutely take it seriously.\n\nThe toy guns are currently legal in South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania, but require a permit in NSW and Victoria, according to 9News.\n\nThe 19-year-old was arrested at the scene and taken to the local police station. According to the police report, the man was charged with possession of an unregistered firearm and being an unauthorised person possessing a firearm.\n\nHe has been granted conditional bail and will appear at Milton Local Court this Thursday.\n\nJust a handy word of advice, probably don\u2019t carry your very real-looking fake gun around in public. If a police officer catches you with a fake gun, you never know if they\u2019ll pull out their real one.", "description": "A 19-year-old man has been arrested at gunpoint in Ulladulla after police caught him carrying a \"gel blaster\" that looked like an assault rifle.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/GelBlaster.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
