DNA testing is still being conducted to confirm identities of 7 of the 34 victims recovered.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/conception?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#conception</a> \u2014@sbsheriff\n\nAuthorities were still doing DNA tests to confirm the identities of seven of the victims.\n\nEarlier in the day, the U.S. Coast Guard announced it has issued new safety recommendations in the wake of the tragedy near Santa Cruz Island, such as limiting the unsupervised charging of lithium-ion batteries and the use of power strips and extension cords.\n\nThe bulletin also suggests that owners and operators of vessels review emergency duties with the crew, identify emergency escapes, check all firefighting and life-saving equipment onboard, and look at the condition of passenger accommodation spaces for \"unsafe practices or other hazardous arrangements.\"\n\nThe cause of the Sept. 2 fire has yet to be determined. Salvage efforts to recover the Conception \u2014 which authorities have said is expected to aid the investigation \u2014 resumed this week after several days of weather delays.\n\nFive of the Conception's six crew members survived and told investigators they made multiple attempts to save the people who were trapped below deck.\n\nAuthorities have said they are looking at several factors in their investigation, including how batteries and electronics were stored and charged. They will also look into how the crew was trained and what crew members were doing at the time of the fire, which erupted in the middle of the night as the passengers slept.\n\nA memorial to those who died aboard the dive boat Conception is seen Friday, Sept. 6, in Santa Barbara, Calif.

Terrill/The Associated Press)\n\nThe boat's design will also come under scrutiny, particularly whether a bunk room escape hatch was adequate.\n\nThe FBI, U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles are conducting a criminal investigation, and the coast guard has convened a formal Marine Board of Investigation.\n\nThe four members of the board will look into \"pre-accident historical events, the regulatory compliance of the Conception, crew member duties and qualifications, weather conditions and reporting, safety and firefighting equipment, and coast guard oversight.\"\n\nThat investigation is expected to take at least a year. The panel will seek to determine the factors that led to the fire, any possible evidence of misconduct, inattention to duty, negligence or willful ignorance of the law, and if any other factors caused or contributed to the deaths.\n\nCoast guard records show the Conception passed its two most recent inspections with no safety violations. Previous customers said the company that owns the vessel, Truth Aquatics, and the captains of its three boats were very safety conscious.\n\nAuthorities have said 21 women and 13 men ranging from 16 to 62 years old appear to have died from smoke inhalation.", "description": "Divers on Wednesday recovered the body of the last missing victim of a boat fire off the California coast that killed 34 people.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5280370.1568248312!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1172293276.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
