She also lamented a lack of \u201cdisciplined, direct coverage of race relations and the culture wars.\u201d Ms. Barnes said the network was looking into establishing a beat for that topic.\n\nIn response, about 85 of NPR\u2019s 569 newsroom and programming staffers cosigned an email sent Thursday to Ms. Barnes, who was named NPR\u2019s top news executive last year, saying she failed to recognize the strides they have made in covering racism, anti-Semitism and hate-driven violence.\n\n\u201cThese words travel and not only are they hurtful, they further marginalize people of color in an organization with historic problems of under-representing and/or dismissing the voices, creativity and work of non-white journalists,\u201d they wrote in the email, according to a copy reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. \u201cRobust coverage of the issues you want to expand has been alive and well.\u201d\n\nNPR covers race from a variety of angles on multiple shows and platforms. The network\u2019s Code Switch team focuses on race and identity, and race relations are frequently discussed on shows such as \u201cIt\u2019s Been A Minute\u201d and \u201cAlt.Latino.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Ms. Barnes apologized for her remarks, saying she regrets that she \u201cdidn\u2019t speak to what we\u2019re already doing and have done in the past\u201d during her remarks at the conference.\n\n\u201cIn my remarks at a recent public radio conference, I shared some thoughts on how we will tackle critical issues, including race and racism,\u201d wrote Ms. Barnes, who most recently served as executive editor of the Houston Chronicle. \u201cWhat I intended to convey was that I was looking for more resources to augment this important work on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nThe NPR employees asked Ms. Barnes, who is white, to address their concerns in an all-staff town hall meeting. They also called for more diversity in NPR\u2019s leadership ranks. In a reply, Ms. Barnes said she was out of the office but would set up a meeting upon her return.\n\n\u201cThank you for sharing your concerns with me; I want you to know that I take them seriously,\u201d Ms. Barnes said.\n\nSome NPR programming dedicated to diversity-related themes has been curtailed in recent years. \u201cTell Me More,\u201d which was hosted by \u201cAll Things Considered\u201d host Michel Martin, was shut down in 2014. NPR\u2019s former ombudsman, Edward Schumacher-Matos, wrote in an article at the time that the decision drew backlash from many of the network\u2019s listeners.\n\nNPR receives a small amount of revenue from the government-funded Corporation for Public Broadcasting, but its largest source of funding is the dues and fees paid to NPR by its many member stations.\n\nThis week, NPR announced that media veteran John Lansing would succeed Jarl Mohn as the network\u2019s chief executive.\n\nWrite to Benjamin Mullin at Benjamin.Mullin@wsj.com", "description": "National Public Radio\u2019s news chief is facing an internal backlash over public remarks she made criticizing the network\u2019s coverage of race relations.", "authors": ["Benjamin Mullin", "Benjamin.Mullin Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104905/social", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
