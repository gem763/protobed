Standing feet away from Vladimir Putin at a press conference following their Helsinki tete-a-tete, a reporter challenged Trump to condemn Putin for Russia\u2019s election interference, \u201cin front of the world.\u201d Instead, the world watched as the president of the United States took Putin\u2019s side against his own Justice Department and his own intelligence agencies, and launched into a rambling discourse about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and a supposedly missing DNC server that hides the truth about Putin\u2019s innocence.\n\n\u201cYou have groups that are wondering why the FBI never took the server. Why didn\u2019t they take the server? Where is the server, I want to know, and what is the server saying?\u201d\n\nThe server is saying shut up.\n\nThe \u201cserver\u201d Trump is obsessed with is actually 140 servers, most of them cloud-based, which the DNC was forced to decommission in June 2016 while trying to rid its network of the Russian GRU officers working to help Trump win the election, according to the figures in the DNC\u2019s civil lawsuit against Russia and the Trump campaign. Another 180 desktop and laptop computers were also swapped out as the DNC raced to get the organization back on its feet and free of Putin\u2019s surveillance.\n\nBut despite Trump\u2019s repeated feverish claims to the contrary, no machines are actually missing.\n\n\u201c Despite Trump\u2019s repeated feverish claims to the contrary, no machines are actually missing. \u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that the FBI doesn\u2019t have the DNC\u2019s computer hardware. Agents didn\u2019t sweep into DNC headquarters, load up all the equipment and leave Democrats standing stunned beside empty desks and dangling cables. There\u2019s a reason for that, and it has nothing to do with a deep state conspiracy to frame Putin.\n\nTrump and his allies are capitalizing on a basic misapprehension of how computer intrusion investigations work. Investigating a virtual crime isn\u2019t a like investigating a murder. The Russians didn\u2019t leave DNA evidence on the server racks and fingerprints on the keyboards. All the evidence of their comings and goings was on the computer hard drives, and in memory, and in the ephemeral network transmissions to and from the GRU\u2019s command-and-control servers.\n\nWhen cyber investigators respond to an incident, they capture that evidence in a process called \u201cimaging.\u201d They make an exact byte-for-byte copy of the hard drives. They do the same for the machine\u2019s memory, capturing evidence that would otherwise be lost at the next reboot, and they monitor and store the traffic passing through the victim\u2019s network. This has been standard procedure in computer intrusion investigations for decades. The images, not the computer\u2019s hardware, provide the evidence.\n\nBoth the DNC and the security firm Crowdstrike, hired to respond to the breach, have said repeatedly over the years that they gave the FBI a copy of all the DNC images back in 2016. The DNC reiterated that Monday in a statement to the Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cThe FBI was given images of servers, forensic copies, as well as a host of other forensic information we collected from our systems,\u201d said Adrienne Watson, the DNC\u2019s deputy communications director. \u201cWe were in close contact and worked cooperatively with the FBI and were always responsive to their requests. Any suggestion that they were denied access to what they wanted for their investigation is completely incorrect.\u201d\n\nThe FBI declined comment for this story, but in testimony before the House Intelligence Committee last year, then-director James Comey said that Crowdstrike \u201cultimately shared with us their forensics.\u201d\n\nAt that same hearing, Comey complained that the DNC didn\u2019t give the FBI direct access to the DNC\u2019s servers. It\u2019s unclear why Comey wanted the FBI operating on the DNC\u2019s live network, but if the DNC demurred it wouldn\u2019t be an unusual call, particularly five months before election day.\n\n\u201cThe FBI is looking to investigate and prosecute crimes, and we\u2019re looking to return a system to operation as quickly as possible with minimal impact,\u201d said Rendition Infosec\u2019s Jake Williams, one of several incident response professionals interviewed for this story. \u201cI can tell you honestly that had I been part of that incident response, I would not have advocated calling in the FBI. Every minute the FBI spends keeping the actors in play, that\u2019s a minute I don\u2019t get back in prepping for the election. I would absolutely have shared images with them.\u201d\n\nKenn White, a security expert and former DHS adviser, agreed that the FBI wouldn\u2019t have expected direct access to DNC\u2019s computers, \u201cThe FBI had one of the best cyber security firms in the world giving them forensics, and going in depth and reverse engineering to the byte level these implants and turning it over.\u201d\n\nIn some versions of the servergate conspiracy theory now espoused by Trump, nothing less than physical possession of the hardware will suffice, because Crowdstrike, a respected security firm helmed by a former senior FBI agent, might be part of the deep state\u2019s efforts to frame Putin. White scoffs at that notion, noting that National Republican Congressional Committee is one of Crowdstrike\u2019s customers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done incident response for defense contractors and healthcare groups, this is all standard practice,\u201d said White. \u201cIt\u2019s completely defensible in terms of best practices and what was going on.\u201d\n\n\u201c We were in close contact and worked cooperatively with the FBI. Any suggestion that they were denied access to what they wanted for their investigation is completely incorrect. \u201d \u2014 DNC's Adrienne Watson\n\nIt\u2019s also consistent with the Department of Justice\u2019s electronic evidence manual, which recommends capturing images when practical even when the FBI is executing a search warrant against a uncooperative suspect. When the computers belong to a cooperating victim, seizing the machines is pretty much out of the question, said James Harris, a former FBI cybercrime agent who worked on a 2009 breach at Google that\u2019s been linked to the Chinese government.\n\n\u201cIn most cases you don\u2019t even ask, you just assume you\u2019re going to make forensic copies,\u201d said Harris, now vice president of engineering at PFP Cyber. \u201cFor example when the Google breach happened back in 2009, agents were sent out with express instructions that you image what they allow you to image, because they\u2019re the victim, you don\u2019t have a search warrant, and you don\u2019t want to disrupt their business.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a final bit of evidence that the FBI got what it wanted from the DNC, and it was filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. last Friday: 29-pages of inside details showing exactly how and when the GRU\u2019s hackers moved through the DNC\u2019s network on their mission to help Trump.\n\nIf the president really wants to know what the DNC server is saying, it\u2019s all in the indictment against Putin\u2019s hackers. He just has to listen.", "description": "The president can spout conspiracy theories all he wants. But the DNC turned over all its key data to the FBI after it got hacked.
