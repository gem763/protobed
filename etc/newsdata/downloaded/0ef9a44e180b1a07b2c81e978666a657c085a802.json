In the dressing room, we were all as disappointed as him. We let him down, we let the club down.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t terrible. We just didn\u2019t seem to click, didn\u2019t put anything together. We have to win these games. We have to show we\u2019re a better side than this. It\u2019s a tough feeling right now.\n\n\"We just have to apologise to the supporters, too. We let them down. They travel with us everywhere and they\u2019re first-class. We need everyone behind us now to help us push on through this difficult time.\u201d\n\nTottenham returned to training on Wednesday, ahead of this weekend\u2019s Southampton clash, and Davies added: \u201cIt\u2019s a huge game for uss. We need to start getting that winning feeling back because it seems a long way away after losing games like that.\u201d\n\nPochettino talked about using the next two transfer windows to fix problems in his squad, following the shock Colchester shock.\n\nTelegraph Sport understands that, particularly in January, his reference to the transfer market related more to trimming a squad that the Argentine feels is already bloated.\n\nEriksen, Alderweireld and Vertonghen are all in charge of their own destinies, while the contracts of Eric Dier and Moussa Sissoko run to 2021. Doubts also remain over the futures of Danny Rose, Victor Wanyama and Serge Aurier, who were all made available in the summer.", "description": "Tottenham Hotspur chairman Daniel Levy is prepared to fight any threat of losing Harry Kane at the end of what could prove to be another trophyless season by slapping a huge \u00a3250million valuation on the striker.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dV.GOi_73nG6jnkZpF7D7A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/T0DPCH5tXZw2b2Tw9z63Rg--~B/aD0xMjUwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/f7bd3aba59c9d6d58ddf3272f18a7480", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
