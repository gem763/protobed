Kevin is the executive vice president of Arnold Ventures. He\u2019s a Republican strategist and former advisor to President George W. Bush, Governor Mitt Romney, and Republican House leaders John Boehner and Tom DeLay. Kevin is on Twitter at @KevinMaddenDC.\n\nKevin\u2019s Music Pick: The Cars\n\nThe team at Political Beats mourns the death of Ric Ocasek by doing what we do best: obsessively listening to and breaking down his career in The Cars. This is a nice, tight compact show, like the best of their hits. In fact, we dove so deep into their discography that you might think we\u2019re foolish. All three of us are really big fans of the debut album and Ben Orr\u2019s vocals. And all of us choose a different second-favorite album alongside the consensus number one, THE CARS, one of the best debut albums of all time. Why don\u2019t we know Ric\u2019s real age? Why did \u201cYou Might Think\u201d win the first MTV Video Music Award, beating out \u201cThriller\u201d? How did Elliot Easton score a solo album deal in the 1980s? Answers to those questions and much more on this week\u2019s tribute to Ric Ocasek and The Cars.", "description": "Scot and Jeff discuss The Cars with Kevin Madden.", "authors": ["Andrew C.
