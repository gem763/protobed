Dacia and Suzuki - still have a manual handbrake fitted across their entire range of models.\n\nSome motorists may be dubious about the safety or reliability of the new technology after a spate of recalls by brands for potentially faulty electronic brake systems.\n\nVolkswagen issued a recall for 134,000 UK cars in 2017 over problems with its parking brake, affecting Golf, Touran, Tiguan and Passat models.\n\nThe same year, Tesla issued a global recall of 53,000 cars and Audi, Renault and Toyota have all also had to recall models over electronic brake faults in the past.\n\nThe risk of hacking attacks also rises as ever more electronics are introduced into vehicles.\n\nResearchers have previously demonstrated their ability to hack the computers in cars, remotely controlling steering, acceleration and braking.\n\nThe AA says it is 'broadly in favour' of electronic systems as they hold cars more securely but warns that they could confuse drivers without 'consumer education'.\n\nWithin a few years, mechanical handbrakes will be consigned to history alongside chokes, cassette players and wind-up windows (stock photo)\n\nIts head of road policy Jack Cousens said: 'Electronic parking devices are simple to use and reduce the scope for human error as they set the brake tension to the correct level.\n\n'They put an end to cars rolling down inclines because the handbrake was not fully on and they make hill starts easier.\n\n'We see it more as a consumer education issue for car buyers or hirers.\n\n'It is simply a ten second lesson where the garage or car hire firm points out the device, so that drivers are not left scrabbling around, wondering where the handbrake is.'\n\nHe said that electronic systems remove the physical effort of yanking a chunky lever and free up space in the centre console.\n\nWith the technology - first used on the BMW 7 Series in 2001 - becoming ever more affordable, the manual method is likely to be phased out entirely over the next few years.\n\nThe CarGurus study found that only 30 per cent of new models now have handbrakes, down from 37 per cent in 2018.\n\nCarGurus UK editor Chris Knapman confirmed that the handbrake is heading for extinction..\n\nHe said: 'It's official, the death of the handbrake is coming as manufacturers switch to electronic parking brakes in huge numbers.\n\n'They have rapidly gone from being a novelty to what our research shows is now the norm.\n\n'Within the next few years we expect the number of cars on sale with traditional handbrakes to decline further, likely only to be found on a select number of niche models.\n\n'These systems might lack the tactile feel that some drivers value from a traditional manual parking brake but they bring several benefits in terms of convenience, safety and packaging.\n\n'An electronic parking brake can engage automatically when a car's engine is switched off and many also include an auto-hold function that will apply the parking brake when a car is stopped in traffic or on a hill.\n\n'Electronic parking brakes are also easier to install than their manual equivalents and replacing a handbrake lever with a simple button frees up more space in a car's interior \u2013 useful perhaps for an extra cup holder or two!'\n\nBut he added that the trend for electronic devices might take some of the fun out of driving for new motorists.\n\nHe said: 'Of course, the benefits can't be ignored but as the latest technology trickles through manufacturer line-ups, many new drivers might never experience one of the most familiar of automotive features.\n\n'The temptation to attempt flamboyant handbrake turns is soon to be a thing of the past too!'\n\nEarlier this week, it emerged that some of the world's biggest makers of self-driving cars want US regulators to remove the requirement for steering wheels, pedals and mirrors.\n\nCompanies including Honda, Uber, Waymo and Lyft, which are developing autonomous cars, want the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to recognise self-driving cars as a separate vehicle class to address the rules.", "description": "Only three in ten new cars in showrooms today have manual handbrakes as manufacturers switch to electronic devices.", "authors": ["Colin Fernadez Science Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/13/21/18458976-0-image-a-13_1568408381997.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
