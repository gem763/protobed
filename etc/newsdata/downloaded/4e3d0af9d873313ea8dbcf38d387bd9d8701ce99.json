I can't keep up with myself. We just went on one date.'\n\nShe joked she didn't think the personal trainer was 'fine' before revealing he was still lavishing her with gifts.\n\n'I don't think he's fine. He sent me flowers yesterday with peacock feathers. He knew I wanted to be a peacock,' she added.\n\nSingle: The Scottish reality star, 30, put an end to dating claims with the hunk, 31, after they were pictured together at the Creme de la Creme Ball last month\n\n'Why do I have no filter and why do you get everything out of me.'\n\nLaura sparked rumours that she was dating The Bachelor UK star Alex after they put on a cosy display at the Creme de la Creme ball on Saturday, September 21.\n\nShe stunned in a fitted red gown as she arrived at the ball in Cheshire with Alex on her arm.\n\nSmitten? Yet despite cooling things off Alex still gifted Laura a bouquet of flowers interlaced with peacock feathers on Thursday before her appearance at the KISS Haunted House Party at the SSE Arena in Wembley on Friday\n\nLaura recently returned to her former home in Dubai following her split from Max Morley.\n\nThe star called it quits from Love Island 2015 star Max, 26, at the end of July, with sources claiming it's over for good this time around.\n\nAn insider told The Sun: 'It's really sad but it's over again between them. Things had got really serious - his dad was even building them a house up north to live in - but it's not worked out.\n\nNot to be: When asked if she was at the party with Alex, Laura said: 'I knew you were going to ask me that. I can't keep up with myself. We just went on one date.'\n\n'They've unfollowed each other on Instagram and it's properly over this time.'\n\nThe blonde, who previously dated musician Dane Bowers, was in a relationship with Paul Knops at the end of Love Island 2018, with the couple finishing in second place behind show winners Dani Dyer and Jack Fincham.\n\nIt comes after the blonde beauty spoke to OK! online about her plastic surgery regrets, before warning girls against breast implants.\n\nCheeky: She joked she didn't think the personal trainer was 'fine' before revealing he was still lavishing her with gifts\n\nLaura went to The Private Clinic recently to get a breast reduction after she started working out more in the gym.\n\nShe realised the breast implants she had put in when she was 18-years-old were actually getting in her way.\n\nShe said: 'Fashion changes but your body doesn\u2019t need to.\n\nHome: Laura recently returned to her former home in Dubai following her split from Max Morley\n\n'I got my boobs done when I was 18 years old. I did it without telling my parents.\n\n'But I\u2019ve got a breast reduction because they caused me a bit of pain, they really were too big.'\n\nLaura advised wearing padded bras if girls want to look like they have larger breasts, because to her it only really matters how she looks with clothes on.\n\nBreak-up: The star called it quits from Love Island 2015 star Max, 26, at the end of July, with sources claiming it's over for good this time around\n\nAnd surgery is a very permanent action to take, she added.\n\nAt Friday's party Laura said: 'Fashion changes and I wanted to get them smaller. I'm working out more and they get in the way.\n\n'The main message is for me if I could go back I wouldn't have had them done the first time because when you get them done once you have to get them done again.'\n\nLaura, a former air steward, was runner-up on ITV's Love Island in 2018.\n\nAnd she was fully supportive of 'winter Love Island', which will be filmed in South Africa from January 8.\n\n'It's a massive show I think ITV would be stupid not to make something of it,' she said.\n\nShe joked another Love Island series means she has more opportunity to find men, as they will all attend the same events once the show finishes.\n\n'I just see it as I'll get more pals, maybe more men. I've made a lot of friends. I'm going on a trip next week and I've looked at the list and loads of past Love Islanders are going and I like them all,' she added.", "description": "The Scottish reality star, 30, put an end to dating claims with the hunk, 31, after they\u00a0were pictured together at the Creme de la Creme Ball last month.", "authors": ["Emer Scully For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/17/20210926-0-image-a-234_1572105786050.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
