The question is, are there cost benefits for consumers? It may be a case of diminishing returns.\u201d\n\nAmong the other requirements of the framework are the need to register accountable persons, submit accountability maps, defer bonuses for up to seven years and introduce clawback provisions of up to four years after they are paid out.\n\nFSC boss Sally Loane said it was important there was no impact on consumers. Lucas Jarvis, Eventive Photography\n\nThe Financial Services Council, which represents more than 100 companies, said it wanted to better understand how it would be rolled out before giving its unconditional support.\n\nCouncil CEO Sally Loane said she supported the extension of the BEAR in principle, but the FSC wanted to be sure there was not an impact on the consumers of its products.\n\n\u201cThe FSC will continue to work constructively with Treasury and relevant agencies as the royal commission recommendations are implemented, so that any unintended consequences that may impact consumers, such as unwarranted regulatory burden, are avoided,\u201d Ms Loane said.\n\nA spokesman for the ASX said it was aware of the plan to extend the BEAR. He said the securities exchange had already performed significant work on its risk management, governance and accountability processes as part of a broad review following the equity market outage of 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly a matter of interest to us, and we look forward to seeing the detail,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\n\u201cWe are preparing ourselves for this likelihood and believe we\u2019re well placed to implement.\u201d\n\nExtending the BEAR to cover all prudentially regulated institutions was recommendation 6.8 in the Hayne royal commission\u2019s final report. Commissioner Hayne, however, did not mention private health insurers specifically.\n\nModelled on the BEAR framework that covers the banks and is overseen by APRA, the financial services executive and accountability regime \u2013 or FEAR \u2013 will be operated by ASIC, which is understood to be pushing for a wider application of the net to capture more companies.\n\nDuring the initial phases of the rollout of the BEAR regime, APRA said the first attempts from the banks were clumsy and advised the smaller banks that followed to avoid \u201cvague or non-specific descriptions\u201d and to focus on \u201cclarity of wording\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe early ones were good first attempts but needed work ... it's legislation, so you want to pass and you want to pass clearly,\" APRA\u2019s former heard of policy Pat Brennan said last year.", "description": "Representatives for the financial services sector and private health insurers say consumers may pay the price of extending the BEAR regime more broadly.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5365%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/699af702804f43e7e206b210c06d29f1ba9f26d2", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
