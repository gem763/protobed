A U.S. Army official \"briefed on the results of the operation\" told Newsweek that Baghdadi had died. CNN reported that the \"CIA assisted in locating\" him.\n\nWhat they're saying: The reports surfaced soon after President Trump posted a cryptic tweet at 9:23 p.m. saying \"Something very big has just happened!\" and the White House said it would make a \"major statement\" at 9 a.m. on Sunday.\n\nIt's unclear whether the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) were involved in the operation, but its commander Mazloum Abdi and SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali both appeared to tweet about the raid.\n\nThe Turkish Defense Ministry tweeted Sunday, \"Prior to the US Operation in Idlib Province of Syria last night, information exchange and coordination between the military authorities of both countries took place.\"\n\nWhy it matters: Baghdadi was regarded by many as the world\u2019s most-wanted man. He had evaded capture for years amid tight security, per the BBC.\n\nBaghdadi's reported killing comes as Trump faces an impeachment inquiry. He's also received criticism from Democrats and Republicans for his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria amid accusations he abandoned U.S. allied Kurdish forces to face the threat of a Turkish invasion.\n\nThe U.S. had a $25 million bounty on the head of Baghdadi and if the reported operation is proven to be successful, it'd be the most significant counterterrorism raid since the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011.\n\nThe big picture: Last month, an audio message from Baghdadi emerged in which he called on followers to redouble efforts to further the mission of ISIS in an effort to boost the extremist group after it lost control of territories in Iraq and Syria this year.\n\nIn April, ISIS released a video of Baghdadi speaking with masked supporters about events that took place that month amid reports that he had been killed or gravely wounded.\n\nEditor's note: This article has been updated with new details throughout.", "description": "Smart, efficient news worthy of your time, attention, and trust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
