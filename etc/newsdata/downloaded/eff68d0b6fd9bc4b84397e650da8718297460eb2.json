Storment detailed how his days had been dominated by work since he co-founded the Portland cloud management start-up Cloudability in 2011, the same month he had twin boys. And he wrote about the regret he felt about things he wished he had done differently with his son Wiley, who died unexpectedly in his sleep last month of complications from epilepsy.\n\nStorment said that he is struggling to redefine his relationship to work \u2014 and urged other parents not to make the same mistakes.\n\n\u201cA lot of the things you are likely spending your time on you\u2019ll regret once you no longer have the time,\u201d Storment wrote.\n\nParents frequently schedule one-on-one meetings with co-workers, but do they schedule them with their kids? \u201cIf there\u2019s any lesson to take away from this, it\u2019s to remind others (and myself) not to miss out on the things that matter,\u201d he said in his essay.\n\n[Millennials want a work-life balance. Their bosses just don\u2019t get why.]\n\nThe post struck a chord with working parents trying to juggle children and jobs in an age when technology dictates that work begins the moment you pick up your phone in the morning and stops only when you force yourself to put it down.\n\n\u201cThrough the story about this tragic event comes an incredibly important reminder about priorities \u2060 \u2014 one that the term #worklifebalance can\u2019t even begin to describe,\u201d tweeted Jullie Strippoli, an assistant branch manager with Charles Schwab. \u201cI strongly recommend that every working parent read J.R.\u2019s post.\u201d\n\nThrough the story about this tragic event comes an incredibly important reminder about priorities - one that the term #worklifebalance can\u2019t even begin to describe. I strongly recommend that every working parent read J.R.\u2019s post. https://t.co/pm5atPqUUd \u2014 Jullie Strippoli (@JStrippoliCS) September 5, 2019\n\nIn a 2018 Ciphr study of 1,400 working parents, more than half said they felt judged by colleagues or bosses for trying to balance their home and work lives. Both parents and non-parents are increasingly struggling with the threat of burnout, which comes at a significant cost: The Harvard Business Review estimates that $125 billion to $190 billion in health-care spending each year is tied to the physical and psychological tolls of burnout.\n\nOn the morning Storment would learn that his son had died, he rose early for back-to-back meetings and left without saying goodbye, completing two work calls before arriving at the office. When the call came from his wife, Storment was in a meeting with employees in his Portland office regarding paid time off. He had just told them he hadn\u2019t taken more than a contiguous week off in eight years.\n\nStorment hasn\u2019t worked since Wiley died, and he said he\u2019s struggling with how to return \u201cin a way that won\u2019t leave me again with the regrets I have now.\u201d\n\n[Workplace wellness programs work best when bosses buy into them]\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019ve considered not going back,\u201d Storment wrote. \u201cBut I believe in the words of Kahlil Gibran who said, \u2018Work is love made visible.\u2019 To me, that line is a testament to how much we gain, grow and offer through the work we do. But that work needs to have a balance that I have rarely lived.\u201d\n\nWiley was already planning for future business ventures, Storment wrote, including a smoothie stand, a virtual-reality-headset operation and a \u201cspaceship building company.\u201d He would sometimes invite his brother and parents to join in his planning but made it clear that he would take the lead.\n\nThat made reading the words, \u201cOccupation: Never Worked\u201d on his son\u2019s death certificate one of the most painful moments, Storment wrote.\n\nIn the post, Storment described a happy memory that has taken on a sorrowful significance now: dancing with Wiley years earlier at the Oregon Country Fair, while the band performed \u201cEnjoy Yourself (It\u2019s Later Than You Think).\u201d\n\n\u201cYou work and work for years and years, you\u2019re always on the go/ You never take a minute off, too busy makin\u2019 dough,\u201d the song goes in the lead-up to its titular advice, which Storment and his wife are imploring other parents to heed.\n\n[Working from home with children: Tips to make it work]\n\n\u201cWe wish a lot of things were different, but mostly we wish we\u2019d had more time. If you are a parent and have any capacity to spend more time with your kids, do,\u201d Jessica Brandes, Wiley\u2019s mother and Storment\u2019s wife, wrote in her own LinkedIn post. \u201cIt is priceless and should not be squandered. Take your vacation days and sabbaticals and go be with them. You will not regret the emails you forgot to send.\u201d", "description": "A Portland tech executive shared how the death of his 8-year-old son forced him to rethink how he has oriented his life around work.", "authors": ["Taylor Telford", "Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News", "September At Pm", "Taylor Telford Is A Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KuiTcfugeEwnvibHX2U9b74W1ds=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TTW25YGP6MI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
