Still, the best-selling author is on a mission to convince everyone to join him in almost completely cutting out animal products from their diets.\n\n\u201cEating Animals,\u201d Foer\u2019s 2009 nonfiction book on modern factory farming, famously convinced Natalie Portman to go vegan. In his new book, \u201cWe Are the Weather: Saving the Planet Begins at Breakfast,\u201d Foer argues that avoiding meat is a critical step everyone should take to help tackle the climate crisis. He cites a Johns Hopkins University report that concludes we won\u2019t be able to avoid temperature increases of more than 2 degrees Celsius (about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) \u2014 beyond which catastrophic climate change becomes much more likely \u2014 if global trends in meat and dairy intake continue.\n\nFoer told HuffPost this week that he continues to wrestle with his own temptations to eat meat and dairy products, but said he manages to not eat animal products during the day \u2014 the \u201cvegan before 6 p.m.\u201d diet. He also talked about his thoughts on President Donald Trump, meat taxes, the future of livestock farmers and his own health and well-being since becoming vegetarian.\n\nYou wrote a book about not eating meat back in 2009. What you brought back to the subject again?\n\nI actually wanted to write a book about climate change and my own really problematic relationship to it, which had begun to feel intolerably problematic. Knowing what I knew, believing what I believed, feeling what I felt and yet doing, well, nothing. The problem was when you look into the things, eating fewer animal products is, according to climate scientists, one of the most important things you can do as an individual to work against climate change.\n\nRosdiana Ciaravolo via Getty Images Jonathan Safran Foer in Milan on Sept. 9.\n\nHow would you describe yourself and your diet now?\n\nI am not nuts about phrases or words. I\u2019ve become interested in the idea of a plan. A month ago, at the end of a reading and book-signing I did in Belgium, a young couple due to get married came and gave me their book, which had their own handwriting over the title page. On it, they had a plan: eat vegetarian unless served meat at a friend\u2019s house and there\u2019s no other option. Eat vegan twice a week. Have no more than two kids. And drive no more than 930 miles a year.\n\nInstead of signing it, they wanted me to witness it. I found that really eye-opening because I realized I didn\u2019t have a plan. I\u2019d written a book and yet I felt surprised by my own lack of preparation. It\u2019s easy to get lost in identifiers \u2014 I\u2019m a vegetarian or vegan \u2014 or in emotions like someone\u2019s got to solve this, or we should fly less.\n\nA plan is in between these. It\u2019s difficult because you have to confront the unambitiousness of your plan. You have to be honest. So I went back to my hotel and made my plan: eat vegan for breakfast and lunch. Eat vegetarian for dinner. Not fly on any vacations. Take only three cab rides a week. Give one full day a week to volunteering to help raise awareness of climate change.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the child-free movement and not having children?\n\nIt\u2019s the ultimate modification for some people, rather than a daily one. And without a doubt the largest problem when you come to climate change is overpopulation. I didn\u2019t think about it myself at the time because there wasn\u2019t the same consciousness about it.\n\nYou could make an argument that Greta Thunberg is the most important person in the struggle to save the planet. You could make the argument Trump is, as his complete ignorance has forced wisdom on Americans. Jonathan Safran Foer\n\nPeople over 40 have created so many problems for people under 40 to solve and created so many burdens. I feel sorry that this is yet another thing that people have to consider that my generation did not consider. That being said, if I was in that point in my life, I would be a very enthusiastic adopter. I don\u2019t think it would be a struggle. To me, [adopting a child] would be an even more special choice.\n\nIn the past, you\u2019ve said that environmentalists who eat meat have a blindspot. Do you now believe that anyone who believes in climate change but eats meat has a blindspot?\n\nWell, that\u2019s not an opinion. That\u2019s just a fact. The science is totally uncontroversial and unambiguous. The IPCC [the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations-backed panel of climate scientists] has said we have no hope in solving this problem unless we dramatically reduce meat consumption.\n\nOne of the things that shocked me on the book tour I\u2019ve just done is that 90% of the climate scientists and environmentalists I\u2019ve met are vegetarian. And the ones that aren\u2019t eat very little meat. It\u2019s something that seems to go without saying. I wish they would talk about it more, but it\u2019s been heartening to see.\n\nDo you have sympathy for livestock farmers, and the ones who claim pasture-fed livestock \u2014 i.e., animals reared on grass-based diet \u2014 can help sequester carbon through the growing of grass?\n\nA forest will sequester more carbon than grassland. So yes, it does sequester more carbon to have cattle on a regenerative pasture, but it would be far better still to get rid of all the livestock and have forest. If this happened, we could sequester half of all human-made carbon emissions. I have huge sympathy for good farmers who treat animals and the earth well.\n\nThe enemy is not farmers; it\u2019s industrial agriculture. The Democrats are now choosing who will be their presidential candidate and pandering to voters in those states that make the vote first: Iowa and New Hampshire. And in Iowa, the farming capital of the U.S., they are proposing anti-factory farming legislation.\n\nDuxX via Getty Images Intensive agriculture has a huge environmental impact.\n\nThat is what it means to pander to real farmers today. [Farmers] despise industrial farming. Its whole model is based on having as few farmers and as little nature as possible. No farmer went into farming to be cruel to animals or to be destructive to the environment. The enemy is the factory-farming complex.\n\nCan individual choices really make a difference in tackling climate change?\n\nWe\u2019ve reached this moment where there\u2019s this weird rift between people who think individuals need to play a large role and those who think that to talk about individual choice is to let big corporations off the hook. Individual choice, corporate practice and government legislation are all in a feedback loop.\n\nAs people ask or insist upon different things and change their habits, corporations provide different things. It\u2019s not a coincidence that in the past six months Burger King, Taco Bell, McDonald\u2019s, Subway, Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and every fast food chain in America is selling plant-based meat alternatives.\n\nSmith Collection/Gado via Getty Images A Burger King in the San Francisco Bay Area advertising the Impossible Whopper, a meat-free burger made from plant protein.\n\nIt\u2019s not for public relations or that they awoke to some ethics. It\u2019s because they know that\u2019s what people want, and they want to make more money. What\u2019s interesting is that as citizens have forced them to offer those alternatives, it makes it easier for us to make those choices. We need legislative action, but I don\u2019t see it happening without individual action.\n\nSo does Trump pulling the U.S. pulling out of U.N. climate deal made in Paris in 2015 make a difference?\n\nThere are only two countries in the world [Morocco and the Gambia] which will meet the goals of that agreement. And the U.S. wouldn\u2019t have met the goals if Hillary Clinton had been elected president. There\u2019s something psychologically soothing about remaining in the agreement while failing to meet its goals.\n\nYou could make an argument that Greta Thunberg is the most important person in the struggle to save the planet. You could make the argument Trump is, as his complete ignorance has forced wisdom on Americans. His complete inaction has forced action.\n\nI do not think we\u2019d have seen millions of people on the streets, the ascendancy of plant-based meats and the environmental movement far stronger than it\u2019s ever been if he hadn\u2019t been the president. He\u2019s made things so terrible and feel so dark that it has inspired a pushback, which has been really wonderful to see.\n\nWould you support a meat tax or any restriction on buying it?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t apply it specifically to meat, but I think a carbon tax is a great idea. There\u2019s another way of thinking about this. Let\u2019s not think of it as a sin tax, let\u2019s just make things what they actually cost. If we are all paying for the environmental cost of the clean-up of the meat industry, why don\u2019t we just make them pay for it?\n\nEating meat is not a sin. It\u2019s not an evil thing to do, but right now it has an aspect of shoplifting to it. The [meat] industry is stealing from us and the planet and we\u2019re not aware of it. Someone does have to pay for the environmental clean-up of the planet and it\u2019s not us at the cash register and it\u2019s not them [the meat industry]. It\u2019s our grandkids. Whether it be an airplane ticket or a vegetable shipped halfway around the world, things should cost what they actually cost.\n\nHas being vegetarian made any difference to your health or well-being?\n\nI have no idea because I\u2019ve been doing it for so long now. [Note: Foer has been a vegetarian off and on since he was a child.] When I go to the doctor, I seem to be healthy, I have good blood and all that. Would I have more or less energy or would life be any different if I ate meat? I don\u2019t know.\n\nYou hear all the time about people who\u2019ve become vegetarian and suddenly some great thing happens in their life and you hear people who don\u2019t feel as well. I\u2019m sure both cases exist. It\u2019s uncontroversial that vegetarians are at least as healthy and there\u2019s every reason to think they\u2019re healthier and have a longer life expectancy. But it hasn\u2019t been a real part of how I\u2019ve thought about this.\n\nIt\u2019s relieved some alienation that I\u2019ve felt. I\u2019ve known since I was a kid that eating meat made me uncomfortable and I wanted to do as little of it as I could. It doesn\u2019t feel good to hold that knowledge as a secret from yourself in the same way as it doesn\u2019t feel good when it comes to climate change to know that you really should and want to participate in a real way and not just going to a protest march. I\u2019ve noticed that when I start to act on that secret knowledge I feel better, I feel more like myself.\n\nDo you think the discussion around vegetarian diets is still seen as elitist?\n\nA healthy vegetarian diet is cheaper than a meat-based one. It\u2019s also the case that more than twice as many people who make less than $30,000 a year describe themselves as vegetarian than people who make more than $75,000 a year. So it\u2019s clearly not elitist in the sense of costing more.\n\nIt\u2019s better for our bodies, wallets and the planet. That said, there are people who literally do not have access to fruits and vegetables. They live in what we\u2019d call food deserts. They are often pointed at when the elitist argument is made. They\u2019re never pointed at in the sense that this is a problem and we need to make sure nobody lives in a food desert.\n\nIt\u2019s totally unacceptable that anyone should live without access to healthy foods.\n\nThe interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\n\u201cWe are the Weather: Saving the Planet Begins at Breakfast\u201d is published by Penguin and was released on Sept. 17, priced at $20.00.\n\nFor more content and to be part of the \u201cThis New World\u201d community, follow our Facebook page.\n\nHuffPost\u2019s \u201cThis New World\u201d series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.
