As Christine Benz notes, investors could also reasonably match their time horizons for each part of a bond portfolio to the appropriate bond type. Money needed for very short-term expenditures (within the next one to two years) is likely best held in cash, whereas assets needed for purchases within the next several years may be OK in high-quality shorter-term bonds. And if that money isn't needed for four or five years or more, intermediate-term bonds and bond funds may look like a reasonable bet. In this regard, duration can be a helpful tool; if a fund's duration is substantially longer than the intended holding period, there's a mismatch at work.", "description": "This series of articles will tackle the basics of bond investing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/blt82be987fd176accb/5cf5932bd8bbe50306d29a7c/Saving_1x1.svg", "published_at": "2019-06-17"}
