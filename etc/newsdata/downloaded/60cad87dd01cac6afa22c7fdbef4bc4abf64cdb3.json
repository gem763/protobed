The grant is equivalent to 60 per cent of fixed pay and will vest in two tranches.\n\nThe ASA highlighted a 9.8 per cent drop in Worley's total shareholder return in the year ended June 30, citing it as another reason for voting against the remuneration report. Worley's stock, which was trading above $20 a year ago before it announced it was buying Jacobs, closed on Friday at $13.59.\n\nIt is unclear how Dar, the Dubai-based company that owns almost 23 per cent of Worley, will vote its shares. Worley's remuneration report was passed easily in 2018 with 98.5 per cent of votes cast in favour.\n\nWorley is fighting attempts by Dar to obtain more shares and last week confirmed Street Talk's report that it had told the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) it was \"not in shareholders' interest\" for Dar to take a bigger stake or for the two companies to enter a business cooperation agreement.\n\nAustralia's Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act requires foreign companies to notify FIRB if they buy more than 20 per cent of a local company. Acquiring companies can buy up to 3 per cent of a target company's stock every six months once they reach 19 per cent, allowing them to potentially secure control without making a formal takeover bid.\n\nThe Treasury, which has the power to decide when foreign investments are contrary to the national interest, declined to comment on whether it had previously stopped foreign companies creeping up Australian share registers.\n\nLawyers said they were unaware of instances where foreign companies have been blocked from creeping but say the Treasury does not disclose when it forbids companies to creep.\n\nWorley co-founder and former CEO John Grill, who owns about 6.6 per cent of the company, is up for re-election as chairman at the AGM. Catherine Livingstone, the former Telstra chairman who has been a non-executive director since 2007, will resign.", "description": "The Australian Shareholders' Association urges Worley investors to vote against the engineering group's remuneration report at its AGM on Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_102/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/61fb754fa7116f31f1ff0cd404cd11ac123092af", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
