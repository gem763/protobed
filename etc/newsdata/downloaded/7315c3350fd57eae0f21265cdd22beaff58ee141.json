Next year, it is expected to pick up to 3.4 percent, a 0.2-point revision down since April.\n\nThe Hill\u2019s Niv Elis breaks it down here.\n\nThe background: Trump has already imposed tariffs on $360 billion of the roughly $500 billion in Chinese goods imported by the U.S. each year. While the U.S. and China struck a temporary truce on Friday to hold off on further increases, the president is still slated to impose a new round of tariffs in December that would cover almost all Chinese products with U.S. import taxes.\n\nTrump is also set to levy a new round of tariffs on European goods later this week, and has threatened to impose tariffs on all foreign autos and auto parts.\n\nWhile the U.S. economy has remained resilient throughout Trump\u2019s trade battles, economists say it\u2019s unlikely the country will be able to sustain record-low levels of unemployment with further tariffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn tap tomorrow\n\nThe House Financial Services Committee holds a hearing on Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) oversight with CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger, 10 a.m.\n\nThe House Budget Committee holds a hearing entitled \"Strengthening Our Fiscal Toolkit: Policy Options to Improve Economic Resiliency,\" 10 a.m.\n\nThe House Small Business Committee holds a hearing on management and performance challenges at the Small Business Administration,\" 11:30 a.m.\n\nThe House Financial Services Committee holds a hearing on renewing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program,\" 2 p.m.\n\nThe Joint Economic Committee holds a hearing on measuring economic inequality in the U.S., 2:15 p.m.\n\nLEADING THE DAY\n\nNY prosecutors urge appeals court not to block subpoena for Trump's tax returns: The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office on Tuesday urged a federal appeals court to deny President Trump Donald John TrumpBusiness school deans call for lifting country-specific visa caps Bolton told ex-Trump aide to call White House lawyers about Ukraine pressure campaign: report Federal prosecutors in New York examining Giuliani business dealings with Ukraine: report MORE\u2019s effort to block prosecutors\u2019 subpoena for his tax returns.\n\nTrump has \u201cestablished neither a likelihood of success on the merits of his constitutional claim to immunity, nor that he would suffer irreparable harm should the Court allow production under the grand jury subpoena to proceed in the ordinary course,\u201d the district attorney\u2019s office said in a court filing.\n\n\u201cBy contrast, continued delay poses serious concerns for the Office of the District Attorney for New York County and the People of the State of New York: It risks the expiration of statutes of limitation that apply to some of the transactions being investigated by the grand jury, and would immediately infringe rights and obligations of the District Attorney,\u201d the filing added.\n\nThe Hill\u2019s Naomi Jagoda breaks it down here.\n\nTurkish bank linked to Giuliani client charged with fraud, money laundering: Federal prosecutors have charged a Turkish bank with ties to a former client of President Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiBolton told ex-Trump aide to call White House lawyers about Ukraine pressure campaign: report Federal prosecutors in New York examining Giuliani business dealings with Ukraine: report Ex-Trump aide on Russia testifies for 10 hours as part of impeachment inquiry MORE in connection with an alleged scheme to evade sanctions on Iran, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nThe six-count indictment alleges that Turkiye Halk Bankasii AS (Halkbank) was part of a conspiracy to give Tehran access to billions of dollars in defiance of sanctions that it concealed from U.S. regulators.\n\n\u201cAs alleged in today\u2019s indictment, Halkbank\u2019s systemic participation in the illicit movement of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of Iranian oil revenue was designed and executed by senior bank officials,\u201d U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey Berman said in a statement.\n\nThe Hill\u2019s Zack Budryk tells us more about this breaking story here.\n\nThe Trump connection:\n\nZarrab eventually pleaded guilty and testified against Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who headed international banking at Halkbank, also claiming Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was aware of the laundering effort.\n\nGOOD TO KNOW\n\nPresident Trump hired 281 lobbyists to his administration by the halfway point of his first term, which is four times more than President Obama hired six years into office.\n\nThe Department of Education reportedly blocked the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) efforts to investigate high rejection rates among applicants for a student loan forgiveness program meant to aid firefighters, police, and other public servants.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal: \u201cWho Pays What in Taxes?
