Jackson, Steph Curry, Serena Williams, and Natalie Portman with students eager to learn their crafts.\n\nHe told Business Insider that this campaign demonstrated how marketers were eager to connect more directly with consumers.\n\nRead more: Here are the latest executive power moves that help explain everything that's going on at MasterClass, Github and Intel\n\nMasterClass wants to raise awareness of its brand by moving beyond social-media marketing.\n\nIn the past, MasterClass promoted itself via a combination of pay-for-performance ads and organic social-media content, most of which highlighted the short trailers for its 12-minute celebrity \"sessions.\"\n\nNow Schriber plans to expand the scope of those efforts with a broader and more expensive cross-platform campaign as the brand attempts to move from a video product to a lifestyle offering for its most dedicated customers.\n\n\"You don't have to get the whole message into a 60-second film,\" he said. \"It could be one and a half seconds on Instagram, a single image or a few words on Twitter, something that flashes large out of home. It could be three minutes on YouTube.\"\n\nAds featuring Wintour's famous face ran in The New York Times' Sunday business section and took over Vogue's website. Commuters will also see them in subway stops near the World Trade Center, as well as in sponsored Twitter trends and posts on Instagram and Facebook. Wintour picked the fashion photographer Tyler Mitchell's images for the ads by the renowned designer Jessica Walsh of &Walsh.\n\nThis broad marketing approach will ensure the brand's inspirational message reaches its core demographic of 35-year-olds with an emphasis on young women looking to move up professionally.\n\nMasterClass\n\nAnna Wintour was an ideal ambassador, thanks to her instantly recognizable name and a leadership theme that transcends the MasterClass brand.\n\nSchriber said the brand purposely chose a launch date after Labor Day, New York Fashion Week, and the US Open, adding, \"It's a Monday where everyone nationally is thinking a little more about how they will show up [to work].\"\n\nThe chief marketing officer doesn't believe his company has any direct competitors because, unlike most other e-learning businesses, it doesn't market to students. \"This is more a competition for people's time,\" he said, with MasterClass aspiring to become part of ambitious consumers' attempts to make the hours they spend in front of a screen each day more productive.\n\nMoving forward, MasterClass plans to run similar campaigns that feature ensemble casts or focus on its more famous instructors.\n\n\"You will see this again and again,\" Schriber said. \"It does matter that you [use] multiple touch points and give the consumer an opportunity to tell the story in their head.\"", "description": "MasterClass, an education-tech startup that has raised $136.4 million in funding, launched its first ad campaign this week, and it stars Anna Wintour.", "authors": ["Patrick Coffee"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7c0b3a2e22af3428418bb5-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
