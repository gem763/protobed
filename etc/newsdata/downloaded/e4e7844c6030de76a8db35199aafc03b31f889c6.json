Twitter cut its fourth-quarter revenue forecast to below Wall Street estimates.\n\nTwitter said that it was working on a total fix for the ad problems but that it was not yet in place. Analysts tracking Twitter said the company\u2019s financials would take at least a few more quarters to stabilize, with a quick turnaround looking increasingly unlikely.\n\n\u201cNot expecting a quick rebound in Twitter\u2019s financials for at least a few quarters, as shortfall likely will carry into 2020,\u201d said analyst Craig Huber of Huber Research Partners.\n\nOn the conference call with analysts, Segal said Twitter had turned off some ad settings, which limited how the company could target ads to people or show advertisers how effective their ads were. It acted after finding two bugs that inadvertently shared certain data even if users opted out of sharing it.\n\n\u201cSo we stopped doing that and although we\u2019re working on remediation, there isn\u2019t remediation yet in place and so the effects of that will continue into Q4,\u201d said Segal.\n\nTwitter expects revenue in the fourth-quarter, which will include Black Friday and the December holidays, to be between $940 million and $1.01 billion. Wall Street on average expects $1.06 billion.\n\nThe social media platform did manage to record a rise in daily users who see ads on the site, beating analyst estimates.\n\nTwitter has stopped disclosing its monthly active users figures, instead reporting monetizable daily active usage (mDAU), a metric it created to measure users exposed on a daily basis to advertising through the site or Twitter applications that are able to show ads.\n\nChief Executive Jack Dorsey said growth in mDAU was driven by product improvements, including making the site easier to navigate and more proactively identifying abusive content to remove.\n\nThe company\u2019s average mDAU hit 145 million, beating analyst expectations of 141 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. This alternative metric was up 17% year-over-year.\n\nIn July, Twitter launched a more personalized desktop Twitter.com as part of a plan to make the platform better for conversations. It has also experimented with the ability to follow topics and has recently expanded testing for a feature to hide replies.\n\nRecently, the company made a six-second video bidding available for global advertisers and it has continued to expand its live and on-demand video partnerships, including deals with NBC Olympics and Eurosport for coverage of the 2020 Tokyo Games.\n\nThird-quarter net income was $37 million, or $0.05 per share. In the same period last year, the firm reported net income of $789 million, or $106 million when adjusted to exclude certain items.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed logo for Twitter is seen in this picture illustration made in Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina on January 26, 2016.
