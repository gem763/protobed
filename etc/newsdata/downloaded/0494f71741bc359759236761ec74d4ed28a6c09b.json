That kind of negative story will always get clicks and attention, but the coverage becomes self-fulfilling, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Again, we had to reassure the people around the artist that it would all work, that these stories don\u2019t reflect the attitude of people coming to the festival \u2013 or in the UK, for that matter. It\u2019s just a load of hot air.\u2019\n\nEmily works alongside her father (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nStating the criticism the organisers got \u2018was pretty extreme\u2019 she continued to state it got quite personal, with punters knowing it was Eavis who was behind booking the acts each year.\n\nShe continued: \u2018I was an obvious target. As the child of the founder of something, you\u2019re always going to be criticised, because you\u2019re perceived as doing things differently to how it was done before.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve had to try to develop a thick skin about it, as it can get pretty unpleasant on social media. You can\u2019t please everyone, and the haters tend to be the ones shouting the loudest.\u2019\n\nEavis continued: \u2018I actually had death threats in 2015, which seemed a little harsh \u2013 especially given that we had booked what we considered to be one of the most exciting and innovative artists of his generation. But it worked out for Kanye in the end.\u2019\n\nSpeaking about how Kanye\u2019s set and the immense crowd he gathered in front of the Pyramid Stage led to Adele agreeing to be a part of the festival, Eavis said: \u2018I\u2019d been trying to persuade her, but I think she was unsure. She didn\u2019t really need to do it: she was already playing stadiums, and with her it almost seems like the less she does, the bigger she gets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But I think that deep down she wanted to, as she\u2019d been coming to Glastonbury since she was a little kid.\n\n\u2018I walked her on to the platform next to the stage just before Kanye came on, and we looked out at this huge crowd chanting his name.\n\n\u2018I said: \u201cAre you ready for it? Come on. Next year?\u201d And she looked at me with a twinkle in her eye and said: \u201cI\u2019m gonna do it.\u201d It was such a brilliant moment.\u2019\n\nNext year\u2019s festival has already sold out its first rounds of tickets (with resale happening in April) as the buzz about headliners picks up, with Diana Ross leading the Legends slot.\n\nOne thing we know for sure is that Fleetwood Mac will not be there\u2026\n\nGot a showbiz story?
