Three officials had voted against the decision, with Kansas City Fed President Esther George and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren calling for rates to remain unchanged from their previous level, and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard calling for a more aggressive half-point reduction.\n\n\u201cGoing by the accompanying \u2018dot plot,\u2019 close to a third of officials disagreed with the decision to cut rates at the September meeting, and a third projected leaving rates unchanged from then on. That leaves only a third in favor of more action this year,\u201d Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a note Friday. \u201cThe minutes should give us better insight into what it would take to convince that two-thirds majority to change their mind and vote for another cut later this year.\u201d\n\nIn the weeks since the Fed\u2019s last meeting, data on the domestic economy has weakened considerably, offering a stronger case for lower rates to help prop up flagging growth. As of Tuesday afternoon, markets priced in an about 80% probability of another quarter point cut to the benchmark interest rate after the October meeting, up from around a 30% probability just a few weeks ago.\n\nActivity in the U.S. manufacturing sector, which has been enduring a well-documented slowdown this year, fell to a 10-year low in September, the Institute of Supply Management said last week. The larger U.S. service sector also saw activity decelerate for the month to a three-year low, stoking fears that a growth slowdown had spilled over into sectors that had previously remained more robust. And the September jobs report came in mixed, with unemployment rate hitting a new 50-year low but job gains coming in at a slightly slower-than-expected pace, with softness especially appearing in retail and goods-producing employment.\n\n\u201cIn our view, recent deterioration in ISM business sentiment domestically and abroad, and the continuing trade policy uncertainty are likely to push the core of the committee to cut rates at the October meeting,\u201d James Sweeney of Credit Suisse wrote in a note last week. \u201cThe risk-management argument for one more \u2018insurance cut\u2019 should win out against concerns for financial stability.\u201d\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell holds a news conference following a closed two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington, U.S., September 18, 2019.

Core producer prices, excluding volatile food and energy categories, fell 0.3% for the month, matching the decline in the headline print. Over last year, the core PPI rose just 1.4%, when a gain of 1.8% had been expected. The signs of lessening inflationary pressures also gives room for further easing on the Fed\u2019s part.\n\nThe meeting minutes also come a day after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a speech that the central bank is \u201cnot on a preset course\u201d when it comes to future monetary policy. He added that the next FOMC meeting is still several weeks away, \u201cand we will be carefully monitoring incoming information.\u201d\n\nPowell also confirmed that the central bank would \u201csoon announce measures to add to the supply of reserves over time,\u201d indicating the Fed would restart purchases of Treasury securities to help stabilize money market turbulence. In mid-September, rates in overnight repurchase markets spiked and broke above the Fed benchmark funds rate, with the Fed then having to launch temporary operations to provide cash to address the liquidity squeeze.", "description": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s minutes from its mid-September meeting will pull back the curtain on the deliberations that led to monetary policymaker\u2019s second consecutive rate cut this year, and hint at whether further policy easing is to come.", "authors": ["Emily Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UNgJi1OrAdjHpl383_LlsQ--~B/aD0zODc4O3c9NTgxNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/e8a1bc10-dbc3-11e9-b793-d44138f7f358", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
