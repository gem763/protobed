(REUTERS) (Piroschka Van De Wouw/Reuters)\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation on Monday challenged a House committee\u2019s investigation into Secretary Elaine Chao\u2019s personal and family business dealings, rejecting allegations that she had used her office for her family\u2019s benefit and charging that questions about Chao\u2019s relationship with her father showed a \u201cfundamental lack of understanding\u201d about Asian cultural values.\n\nThe House Oversight and Reform Committee wrote Chao two weeks ago, saying it had launched an investigation into her and was seeking records. The committee\u2019s Democratic leaders said they were troubled by media reports that questioned whether Chao was mixing her family\u2019s private business with her official duties.\n\nThe House committee cited reports in the New York Times, Politico and Wall Street Journal in support of a sweeping request for 18 categories of records to do with Chao and her department\u2019s interactions with her family\u2019s business and her own ethics disclosures.\n\nBut in a letter to committee chairman Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) Monday, the Transportation Department rejected allegations that Chao had taken actions to benefit her family\u2019s shipping company, Foremost Group, had sought to boost her father\u2019s public image and had had a conflict of interest because of stock holdings in a construction materials company.\n\nAdam Sullivan, the Transportation Department\u2019s assistant secretary for governmental affairs, wrote that he \u201cappreciates the opportunity to correct the record.\u201d\n\nChao\u2019s father and sisters own Foremost Group, a New York-based shipping company that carries goods between the United States and China and which has received low interest loans from the Chinese government to buy ships. The committee said the news reports indicate Chao has used her position to bolster the company\u2019s standing in China.\n\nSullivan wrote there were no grounds for Democrats\u2019 concerns.\n\n\u201cThe allegation that the Secretary has used her official position to benefit her family\u2019s business is simply false,\u201d Sullivan wrote. \u201cOf course, the Secretary is not involved with the management or operations of Foremost Group and has no financial stake in the company. Nor does the Department of Transportation regulate, promote, or benefit its business financially.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 letter also cited reports that Chao had appeared alongside her father and the Transportation Department\u2019s seal in interviews with Chinese media, and that her father had boasted about Chao\u2019s access to President Trump.\n\nSullivan wrote Monday that reports raising questions about the interviews had \u201cxenophobic undertones.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is nothing new or nefarious about the fact that Secretary Chao is a role model for immigrants from Asia,\u201d Sullivan wrote.\n\nThe House committee is also seeking information about Chao\u2019s disclosure of holdings in Vulcan Materials Group, a construction materials firm on whose board she previously sat. Chao sold the shares days after the Wall Street Journal reported in March that she continued to hold them.\n\nSullivan wrote that government ethics officials considered the questions over the stock holdings, \u201cclosed.\u201d A Transportation Department ethics official \u201cdetermined that these stock holdings never presented a conflict of interest,\u201d Sullivan wrote.\n\nEven as he pushed back against the basis for the investigation, Sullivan wrote that the Transportation Department planned to respond to the request on a rolling basis.\n\nSullivan\u2019s letter did not address questions the committee raised about a trip Chao planned to China in 2017 that the New York Times reported was canceled because State Department officials were leery of her efforts to include family members in meetings.\n\nAryele Bradford, a spokeswoman for committee Democrats, said the department\u2019s response Monday contained only \u201cgeneric denials\u201d and \u201cfailed to produce the majority of documents the Committee requested relating to these troubling ethics allegations.\n\n\"The Committee expects Secretary Chao to produce all of the documents in an expeditious manner and looks forward to her full cooperation in this investigation,\u201d Bradford said.", "description": "In response to a House investigation, the Transportation Department rejected allegations that Chao had taken actions to benefit her family\u2019s shipping company.", "authors": ["Ian Duncan", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/SmheColNyfHikqwhKxb2Uq1X0rI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BJOIJQW7V4I6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
