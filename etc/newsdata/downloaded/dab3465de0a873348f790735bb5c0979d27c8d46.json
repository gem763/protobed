But then you had the Black Death, and [religion] was a way to face an existential situation that was essentially unmanageable.\n\nToday\u2019s crisis \u2013 climate change and the destruction of the environment \u2013 is the same. \u201cI can\u2019t represent the scale of this crisis that is impacting on us,\" he says. \"Because, if it can be represented, it can be possessed and managed psychologically.\n\n\u201cYou can only make it fail in a decisive and eloquent and infinitely expandable way.\u201d\n\nTalk of climate change brings up Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg and her autism. He feels an affinity, he says. His brother, deceased now, was \"remarkable as a person, but deeply different\".\n\n\"He'd sit outside at my place in the mountains for ages, hours sometimes, looking for shooting stars. He became enormously excited, in a very placid sort of way, like he was really fulfilled when he saw something shooting across the sky. That sort of patience I find very moving,\" he says.\n\nMike Parr begins his 72-hour entombment at Dark Mofo in June.\n\nIn the opening night performance Toward a Black Square \u2013 mark 2, Parr will spend seven to eight hours with his eyes closed attempting to paint perfect Malevich black squares, an \u201cunattainable absolute\u201d.\n\nWhen he performed it in Hobart (as part of MONA's Dark Mofo festival in June), the audience were in a separate room, watching on video screens. \u201cThe same elusiveness that\u2019s propelling me, never being able to arrive at this transcendence, is recapitulated in the audience\u2019s experience of the work. They\u2019re not actually there. Experiencing it on video, that delay, all of that constituted the work.\u201d\n\nSelf-reflexive loops, recreations and repeats of past works \u2013 a certain hall-of-mirrors quality \u2013are features of Parr\u2019s practice. They build the idea that everything he does is part of a single great, ongoing artwork, a claim that irritates McDonald. \u201cThis would make it virtually criticism-proof because one cannot hope to see more than a little at a time,\u201d he says.\n\nFor Left Field [for Robert Hunter] a life-sized copy of a gallery is being built in Carriageworks' Bay 21. \u201cWhat happens to the audience is that they walk in this huge gallery and they realise that I\u2019m exhibiting Anna Schwartz\u2019s gallery in Melbourne in her ex-gallery space here in Sydney,\u201d says Parr (Schwartz was based at Carriageworks for eight years).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlaying on repeat will be video of his 2017 opening night at Anna Schwartz Melbourne where he laboriously painted the white walls white. Audio of the event plays over, notably the sound of the crowd, reverential and silent at first but breaking out into chat and conviviality as the night wears on. Does Parr mind that their attention wandered? \u201cThere\u2019s something endearing about that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the human dimension.\u201d\n\nLeft Field is an elegy to a friend, the late Robert Hunter, whom he last saw painting pale canvases in a bright sunroom. The video of Parr painting the walls, poetically filmed by his regular collaborator Gotaro Uematsu, focuses on \u201cdiamante edges\u201d of refracted light as Parr applies the wet paint \u2013 a memory of something that caught his eye as he watched Hunter work that last time.\n\nLeft Field [for Robert Hunter] sees Parr painting the white walls of the Anna Schwartz Gallery white. Zan Wimberley\n\nParr\u2019s third work, Burning Down The House, captures a previous performance at Carriageworks where he set fire to a pile of his prints, the video also made by Uematsu. A fourth event, a closed performance for which the audience needs to register online to attend, will take place at 1am on November 16.\n\nAudiences often surprise Parr. After Towards a Black Square in Hobart this year he was praised for the \u201celegant placement\u201d of the dripping, rough-edged patches he had painted in the dark: the aspect that was the least within his control.\n\nAfter spending 72 hours inside a steel box under a Hobart intersection for MONA\u2019s Dark Mofo Festival in 2018, Parr was struck by the words of an Aboriginal elder: \u201cHe said, \u2018This is not some kind of Anglo erection of a notable figure in bronze on a plinth. This is an anti-memorial. This is the oblivion. This is the genocide, this is about us.\u2019 So I said, 'Wonderful.'\u201d\n\nSo what is Mike Parr, then, if not the controller of this artistic enterprise?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the person that just \u2026 I dispose the signifier. I allocate the signs. I have a clear idea, I think, of what is the potential of the situation, what its potential meanings are. But I think it\u2019s much more important for the audience to discover those meanings.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cinevitable random fact at the base of abstract art,\u201d says Parr, is \u201cit truly works when it\u2019s absolutely on the edge of incoherence.\n\n\u201cThere is no manual.\u201d\n\nMike Parr: The Eternal Opening, Carriageworks, 245 Wilson Street, Everleigh, Sydney from October 25-December 8.", "description": "The 74-year-old's work has been pilloried, puzzled over and applauded for nearly 50 years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2764%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_533%2C$y_75/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1b700221055399c0a4a7d58672f1719e06111d3b", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
