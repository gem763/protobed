The painting was sold to an anonymous buyer near Chantilly, North of Paris, by Dominique Le Coent of Acteon Auction House.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a painting that was unique, splendid and monumental. Cimabue was the father of the Renaissance. But this sale goes beyond all our dreams,\u201d Le Coent told Associated Press. The painting is called the \u2018Christ Mocked\u2019 and it measures about 10 inches by 8 inches.\n\nAP\n\nDon't Miss 54.1 K SHARES 26.5 K SHARES 22.5 K SHARES 9.6 K SHARES 11.4 K SHARES\n\nAfter an auctioneer spotted the painting in the woman\u2019s house during inspection, he told her to bring it to the experts for evaluation. The painting was hung on the wall between the kitchen and dining room. The auction house said that the woman will get maximum amount of money from the sale.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a Cimabue painting on sale so there was no reference previously on how much it could make,\u201d Le Coent explained.\n\nAlso known as Cenni di Pepo or Cenni di Pepi, Cimabue was an Italian painter. He is generally regarded as one of the first great Italian painters to break from the Italo-Byzantine style.\n\nYou might want to scan your house for any hidden treasures you might have lying around.", "description": "What if you find something in your house that will make you earn Rs 18.8 crore?
