She is one of only nine at the DLC and 25 in the entire country, SWNS added.\n\n'OMEN OF EVIL' BABY AYE-AYE LIVES IN DENVER ZOO\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not at all aggressive, they\u2019re extremely curious and energetic and they\u2019re very intelligent \u2014 they learn very quickly,\" DLC curator Cathy Williams said in comments reported by SWNS.\n\nMelisandre will be with her mother, Ardrey, for approximately two to three years while she learns to fend for herself, including looking for food, building a nest and other survival skills.\n\nAccording to the DLC, aye-ayes have strange feeding habits, causing them to be \"considered by many to be the strangest primate in the world.\"\n\nTheir diet largely consists of Ramy nuts, nectar from Traveller's Palm Tree, fungi and insect grubs.\n\n\"The animals are also known to raid coconut plantations, and have been seen eating lychees and mangoes, which are also plantation crops,\" the DLC added on its website.\n\nNatives to Madagascar, aye-ayes are considered symbolic of death there and even considered an omen of evil. The aye-aye was thought to be extinct but was rediscovered in 1961, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).\n\nIn 2018, a baby aye-aye named Tonks was born at the Denver Zoo to parents Bellatrix and Smeagol.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "A baby aye-aye, also known as a long-fingered lemur, has been born at the Duke Lemur Centre (DLC) in North Carolina, SWNS reports.", "authors": ["Chris Ciaccia"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/baby-aye-aye-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
