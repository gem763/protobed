They could take power as a minority government or pursue alliances with other left-of-center parties to pass legislation \u2014 as they did in their last term with the Portuguese Communist Party and the radical Left Bloc.\n\nAntonio Costa, the Socialist leader and incumbent prime minister, said he would start talks with other parties with the aim of securing a political agreement for the next four years.\n\n\"Political stability is essential for Portugal's international credibility,\" Costa said in a victory speech.\n\nHe said his prospective government will continue its efforts to improve debt-heavy Portugal's public finances \u2014 a key achievement in his first term that endeared him to the Portuguese and to other European leaders keen to avoid a repeat of the continent's recent financial crisis.\n\nAs other Socialist parties have lost ground across Europe in recent years, Costa's administration won respect by proving wrong the doubters who said it would overspend.\n\nThe Left Bloc, which had won 19 seats in the incomplete count, said it was ready to open negotiations with the Socialists on a government program.\n\nThe Portuguese Communist Party had 10 seats and the Christian Democrats five.\n\nSmall fringe parties also picked up a handful of seats, and some of them could be targets for the government to recruit support in parliament.\n\nCosta took power four years ago on a promise to undo austerity measures introduced during Europe's financial crisis, when Portugal needed an international bailout.\n\nNow his Socialists reaped the rewards of Portugal's economic rebound in recent years. Annual growth climbed from 0.2% in 2014 to 2.1% in 2018, and unemployment dropped by around half, to 6%, over that period.\n\nThe budget deficit \u2014 long a torment for Portugal as governments routinely overspent \u2014 is now close to zero under the financial stewardship of Finance Minister Mario Centeno, who also chairs the meetings of finance ministers from the 19 European nations that used the shared euro currency.\n\nCenteno is expected to continue in the post.\n\nThe Social Democrats are still associated in the public mind with deep cutbacks and a three-year recession that ended in 2014, when they were in government. Also, party leader Rui Rio has struggled to contain disagreements between factions of his party.\n\nPortugal hasn't witnessed the rise of populist or far-right parties which have risen to prominence elsewhere in the EU. Protests in Portugal are traditionally channeled into a low turnout \u2014 only about half the country's 10.8 million eligible voters cast their ballot.\n\nThe next government faces plenty of challenges, including the United Kingdom's impending departure from the EU. The U.K. is one of Portugal's main export markets.\n\nWhile government spending is now more in line with revenues, Portugal's government debt is equivalent to more than 120% of gross domestic product \u2014 the third highest in the EU. And the combined government, private and corporate debt is more than three times the country's GDP, the Bank of Portugal says. If European interest rates rise, the Portuguese could find themselves in big trouble.\n\nOther challenges include climate change, as rainfall in the southern half of the country dwindles, and an aging population that threatens the financing of the welfare system. The EU says that at current fertility rates the number of Portuguese will decline from 10.3 million this year to 6.6 million in 2100.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
