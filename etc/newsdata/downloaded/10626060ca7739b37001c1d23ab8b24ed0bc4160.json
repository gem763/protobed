Plastic also dominated the waste found below the surface, including on the seabed.\n\nEarlier this year, Beijing published an action plan designed to clean up the Bohai Bay, one of the country's busiest and most polluted waterways.\n\nChina has earmarked 7 billion yuan ($991.70 million) for the clean-up this year alone, but Huo said it is still expected to struggle to meet a key target aimed at making at least 73% of Bohai waters fit for human contact by next year, up from around 70% at present.\n\nChina is planning to make around 30% of its coastal waters completely off-limits to development as part of a national \"ecological red line\" scheme.\n\nBut it is also trying to protect its rivers and improve the environment of its cities by moving polluting industries like steel and petrochemicals to the coast.", "description": "China's ocean waste surges 27% in 2018: ministry", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9S09R-OCATP_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
