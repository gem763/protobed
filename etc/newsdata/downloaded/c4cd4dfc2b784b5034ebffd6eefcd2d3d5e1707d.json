That's no joke. It's dangerous rhetoric", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE\n\nThe notion of shooting foreigners to keep them from reaching the U.S. border is appalling. Donald Trump should've condemned it. Who will call it out?\n\nPresident Donald Trump talks with reporters as he tours a section of the southern border wall, Wednesday, Sept. 18, 2019, in Otay Mesa, Calif., as acting Homeland Secretary Kevin McAleenan listens, (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\nPresident Donald Trump's response to anonymous reports is leaving no doubt that shooting immigrants in the leg to keep them out of this country is fair game, and that\u2019s dangerous.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump denied on Twitter that he wanted a \u201cmoat stuffed with alligators and snakes, with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top.\u201d\n\n\u201cI may be tough on Border Security, but not that tough,\u201d he tweeted, attacking The New York Times report.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t rebuff other New York Times anonymous reports that he suggested shooting immigrants in the leg to slow them down in his zealous efforts to seal the southern border to all foreigners.\n\nNow the press is trying to sell the fact that I wanted a Moat stuffed with alligators and snakes, with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top, at our Southern Border. I may be tough on Border Security, but not that tough. The press has gone Crazy. Fake News! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2019\n\nEl Paso is proof: Violent words matter\n\nThe Times detailed a March meeting where Trump suggested firing at immigrants and called for a \u201cwater-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators\u201d and a \u201cwall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh.\u201d\n\nDoes that sound Trumpian? Of course it does, and everyone knows it. From the get-go, Trump has had no qualms in dishing out violent imagery, telling the world in 2016 that he could even shoot somebody and not lose votes.\n\nAnd now we know he would try to do just that. Not himself, of course, and the target isn't a man in New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue, as he had voiced on the campaign trail.\n\nWhy deterrence won't work: Asylum seekers I meet flee something even worse than Trump's unethical immigration agenda\n\nThe mere notion of shooting foreigners to keep them from reaching the U.S. border is appalling, irresponsible and dangerous.\n\nOn Aug. 3, Patrick Crusius, a 21-year old white man, opened fire in a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, killing 22 and injuring more than two dozen others.\n\nIn his 2,300-word manifesto, Crusius talked about the \u201cHispanic invasion of Texas.\u201d Simply put, he drove hundreds of miles from his home outside Dallas to hunt down Hispanics. Thirteen of the victims were U.S. citizens, eight were Mexican citizens and one was a German national.\n\nWhy would anyone want to shoot foreigners?\n\nTrump isn't responsible for that faithful August day in El Paso. But it is clear his anti-Mexican rhetoric is part of this moment. Why would anyone be OK with this?\n\nFollow the law until you change it: Congress must be unafraid to follow the immigration laws we wrote\n\nAnd why would anyone be OK with the notion of shooting immigrants in the leg? Trump aides reportedly kept him from all this craziness, resorting instead to strong-arm Mexico into military intervention within its territory to curb the flow of Central American asylum seekers from reaching U.S. soil.\n\nAmerica seems to be shrugging off Trump\u2019s violent mindset against immigrants as nothing more than tantrums. But that\u2019s a mistake and the massacre in El Paso proves it.\n\nI get that the country is consumed with Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry in the U.S. House of Representatives over his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden.\n\nBut Trump needs to be called out. The country needs to know that shooting foreigners \u2014 in the leg or anywhere else \u2014 is illegal and immoral.\n\nElvia D\u00edaz is an editorial columnist for The Republic and azcentral, where this column originally appeared.
