Still, he projects that the economy will grow above-trend in 2019, lifted by a tight labor market with an unemployment rate at 3.5%.\n\n\"There are lots of reasons to be optimistic about this economy,\" Bostic said. \"But also we need to recognize that there's a lot of uncertainty out there.\"\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday there is a \"very good chance\" of a trade deal with China emerging from next week's scheduled talks, though he has made similar pronouncements ahead of past negotiations.\n\n\n\n\n\nKEEPING AN OPEN MIND\n\nBostic's counterpart at the Boston Fed, Eric Rosengren, who opposed the central bank's two rate cuts this year, said he too was parsing the data, and had an \"open mind\" on policy ahead.\n\nU.S. employment growth is getting to what he \"would expect in kind of a stable economy,\" Rosengren told CNBC in an interview. \"I think the bigger question is whether it ends up being weaker from here and that depends importantly on what happens on the consumer side of the economy.\"\n\nThe Labor Department report Friday showed the unemployment rate fell to 3.5% last month as U.S. employers added 136,000 jobs, down from 168,000 jobs created in August but still plenty to keep up with labor market growth.\n\nCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, interviewed later in the day on CNBC, said that so far she is not seeing signs that weakness in manufacturing is spilling over to consumer spending, which has been strong and accounts for about 70% of the U.S. economy.\n\nStill, she said, trade spats and slowing global growth are a headwind on U.S. exports and that she takes those risks seriously.\n\nAsked whether she would support a rate cut if she had to decide today, Mester took issue with the very question.\n\n\"I don't have to say today,\" she said. \"In fact, I really think it's important that we really look at the incoming information that we are going to get as we work up to the end-of-the month meeting.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n(With reporing by Jonnelle Marte in New York; Additional reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Lucia Mutikani, Editing Chizu Nomiyama, Andrea Ricci and Sandra Maler)", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO/ WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve policymakers on Friday signaled they are on high alert for signs that uncertainty over trade policy and slowing global growth are beginning to hold back the broader U.S. economy, but so far they have flagged little in the data that is pointing one", "authors": ["Ann Saphir", "Lindsay Dunsmuir"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fWOx8LnhTt9Ixau.JPYEKw--~B/aD0yOTk7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/1abc4cc06c8b060aabaf6cd579a5eda3", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
