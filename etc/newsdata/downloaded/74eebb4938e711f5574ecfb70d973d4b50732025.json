They included the usual suspects of the political war roll call, including Trump himself (he was top of the list, of course, at $718,000), Democratic presidential candidates Tom Steyer and Elizabeth Warren, and both the National Republican Congressional Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\n\n[Trump\u2019s latest tariffs could mean higher food and drink prices \u2014 and not just for French wine]\n\nBut one name jumped off the screen for its sheer one-of-these-things-is-not-like-the-other factor: Penzeys Spices, the nation\u2019s largest spice retailer, had dropped $92,000 from Sept. 29 to Oct. 5 on ads championing impeachment. That was more than self-funding millionaire Steyer, more than hard-charging Warren \u2014 more than anyone else other than Trump.\n\nWhich of course had some people wondering: What\u2019s a company known for hawking spot-on cinnamon blends doing in the political trenches?\n\nFor many Penzeys fans, it comes as no surprise. The company has a history of unabashed liberal activism. Its founder, Bill Penzey, greeted Trump\u2019s election with an email calling the president an \u201copenly racist candidate.\u201d As Helen Rosner noted in a New Yorker story last year, that set him far apart from the rest of the business-leader pack. He was \u201cquite possibly the first to publicly call Trump\u2019s election an \u2018embrace of racism,\u2019\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd he was definitely the first to do so while hawking a free bottle of Quebec Seasonings with any five-dollar purchase.\u201d\n\nPenzey writes a regular email newsletter to customers that weaves the typical stuff of corporate communications \u2014 product giveaways, recipe links \u2014 with messages about topics such as the Mueller investigation, immigration and Supreme Court nominees. And since Trump\u2019s election, his by turns earnest-and-funny missives have targeted the commander in chief.\n\nThe company\u2019s impeachment ad, which ran last week, wasn\u2019t the blunt-force entreaty of most political ads. Instead, it was a 1,592-word message from Penzey celebrating what he called a good week for democracy. \u201cYou may not have been paying much attention this week, but the short version is the end is very near for this terrible turn the Republican Party has taken,\u201d he wrote. In typical form, Penzey leavened his narrative with gentle humor: \u201cIf liberals have to fix this on their own, they can and will, but it would be awesome to have conservatives pitching in alongside,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou guys are hard workers, plus you always bring those cakes we like.\u201d\n\nBecause somebody needs to say this:It\u2019s the end of the Republican Party as we know it\u2014And we should all feel fine\u2026 Posted by Penzeys Spices on Thursday, October 3, 2019\n\nIn a telephone interview, Penzey said he was a little surprised to learn of the distinction he had earned by being the second-biggest spender on impeachment ads. That\u2019s partly because he says he doesn\u2019t see what he\u2019s putting out there to be purely politically motivated. \u201cI\u2019m running ads to run a business,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd so much of that is using your business to radiate your values.\u201d\n\nThe ad mentioning impeachment, he says, has performed twice as well as any other ad he\u2019s run.\n\nPenzey has publicly addressed his strategy of all-in political engagement, something most big companies eschew for fear of turning off half their potential customer base.\n\n[How to organize your spices so that you\u2019ll actually use them before they fade]\n\nLast month, he called on chief executives to rethink the idea that getting political is bad for business. \u201cFrom education, to equality, to health care to virtually every other issue the republicans are standing for the wealthiest of the wealthy and against We the People,\u201d he wrote in an email that was also included in a Facebook ad. \u201cIf your business relies on We the People it is time to give serious thought to standing up for them.\u201d\n\nHe also suggested that businesses that sit out political battles could lose out to competitors who get into the fray. \u201cNo loyalty you or any others in your field have built up means anything compared to standing with the people in next year\u2019s election,\u201d he wrote in the same ad. \u201cMy advice is to figure out who you want to be and be it in a big way.\u201d\n\nIn the interview he says he isn\u2019t afraid to disagree with potential customers, though he hopes that even people who don\u2019t agree with his politics could still like his products: \u201cJust because you have bad taste in politics, why should you have bad-tasting food?\u201d\n\nMore from Food:\n\nBrad Pitt is \u2018the Laurence Olivier of eating\u2019 on screen.
