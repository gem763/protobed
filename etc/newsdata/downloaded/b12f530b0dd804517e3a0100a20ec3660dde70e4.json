After-hours, they\u2019ll need to brave the challenge alone.\n\n\u201cWell, not exactly alone, some of our Fright Fest ghouls will be lurking about in the darkness,\u201d the event\u2019s webpage states.\n\nContestants will also be prohibited from removing the lids of their coffins unless it's during designated meal or bathroom breaks. There will also be challenges during the 30-hour period, which may include \u201csticking hand in a bucket and finding a specified item,\" \u201claying in a coffin covered in worms,\" or \u201cgoing into haunted house alone and finding a specified prop.\u201d\n\nOh, and there\u2019s \u201cNO TECHNOLOGY ALLOWED\u201d \u2014 e.g. phones, tablets or smartwatches \u2014 inside the coffins.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nAny couple who fails to follow the rules or complete the challenges be disqualified. Participants can also opt out at any time, forfeiting their chance at winning.\n\nThe winners of the challenge \u2014 dubbed the \u201c30-Hour COUPLES Coffin Challenge\u201d \u2014 will be rewarded with $600 cash to split however they please, two Gold Season Passes for 2020 (which also work for this year\u2019s Fright Fest and Holiday in the Park festivities) and two Express Haunted House passes.\n\nIf more than one couple remains at the end of the 30 hours, \u201cthe remaining finalists will compete head-to-head with a spicy hot sauce sandwhich [sic] eating contest,\u201d according to the official rules. The contestant to finish the sandwich the fastest will take home the grand prize.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe challenge is scheduled to begin 4 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 27 and last until 10 p.m. on Sept. 28. Anyone interested in competing can sign up for one of the six spots at SixFlags.com through Sept. 20. The chosen six contestants will be notified the following day, leaving them just under a week to both secure a partner and prepare their bladders for the three-hour stretches between bathroom breaks.", "description": "Well if this doesn\u2019t qualify as fun family entertainment, we don\u2019t know what does.", "authors": ["Michael Bartiromo"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/CoffinIstock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
