We don\u2019t know who will get the blame for the current political deadlock, or who will benefit.\n\n\u201cBut we do expect there to be clear winners and losers because voters are now more changeable in response to such shock events. A key driver of vote choice will be how competent each party is perceived to be on Brexit.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s push for a general election at the earliest available opportunity is in danger of backfiring, a major study has indicated.
