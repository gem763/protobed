(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Top U.S. diplomats encouraged Ukraine\u2019s newly elected president to conduct an investigation linked to Joe Biden\u2019s family in return for a high-profile visit to Washington with President Donald Trump. It soon escalated into what one feared was a \"crazy\" swap that risked vital U.S. military aid.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a cache of text messages released late Thursday by House investigators following a 10-hour interview with one of the diplomats, Kurt Volker, who stepped down as special envoy to Ukraine amid the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe pages lay out the raw contours of a potential quid-pro-quo exchange \u2014 Trump gets his political investigation of a top Democratic rival in return for some price to be paid by the new Ukraine leader \u2014 now at the heart of the House investigation.\n\nThe text messages convey a distinct campaign among the three diplomats, who \u2014 apparently against some of their stated better judgment \u2014 appear to be trying to help Ukraine reset its relationship with Trump by pushing his interest in investigating his Democratic rival and the 2016 election.\n\nVolker, in a text message on the morning of a planned July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, wrote: \u201cHeard from White House \u2014 Assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / \"get to the bottom of what happened\" in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington.\u201d\n\nAn adviser to the Ukrainian president appeared to go along with the proposal, which entailed investigating Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company where Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter served on the board.\n\n\u201cPhone call went well,\u201d wrote Andrey Yermak in a text to Volker later that day after the two presidents spoke. Yermak suggested several dates when Trump and Zerenskiy could meet in September.\n\nBut all that planning started to unravel when Zelenskiy\u2019s aide tried to lock in a date for the Trump meeting before putting out the statement on the investigations.\n\n\u201cOnce we have a date we will call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of US-UKRAINE relationship , including among other things Burisma and election meddling in investigations,\u201d Yermak wrote two weeks later.\n\n\u201cSounds great!\u201d texted Volker.\n\nVolker and the two other diplomats _ William \u201cBill\u201d Taylor, the charge d\u2019affaires at the U.S. embassy in Ukraine, and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union _ discussed the statement Zelenskiy would issue in support of the investigation. As the negotiations progressed, Sondland said Trump \"really wants the deliverable.\"\n\nThen, Trump put a hold on $250 million in military assistance to Ukraine, which was depending on the funds as part of its defense against Russia.\n\n\u201cNeed to talk with you,\u201d Yermak wrote to Volker.\n\nTaylor, the seasoned top diplomat in the Ukrainian embassy, conveyed his concerns and questioned whether the money was being withheld until Ukraine agreed to Trump\u2019s demand.\n\n\u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThis is my nightmare scenario,\u201d Taylor texted his colleagues days later. Taylor said that by withholding the Ukrainian assistance, \u201cwe have already shaken their faith in us.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats launched the impeachment inquiry over the Ukraine matter after a government whistleblower disclosed Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy and the push to have a foreign government interfere in U.S. elections by digging up dirt on Biden.\n\nAs a Democratic front-runner, Biden could be Trump\u2019s opponent in the 2020 presidential election. Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani have tried, without evidence, to implicate Biden and his son Hunter in the kind of corruption that has long plagued Ukraine.\n\nHunter Biden served on the board of Burisma at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration\u2019s diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son.\n\nTrump and Giuliani have also promoted an alternative theory of 2016 election interference, which puts Ukraine, not Russia, at the center, at odds with the 2017 findings of the U.S. intelligence community and special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s 2019 report.", "description": "Top U.S. diplomats encouraged Ukraine\u2019s newly elected president to conduct an investigation linked to Joe Biden\u2019s family in return for a high-profile visit to Washington with President Donald Trump.
