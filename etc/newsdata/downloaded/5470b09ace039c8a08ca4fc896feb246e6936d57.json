It didn\u2019t say how the younger Bin Laden was killed. It didn\u2019t say when. It didn\u2019t say where, apart from \u201cthe Afghanistan/Pakistan region.\u201d\n\nAlthough it\u2019s conceivable that it took until now for forensic scientists working on whatever was left of Hamza to confirm his DNA (they presumably have his father\u2019s on file), the timing raises questions about the administration\u2019s larger foreign policy, mainly whether the president\u2019s tough guy credentials can actually coexist with an approach that\u2019s been incoherent and, fundamentally, weak.", "description": "From Saudi Arabia to Afghanistan and North Korea, Trump\u2019s tough guy credentials are being tested big time by the world of troubles he has helped to create.", "authors": ["Christopher Dickey", "World News Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2915,w_5184,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568496103/RTX72W12_vd8ur0", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
