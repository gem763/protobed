That\u2019s basically a lifetime in the land of showbiz where 72-day marriages are pretty much the norm.\n\nThe happy couple tied the knot in 1988 but have been together a total of 37 years, making them one of the longest-lasting celebrity couples.\n\nIt\u2019s been quite a ride for the couple as they\u2019ve weathered the normal ups and downs of successful careers and family life.\n\nShirlie, 57, is best known as a member of \u201880s pop duo Pepsi and Shirlie, and as a singer for Wham! alongside George Michael, while Martin, 58, was a star of EastEnders and a member of Spandau Ballet.\n\nThe couple are also parents to daughter Harley, 30, and son Roman, 26.\n\nNow, Martin and Shirlie can add collaborators to that list as they\u2019re set to release their first joint album together, In The Swing Of It, next month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost of us can only dream of achieving long-lasting love with a significant other but Martin and Shirlie have somehow made it work.\n\nMartin and Shirlie have been married almost 40 years (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nBut would they have been able to stick it out if they met in the ever fickle era of dating apps like Tinder and Hinge?\n\n\u2018I really do feel sorry for kids nowadays, maybe even more so girls, because you know that your boyfriend has all this access to seeing millions of girls on his phone,\u2019 Shirlie told Metro.co.uk.\n\nI mean, that didn\u2019t exist in my day. So I think there\u2019s so much pressure on young people now.\u2019\n\nA sign of their true love, Shirlie believes she and Martin would have always found each other even with all the options dating apps bring.\n\n\u2018Martin and I didn\u2019t even have phones in those days, we had postcards,\u2019 she recalled. \u2018And we survived that so we could have survived anything because I think if you love someone, you love someone, and you get through it. So yeah, I\u2019m sure we would survive today.\u2019\n\nAw, you guys.\n\nWhen it comes to the secret of what keeps their relationship strong against the odds, Shirlie said: \u2018People always say what\u2019s the secret to your relationship? I think this album is the secret. I think all the songs reveal it.\u2019\n\nTheir forthcoming album, In The Swing Of It, is pretty much their love letters to each other \u2013 that we can all share and enjoy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCovers of classic songs include Fly Me To The Moon, Ain\u2019t That a Kick In The Head, the lead single Nice Work If You Can Get It and, Martin\u2019s favourite, The Way You Look Tonight.\n\n\u2018I always like the song The Way You Look Tonight, because there\u2019s a line it says when you when you \u201claugh, the wrinkle, it wrinkles, your nose\u201d, and Shirlie actually has that line when she laughs and it wrinkles, so that one hits home,\u2019 Martin said fondly.\n\nCan these two be more adorable?\n\nLoving their almost matching looks (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nThey\u2019ve barely aged a day (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nAlmost 40 years and still going strong (Picture: WireImage)\n\nThe album has even more of a person touch as their daughter Harley actually wrote two songs for the record, Like We Used To Do and When We\u2019re Apart.\n\nShirlie said of her daughter\u2019s contribution: \u2018They melt my heart because of the lyrics because it\u2019s her looking at her parents. The lyrics are so charming.\u2019\n\n\u2018It was lovely when she came up with the songs because it was her take on mum and dad\u2019s relationship at this point in our lives, which was lovely to hear. It was emotional,\u2019 Martin added.\n\nThe couple have even recorded a Christmas cover of It\u2019s Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas, and while it\u2019s Shirlie\u2019s favourite time of year, they\u2019re not hedging their bets on scooping this year\u2019s Christmas number one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShirlie admitted: \u2018I will try and visualise it but I don\u2019t want to disappoint myself.\u2019\n\nWe reckon they could Michael Buble and Robbie Williams a good run for their money.\n\nMartin and Shirlie\u2019s debut album In The Swing Of It is set for release on 22 November.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
