It\u2019s a special event. He should be at it.\u201d\n\nTrump will not throw out the first pitch at Game 5, a decision Lerner said the Nationals made. Before Game 3, Chad Cordero threw out the first pitch to Brian Schneider, a reunion of the battery from 2005, the year baseball returned to Washington. The Nationals scheduled a member of the Nationals Youth Baseball Academy to do the honors before Game 4. And before Game 5, the Nationals tabbed local chef and philanthropist Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, a vocal Trump critic.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe first pitches are our call, and we felt there are many other candidates that should be considered before [Trump],\u201d Lerner said. \u201cThe 2005 guys will be awesome tonight. Our scholar from the baseball academy tomorrow night. Jose, who I think is being considered for a Nobel Peace Prize. That's three pretty good selections. We just wanted to have the right people. I think we got a nice mix of people.\u201d\n\nLerner said Trump will sit among league officials as opposed to Nationals executives.\n\nMLB Commissioner Rob Manfred insisted the league spoke with Trump regarding a ceremonial first pitch, and that Trump declined in order to ease the flow of fans entering the park. Trump will arrive after Game 5 begins, according to Manfred.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe actually had a conversation with him about first pitches,\u201d Manfred told reporters. \u201cHis view was that in order to make the fan experience as positive as possible, he would arrive at Game 5 sometime after the game began so it wouldn\u2019t interfere with fans getting into the stadium. Quite frankly, we were very grateful for that. We thought it was a great decision on the President\u2019s part.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump demurred Thursday when asked if he would throw out a first pitch. \u201cI don't know,\u201d he said. \u201cThey gotta dress me up in a lot of heavy armor. I'll look too heavy. I don't like that.\u201d\n\nBefore Opening Day in 2017, Trump declined the Nationals\u2019 invitation to throw out the first pitch, and he has not attended Nationals Park as president. Both President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, the only other presidents during the Nationals\u2019 existence, threw out first pitches at Nationals games during their administrations.\n\nAD\n\nRead more World Series coverage:\n\nAD", "description": "Washington's principal owner discussed the president's plans to attend Game 5 before the Nats hosted the Astros Friday night.", "authors": ["Adam Kilgore", "Reporter Covering National Sports"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4czBWReW3z0AW8BxvsdyAXiSN1o=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P5OY7KHXR4I6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
