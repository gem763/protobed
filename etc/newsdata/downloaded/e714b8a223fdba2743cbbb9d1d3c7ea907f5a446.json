In all, 150 guests celebrated with the happy couple.\n\nHowever, the guest list isn't what's making the news -- it's the food the happy couple served up during their fantastic reception.\n\nBeyond trays of smoked fish and beef roasting on open fire spits, there were also two food trucks there: Boston's Baddest Burger and Sandwich Company.\n\nThe owner of Boston's Baddest Burger Food Truck revealed he had no idea he was catering the event for such a famous client.
