The windows of her studio and bedroom look down on the courtyard and facade of the British Museum. All the world and its history, in every available London light, is just across the street. Paul has lived and painted here \u2013 the two things are inseparable in her mind \u2013 since 1982, when she discovered this place with Lucian Freud, her then lover and the father of her only child, Frank, also a painter.\n\n\u201cWhen we first came to look,\u201d she recalls, \u201cthe entrance was at the back and the place seemed a bit dingy. It had been bedsits and there were gas fires where you put coins in the meter, but then we came in here and saw these windows and we were just overwhelmed. Lucian put down the cash deposit immediately.\u201d\n\nWith Lucian there was always this element of control\n\nPaul, now 58, rented the flat for a couple of years before the landlord offered it for sale. Freud bought it for her for \u00a375,000, \u201cwhich seemed such an incredible lot of money at the time\u201d. It has not changed much in all the time since. There are bare boards on the floor; she points out an old leak in one corner of the ceiling. The studio is empty except for her easel and piles of discarded paint tubes and rags and a mirror, from which Paul constructs her haunting and soulful self-portraits. The only furniture in the adjoining living room is a battered chaise longue and a chair that is smeared, like much else, with paint. There is a single iron-framed bed in one corner. Paul, whose father was the bishop of Bradford, is married to Steven Kupfer, a teacher of philosophy, but they have always kept separate homes. What faith she has herself, she expresses on canvas.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lucian and Me, 2019, an image from Celia Paul\u2019s upcoming show at Victoria Miro.

She has struggled her whole life with the terrors of small talk. Her self-containment, her vivid and protected world of interiors, is what gives her painting its enormous affective power. Paul describes herself as an autobiographer rather than a portrait painter by which she means she paints mostly herself and those she loves \u2013 her four sisters, her late mother, her husband, her son. Each of those singular figures emerge in her work as if from a private netherworld of thoughtful and anxious attention. For a while the family lived near Haworth, and the Bront\u00ebs have been touchstones for all of the sisters. They have each lost count of the number of times they have read Jane Eyre. Something of the ghost of that association animates a poetic, sometimes painfully honest memoir that Paul has written, which is the occasion for our interview.\n\nBefore we sit down to talk she shows me the new paintings that she plans to include in an imminent exhibition of her work at the Victoria Miro gallery in London, which will open at the same time as her book appears. Paul has lately been granted her due as a soft-spoken star of British figurative art, \u201can artist like no other\u201d according to the New Yorker. She hoists her new canvases, which have their backs to the room, one by one to her easel, while offering a commentary about how vulnerable it feels to show work in this way.\n\nThe paintings each infuse the room with curious light, and put a pin in the map of Paul\u2019s life. First up is a meditative seascape that she painted on a recent foray out to Los Angeles for an exhibition of her work. \u201cI dreaded going because I never go anywhere\u2026\u201d she says, \u201cbut the ocean proved inspiring.\u201d The light and the vegetation stirred memories of her very early childhood in India, where her father worked as a missionary. \u201cAnd that made me wonder about my dread of going away\u2026\u201d\n\nIs the dread about the travel, the flying?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t mind flying but I suffer from homesickness terribly. I can\u2019t stop thinking about getting back to my space here.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Celia Paul, 1976. Photograph: image courtesy Celia Paul\n\nThat space is then occupied with an ethereal picture of her younger sister Kate, a writer and former actress, who became her most frequent sitter after their mother, at 80, was unable any longer to negotiate the stairs.\n\nIn her book, Kate emerges as Paul\u2019s first confidante and soulmate, the sounding board for the fears and excitements of her involvement with Freud, whom she met, aged 18 when she was his student at the Slade School of Fine Art. Freud was then 55. They became lovers almost immediately, maintained a relationship for nearly a decade and a complicated intimacy that lasted until Freud\u2019s death in 2011.\n\nThe relationship has led to Paul being routinely identified as another entry in Freud\u2019s extensive catalogue of lovers and subjects \u2013 she sat for several portraits \u2013 rather than as a formidable artist herself. She sees her book, and her self-portraits, as hard-won acts of liberation and defiance at that characterisation.\n\n\u201cWhen Lucian died I was shocked by how I was seen in the world,\u201d she says. \u201cI was \u2018Lucian Freud\u2019s muse\u2019. I felt I needed to do something about this. I thought the way to do that would be to make this story my own.\u201d\n\nShe shows me another portrait, this one of her husband, Steven Kupfer, a tender painting that wants to bristle with its subject\u2019s quickness of mind.\n\nShe pauses before it. \u201cSteven is very ill,\u201d she says. \u201cThough he does not look it. He has had bowel cancer and now he has liver cancer. I painted this in May. He is having chemo still and tests for which we always hold our breath. Psychologically he is very strong, reading madly, thinking about the transcendental ego. His morale is tremendously good.\u201d When Paul smiles, she becomes a different person, suddenly girlish. \u201cHe used to think about philosophy when he sat for me,\u201d she says, \u201cbut he often used to fall asleep. So now he memorises cryptic crossword clues before he comes and solves them in his head.\u201d\n\nKupfer, 78, lives in Kentish Town, a couple of miles north from here. I wonder how their marriage works \u2013 was it never their plan to live together?\n\nShe says that from the beginning \u2013 they married in 2011 \u2013 she made it clear that she needed this private space and he was OK with that. \u201cHe had lived with people before, but he took to the idea. We go out to supper with each other several times a week,\u201d she says, \u201cand he rings me punctually every day at 3pm and at 9pm. He is clockwork reliable. Compared to Lucian [who would keep her waiting long hours and days and weeks for promised contact], \u201chaving that support is extraordinarily confidence giving.\u201d\n\nHer memoir begins pointedly with the moment she met Freud \u2013 he in a perfectly tailored grey wool suit, with a white silk scarf, smoking a Gitane \u2013 on one of her first days at art college, fresh from her girls\u2019 boarding school in Devon. The first half of what follows mines her old diaries and letters and poems to reconstruct the love and longing and frequent despair that the affair caused her. Some scenes are hard to read \u2013 Paul\u2019s account of Freud\u2019s initial forceful physical advances; his insistence that she lie naked for him to paint, imposing an acute vulnerability that made her cry; the one-sided demands and frequent betrayals \u2013 and the more so because they are rendered in her original youthful voice.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Painter and Model, 2012, by Celia Paul. Photograph: \u00a9 Celia Paul, courtesy the artist and Victoria Miro, London / Venice\n\nHer story emerges from those beginnings, however, to tell a different tale, one that celebrates family and persistent female power. In Freud\u2019s last painting of Paul, she stands fully clothed in this studio, her foot on a tube of paint, with a naked male model, her friend Angus Cook, sprawled on the chaise. Freud seemed to be marking a change in her, a suggestion that she was ready to transition from passive muse to active artist. She is not sure she needed his permission.\n\nHer own work subsequently dwelt on just those tensions. Her best-known self-portrait, Painter and Model (2012), was a large-scale intensely layered depiction of herself sitting in a painting smock; the painting was a scene stealer in the 2016 Tate Britain survey of post-war British painting, All Too Human, alongside the headline acts, Freud and Francis Bacon. The last two new paintings she shows me in her studio, are both new images of herself, now tentatively standing.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started doing self-portraits \u2013 and I didn\u2019t start until I was in my 40s, quite late \u2013 I did these portraits where my hand was kind of stretched out toward the canvas, as if about to paint,\u201d she says. \u201cI suppose I was imitating those famous poses of Goya or Rembrandt. But something felt so false about that. Somehow women don\u2019t have a secure place in the history of art and to portray myself in this way standing squarely, about to paint, it wasn\u2019t right.\u201d\n\nThe new paintings have been inspired in part by the connection she felt to Paula Rego\u2019s recent exhibition, Obedience and Defiance. She laughs. \u201cI think I\u2019m finally ready to stand up from my chair,\u201d she says. She stands back from a version of herself on the easel. \u201cI called it Self-Portrait Standing. This is a kinder one of me than some, I think.\u201d\n\nWe both stare at the unforgiving, hollow-eyed portrait and I suggest it could be kinder still.\n\n\u201cDo you think? This one started as a very much more cruel image. So what I did, there is this painting by Frans Hals, a beautiful painting of a gorgeous young woman I saw, and I did a sketch of it and put it on the easel so that she would look kindly on me while I was doing it.\u201d\n\nIf Celia Paul had to escape from domineering male presences in her life, she also had to find a role for herself among her sisters (one of whom, Jane, is married to the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams).\n\nA portrait she made of the four sisters after her mother died in 2015, My Sisters Mourning seemed to capture something of the form of the famous painting of the Bront\u00eb sisters, by their brother Branwell. She suggests the reference was conscious.\n\n\u201cI also did a portrait of Patrick Bront\u00eb [the novelists\u2019 father] and then one of my own father,\u201d she says. \u201cWho died when I was 23. I had been thinking about absent fathers, which I guess is not far from thinking about God.\u201d\n\nHas religio been important to her?\n\n\u201cFrom the earliest memory every day started with prayer and ended with prayer,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it is still in my bloodstream, even though I am not conventionally religious. I am not good at belonging to groups. But doesn\u2019t everyone think about God?\u201d\n\nThat tendency, her memoir suggests, was one reason Lucian Freud was drawn to her, and one of her own means of keeping herself apart.\n\n\u201cI think what Lucian was most disturbed by,\u201d she says, \u201cwas my kind of stillness. He had no truck with God. He found that difficult to deal with.\u201d\n\nAnd determined to disrupt?\n\n\u201cYes absolutely. He found it disturbing even if I looked dreamily out of a window. He wanted me firmly in the world.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest My Sisters in Mourning, 2015-2016. Photograph: \u00a9 Celia Paul Courtesy the artist and Victoria Miro, London/Venice\n\nFreud encouraged her to think of their relationship like that between the youthful Gwen John and the ageing Auguste Rodin. John gave up painting for a time, \u201cto give herself up to this experience of being in love\u201d with the old master. Early in their affair, Freud encouraged Paul to do the same. Could she see the attraction of that?\n\n\u201cI think I might have been attracted to it if I hadn\u2019t known something of Lucian\u2019s past history,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was another of his girlfriends, Susie Boyt, who had also been at the Slade 25 years before me and had had five children, four with Lucian. She had stopped painting. Lucian and Susie went on being very close, and Lucian admired her tremendously, but I had the feeling that Lucian might have said something similar to her once in regard to Gwen John and Rodin.\n\n\u201cFor myself, I think Rodin and Lucian were in quite a profound way very different. Some of the greatest things Rodin did were watercolours of naked women. I felt he had a real empathy with women, as separate to himself, and I feel with Lucian there was always this element of control.\u201d\n\nLooking back, now she is at Freud\u2019s own age while they were together, does the relationship feel more uncomfortable than it did at the time?\n\n\u201cIt does, though when I was at the Slade several of the students were having affairs with tutors. The fact that Lucian said to me subsequently that he only came to the Slade to pick up a girl, didn\u2019t at the time seem shocking to me, or to anyone there. Whereas now to me it does seem shocking. I had approached him in the life room wanting to show him my drawings, because we both had drawn and painted our mothers. I had felt that affinity. But really that wasn\u2019t why he was drawn to me and that felt hurtful at the time.\u201d\n\nThe relationship with Freud was her first experience with men, she says, which, as her diaries make clear, made it harder to comprehend.\n\n\u201cI had been at a girls\u2019 boarding school,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t interested in boys or men, I was interested in art. I was shocked by Lucian pouncing on me. But part of me thought: \u2018Maybe this is what happens.\u2019 I talked to my mother about it. And my mother said to me: \u2018Well, maybe you are in love with him.\u2019 And I thought to myself: \u2018Well, maybe I am.\u2019 Somehow her saying that seemed almost to give permission for all of it.\u201d\n\nThough Freud had numerous children \u2013 there are 14 acknowledged sons and daughters but maybe 30 others \u2013 he professed to have no interest in babies. He maintained close relationships with his grown-up offspring \u2013 including Frank Paul \u2013 but could never have been confused for a hands-on father.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Girl In A Striped Nightdress, Or Celia 1983-85, by Lucian Freud. Photograph: Lucian Freud Archive / Bridgeman Images\n\nFreud began perhaps his most loving portrait of Paul, Girl in a Striped Nightshirt between 1983 and 1985, during which time she became pregnant and gave birth to Frank. \u201cHe was very caring while I was pregnant, we were very close during that time,\u201d Paul recalls. \u201cBut after, he was very pleased that I was going to ask my mother to help look after Frank. He expected me to come and be available as I had been, but obviously my life became more complicated.\u201d In 1985 when Freud made the portrait of Paul standing, and he bought this flat, they \u201cwere drifting apart in all sorts of ways,\u201d Paul says. \u201cWhen I first met Lucian he wasn\u2019t that famous. He was notorious, but he did not have a big international reputation or anything. He was a genuinely Dostoevskian character it seemed to me, living much more on the edge. And then later he became more a national treasure and was quite seduced by that.\u201d\n\nWhen did she last see Freud?\n\n\u201cI saw him actually on the day he died,\u201d she says. \u201cI saw him quite regularly at that time. A few weeks before he died I gave him a bath, and he always used to love having his back washed, and I washed his back with a sponge. He was much more gentle then and, of course, he wanted to regale me with stories about being friends with Princess Margaret and all that.\u201d\n\nThough she tried several times, Paul never completed a painting of Freud. \u201cI had a mattress on the floor of my studio and he would lie down on that and curl up,\u201d she says. \u201cI got quite far with one painting and then I just thought this isn\u2019t what I want to do and so gradually I stopped.\u201d She once made a pencil drawing of Freud asleep that she liked, but painted over it with a sketch of a kneeling penitent.\n\nLater she says, in another context: \u201cIt is quite telling of portraiture that love shines through. It is one of the reasons I know I can\u2019t paint people I don\u2019t love. If it works, it is only in a staged way.\u201d\n\nWhile we talk about this past there is the constant, distant noise from the street below from tourists and school parties visiting the museum. Paul seems suitably raised above that cacophony here.\n\nThe contrast of stillness is perfect for her, she suggests, though occasionally busking bagpipers below drive her mad. She imagines that in the future she may move away from London in search of greater peace \u2013 perhaps to the Preseli hills in west Wales where she spends holidays \u2013 but it is hard to imagine her apart from this studio.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m a braver person, less anxious than I was,\u201d she says. \u201cMy son is completely independent now. So I am freer than I\u2019ve ever been before.\u201d\n\nI ask about the rhythm of her days. She rises early, at five or six, depending on the light, she says. \u201cI have a cup of tea in bed when I look out at the sky. I know a lot of painters boast about working 14 hours a day. But that\u2019s not me. My things tend to come in great bursts. So sometimes I work long hours and then sometimes not many hours at all.\u201d\n\nYou would hesitate to describe Paul as a confident person, but she is possessed of a quietly cheerful certainty in her powers of persistence. She feels finally, she says, that she might be granted her own space apart from the alpha males of British painting. \u201cOne of the phrases I really don\u2019t like is \u2018in her own right\u2019,\u201d she says, as in: \u201cCelia Paul is also a painter in her own right.\u201d Her voice rises slightly in the stillness of the studio. \u201cI want there to be no question that I am a painter in my own right. I feel that my painting belongs to a whole tradition of British art. I can see connections between my work and Stanley Spencer, and Gwen John and Frank Auerbach. And that is the main way I am connected to Lucian,\u201d she says, firmly, \u201cas part of that spirit of British painting.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Celia Paul\u2019s memoir, Self-Portrait, is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a320).
