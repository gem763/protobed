Here are some highlights from his press conference a couple of days ago:\n\n\"Russia have gained in confidence, they look a fit team. The have obviously worked on their fitness. They have kept on going the longer the tournament has gone on.\n\n\"They were leading at half-time against Samoa, they were just trailing against Japan and they had 90 per cent tackle completion against Ireland. They have a very good scrum and an excellent kicking game.\"\n\n\"I thought the 10 [Ramil Gaisin] who played against Ireland was outstanding in his kicking. Seven [Tagir Gadzhiev] and eight [Nikita Vavilin] are also excellent players, while the tight-head [Kirill Gotovtsev] is one of the players of the tournament in the scrum.\n\n\"They will put everything into this. It\u2019s their last game, their last for four years in a World Cup or longer if they do not qualify. We are expecting as good a performance as they gave against Ireland, maybe even a level up.\"", "description": "The players are just going through their final warm-ups.", "authors": ["Charlie Morgan", "Brian Moore"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-world-cup/2019/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000212481093-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqcCUlY4ecowelYv5R9cM4V-bpMG9uWgcnc3MvHmUFhjA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
