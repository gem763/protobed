I'm not saying 'The Islanders'. I'll look like a f*****g idiot.'\n\nHe's not a fan! Wes Nelson, 21, pictured in February, is about to compete in The X Factor: Celebrity but is concerned his band's name, 'The Islanders', will make him 'look like an idiot'\n\nModel and former member of pop group EverYoung, Eyal quickly said that the X Factor name was still 'undecided' but added 'it's The Islanders for now.'\n\nDuring the interview the reality TV stars revealed a little about their preparations for the show, with Eyal saying that Wes is often late and can be a bit of a 'diva'.\n\nWes laughed and denied being a diva, saying the group 'just want to be known for something other than dating.'\n\nSingers: Fellow former Love Island contestants Samira Mighty, 22, Zara McDermott, 23, and Eyal Booker, 24, are joining Wes on the show which starts Saturday October 12\n\nFor their promo shoot with Heat, the Love Island stars paid tribute to band British band Queen.\n\nWes also couldn't help but make a dig at his ex, Megan Barton Hanson, who he split with after she became jealous of his relationship with Vanessa Bauer on Dancing On Ice.\n\nNow happily dating fellow Love Island star Arabella Chi, he said he has no worries that their romance will fall victim to the show.\n\nThe X Factor: Celebrity: The Love Islanders paid tribute to Queen in their promo shot for Heat and Wes Nelson (right) threw some serious shade at ex Megan Barton Hanson\n\nIconic: The new shots take inspiration from Queen's 1975 Bohemian Rhapsody\n\nHe said: 'I have absolutely no doubts about my relationship.
