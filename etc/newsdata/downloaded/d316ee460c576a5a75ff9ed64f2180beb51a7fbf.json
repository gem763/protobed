Here's What Could.", "language": "en", "text": "Now that wasn't so bad, was it? I mean the way the overbought action found its way into the market.\n\nWe had the Russell, which had been up more than 1% every day this week, take a breather. And we had the S&P 500 sell off into the close, something it hasn't done any other day this week. But it wasn't awful. It was just a loss of upside momentum.\n\nWhat will concern me, however, is if breadth continues to weaken day in and day out. What will concern me is if it weakens enough to get the indicators to roll over. Right now, I just think it's short-term overbought and that's it.\n\nWhat will also concern me is if there is no improvement in the number of stocks making new highs. On Thursday, Nasdaq saw a minor increase over last week's reading. That needs to continue and improve.\n\nYou don't want to see new highs with far fewer stocks making new highs. My rule of thumb is that when the number of new highs is contracting, it gets harder to make money on the long side. We saw that in July and you know what came in August.\n\nThe number of stocks making new highs on the New York Stock Exchange is a bit problematic, though.\n\nOn the sentiment side of things, we saw the American Association of Individual Investors' weekly survey with a rise in bulls and a big drop in bears. The bears fell 8 points. That means the four-week moving average is still heading down. But it hasn't gone down enough to be concerning. It feels more like folks are stepping into the pool, they are not all in yet.\n\nWe know they are stepping into the pool, because for the last three trading days the put/call ratio for exchange-traded funds has been under 100%. We haven't had three-straight days since late June. That's how we know the sentiment has shifted. But here again, when we look at the total put/call ratio's 10-day moving average as we see it has finally begun to come down, but it is not yet into the \"danger\" zone. There is room for more folks to get in the pool.\n\nFinally I have had several questions on interest rates. This downtrend line is obvious, but it has kept rates in check for nearly five months now, and I expect rates on the 10-Year Treasury to struggle as it gets closer. No one should be surprised if rates fall a bit in the next week. Keep in mind the chart of the Bank Index relative to the S&P. There is a downtrend line still in place there, so the two go hand in hand.\n\nFinally, the Daily Sentiment Index (DSI) for bonds was 95 in late August. It is now 42, so here, too, we've seen a sentiment shift, haven't we?", "description": "Ongoing weakening in breadth and a further lack of improvement in the number of stocks making new highs would be two of several signs of concern.", "authors": ["Helene Meisler", "Getting To Overbought Didn'T Hurt Too Much", "Did It", "Here'S What Could.", "Ongoing Weakening In Breadth", "A Further Lack Of Improvement In The Number Of Stocks Making New Highs Would Be Two Of Several Signs Of Concern.", "Paul Price", "James", "Rev Shark", "Jim Cramer"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/301de583-7bb6-11e8-9292-0f8658a3d91c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
