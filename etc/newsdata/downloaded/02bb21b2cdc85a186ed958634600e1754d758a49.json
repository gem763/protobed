Asked if she thought Trump had committed impeachable offenses, she stared straight ahead and glided by the cameras without a word.\n\nRep.

But he promised that Democrats would use every tool at their disposal to protect her from retaliation.\n\n\"I don't want to characterize what she said, but we feel very strongly that that would be wrong and ... we will do everything we can to protect any career employee who speaks to us pursuant to a legally binding subpoena,\" said Malinowski.\n\nRep.

And on Tuesday, the State Department blocked the testimony of Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, just hours before he was scheduled to appear in the Capitol.\n\nLater that same day, White House counsel Pat Cipollone informed Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the three key committee chairmen that the Trump administration would not comply with the impeachment inquiry, citing the lack of a formal vote authorizing it.\n\nDemocratic leaders have dismissed the argument, saying that the committees already have subpoena powers due to rules changes made by the GOP when it held the House majority.\n\nDemocrats are hoping they have better success next week, when they\u2019ve requested the testimony of five additional officials. The list includes Kent, Sondland and Fiona Hill, a former special assistant to the president on Russian affairs, who stepped down in August.\n\nSchiff declined to comment on what was said during the testimony, but described Yovanovitch to reporters as a \u201cmodel diplomat,\u201d and called her a \u201ccourageous example for others.\u201d\n\nSchiff did not comment on whether he would make the proceedings on Friday public.\n\nOthers were more talkative.
