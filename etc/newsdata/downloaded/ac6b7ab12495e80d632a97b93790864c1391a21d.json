That ultimately led to Ghosn -- with substantial assistance from his subordinates -- excluding more than $90 million in his own pay from Nissan\u2019s public statements to investors. Ghosn additionally took steps to increase his retirement allowance by $50 million, according to the regulator.\n\nThe SEC also reached a settlement with former Nissan director Greg Kelly, who agreed to pay a $100,000 fine over allegations that he helped hide Ghosn\u2019s pay. Ghosn was barred from serving as a director or officer of a public company for 10 years, while Kelly agreed to a five-year ban. Nissan, Ghosn and Kelly, 63, all resolved the cases without admitting or denying wrongdoing.\n\nPrompt Implementation\n\nNissan, based in Yokohama, said in a statement that it cooperated fully with the SEC and has \u201cpromptly implemented remedial acts to prevent recurrence.\u201d The company laid blame on Ghosn and Kelly, saying the executives\u2019 alleged misconduct \u201cserves as the basis for Nissan\u2019s liability.\u201d\n\nLawyers for Ghosn and Kelly said the decision to settle with the SEC should have no bearing on separate Japanese cases against their clients.\n\n\u201cGreg is a guy with limited resources,\u201d said James Wareham, a Washington-based attorney for Kelly. He said his client settled so that he can concentrate on the case he faces in Japan.\n\nAttorneys for Ghosn said they were pleased to put the SEC matter behind them in order to focus on an ongoing criminal case in Japan.\n\nNissan shares trade in the U.S. via American Depositary Receipts, which generally gives the SEC enforcement authority although the alleged improprieties took place mostly in Japan and Europe.\n\nJapanese Rule\n\nGhosn\u2019s decision to conceal his pay stemmed from a 2010 Japanese rule that forced executives to disclose their total compensation. Instead of complying -- and risking negative media coverage -- Ghosn crafted various strategies to obscure how much he received from Nissan, according to the SEC. Tactics included entering into secret contracts, backdating letters granting himself cash bonuses and manipulating his pension allowance, the regulator said.\n\nGhosn and Kelly face trials in Japan stemming from their alleged roles in masking pay. Japanese prosecutors also have accused Ghosn of transferring personal losses to Nissan and using company funds for financial transactions in the Middle East.\n\nFrench prosecutors have opened their own investigation into Ghosn, who previously served as Renault SA\u2019s chairman. The probe was initiated after Renault disclosed that Ghosn may have improperly used a company sponsorship deal to host his 2016 wedding party at the Palace of Versailles. The French automaker also has alerted French prosecutors to millions of euros paid by Ghosn to a distributor in Oman.\n\nA spokesperson for the French prosecutor declined to comment on the investigation Monday.\n\nGhosn\u2019s Wealth\n\nNissan has been eager to move beyond the scandal, which comes at a time when its growth has stalled and profits are dropping. Earlier this month, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa stepped down after admitting he had been overpaid. A replacement is expected to be appointed by the end of October.\n\nInside Nissan, the allegations involving Ghosn continue to reverberate. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that some Nissan lawyers have raised concerns that the company\u2019s internal investigation into the matter wasn\u2019t appropriately independent because the law firm that conducted it has had a long relationship with the automaker.\n\nThe SEC fines are unlikely to have a major impact on the finances of Nissan or its former executives. Nissan expects to earn an operating profit this year of 230 billion yen ($1.2 billion) and Ghosn had an estimated net worth of about $120 million earlier this year, according to an analysis by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Kelly\u2019s net worth is unknown, but he owns two properties in the U.S. -- his primary residence in Tennessee and a vacation home in Florida.\n\n(Updates with details from the SEC complaint in ninth paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Ania Nussbaum.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Matt Robinson in New York at mrobinson55@bloomberg.net;Chester Dawson in Southfield at cdawson54@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jesse Westbrook at jwestbrook1@bloomberg.net, Gregory Mott\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Nissan Motor Co. and Carlos Ghosn settled U.S. regulators\u2019 claims that they failed to disclose more than $140 million in pay to the embattled ex-chairman, one of the first legal accords in a saga that has put the automaker on its heels and tarnished the reputation of a business icon.Nissan", "authors": ["Matt Robinson", "Chester Dawson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6S3c3YK4Yey_ME28FpWgYw--~B/aD0xNDAwO3c9MjIwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/133d1ca7ae02dd7463c69b93fb65a15f", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
