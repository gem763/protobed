One of the large reptiles swimming in a stream in Zimbabwe reportedly attacked a nine-year-old girl\n\nLocal media outlet The Sunday News reported that when she saw her friend was being pulled under and struggling to stay afloat she leaped on in.\n\n'We had just left the water when we heard Latoya who was left alone swimming near the neck-deep zone screaming that something was biting her hand,' Rebecca said.\n\n'Since I was the eldest among the other seven children, I felt the urge to save her. So, I jumped into the water and swam to where she was struggling to float. She was screaming in pain that something was biting and pulling her under.'\n\nShe quickly realised the large crocodile had grabbed her younger friend by her hand and leg.\n\nLatoya Muwani attacked while swimming with friends in a stream in Sinderela Village in north east of the African nation of Zimbabwe\n\nWithout a moment to lose the 11-year-old decided to take on the reptile herself, mounting it and gouging its eyes till it loosened its grip.\n\n'I jumped on top of the crocodile and started beating it with my bare hands before using my fingers to poke its eyes until it released her. Once she was free, I swam with her to the banks where the other children pulled her out of the water. The crocodile fortunately did not attack us after it let off Latoya,'\n\nRebecca was not injured in the battle, but her friend was taken to St Patrick's Hospital for treatment.\n\nStock photo shows a crocodile at a farm in Zambia, Africa. This month it was reported that Rebecca Munkombwe did not hesitate to jump in and help her friend when she saw a large crocodile had grabbed the younger girl's leg\n\nA nurse at the hospital who spoke to the local media outlet on condition of anonymity said nine-year-old Latoya escaped with 'mild injuries'.\n\nLatoya's father, Mr Fortune Muwani told the news outlet when he heard his daughter had been attacked he imagined the worst.\n\n'How [Rebecca] managed to [save her] I don't know but am grateful to God,' he said.\n\n'Latoya is recovering well...and we expect her to be discharged soon,' Mr Muwani said.\n\nLocal councillor Steve Chisose said crocodile attacks were becoming a problem in the area as a result of an issue with water supply, leading women and children to use unprotected sources, such as those infested with the large reptiles.\n\n'The women are usually accompanied by their children who get naughty and end up swimming in these water bodies,' he said.", "description": "Latoya Muwani, 9, was reportedly attacked while swimming with friends in a stream in Sinderela Village in the African nation of Zimbabwe.
