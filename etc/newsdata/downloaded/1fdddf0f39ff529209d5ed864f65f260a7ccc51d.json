The rare match -- the first inter-Korean face-off on North Korean soil in almost three decades -- took place in an empty stadium, creating a bizarre experience for fans trying to follow it online.\n\nBoth South and North Korea now have two wins and a draw in their group, which also includes Lebanon, Sri Lanka and Turkmenistan. However, South Korea leads on goal difference, by 10 to 3.\n\nIn what turned out to be an anti-climax after much pre-game excitement, the match was held in bizarre circumstances, lacking a live broadcast, fans or media presence. The North did not allow the match to be broadcast, and denied entry to South Korean media. Those concerned, like officials from the Korea Football Association, media outlets and football fans, had to make do with brief updates on FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation's websites.\n\n", "description": "2 Koreas Draw World Cup Qualifier at Empty Stadium in Pyongyang", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/16/2019101600853_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
