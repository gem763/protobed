The poll also showed strong support for increased mental health resources and monitoring capabilities.\n\nThe poll arrives in the midst of the 2020 presidential campaign, where gun control has been a major focus of the Democratic primaries.\n\nEight of the leading Democratic candidates appeared in an advertisement last week in support of a gun control advocacy organisation led by Gabby Giffords, a former congresswoman who was shot in a 2011 shooting that left six people dead and 13 others injured.\n\nThe advertisement, titled \u201cOur Kids Deserve to be Safe at School,\u201d shows candidates including Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren calling for common sense measures to keep children safe from mass shootings in their schools.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
