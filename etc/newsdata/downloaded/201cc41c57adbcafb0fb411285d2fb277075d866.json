The problem has reached such a crisis level here that Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms (D) pledged $1 billion toward creating or preserving 20,000 affordable housing units by 2026, with half the money from public funds and half from private.\n\nBottoms isn\u2019t alone.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nD.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) issued an aggressive promise for her tenure \u2014 36,000 new units by 2025, 12,000 of them affordable. She challenged her counterparts in suburban Maryland and Northern Virginia to build 240,000 more over the same time frame.\n\nIn 2017, San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo (D) set a goal to build 25,000 new homes by 2023, 10,000 of them rent-subsidized, and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) aims to create or preserve 300,000 affordable units by 2026.\n\nYet the ambitious plans from coast to coast are facing mounting criticism. Some housing advocates assert that officials in the cities don\u2019t fully grasp the scope of the problem and aren\u2019t moving quickly enough to address it.\n\nAD\n\nAnd with the mayors offering little specifics on how they would generate the revenue to finance their goals, other experts say they worry that the numbers and time frame put forward may be empty promises.\n\nAD\n\nAtlanta\u2019s plan \u201ctalks about coming up with new revenue sources but doesn\u2019t name them or put a dollar figure on them,\u201d said Dan Immergluck, a professor in the Urban Studies Institute at Georgia State University in Atlanta. \u201cThere\u2019s not a commitment for new city money.\u201d\n\nHe urges Atlanta to take bolder and more specific actions, including approving $250 million in bonds, dedicating hotel/motel taxes toward affordable housing and raising property taxes.\n\nAD\n\nAs cities rethink single-family zoning, traditional ideas of the American Dream are challenged\n\nRent-burdened in Atlanta\n\nInland cities in the South like Atlanta have long been viewed as cheaper alternatives to coastal metros. Yet in some Atlanta neighborhoods, more than 72 percent of residents are rent-burdened, which the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development defines as spending more than 30 percent of one\u2019s income on housing. In 2015, 22 percent of Fulton County\u2019s renting households received an eviction notice.\n\nAD\n\nDownsizing the American Dream: The new trend toward \u2018missing middle housing\u2019\n\nCity leaders are particularly focused on Atlanta households earning below 60 percent of area median income (AMI), or roughly $28,000 for an individual. Their strategies include building units on publicly owned vacant land, rehabilitating units where people already live, upzoning for duplexes, triplexes and accessory dwelling units (ADUs), easing parking requirements and ensuring that landlords accept housing vouchers.\n\n\u201cOur population has increased by over 17 percent, but that\u2019s not enough,\u201d said Terri Lee, Atlanta\u2019s first chief housing officer. She added that growth is great for the city, but not if it means longtime residents must leave. \u201cWe have to do things to preserve the opportunity for our existing residents to stay here.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an ambitious plan, but, to Immergluck, a vague one.\n\nAD\n\nFor example, the city hasn\u2019t set yearly increments to reach the 20,000 figure, he said.\n\nAD\n\nWhile he agrees with Bottoms\u2019s overall goals, Immergluck said he wishes the city were moving faster.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seven years into this affordable housing crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cThese ideas have been floating around for a long time, yet there\u2019s no legislation. Where are the ordinances?\u201d\n\nFor residents like North, the need for quick action stands paramount.\n\nYet North also knows she\u2019s lucky. Rent in her building has risen only incrementally over the years, $50 or so at a time. She makes $18 an hour and knows many friends and relatives, including her daughter and grandchildren, who\u2019ve been forced out of the city by escalating prices. Her daughter\u2019s family slept in a hotel for more than a year before finally settling in a suburban Clayton County duplex. It\u2019s a long drive for them to visit northwest Atlanta, with no yard for the grandchildren to enjoy upon arrival.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPeople are coming in and remodeling houses, then putting them back up for sale,\u201d North said, estimating that homes near her unit off Highway 78 rent for at least $950 per month, $1,200 for a nicer place. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to do that, they need to provide some kind of program to help people buy those houses and have them be affordable.\u201d\n\nMeasuring municipalities\n\nOther cities face their own issues. With four years to go, San Jose stands more than 9,000 units short of reaching 10,000 affordable homes by 2023. The city reports 946 affordable units complete or under construction, with an additional 2,441 in the pipeline.\n\nFunding is a major concern. San Jose\u2019s housing director, Jacky Morales-Ferrand, estimates that more than $520 million is needed to meet the city\u2019s 10,000-unit goal. Apartment rents in San Jose grew 50 percent between 2010 and 2018, with the median now $2,600 per month for a two-bedroom unit.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe other housing crisis: Cities where home prices are low because people have left\n\nOne conundrum is that it costs cities more to house very-low-income earners \u2014 the lower the income, the more subsidy needed for housing. But because of high land costs in California, developers need high rents to justify building expenses.\n\nSan Jose remains largely suburban in character and aims for more downtown residential high-rises, more ADUs and more down-payment assistance for first-time buyers.\n\n\u201cNo solution is off the table,\u201d said Morales-Ferrand. The city has earmarked nearly $100 million toward affordable housing projects over the next several years and hopes to accelerate the pace of its program as 2023 approaches.\n\nFrom a pure numbers standpoint, the most ambitious mayoral goal is de Blasio\u2019s 300,000 affordable units created or preserved in New York by 2026. It\u2019s a large figure even for a place with more than 8 million residents.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, the Association for Neighborhood & Housing Development, a Manhattan-based tenants advocacy group, argues that simply targeting a number may be the wrong approach.\n\n\u201cAny goal that centers around a unit count is concerning,\u201d said Emily Goldstein, the association\u2019s director of organizing and advocacy. \u201cA simple unit count isn\u2019t always the best way to measure whether we\u2019re actually addressing the needs of New Yorkers who are most at risk of displacement or homelessness.\u201d\n\nGoldstein favors metrics such as reductions in homelessness or rent-burdened households, which \u201cget closer to the heart of how people are actually experiencing the affordability crisis.\u201d The vast majority of the need is at the lowest end of the spectrum, she said, which is not where the majority of resources are going.\n\nAD\n\nInstead, as New York and other major cities continue drawing new residents and educated young professionals, Goldstein said it\u2019s important to ensure that longtime residents can choose to stay.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFolks are being priced out, and they\u2019ve seen their neighborhoods priced out,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want to have the option to feel secure in their home and stay in a community where they\u2019ve been for decades. Their church, their doctor, their friends and their family is there. No one should have to pick up and move unless they actually want to go.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in Southeast Washington, some residents in the Congress Heights neighborhood aren\u2019t waiting for the city to act. Residents at Savannah Apartments recently joined forces with the Douglass Community Land Trust, which is buying the building with the goal of keeping the 65 units affordable rentals and preventing developers from converting them into condos.\n\nLand trust officials said they hope to use that approach elsewhere in the city.\n\n\u201cI guess we would be the guinea pigs,\u201d Savannah resident Tiffany Jessup told The Washington Post\u2019s Peter Jamison, adding that the move will allow residents to \u201cstay in a place we have called home.\u201d", "description": "Mayors have pledged more affordable housing units as fast-rising costs force out many lower- and middle-income residents, but some advocates worry the proposals may be little more than empty promises.", "authors": ["Haisten Willis"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/K0WagibDOpdL_XNpv0_X70TWrzU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S2CBFIXDREI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg"}
