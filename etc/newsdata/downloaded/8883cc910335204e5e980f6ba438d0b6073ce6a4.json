'The House', a 3,500 sq ft apartment with a private entrance, its own gym, a fully fitted kitchen, three bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms, a dining table for 10, a bar and a huge roof terrace with unparalleled views of the Manchester skyline.\n\nUnsurprisingly a stay doesn't come cheap with prices at \u00a31,750 a night - but that also includes seriously luxurious perks including a 24-hour personal concierge, valet parking, in-room dining and even use of the hotel's car, a Lexus RXL.\n\n(Image: Bevan Cockerill)\n\nSpeaking about the hotel, co-owner Ryan Giggs told the Manchester Evening News : \"I think it will be game changing.\n\n\"We have brought back to life a forgotten Manchester building which was hugely significant of its time.\n\n\"The design respects the heritage of the building and now we\u2019re protecting that history by restoring it.\n\n(Image: MEN Media)\n\n\"We will be sharing some incredible architectural history with people from all over the world for many years to come, and we hope that it will add another dimension to Manchester.\n\n\"It\u2019s also the type of building that enables the team to offer something really bespoke to guests, a tailored and individual service.\n\n(Image: Bevan Cockerill)\n\n\"There are some fantastic new developments just being finished [elsewhere in Manchester] and in the pipeline but none of them will have their own five star service department attached to them and that\u2019s what differentiates The House from anything else.\n\n\"We have a proven team in place who have been recognised in the industry for their exceptional service credentials.\n\n(Image: Bevan Cockerill)\n\n\"We\u2019re confident that the demand for a property like The House in city centre will be big. Manchester is progressive, it\u2019s moving quickly, so many people are now either moving into the city for the first time or back to the city because of the different business, sport and leisure opportunities there are.\n\n\"The House is a great space for people living on their own, for couples or even families because it\u2019s so versatile.\"\n\n(Image: Bevan Cockerill)\n\nFor those opting to stay in the hotel's regular suites rather than the penthouse, prices for stays start from \u00a3160 per night.\n\nYou can find out more on the Stock Exchange hotel website .\n\n(Image: Bevan Cockerill)\n\nAs for The House, when asked if he would opt for the luxury pad when he lived in Manchester, Ryan told Manchester Evening News: \"Yes, absolutely. I love big windows and lots of natural light and The House has floor to ceiling windows in every room.\n\n(Image: Bevan Cockerill)\n\n\"The design is very neutral which I like as I\u2019m all about adding personal touches with soft furnishings and artwork.\n\n\"If something like this was on the market when I was looking to live in Manchester I would have taken it.\"", "description": "Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs' new hotel in Manchester features a seriously lavish penthouse with its own gym, terrace and access to the hotel's Lexus", "authors": ["Daisy Jackson", "Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Men Media", "Bevan Cockerill"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20741314.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Stock-House-interiors_06.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
