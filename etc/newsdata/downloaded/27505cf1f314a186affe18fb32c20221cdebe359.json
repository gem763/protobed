Shortly after, John, Paul, George and Ringo braved thousands of screaming and crying fans at New York's Kennedy Airport on Feb. 7.\n\nBut it\u2019s their appearance on Sullivan\u2019s show that\u2019s recognized as a musical milestone, an event so entrenched in U.S. cultural history because of the sheer number of Americans who tuned in \u2014 73 million viewers, translating to a 45 percent rating and 60 percent share of televisions.\n\nNumbers tell a story. Individual recollections tell it differently. Yahoo News asked readers to share not just what they remember about that collective experience, but also how the Beatles altered their lives, families and communities. Here are some lightly edited excerpts from what they wrote this week.\n\n\u2018I started bopping around in my seat like a maniac\u2019\n\nIn February 1964, Anthony Ventre attended high school in East Stroudsburg, Pa., where a \u201cmixed rat pack of greasers and preppies\u201d vied for rungs on the social ladder. He was a greaser, he says, sporting a leather jacket, a ducktail and the original Brylcreem in his hair. Ventre remembers Elvis Presley\u2019s splash on the musical scene presaging the Beatles\u2019 arrival and sparking that first cultural change. He writes:\n\nEverything seemed locked in, tidy, foreordained. It seems strange now, when I look back, to think that music changed all that. Two of the more significant musical events of that era were Elvis Presley and the arrival in the United States of the Beatles.\n\nPresley had already made a big impression on the nuns at the Catholic school I attended. One of my pals, George Pabst, had made a gyrating, crotch-bumping spectacle of himself in the center of the school cafeteria and got his knuckles rapped by Sister Donald. The rest of us sniggered and were delighted, of course.\n\nThen came the Beatles!\n\nI was sitting outside Jack's Market in East Stroudsburg in a lime-green 1953 Ford waiting for my father to return with groceries when \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" came on the radio.\n\nI started bopping around in my seat like a maniac. My father returned, saw me, and questioned my sanity. Later on, when he saw and heard the music and pure excitement of the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show, I could tell that even he was amused.\n\nSuddenly, the \u201850s were laid to rest. Gone were the leather jackets, the ducktails and spit curls, replaced by mop tops, and a new type of hipness. Preppies were suddenly pushed to the back of the social bus as a new type of culture came on board.\n\nDear diary: The Beatles were on TV tonight\n\nFifteen-year-old Jacqueline Horsfall recalls Feb. 9 distinctly. Her dad called from the sofa: \"The Beatles are on TV. Don't you want to watch?\" She replied: \"The what? Beetles?\" She joined her parents to watch Ed Sullivan and while her mother was awestruck with the Beatles\u2019 performance, Horsfall says she was not impressed. She writes:\n\nThat night I wrote in my diary:\n\nSunday, February 9", "description": "Before the Beatles played six songs in two sets before 73 million Americans on the Feb. 9, 1964, Ed Sullivan Show, the secret was already out.
