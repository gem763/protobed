It says it is still on track to be able to complete journeys of up to 300 kilometre in one hour and on a single charge.\n\nIn a call with Remo Gerber, Lilium\u2019s chief commercial officer (CCO), he reiterated the company\u2019s plans for a \u201cmeaningful\u201d 2025 launch and talked up the 300 kilometre target range. Specifically, he explained that this means Lilium will be able to operate an air taxi service that connects cities and country regions, rather than simply speeding up travel time across a single city.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually quite clear in our mind what our goal is,\u201d Gerber told me when asked to elaborate on Lilium\u2019s 2025 ambitions. \u201cWe want to be live and a real, meaningful part of transportation ecosystems in several cities around the world. So what does that mean? We\u2019re having talks around the world with a number of different cities and governments and then entire regions to look at how we best connect them\u201d.\n\nDescribing England in the U.K. as one example of an ecosystem, where the main hubs are reachable within a 300 kilometre range, he says we could imagine services between London-Manchester, Manchester-Birmingham, Birmingham-London, \u201cor maybe down to Brighton and several other places\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo that is really a meaningful new addition to transportation opportunities for customers and for people to use every day,\u201d says Gerber. \u201cAnd that wouldn\u2019t be just something that will be useful for Londoners, but it would be just as useful for people living in the other larger towns but also \u2013 and that\u2019s where the timeline is [hard to predict] \u2013 how quickly other smaller cities jump on the opportunity\u201d.\n\nThe upside for building the landing pads, which will need to be close to other transport links, is that it will require a \u201cmanageable investment\u201d compared to much larger and more capital intensive infrastructure projects. The smallest and most affordable sizes of a pad will cost as little as half a million pounds to build, says Gerber.\n\n\u201cI can all of a sudden make one investment into a pad the size of a football field and be connected to all of these other 10 different pads in the country. And that\u2019s where we\u2019re coming in,\u201d he explains, revealing that Lilium is already having conversations with various different parties who are interested in creating a landing site.\n\n\u201cWe are developing the blueprints for people and we will be advising people what they need to build. Of course, we cannot go and build all around the world all of these landing sites, but where we will come in is to work with these cities to say \u2018how do we connect you in a meaningful way into the network, into the Lilium service\u2019. That\u2019s how you have to imagine it\u201d.\n\nIt won\u2019t all be tax payer-funded or public money, but private companies will also be courted. These could be shopping malls that want additional footfall or large businesses that want their business parks to be connected in different ways or want a 10 minute transfer to a specific airport.\n\nHowever, Gerber says Lilium will remain \u201cultra-cautious\u201d with regards to where Lilium landing pads are created so that there is \u201cno negative impact\u201d on communities.\n\n\u201cWe see the landing infrastructure to a very large extent is the public good,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWe see it a bit like on the scale of a train station, because it should have a use to the community that it serves and that\u2019s where really our whole philosophy comes in\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Lilium\u2019s first manufacturing facility is a 3,000 square meter space located at the company\u2019s headquarters in Southern Germany. It will soon be complemented by a second, much larger, facility which is already under construction at the same site. The plan is to be capable of producing hundreds of Lilium aircraft per year by the time commercial services begin in 2025.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous opportunity when you have the manufacturing sitting next to the engineers because they can work together\u2026,\u201d says Gerber. \u201cNow we know the performance is right, how do we tweak it so that it\u2019s actually also easy to make, so that we can get that scale? We\u2019re building the first manufacturing line to really produce this aircraft at scale\u201d.", "description": "Lilium, the Munich-based startup developing an on-demand \u201cair taxi\u201d service, has released its latest flight video \u2014 this time demonstrating a successful transition from vertical flight (liftoff) to horizontal flight.
