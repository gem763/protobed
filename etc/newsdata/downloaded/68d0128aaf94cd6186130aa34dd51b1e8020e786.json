EFS provides elastic storage, growing and shrinking automatically as files are created or deleted, without disruption.\n\nSee also: Amazon AWS: Complete business guide to the world's largest provider of cloud services\n\n\"As storage grows, the likelihood that a given application needs access to all of the files all of the time lessens, and access patterns can also change over time,\" the blog post penned by AWS senior technical evangelist Steve Roberts said.\n\n\"Two common drivers for moving applications to the cloud are to maximize operational efficiency and to reduce the total cost of ownership, and this applies equally to storage costs.\"\n\nTo fix this, AWS EFS IA with Lifecycle Management provides a performance tier suitable for files that are not accessed regularly, instead of keeping all of the data on hand on the fastest performing storage.\n\nMust read: Amazon Web Services: A cheat sheet (TechRepublic)\n\nEFS Lifecycle Management runs automatically behind the scenes, and when enabled on a file system, files that are not accessed according to the lifecycle policy chosen by the customer will be moved automatically to the cost-optimized EFS IA storage class, the cloud giant explained.\n\nAlthough the infrequently accessed data is held in a different storage tier, it's still immediately accessible. The only trade-off, AWS said, is slightly higher per operation latency for the files in the IA storage tier.\n\nAt July launch, the the EFS IA storage class was priced at $0.045/GB per month; AWS has reduced that to $0.025/GB per month.\n\nAmazon Elastic File System IA with Lifecycle Management is available now in all regions where Elastic File System is present.\n\nMORE FROM AWS", "description": "Amazon Elastic File System Infrequent Access with Lifecycle Management is available in all regions where Elastic File System is present.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/28/ea7d80fa-2a7e-474b-a849-e9ed0eb911af/thumbnail/770x578/8df41444714f3d5bb7e9eb69b9cc5024/reinvent-aws.png"}
