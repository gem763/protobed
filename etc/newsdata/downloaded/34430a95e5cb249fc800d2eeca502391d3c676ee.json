The state's largest utility said it would shut off electricity for the third time in as many weeks because of looming strong winds and high fire danger.\n\nPacific Gas & Electric said it would begin blackouts in the afternoon for about 940,000 homes and businesses in 36 counties for 48 hours or longer throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, wine country and Sierra foothills. That's about 90,000 more customers affected than previously predicted.\n\nThe entire communities of Healdsburg and Windsor were ordered to evacuate ahead of severe winds that could lead to erratic fire behavior near the blaze burning in wine country. The Sonoma County Sheriff's Office said it is expected to be the biggest evacuation in the county in more than 25 years.\n\nEvacuating the evacuation centers in Healdsburg due to the threat of the #KincadeFire.

Wind gusts could reach up to 85 mph, CBS News correspondent Janet Shamlian reports from Santa Clarita.\n\nWeather forecasts called for strong winds to lash much of the region over the weekend. It might be a record wind event, the National Weather Service warned.\n\nPG&E's warning came as firefighters battled flames in Northern and Southern California. A blaze Thursday destroyed at least six homes in the Santa Clarita area near Los Angeles and led to evacuation orders for up to 50,000 residents, although many were allowed back home after Santa Ana winds began to ease.nt containment. One firefighter was injured protecting two trapped residents from the flames, the station reported. All three were taken to a local hospital suffering from non-life threatening injuries and \"were expected to survive.\"\n\nWeather forecasts called for record strong winds to lash much of the region over the weekend.

The fire had burned 49 buildings, including 21 homes, and swept through nearly 40 square miles of the wine-growing region. It was 10% contained by Saturday morning.\n\nOne firefighter was injured protecting two trapped residents from the flames, CBS San Francisco reported. All three were taken to a local hospital suffering from non-life threatening injuries and \"were expected to survive.\"\n\nSeveral thousand people living in small communities in neighboring Lake County were warned to be ready to evacuate if an order is given. The area was the scene of a 2015 wildfire that killed four people and burned nearly 2,000 homes and other buildings.\n\nHigh winds this weekend could ground water-dropping aircraft, disperse fire retardant and drive hot embers far ahead of the flames to set new blazes, Cal Fire Division Chief Jonathan Cox said.\n\n\"You can't fight a fire that's spotting ahead of itself a quarter of a mile, half a mile, in some cases a mile ahead of itself,\" he said.\n\nNo cause has been determined for any of the current fires, but PG&E said a 230,000-volt transmission line near Geyserville had malfunctioned minutes before that fire erupted Wednesday night.\n\nThe utility acknowledged that the discovery of the tower malfunction had prompted a change in its strategy.\n\n\"We have revisited and adjusted some of our standards and protocols in determining when we will de-energize high-voltage transmission lines,\" Andrew Vesey, CEO of Pacific Gas & Electric Co., said at a briefing Friday.\n\nThe weekend forecasts detail what could be the strongest winds of the year coupled with bone-dry humidity.\n\n\"These places we all love have effectively become tinderboxes,\" Vesey said. \"Any spark, from any source, can lead to catastrophic results. We do not want to become one of those sources.\"\n\nThe possible link between the wine country fire and a PG&E transmission line contained grim parallels to a catastrophic fire last year that tore through the town of Paradise, killing 85 people and destroying thousands of homes in the deadliest U.S. fire in a century.\n\nState officials concluded that fire was sparked by a PG&E transmission line.\n\nAsherah Davidown, 17, of Magalia and her family lost their house, two dogs and a car in the Paradise fire. She said her family was preparing for another power outage by filling the gas tank of their car and buying non-perishable foods and batteries for their flashlights.\n\nThe outages reminded her of her family's vulnerable position as they struggle to get back on their feet.\n\n\"My house doesn't have a generator so that means another weekend of sitting in the dark with no Wi-Fi, no food in the fridge and shopping in increments since we don't know how long the power may be out,\" Davidown said.\n\nThe continuing round of power outages made her feel somewhat vulnerable as her family tries to get back on its feet, she said.\n\n\"For the most part a lot of people feel really helpless. Their livelihoods are at the fingertips of a corporation,\" she said. \"There's still a lot of hurt and emotional recovery. Having our basic needs repeatedly taken away is really unfortunate.\"", "description": "Weather forecasts called for record strong winds to lash much of the region over the weekend, with some gusts hitting 85 mph", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/26/763b8de8-1171-4444-b597-d0afd98effe1/thumbnail/1200x630/e06b73f6421b6db597ecb9b955b12fac/house-fire-gettyimages-11781022421.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
