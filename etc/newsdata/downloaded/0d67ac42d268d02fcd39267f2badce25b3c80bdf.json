Most Cabinet ministers have not been briefed on the details of the proposals.\n\nBut there is speculation the plan might try to give Northern Ireland the 'best of both worlds' - staying within both the UK and EU customs unions.\n\nBrexit Secretary Steve Barclay and Michel Barnier are having crucial talks today as the sides make one last push for a deal\n\nMr Barclay arrived at the EU commission's headquarters in the Belgian capital this morning\n\nThis model would be based on an idea previously floated when Theresa May was PM, and could see EU tariffs apply on goods going from mainland Britain to the island of Ireland - but rebates given to businesses in the north.\n\nThat could potentially do away with the need for border infrastructure on the island, although some doubt it will end up being acceptable to the DUP.\n\nWhat happens next in the Brexit crisis? Here is how the coming weeks could pan out: Today: Michel Barnier and Steve Barclay holding talks in Brussels. It is the EU's deadline for having a deal in place ready for next week's summit. October 14: Parliament is due to return for the Queen's Speech. October 17-18: A crunch EU summit in Brussels. Any deal could be signed off by leaders here. October 19: Parliament will sit on Saturday for the first time since the Falklands War. f there is no Brexit deal by this date Remainer legislation obliges the PM to beg the EU for an extension to avoid No Deal. Jeremy Corbyn has said that he will only let Mr Johnson trigger an election after an extension has been secured. If there is a deal, it will start being rushed through Parliament immediately. October 31: The current deadline for the UK to leave the EU. November/December: An election looks inevitable.\n\nIf the meeting between Mr Barclay and Mr Barnier goes well, it should lead to the so-called 'tunnel' of intensive negotiations in the coming days - ahead of a crunch EU summit next Thursday.\n\nMr Varadkar warned that negotiations on a deal could yet collapse, saying: 'There's many a slip between cup and lip and lots of things that are not in my control.'\n\nThe summit, at Thornton Manor in Cheshire, was attended by only the PM's most senior officials, including chief adviser Dominic Cummings and Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill.\n\nAt one point, the two leaders even took a walk in the grounds as they strove to find a way through the impasse.\n\nWhen they emerged, they issued a statement, hailing a 'detailed and constructive' discussion, and saying: 'Both continue to believe that a deal is in everybody's interest. They agreed that they could see a pathway to a possible deal.'\n\nMichael Gove described the talks as 'very encouraging', adding: 'I hope the optimistic and constructive approach that both sides showed can result in more progress.'\n\nMr Varadkar and UK officials voiced hopes that Mr Barnier would agree to take the negotiations into the 'tunnel', but there were fears the Frenchman would refuse to countenance anything that might dilute the single market.\n\nIn another warning sign, Eurosceptic MPs have warned that Mr Johnson would face defeat at Westminster if he offered any further significant concessions.\n\nNo10 selected 19th-century Thornton Manor - now a luxury wedding venue - as a 'neutral' venue for the negotiations and tried to cloak the talks in secrecy.\n\nMr Varadkar, who has long been seen as the roadblock to an agreement, added that he even believed a deal could be 'done by the end of October'\n\nAfter three hours of talks at a country manor on the Wirral, the Prime Minister and his Irish counterpart said they could see a 'pathway to a possible deal'\n\nMr Varadkar has been the most hardline supporter of the so-called Irish backstop, which Mr Johnson has pledged to scrap.\n\nBut with the UK and the EU potentially just three weeks from a damaging No Deal, the two men appeared to set aside their previous positions in an attempt to find a compromise.\n\nTo the surprise of aides, the two leaders banished officials for almost two hours as they talked through potential ideas - and held frank talks on what would be acceptable to their parliaments and voters.\n\nSpeaking after the meeting, Mr Varadkar struck a remarkably upbeat tone, describing the talks as 'very promising'.\n\n'I think it is possible for us to come to an agreement, to have a treaty agreed, to allow the UK to leave the EU in an orderly fashion and to have that done by the end of October,' he added.\n\nMr Varadkar added: 'In terms of concessions, I don't think this should be seen in the context of who's making concessions or who the winners or losers are.'\n\nThe Taoiseach insisted the new plan would meet Ireland's key objective that there would be 'no customs border' between Northern Ireland and the Republic.", "description": "Steve Barclay and Michel Barnier are meeting over breakfast in Brussels after dying hopes of a settlement were dramatically revived.", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/08/19575700-0-image-a-11_1570777868672.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
