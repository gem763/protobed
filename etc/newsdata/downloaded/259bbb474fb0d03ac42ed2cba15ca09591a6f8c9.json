He proposes that individuals be given seven rights regarding data, including the right to know what data is being collected on you and the right to port your data to a different platform.\n\nThough Yang's proposal might make data-hoarders like Facebook and Google groan\u2014the latter was hit with a \u20ac50 million fine for a data privacy violation in January and was recently accused of further violations\u2014blockchain startups have a head start on implementing them.\n\nU.S. Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang says words about blockchain at Consensus\n\nSelf-sovereign identity, like \"collusion,\u201d is a term many people use but few fully understand. The Sovrin Network, which seeks to use blockchain technology to enable web-based self-sovereign identity globally, defines it as \"the digital movement that recognizes an individual should own and control their identity without the intervening administrative authorities.\"\n\nIn other words, blockchain can not only enable decentralized money, it can also facilitate a decentralized online identity in which credentials and personal data are shared and verified securely.\n\nPhil Windley, chair of the Sovrin Foundation, which governs the Sovrin Network, told Decrypt that the current online model is one in which \"we are inside the administrative system of another party\" whenever we log on to a website. The rights Yang enumerated, on the other hand, read similarly to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect in 2018. They represent an improvement, said Windley.\n\nHe urged, however, that people be real about data ownership, because self-sovereign identity isn\u2019t actually a solo endeavor. Instead, it lays the ground rules for a peer relationship. \"Almost no data is generated just by an individual. Rather, data is usually generated by multiple parties as part of a process,\" Windley said.\n\nMoreover, people trade security for convenience constantly, for instance, signing in with Google to a third-party website without knowing how their login and profile information is being used.\n\nAny new regulations, then, necessitate a reorientation of how people view their data and their relationship with companies.\n\nIt's a two-way conversation, but Yang's proposal may be a good way to start it.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Reason 348 why Andrew Yang gets support from many in the crypto crowd: He wants to protect your data.", "authors": ["Jeff Benson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iaVX4TUmN.d8y.XXfDI8xA--~B/aD00NzA7dz05MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/decrypt_251/8e8c0a7059e7d3c9574427783038fb81"}
