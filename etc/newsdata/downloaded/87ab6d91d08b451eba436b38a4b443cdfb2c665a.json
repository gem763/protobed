It plays in the same field as HP\u2019s Spectre x360 15, Microsoft\u2019s Surface Book 2, and Apple\u2019s 15-inch MacBook Pro.\n\nRight out of the box, Dell gets most things right with the XPS 15 2-in-1, with a just few areas that need improvement. Its build quality, attention to detail, power, and flexibility add up to a high-end experience that matches its premium price.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say you get what you pay for with the XPS 15 2-in-1. It starts at $1,299, but the model I\u2019ve been testing costs nearly a grand more at $2,199. That price gets a quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, a 512GB of storage, a 4K touchscreen, and AMD\u2019s integrated Radeon Vega M graphics. The most costly part of that is the 4K screen, so you can save quite a bit by opting for the 1080p panel. No matter which model you buy, the Vega M graphics come along for the ride. It\u2019s a solid package that I\u2019ve been able to live and work with \u2014 mostly in harmony.\n\nOur review of Dell XPS 15 2-in-1 Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Excellent build quality\n\nGreat 4K screen\n\nTouchpad and keyboard work well\n\nLong battery life Bad Stuff Keys are too shallow\n\nBoring design\n\nNo USB-A Buy for $1,299.99 from Dell\n\nLooking at the XPS 15 2-in-1\u2019s chassis is well, an unimpressive viewing \u2014 Dell\u2019s XPS laptops have been using the same basic design language for years now and it looks dated. Most of the laptop is covered in metal topped with a silver finish, and when opened up, a faux carbon fiber palm rest. It has a rubberized, smooth texture that makes it by far one of the most comfortable palm rests I\u2019ve used and despite being prone to fingerprints, it\u2019s easy to clean.\n\nDell\u2019s build quality is unmatched\n\nOverall, the design might be boring, but the XPS makes up for that with excellent build quality. The palm rest, display, touchpad, and keyboard hardly exhibit any noticeable give \u2014 there are no wobbly underside or clicking fans here.\n\nHowever, the Dell XPS 2-in-1 isn\u2019t a lightweight, weighing in at almost 4.5 pounds. That\u2019s more than the 15-inch MacBook Pro, Surface Book 2, and even some full-fledged gaming laptops. I don\u2019t think anyone wants to walk around with a four-plus pound tablet, because it\u2019s cumbersome and awkward to use, but since the XPS is a convertible, you can do that if you want.\n\nNo one wants a four pound tablet\n\nThe 360-degree hinge also lets you use the XPS in an easel or movie-watching mode, both of which are probably more practical than as a tablet. The hinge is quite sturdy and doesn\u2019t have the horrible screen wobble so many 2-in-1s are plagued by. On the flip side, it\u2019s very hard to open the XPS 15 2-in-1 with one hand, thanks to that stiff hinge and no cut out to slip your finger into.\n\nWhen it comes to ports, the XPS 2-in-1 reminds me of the not-so-loved 15-inch MacBook Pro: two USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports, two USB-C 3.1 ports with DisplayPort, an audio jack, microSD card slot (I\u2019m not sure what to do with it), lock slot, and a battery level indicator. There\u2019s no full-size USB-A port \u2014 which is a travesty \u2014 and while I appreciate the forward-thinking of including USB-C, user adoption still isn\u2019t high enough for me to swear it off, then have to buy a dongle.\n\nDell does get your dongle collection started by including a USB-C to A adapter in the box, but I\u2019d much rather just have the port built into the machine itself. Fortunately, you can charge the laptop using any one of the four USB-C ports.\n\nThe screen on the Dell measures 15.6 inches (with a 16:9 ratio), has thin bezels, and supports Dell\u2019s included stylus. It\u2019s the highlight of this XPS 15 2-in-1 unit, because this 4K display pops. By default, Dell sets Windows 10\u2019s display scaling to 250 percent, which makes everything comically large \u2014 moving it down to something like 225 or 200 percent lets you better take advantage of the screen\u2019s real estate.\n\nIt\u2019s a gorgeous 4K screen\n\nColors are bright, with tons of pop and contrast without too much image sharpening. The 4K option has 100 percent Adobe RGB certification (with some variance between displays), which is useful if you\u2019re planning to do any serious image editing with it. Dell advertises 400 nits of brightness and while eyeballing it next to the Spectre 15-inch x360, the Dell definitely appears to be the brighter and better looking 4K experience.\n\nDell deserves credit for including a capable stylus with the XPS 15 2-in-1, unlike HP, which throws in a basic one, or Microsoft that doesn\u2019t give you any stylus at all. The included pen has 4,096 levels of pressure and is the closest equivalent to the Surface Pen I\u2019ve tested. It\u2019s a great stylus, has good weighting, and draws with precision. It also supports angle input for shading.\n\nThe XPS 15 2-in-1\u2019s keyboard is nearly as shallow as the MacBook Pro 15-inch, but other than that, there isn\u2019t anything like it. It\u2019s clickier, has better tactile response, and I find it more enjoyable to type on, overall. Also, it\u2019s hopefully more reliable than Apple\u2019s issue-prone keyboard. However, the backlight brightness is not as bright as I hoped and the Page Up and Page Down keys are unceremoniously located above the left and right directional keys \u2014 it\u2019s just asking for an incorrect entry.\n\nShallow keys, but they\u2019re okay\n\nThe trackpad is Precision-enabled, but is a tad small considering the overall real estate on the palm rest. Regardless, it has a fast, accurate input with support for all of Windows 10\u2019s gestures, and the results are exactly what I look for: smooth.\n\nDell makes it very easy to log in to the computer by supporting both fingerprint sign-in \u2014 via the power button \u2014 and facial recognition via the IR camera, located at the bottom of the display, under the \u201cDell\u201d logo. The webcam placement is a sacrifice made for the thin bezel design, but as I\u2019ve found out before (and more than once) it\u2019s entirely possible to have thin bezels and place the webcam where it belongs \u2014 at the top of the screen.\n\nIt\u2019s been said before, but I\u2019ll say it again: Dell\u2019s camera placement means that all of your video calls will have horribly unflattering up-the-nose angles and your fingers will block the camera when you type.\n\n\u201cThis Dell rips,\u201d are words that I\u2019d rarely ever say, but they are true about this XPS 15 2-in-1. Processor-wise, the Core i7-8750G is a speedy quad-core processor \u2014 that part is well-known \u2014 but there is little (if any) crapware installed upon first booting the XPS 15 2-in-1.\n\nSo your first few times using the system is clear-headed and uncluttered, as it should be. Photoshop, Lightroom, Premiere, and other Adobe suite apps should have no issue running in large batch operations here.\n\nDidn\u2019t expect light gaming performance\n\nWhere the XPS 15 2-in-1 surprised me in terms of performance was with graphically intensive apps, or rather, games. League of Legends can run at a consistent 60 fps and full 4K resolution. Counter Strike: Global Offensive runs just as well, but a graphics-intense title like Rainbow Six: Siege requires some settings tweaks, to a lower resolution with less eye candy. It won\u2019t hold a candle next to a purpose-built gaming laptop, but it\u2019s still impressive because the XPS 15 2-in-1 wasn\u2019t designed for gaming to being with.\n\nI\u2019m used to seeing just five hours of battery life with 2-in-1 computers that have 4K touchscreens, but the XPS 15 2-in-1 surprised me with seven hours of use between charges. It\u2019s not as long as you\u2019ll get with an ultrabook or Microsoft\u2019s Surface Book 2, but it\u2019s on par with the 15-inch MacBook Pro and other powerful laptops. The light-up battery gauge on the left side offers limited info as to how much battery is left, but it is useful for eyeballing it.\n\nDell has established the XPS 15 2-in-1 as one of the best laptops in its class. The XPS 15 2-in-1 blends all the benefits of having a 4K display, powerful chipset, and aesthetic integrity, without the user having to sacrifice too much battery life, excessive heat, or poor build quality. While the design choices of Dell still seem a bit dated, everything else about the XPS 15 2-in-1 performs as you\u2019d expect\u2026 which is the right way.\n\nThe 4K screen is an expensive upgrade\n\nThe biggest issue might be the XPS 15 2-in-1\u2019s price, which isn\u2019t as high as a MacBook Pro or Surface Book 2, but still a significant cost. You can skip the 4K screen for a 1080 panel and save quite a few hundred dollars, while still maintaining many of the other qualities that make this XPS so good to use. You might even get better battery life and performance with the lower-resolution screen, but 4K just makes it that much better because of the Adobe RGB support and resolution.\n\nAlthough the XPS 15 2-in-1 is a very expensive laptop with a boring design, it does most everything it\u2019s supposed to well, which might be enough to make you forget about its cost and sleepy styling.", "description": "Dell is taking on the 2-in-1 laptop market by applying a lot of the same strategies that worked for the original XPS laptops, but now for a 15.6-inch, 4K-equipped laptop. It\u2019s compelling, up until the point of the slightly warm keyboard and the high-end price. But for the most part, Dell has a winner here.", "authors": ["Stefan Etienne", "Jul", "Photography Amelia Holowaty Krales", "The Verge"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BWwSCqXQPacdEK8KtD-CWwk9YP0=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11616191/akrales_180628_2695_0016.jpg", "published_at": "2018-07-02"}
