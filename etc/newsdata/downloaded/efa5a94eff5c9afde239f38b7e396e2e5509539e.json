When we got into the elevator Kanye just stood there with his arms folded and said, \u2018Aren\u2019t you going to press the button?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen Steve said he wasn't sure which floor he wanted to go to, he claims: [Kanye] flipped out, squealing that his time was precious and that he couldn\u2019t believe I hadn\u2019t called ahead to find out which floor he worked on.\"\n\n\u201cI was amazed by the amount of bizarre behavior I saw in just two weeks,\u201d said Steve. \"It is his world and everyone just exists within it. I don\u2019t know how Kim stays married to him.\"\n\n(Image: E!)\n\nSteve also claimed on another occasion Kanye got annoyed when his bodyguard 'got in his shot' as the paparazzi swarmed and began taking photos.\n\nHe also alleged he was forced to only wear black clothing at work as patterns 'distracted' Kanye.\n\nSteve says he was eventually fired from the job after less than two weeks when Kanye accused him of breaking one of his biggest rules - speaking to Kim Kardashian.\n\nOn the night of the Met Gala , Kanye saw Steve standing in a corridor with Kim and fired him the same night, says Steve.\n\n(Image: Wireimage)\n\nAfter Steve went public with his allegations Kim and Kanye were said to have threatened their former bodyguard with a hefty $10million lawsuit.\n\nA rep for Kim and Kanye told the Mirror at the time: \"The West Family will no longer tolerate the spreading and selling of fake stories in an desperate, transparent and shameless attempt for publicity at their expense.\n\n\"This sad, parasitic maniac has violated every basic human tenet of decency with his story of lies. As such, the Wests will explore all legal means at their disposal to silence this nonsense.\"\n\nAccording to TMZ , they threatened him with a hefty lawsuit - unless he stops dishing the dirt and publicly apologises for what they insist are completely false claims.\n\nThe site claimed \"Steve signed a confidentiality agreement promising never to breathe a word about Kim, Kanye or the klan\", and he's reportedly ordered to pay $10million if he ever breaks it.", "description": "Bodyguard to the stars Steve Stanulis described the Yeezus rapper as his most difficult client ever", "authors": ["Lucy Needham", "Image", "Getty Images For Thr", "E", "Wireimage"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20575846.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Kanye-West-voices-his-last-minute-disapproval-over-wife-Kim-Kardashians-underwear-style-Met-Gala.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
