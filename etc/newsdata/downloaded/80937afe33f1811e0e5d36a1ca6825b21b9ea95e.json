The film follows a lonely man named Arthur Fleck (played by Joaquin Phoenix) as a series of incidents gradually push him to become Batman's criminal nemesis.\n\nThe movie has received high praise from many critics. It won the Golden Lion award for best film at the Venice Film Festival. Phoenix has also garnered Oscar buzz for his performance. Heath Ledger won a posthumous Academy Award for his portrayal of the Joker in \"The Dark Night.\" Jack Nicholson was nominated for a Golden Globe for his take on the character in 1989's \"Batman.\"\n\nWhy there's debate\n\nDebate about \"Joker\" has shifted from its merits as a film into concerns whether its main character \u2014 a disaffected loner who uses his alienation from society as a rationale for killing \u2014 might inspire real-world violence from men in similar circumstances. One critic called it a \"toxic rallying cry for self-pitying incels.\" Incel is a self-imposed label chosen by \"involuntary celibate\" young men responsible for mass killings in Isla Vista, Calif., and Toronto.\n\nThese concerns are heightened by memories of the 2012 shooting in Aurora, Colo., which took place during a screening of \"The Dark Knight Rises.\" Parents of some victims in that shooting have expressed their unease with a film that gives a villain like the Joker a \"sympathetic origin story.\" Police departments are increasing their presence at screenings of the film as a deterrent.\n\nWarner Bros. released a statement saying \"Joker\" is not an \"endorsement of real-world violence,\" and the film doesn't \"hold this character up as a hero.\" That sentiment has been echoed by some critics who say the movie's plot is much more nuanced than detractors \u2014 many of whom have yet to see the film \u2014 make it out to be.\n\nOthers question the power of any piece of art, regardless of its content, to directly lead to violence in real life.\n\nWhat's next\n\nEarly indicators suggest \"Joker\" will be a box office hit and may attract attention during awards season. Director Todd Phillips has said there are no plans for a sequel but suggested he may be open to one if Phoenix were interested in reprising the role.\n\nPerspectives\n\nIt's dangerous\n\nThe film validates the anger of potentially dangerous young men\n\n\"'Joker' is an attempt to elevate nerdy revenge to the plane of myth, which is scary on a lot of different levels.\" \u2014 David Edelstein, Vulture\n\nThe movie may unintentionally resonate with the wrong people\n\n\"[The film may] speak to the people in our world who are predisposed to think of Arthur as a role model: lonely, creatively impotent white men who are drawn to hateful ideologies because of the angry communities that foment around them.\" \u2014 David Ehrlich, IndieWire\n\n\"Joker\" can't be separated from the real-world violence its story echoes\n\n\"The message that 'well, of course he became a mass murderer, society gave him no choice!' is dangerous on its own. But if you consider the larger social context of turning 'a supervillain into a kind of folk hero' in a world where Dylann Roof, Elliot Rodger, and Faisal Hussain exist, it\u2019s even more distressing.\" \u2014 Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Refinery 29\n\n\"Joker\" could be seen as providing a rationale for violence\n\n\"...the movie plays right into advance fears that it could act as a kind of incel manifesto, offering not just comfort or understanding to disaffected young men angry at the world but a playbook for striking back at it.\" \u2014 Sam Adams, Slate\n\nArt can and does influence real-life behavior\n\n\"I don\u2019t have the answer as to exactly what we should do about a movie like \u2018Joker\u2019 coming out at a time like this. But I do know there\u2019s great power in art, and we owe it to ourselves \u2014 and a generation growing up with the specter of mass shootings looming over their offices, schools, and movie theaters \u2014 to wield that power with great responsibility.\" \u2014 Rick Marshall, Digital Trends\n\nIt's harmless\n\nArt can't be blamed for real-world violence\n\n\"Individual pieces of pop culture, be it movies, TV or video games, don\u2019t turn empathetic people into murderers.\" \u2014 Scott Mendelson, Forbes", "description": "The new superhero film \"Joker\" tells the origin story of one of the most iconic villains in comics.
