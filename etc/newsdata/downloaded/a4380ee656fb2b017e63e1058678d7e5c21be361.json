It got a whole lot scarier this week.\n\nSouth Africa is now in Japan\u2019s way at the Rugby World Cup and the two-time champion will have to be at its strongest and at its sharpest to avoid becoming another one swept aside by an exhilarated home team and host nation in the quarterfinals this weekend.\n\nRankings mean nothing. Ask Ireland, rugby\u2019s top-ranked team coming into the World Cup and then run off its feet by Japan in a shocking upset in Shizuoka.\n\nPrevious records mean zero, too. Ask Scotland, which had beaten Japan in seven out of seven previous tests and led the Japanese early in the last game of the pool-stage before having the carpet yanked out from under their feet in Yokohama on Sunday.\n\nJapan is in the quarterfinals for the first time and the scene may never be better set for such an outsider to threaten the Rugby World Cup final. Beat South Africa, as Japan has done before at the World Cup, and then it\u2019s Wales or France for a place in the final. Seems outlandish, but tell Japan that after all that\u2019s happened.\n\nIf the Springboks and Erasmus didn\u2019t see it coming, it\u2019s not because they haven\u2019t been warned.\n\nThey were asked countless times through their pool-stage games what they thought of the possibility of playing Japan in the quarters. For the most part, they answered in typically cautious fashion: It\u2019s not decided. It could still be Ireland or Scotland. We haven\u2019t thought that far ahead.\n\nThe one moment Erasmus did let his guard down was on the day Japan upset Ireland. The Springboks were playing Namibia in Toyota City and Erasmus was late for his team\u2019s on-field warmup. He was watching Japan vs. Ireland on TV somewhere in the stadium and he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off it.\n\nIt was then that Erasmus conceded playing Japan was \u201ca realistic option. And also a scary option.\u201d\n\nThe Springboks have two memories of Japan in test rugby and they couldn\u2019t be further apart. There\u2019s the so-called Miracle of Brighton, when the Japanese left rugby flabbergasted by beating the Springboks at the 2015 World Cup.\n\nBut what of the most recent meeting? Three weeks before Japan stunned the World Cup again to beat Ireland, it played South Africa in a World Cup warmup game in Kumagaya. The Springboks won 41-7 and the Japanese seemed meek. They were nothing like the ferocious, non-stop force they were against Ireland and Scotland.\n\nErasmus said the idea behind the warmup game was to \u201cerase the Brighton game\u201d in case the were another meeting in the playoffs, and \u201cthat game hopefully doesn\u2019t get mentioned again.\u201d\n\nOf course, he knows that\u2019s not going to happen. The upset of \u201815 will be mentioned frequently for at least another week.\n\nAlso, there\u2019s the chance the Japan squad intentionally played within themselves in Kumagaya, so as not to give everyone an early warning of their threat. Or could have been leg-sore from heavy conditioning in training, all designed for fitness to peak in the World Cup.\n\n\u201cOnly time will tell. I must say that in that warmup game, there was no pressure,\u201d Erasmus said. \u201cIt was a warmup game, and the way Japan have embraced the pressure, it\u2019s really impressive. The way they have built and accepted the pressure . that will be something massive on Sunday, which will play a big role.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see how both teams handle the pressure and expectations on both sides.\u201d\n\nVeteran Springboks prop Tendai Mtawarira is looking at this Sunday\u2019s game at Tokyo Stadium only in isolation.\n\nAsked if South Africa would like some revenge for the Brighton upset, Mtawarira consigned that game to the past.\n\n\u201cThis is an entirely new challenge. I am looking forward to it. It\u2019s a big one,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Japanese team have really been performing well and it\u2019s going to be a big one.\n\n\u201cThey are unbeaten so far, and they have been great hosts. So, for us, it\u2019s a massive, massive game.\u201d\n\nMtawariri said it was important for the Springboks to stick to their strengths, and not be goaded into taking on Japan at a frenetic pace.\n\n\u201cWe know the style of rugby we like to play, so the challenge is to not get sucked into their game. We must play our game,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer John Pye in Tokyo contributed to this report.\n\n______\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Two weeks ago, Springboks coach Rassie Erasmus described it as a \"scary\" prospect.
