He must be allowed to recover his joy on the pitch, as he is very important for Barcelona, especially when on his best form.'\n\nBarcelona face sixth-placed Sevilla on Sunday, with both teams level on 13 points from seven games and, while Messi is more than likely to feature in only his third La Liga game of the season, Rivaldo urges caution.\n\n'Of course Messi wants to play. But it could be time to reflect with the medical staff and check if playing too much time after coming back from an injury could be risky for his recovery,' he said.\n\n'It's an important match against Sevilla but there is a lot of the league season to play yet, so perhaps protecting the player could reap rewards later, as it would allow Messi to have some more days to recover from his midweek efforts.'", "description": "The 32-year-old has endured a frustrating campaign with a foot injury restricting him to only two starts -- a major factor in the club's slow start which has left them fourth in La Liga.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/18/19309108-0-image-a-8_1570211124862.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
