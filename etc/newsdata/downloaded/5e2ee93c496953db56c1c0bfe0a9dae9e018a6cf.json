Defense ruled. Wales made 111 tackles and Australia made 151.\n\nThe teams meet in the Rugby World Cup on Sunday in what shapes as a Pool D decider in Tokyo, and coach Michael Cheika says the game plan for his Wallabies\u2019 first northern hemisphere opposition this year won\u2019t be changing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming up against one of the best defenses in world rugby,\u201d he told reporters Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a certain amount of perseverance to be able to break that wall.\u201d\n\nAccording to Cheika, the Wallabies\u2019 plan is to try and run through that wall and not chase kicks over it. There\u2019s been a lot of kicking at the World Cup, so far, but the Australia coach is satisfied that his team kicked the ball out only 11 times against Fiji last Saturday in a 39-21 comeback win in Sapporo.\n\nAustralia\u2019s high-risk running game played into Fiji\u2019s desire for broken fields, and two-time champion Australia found itself down by nine points after halftime. Then Australia tightened up, scored two tries from rolling mauls, and the danger passed. Cheika says their running game is here to stay, however.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not big kickers of the ball. Australians like to play with the footy in hand,\u201d Cheika boasted. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be perfect all the time. That is the way we are born to play.\n\n\u201cI get it, I understand there are the tactics, kick and pressure, and all that business, but there is no guarantee that style of footy is going to win us games either. There is no one saying, \u2018Play like that and you are guaranteed victory.\u2019 There are plenty of teams that play like that and don\u2019t win.\u201d\n\nCheika said the running game \u201cis who we are and that is how we want to play footy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how I\u2019d like my young fellas to play footy and I\u2019d like the young Aussies to watch us playing like that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd maybe pass a bit better, catch a bit better.\u201d\n\nThe attempt to play more up-tempo was a philosophy the coaches asked the players to buy into this year. It has netted them four wins out of six, including one of the New Zealand All Blacks.\n\n\u201cIt has been a bit of a running joke. If we don\u201d know what we are doing then the opposition has no chance of knowing what we are doing,\u201d Cheika said. \u201cA certain amount of unpredictability is good for us, and good for the game.\u201d\n\nThe match with Fiji was also a good lesson for the 18 Wallabies at their first World Cup, Cheika added. Primarily, that World Cup matches aren\u2019t the same as normal test matches.\n\n\u201cThey got great hands-on experience,\u201d Cheika said, \u201cabout what it takes to be in the contest, and to take your opportunities when they arise.\u201d\n\nThey took them just in time in Sapporo.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When Australia and Wales last met, there were no tries.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Foster Niumata"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/japan_rugby_wcup_australia_fiji_69786_c0-312-2861-1980_s1770x1032.jpg?784dfa607f71ec4c9a728ec286fa03810d1197c0", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
