They do not understand what I have been through. There is no mental health provision. I have heard that in other camps there is psychiatric help, but not here.\u201d\n\nOne of the most high profile of the 900 Britons who left the UK to join the terror group, Ms Begum became the focus of the government\u2019s campaign to remove citizenship from British nationals who left for the caliphate.\n\nShe discovered she would not be allowed back in the UK through a journalist.\n\nThe furore around her re-entry to the UK was sparked when she said she did not regret joining the group, adding: \u201cWhen I saw my first severed head it didn't faze me at all.\u201d\n\nHowever, she has since claimed that she made the comments to protect herself and her unborn son, which she subsequently lost, from attack by her fellow prisoners.\n\nMs Begum was more recently moved to an internment camp with a focus on rehabilitation, away from the Al Hawl camp where more than 70,000 ISIS family members are reportedly being held.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Here, there are so many uncertainties about what will happen. It is still a warzone\u201d\n\nAmong camp officials there is reportedly a genuine belief that Ms Begum\u2019s views have shifted since her time in the caliphate.\n\nCudi Serbilin, a Kurdish soldier who fought Isis and now watches over detainees, told The Mail: \u201cHer mental illness is very natural because of what she went through. Her children were killed. It was a violation of human rights to recruit a 15-year-old schoolgirl here. We support her as much as we can\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cI believe she truly regrets she was once one of them. She was broken. She refuses to talk about her past. I want her to talk about her future. And give her some hope.\u201d", "description": "Isis\u00a0bride Shamima Begum\u00a0has said she\u00a0struggling with mental health issues after the death of her three children and wants to be able to stand trial in the UK.
