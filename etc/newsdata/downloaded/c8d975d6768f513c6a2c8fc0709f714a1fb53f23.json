The issuance consists of notes backed by a pool of first-ranking Australian unsecured consumer receivables, branded as 'humm', and originated by Certegy Ezi-Pay Pty Ltd (the originator), a wholly owned subsidiary of FlexiGroup Limited (flexigroup). The notes will be issued by Perpetual Corporate Trust Limited in its capacity as trustee of Flexi ABS Trust 2019-2 (the issuer). At the cut-off date 26 September 2019, the total collateral pool consisted of 89,165 receivables with an average balance of AUD2,730, totaling AUD243.4 million. The receivables are retail point-of-sale, interest-free consumer-finance loans used to finance a wide variety of products such as solar equipment (47.0% of the portfolio), home items (16.2%), jewellery (13.1%) and other items.

A greater proportion of Certegy's originations are from repeat customers with a demonstrated performance history. We assumed a WA default rate of 5.0% based on the sound performance of Certegy's previous comparable transactions and a WA default multiple of 5.0x for 'AAAsf', which reflects the default data of a benign economic period, the data's relative volatility and a higher default base case for jewellery and other items. Fitch expects stable asset performance, supported by sustained economic growth in Australia. We forecast GDP growth of 2.3% in 2020, a stable labour market and low interest rates to support the Outlook of the rated notes. Cash Flow Dynamics: Fitch completed full cash-flow modelling and determined that full and timely payment of principal and interest was made in all target rating scenarios. Structural Risk: A liquidity facility is available to ensure stable cash flow for classes A1 to E-G notes as well as trust expenses. The transaction includes fixed-rate swaps with notionals based on fixed schedules and derivative reserve accounts to trap excess spread to the extent that voluntary prepayments and defaults cause the transaction to be overhedged. Counterparty Risk: The transaction includes structural mechanisms to ensure remedial action takes place if the ratings of the swap providers or trust account bank fall below a certain level. Servicer, Operational Risks: Fitch reviewed the originator's underwriting and servicing capabilities and found that the operations of the originator and servicer were comparable with those of other consumer-finance lenders. Flexirent Capital Pty Ltd (servicer) is not rated and servicer disruption risk is mitigated via back-up arrangements. The nominated back-up servicer is illion Australia Pty Ltd, which has live access to the servicer's systems and can step in immediately upon servicer termination. RATING SENSITIVITIES Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than Fitch's base case and is likely to result in a decline in credit enhancement (CE) and remaining loss-coverage levels available to the notes. Decreased CE may make certain note ratings susceptible to negative rating action, depending on the extent of the coverage decline. Hence, Fitch conducts sensitivity analysis by stressing a transaction's initial base-case assumptions. Class: A1/A1-G/B-G/C-G/D-G/E-G Expected Rating: AAAsf/AAAsf/AA+sf/Asf/BBBsf/BB+sf Expected impact on expected rating of increased defaults: Increase defaults by 10%: AAAsf/AAAsf/AAsf/A-sf/BBB-sf/BB+sf Increase defaults by 25%: AA+sf/AA+sf/A+sf/BBBsf/BB+sf/BBsf Increase defaults by 50%: AAsf/AAsf/A-sf/BBB-sf/BBsf/B+sf Key rating drivers and expected rating sensitivities are further discussed in the corresponding presale report, \"Flexi ABS Trust 2019-2\", published today. USE OF THIRD PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G -10 Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action. DATA ADEQUACY Prior to the transaction closing, Fitch sought to receive a third-party assessment conducted on the asset portfolio information, but none was available for this transaction. As a part of its ongoing monitoring, Fitch conducted a review of a small targeted sample of the originator's files and found the information contained in the reviewed files to be adequately consistent with the originator's policies and practices and the other information provided to the agency about the asset portfolio. Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for the agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies indicates that it is adequately reliable. SOURCES OF INFORMATION The information below was used in the analysis. - Historical static loss data provided by flexigroup as of August 2019 - Loan-by-loan data provided by flexigroup at 26 September 2019 - Transaction documentation provided by Clayton Utz, the issuer's counsel.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided \"as is\" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.
