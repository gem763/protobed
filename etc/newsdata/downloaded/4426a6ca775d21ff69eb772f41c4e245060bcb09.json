The 38-year-old Wainwright is 4-0 in September, allowing one earned run in 27 innings. The 6-foot-7 right-hander pitched seven sparkling innings in a 5-1 victory over Max Scherzer and Washington on Wednesday.\n\nThe Cardinals lead Milwaukee by three games for the division, and their magic number is one to eliminate the third-place Cubs from NL Central contention after four straight one-run victories against Chicago over the weekend.\n\nRAYS THE EXPECTATIONS\n\nLefty Blake Snell starts for Tampa Bay, which goes into the final week of the regular season locked in a three-team race with Oakland and Cleveland for the two AL wild-card spots.\n\nSnell (6-7, 4.19 ERA) faces Boston at Tropicana Field in his second start since missing almost two months after surgery to remove bone chips in his throwing elbow. The 2018 AL Cy Young Award winner pitched two hitless innings in a start last Tuesday at Dodger Stadium.\n\nAILING FREEMAN\n\nBraves star Freddie Freeman is remaining in Atlanta this week for treatment on his sore right elbow, rather than traveling with the team for its series at Kansas City.\n\nFreeman, a MVP candidate for the NL East champions, left Sunday\u2019s game in the eighth inning against San Francisco after a recurrence of a bone spur in the elbow. The Braves have days off on Monday and Thursday, sandwiched around the two-game series against the Royals, giving Freeman more time to recover.\n\nFreeman is hitting .296 with 38 homers and leads the NL with 121 RBIs.\n\nFIVE FOR FIGHTING\n\nThe Nationals can slide back ahead of the Brewers for the top spot in the NL wild-card race as they open an unusual five-game series at home against Bryce Harper and the Phillies. The clubs were originally scheduled to play four times, but an extra game was added Tuesday as part of a doubleheader to make up a postponement from June.\n\nWashington dropped into a tie with Milwaukee on Sunday when its troublesome bullpen couldn\u2019t hold a two-run lead against the Marlins. The Nationals have an NL-most 29 blown saves and its relievers have combined for a major league-worst 5.83 ERA. Left-hander Patrick Corbin (13-7, 3.10) will try to improve to 4-0 against the Phillies this season. He\u2019ll start against Philadelphia right-hander Zach Eflin (9-12, 4.00).\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A look at what's happening around the majors Monday:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/nationals_cardinals_baseball_03669_c0-199-4770-2980_s1770x1032.jpg?d77a43fd01a5b699b17a61816774751ce95e1cdf", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
