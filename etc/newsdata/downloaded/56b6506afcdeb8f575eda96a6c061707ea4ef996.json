I said to them both 'all the best for the season.'\"\n\nWhen asked if that he didn't mean that for the United game, Jesus joked: \"Yes, please!\"\n\nDiscussing this season's race to claim the Premier League trophy, he added: \"This season I think it will be the same [every game] because Liverpool are five points in front of us [before Sunday's game at Old Trafford].\n\n\"We have to try to win every game.\"\n\nDefending champions City bounced back from a 2-0 home loss to Wolves to ensure they stayed within touching distance of Liverpool against Palace.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nJesus, starting just third league game of the new campaign, opened the scoring with his 50th goal for the club in the 39th minute before David Silva added a second just minutes later.\n\n\"I\u2019m very happy,\" added the Brazilian, who started just eight Premier League matches for Guardiola's side last season.\n\n\"Last season I had a difficult start to the season, so this is going to be different, I work hard and focus on the goal all the time so that\u2019s why I score a lot.\n\n\"All my life I\u2019m working hard on my pitch, when I go onto the pitch I forget everything outside. That helps me a lot.\"", "description": "Jurgen Klopp's side will be looking to continue their perfect start to the Premier League season at Old Trafford", "authors": ["Hassan Rashed", "Image", "Ian Kington Afp Via Getty Images", "Pa", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20658176.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Crystal-Palace-v-Manchester-City-Premier-League-Selhurst-Park.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
