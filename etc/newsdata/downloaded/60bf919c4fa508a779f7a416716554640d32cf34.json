Understandably, most of us pack a hobby in our carry-on to cure that in-flight case of the \u201cI\u2019m so bored I could cry\u201d.\n\nFor some of us it\u2019s a book, others might watch a movie, but for this woman, it\u2019s cross stitching an \u201cEat A Bag Of Dicks\u201d wall hanging.\n\nThe woman, who has now gone viral, was minding her own business doing her damn needlework when a fellow passenger snapped the pic of her and posted it to Facebook.\n\n\u201cI love how this lady is passing the time,\u201d the caption read.\n\nThe photo has amassed a whopping 51,000 likes, 32,000 shares and 19,000 comments in the \u201cShut The Front Door\u201d Facebook page since being posted on September 17.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Flight Diverted After Pilot Does A Big Oopsie Doopsie & Spills Coffee In Cockpit\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I really hate flying and believe that the concept of air travel should definitely eat a bag of dicks. So, with that being said, this woman is now my spirit animal.\n\nIf you think I\u2019m going to go home and cross-stitch my own \u201cEat A Bag Of Dicks\u201d wall hanging to put up in the office, you\u2019d be absolutely right.\n\nOne commenter asked the question we\u2019re all thinking: \u201cBy what magic did she get a needle onto the plane?\u201d\n\nI have personally been stopped in international customs for an undisclosed can of diet coke, so who knows how she managed to get a needle on board, but good on her. We stan a crafty queen.\n\nI feel like cross-stitching on a plane is also in the same category as knitting in a car. You probably shouldn\u2019t do any craft that could potentially leave you impaled by a sharp object while on any sort of potentially bumpy transportation.\n\nI have so many questions. Firstly, who is getting a mildly offensive needlework for Christmas? What did they do? What constitutes a handmade gift, but doesn\u2019t quite deserve a nice message? So. Many. Questions.\n\nRegardless, this woman is absolutely my 24/7 mood and I\u2019m currently searching Etsy for my own \u201cEat A Bag Of Dicks\u201d cross-stitch.\n\nPlanes are gross and terrifying. If you\u2019re not surrounded by assholes on your flight, you probably ARE the asshole on your flight. So, if a bit of needlework profanity is what\u2019s keeping this woman from snoring too loudly, reclining her seat into your legs or putting her grotty feet in the seat pocket, so be it. Let this woman live her crafty dreams.\n\nI\u2019m not sure where she was going, or where she\u2019s from. But Cross-stitch Lady, please take me with you.", "description": "A woman has gone viral on Facebook for innocently cross-stitching \"Eat A Bag Of Dicks\" on a wall hanging while onboard a flight.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-19-at-3.25.37-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
