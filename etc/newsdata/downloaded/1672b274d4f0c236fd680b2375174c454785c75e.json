To root for the home team, Trump made a rare public appearance in a city that can\u2019t stand him \u2014 one poll from 2017 showed that only 12 percent D.C. residents approve of the president \u2014 sitting in a luxury box for game 5 against the Houston Astros, surrounded by a small buffer zone made up of the First Lady and 11 Republican members of Congress.\n\nImmediately, the appearance proved why Trump\u2019s shut-in status around town has been a sound policy. (He is notorious for staying in the White House, has not attended a D.C. sports game prior to Sunday, and in two-and-a-half years, hasn\u2019t eaten at a restaurant other than the one in his own hotel.) When his face was put on the jumbotron, the Nationals Park crowd immediately erupted in boos.\n\nLook how Trump\u2019s face changes when he realizes an entire stadium is booing him pic.twitter.com/E46rzbzmbl \u2014 Arlen Parsa (@arlenparsa) October 28, 2019\n\nTo get the crowd to stop their enthusiastic dissent, it looks like the camera moved the shot away from the president and to a group of five wounded veterans also in attendance. As the fourth inning began, the D.C. crowd adapted a MAGA rally standard, chanting \u201cLock him up.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump was booed loudly by the fans at Nats Park when he was shown on the big screen.\n\nThen came a loud chant: \u201cLock him up.\u201d @wusa9 pic.twitter.com/EdqOftjqMP \u2014 Tami ~ Filthy Mouthed Wife (@tamiappleseed) October 28, 2019\n\n\"Lock him up!\" chants break out at Nationals Park, as President Trump attends the World Series on Sunday night - @albamonica pic.twitter.com/ymhzRSzhey \u2014 NBC News (@NBCNews) October 28, 2019\n\nAll heckling considered, it could have gone much worse in the city where Trump got just 4 percent of the vote in 2016. Prior to the game, Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred said that they \u201chad a conversation with him about first pitches.\u201d The president nixed it, citing concerns, according to Manfred, about \u201cfans getting into the stadium.\u201d\n\nThough Trump avoided an on-field shaming by Nats fans, he probably wasn\u2019t thrilled by the choice for the ceremonial throw: Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, the chef and restaurateur who, in 2016, bailed on his project slated for Trump International in D.C., citing the candidate\u2019s racist comments toward Mexican immigrants. Since the inauguration, he has said that Trump \u201cshould be ashamed of himself\u201d for his failure in Puerto Rico and offered free meals to furloughed workers during the government shutdown this winter. The pitch was in the dirt, but Andr\u00e9s appeared to get a standing ovation.", "description": "Donald Trump was booed at game five of the Washington Nationals first world series appearance.
