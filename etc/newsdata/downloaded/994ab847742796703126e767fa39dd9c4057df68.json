Some said Trump's refusal to answer subpoenas and provide documents could constitute an impeachable offense in and of itself as they investigate the president's dealings with Ukraine.\n\nMimi Rocah, a former federal prosecutor, questioned the thrust of Cipollone\u2019s argument \u2013 that the president wouldn\u2019t take part because he doesn\u2019t agree with the process.\n\n\u201cThis is political propaganda,\u201d Rocah said, \u201cnot real legal arguments.\"\n\nIn this 2017 photo, then-President-elect Donald Trump greets House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. More\n\nJust before the White House release, Pelosi sent House colleagues a letter protesting Trump's actions, saying the president \"is obstructing justice, abusing power and diminishing the office of the presidency.\"\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and one of the recipients of the letter, tweeted that Trump's argument boiled down to the idea that the White House would only take part in the investigations on its terms.\n\n\"They mean: the president is above the law,\" Schiff argued. \"The Constitution says otherwise.\"\n\nMore: Jimmy Carter: Trump shouldn't 'stonewall' Congress during impeachment inquiry\n\nMore: Lindsey Graham wants Rudy Giuliani to testify before Senate Judiciary on Ukraine corruption findings\n\nOther Democrats scoffed at Trump's objections, and indicated they may go to court to try and enforce subpoenas and document requests.\n\n\"Let's say it again, all together, for the slower learners: The President doesn\u2019t get to dictate how Congress investigates him,\" tweeted Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif.\n\nLet\u2019s say it again, all together, for the slower learners:\n\n\ud83d\udea8The President doesn\u2019t get to dictate how Congress investigates him.\ud83d\udea8\n\n\u2014 Eric Swalwell (@ericswalwell) October 8, 2019\n\nIn his letter, Cipollone described as a number of irregularities in the investigation, slamming Democrats for not allowing the administration to cross-examine witnesses, receive transcripts of testimony or have access to evidence. The process used by the Democrats, Cipollone argued, is an overreach of congressional authority.\n\nEchoing political arguments Trump has made on the campaign trail, Cipollone accused the Democrats of seeking \"to overturn the results of the 2016 election and deprive the American people of the President they have freely chosen.\"\n\nHe added: \u201cMany Democrats now apparently view impeachment not only as a means to undo the democratic results of the last election, but as a strategy to influence the next election, which is barely more than a year away.\u201d\n\nThe president, Cipollone wrote, \"cannot allow your constitutionally illegitimate proceedings to distract him and those in the Executive Branch from their work on behalf of the American people.\"\n\nIn discussing the letter last week, officials said Trump might demand a full House vote to authorize the impeachment inquiry. The letter itself stopped short of such a demand, but did protest the absence of a full vote as one of the unfair things about the letter.", "description": "Speaker Nancy Pelosi has accused Donald Trump of seeking to stonewall the impeachment inquiry into the president's dealings with Ukraine.", "authors": ["David Jackson", "John Fritze", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tbnuHfF5B1DCtDe5im3xMA--~B/aD0zMzA0O3c9NDY3MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/b168103d633a1880f4365e54e41247f5", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
