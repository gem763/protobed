It was an act of love and hope.\n\nOn Tuesday, 10 months after Milnes went on bended knee and offered a ring, the Belfast couple celebrated a historic change to the law.\n\n\u201cWhat a day to be gay in Northern Ireland,\u201d said Milnes, 29. \u201cWhat a day to see history happen. It\u2019s just a phenomenal feeling knowing that I will marry Christina, the love of my life, and celebrate until our feet can\u2019t hold us up any longer.\u201d\n\nSame-sex couples across Northern Ireland erupted in jubilation at the stroke of midnight on Monday when a law extending marriage equality took effect.\n\nIt was the culmination of a rollercoaster campaign to align Northern Ireland with the rest of the UK in the face of opposition from the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) and other social conservatives.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Amanda Milne, right, proposing to her partner Christina Conlon in January.

We have our guest list sorted. We can go shopping for wedding dresses knowing we\u2019re not doing anything wrong in the eyes of the law.\u201d\n\nEngland and Wales enshrined marriage equality in 2013, followed by the Republic of Ireland in 2015. Opinion polls showed a big majority favoured same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland, but the DUP blocked change at the Stormont assembly.\n\nThen in 2017, a dispute between the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in collapsed the assembly, creating a vacuum. MPs at Westminster stepped in by passing an amendment in July by a backbench Labour MP, Conor McGinn, extending marriage equality to Northern Ireland.\n\nMonday was the last chance for opponents of change to restore Stormont and avert the legislation. The DUP and others attempted a recall to block the extension of abortion rights \u2013 a far more contentious change \u2013 but the effort failed, allowing liberalisation of both marriage equality and abortion rights.\n\nJulian Smith, Northern Ireland\u2019s secretary of state, said the first gay marriage was expected the week of Valentine\u2019s day 2020.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t grow up saying \u2018I can\u2019t wait to have a civil partnership\u2019,\u201d said Cara McCann, director of Here NI, a charity that advocates for lesbian and bisexual women. \u201cYou grow up saying \u2018I want to be married\u2019. They\u2019re different things.\u201d\n\nShe and her partner Amanda McGurk, 39, had a civil partnership ceremony in Belfast in February. They plan to convert that into a marriage once guidelines are published, said McGurk. \u201cIt\u2019s validation for us.\u201d\n\nMcCann\u2019s son Ryan, 25, hailed the law change in a Facebook post. \u201cThe day my rock my mum and her amazing wife Amanda have the same rights as me and my partner.\u201d\n\nOvert homophobia has ebbed in Northern Ireland. Pride parades have grown in popularity, drawing corporate sponsors, clerics, families, politicians and police. The murder in April of Lyra McKee, a writer and LGBTQ activist who was planning to marry her partner, Sara Canning, channelled grief into demands for change.\n\nAnthony Flynn, 28, and his partner Cory Quinn, 25, celebrated the legislation with a bottle of prosecco.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cory Quinn, left, and his partner Anthony Flynn Photograph: Anthony Flynn\n\n\u201cI was incredibly cynical and sceptical of it passing right up until the last moment because we\u2019ve been pushed back so many times in the past,\u201d said Flynn, a software developer and Green party councillor. \u201cToday shows that progress can be made.\u201d\n\nAfter six years together marriage is on the cards, said Flynn. \u201cI\u2019m threatening to pop the question. Both of us come from a traditional family life where marriage is a building block in growing up. I\u2019d be a traditionalist \u2013 I want to marry the person I love and build a family around that.\u201d", "description": "As the law changed at midnight, same-sex couples celebrated the culmination of a rollercoaster campaign", "authors": ["Rory Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d36f311b050937f3f67298334e91d016698fc863/0_460_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8f03d30035e9eb528a3f5d67f71f718a", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
