But what have they collectively taught us?

One is the centrality of parliament; the other is that key aspects depend on politics, not law. Sadly, the weaknesses in such a system have now been demonstrated \u2013 by an officeholder who rejects convention and seeks to push powers to their legal limit. Suddenly, a previously stable system has shown itself to be fragile.\n\nThe biggest shock to the system was clearly Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to ask the Queen to prorogue parliament \u2013 a request seemingly made without prior agreement by the cabinet, and which was greeted with outrage by opposition parties and protests from some quarters of the public.\n\nThe prorogation undoubtedly broke with constitutional precedent. Despite Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s protestations that it was \u201croutine\u201d \u2013 at five weeks this is the longest prorogation in 90 years. The Commons was previously heading for a conference recess, but MPs were set to vote on cancelling that, and seemed likely to succeed. Johnson\u2019s move deliberately deprived them of that opportunity, as well as the right to scrutinise his government \u2013 hence demonstrating a major loophole. While MPs have a decisive role in dissolving parliament for a general election, or adjourning for a recess, prorogation lies purely in the executive\u2019s hands. This power must now be removed from the executive and handed to parliament, in line with the power to dissolve or to adjourn.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Despite Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s protestations that the prorogation was \u2018routine\u2019, at five weeks it is the longest prorogation in 90 years.\u2019 Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOther executive powers have also been brought into question this week. The Benn bill, passed against the prime minister\u2019s wishes, to require him to request an article 50 extension if no Brexit deal is agreed, was subject to various threats. One was that it might be denied royal assent \u2013 through ministers advising the Queen not to sign it into law, despite having passed through both chambers of parliament. This would be extreme action indeed, and might well have failed. But even raising such a suggestion introduces confusion, and (like prorogation) risks bringing the monarch into controversy.\n\nAnother claim was that the bill might fall prey to \u201cQueen\u2019s consent\u201d (a different and more unusual procedure than royal assent), allowing ministers to block it at an earlier stage. Such procedures are essentially ancient relics, usually of limited practical effect \u2013 but in far from \u201cnormal\u201d times, with a government intent on blocking the will of parliament, their existence becomes problematic.\n\nParliament\u2019s own more routine procedures have also been shown as wanting in key respects. The House of Commons\u2019 standing orders give the government very significant control over allocation of parliamentary time. For example, while opposition parties are guaranteed a number of days on which they can choose the topic for debate, ministers decide when those days are given \u2013 allowing them to block awkward matters from the agenda. More generally, time in the House of Commons is by default largely controlled by the government. Hence the need for MPs\u2019 repeated attempts to \u201cseize control of the agenda\u201d over Brexit \u2013 as, most recently, with the tabling of the Benn bill this week.\n\nUsually, government control of the agenda is largely unproblematic. But under a minority government it becomes highly questionable whether ministers, rather than a parliamentary majority, should decide what gets discussed. In countries such as Germany, parliamentary time is instead proportionately shared between different groups. In fragmented political times with the potential for minority governments to become more frequent, revision of the rules appears an urgent priority \u2013 to avoid the kind of unseemly procedural arguments witnessed over Brexit.\n\nAlongside all of these problems, however, this week also demonstrated one part of the constitution working exactly as it should. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act (FTPA) 2011 had been accused of toothlessness after Theresa May called an election three years early in 2017. This may have fooled Johnson into believing the age-old power by which the prime minister could decide general election dates essentially still existed \u2013 hence his attempt to bump his opponents into a \u201cpeople v parliament\u201d election. But having put down an FTPA motion for an early election he simply demonstrated how the act actually gives MPs real power. They defeated his proposal, and look set to do so again next week.\n\nThe sustainability of executive powers to prorogue, or to recommend assent to bills, depends on a political framework where long-held conventions about not abusing such power are respected. The inevitable consequence of all the strains placed on our constitution by the arrival of a prime minister prepared to flout such limits seems to be that, in due course, we will need to write down more of our rules in law. That doesn\u2019t mean a move to a written constitution \u2013 for now, at least. But it does mean creating more statute law \u2013 like the Fixed-term Parliaments Act \u2013 to constrain the government\u2019s remaining prerogative powers.\n\n\u2022 Meg Russell is professor of British and comparative politics, and director of the constitution unit at UCL.
