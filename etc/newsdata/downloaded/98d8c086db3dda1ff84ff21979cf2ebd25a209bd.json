Kepler watched over 530,000 stars for tiny dips in brightness that could be caused by a planet passing in front of the star \u2014 transits, in other words. Since then, astronomers have discovered over 4,000 exoplanets, and another 4,000-plus candidates are waiting to be confirmed with further observation.\n\nThis data has taught us that Earth-like worlds may not be so rare. In fact, planets between the sizes of Earth and Neptune seem to be the most common type in the galaxy.\n\nOne recent analysis of Kepler data estimated that 20% to 50% of stars have small, possibly rocky planets orbiting in their habitable zones \u2014 the range of distances from a star in which a planet's surface temperature could allow for liquid water. That means there could be up to 10 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy.\n\nKepler retired last year after the telescope ran out of fuel, but it has passed the planet-hunting torch to the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).\n\nHere are 16 of the exoplanets we know about so far that have the greatest potential for alien life.\n\nIn the atmosphere of super-Earth K2-18b, which is potentially habitable, scientists discovered water vapor.\n\nESA/Hubble, M. Kornmesser\n\nScientists think K2-18b is either a rocky planet like Earth or an icy planet with high concentrations of water in its interior.\n\nThe planet is much closer to its star than Earth is to the sun, but it receives only slightly more radiation because its red dwarf star is much smaller and cooler than our sun.\n\nResearchers calculated that the planet has a similar temperature to Earth \u2014 somewhere in the range of about minus 99 degrees to 116 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat planet is our \"best candidate for habitability,\" according to Angelos Tsiaras, the lead author of a paper about the finding.\n\nThat's because K2-18b is the only known planet outside our solar system with water, an atmosphere, and a temperature range that could support liquid water on its surface.\n\n\"We were extremely excited to see these results,\" Tsiaras said.\n\nHowever, the hydrogen-rich atmosphere seems to form a dense envelope of gas that would make any life on K2-18b quite different from that on Earth.\n\nRead more: Scientists have discovered water vapor on a potentially habitable super-Earth for the first time. That planet is now our best bet for finding alien life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther exoplanets could hold water, too, but more research is needed to find out for sure. Kepler-22b, for example, could be an ocean world with 60-degree-Fahrenheit temperatures.", "description": "NASA telescopes have found thousands of exoplanets, some of which could host life.
