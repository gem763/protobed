In the context of the latest scandal from her father's White House administration, it comes off as a dig at her detractors - and among those are the president himself, his personal assistant told reporters, although Trump denies it.\n\nIn a black-and-white image uploaded to her story, Tiffany posted a quote from 13th-century Persian poet Rumi about acknowledging one's self-worth despite what others may think or say. It reads: \"Study me as much as you like, you will never know me. For i differ a hundred ways from what you see me to be. put yourself behind my eyes, and see me as i see myself. Because i have chosen to dwell in a place you cant see [sic].\"\n\nTiffany Trump uploaded this image to her Instagram story on Saturday.

The New York Times reported she resigned after details from her conversation with journalists at an off-the-record dinner were published.\n\nWesterhout told reporters from The Washington Post, Bloomberg, and The Wall Street Journal after having \"a couple drinks\" that Trump doesn't like to take pictures with Tiffany, 25, because he perceives her as being overweight. She also suggested that she was closer with the president than Tiffany and his eldest daughter, Ivanka, and joked that Trump couldn't pick Tiffany out of a crowd.\n\nRead more: The glamorous life of Tiffany Trump, the president's lesser-known youngest daughter\n\nOn Friday, the president denied that claim to journalists outside the White House, saying \"Oh, no. No. Tiffany is great. I love Tiffany.\" He later tweeted the same, and said he was speaking with his daughter this weekend.\n\nHe also said that, while he would enforce a confidentiality agreement Westerhout had signed previously if necessary, he doesn't think he'll have to. \"She called me yesterday to apologize, had a bad night. I fully understood and forgave her!\" Trump tweeted on Saturday.\n\nTiffany has yet to speak publicly about the incident, but her Instagram story suggests she may be harboring some feelings of resentment toward someone who thinks poorly of her, whether that be her father, his former personal assistant, the press, or some other unknown detractor.", "description": "Tiffany Trump posted a Rumi quote about self-love in the wake of reports that her father doesn't like to take pictures with her because of her weight.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6bf7612e22af6a2d0a0447-1920-960.jpg"}
