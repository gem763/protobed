Facebook made the change after four Republican senators complained.\n\n\u201cIt is very concerning that a letter from a group of senators can silence the voices of medical and scientific experts,\u201d one of the doctors, Daniel Grossman, told BuzzFeed later in an email. \u201cThis sets a precedent where politics matter more than scientific evidence.\u201d\n\nIn an era when politicians believe they can change the course of a hurricane, it\u2019s not surprising that their medical advice overrides that of physician experts. But the facts are clear: abortion is sometimes medically necessary, as @ACOG has said.https://t.co/A9u0t9k23S \u2014 Dr. Daniel Grossman (@DrDGrossman) September 12, 2019\n\nThe fact-check contradicting the videos was presented on the website Health Feedback, which is an arm of Science Feedback, part of an international association tracking accuracy in all kinds of media. Science Feedback defines itself on its website as a \u201cworldwide network of scientists sorting fact from fiction in science-based media coverage. Our goal is to help readers know which news to trust.\u201d\n\nThe correction named various medical conditions in which an abortion is necessary to save a woman\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cWhile it is possible for early delivery to preserve both the life of the mother and child in the event of a life-threatening condition, as the video suggests, it does not mention that this is only applicable when a fetus\u2019 gestational age is advanced enough that its survival outside the womb is possible,\u201d the correction on Health Feedback said.\n\nThe two videos, presented by anti-abortion group Live Action and Live Action founder Lila Rose, remained posted, but they were marked \u201cinaccurate\u201d by Facebook last month after the fact-check. A link to the doctors\u2019 conclusion was also added by Facebook, according to a screenshot Live Action posted on Twitter. Facebook also warned that it \u201creduces the distribution of misleading content while also showing additional reporting on the same topic.\u201d\n\nBREAKING: @Facebook has rated Live Action and @LilaGraceRose\u2019s videos that state \u201cabortion is never medically necessary\u201d as FALSE.\n\n\n\nTheir 3rd-party fact-checkers?\n\n\n\nTwo ABORTIONISTS who profit from the killing of innocent children. pic.twitter.com/Dubp3qO1Ln \u2014 Live Action (@LiveAction) August 30, 2019\n\nBut the \u201cinaccurate\u201d label and link to the fact-check were removed Wednesday. That was the same day Facebook received a letter accusing the social media platform of bias against conservatives and censorship from Republican Sens. Ted Cruz (Texas), Josh Hawley (Missouri), Kevin Cramer (North Dakota) and Mike Braun (Indiana).\n\nLive Action and the Republican senators argued that the correction wasn\u2019t fair because two of the doctors were linked to reproductive rights organizations. Grossman, an obstetrics and gynecology professor at the University of California, San Francisco, is on the board of the NARAL Pro-Choice America Foundation. Dr. Robyn Schickler is a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health, a group that works to improve access to comprehensive reproductive health care.\n\n\u201cYet again, Facebook\u2019s pattern of ugly censorship has raised its ugly head,\u201d charged the senators\u2019 letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nGrossman told BuzzFeed his work \u201cdoesn\u2019t make me biased \u2014 it makes me a well-informed expert. If the question were about cardiac care, we would expect the answer to come from a well-respected cardiologist, and this should be no different.\u201d\n\nSchickler told BuzzFeed she was correcting \u201cmedical misinformation\u201d that can be \u201cincredibly harmful.\u201d She added: \u201cI\u2019ve been harassed on Twitter for stating facts and called out by senators who have political agendas. I don\u2019t have a political agenda. I\u2019m an advocate because it\u2019s part of a physician\u2019s job to advocate for the health and well-being of our patients.\u201d\n\nThe videos, meanwhile, remain on Facebook without any warning. Grossman said in a tweet that the videos should be removed during the IFCN investigation.\n\nI think it's reasonable if they want to investigate this further, but in the meantime they should take down her videos, too. They\u2019re so full of misinformation that they're really dangerous.\n\n\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t be a debate between providers and politicians. It should be about facts. https://t.co/UdoeECiomz \u2014 Dr. Daniel Grossman (@DrDGrossman) September 12, 2019", "description": "\u201cIt is very concerning that a letter from a group of senators can silence the voices of medical and scientific experts,\u201d said a doctor who flagged the fa...", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7af54b240000c92b78f08f.jpeg?cache=fkmwidnpme&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
