No president, not even Ronald Reagan, had as much support within the party as President Trump does.\u201d\n\nLast year\u2019s election saw Democrats victorious after a blue wave elected dozens of members in conservative-leaning districts.\n\nNow, Republicans are eyeing 31 of those new seats that the president won in 2016, 13 of which he held by a margin of six points or more, as a path to victory of their own in a presidential election year with Mr. Trump back on the ticket.\n\n\u201cI not only think President Trump is going to carry those 31, but much more,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said.\n\nTheir optimism was boosted after two victories last week in North Carolina special elections gave Republicans two new congressmen \u2014 Dan Bishop and Greg Murphy.\n\nThe president praised their efforts to reach out to their communities and drive up enthusiasm, and promised to campaign for future races in 2020.\n\n\u201cI am going to stop at every community that I can. We are going to make a list of 50 or so,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI got a lot of energy that\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nAddressing the conference Friday, Vice President Mike Pence gave the Republican lawmakers the task of spreading the president\u2019s agenda as the 2020 election picks up steam.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s time for us to tell our story,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best is yet to come. We\u2019ve got to put out that positive message.\u201d\n\nHe urged them to remind voters of their past accomplishments, such as the 2017 tax cuts and increased funding for the military, while promoting Mr. Trump\u2019s goals for the future, including implementing immigration reform, passing the USMCA trade deal, and establishing Space Force as a new branch of the military.\n\nThis kind of messaging is vital, the vice president said, as Democrats embrace increasingly liberal priorities.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s not going to be enough for us just to win the next election. We gotta win the next generation,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans also plan to argue that Democrats don\u2019t have a record to run on, since they have spent all their time on investigations instead of legislation.\n\nMr. McCarthy called the Democrats\u2019 mixed messaging on impeachment an \u201cembarrassment\u201d and said the emphasis they\u2019ve put on investigating Mr. Trump will spell trouble for them in 2020.\n\n\u201cTell me, how are Democrats going to go back and ask for reelection on what they have achieved?\u201d He said. \u201cAll they have achieved is investigations that have gone nowhere.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. McCarthy said, Republicans can contrast their agenda with Democrats socialist policies.\n\nMr. McCarthy gave a long list of issues his party plans running on, including pushing for stronger border laws and the continued high cost of health care.\n\nRegarding health care, Republican leadership slammed Democrats for pushing Medicare for All, and vowed to refine their 2017 replacement for Obamacare and pursue solutions to issues such as surprise billing.\n\nThey also pushed back on what they see as ineffective, unrealistic environmental plans from Democrats, such as the push to put the U.S. back into the Paris Agreements and the Green New Deal.\n\nRather, Mr. McCarthy said Republicans would look to address the ocean\u2019s plastic problem without banning straws and provide private companies with the incentives to clean the environment. He highlighted a bill from freshman Rep. Dan Crenshaw that would provide grants for companies to extract carbon dioxide from the air.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
