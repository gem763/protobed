It features an ad without a key feature: The logo.\n\n\u201cTruthfully, you don\u2019t need more than five seconds to nail this because it\u2019s so iconic,\u201d branding expert and founder of global advertising platform BigEyedWish, Ian Wishingrad told YFi PM.\n\nLooking to appeal to a generation that steers away from consumer sales pitches, Frito-Lay recently unveiled an ad \u2014 minus the brand \u2014 to appeal to under-21 consumers turned off by advertising.\n\nThe demographic known as Generation Z has grown up mostly using ad-free platforms like Netflix (NFLX). \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about Gen Z, they don\u2019t watch long format TV in this respect,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd while the viewers will see clues throughout the ad, such as the orange dust the snack leaves on your fingers and the chips triangular shape, the word \u201cDoritos\u201d is never shown.\n\nGen Z \u201cis different as every other generation as we are from Baby Boomers. There\u2019s no antipathy towards brands, they just need to communicate in the right way to the right consumer,\u201d Wishingrad said.\n\nA Dorittos truck hauling cargo north on the Queen Elizabeth II Highway near Red deer, Alberta.

He compared it to a TV commercial, rather than a digital branding campaign that often resonates better.\n\n\u201cJust the act itself was the right move to do,\u201d he said. \u201cDo it, don\u2019t tell people you\u2019re doing it.\u201d\n\nMcKenzie DeGroot is a producer at Yahoo Finance.
