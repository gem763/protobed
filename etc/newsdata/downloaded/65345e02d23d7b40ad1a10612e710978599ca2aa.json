In 2017, homelessness had increased for the first time in seven years. On a single night last year, more than half a million Americans lacked permanent shelter, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nA significant number of people staying in sheltered locations in January 2018 \u2013 about 4,000 \u2013 were likely displaced by presidentially declared national disasters, including Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate.\n\nThe problem of homelessness is at its root a problem of affordable housing. According to statistics compiled by the National Alliance to End Homelessness, 11 million low-income households spend half or more of their annual income on housing. As housing prices \u2013 especially in large cities \u2013 continue to rise faster than incomes, more people are likely to become homeless.\n\nHousehold income: States with the highest and lowest averages; Maryland leads the way, data shows\n\nNight life: The night economies of America's biggest cities\n\nThere are serious health risks associated with homelessness, which increases exposure to weather and disease. Homelessness can also lead to \u2013 and is often accompanied by \u2013 untreated medical issues, mental illness, social isolation, and increased risk of substance use disorders.\n\nWhile the number of families with children experiencing homelessness declined between 2017 and 2018, a large share of the country\u2019s homeless population are children. More than 180,000 people in families with children and approximately 36,000 individuals under 25 experienced homelessness.\n\nAmong the myriad of government anti-poverty programs is the Continuum of Care Program, which was designed by HUD to promote community efforts across the nation to end homelessness. Federal funds are dispersed through these jurisdictions to the communities they contain \u2013 cities, counties, and sometimes entire states.\n\nUsing data provided by HUD, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the estimated total number of individuals experiencing homelessness in the 48 HUD jurisdictions (Continuums of Care) representing the 50 largest cities in America. City population data is for the city proper and came from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2018 American Community Survey. Cities are ranked by total population, in ascending order.\n\nTo identify the cities with the most unsheltered homeless people, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed data from the 2018 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) for the 48 Continuums of Care (CoC) identified as major cities. The CoCs identified as major cities with the highest percentage of their overall homeless population that is unsheltered were considered the cities with the most unsheltered homeless people. The AHAR defines CoCs as \u201clocal planning bodies responsible for coordinating the full range of homelessness services in a geographic area, which may cover a city, county, metropolitan area, or an entire state.\u201d\n\nHomeless populations for each CoC are estimated during one night in the last week of January each year. Shelters include emergency shelters, transitional housing programs, safe havens, rapid re-housing programs, permanent supportive housing programs, and other permanent housing programs. The percentage of homeless people in families, in families with children, and the level of chronic homelessness \u2013 individuals who have been homeless for one year or more \u2013 also came from the HUD. Total population for the city proper is from the 2017 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates. All other data is from the 2018 AHAR report.\n\nKansas City, Mo.
