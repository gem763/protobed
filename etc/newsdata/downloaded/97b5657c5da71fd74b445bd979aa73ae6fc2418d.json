They also said it was a way to ensure that contractors weren\u2019t harassed while working.\n\nThis facility behind us is not a victory for Planned Parenthood, it is a sign of desperation. \u2014 Mary Kate Knorr, executive director of Illinois Right to Life\n\nNews of the clinic came after Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker in June signed a bill into law that established a woman\u2019s \u201cfundamental right\u201d to abortion. He campaigned on making the state the most progressive in the country regarding abortion rights.\n\nCLICK TO VISIT THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nState Rep. Avery Bourne, R-Raymond, spoke to the protesters Wednesday about the passing of the law, calling it the \"consequence of elections,\" the News-Democrat reported.\n\n\"They wanted Illinois to be an abortion destination in the Midwest...What they wanted in the general assembly was for taxpayers like us to have to pay for abortions,\" Bourne said.\n\nAs protesters stood behind an iron fence with signs that said \u201cPlanned Parenthood hurts women,\u201d \u201cStop Abortion Now\u201d and \u201cShut them down,\u201d a worker continued painting the facility\u2019s parking lot, according to the paper. It is expected to open as soon as next week.\n\nFox News' Caleb Parke contributed to this report.", "description": "A soon-to-be-opened\u00a0Illinois\u00a0Planned Parenthood clinic\u00a0that was built in secret has sparked protests from anti-abortion\u00a0demonstrators who call the clandestine construction\u00a0\u201can embarrassment\u201d and \u201csign of desperation.\u201d", "authors": ["Stephen Sorace", "Mary Kate Knorr", "Executive Director Of Illinois Right To Life"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/03/694940094001_6091535104001_6091516728001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
