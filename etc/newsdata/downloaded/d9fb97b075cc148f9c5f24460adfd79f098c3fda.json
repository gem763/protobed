(Michael Dwyer/Associated Press)\n\nWhen the bullet struck David Ortiz in the back, he felt a burning sensation, he said, then life turned into a nightmare.\n\nPatrons seated around him, including his friends, at a trendy bar in the Dominican capital Santo Domingo scattered at the sound of the gunshot. Ortiz tried to get up and run, too, but fell to the ground injured. He lay there alone bleeding on the floor.\n\n\u201cThen this angel comes out of nowhere,\u2019\u2019 he told the Boston Globe on Saturday, his first interview with an English language publication since he was shot June 9.\n\nIt was Eliezer Salvador, another patron. He helped Ortiz to his Rolls-Royce then drove him to a hospital. When doctors wheeled Ortiz into the operating room, Salvador was left holding Ortiz\u2019s bloody clothes and his diamond-crusted jewelry.\n\nSince the shooting, Ortiz has dealt with three surgeries, a near-fatal bacterial infection and psychological wounds that the gregarious \u201cBig Papi\u201d says he still endures.\n\n\u201cPeople need to understand, this isn\u2019t a movie where you get shot in the street and you\u2019re back two minutes later,\u201d Ortiz told the Globe. \u201cNo, I got shot and almost died. I only have one life to live. I can\u2019t just go to the pharmacy and buy another one.\u201d\n\nOrtiz was shot once at close range. The bullet ripped through his torso and damaged his intestines, gallbladder and liver. Doctors at a hospital operated for six hours to save Ortiz\u2019s life. When he returned to the United States and Massachusetts General Hospital, he went almost immediately into a second surgery.\n\nBut three weeks later, an acute bacterial infection ravaged his digestive system. He shook with fever and required yet another surgery.\n\n\u201cIt was very dangerous,\u2019\u2019 Ortiz told the Globe. \u201cI got to the point that I started losing hope.\u2019\u2019\n\nFor seven weeks, he couldn\u2019t keep food down, and received nourishment through feeding tubes. He could swallow only ice chips. His mouth ached, it was so dry.\n\n\u201cI had nightmares all the time about being in the desert, looking for water,\u201d he said. \u201cI would wake up with my mouth dry and feeling like I\u2019m going to die.\u201d\n\nHe awoke from a nightmare one day to see his sister seated at his bedside with her Bible open. Ortiz told the Globe she was \u201carguing with God, asking for help.\u201d But several days later, his condition improved. He ate his first meal \u2014 a bowl of soup \u2014 and returned home a couple weeks later.\n\nFriends from around Major League Baseball \u2014 from the Yankees, Phillies and, of course, Red Sox \u2014 visited and called to check on him.\n\nBut the former slugger\u2019s mind remains fixed on why he was shot.\n\nThe attack, according to Dominican officials, was a professional hit intended for Ortiz\u2019s friend, Sixto David Fernendez. The two were seated near one another the night of the shooting. As Ortiz recovered, speculation spread about why someone would try to kill one of baseball\u2019s living legends and one of the Dominican Republic\u2019s favorite sons.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t why I was involved in something like this because I\u2019m not the type of person who looks for trouble or causes trouble. All I worry about is trying to help people, about trying to do the right thing,\u201d Ortiz said.\n\nSeveral suspects have been arrested in connection with the attack, including the alleged mastermind, Ortiz said he doesn\u2019t know of any of them.\n\nHe hired former Boston police commissioner Ed Davis last month to investigate the shooting. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit around and chill if there\u2019s somebody out there who wants to kill me,\u201d Ortiz said.\n\nOrtiz said he feels good now three months after the shooting. He is thinner after losing 40 pounds in the hospital, but regaining some weight. In a number of weeks, he plans to leave Boston for Los Angeles and resume his job as Fox Sports baseball analyst. He dropped his daughter off at college late in August and threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Fenway Park on Monday. He expects to make a full physical recovery by Thanksgiving.\n\nBut psychologically, he said he can feel himself withdrawing from social situations.\n\n\u201cI like to embrace people, make them feel comfortable around me,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cI was always very accessible, but I think I\u2019m going to cut down on that a little now.\n\n\u201cOne lesson I\u2019ve learned is that you can\u2019t be naive. There are a lot of things going on now that you have to be aware of. I need to pay attention and be more careful.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nNationals\u2019 Kurt Suzuki slowly making his way back, as Raudy Read gets a shot behind the plate\n\nGeorgia fans organize last-minute \u2018pink-out\u2019 to honor Arkansas State coach\u2019s late wife\n\nVirginia is surging, FSU is reeling entering ACC matchup turned upside-down", "description": "Former Red Sox slugger says he expects to be fully recovered by Thanksgiving, but psychological scars remain.", "authors": ["Jacob Bogage", "National Sports Writer", "September At Pm", "Jacob Bogage Writes About Sports For The Post", "Where He Has Worked Since He Previously Covered The Automotive", "Manufacturing Industries For The Business Section."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/89I30S-U8rFU_uZSolX6QpINGEk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JGHBOAGTOAI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
