The following five places are sure to delight photography fans, couples, those with families, and nature lovers alike.\n\n\u00a9 Photo by pepe.1081\n\nRyujinotsuribashi, or Ryujin Big Suspension Bridge, is a 375-meter long bridge over a man-made lake in Ryujin Gorge, in Hitachi-ota, Ibaraki. It\u2019s strictly a pedestrian bridge, with glass panels in the floor in some spots, allowing visitors to check out the rushing waters of Ryujin River just below their feet. Famed for its 100-meter high bungee jump attraction, this bridge is also an excellent place to look out at the autumn foliage. There\u2019s also a nearby park, hiking courses, and hot spring to enjoy as well.\n\nBonus for couples visiting this bridge, there is a carillon at one end with three wooden bells, known as the bell of love, the bell of hope, and the bell of happiness. These bells will only ring when their switches are pushed by two people simultaneously.\n\nAfter scaring yourself silly with the heights and maybe some bungee jumping, you\u2019ll probably be feeling pretty hungry. Hitachi soba noodles are renowned nationwide for its rich taste and firmness. You\u2019ll find soba restaurants practically everywhere you go, but if you want something truly homemade tasting, head to one of the smaller, less touristy shops.\n\nWhere: 2133-6 Keganocho, Hitachiota, Ibaraki\n\nWhen to go: Throughout November\n\nRecommended for: Couples, adrenaline junkies\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Shreya Matkar \ud83c\udf91 (@_japanophile_) on Oct 5, 2019 at 11:08am PDT\n\nA large natural gorge in Takahagi City, Hananuki Gorge is best known for its numerous waterfalls that cascade into a series of basins. There are also other dams and streams here, as well as plenty of walking trails and walkways to discover. A particular highlight of this gorge is Shiomidaki Tsuribashi, a 60-meter long suspension bridge that offers absolutely amazing views of the landscape around you.\n\nMost visitors wait until mid-November when the fall colors are at their peak to visit, so if you want to avoid the crowds, visiting earlier might be for the best.\n\nWhere: Ono, Takahagi, Ibaraki\n\nWhen to go: Mid to late November\n\nRecommended for: Anyone with a camera, nature lovers\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Japan Rail Pass (@jrailpass) on Oct 19, 2018 at 5:30am PDT\n\nIf you end up missing the fall foliage and visit in the winter, you won\u2019t be disappointed either. Once the weather gets truly cold, the falls freeze solid, creating a towering pillar of pure white ice.\n\nFukuroda Falls is also known as a lover\u2019s sanctuary, as there is a statue dedicated to lovers around the world here, which is a popular photography spot for couples.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for souvenirs of your time in the Daigo area, my personal favorite Daigo urushi, or lacquerware. Produced not that far from Fukuroda Falls, the town of Daigo is home to Japan\u2019s second-highest lacquer output, and where you\u2019ll find beautiful sake cups, vases, chopsticks, tableware and even keychains in rich, glossy shades of red, brown, and black.\n\nWhere: 3-19 Fukuroda, Daigo, Kuji, Ibaraki\n\nWhen to go: Early to mid-November\n\nRecommended for: Couples, families, photography fanatics\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by \u3055\u304d (@ss__mgram) on Sep 28, 2019 at 3:10am PDT\n\nLocated on a hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean, Oarai Isosaki Shrine was first founded in 856 when the deity Sukunahikona-no-mikoto descended on the shore of Oarai. It has been home to a permanent shrine and a spot of worship since 1730. Three torii gates are included within its properties, but the most well-known (and photographed) of the bunch is the Kamiiso no Torii, which stands on a reef in the Pacific Ocean. This spot is said to be where the deity landed.\n\nThe shrine itself is surrounded by beautiful woods that transform into all the warm colors of autumn each year, which is reason enough to visit, but those with a love of the obscure may also want to visit the Oarai Sea Museum. There, visitors can learn about the history of the fishing industry and the integral part it has played in the history and worship of the area.\n\nThis is also a great area to try one of Ibaraki\u2019s most famous seasonal dishes in. In the late fall and winter, anko (anglerfish) hot pot is a common dish in Ibaraki prefecture. Rich in collagen, this deepsea fish is typically served in a nabe style hot pot with fresh winter vegetables like hakusai (Chinese cabbage) and green onions.\n\nWhere: 6890 Isohamacho, Oarai, Higashiibaraki, Ibaraki\n\nWhen to go: Throughout November\n\nRecommended for: Anyone who\u2019s missing the ocean views\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Jordan Holland (@jordan_holland_photos) on Jun 25, 2019 at 4:57am PDT\n\nAlongside Kenrokuen in Ishikawa prefecture and Korakuen in Okayama prefecture, Kairakuen is one of Japan\u2019s Three Great Gardens. The newest of the three, Kairakuen was originally completed in 1841 by the regional lord Tokugawa Nariaki, and designed not only for his enjoyment but for that of the public as well. As the story goes, Lord Nariaki opened the garden to the public because he saw little difference between the classes\u2014in fact, the name \u2018Kairakuen\u2019 means \u2018park to be enjoyed together.\u2019\n\nThere is a bamboo grove, a cedar forest, tea ceremony rooms, plum trees, cherry trees, azaleas, wisteria, and beautiful views of Lake Senba as well. This park is breathtaking all year round, so if you aren\u2019t able to visit in the fall, late winter is also highly recommended. There are 3,000 plum trees made up of some 100 different varieties within the grounds, which fill the park with brilliant pink and white petals from late January onward.\n\n\u00a9 Photo by eri_oshiro\n\nWhile you\u2019re in this area, be sure to stop by one of the many artisan shops to get a piece of Kasama-yaki to remember your trip by. A type of pottery from the Edo period, Kasama-yaki is a highly unique, very stylized form of pottery that many still consider one of the best arts to come from that era.\n\nWhere: 1 Tokiwacho, Mito, Ibaraki\n\nWhen to go: Mid to late November\n\nRecommended for: Families, nature lovers, pottery fans\n\nIf you want to immerse yourself in the beautiful colors of fall and really see a different side of Japan, then a visit to Ibaraki is a must!\n\nDid we miss any of your favorite spots to visit during the fall in Ibaraki?
