Ten years before that, I was just trying to figure out how to move forward with my life. I had entered my 20s, and despite everything that had happened, I was open to dating. At the same time, I didn\u2019t see the point in getting involved romantically with someone I knew I couldn\u2019t stay with forever, and the right person had yet to come along.\n\nThat changed when I met Jacob in 2008. We\u2019d met online through a mutual friend, who\u2019d shown Jacob my blog. We quickly began discussing current events, beliefs, life goals and ambitions, developing a rich friendship despite never having met or even seen photos of each other. We exchanged over 900 pages of emails, yet always had more to talk about. When he made it clear that his desire was to prayerfully consider transitioning into a serious relationship, I was cautiously optimistic. He didn\u2019t want to pressure me, but he also had no intention of leaving me wondering and unsure, and I was grateful for that.\n\nA week before we met in person for the first time, I thought eagerly about all the questions I had, everything I wanted to know about who Jacob was and how we would navigate being together, if we decided to move in that direction. There was the distance between us (he lived in Canada, I lived in Michigan) and whether one or the other of us would be willing to move if things progressed, for starters. And . . . that. I\u2019d have to tell him about that. Even to myself, I still used euphemisms. Words that I rarely let myself think, I would now have to speak out loud.\n\nI could wait, I argued with myself, wanting a way out. No, you really can\u2019t. This is going to affect a lot, I reminded myself. He\u2019s going to have to know.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

If Jacob didn\u2019t understand, he might add to the lies about it being my fault that I heard in my head every day, and that would be crushing. I could barely fight the war within myself. I had no ability, nor any desire, to start a relationship where I\u2019d have to fight those ideas with the person I let closest to me. You have to know if he can handle it, I told myself firmly. If he can\u2019t, there\u2019s no point in going any further. There wasn\u2019t a choice.\n\nHow do I even start that conversation? I wondered, feeling ill.\n\nIn the two years prior, I\u2019d journaled extensively at my mother\u2019s suggestion, despite my inner protestations. I wrote mostly in pencil, which gave me the freedom to erase and hide whatever I put down. Preparing for this conversation with Jacob, I sat down in my room and flipped through my old entries. Memories flooded me as I wrestled with how and what to communicate.\n\nHow could I explain to someone the confusion, the sick feeling and the unnamed shame that swirled through my mind? How could I explain to someone who has never been that vulnerable that even though I wasn\u2019t \u201cheld down,\u201d I was still trapped? Even though I wasn\u2019t \u201cphysically overpowered,\u201d I was completely powerless? I can\u2019t forget any detail.\n\nTwo years earlier, I had stumbled across a news special on childhood sexual assault. It put words to what I had never understood \u2014 why I hadn\u2019t been able to move or speak during the abuse. There weren\u2019t just two responses to danger \u2014 fight or flight \u2014 as everyone casually said. There were three: fight, flight or freeze. When I heard that, I recognized my own experience. I know what freezing in fear is. It\u2019s when you\u2019re so confused and ashamed and horrified and scared that you just shut down, because reality is incomprehensible.\n\nHow could I even begin to let someone get close after that? I\u2019d journaled through the trust paradox, too, the one that twists the truth and makes a victim feel like she\u2019s at fault: Because I trusted, I gave the benefit of the doubt. If I hadn\u2019t trusted Nassar enough to let him get close, if I hadn\u2019t trusted enough to believe he wouldn\u2019t hurt me, it never would have happened. If he hadn\u2019t known I trusted, he never would have done it. It\u2019s my fault. I gave him the power to damage me when I gave him my trust.\n\nFor years, I had promised myself that no one would ever know what happened to me, ignoring the reality that someday, someone might have to. How much room could I leave for Jacob if he didn\u2019t understand but was willing to learn? I was steeling myself to be devastated by his reaction, even if he had good intentions.\n\nAs I stacked the loose collection of journal entries to put them back in their folder, another old entry slipped out. I\u2019d titled it \u201cSilent Battle.\u201d It was page after page of my attempt to find words that could explain the internal war that rages within a victim when her abuser\u2019s actions don\u2019t match the person he was supposed to be to her. It was also my attempt to answer the resounding question I heard so often: Why didn\u2019t you tell someone? Re-reading my writing, I felt exhausted. I feared this painful line of questioning would be the conversation that was coming, because it was the one I couldn\u2019t get out of my own head.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you cry out? He probably would have stopped if you had. In fact, if he thought you would, it probably wouldn\u2019t have happened at all. Why didn\u2019t you cry out?\n\nWhy? Because I trusted. I was a child. He was a doctor. He knows best. He had cared for me. He knew me. There had to be a reason. I must be reading too much into it. It isn\u2019t fair to assume he was being sexual. Think about who he is. Give the benefit of the doubt. I must be the one with the dirty mind if I can even think something like that.\n\nTerror. Shame. Confusion. Shattered trust. Humiliation. Horror. Revulsion. Dirty. Used.\n\nHow could you not cry out?\n\nI didn\u2019t know.\n\nFoolish. How could you not know?\n\nBecause I trusted.\n\nIt\u2019s over.\n\nBut it\u2019s not done.\n\nYou didn\u2019t cry out.\n\nI did inside.\n\nIs that enough?\n\nI inhaled sharply, closed the folder with a snap and quickly shut the light off. There was no point in thinking about how Jacob might answer that unspoken question. I couldn\u2019t change it. All I could do was live with the fallout.\n\nThat was a decade ago. What I didn\u2019t know then was that the man walking into my life would become my greatest earthly source of healing, hope and comfort.\n\nJacob stood against every dynamic that a warped understanding of masculinity has created in our world. He was sacrificing instead of demanding, respectful instead of self-serving, protective rather than destructive. He eschewed what he called a \u201cporn mindset\u201d \u2014 the idea that sex and women are tools of men\u2019s gratification. He could understand the damage that had been done to me, and speak truth to the lies that flooded my soul, because he understood women\u2019s equality and agency long before meeting me. He came into our relationship knowing that truly fulfilling intimacy is about loving each other well.\n\nSo when I told Jacob what happened to me, he immediately understood why the damage was significant and real. It had to be \u2014 sexual assault is an attack on a person\u2019s sense of self. He knew that my vulnerability needed to be protected and respected. I never had to question whether he thought my abuse was my fault; he came right out with that assurance unprompted, and he reminded me over and over again. He was able to do all the right things for me because he thought all the right things; he saw the situation for what it was.\n\nJacob showed me how a partner could gently and patiently walk beside me through my healing without ever making demands, without placing blame on me when I struggled, without impatience. His values and priorities stood against a culture that asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal?\u201d He took on my pain as his own, showed me that he could stand in grief with me, that we could be a team, even as I took the lead. And because of this, one of my greatest fears \u2014 telling a future partner about my abuse \u2014 became instead a source of incredible healing.\n\nAdapted from What Is a Girl Worth: My Story of Breaking the Silence and Exposing the Truth about Larry Nassar and USA Gymnastics by Rachael Denhollander, releasing from Tyndale House Publishers Sept. 10, 2019.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Rachael Denhollander, the first woman to publicly accuse Larry Nassar, writes about her experience sharing her trauma with a potential new partner in an excerpt from her new book.", "authors": ["Rachael Denhollander"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/rachael-denhollander-new-book.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
