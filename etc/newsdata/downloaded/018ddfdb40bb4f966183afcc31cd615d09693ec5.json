SoftBank had invested $2 billion in WeWork in January at a reported valuation of $47 billion. But WeWork's valuation was dramatically slashed, sources told Faber last week, as demand for the IPO was not there.\n\nThe We Co. is the formal parent company of WeWork. Founded in 2010 by CEO Adam Neumann, the company rents out work spaces to start-ups and other businesses.\n\nWeWork's planned IPO has drawn many questions from Wall Street, especially due to a controversial remittance for Neumann. In July, the We Co. paid Neumann $5.9 million in a stock transaction for the trademark to \"We.\" After the payment drew attention from critics, Neumann returned the stock last week, with the company explaining that the change was \"at Adam's direction.\" The trademark is the property of We Holdings LLC, which is an investment vehicle of Neumann and co-founder Miguel McKelvey.\n\nThe company has over 500 locations, with plans to open nearly 170 new locations.
