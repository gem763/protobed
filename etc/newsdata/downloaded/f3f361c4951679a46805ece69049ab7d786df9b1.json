What happened should be considered sedition and a crime which cannot be tolerated,\u201d President Salih said during a national address on Monday.\n\nSalih denounced the use of lethal ammunition against protesters and reminded security forces they have a responsibility to protect all citizens.\n\n\u201cThe right to protest and freedom of expression are guaranteed by the Iraqi constitution,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cOur armed forces which have protected the country and the people in the most serious confrontations with terrorism, are also capable of protecting citizens and their peaceful democratic practices in conditions of peace,\u201d he said. \u201cThey must firmly confront those who violated the constitution by attacking citizens and the security forces, and terrorizing the media.\u201d\n\nSalih promised a full inquiry into the use of force against protesters. The Iraqi military admitted on Monday that \u201cexcessive force\u201d was used and promised to \u201chold accountable those commanding officers who carried out these wrong acts.\u201d\n\nSalih also spoke about reorganizing the Iraqi government, implementing reforms against corruption, and fixing what the protesters regard as a broken electoral system.\n\nMonday night was exceptionally violent because protests spread into Sadr City, a district of Baghdad noted for poverty, poor infrastructure, political unrest, and a maze of narrow alleys that complicates the task of security forces. Many of Sadr City\u2019s residents are loyal to Moqtada al-Sadr, an influential cleric who has called for the government in Baghdad to step down.\n\nTuesday brought some hopeful signs of renewed stability in Baghdad as the central \u201cGreen Zone,\u201d where many government offices and foreign embassies are located, was reopened after two days and Internet service was restored.\n\nThe government said Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi held productive meetings with protest leaders over the weekend, after which \u201cthe situation stabilized and life returned to normal\u201d around the Green Zone.\n\nThe government of Iran did what it could to destabilize the situation, denouncing the protesters as saboteurs manipulated by foreign parties into undermining the close relationship between Tehran and the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad, as reported by Al Jazeera on Tuesday:\n\nA string of Iranian officials have since come out with statements accusing their country\u2019s arch-foes of being behind the unrest. \u201cEnemies seek to sow discord but they\u2019ve failed & their conspiracy won\u2019t be effective,\u201d supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was quoted as saying on his office\u2019s Twitter account. \u201cIran and Iraq are two nations whose hearts & souls are tied together\u2026This bond will grow stronger day by day,\u201d it said. State news agency IRNA said the supreme leader was reacting to the violence in Iraq. The official news agency weighed in with its own commentary, accusing the US, Saudi Arabia and Israel of stirring the Iraqi protests in order to spoil Iran\u2019s ties with Iraq and Syria. \u201cUnprecedented protests in Iraqi cities\u2026 show that some forces inside and outside of the region are seriously concerned about the closeness and cooperation\u201d of Baghdad, Tehran and Damascus, it added.\n\nAn Iranian government spokesman on Monday dismissed the protesters as \u201cill-wishers who seek to sabotage any opening between us and those neighbors who have had differences of opinions in recent years\u201d and advised the Iraqi people to \u201cshow more self-restraint.\u201d\n\nOther Iranian officials insinuated the protests were part of a plot to disrupt a major Shiite pilgrimage, the annual 40-day period of mourning for the Shiite\u2019s revered Imam Hussein Ali, who was killed in the Iraqi city of Karbala in the 7th Century. The Iranians accused \u201cseditionists\u201d of attempting to \u201covershadow\u201d the pilgrimage and claimed to have evidence the protests were orchestrated as an attack on the Shiite religion by the United States, Israel, and the Sunni kingdom of Saudi Arabia.", "description": "Iraqi President Barham Salih on Monday condemned violence against protesters and journalists during demonstrations across the country.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1170806546-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
