He was also very friendly. Soon, I would discover just how friendly,' she told 9Honey.\n\nA woman has spoken about how her personal trainer made her feel uncomfortable during their sessions by being too 'touchy feely' (stock image)\n\nShe said when she showed up for her first session, Aaron was attentive and 'seemed to know what he was doing'.\n\nImportantly, she said he understood she was quite unfit and needed to ease herself back into a routine.\n\nThe woman added his friendly manner helped her to feel under his guidance it wouldn't take long to get in shape - nor would he pressure her in any way.\n\nWhile her second session also went well, she said she'd started to notice her trainer had become quite 'touchy-feely'.\n\nThe woman said he'd rub his hand up and down her thighs as a way of 'explaining' which exercise was best for her legs, always lingering a little longer than was necessary.\n\nOn top of this, Aaron had also started calling her by more affectionate and intimate names, referring to her as 'gorgeous', 'beautiful' and 'sexy'.\n\nThis wasn't a liberty she said he'd take with others he trained, noting males he worked with were only referred to as 'mate'.\n\nWhat types of behaviours are considered sexual harassment? * Staring, leering or unwelcome touching * Suggestive comments or jokes * Unwanted invitations to go out on dates or requests for sex * Intrusive questions about a person's private life or body * Unnecessary familiarity, such as deliberately brushing up against a person * Emailing pornography or rude jokes * Displaying images of a sexual nature around the workplace * Communicating content of a sexual nature through social media or text messages Source: Humanrights.org.au\n\nDespite feeling uncomfortable with the attention, the woman said she didn't have the courage to ask Aaron to stop.\n\nThings took a turn for the worse after her trainer asked her to step outside at the end of their third session under the guise of wanting to 'talk' to her.\n\nInstead, of discussing her progress as she expected, he announced she was doing 'really well' before grabbing her in a bear hug and kissing her twice on the cheek.\n\nAlthough she was stunned by what had happened, she said all she could do was say a quick thank you before heading to her bus stop.\n\nThe woman said her biggest regret was not having the courage to call out her trainer over his inappropriate behaviour (stock image)\n\nAfter speaking with her husband, who suggested she tell him he needed to respect her personal space, she decided to give Aaron one more chance.\n\n'When I was lifting weights, he stood closely behind me and put his hands on my hips, pressing himself very closely against me,' she said.\n\nAfter she finished her session, he followed her outside, to hug her again and tell her her that her 'husband was a lucky man'.\n\nShe said this last encounter, which also saw Aaron try to kiss her, was the final straw and she decided on the spot to leave the gym as a way to end the awkward situation.\n\nWhile today she has found a new female trainer to work with, she said her greatest regret situation was not having the courage to ask him to stop.\n\n'I should have asked him to stop touching me so much, and told him hugging and kissing me made me feel uncomfortable,' she said.\n\n* Names have been changed.", "description": "An Australian woman has revealed how her personal trainer started acting in a sleazy manner during their workout sessions.
