Bridenstine\u2019s comments essentially took 2019 off the table for this to happen, with the administrator saying he was \u201cvery confident that in the first part of next year, we will be able to launch American astronauts on American rockets,\u201d and that if \u201ceverything goes according to plan,\u201d it would take place in the first quarter of 2020.\n\nMusk noted that in order for SpaceX to have confidence in its Crew Dragon launch system\u2019s reliability for a crewed mission they would have to have run 10 successful drop tests using the newly developed Mark 3 parachute system for the capsule \u201cin a row.\u201d Bridenstine said that based on the current schedule, SpaceX could run as many as 10 drop tests total using the Mark 3 system between now and the end of this year.\n\nThis new Mark 3 system features much stronger lines connecting the sheets of material used in their construction, Musk said, thanks to switching away from nylon to a material called \u201cxylon,\u201d which is three or more times stronger, per the CEO. The new version also uses a new stitching pattern compared to Mark 2 for additional strength.\n\nBoth Musk and Bridenstine were keen to point out that the timelines discussed, including the 2019 target for the crewed flight that SpaceX has been working toward until now, are \u201cnot deadlines,\u201d but are instead a \u201cbest guess\u201d in Musk\u2019s words, based on the current state of affairs. Said state of affairs can change quickly, and Bridenstine added that \u201cthere are still things we could learn [in testing]\u201d that could alter the timelines later than the first part of next year.\n\nAs for Crew Dragon product, Musk said SpaceX is ramping to a cadence of producing a new capsule around once every three or four months, a rate it hopes to achieve in order to \u201cget in a cadence of operational flights to the space station.\u201d\n\nBridenstine also addressed the tweet he posted in late September regarding SpaceX\u2019s Starship program update (posted in full below).\n\n\u201cAs the NASA Administrator, I have been focused on returning to realism when it comes to costs and schedules,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a lot of our programs have not been meeting costs and schedules. And this has been developing over time. And a lot of these programs are, you know, five years old, 10 years old [\u2026] so what we\u2019re trying to do is get back to a day where we have realistic costs and schedules, and so I was signaling, and I haven\u2019t done it just to SpaceX, but to all of our contractors that we need more realism built into the development timelines.\u201d\n\nStill, Bridentstine clarified that NASA definitely supports the Starship program as well, even if it\u2019s prioritizing Crew Dragon at the current moment. \u201cI want people to make no mistake: NASA has an interest in seeing Starship be successful,\u201d he said, while also pointing out NASA\u2019s recent investment in Starship via its \u201cTipping Point\u201d project funding.", "description": "NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine was at SpaceX HQ in Hawthorne, Calif. on Thursday, delivering an address alongside NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, who will launch aboard SpaceX\u2019s commercial Crew Dragon capsule, and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.
