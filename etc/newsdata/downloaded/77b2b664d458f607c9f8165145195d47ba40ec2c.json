That is why one of my many jobs is to ensure we have safety hardwired into every decision that they make.\"\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption Emergency services freed 20 trapped survivors and took eight days to clear the scene of the crash.\n\nA 70-metre wall of fire engulfed the two trains as fuel caught alight following the collision at about 08:10 BST on a Tuesday morning 20 years ago.\n\n\"We went through a massive fireball. I could feel the heat coming through the windows,\" Mr Duckworth said.\n\n\"I had no idea what was going on. I thought perhaps it was a bomb.\n\n\"We basically derailed and overturned, so our coach ended up on its side.\n\n\"There was a bit of a battle to get out. It's not easy to get out of an overturned carriage.\"\n\nWhen he got out Mr Duckworth saw \"smoke billowing out from charred carriages\" lying on their sides as police and rescuers swarmed over the wreckage to try to locate trapped survivors.\n\nIt would take days to remove all the bodies from the wreckage.\n\nImage caption Jonathan Duckworth said he was \"one of the lucky passengers\" as windows in his carriage did not break \"so the fireball was on the outside\"\n\nThe outcry that followed led to the biggest-ever safety reform of the country's rail network.\n\nA series of complex public inquires culminated in two reports by Lord Cullen.\n\nThe inquiry found the crash was caused by the Thames Trains service travelling from Paddington passing through a red signal.\n\nBut Lord Cullen concluded the crash was the culmination of \"a catalogue of failures to act\".\n\nHe levelled severe criticism at Thames Trains for its \"slack and less than adequate\" safety culture. It was fined \u00a32m in 2004.\n\nRailtrack, Network Rail's predecessor, was accused of a \"lamentable failure\" to introduce safe signalling systems in the entrance to Paddington station.\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption Lord Cullen levelled severe criticism at the rail industry for \"a catalogue of failures to act\" on known rail safety problems\n\nPaddington was supposed to be a watershed but a series of fatal rail crashes followed at Hatfield in 2000, at Selby in 2001 and at Potters Bar in 2002.\n\nThe Paddington Survivors Group, set up to help victims and bereaved families cope with trauma, campaigned to improve rail safety.\n\nUnder pressure from the group, a train protection warning system that halted trains passing through red signals became industry standard.\n\nThe group worked with the Office for Rail and Road and Network Rail to reorganise the industry in the wake of the crash.\n\nNetwork Rail, which superseded Railtrack in 2002, was fined \u00a34m in 2007 for health and safety breaches in the run-up to the Paddington crash, after years of campaigning by the survivors group.\n\nNumber of red signals passed by trains Broken down by severity\n\nIn addition to July seeing the highest number of Spads for more than a decade, the past 12 months has seen 10 trains pass red signals and reach the \"conflict point\" - the position along the track at which a collision could theoretically take place.\n\nThe average over the past five years has been between four and five.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Carriages overturned as the two trains crashed\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption A memorial garden has been created, partially overlooking the site of the rail crash\n\nConcern over the the increase led the Rail Safety and Security Board (RSSB) to write to Network Rail and all train and freight operating companies.\n\nMark Phillips, RSSB chief executive, said the 20th anniversary of the disaster was \"a timely reminder of what can go wrong if we don't keep our eyes on the ball\".\n\n\"We need to look at current train protection technology and industry initiatives, and ask whether enough is being done,\" he added.\n\nMr Duckworth said: \"The risk is now that there hasn't been a serious rail crash for 20 years, standards might drop and focus might change.\n\n\"The industry needs to keep recognising that safety is of great importance, because though these incidents don't happen anymore, when they do occur they are devastating.\"", "description": "Thirty-one people died when two trains collided after a driver missed a red signal on 5 October 1999.", "authors": ["Sam Francis", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/02F4/production/_108765700_hi003240174.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
