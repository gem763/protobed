If it looks like Elizabeth Warren is a credible, or Bernie Sanders is a credible opponent to Trump, the market will not be higher, it\u2019ll be lower.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cI think she\u2019d be a bear market, and bear markets generally go on for a year and they go down 25%.\u201d\n\nBased on today\u2019s market, that would be a drop of almost 7,000 points. Under the presidency of Barack Obama, the market went up 148 percent.\n\nAsked about former Vice President Joe Biden\u2018s potential effect on the market, Cooperman said \u201cWell he\u2019s more of a centrist, I could live with his policies, the question is how strong he is and whether he\u2019s willing to resist the progressive in his party, and whether he gets denomination. But he\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nWarren has recently been the subject of several viral freak-outs by Wall Street journalists and CEOs.\n\nWatch the clips above, via CNBC.\n\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com", "description": "Omega Advisors CEO Leon Cooperman continued to express Wall Street's panic over an Elizabeth Warren presidency when he said that \"They won't open the stock", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Cooperman-1200x629.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
