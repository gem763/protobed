But these plans are often met with resistance from privacy advocates, who say that this data will give tech giants an unprecedented view into the lives of their customers.\n\nThe lawsuit in question, which was first reported by The New York Times, is concerned with a deal made in 2017 between Google and the University of Chicago Medical Center (also a defendant). Google was given access to patient records from the University of Chicago Medicine between 2009 and 2016, which it said it would use to develop new AI tools.\n\nIn a blog post at the time, Google said it was ready to start \u201caccurately predicting medical events \u2014 such as whether patients will be hospitalized, how long they will stay, and whether their health is deteriorating.\u201d The company also noted it would use \u201cde-identified medical records\u201d from Chicago that would be \u201cstripped of any personally identifiable information.\u201d\n\nThe records included the dates of patients\u2019 stay which could help identify them\n\nWednesday\u2019s lawsuit claims that the company failed to do this. \u201cIn reality, these records were not sufficiently anonymized and put the patients\u2019 privacy at grave risk,\u201d it says.\n\nCrucially, the lawsuit says Google received records of when patients were admitted and discharged from the medical center, a potential violation of the federal health data privacy regulation known as HIPAA. This information, says the suit, could be combined with location data collected by Google\u2019s Android mobile OS to reveal individual patients\u2019 identities.\n\nThe rest of the information covered in the records is detailed. It includes individuals\u2019 height, weight, and vital signs; whether they suffer from diseases like cancer or AIDS; and records of recent of recent medical procedures, including transplants and and abortions.\n\nThe suit says the University of Chicago Medical Center also failed in its duties. \u201c[T]he University did not notify its patients, let alone obtain their express consent, before turning over their confidential medical records to Google for its own commercial gain.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit notably is similar to complaints made against Google\u2019s AI subsidiary DeepMind in the UK. There, DeepMind made a deal in 2015 to access patient records from the UK\u2019s National Health Service (NHS), which it used to develop an app for doctors and nurses. An investigation by the UK\u2019s data watchdog found that the deal \u201cfailed to comply with data protection law,\u201d and that DeepMind made \u201cinexcusable\u201d errors while handling the data.\n\nDeepMind later rewrote its contracts with the NHS and established new independent advisory boards to scrutinize its activities. These boards were shut down when the DeepMind department concerned, DeepMind Health, was absorbed into Google.\n\nGoogle and the University of Chicago Medical Center both deny the accusations laid out in the lawsuit.\n\nA spokesperson for Google told the New York Times: \u201cWe believe our health care research could help save lives in the future, which is why we take privacy seriously and follow all relevant rules and regulations in our handling of health.\u201d A spokesperson for the University of Chicago also told the Times that the claims were \u201cwithout merit.\u201d\n\nLawsuits such as these are often launched with the intent of attracting more plaintiffs. The lawsuit currently focuses on a single complaint by Matt Dinerstein, who was admitted to the Chicago University Medical Center in 2015.", "description": "Google is being sued along with the University of Chicago Medical Center in a potential class-action lawsuit which accuses the tech giant of inappropriately accessing sensitive medical records belonging to hundreds of thousands of hospital patients.", "authors": ["James Vincent", "Jun"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BLAD8BQU4bvCfUrKfizzP7q4zCE=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10802091/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0003.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-27"}
