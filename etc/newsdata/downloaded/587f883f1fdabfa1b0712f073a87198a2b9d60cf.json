We\u2019ll always be brothers.\n\n\"We\u2019re certainly on different paths at the moment but I will always be there for him and as I know he\u2019ll always be there for me.\n\n\u201cYou know, we don\u2019t see each other as much as we, as much as we used to because we\u2019re so busy.\n\n\"But, I love him dearly and, you know, the majority of the stuff is created out of nothing.\n\n\"Just as I said, as brothers, you know, you have good days, you have bad days.\u201d\n\nThe documentary was made during their recent tour of southern Africa.\n\nA royal source said senior royals are \u201cconcerned for the couple\u201d.\n\nThe source said: \u201cHarry and William\u2019s relationship is desperately sad.\n\n\"They\u2019re going completely separate ways and Harry is the one who seems to be visibly struggling.\n\n\u201cIt seems the boy who walked behind their mother\u2019s coffin, which is so vividly seared onto the nation\u2019s consciousness, has never fully recovered, which is an utter tragedy.\n\n\"Charles has sought to help the young men, even that hasn\u2019t helped.\n\n\u201cMany inside the family have said how seeing her sons drifting apart would be the last thing Diana would have wanted.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIn the film the 38-year-old Duchess spoke of the \u201creally \u00adchallenging\u201d time of being a new mother in the \u00adspotlight.\n\nAn emotional Meghan said pregnancy is a \u201creally vulnerable\u201d time.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess have been criticised for taking private flights while campaigning about the climate change.\n\nInterviews by Meghan\u2019s estranged dad Thomas, who did not attend their May 2018 nuptials, have no doubt not helped.\n\nHarry has also revealed his mental health is under \u201cconstant management\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cLook part of this job...means turning a cheek to a lot of this stuff.\n\n\"But again for me and for my wife of course there is a lot of stuff that hurts, especially when a lot of it is untrue.\u201d\n\nShe said: \u201cI\u2019ve said for a long time to H, it\u2019s not enough to just survive \u00adsomething, right?\n\n\"That\u2019s not the point of life. You\u2019ve got to thrive, you\u2019ve got to feel happy and I think I really tried to adopt this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip.\n\n\u201cBut I think what that does internally is probably really damaging.\n\n\"The biggest thing I know is I never thought this would be easy. But I thought it would be fair.\n\n\"That\u2019s the part that\u2019s really hard to reconcile. Just take each day as it comes.\u201d\n\nTom Bradby posed the argument that living with \u201cincredible power, privilege, fame and wealth\u201d comes with scrutiny.\n\nMeghan added: \u201cThe good thing is that I\u2019ve got my baby and I\u2019ve got my husband and they\u2019re the best.\u201d", "description": "The Duke of Sussex said despite their different paths, he loves his brother dearly and they will always be there for each other", "authors": ["Russell Myers", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20661986.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_harry_and_meghan_an_african_journey_02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
