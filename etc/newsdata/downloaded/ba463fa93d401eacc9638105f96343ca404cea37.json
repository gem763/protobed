We are now fighting on two fronts: one front against the Turkish invasion and a front against Daesh,\" he said.\n\nXelil said SDF fighters who had been protecting coalition forces in Syria for four years were now \"being martyred by Turkish warplanes in front of the eyes of the allies\" whom he said had \"suddenly and without forewarning abandoned us\".\n\nIt was an apparent reference to a U.S. move to withdraw forces from part of the border now being targeted by Turkey.\n\n\"We don't want them to send their troops to the frontlines ... all we want is that they close the air space to Turkish planes and they can do this easily\", he said.\n\nNoting Islamic State car bomb attacks in Qamishli and Hasaka and Turkish shelling of a jail in Qamishli that the SDF said allowed some IS detainees to escape, Xelil said: \"Despite all of this the world is still ignoring this reality and ignoring this coming hell\".\n\nIf the Turkish attack continued, SDF priorities would change with regards to guarding IS detainees and \"we will move to protect our cities and our people\", Xelil said in answer to a question.
