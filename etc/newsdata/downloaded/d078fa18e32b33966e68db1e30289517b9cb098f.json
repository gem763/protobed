Particularly seeing as we may not be able to get hold of any after 31 October. (Actually, that\u2019s unlikely, I must admit: retailers have been stockpiling for months. It\u2019s after Christmas that we\u2019ll feel the pinch if we crash out of Europe without a deal, but more of that anon.)\n\nBacktracking yet again: remember I said most people weren\u2019t mad about dark-coloured ros\u00e9? Well, I\u2019m going to recommend exactly that. Autumn food needs something more substantial than the whispery, pink Proven\u00e7al ros\u00e9s we were all drinking in May and June. And that means ros\u00e9s \u2013 or rosados \u2013 with a little more heft. These are wines you can drink with the last of the season\u2019s barbecues or with a salad that includes cooked vegetables and grains, rather than crunchy, young veg. Deep, fruity ros\u00e9s also work well with spicy food, which is, after all, a year-round pleasure. (Never tried an Indian takeaway with a fruity ros\u00e9? You should give it a go.) And their production is simply a question of the winemaker leaving the juice in contact with the skins for a little bit longer, or picking the grapes when they\u2019re a bit riper.\n\nAnd while you wouldn\u2019t have touched a ros\u00e9 aged in oak or concrete back in the heady days of spring, consider it now. But serve it a little bit warmer than you would a lighter ros\u00e9, much as you would (I hope) serve a white burgundy less chilled than a pinot grigio in order to allow its more complex flavours to shine through.\n\nYou can get half-bottles of the fabulous Domaine Tempier Bandol Ros\u00e9 (13%) for \u00a314.95 from Lea & Sandeman (or for \u00a313.95 a bottle if you feel like splashing out and buying it by the case) to test the theory out. Bandol is, in my opinion, the most interesting of the Provence ros\u00e9 appellations, and is perfectly suited to this time of year.\n\nAnd what about pink fizz, which for some reason seems to have more year-round appeal? There\u2019s plenty of it about, particularly from English winemakers, who are cashing in on the bumper 2018 harvest. One that\u2019s been around for a while is the Balfour 1503 English Sparkling Ros\u00e9 (\u00a319 Morrisons, \u00a320 Tesco; 12%), which has an appealing, savoury note, rather than just tutti frutti, red berry fruit. And, for an English wine, it\u2019s reasonably priced to boot.\n\nFour ros\u00e9s that stand up to autumn\n\nFrench Organic Ros\u00e9\n\n\u00a36.99 Aldi, 12.5%.\n\nA darker Languedoc ros\u00e9 to enjoy with a pork chop. And at a good price, too, considering it\u2019s organic.\n\nCorent C\u00f4tes d\u2019Auvergne 2018\n\n\u00a39.50 Wine Society, 13.5%.\n\nA robust wine from a ros\u00e9-only appellation. Great with grilled lamb.\n\nRosado Cellar de Silos Ribera del Duero 2018\n\n\u00a314.95 Berry Bros & Rudd, 13%.\n\nFull-bodied Spanish rosados tend to be more full-bodied than southern French ros\u00e9s, and this one could certainly take on a paella.\n\nMasseria Pietrosa Primitivo Rosato Salento 2018\n\n\u00a39.25 Morrisons, 12.5%.\n\nThis off-dry rosato would work with milder Indian and Cantonese food.\n\n\u2022 For more by Fiona Beckett, go to matchingfoodandwine.com\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
