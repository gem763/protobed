Trump told his chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to hold back almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine at least a week before the call in which Trump is said to have pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, according to three senior administration officials.\n\nTrump ordered hold on military aid days before calling Ukrainian president, officials say\n\nIn his Fox News appearance, Pence characterized Trump\u2019s communication with Zelensky as a \u201ccongratulatory call\u201d on an election that he won \u201cbuilt largely on the message of an anti-corruption campaign.\u201d Zelensky had been inaugurated as president on May 20.\n\n\u201cThe president spoke to him about our concern, investing hundreds of millions of American taxpayer dollars in seeing him move for a reform agenda,\u201d Pence said. \u201cPresident Trump made it clear that we\u2019ve got to see reforms.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe mentioned Vice President Biden and his son in the context of us wanting to see honest government,\u201d Pence continued. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what the American taxpayer would expect.\u201d\n\nEchoing Trump\u2019s comment hours earlier, Pence insisted \u201cthere was no quid pro quo\u201d regarding an investigation of the Bidens and military aid.\n\nHunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.\n\nHunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases \u2014 at one point, threatening to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.\n\nSince spring, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani has pushed the Ukrainians to investigate the matter.\n\nActing director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire has been unwilling to turn over the whistleblower complaint to Congress, a refusal that has rankled Democrats and heightened calls to impeach Trump. The whistleblower, whose identity has not been publicly disclosed, is said to be a U.S. intelligence official.", "description": "The vice president said the president is a victim of an \u201cassume-the-worst media.\u201d", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VlVGCoYct6PQcvNGiyvLL_R0PY4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WAFQZHG62EI6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
