Among other things, he said that the U.S. had \u201cwasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure\u201d and \u201cwasted lives\u201d there, that the war was \u201cnonsense,\u201d and that instead we should \u201crebuild the USA.\u201d\n\nOn Monday night, as president, Trump is expected to announce that he\u2019s sending several thousand more American troops to fight in the 16-year war.\n\nThere are currently about 8,400 U.S. soldiers stationed there, as well as approximately 6,000 from other members of NATO. The number of American troops in Afghanistan peaked at 100,000 in 2011. A total of 3,539 coalition soldiers have died during the war.\n\nAfghanistan was barely mentioned during the 2016 presidential campaign. The GOP platform did not say much on the subject. \u201cA Republican president will work with all regional leaders to restore mutual trust,\u201d it read. Trump said nothing about it during his convention and inaugural speeches, and essentially nothing in his campaign book, \u201cCrippled America.\u201d\n\nDuring an October 2015 interview with CNN, Trump was asked whether he believed \u201cthat American boots should stay on the ground in Afghanistan.\u201d He replied, \u201cWe made a terrible mistake getting involved there in the first place.\u201d He added: \u201cAre they going to be there for the next 200 years? At some point, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\nHowever, he did qualify his statement. \u201cI would leave the troops there, begrudgingly,\u201d he said. \u201cYou probably have to because that thing will collapse about two seconds after they leave.\u201d (A few weeks later Trump denied he\u2019d said that the Afghanistan war was a mistake.)\n\nBelow, in reverse chronological order, are Trump\u2019s statements on Twitter and television calling for the U.S. to withdraw.\n\nNovember 2013:", "description": "Trump is expected to announce Monday night that he's sending several thousand more U.S. troops to fight in the 16-year war.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/08/donald-trump-afghanistan-war-1503333123.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90&fit=crop&w=1200&h=800", "published_at": "2017-08-21"}
