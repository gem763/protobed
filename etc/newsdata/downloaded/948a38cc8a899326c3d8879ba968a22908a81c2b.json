He said \u201chell no\u201d when asked if he would join and explained that the Facebook-created cryptocurrency initiative didn\u2019t need to be a cryptocurrency to pull of its broader goals of democratizing the financial system. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a gimmick,\u201d Dorsey said, \u201cbut a cryptocurrency wasn\u2019t necessary to make that work\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an internet open standard that was born on the internet,\u201d Dorsey said. \u201cIt was born out of a company\u2019s intention, and it\u2019s not consistent with what I personally believe and what I want our company to stand for.\u201d\n\n\u201cHell no.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Dorsey was broadly enthusiastic about more decentralized cryptocurrencies, seeing them as part of an emergent international online community. \u201cI think the internet is somewhat of an emerging nation-state in almost every way,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cIt almost has a currency now in the form of cryptocurrency and bitcoin.\u201d\n\nFacebook\u2019s Libra project has hit a string of setbacks in recent weeks, starting with the abrupt withdrawal of Mastercard, Visa, Stripe, and other payment processors just hours before the Libra Association\u2019s inaugural meeting. That has left the association without a US payment processor, meaning it\u2019s facing an uncertain path to launching in the future.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in front of Congress yesterday about the company\u2019s goals with Libra, and he faced intense skepticism from lawmakers. He said he wished legislators could separate the cryptocurrency initiative from Facebook, as the company plans to play only a partial role once the broader association is realized. Still, Facebook\u2019s record of privacy breaches has cast a troubling shadow over the nascent payment network.\n\n\u201cDo you understand why this record makes us concerned with Facebook entering the cryptocurrency space?\u201d Rep. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez (D-NY) asked Zuckerberg at the hearing. \u201cDo you realize that you and Facebook have a credibility issue here?\u201d", "description": "Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey says the company won\u2019t join Facebook\u2019s Libra Association because it\u2019s an idea born out  of a company, which goes against what he and Twitter stand for.", "authors": ["Ashley Carman", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gW3vks-wJAn1Zhpzd-pnRR2cOWY=/0x162:2228x1328/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19316644/1149362482.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
