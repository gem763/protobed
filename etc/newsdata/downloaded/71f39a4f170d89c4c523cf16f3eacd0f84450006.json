The president\u2019s bungled bid to coerce Ukraine\u2019s leader into helping the Trump 2020 re-election campaign smear a rival struck \u201cdecide it at the ballot box\u201d off the menu of reasonable opinion forever. Mr. Trump\u2019s brazen attempt to cheat his way into a second term stands so scandalously exposed that there can be no assurance of a fair election if he\u2019s allowed to stay in office. Resolving the question of the president\u2019s fitness at the ballot box isn\u2019t really an option, much less the best option, when the question boils down to whether the ballot box will be stuffed.\n\nImpeachment is therefore imperative, not only to protect the integrity of next year\u2019s elections but to secure America\u2019s continued democratic existence. If the House does its job, it will fall to Senate Republicans to reveal, in their decision to convict (or not), their preferred flavor of republic: constitutional or banana.", "description": "", "authors": ["Will Wilkinson", "Nytimes.Com Opinion"], "top_image": ""}
