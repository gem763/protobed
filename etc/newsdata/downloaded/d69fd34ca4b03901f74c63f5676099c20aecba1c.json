A modified version of Amazon\u2019s X-ray tools allows children to look up words, which are added to word lists as vocabulary builders including flash cards and Amazon\u2019s existing \u201cword wise\u201d aids.\n\nWord and phrase translation into and from other languages is available, but access to Wikipedia, as usually found on Amazon\u2019s Kindle, is restricted. Amazon\u2019s search has also been modified to help children find books without having to know the exact spelling of titles or authors.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The cases come in a choice of two colours.

The Kindle is also covered by a two-year warranty and the company will replace the device if it is broken during use.\n\nMirroring Amazon\u2019s Kids Editions of its Fire tablet range, the new Kindle also has an extensive parental dashboard showing what children are reading and how often, alongside quick summaries and conversation points from the books to aid discussion and engagement.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Amazon\u2019s updated Fire HD 10 tablet range. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nAlongside the new Kindle, Amazon launched an updated version of its \u00a3149.99 Fire HD 10 tablet. Amazon\u2019s largest Android tablet is now 30% faster and lasts up to two hours longer with a battery life of 12 hours of mixed use.\n\nThe Fire HD 10 also now comes with improved wifi, faster USB-C charging, reaching 80% in three hours, and an updated version of Fire OS with support for picture-in-picture for video playback while multitasking. It will be available in a range of new colours including an more premium-looking all-white version for the first time.\n\nA \u00a3199.99 Kids Edition of the Fire HD 10 will also be available, including the improved kid-proof kickstand case introduced with the Fire 7 Kids Edition earlier this year. It too comes with one-year of Amazon\u2019s Kids Unlimited content, extensive parental controls, access to a hand-curated, age-appropriate list of websites and the two-year warranty.\n\nThe new products are now available for pre-order, shipping on 30 October.", "description": "New 6in Kindle Kids Edition comes with 1,000 books, word-building tools and parental controls", "authors": ["Samuel Gibbs"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88b6058bd2e4979006c6fac631d43a08cb8c52f5/132_571_3702_2221/master/3702.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=499b36b80cacf25d8c2cb65433ceef35", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
