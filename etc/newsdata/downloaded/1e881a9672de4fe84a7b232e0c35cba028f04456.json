Are their wages enough to live on? Does American trade policy endanger their financial future? And, most importantly, has President Trump made their lives better?\n\nIn 2016, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in Michigan by a slim 10,704 votes \u2014 a razor-thin two-tenths of a percentage point. Democrats hoping to reclaim the White House have made no secret about the importance of this swing state in 2020. They spent much of the summer actively courting union members, dropping in on strikes and offering up pro-labor messages.\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden repeatedly declares on the stump: \u201cI\u2019m a union guy.\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has picketed with unions across the country and includes the Woody Guthrie song \u201cUnion Maid\u201d in his pre-rally warm-up music.\n\nAnd when GM workers walked off the job last week, Democratic presidential candidates hastily arranged visits to picket lines.\n\nOn Thursday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) told Detroit autoworkers they should be rewarded for making concessions \u201cwhen this company was in some bad straits.\u201d On Sunday, Biden spoke to a local union in Kansas City, Kan., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) picketed with workers in Detroit. Sanders plans to visit in coming days.\n\nBiden donned a red union shirt and told workers in Kansas City that his father sold GM cars, which helped put Biden through school. He said he saw the impact of plant closings on communities in his home state of Delaware.\n\n\u201cNone of it\u2019s left,\u201d he said of Delaware\u2019s auto plants, \u201cand a lot of people have been left behind.\u201d\n\nWhat GM is doing might be legal, Biden said, but it\u2019s not moral.\n\n\u201cWhen things started to go well, what did they do?\u201d Biden asked the crowd from the back of a pickup truck. \u201cThey raised salaries for the CEO.\u201d\n\nBiden said putting a Democrat in the White House was key to the future of labor.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t win this, and I say this with all earnestness, if the folks that share my view don\u2019t win this, a lot of unions are in trouble,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Detroit-Hamtramck plant where Warren and Klobuchar visited makes the Cadillac CT6 and the Chevrolet Impala. It\u2019s slated to be closed by GM by 2020 \u2014 at the cost of about 800 jobs \u2014 though picketing workers hope the company will open an electric truck facility there.\n\nSpeaking to a small crowd of workers and reporters at the plant Sunday, Warren blasted GM for closing five plants around the United States despite making \u201cbillions of dollars in profits\u201d last year.\n\n\u201cGM is demonstrating that it has no loyalty to the workers of America, or to the people of America. Their only loyalty is to their own bottom line,\u201d Warren said. \u201cAnd if they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico, or to Asia, or anywhere else on this planet, they will do it. Well, the workers of the UAW are here to say \u2018No more!\u2019 \u201d\n\nReturning to a pillar of her campaign message, Warren credited unions with building America\u2019s middle class \u2014 and said \u201cwhen unions win, all Americans win.\u201d As she spoke, chants of \u201cUAW! UAW!\u201d broke out.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear, however, if the message is resonating. Unions have been slow to endorse candidates in the expansive Democratic primary, which once included two dozen candidates.\n\nAnd Trump has claimed that even if union leaders publicly support Democrats, union members are on his side. In April, after the International Association of Fire Fighters endorsed Biden, Trump dismissed the importance of the endorsement.\n\n\u201cThe Dues Sucking firefighters leadership will always support Democrats, even though the membership wants me. Some things never change!\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nLarry Jones, 64, a GM employee for 44 years who was picketing at the Detroit-Hamtramck facility Tuesday, said he understood that his plight depends not just on the whims of GM\u2019s board, but also on the policies of the person who occupies the White House.\n\nTrump\u2019s report card, he added, has been a subject of debate both on the picket lines and, before then, in company breakrooms.\n\n\u201cAll this stuff he\u2019s saying about the jobs he\u2019s going to keep \u2014 jobs are still going to Mexico,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI know some of them that voted for Trump. I understand where they\u2019re coming from. They wanted to give him a chance. He was a businessman, he was rich, he wasn\u2019t beholden to anybody. They wanted a change, and they got it. But change isn\u2019t always good.\u201d\n\nWhile campaigning, Trump vowed to roll back Obama-era regulations on business, including appointing a Republican-controlled National Labor Relations Board that critics say has dealt a blow to workers\u2019 rights.\n\nOther autoworkers said Trump is anything but anti-worker, as evidenced by his stance on NAFTA and trade policy with China.\n\n\u201cWe like Donald Trump because he\u2019s fighting for us,\u201d said Brian Pannebecker, an autoworker who runs the \u201cAutoworkers for Trump 2020\u201d Facebook group, which includes conservative and pro-Trump political messages with photos and news clips about the ongoing strike. \u201c. . . He said he was going to get rid of NAFTA, and he did. Everybody up here hates it. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s a good start. And now he\u2019s finally pushing back against China, who\u2019s been eating our lunch for years. Donald Trump said those days are over.\u201d\n\nLast year, the United States, Canada and Mexico agreed to replace NAFTA with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, though it has not yet been ratified by Congress.\n\nPannebecker and like-minded autoworkers feel \u201cthe Democrats are standing in the way,\u201d he said. \u201cDonald Trump is trying to keep his campaign promises. The Democrats are trying to sabotage his presidency.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to the union vote, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) said the people who want to be president have to do more than put on a union T-shirt or pick up a pro-union picket sign.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not enough anymore,\u201d she said last week as she handed out candy to striking workers. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to vote for the person who\u2019s not taking corporate money. You\u2019ve got to be pro-union, plus you\u2019ve got to support access to health care. You have to be pro-climate. You have to support a living wage.\u201d\n\nDan Best, a forklift operator who has worked for GM for 35 years, said he had heard rumors Sunday morning that Warren might stop by the picket line but thought he would miss her because he was standing at the plant\u2019s east gate, instead of the main gate about a quarter-mile away.\n\nWhen Warren appeared Sunday afternoon after all, Best was \u201cecstatic.\u201d She lingered at the side entrance for about five minutes \u2014 long enough to take some pictures and voice her support for the striking workers there \u2014 but Best said even the brief visit did a lot to buoy their spirits.\n\n\u201cI was just so pleased to have her support,\u201d Best said. \u201cI think a lot of people were surprised. We were just really happy to see her. It means a lot to us.\u201d\n\nAmy B Wang and Kim Mueller contributed to this report.", "description": "Biden, Klobuchar and Warren have all made appearances; Sanders plans to visit in coming days.", "authors": ["Cleve R.
