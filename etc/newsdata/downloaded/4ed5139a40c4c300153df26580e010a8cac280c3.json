A Justice Department spokeswoman said it was reviewing the decision.\n\nThe material covered by Howell's order includes redacted grand jury material mentioned in Mueller's report, which is the only piece of the document that Democrats have yet to see.\n\n191023020053395\n\nIn a 75-page ruling accompanying the order, Howell slashed through many of the administration's arguments for withholding materials from Congress. While the Justice Department said it could not provide grand jury material under existing law, \"DOJ is wrong\", she wrote. And while the White House and its Republican allies argued impeachment is illegitimate without a formal vote, she later added, \"A House resolution has never, in fact, been required.\"\n\nThe judge also rejected the Justice Department's argument that impeachment is not a \"judicial proceeding\" under the law, for which the information could be disclosed.\n\nJustice Department lawyers argued against providing the materials at a hearing earlier this month. They said House Democrats already had sufficient evidence from Mueller's investigation, including copies of summaries of FBI witness interviews.\n\nMany of the key witnesses in the Trump orbit, including former White House counsel Don McGahn, submitted to voluntary interviews before Mueller's team rather than appear before the grand jury, making it unclear how much significant new information tied to the president is contained in the grand jury transcripts.\n\nThe department had also argued that the House panel could not show how the material would help in the committee's investigations of Trump.", "description": "In a victory for Democrats, the order includes redacted grand jury material mentioned in Robert Mueller's report.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/7/25/b0d87cb0f236418a91740ba960b0cfae_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
