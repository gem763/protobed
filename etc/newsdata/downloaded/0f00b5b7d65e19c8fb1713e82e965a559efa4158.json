Scheifele has a goal and five assists in his last three games.\n\n\u201cA nice pass by Wheels and I put her home.\u201d Scheifele said. \u201cWe were able to battle back and we just played solid. A lot of room to grow and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d\n\nWheeler joked that Scheifele\u2019s shot on the game-winner was \u201chis offspeed.\u201d Lehner thought it looked more like a funky breaking pitch.\n\n\u201cIt just dove on me,\u201d Lehner said. \u201cHe missed his shot. It\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d\n\nAndrew Copp and Nikolaj Ehlers also scored for Winnipeg, which trailed 2-0 in the first period. Connor Hellebuyck stopped 27 shots.\n\n\u201cThe first period, you\u2019ve got to credit them,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cThey were obviously quicker than us and made it difficult for us to play our game.\u201d\n\nBrandon Saad scored short-handed and Brent Seabrook had a power-play for Chicago. Lehner, a Vezina Trophy finalist with the New York Islanders last season and signed to a one-year contract during the summer, finished with 30 saves in his Blackhawks debut as they fell to 0-3-0.\n\n\u201cI thought I made some good saves and felt comfortable,\u201d Lehner said. \u201cWe got a point, which is something, but should\u2019ve got a win today.\u201d\n\nCopp\u2019s easy tap-in goal tied it at 2 with 8:16 left in the third. He was alone at the left edge of the crease and redirected Kyle Connor\u2019s feed from the right side of the net before Lehner could react.\n\nEhlers pulled Winnipeg to 2-1 with a one-timer on a power play at 7:05 of the second period.\n\nDefenseman Calvin de Haan also made his debut with Chicago after being sidelined with a groin injury and was on the ice when Copp got open to tie it. The 28-year-old also had offseason shoulder surgery and was acquired from Carolina in a multiplayer trade in June.\n\nThe Blackhawks eventually couldn\u2019t stop Scheifele and Wheeler, but they did keep their linemate, Patrik Laine, off the board. The 21-year-old Laine entered with 10 points - tied for the league lead - in his first five games after signing a two-year, $13.5 million deal as a restricted free agent less than a week before the start of the season.\n\nSaad opened the scoring with a short-handed goal 4:02 in as he redirected Ryan Carpenter\u2019s pass between Hellebuyck\u2019s pads to complete a 2-on-1 break.\n\nSeabrook\u2019s power-play goal with 7:23 left in the opening period made it 2-0. After Hellebuyck stopped Duncan Keith\u2019s shot from the left point, Seabrook cut to the slot and fired in a loose luck from a scramble in the crease.\n\nLehner robbed Scheifele with a sprawling point-blank left pad save with 1:44 left in the second to keep Chicago ahead as the Jets pushed back. Scheifele was alone at the low edge of the left circle when he took a pinpoint cross-ice pass from Wheeler.\n\n\u201cWe had a number of Grade-As that we\u2019re used to finding net on,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cTheir goalie was outstanding.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Chicago LW Brendan Perlini played after sitting out the first two games as coach Jeremy Colliton shook up his lineup and line combinations after two losses. \u2026 Blackhawks LW Alexander Nylander and D Slater Koekkoek didn\u2019t dress. \u2026 Winnipeg has opened wthe season with five road games in its first six games.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nJets: host Pittsburgh on Sunday in the opener of a six-game homestand.\n\nBlackhawks: Host Edmonton on Monday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: www.apnews.com/NHL and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After being kept off the scoresheet in regulation, Mark Scheifele finally broke through when it really counted.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Matt Carlson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/jets_blackhawks_hockey_04134_c0-264-6336-3960_s1200x700.jpg?1780255efbd7285e77b9a979d4cce8612f13d3a8", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
