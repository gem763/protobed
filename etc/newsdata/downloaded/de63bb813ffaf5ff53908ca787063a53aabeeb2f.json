But nonetheless, it's risk.\"\n\nTekne is also an investor in Facebook and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.\n\nMr Kothari said Alibaba was an \"unbelievably powerful\" business \u2013 with a market share in China of 70 per cent compared with Amazon's market share of 40 per cent \u2013 but it was operating in a \"difficult economy\" as, in his view, China was in recession.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis pick of PagSeguro bested the choice of New Oriental Education & Technology Group, which rallied 81 per cent, by Tribeca Investment Partners lead portfolio manager Jun Bei Liu.\n\nThe third place went to APS Asset Management chief investment officer Kok Hoi Wong, who picked Venustech, a network security provider in China that gained 56 per cent.\n\nMr Kothari remained upbeat about the prospects for PagSeguro, which offers a digital payments system for Brazil's micro-merchants, or small businesses composed of one or two people.\n\nHe said the development of PagBank, a virtual bank, was \"creating a better story over the next 10 years than we've seen over the last few years\" given it would open up banking services to the unbanked and underbanked.\n\n\"Globally this underbanked or unbanked population is substantially larger than people think it is,\" he added. \"I think neo banks as a category is going to be a global phenomenon.\"\n\nIan Gibson, director of Attunga Capital, delivered the best investment portfolio return \u2013 composed of stocks recommended at the conference \u2013 among last year's conference attendees.\n\nHis portfolio, which included PagSeguro, gained 90.6 per cent.\n\nThe Sohn Hearts & Minds Investment Leaders Conference will be held on Friday, November 22.", "description": "Tekne Capital's Beeneet Kothari, who scored a 97 per cent gain with his top pick at last year's Sohn conference, warns about the regulatory and credit risk for the sector.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2829%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_174/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c14421825ab132227ab1fa98d38919035a5d63dc", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
