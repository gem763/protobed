The group's current share price of around R24 a share, while \"interesting and reasonable priced,\" was not \"bargain basement\".\n\n\"There is no sign yet that the competitive landscape in the fast food sector is abating,\" said Clark, adding that StatsSA numbers show lacklustre rises in fast food sales.
