And now, after a full year, they\u2019re finally going ahead with it. Here\u2019s what we know about the looming ceremony, which is set to take place on Monday, September 30 (yes, a Monday) in South Carolina. It seems only yesterday when Bieber abandoned his pet monkey overseas! Ah, kids, they grow up so fast.\n\nThe big day is almost here.\n\nEarlier this year, \u201cPage Six\u201d and TMZ reported that the couple\u2019s wedding would take place over the weekend of March 1, which just so happened to be Bieber\u2019s 25th birthday. And then the details started to change, with sources reporting that the couple had delayed the ceremony for the third time, due to certain loved ones being unable to make it. A source who spoke to People in mid-March said that the couple had put the wedding on indefinite hold, as Bieber focused on his mental-health struggles.\n\nBy June, Us Weekly reported that the couple might be close to setting a date, finally. \u201cThey have talked about possibly having their wedding closer to their one-year marriage anniversary date in September,\u201d a source said. Finally, Baldwin and Bieber have a date to which they are almost definitely sticking. In August, TMZ got its hands on a save-the-date invite that features comic book\u2013style art of the couple, with the ceremony date listed as September 30. (Yes, it\u2019s on a Monday. No, we have no idea as to why.)\n\nWhere will the wedding take place?\n\nBaldwin and Bieber decided on a South Carolina setting for their second nuptials \u2014 specifically, the Montage Palmetto Bluff, a 20,000-acre luxury waterfront resort.\n\nExpect partying and praying.\n\nA big Christian wedding, where guests can simultaneously partake in the married couple\u2019s favorite pastimes: praying and partying. There will apparently be dancers, and Bieber\u2019s personal DJ, Tay James, will be behind the music. The event will be spearheaded by Mindy Weiss, who is the go-to party planner for Baldwin\u2019s friends, the Kardashian-Jenners.\n\nThey\u2019re inviting many of their \u201cChristian friends.\u201d\n\nTheir guest list is quite eclectic: Aside from the couple\u2019s family members and Baldwin\u2019s close friends, like Kendall Jenner and the Hadids, the couple is inviting \u201ca lot of their pastor friends and a lot of their Christian friends,\u201d Baldwin\u2019s dad recently told TMZ. It\u2019s not exactly clear who all will be in the wedding, though. As of now, we know that Alaia and Ireland Baldwin will be bridesmaids, and that Baldwin\u2019s dad will walk her down the aisle. And, though plans may have changed, Baldwin told the Cut last September that the couple was thinking of having Bieber\u2019s little sister Jazmyn be the flower girl, as long as the 10-year-old isn\u2019t \u201ctoo old\u201d to have that role.\n\nThe Biebers are already ruining total strangers\u2019 luxury vacations.\n\nAccording to TMZ, guests at Montage Palmetto Bluff are \u201cLIVID\u201d \u2014 indeed, LIVID \u2014 because the Biebers have ordered the resort to close off the spa, pool, and one \u201cfancy restaurant\u201d from guests, from noon this Sunday through next Tuesday. Apparently, the Biebers want \u201cthe most prized areas on the property\u201d to be accessible by their friends and family, only. To make matters worse, the hotel only informed guests of this indignity this past week via email, which TMZ recently obtained. In an attempt to assuage guests\u2019 frustration, TMZ reports that the Montage is offering \u201cguests refunds, alternate bookings and upgrades \u2026 and for those willing to brave the Bieber nuptials, dinner on the house in one of the other restaurants.\u201d", "description": "Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin are finally moving forward with their second wedding ceremony, a big Christian bash, which will happen in September.
