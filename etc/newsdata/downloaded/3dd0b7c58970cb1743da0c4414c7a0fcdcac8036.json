This means they could accurately reconstruct evolution from further back than ever before, according to the paper published in Nature.\n\nResearchers from the University of Copenhagen and the University of Cambridge identified an almost complete set of proteins in the dental enamel of the extinct Stephanorhinus, which lived in what is now Georgia during the Pleistocene period.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Scientists use mass spectrometry to reconstruct the sequence of the amino acids, which allows them to understand an organism\u2019s key genetic information.\n\n\u201cWe have a solution that allows us to generate information beyond the limit of ancient DNA and this can be applied to technically any large mammal species,\u201d lead researcher Professor Enrico Cappellini from the University of Copenhagen told The Independent.\n\n\u201cFor 20 years ancient DNA has been used to address questions about the evolution of extinct species, adaptation and human migration but it has limitations. Now for the first time we have retrieved ancient genetic information which allows us to reconstruct molecular evolution way beyond the usual time,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis new analysis of ancient proteins from dental enamel will start an exciting new chapter in the study of molecular evolution.\u201d\n\nBefore this discovery, the earliest DNA sequenced was from a 700,000-year-old horse. Currently DNA data tracks human evolution to the last 400,000 years but lineages that led to the modern humans and chimps branched between 6 and 7 million years ago.\n\nThis means scientists have no genetic information for more than 90 per cent of the evolutionary path that led to modern humans. For example, the genetic links between modern humans and the extinct Homo erectus are still not known because everything is based on anatomical \u2013 as opposed to genetic \u2013 information.\n\nThis is because DNA degrades \u2013 unless specimens are preserved in permafrost \u2013 after approximately 500,000 years. In contrast, proteins can last millions of years and using mass spectrometry scientists can individually identify proteins and work out how old they are.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It will revolutionise the methods of investigating evolution based on molecular markers and it will open a complete new field of ancient biomolecular studies,\u201d said lead author on the paper Professor Eske Willerslev from the University of Cambridge.", "description": "Scientists have extracted the oldest genetic information ever found\u00a0from a 1.7-million-year-old rhino tooth, using a technique that has been described as a \u201cgame-changer\u201d\u00a0which could\u00a0revolutionise our understanding of evolution.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/11/12/2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
