APAC Ltd. (1876.HK), it said Thursday.\n\nThe world's largest brewer will raise $750 million in gross proceeds from the exercise that it will use to repay debt.\n\nLast month, AB InBev raised $5 billion through an IPO of its Asian operations in Hong Kong, making it the world's second-largest listing so far this year, behind U.S. ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc.'s (UBER) $8.1 billion New York listing in May, according to Dealogic.\n\nBudweiser, which sells its namesake beer as well as Corona, Stella Artois and other brands in the region, is now worth more than Japan's Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. (2502.TO), Denmark's Carlsberg A/S (CARL-A.KO) and local rival China Resources Beer (Holdings) Co. (0291.HK).\n\nShares of Budweiser closed 5.3% higher on Wednesday at 29.70 Hong Kong dollars (US$3.79).\n\nWrite to P.R.
