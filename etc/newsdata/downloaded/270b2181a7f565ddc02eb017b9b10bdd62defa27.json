When President Obama was in the White House, there was lots of oversight on the Fast and Furious scandal and the Benghazi tragedy. We covered it. There were whistleblowers. We covered them. Journalists who covered and citizens who followed Benghazi may find it stunning to find Republican members of Congress trash-talking whistle-blowers and the oversight responsibilities of the House. Stunning.\u201d\n\nAfter playing clips of Pompeo and Graham and Giuliani demanding oversight of Democratic administrations, Tapper said, \u201cThe arguments that Democratic presidents needed to comply with congressional oversight were correct. That\u2019s how the system was set up. If you only apply constitutional standards to the other political party and not to your own, then those aren\u2019t principles, they\u2019re tactics.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Sunday's broadcast of CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d host Jake Tapper accused Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Sen.
