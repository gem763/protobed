His newest series, \u201cThe Beautiful World of Jeffree Star,\u201d aims to be his biggest one yet, going behind the scenes with one of YouTube\u2019s most prominent and controversial beauty moguls at a time when the community was undergoing its biggest feud to date.\n\nDawson dropped the first trailer for the series yesterday after months of teasing. It has amassed 5 million views in just over 12 hours and landed at the top of YouTube\u2019s Trending page. People are excited about Dawson\u2019s highly anticipated new series for the same reasons they were excited for his past videos on creators like Jake Paul, Eugenia Cooney, and Tana Mongeau: insider access.\n\nThe documentary series follows Star as he travels, works on his multimillion-dollar makeup line, and deals with personal issues. But it\u2019s impossible to talk about his life without the backdrop of what\u2019s happening in the YouTube community \u2014 especially the beauty scene. One of the key stories that Dawson\u2019s doc will cover is the controversial feud between beauty gurus James Charles and Tati Westbrook, two creators who Dawson and Star know. The personalities\u2019 very public fight led to Charles losing more than 2 million subscribers in less than 48 hours, and it heavily dominated conversation within the YouTube community.\n\nPeople who were obsessed with Charles and Westbrook\u2019s back-and-forth or updates from YouTube commentary and drama channels were glued to YouTube and Instagram. But the heavily edited, 45-minute staged testimonials only carried so much information about the bitter war. \u201cThe Beautiful World of Jeffree Star\u201d has the advantage of starring two of YouTube\u2019s most influential and connected people: Star as a cornerstone of the beauty community and Dawson acting as a placeholder for fans who were also watching everything unfold.\n\nThe series isn\u2019t just drama, though. All of the big moments from Dawson and Star\u2019s lives, which have been posted on Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, and even YouTube from time to time, are given more attention. Dawson\u2019s marriage proposal, Star\u2019s dog dying, and Dawson\u2019s own controversy from earlier this year (which led to the #ShaneDawsonIsOverParty hashtag on Twitter) will be explored in depth.\n\nDawson being at the center of a documentary about another creator might seem strange, but his life is intertwined with Star\u2019s. The two have collaborated on makeup lines together, have many of the same friends, and operate within the same community. It\u2019s more challenging for Dawson to tell Star\u2019s story without including his own life events. Plus, it\u2019s what his fans are looking to see. It\u2019s the type of access and apparent openness that fans have come to expect from creators. The events of Dawson\u2019s documentary will be familiar to people who follow him and his friends closely, making the intimate conversations the real draw.\n\nDawson being at the center of a documentary about another creator might seem strange, but his life is intertwined with Star\u2019s\n\nSince Dawson started rolling out these docuseries over the last two years, other creators have tried to replicate his success. Even Jake Paul, who was the subject of one of Dawson\u2019s series, produced his own behind-the-scenes show about life in his vlogger collective mansion. But none have come close to Dawson\u2019s success. Docuseries have become Dawson\u2019s most prominent project, but they require months of recording and editing. He\u2019s taken time away from more frequent uploads to focus on producing lengthier projects, straying away from the grind of a traditional YouTube upload schedule. It\u2019s something his fans have wholly supported, however, as they turn every new episode of his series into appointment TV.\n\n\u201cThe Beautiful World of Jeffree Star\u201d will come out on October 1st. It\u2019s unclear how much of the series Dawson is releasing on that day.", "description": "Shane Dawson\u2019s new series, \"The Beautiful World of Jeffree Star,\" aims to be his biggest one yet, going behind the scenes with one of YouTube\u2019s most prominent and controversial beauty moguls at a time when the community was undergoing its biggest feud to date between James Charles and Tati Westbrook.", "authors": ["Julia Alexander", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iuTPHFaCVDZfvvnPZoP3SDnqHA8=/0x0:688x360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19230892/Screen_Shot_2019_09_25_at_7.51.36_AM.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
