Steny Hoyer, Maryland Democrat, said the chamber will consider the legislation during the week of Oct. 21.\n\nCalled the Stopping Harmful Interference in Elections for a Lasting Democracy (SHIELD) Act, the bill contains several provisions meant to protect the U.S. electoral process from foreign meddling as related concerns linger ahead of next year\u2019s presidential contest.\n\nAmong the bill\u2019s language is a requirement for political campaigns, parties and political committees to report attempts by foreign governments, foreign political parties and their agents to influence U.S. elections by offering assistance.\n\nPolitical campaigns and candidates who fail to disclose any offers of foreign help would be subject to criminal and civil liabilities if the bill becomes law as written.\n\nThe bill was introduced on Tuesday this week by Rep. Zoe Lofgren, California Democrat, and is similar to legislation proposed months ago in the Senate, the Foreign Influence Reporting in Elections (FIRE) Act, by Sen. Mark Warner, Virginia Democrat.\n\nMr. Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, introduced his version after revelations emerged involving a number of interactions between members of President Trump\u2019s election campaign and Russian nationals during the last White House race.\n\nMore recently, Ms. Lofgren, the chairwoman of the House Committee on House Administration, offered her bill after Mr. Trump urged both Ukraine and China last week to investigate 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden.\n\n\u201cMost Americans know that foreign governments have no business interfering in our elections,\u201d Ms. Lofgren, California Democrat, said when she introduced the bill this week. \u201cInstead, the Trump campaign and White House have welcomed and repeatedly solicited foreign assistance for his political activities. This behavior is unacceptable, and it is telling that the White House has gone to great lengths to hide it from the American people.\u201d\n\nEighty-seven percent of voters, including 80 percent of Republicans, support requiring that political campaigns alert the FBI in the event of receiving information from foreign governments, according to the results of a Quinnipiac University poll released in July.\n\nThe U.S. government has established that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to help Mr. Trump defeat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. A lengthy Department of Justice investigation conducted afterward ultimately uncovered numerous interactions between members of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Russian nationals, but the probe failed to find any evidence to provide they had conspired or coordinated together.\n\nMr. Trump said in a June television interview that he would probably accept dirt on his political opponents offered by foreign nationals. He subsequently asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a phone call the following month to investigate Mr. Biden, triggering a member of the U.S. intelligence community to file a whistleblower complaint that culminated in House Democrats initiating an impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Trump has denied wrongdoing with respect to his foreign outreach. He reiterated his request to Ukraine while speaking to reporters last week, adding: \u201cChina, likewise, should start an investigation.\u201d\n\nMs. Lofgren\u2019s bill has 11 co-sponsors currently, all Democrats. The House Administration Committee plans to mark it up next week, Politico reported, citing a committee staffer.\n\nMr. Warner\u2019s version has 10 co-sponsors, including one Republican and one independent.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
