This is thought to suppress activity in the area of the brain that triggers headaches.\n\nScientists from the University of Texas in Dallas set out to uncover GammaCore's effectiveness in vestibular migraines (VM), which cause vertigo but not necessarily a headache.\n\nFourteen VM sufferers held the device against their neck for two minutes during an attack. This improved vertigo in 13 of the participants, with two experiencing no dizziness afterwards.\n\nElectrical stimulation that zaps away cluster headaches may relieve the most common cause of vertigo. A non-invasive device, called GammaCore, (pictured being used) is available on the NHS to relieve cluster headaches and is also approved for 'typical' migraines in the US\n\n'There's a huge need for effective treatments for vestibular migraine attacks,' study author Dr Shin Beh said.\n\n'People with vestibular migraine do not always have headaches and when they do, they are often less severe than in typical migraine, so the pain-relieving drugs used for typical migraine often are not effective.\n\n'People can take drugs that suppress the vertigo or the nausea, but those drugs cause drowsiness and make it hard for people to go about their usual activities.'\n\nSix million people in the UK are thought to suffer from migraines, with 190,000 attacks occurring every day, according to NICE.\n\nAnd in the US, 12 per cent of people suffer from the agonising headaches, Migraine Research Foundation statistics show.\n\nVMs cause the same symptoms as 'typical' migraines, but do not always trigger a pounding headache. Sufferers typically endure vertigo, imbalance, nausea and vomiting.\n\nAccording to the M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's Society, VMs affect around 10 per cent of migraine sufferers.\n\nIn the trial, 18 participants were studied, 14 of which tried GammaCore during a VM attack. The remaining four were treated for dizziness that persisted between episodes.\n\nResults - published in the journal Neurology - revealed 13 of the 14 patients saw their vertigo improve after the stimulation. Five reported it easing by at least 50 per cent.\n\nHOW DOES GAMMACORE WORK? A non-invasive device called GammaCore could 'zap' away headaches and migraines. When placed against a patient's neck mid-attack, electrical impulses are sent to the vagus nerve. This is thought to target the connections between the nucleus tractus solitarius, a cluster of nerve cells, and the trigeminal nerve. Also known as the fifth cranial nerve, the trigeminal nerve is responsible for sensation and motor functions in the face, such as biting and chewing. Targeting these connections blocks signals in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, which is involved in pain. GammaCore is approved in the US and on NHS England to relieve cluster headaches but only for 'typical' migraines in the US.\n\nVertigo severity fell from an average of 5.2 out of 10 before the treatment to 3.1 15 minutes after it ended.\n\nOf the five participants who suffered headaches during their VM attack, all reported improvement after treatment.\n\nHeadache severity was reduced from an average of six to just 2.4 out of 10.\n\nThe four patients who were treated for dizziness between attacks reported no benefit.\n\nThe scientists believe this dizziness may require multiple treatments over time rather than just a single two-minute session.\n\nThe only side effect recorded was a mild pulling sensation on the neck muscles.\n\nGammaCore stimulates the vagus nerve, an 'important highway of communication between your brain and many parts of the body', according to its manufacturer electroCore's website.\n\nThis stimulation 'is believed to help block the pain signals that cause migraines and cluster attacks'.\n\nSpeaking of the clinical significance of the results, Dr Beh said: 'VM is the most common neurologic cause of vertigo and can greatly interfere with a person\u2019s daily life.'\n\nThe researchers note their study was small, lacked a control group and was unblinded, with both the patients and scientists knowing the participants were receiving the treatment.\n\n'If these results can be confirmed with larger studies, not only could there finally be a treatment for vestibular migraine, such a treatment would also be easy to use,' Dr Beh said.\n\nNo treatment is specifically approved for VM in the US or UK. Painkillers are often ineffective due to the condition not always triggering a headache.\n\nAnti-nausea drugs and those that suppress the vestibular system, which controls balance, are often used but can cause drowsiness.\n\nNHS England announced in May it will fund GammaCore for cluster headaches.", "description": "The non-invasive device, called GammaCore (pictured being used), is already available on the NHS in England to relieve cluster headaches and is also approved for 'typical' migraines in the US.", "authors": ["Alexandra Thompson Senior Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/25/18/18927906-0-image-a-48_1569431118819.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
