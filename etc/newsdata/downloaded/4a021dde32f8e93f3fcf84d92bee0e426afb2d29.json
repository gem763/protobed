Bad things could happen. Someone is going to make an expensive mistake.\u201d\n\n*****\n\nA messaging exchange over a potential $1 million deal, between a European asset manager looking to sell bitcoin and broker Joel Fruhman, illustrates the casual and often chaotic nature of cryptocurrency dealmaking.\n\nTrades involving hundreds of thousands, or millions, of dollars are routinely struck via brief chats on apps like Skype, WhatsApp, WeChat or Zoom, often with scant certainty over the identities of participants or the legal basis of agreements.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d end up in a Zoom call with about five \u2018introducers\u2019 - we didn\u2019t really know who any of them were,\u201d said Fruhman, a physicist by training who started a cryptocurrency brokerage business with his brother Dan in their British hometown of Manchester in 2018.\n\n\u201cAnd who were we? What was our credibility?\u201d\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) trading - buying and selling through a broker - is now beginning to change, however.\n\nIt is moving towards electronic automation as the cryptocurrency sector matures from the province of online enthusiasts to emerging financial assets drawing increasing mainstream interest, Reuters interviews with more than a dozen industry players show.\n\nThis is a fundamental shift, as messaging apps have for years been the predominant platforms.\n\nIt is a key front in attempts by cryptocurrency enthusiasts with roots in the traditional finance industry to drag into the mainstream a singular, largely unregulated sector born on the web a decade ago as a symbol of rebellion against the establishment and offering users near-anonymity.\n\nOTC trading is favoured by big investors like hedge funds because cryptocurrency exchanges often suffer from thin liquidity, and large buy and sell orders can move the market.\n\nBut the opaqueness of the messaging process and its impracticality for use on a large scale, plus the glitches that could cause the \u201cexpensive mistake\u201d warned of by Fruhman, have left it fraught with risk.\n\nNow, as spreads - the differences between bid and ask prices for immediate orders - tighten as liquidity in crypto markets grows, OTC brokers and market makers are seeking to move away from unsophisticated chats and offer quotes electronically, with automated execution and settlement.\n\n\u201cThings have shifted quite rapidly towards electronic trading,\u201d said George Zarya, CEO of London-based cryptocurrency exchange BeQuant, which also runs an OTC desk and is planning to switch towards automation.\n\n\u201cAnything that is liquid \u2013 bitcoin or ethereum \u2013 these markets are going to go electronic. That\u2019s a natural path that traditional markets have gone through.\u201d\n\nThe changes are likely to appeal to larger investors using algorithms and high-frequency trading for whom split-second timings are important, according to the interviews with cryptocurrency OTC brokers, market makers and investors.\n\nAlameda Research, a crypto trader based in California and Hong Kong, launched an almost entirely automated OTC desk around six months ago that is already seeing flows of $20 million-$30 million a day, said Ryan Salame, its Asia-Pacific head of OTC.\n\nFor Salame, the future of OTC trading is electronic, with prices for all but the smallest coins to be quoted electronically.\n\n\u201cThis is just the next step how you stay more competitive. Each desk is trying to be more competitive and making better systems,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a by-product of spreads coming in so much that I can\u2019t update in the chat fast enough to give people the pricing they\u2019re expecting.\u201d\n\n\u2018CAN YOU SELL A FEW MILL?\u2019\n\nThe Fruhman brothers, Joel aged 29 and Dan 28, built a contact book packed with bitcoin miners they met on internet forums and apps as they grew interested in the emerging technology.\n\nMiners use computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles, competing against others and earning rewards in the form of new digital coins. As recently as a few years ago, individual crypto enthusiasts could mine bitcoin from their bedrooms.\n\nBut many had a problem, the Fruhmans found: They were producing bitcoin faster than they could convert them to the cash they needed to clear the hefty electricity bills run up by their high-powered computing gear working overtime.\n\n\u201cWe saw something very clear: A bunch of guys with a lot of bitcoin valued in USD, who had no idea how to turn that into money,\u201d said Joel. \u201cIt started with one request, which was just one of these guys, our mate, who was like: \u2018Can you sell a few mill?\u2019\u201d\n\nLate last year, in an attempt to tap bigger investors and offer more sophisticated back-office services, the brothers swapped their contact book for a stake in a startup run by ex-financiers well-versed in the infrastructure of the financial system, from escrow accounts to settlement systems.\n\nThe startup, BCB Group, then based in London\u2019s financial district, offered something the Fruhmans lacked: regular access to clients from mainstream finance willing and able to buy the regular supply of digital coin offered by their mining contacts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the stoned 22-year-old that we were dealing with a year and a half ago,\u201d said Joel. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not the equity traders, the Goldman Sachs. They\u2019re kind of in between - it\u2019s growing from one into the other.\u201d\n\nTRADE BLOSSOMS IN BITCOIN BUBBLE\n\nGlobal cryptocurrency trading volumes are highly erratic. Over the past year, bitcoin alone - by far the largest coin - has seen daily volumes of between $900 million and $3 billion, according to research firm Coin Metrics.\n\nBrokers estimate the OTC market typically accounts for 10% to 30% of global volumes on any given day.\n\nThe OTC market blossomed as bitcoin\u2019s value soared during its 2017 bubble. That was when miners, wealthy individual investors, hedge funds and companies earning revenue in crypto grew active in the market.\n\nNow, said the industry players who spoke to Reuters, the market is seeing a new shift as the predominance of messaging apps wanes and the more sophisticated tools used in traditional markets like equities and bonds become increasingly common.\n\n\u201cDoing stuff over Skype and over these voice chats is not really scalable,\u201d said Kevin Zhou, co-founder of San Francisco-based OTC desk Galois Capital.\n\nThe evolution is partly being driven by newer entrants to the sector, many of whom are tooled up with cutting-edge tech. Some, like Chicago-based Jump Trading, are from the traditional proprietary trading worlds. Others, such as Alameda Research, specialise in cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnd the changes are popular with big investors.\n\n\u201cI prefer to use electronic because all our algorithms are fully automated,\u201d said Andrea Leccese, president of Bluesky Capital in New York, an investment firm that often runs orders of $5 million-$10 million through OTC desks. \u201cIf we can send our quote electronically to the OTC broker, it\u2019s much better for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say more or less half of OTC trading is going through technical innovation like making fully electronic platform, and that\u2019s even better on our side.\u201d\n\nCryptocurrency regulation is patchy across the world, with curbs on the illegal use of digital coins the priority, and the implications of increasing automation in OTC trading are unclear. But, some market players say, because the changes are likely to attract more mainstream investment they could be a factor in speeding up the introduction of the kind of securities rules seen in traditional markets.\n\nMACHINE VS MAN\n\nWhile increasing automation may be inevitable, many OTC desks are in a bind. Some clients are loath to ditch the personal relationships they have established with their brokers and the apps they use to communicate.\n\nNew York-based Genesis Global Trading sees around $1 billion a month in volume, CEO Michael Moro said. While that\u2019s down from the $2 billion-$2.5 billion a month during bitcoin\u2019s 2017 boom, volumes are now rising between 10% and 20% a month.\n\nGenesis uses TradeBlock, a New York firm that provides tools for trading cryptocurrencies, to execute its deals - but can\u2019t completely abandon messaging apps.\n\n\u201cWe will give market colour over (Skype), but the actual transactions are over TradeBlock,\u201d Moro said. \u201cWhen your clients that are buying $5, $10 million say, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s just chat on Skype\u2019, to get them to change their behaviour and say, \u2018No, we don\u2019t do Skype\u2019, you end up creating a friction.\u201d\n\nFor the Fruhman brothers, personal relationships will remain key.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\n\u201cThe plan is to go to an automated platform, where they\u2019ll be able to request quotes on our front-end website,\u201d said Dan. \u201cBut the interesting thing is that a lot of people actually like the human-to-human interaction.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just \u2018like\u2019,\u201d said Joel, quickly. \u201cIf you\u2019re trading $20 million, you\u2019re not clicking a button - you want to push on the price, you want to get a feel, you want to maybe break it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019ll always be this human OTC component for institutional clients.\u201d", "description": "\"Hi guys, could you please show me a firm bid for 100 bitcoin?\" a seller texts on Skype.", "authors": ["Tom Wilson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428219125&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF890CE", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
