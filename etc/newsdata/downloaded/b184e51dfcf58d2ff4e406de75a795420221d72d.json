Those sources spoke to CBC on the condition of anonymity because they're not authorized to speak about the ongoing court case.\n\nMost of the computers were encrypted \u2014 which is legal but creates potential barriers for the RCMP officers still investigating the case.\n\nOrtis, the 47-year-old director general of the RCMP's national intelligence co-ordination centre, faces multiple charges under the Security of Information Act for allegedly preparing to share sensitive information with a foreign entity or terrorist organization.\n\nHe's also charged with sharing operational information back in 2015.\n\nAccording to documents viewed by CBC, when officers covertly entered Ortis's condo in August they found a piece of paper bearing the words \"The Project\", handwritten and underlined, along with \"John Lemon's blog removing your pdf metadata.\"\n\nDocuments 'sanitized'\n\nThat blog post walks users through the steps in clearing a PDF of its metadata, including the date on which it was created and the program used to make it.\n\nOfficers scanned Ortis's desktop files and determined that between Sept. 8 and Sept. 9 \u2014 days before his arrest \u2014 at least 25 documents \"had been processed and sanitized to remove identifying information,\" according to the documents seen by CBC.\n\nIt's not clear if investigators were able to recover that information.\n\nCameron Ortis at his first court appearance in Ottawa on Friday, Sept. 13.

Caroline Duval in an email to CBC.\n\nOnline data encryption, hailed by privacy advocates, has a been a persistent thorn in the RCMP's side.\n\nFormer CSIS senior strategic analyst Jessica Davis, now president of Insight Threat Intelligence, said encryption often makes investigations harder, but not hopeless.\n\n\"Getting access to the information to figure out what he was doing with those computers will be more challenging because of the encryption piece,\" she said.\n\n\"There are not always workarounds, but even when there are, it takes a long time to implement them.\"\n\nRCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki was warned about the RCMP's inability to keep pace with encryption and organized crime online when she took the reins of the police service last year.\n\n\"Increasingly, criminality is conducted on the internet and investigations are international in nature, yet investigative tools and RCMP capacity have not kept pace,\" notes a memo prepared for Lucki and obtained through access to information.\n\nHer predecessor, Bob Paulson, even lobbied the government for new powers to bypass digital roadblocks, including tools to get around encryption and warrantless access to internet subscriber information.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Ralph Goodale has maintained Canada has to strike a balance between privacy and the needs of law enforcement.\n\nOrtis had access to 'highly protected' information\n\nThe documents shared with CBC say Ortis had material that, if released, would cause a \"HIGH\" degree of damage to Canada and its allies.\n\n\"This type of information is among the most highly protected of national security assets, by any government standard, and goes to the heart of Canada's sovereignty and security,\" notes the report.\n\nThe head of the RCMP said the national police force is working to limit security risks among Canada's intelligence allies and is assessing potential operational damage in the wake of charges laid against one of its top intelligence officers.\n\nSecurity services first got wind of Ortis through a separate probe of Phantom Secure Communications, a B.C.-based company under investigation for providing encrypted communication devices to international criminals, according to the documents.\n\nOrtis, who has been in custody since his arrest Sept. 12, is back in court in Ottawa Friday to set a bail hearing.\n\nThe two other intelligence security agencies, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and the Communications Security Establishment, have so far deferred questions about the case to the RCMP.", "description": "The RCMP\u00a0intelligence director who now stands accused of\u00a0preparing to leak secrets to a foreign entity or terrorist group kept a large number of encrypted computers at his home, making the investigation harder to crack,\u00a0CBC News has learned.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5272426.1567718669!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/175764161.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
