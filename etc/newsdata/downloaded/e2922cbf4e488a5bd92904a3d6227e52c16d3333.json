It cautioned, however, that its statement to the market should be considered as an announcement to make a possible offer and is not confirmation of a firm intention to bid.\n\nThe statement from HKEX said a further announcement will be made \"as and when appropriate.\"\n\nHKEX has proposed \u00a320.45 a share in cash, as well as 2.495 newly issued HKEX shares. LSE shares rallied shortly after 10:00 a.m. London time, rising by 8.5% before giving up some of those initial gains.\n\nIn a subsequent conference call held for media and analysts, HKEX executives described the deal as a means of connecting trading and capital between East and West. They added the deal would create an 18-hour trading zone and also help the rise of the Chinese yuan as a globally-traded currency.\n\nCharles Li, the chief executive of HKEX, played down any tension surrounding a Chinese firm taking control of a strategic U.K. brand with access to sensitive market information.\n\n\"We are not a Chinese company. We are not even a Hong Kong-only company. We are a global company,\" he said.", "description": "Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited said on Wednesday it has made a proposal to the board of London Stock Exchange Group.", "authors": ["David Reid"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/101791016-LSE2.jpg?v=1532564459", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
