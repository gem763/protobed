Sales from cancer treatment Imbruvica rose about 31% to $921 million in the quarter.\n\nThe company on Tuesday said it now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share in the range $8.62 to $8.67, from its prior forecast of $8.53 to $8.63. Analysts were expecting $8.60 per share.\n\nNet earnings rose to $4.83 billion, or $1.81 per share, in the quarter, from $3.93 billion, or $1.44 per share, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding items, the company earned $2.12 per share, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of $2.01 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nTotal sales rose 1.9% to $20.73 billion, above the average analysts\u2019 estimate of $20.07 billion.\n\nPharmaceutical unit sales rose 5.1% to $10.88 billion, above analysts estimates of $10.28 billion, according to a Refinitiv poll of three analysts.", "description": "Johnson & Johnson boosted its profit forecast for the year on Tuesday after posting better-than-expected quarterly earnings on stronger prescription sales of its psoriasis treatment Stelara and cancer drug Imbruvica.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441079968&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0S9", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
