The statement ended with the literary genius: \u2018It\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u2026. Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u2019\n\nRebekah, 37, immediately denied the allegations and has went on to confirm she is getting a \u2018forensic investigation\u2019 on her Instagram account to prove she\u2019s not the culprit.\n\nFormer WAG Danielle Lloyd then got involved, saying she\u2019s had \u2018similar run-ins\u2019 with Becky.\n\nIt\u2019s the dream scandal.\n\nThe WAGs dominated 2006 (Picture: DPA/PA Images)\n\nEngland\u2019s footballers were permitted to bring their partners to Germany (Picture: REUTERS/Dylan Martinez)\n\nCarly Zucker, Alex Curran and Lisa Roughead were among the squad (Picture: Chris Uncle/FilmM)\n\nIt\u2019s also a bit of a throwback, with WAGs suddenly appearing on the cover of every newspaper and at the top of every website. Back in the noughties, the wives and girlfriends of England\u2019s biggest football stars were almost more famous than their other halves, but in the latter half of the decade, their notoriety began to fade into the background.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that can all be pinned down to the 2006 World Cup.\n\nIn 2006, the WAGs (a term coined by the Mail on Sunday) were permitted by then-manager Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson not only to accompany their partners to training camp, but to the actual World Cup in Germany. Out of the 23-man squad, only 19-year-old Aaron Lennon chose not to bring a partner \u2013 meaning 22 WAGs descended on the sleepy spa town Baden-Baden.\n\nThey included David Beckham\u2019s wife Victoria, Ashley Cole\u2019s then-girlfriend and future wife Cheryl, Joe Cole\u2019s then-girlfriend Carly Zucker, Frank Lampard\u2019s then-girlfriend Elen Rivas, Peter Crouch\u2019s then-girlfriend Abbey Clancy, and Wayne Rooney\u2019s future bride Coleen.\n\nColeen joined then-boyfriend Wayne (Picture: PA Archive)\n\nIconic (Picture: Ross Kinnaird/Getty Images)\n\nCheryl accompanied then boyfriend Ashley Cole (Picture: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\nAnd that summer, the WAGs gained even more press than the England team.\n\nThe WAG squad were branded \u2018hooligans with Visas\u2019 by Spanish newspaper ABC as their partying and shopping in between supporting the Lions from the stands made headlines the world over.\n\nThe ladies were pretty iconic to begin with, with Elen Rivas missing her flight after attempting to board with five pieces of hand luggage, and Victoria Beckham apparently taking 30 pairs of jeans with her to Germany.\n\nThe WAGs stayed at the Brenner\u2019s Park Hotel, which cost \u00a31,000 a night, and even the \u00a326,000 they racked up on their rooms wasn\u2019t enough for them. Alex Curran \u2013 the partner of Steven Gerrard \u2013 had to pay extra after being billed for 60 bottles of \u00a375 pink champagne, while Elen spent an extra \u00a32,607.\n\nThe girls made the most of their summer (Picture: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images)\n\nColeen and Alex supported their boys (Picture: ADRIAN DENNIS/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe ladies frequented Garibaldi\u2019s nightclub (Picture: Chris Uncle/FilmMagic)\n\nCheryl and Victoria were firm friends (Picture: PA Archive)\n\nThen came the shopping. Baden-Baden\u2019s Hermes and Gucci branches apparently bought in \u00a3200,000 in extra stock ahead of the WAGs\u2019 arrival, and it more than paid off, as on 19 June, the gang spent \u00a357,000 in just one hour-long shopping trip \u2013 with Coleen herself splashing \u00a3900 in 60 minutes. Alberts sunglasses, boutiques Monica Schol and Gero Mure and jeweller Bijou Brigitte were some of the stores that benefitted from the WAGs\u2019 loose purse strings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there was their time at Garibaldi\u2019s. One of the only nightclubs in Baden-Baden to open outside the weekend, the WAGs chose it as their favourite spot and spent most nights singing karaoke and knocking back champagne and bellinis.\n\nIt was the perfect trip \u2013 until England crashed out at the quarter-finals after losing to Portugal on penalties. Despite a lacklustre performance from the team, many blamed the WAGs for distracting their partners with their antics.\n\nRio Ferdinand said two years later: \u2018If I\u2019m honest, we became a bit of a circus in terms of the whole WAG situation. It seemed like there was a big show around the whole squad. It was like watching a theatre unfolding and football almost became a secondary element to the main event.\n\nElen Rivas tried to bring five pieces of hand luggage on her flight (Picture: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\nAbbey Clancy was the youngest of the WAGs (Picture: Bob Thomas Sports Photography via Getty Images)\n\nRebekah married Jamie in 2016 (Picture: Chris Lobina/Sky via Getty Images)\n\n\u2018People were worrying more about what people were wearing and where they were going out, rather than the England football team. That then transposed itself into the team. That\u2019s said in hindsight\u2026\n\n\u2018At the time, we were caught up in the bubble ourselves. Being somewhere like Baden-Baden, walking around the town, there were paparazzi everywhere, our families were there. When you step back and look back at that, it was like a circus.\u2019\n\nAnd in 2010, manager Fabio Capello banned the WAGs from attending the entire duration of the tournament in South Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAhead of last year\u2019s World Cup, Rebekah Vardy \u2013 who married Leicester hero Jamie in 2016 \u2013 distanced herself from the WAG party girl stereotype.\n\nShe told Fabulous: \u2018The wives and girlfriends have a much lower profile now and that is how it should be. Our job is to be supportive.\n\n\u2018I would be mortified if I was pictured leaving a bar absolutely p***ed knowing that my husband was going to play one of the biggest games of his life the next day.\u2019\n\nBut fast forward 13 years on from Baden-Baden and the WAGs \u2013 and Rebekah \u2013 are back overshadowing their husbands in a very different way.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
