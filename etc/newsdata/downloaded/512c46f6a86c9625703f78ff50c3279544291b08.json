It's not something we can do on our own because we are not a large customer of these types of minerals.\"\n\nAustralia is aiming to develop six critical mineral industries that it sees as key to future technologies and where it has large mineral reserves. These include rare earths as well as cobalt, a key material in electric vehicle batteries, and tungsten and niobium, used in steel alloys.\n\nCanavan said US President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison discussed a joint action plan on critical minerals development when they met earlier this year.\n\nThe resources minister has raised the issue in Japan and South Korea in recent months and is heading to the US for further talks with the government that may include agreements over funding.\n\n\"We are hopeful something will be done by the end of the year,\" he said.", "description": "Australia's resources minister said rare earths mining is seen as a 'national priority'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/6/26/e9f9f80212ea4df69a77aae2b033d027_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
