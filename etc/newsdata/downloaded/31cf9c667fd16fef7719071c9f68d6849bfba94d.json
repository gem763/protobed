Click here to find out how.\n\nToday (Friday): An easterly fetch around 10 mph off the Atlantic will keep us socked in with clouds, but only the slightest shower chance. If you like cooler temperatures, you may like morning upper 60s that top out by late afternoon in the mid-70s or so. Upper 70s are possible if sunshine breaks through before 3 p.m. (earlier than currently expected). We\u2019re close to Oct. 1 average high temperatures, so it could feel a bit clammy and cool in the morning. Confidence: Medium\n\nTonight: Clouds clear a bit and winds should calm slowly each hour, especially nearer dawn, when temperatures bottom out in the mid-60s downtown, perhaps about 60 well away from the Beltway. Look for the special micro-/Friday the 13th/\u201cHarvest\u201d full moon. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nFollow us on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for the latest updates.

But we still get muggy and warm. Dew points could near the upper 60s, so it may not feel comfortable as temperatures climb into the low to mid-80s. A couple of storms are possible by mid- to late afternoon, but nothing too heavy or long-lasting is currently expected. Southerly breezes near 10 mph pump in moisture, making it feel a bit sticky. Confidence: Medium\n\nTomorrow night: A weak cold front may set off some additional late night showers or storms. It\u2019s muggy, and we may not dip below 70 degrees downtown, perhaps mid-60s in the coolest Blue Ridge spots. Confidence: Medium\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nSunday: Sunshine should dominate over most attempts by clouds, with warmth building into the mid- to upper 80s. Slight northwesterly winds are possible, so we may see less humid air move in during the afternoon. Fingers crossed. Shower and storms chances after sunrise should stay minimal and very hit-or-miss, if any. Confidence: Medium\n\nSunday night: Partly cloudy, and fairly calm, with mid- to upper 60s for low temperatures near dawn. It could prove tranquil, with only a slight uptick in humidity levels. Confidence: Low-Medium\n\nModerate mugginess (dew points low to mid-60s) may continue Monday and Tuesday even as temperatures decrease from about 90 on Monday to the low to mid-80s Tuesday. It\u2019s partly to mostly sunny both days, with only a quick hit-or-miss shower or storm possible, as it appears now. Stay tuned to forecast tweaks as we get closer.
