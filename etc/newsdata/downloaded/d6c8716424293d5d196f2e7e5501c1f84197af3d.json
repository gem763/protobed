Conner finished with 41 yards rushing, 78 receiving.\n\nRookie linebacker Devin Bush scored on a fumble return and snagged an interception for Pittsburgh.\n\nLos Angeles' Philip Rivers, under pressure constantly, was 26 of 44 for 320 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. Hunter Henry, who had 100 yards on eight receptions, caught both touchdowns.\n\nPittsburgh defensive end Stephon Tuitt left in the first half because of a pectoral injury.\n\nLos Angeles was driving in the first quarter when, on third down, Rivers threw a slightly backward pass that went off the outstretched hands of Melvin Gordon. Bush pounced on the ball and ran it nine yards to the end zone for a 7-0 lead.\n\nThe Steelers defense struck again right away when, four plays later, Tyson Alualu tipped a Rivers pass and Bush intercepted it and returned it six yards to the Chargers' 40. The ensuing seven-play, 40-yard drive culminated with Conner following a Vance McDonald block 12 yards into the end zone for a 14-0 lead less than 11 minutes into the game.\n\nOn a third-and-8 with 6 1/2 minutes left in the second quarter, Hodges found Conner at the right sideline, and Conner trotted 26 yards for a touchdown and a 21-0 lead.\n\nThe Chargers missed a chance to get on the board when Chase McLaughlin's 43-yard field goal attempt with less than a minute left in the first half bonked off the left upright.\n\nPittsburgh's first drive of the third quarter ended with Chris Boswell kicking a 20-yard field goal to make it 24-0 with 8:12 left in the quarter.\n\nMcLaughlin got another chance one minute into the fourth quarter and hit a 38-yarder.\n\nLos Angeles executed touchdown drives on the following two drives, going 70 yards on 10 plays with Rivers hitting Henry for a 5-yard score to make it 24-10, and 79 yards on eight plays with Rivers hitting Henry for an 11-yard score with 1:29 left.\n\nThe Charges then forced a Steelers punt and had the ball with a minute left, but at their own 1-yard line.\n\nAfter an incomplete pass, Rivers was intercepted by Cameron Sutton to end Los Angeles' hopes.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "James Conner scored one touchdown on the ground and another through the air  Sunday night as the visiting Pittsburgh Steelers tripped up the Los Angeles ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
