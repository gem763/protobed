We promised them the truth. We owe them the truth. And, today, the whole country, the whole world, is finally hearing the truth about what happened,\" he added.\n\nIssues highlighted in the report included:\n\nA lack of training in how to \"recognise the need for an evacuation or how to organise one\"\n\nIncident commanders \"of relatively junior rank\" being unable to change strategy\n\nControl room officers lacking training on when to advise callers to evacuate\n\nAn assumption that crews would reach callers, resulting in \"assurances which were not well founded\"\n\nCommunication between the control room and those on the ground being \"improvised, uncertain and prone to error\"\n\nA lack of an organised way to share information within the control room, meaning officers had \"no overall picture of the speed or pattern of fire spread\"\n\nThe government was committed to publishing and acting on the facts of the fire, \"no matter how difficult they may be\", Mr Johnson said.\n\nThe prime minister is set to lead a debate on the report in Parliament on Wednesday.\n\nThe second phase of the inquiry will focus on wider circumstances of the fire, including the design of the building.", "description": "A new report will be published later on the fire in west London in 2017 which killed 72 people.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07sdwjt.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
