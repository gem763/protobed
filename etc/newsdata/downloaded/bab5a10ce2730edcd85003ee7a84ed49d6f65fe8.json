'It's like, \"how can people have fun doing this?\".'\n\n'I feel a bit overwhelmed. Ideally I'd rather be in a hot country, with sun and sea, compared to rain and sleeping in a tent.'\n\nHattie Garment, 19, from Hemel Hampstead, is a wealthy heiress used to 5 stars hotels and luxury trips. For this week's Rick Kids Skint Holiday on Channel 5, Hattie, pictured on her 18th birthday last year, is went camping\n\nAt first, Hattie found the whole experience of camping 'overwhelming' and said she didn't understand how people can have fun this way\n\nThe young woman was not expecting to be going camping and struggled to cope from the moment the family arrived at Dernwood Farm.\n\nHattie's father funds her lifestyle and her love of labels. She owns a collection of Gucci trainers, heels, Versace blouses, Burberry coats and more.\n\nThe heiress has never had to worry about money in her life, and explained that she can spend between \u00a3500 and \u00a31,000 on makeup and beauty treatments a month.\n\nThe family's last holiday was in the Maldives, and thought it cost a grand total of \u00a38,000 - \u00a32,000 per person - the heiress admitted she found the experience boring.\n\nHattie went camping with the Hayward family. From left to right: Pete and Louise Hayward and their daughters Chloe, four and Katie, seven\n\nOn her first day camping, Hattie struggled to pitch her own tent (pictured) and was so disappointed to be camping that she ended up in tears\n\nFinancially, it's always been smooth sailing for Hattie, whose lifestyle is paid for by her father, which includes a \u00a3500 monthly allowance for travel alone\n\nLater in the day, things became awkward over dinner when Hattie revealed her Gucci trainers cost more than \u00a3700, to a shocked Pete and Louise.\n\n'What you're wearing is five times more expensive than my wardrobe,' Pete joked.\n\nPete, an oven cleaner, and Louise, a weight loss consultant, are both self-employed and sometimes struggle to make ends meet.\n\nThis camping adventure was the Haywards' first holiday as a family, and it took them six months to save up the \u00a3180 fee for the two-nights stay.\n\nLottie found that camping with the Hayward was hard work when the family needed to carry their belongings in trolleys before picking the spots for their tents\n\nAt dinner on the first night, Louise and Pete were astounded to learn that Hattie's shoes cost more than \u00a3700\n\nAnd Hattie didn't do herself any favours by adding that her parents give her a \u00a3500 allowance to cover her commute, even though she is working and earning a salary.\n\nLouise who had set a daily budget of \u00a340 for the trip, did not seem impressed by Hattie's spending habits.\n\n'It's quite tough to know that for some people, it is just that easy,' she said.\n\n'How much would we love to be in that position where we could just have that disposable income.'\n\nAnd while she stayed diplomatic in front of Hattie, Louise opened up further in an aside to the camera.\n\n'It's a little bit uncomfortable to be honest,' she said\n\nHattie was not blind to the mother-of-two's uneasiness, but to her, it was all a matter of perspective.\n\n'She has to think about it in a different perspective because I don't have to worry about certain stuff at the moment,' Hattie said.\n\nOn their first day, Louise, Pete and Hattie and the children went to meet the animals on the farm and feed some pigs some apples (pictured)\n\nThe family and Hattie went bug hunting in the forest thanks to two cheap books Hattie found at the camping site's store\n\nCurious to see whether Hattie would be able to handle a smaller budget, Louise tasked her with finding the family and activity for the afternoon with only \u00a322.50 in her pockets, including food.\n\nFinding she couldn't afford any of the activities around the camping site, Hattie bought a sticker book and a bug-spotting guide for \u00a34.99 and \u00a32.99 in order to entertain the kids.\n\nWith the remaining \u00a314.52, Hattie then tried to cover dinner.\n\nHattie had to make dinner from scratch for the whole family, even making her own fire (pictured)\n\nOverall, she found activities and dinner for the family for \u00a320.23.\n\nShe admitted to being 'pleased with herself,' and was quite happy when the family went on to explore the nearby woods to look for wildlife.\n\nLater in the evening, Pete and Louise opened up to Hattie about how hard their finances make it to deal with Katie's autism diagnosis.\n\n'There are so many activities for kids like her to try, but there's definitely a limit as to what we can do so far with our budget,' Louise explained.\n\n'You probably don't imagine what kind of impact money can have on someone's development,' Louis added, 'because it shouldn't.'\n\nAt the end of the stay, Hattie offered the family a riding lesson for Katie and Chloe to thank them for their hospitality\n\nAt the end of the stay, and after a horse ride for Chloe and Katie, Hattie and the Haywards were the best of friends\n\nAnd indeed, Hattie was shocked by the couple's revelation.\n\n'I never thought money could have this much of an impact,' she said.\n\nThe next day, wanting to pay for a nice activity for the Haywards to do, and touched by their conversation about Katie's autism, Hattie bought the family a trip to the stables, where Katie and Chloe met horses and ponies, an activity recommended for children with autism.\n\nLouise and Pete were very touched by her attention and say she 'couldn't have picked a better treat.'\n\nRich Kids, Skint Holiday airs on Mondays at 9pm on 5Star.", "description": "Hattie Garment, 19, from Hemel Hampstead, appears on 5Star's Rich Kids, Skint Holiday tonight, and is left horrified by having to go camping with Pete and Louise Hayward and their two daughters.", "authors": ["Claire Toureille For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/13/19394170-0-image-a-36_1570449944049.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
