Don\u2019t worry about him.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNo one was more gleeful than Trump to see Johnson\u2019s political ascent on the back of the promised British withdrawal from the E.U., and no other world leader may have as much to lose from the stunning political humiliation of a populist brother-in-arms.\n\nIf Johnson is unable to deliver Brexit on time, or at all, or if he is ousted as prime minister, his rise and fall will be tied to Trump. The president has been willing to look past policy disagreements with Johnson on Iran, climate change and trade protectionism chiefly because of Johnson\u2019s Trump-like rhetoric about the importance of shedding E.U. control, analysts said.\n\n\u201cIt serves Trump\u2019s purpose to continue cheerleading for Boris because he supports Brexit,\u201d no matter Johnson\u2019s political peril, said Amanda Sloat, a Europe specialist at the Brookings Institution.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBoris Johnson suffers two major losses in Parliament, leaving his governing authority and the terms of Brexit in doubt\n\nPence, who has been on a nearly week-long European tour, has found himself in the middle of the Brexit storm. The vice president, who was in Iceland on Wednesday, was scheduled to arrive in London late Wednesday ahead of a Thursday meeting with Johnson.\n\nPence\u2019s message, at stop after stop across Europe, has been that the United States stands with Johnson in his cause, and he has underscored the view that it\u2019s critical for the European Union to negotiate in \u201cgood faith\u201d with the new prime minister. He has notably never leaned on Johnson, who could be critical for a future U.S.-U.K. trade agreement.\n\nWhen asked in Reykjavik on Wednesday whether the Trump administration stands with Johnson amid the Brexit turbulence, Pence made clear that the United States was unwavering as he spoke to reporters outside Hofdi House, the site where Pence\u2019s political hero, Ronald Reagan, once negotiated with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMake no mistake about it: America respects the sovereignty of the United Kingdom, respects the will of the people of the United Kingdom, and we respect and support the U.K.\u2019s decision to leave the European Union,\u201d Pence said.\n\nThe White House looked past the uncertainty to express confidence that trade deals can be reached with both Britain and the E.U. once Brexit is complete.\n\n\u201cThe United States enjoys strong relationships with both the UK and EU and we look forward to continuing both after Brexit,\u201d a senior administration official said in an email. \u201cLooking ahead, as the President has made clear many times, the United States is committed to negotiating a robust trade deal with the UK after the UK leaves the EU. As the President said [at the recent Group of Seven summit] in Biarritz, [France,] we are also optimistic about the chances of concluding a trade deal in the future With the EU.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter on the record.\n\nPence\u2019s travels illustrate better than anything how the United States has forgone any effort to be a mediator or go-between for Britain, Ireland and Brussels, Sloat said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible,\u201d she said. \u201cThe U.S. has just put its thumb so far on one side of the issue.\u201d\n\nWhen Pence arrived in Shannon, Ireland, on Monday evening, he sat inches away from Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney during a meeting at Shannon\u2019s airport that was friendly but quickly drifted away from pleasantries as Coveney pleaded with the vice president for more solidarity with Ireland on Brexit.\n\nAD\n\nCoveney warned of the \u201cdisruption\u201d Brexit could cause Ireland, in terms of rupturing the peace at its northern border, and called it a \u201chuge issue for this country.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe told Pence that Ireland cannot tolerate upheaval at its free-flowing border or new inspection stops and hassles.\n\nPence, ever calm, responded by saying he was \u201cgrateful for your candor.\u201d But he made no explicit assurances about what the United States could promise on the details of Brexit. Instead, he broadly stated that he could \u201cassure you\u201d that the Trump administration would work with the United Kingdom and Ireland on a \u201cBrexit plan that encourages stability\u201d and respects the Good Friday Agreement that maintains peace in Northern Ireland.\n\nAD\n\nAt a Tuesday news conference in Dublin alongside Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, Pence drew audible gasps from members of the Irish media as he generally sided with Johnson\u2019s position on Irish soil.\n\n\u201cAs the deadline for Brexit approaches, we urge Ireland, and the E.U. as well, to negotiate in good faith with Prime Minister Johnson,\u201d Pence said.\n\nAD\n\nVaradkar made clear his government\u2019s concerns.\n\n\u201cWe as a government have to stand our ground\u201d on the Good Friday agreement, Varadkar said. \u201cAll I ask is that you bring that message back to Washington with you.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters later, Pence was pressed on whether he would push for the peace deal to be maintained and make that a priority for the United States.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLet me leave the details to others,\u201d Pence said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to affirm the importance of the Good Friday Agreement, but we really believe that there is an opportunity here, if all parties would come to the table and negotiate in good faith, to achieve a Brexit in a way that honors the sovereignty of the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nIn Iceland on Wednesday, Pence said the United States wants Britain and the E.U. to \u201creach an agreement that will meet the needs of the aspirations of the people of the United Kingdom and also provide for an orderly Brexit.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPence has nodded to the tensions he has faced as the Trump administration\u2019s de facto spokesman in Europe amid Brexit, all as he works to maintain close ties with European nations beyond Britain.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe recognize this is a complex issue,\u201d Pence said Wednesday in Iceland. \u201cDuring our visit to Ireland yesterday, we were reminded of the challenges that the Republic of Ireland faces having a contiguous border with the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nThe unraveling of Brexit added urgency to Pence\u2019s trip, which some of his confidants had hoped would be a showcase of his Irish roots. He brought members of his family, including his mother, on the trip and spent Tuesday night at Morrissey\u2019s pub in Doonbeg, which he once visited as a young man in 1981.\n\n\u201cMay God hold you in the palm of his hand,\u201d Pence said at the conclusion of his Tuesday news conference, in one of several overtures to the Irish.\n\nAD\n\nIrish headlines and columnists nevertheless erupted with ire about the vice president\u2019s handling of the charged moment in Europe.\n\nMiriam Lord, a columnist for the Irish Times, wrote that Pence \u201cwastes no opportunity to go misty-eyed about his love for the \u2018Old Country\u2019 as he lards on his Mother Machree schtick on both sides of the Atlantic.\u201d\n\nBut, she added, \u201cAs Pence read from the autocue and Irish eyes definitely stopped smiling, it was clear he was channeling His Master\u2019s Voice. Trump is a fan of Brexit and of Boris.\u201d\n\nCosta reported from Reykjavik.", "description": "No one was more gleeful than Trump to see Johnson\u2019s political ascent on the back of the promised British withdrawal from the E.U., and no other world leader may have as much to lose from the stunning political humiliation of a populist brother-in-arms.", "authors": ["Anne Gearan", "White House Reporter", "Robert Costa", "National Political Reporter Covering The White House", "Congress"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tX4J8Rz-03Vw1KSsIA9rsRBWFZE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7LGHHUWPJMI6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg"}
