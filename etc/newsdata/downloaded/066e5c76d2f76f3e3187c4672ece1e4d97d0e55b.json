The hotel scene had long been lacking, though, with properties clustered around the soulless Union Square and slightly grubby Tenderloin district \u2013 but in the last decade, a series of new openings spread around the city have livened it up considerably.\n\nToday, you can stay in historic buildings in the shadow of the Golden Gate Bridge, in a new build opposite San Francisco\u2019s baseball stadium, in the midst of America\u2019s oldest Japantown, or on Market Street \u2013 the \"new\" Union Square (it\u2019s handy to get around, though doesn\u2019t have much going on). Whether you prefer to be disturbed by foghorns or drag brunches, there\u2019s something for everyone in California\u2019s most individual city.\n\nThe Independent\u2019s hotel reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust. On some occasions, we earn revenue if you click the links and book, but we never allow this to affect our coverage.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBest for atmosphere: Cavallo Point\n\nNeighbourhood: Marins Headlands\n\nLight sleepers, be warned \u2013 this converted military base at the foot of the Golden Gate Bridge can get pretty noisy at night with foghorns blaring as ships pass under the bridge. Luckily, earplugs are provided, and the atmosphere \u2013 as the bridge sporadically emerges from the fog that swaddles it \u2013 is Hitchcockian enough to forgive the disturbance. On a clear day, the views are superb from the rooms in modern blocks scattered up the hillside (there are also rooms in original buildings, though they don\u2019t enjoy the panoramic views). In keeping with its Marin Headlands location (the pristine land opposite the city), this is a seriously green resort, with specially designed window flows in place of air conditioning, eco toiletries, and wild deer gadding about the marram grass-filled grounds.\n\nDoubles from $450 (\u00a3360), room only\n\ncavallopoint.com\n\nBest value: Kimpton Buchanan\n\nNeighbourhood: Japantown\n\nFifteen minutes but a world away from Fisherman\u2019s Wharf, San Francisco\u2019s Japantown \u2013 America\u2019s largest and oldest \u2013 is quiet, authentic and tourist free. The last bit explains why you get so much bang for your buck here \u2013 this gorgeous hotel is about half the price of anything around Union Square (and the environs are considerably nicer). It\u2019s beautifully understated with calm modern rooms enlivened with Japanese touches like guest kimonos, calligraphy art on the walls and in-room easels. The in-house restaurant, Mums, has been going strong for nearly four decades with its Japanese-American menu.\n\nDoubles from $179 (\u00a3143), room only\n\nthebuchananhotel.com\n\nBest for the Bay: Inn Above Tide\n\nNeighbourhood: Sausalito\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to keep you at this luxe B&B, floating on the opposite side of the San Francisco Bay in Sausalito. First, there are the views \u2013 every room overlooks the water, whether that\u2019s towards Alcatraz, Angel Island, the city, or all three. Then there\u2019s the comfort \u2013 some have fireplaces, others decks lapped by the water, but all have the kind of swoonably plush beds that only American B&Bs seem to get. Finally, there\u2019s the food \u2013 trays stacked high with everything from pastries to eggs served to your room in the morning, and evening sessions of California cheese and wine. You\u2019re just minutes away from the ferry to the city, but you may find yourself on it less than you\u2019d expect.\n\nDoubles from $515 (\u00a3337), B&B\n\ninnabovetide.com\n\nBest for views: Loews Regency (soon to be Four Seasons)\n\nNeighbourhood: Financial District\n\nNot many hotels in San Francisco have a setting like this, namely, the top 11 floors of one of the city\u2019s highest buildings, in the heart of the Financial District. Perhaps that\u2019s why so many hotel groups have wanted a piece of it \u2013 it opened as a Mandarin Oriental, then switched to Loews, and at the start of 2020 it\u2019ll be refurbished and reopened as a Four Seasons. The rooms might change \u2013 though they\u2019re already slick and marble-drenched \u2013 but the 40th floor bar is going nowhere, and neither are the views \u2013 of the city, the Bay, the Golden Gate Bridge, and Oakland. There\u2019s no need to upgrade for the view here \u2013 they\u2019re all superb.\n\nDoubles from $333 (\u00a3260), room only\n\nloewshotels.com, fourseasons.com\n\nBest vibes: The Red Victorian\n\nNeighbourhood: Haight Ashbury\n\nThe Summer of Love centred round Haight Ashbury, bordering Golden Gate Park, and while the neighbourhood has moved on (though it\u2019s still a bit alternative), the Red Vic is a time capsule of that era. Founded by hippie Sammy Sunchild as a hotel and peace caf\u00e9, it\u2019s now a community-run \u201cexperimental hostel\u201d with 22 ensuite and shared bathroom rooms, all roughly hippie- or San Francisco-themed (think \u201cflower child\u201d and \u201cJapanese tea garden\u201d after the garden in the park), plus small dorms. The caf\u00e9 is gone but regular lectures and group meet ups downstairs keep the community involved.\n\nDoubles from $60 (\u00a349), ensuites from $80 (\u00a365), room only\n\nredvictorian.com\n\nBest for peace and quiet: Inn at the Presidio\n\nNeighbourhood: Presidio Park\n\nOn the city side of the Golden Gate Bridge in the thickly wooded Presidio Park, this Georgian Revival-style former military barrack has been transformed into a peaceful 22-room hotel (17 of which are fireplace-equipped suites). An annexe, the Funston House \u2013 a former officer\u2019s home \u2013 has a further four rooms, which can be rented individually or as a whole. The rooms, all different, range from retro military cast-iron bedsteads to tasteful modern affairs of leather furniture and plush high headboards, while views range from the surrounding forest to glimpses of the Golden Gate Bridge from the top floor. Although this shares elements with Cavallo Point, it\u2019s a much smaller, more B&B-like affair \u2013 there\u2019s no restaurant, but they lay on breakfast and Californian wine and cheese every night.\n\nDoubles from $310 (\u00a3251), room only\n\npresidiolodging.com\n\nBest boutique: Proper Hotel\n\nNeighbourhood: Mid-Market\n\nA surprising 131 rooms have been squished into this slender flatiron building from the early 20th century on Market Street, the tram-lined main thoroughfare which slices through the city (but doesn\u2019t have a huge lot going for it, sightseeing-wise). Much fanfare was made when it opened in 2017 for its design credentials: there\u2019s a mid-century feel as patterned wallpapers clash with the patterned blinds, patterned bedspreads, patterned pillows and patterned rugs. This is hipster central \u2013 toiletries are by Aesop, bikes by cult Detroit brand Shinola are available to guests, and the entry level rooms feature oh-so-cool walnut bunk beds. But the real draw is the v-shaped rooftop bar, Charmaine\u2019s.\n\nDoubles from $215 (\u00a3172), B&B\n\nproperhotel.com\n\nBest for budget: Yotel\n\nNeighbourhood: Mid-Market\n\nAnother one on Market Street, this 2019 opening sits in a building dating back to 1904, overlooking the tramlines. Yotel is of course known for its pod-style rooms and although this is more \"hotelly\", space is still kept to a minimum \u2013 the beds flip up into a seated position to provide more space. Rain showers and smart TVs are par for the course, and while the entry-level rooms are windowless, the other categories range from bi-level, loft-style spaces to premium and corner rooms, which are more traditional hotel rooms overlooking other heritage buildings. If you\u2019re set on sightseeing and don\u2019t intend to laze around back at base, this is great value. A rooftop bar is on the way, too.\n\nDoubles from $150 (\u00a3120), room only\n\nyotel.com\n\nBest for bling: Sir Francis Drake\n\nNeighbourhood: Union Square\n\nThis is unexpected for San Francisco: an unashamedly sumptuous hotel, built in the roaring 1920s, which harks back to the glory years of ye olde England. The public areas are wonderfully OTT, stuffed with marble and gold leafed within an inch of their lives, while hand-painted murals and Beefeater-dressed doormen give the nod to the British theme. Up the grand wrought-iron staircase are the bedrooms \u2013 modern, but still with a hint of glam, from the scarlet chests of drawers to the rococo-style headboards. On Sundays, this is home to the city\u2019s best brunch: Sunday\u2019s a Drag, where your food is accompanied by a superb drag show. The only issue with this hotel? Its location, near hotel hub Union Square, which has chain stores but little of the San Francisco atmosphere you\u2019ve travelled for.\n\nDoubles from $179 (\u00a3143), room only\n\nsirfrancisdrake.com\n\nBest for a local feel: Hotel Via\n\nNeighbourhood: South Beach\n\nDown on South Beach \u2013 near nightlife area SoMa and en route to the trendy Mission \u2013 this new-build hotel sits opposite Oracle Park, the baseball stadium that\u2019s home to the San Francisco Giants. Not that you\u2019ll be bothered by the fans here \u2013 the swanky 3,000 square foot rooftop lounge, complete with firepits and cabanas, is for guests only. The bar downstairs is open to the public \u2013 and appreciated by them on game days. Rooms are chic boutique \u2013 think crisp white colours and neat stools instead of desk chairs \u2013 and front-facing ones have views across the water towards Oakland.\n\nDoubles from $229 (\u00a3183), room only\n\nhotelviasf.com", "description": "The best hotels in San Francisco, from hip boutiques to city centre luxury properties, as chosen by our resident expert.", "authors": ["Julia Buckley"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/16/15/san-francisco.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
