YouTube screenshot\n\nSingapore has come in 21st again on an annual ranking of \u2018soft power\u2019 among 60 countries worldwide.\n\nIt did extremely well for business-friendliness and digital infrastructure, but poorly on art, film, music, and sport.\n\nOnly three other Asian countries made it into the top 30: Japan, Korea and China.\n\nDespite producing no popular anime or leggy girl groups, little Singapore is among the top three countries with the most soft power in Asia, according to an annual report by communications consultancy Portland.\n\nThe Soft Power 30 report, published on Thursday (Oct 24), scored 60 countries worldwide on six soft power indices: culture, education, engagement, digital, enterprise and government.\n\nIt also polled 12,500 nationally-representative respondents from 25 countries for their views on each country\u2019s cuisine, livability, friendliness, foreign policy, tech products, luxury goods, and global culture.\n\nIt then combined both scores and compiled the top 30 countries to form its ranking.\n\nRead also: Singapore has great restaurants, too bad it\u2019s also stressful and unexciting: Time Out poll\n\nIn top place this year was France, followed by the UK, Germany, Sweden, and the US.\n\nMost of the countries in the top 30 were from Europe, with just four from Asia: Japan (8th place), South Korea (19th), Singapore (21st) and China (27th).\n\nSingapore \u2013 which maintained its 21st place ranking from last year \u2013 was 19th place in 2016.\n\nFor the fourth year running, Singapore came in top place in the enterprise category for its good business environment, talent pool, high foreign direct investment, and number of patents.\n\nIt also came in eighth in the digital category thanks to its digital infrastructure and online government services, which the report attributed to the Government\u2019s Smart Nation initiative.\n\nRead also: 4 years after losing top spot, Singapore remains 2nd on ranking of world\u2019s easiest place to do business\n\nWhile Singapore\u2019s poll score was boosted by the Trump-Kim summit and the success of Crazy Rich Asians, it still ranked among the bottom for most indices, especially engagement and culture.\n\nThe engagement category considered the number of embassies a country had, its membership in multilateral organisations, and its contributions to overseas development aid.\n\nMeanwhile, the culture category looked at the number of Michelin-star restaurants, UNESCO World Heritage sites and Olympic medals a country had, as well as tourist spending, the reputation of its national airline, and the number of local films and music albums popular in other countries.\n\nRead also: Singapore officially submitted its hawker culture nomination to Unesco with celebratory photos and videos \u2013 but some Malaysians aren\u2019t too happy about it\n\nThe study\u2019s lead author, Jonathan McClory, said the republic needed to \u201cdouble down on efforts to showcase its rich and diverse culture\u201d if it hoped to improve its overall rank.\n\n\u201cSingapore is a multi-racial, multi-religious society, with a unique blend of cultural influences. The bicentennial did an excellent job of showcasing Singapore\u2019s history as a multi-cultural society, but this was largely domestically-focused. Singapore\u2019s strengths in diversity should be weaved into its global narrative, and shared with audiences around the world,\u201d he added.\n\nMcClory said Singapore performed well on tourism and food, but lagged behind in art, film, music, and sport.\n\nFormer diplomat Bilahari Kausikan added that the country\u2019s main soft power was its culture of \u201cclear, enforced rules\u201d on trade, finance, and dispute resolution.\n\n\u201cSingapore has worked over decades to build up its hard power capabilities, precisely because we recognise the limits of soft power,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cSingapore has known since independence the precarious position of small states in a large and dangerous world. As such, we have always had to take a hard-edged, realist view of the world.\u201d\n\nRead also: Trump-Kim Summit: Singapore will pay S$20 million bill despite playing host \u2013 and believes the benefits will outweigh the costs", "description": "Business Insider - Major cultural events, like the success of Crazy Rich Asians, helped to push up Singapore's international visibility..
