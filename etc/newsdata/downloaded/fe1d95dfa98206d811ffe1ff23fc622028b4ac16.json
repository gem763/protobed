The advance pared this year\u2019s decline to 27%.\n\nMusk, 48, has made a habit of sending end-of-quarter staff emails to rally the troops pursuing production and delivery goals. If Tesla were to hand over 100,000 vehicles each of the last two quarters of the year, deliveries would roughly reach the low end of the 360,000 to 400,000 range the company has forecast for 2019.\n\nThe blog Electrek reported on Musk\u2019s email earlier Thursday. While Tesla reported more than 95,000 deliveries for the second quarter, demand was driven by the lower-margin Model 3 sedan, and the carmaker posted a bigger loss than analysts expected.\n\nA six-digit-delivery quarter would be an achievement that still leaves Tesla a long way from rivaling the world\u2019s biggest automakers. For perspective, General Motors Co. sold about 110,000 Chevrolet Silverado pickups in the second quarter just in the U.S.\n\nIn the third quarter, Tesla began delivering the Model 3 to new markets including Australia. Overseas expansion could help offset the headwind caused by the shrinking federal tax credit U.S. buyers were eligible for as of July.\n\nMusk touched on the logistical difficulty of getting cars to consumers in his staff memo.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is making sure that we have the right car variants in the right locations and rallying as much of our company resources as possible to help with end of quarter deliveries,\u201d the CEO wrote.\n\n(Updates with closing share price in third paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Josh Eidelson.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Dana Hull in San Francisco at dhull12@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Craig Trudell at ctrudell1@bloomberg.net, Kevin Miller\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. shares climbed the most since June after Elon Musk said in an email to employees that the carmaker has a chance to top the vehicle-delivery record it set in the second quarter.\u201cWe have a shot at achieving our first 100,000 vehicle delivery quarter,\u201d Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive", "authors": ["Dana Hull"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hfw0gFGmWDj8AX7uJh4mDw--~B/aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/81f5a4ae0dfa52e932623c289311c15a", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
