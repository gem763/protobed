Katie Hill resigns amid ethics probe", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Freshman Rep. Katie Hill, a rising Democratic star in the House, announced her resignation Sunday amid an ethics probe, saying explicit private photos of her with a campaign staffer had been \u201cweaponized\u201d by her abusive husband and political operatives.\n\nThe California Democrat, 32, had been hand-picked for a coveted leadership seat. But in recent days, compromising photos of Hill and purported text messages from her to a campaign staffer surfaced online in a right-wing publication and a British tabloid.\n\nThe House ethics committee also launched an investigation into whether Hill had an inappropriate relationship with an aide in her congressional office. Hill has denied that.\n\n\u201cIt is with a broken heart that today I announce my resignation from Congress,\u201d she wrote in a statement released Sunday, adding that her resignation is effective Friday.\n\n\u201cHaving private photos of personal moments weaponized against me has been an appalling invasion of my privacy. It\u2019s also illegal, and we are currently pursuing all of our available legal options,\u201d she added. \u201cHowever, I know that as long as I am in Congress, we\u2019ll live fearful of what might come next and how much it will hurt.\u201d\n\nLast year, Hill won a Republican-held seat near Los Angeles. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi picked Hill for a leadership post.\n\nHill said she is divorcing her husband. She is one of the few openly bisexual women in Congress.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Freshman Rep.
