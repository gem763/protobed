A later forecast had Dorian\u2019s eye riding up Florida\u2019s middle for a time, putting nearly the entire state on alert.\n\nDorian\u2019s ultimate path is challenging to predict, meteorologists and hurricane researchers say, because the hurricane and others like it are guided by many ever-changing elements.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re at the mercy of what\u2019s happening around them,\u201d said Matt Lanza, managing editor of Space City Weather, a blog that tracks hurricanes and weather in Texas and along the Gulf Coast. \u201cI\u2019m constantly amazed at just what one little, tiny change can do to the whole picture.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts How closely have you been paying attention to predictions about Dorian? Join the conversation below.\n\nAmong the biggest factors are the pressure systems and wind currents, like the trade winds or the jet stream, that steer a storm.\n\nMichael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, said both were at play with Dorian, especially as it interacted with a high-pressure ridge over the western Atlantic. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to predict, four or five days out, precisely how strong that ridge will be, where precisely it will be, and thus where precisely the storm will be directed.\u201d\n\nThe amount of time a hurricane spends moving over warm surface water is also a factor. The warmer the water, the more intense a hurricane becomes.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the fuel to a hurricane,\u201d said Lance Wood, meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s National Hurricane Center.\n\nAs Dorian hits the Bahamas, expected sometime Sunday, forecasters predict the storm will decelerate and linger, slowing to just 2 miles per hour. That would be a devastating prospect for the islands.\n\n\u201cYou get more rainfall, you get a longer period of time exposed to the wind and the surge,\u201d Mr. Wood said.\n\nTimothy Hall, a senior scientist at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said hurricanes appear to be slowing down and stalling more. He defined stalling as any storm that spends at least 48 hours in a 200-kilometer (124-mile) radius. Mr. Hall said it was hard to know why storms were stalling more frequently. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re at the edge of what we understand.\u201d\n\nUnless the models shift again, Dorian is expected to continue northward and make a turn toward the right.\n\nDr. Hall said just how much damage Dorian does to coastal communities will depend a lot on the timing of that turn.\n\n\u201cIs it going to do it before it makes landfall in Florida?\u201d he asked. \u201cA six- or eight- or 12-hour difference in when it makes the turn makes all the difference.\u201d\n\nWhatever Dorian does, federal officials cautioned those in the storm\u2019s path to remain vigilant.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really critical that folks in the Carolinas down to central Florida continue to pay very close attention to Dorian, not get complacent, remain vigilant, and take action now,\u201d David Bibo, deputy associate administrator for response and recovery at FEMA, said Saturday.\n\nWrite to Erin Ailworth at Erin.Ailworth@wsj.com", "description": "The ultimate path of Hurricane Dorian is challenging to predict, experts say, because the storm and others like it are guided by many ever-changing elements.", "authors": ["Erin Ailworth", "Erin.Ailworth Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103174/social"}
