So people who turn 65 in the future won\u2019t be able to enroll in Medicare supplement Plan F, the most popular and expensive Medigap insurance plan that retirees buy to cover costs Medicare doesn\u2019t cover.\n\nPeople already in Plan F will be allowed to stay, but insurance experts think they may be surprised in the future by high premiums. There is also speculation that costs could rise sharply for people in Plan G, which is similar to Plan F but requires people to pay an annual deductible\u2014currently $185, although it rises annually.\n\nBarron\u2019s explored the closing of Plan F and a variety of details in a recent article, but readers had many more questions. Here, answers to some of those inquiries:\n\nQ: I\u2019m 69 and my wife is 65. I still work and we are both covered by my employer. I had planned to wait until I retire in 2-3 years to buy a Medicare supplement. Since Plan F won\u2019t be available any longer, should I opt out of my employer\u2019s coverage and get Medicare coverage while it is still permissible for people to buy Plan F?\n\nA: Even if you wait for two or three more years, you are not going to be locked out of an extensive Medicare supplement. Plan G will be available and it is very comprehensive, requiring no co-pays or costs other than your annual deductible. So there is no need to jump into Medicare now simply based on fear of missing out on complete health coverage. Since you are already 65, you might even be allowed into Plan F in the future if you stay healthy.\n\nThat said, people over 65 who are still working and have employer insurance should consider whether their workplace plan or Medicare would be a better deal. That means analyzing what is covered with both approaches and how much you pay.\n\nElaine Floyd, a certified financial planner who advises other planners on Medicare, said that workplace plans often provide better drug coverage\u2014possibly a reason to stay. Medicare supplements don\u2019t cover prescriptions. Medicare rules require people to buy a drug plan, even if they take no drugs, as soon as they leave an employer plan. Drug plans vary in price, based on needs.\n\nSo to consider whether your employer plan or Medicare Plan F is a better deal, look at what you pay for your employer insurance from your paychecks, add in your annual deductible and likely co-payments for doctors, hospitals, and labs.\n\nCompare that total to what you would pay to be on Medicare Part B with supplement insurance Plan F: To be on Medicare: you pay $135.50 a month per person, or higher for couples with incomes over $170,000. Then comes Plan F premiums\u2014maybe from $170 to $300 per person a month depending on your state and insurance company. Then comes a drug plan\u2014maybe around $30 a month if you take few drugs or potentially a lot more with extensive prescriptions. Do the math for you and your wife.\n\nQ: I am in plan F and can\u2019t decide whether I can afford to stay until I know my 2020 premiums. If I wait, I might miss the deadline that comes in 2019. When will I know my 2020 premium?\n\nA: Rules on premiums are set by states, but insurance companies generally raise premiums\u2014based on a person\u2019s age\u2014each year. There is no specific date, though Jeff Goldman, an insurance agent in Skokie, Ill., said insurance companies typically will inform people about 45 days from the anniversary of when they enrolled in the plan the previous year.\n\nAlso, relax about the 2019 deadline. It doesn\u2019t apply to people like you, who already are enrolled in Medigap insurance plans. You can switch policies at any time of the year, but only if your health is acceptable to an insurance company.\n\nQ: Does Plan F or Plan G have the healthiest members?\n\nA: This is a key question for the costs people will pay if they stay in Plan F or Plan G in the future because the make-up of the pool of retirees in each plan is expected to change.\n\nCurrently, about 60% of people who choose Medicare supplements are in Plan F, so there is a variety of people in the plan. But after the end of this year, when there won\u2019t be 65-year-olds coming into the plan, the pool of people remaining is expected to become older and sicker. Some insurance experts think that as that happens, insurance companies will have to raise premiums substantially to cover all the medical costs.\n\nJared Strock, of CSG Actuarial, however, says insurance companies can try to insulate themselves somewhat from the trend by enticing healthy people over 65 to switch from other Medicare supplements or Medicare Advantage Plans into Plan F. He says some companies are already cutting premiums to encourage these moves.\n\nMeanwhile, Plan G\u2014which has attracted healthy shoppers who wanted the comfort of extensive coverage at a cheaper cost than Plan F\u2014will face a different client pool. After 2020 begins, anyone who is 65 or coming into Medicare for the first time after working past age 65 will automatically be allowed into Plan G if they want it. Many will be healthy. But insurance experts think that more unhealthy people with a lot of health-care needs will pick Plan G in the future for the security of having all their costs covered and the ability to go to doctors anywhere. Recently, Aon found that Plan G costs about $150 a month compared with about $186 for Plan F. After 2020, Strock thinks Plan G premiums will drift close to Plan F\u2019s.\n\nQ: Can an expatriate get Medigap?\n\nA: Some Medigap plans, including Plan F and Plan G, partially cover medical emergencies abroad. But people living abroad should look into specific insurance designed for expatriates.", "description": "Barron\u2019s recently explored the closing of Medigap Plan F, the Medicare supplemental insurance plan, but readers had many more questions.
