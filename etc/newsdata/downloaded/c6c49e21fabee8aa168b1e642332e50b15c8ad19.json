Here are select dispatches about the companies responding to customer demands and climate risk, the ESG investors, and the policy-makers and scientists preparing for tomorrow.\n\nNot-so-smart sorting creates global recycling meltdown. There\u2019s a recycling reflex gripping many well-intentioned consumers, reports Mother Jones. Labeled as \u201cwishcycling\u201d by the waste-management industry, most trash tossers are recycling too much, assuming their empty tube of toothpaste or glossy-coated gift box \u2014 really anything small that seems like it should be recyclable \u2014 will be sorted downstream at the materials recovery facilities, or MRF. But, ultimately, much of what is \u201crecycled\u201d doesn\u2019t qualify and can burden these centers. According to Marian Chertow, director of the Solid Waste Policy program at Yale University and cited by Mother Jones, \u201ca wishcycler wants to do the right thing and feels that the more that he or she can recycle, the better.\u201d\n\nIn the early 2000s, to get more residents to recycle, many communities switched from a dual-stream system, where plastics and glass, and paper and cardboard, each had their own bins, to single-stream, in which all recyclables go into one bin and the sorting is done at the MRF, with soggy or spoiled recyclables tossed out, the article details. In defense of consumers, it\u2019s not always clear what can and cannot be recycled, or recycled together. The mixed materials are overwhelming the system. And now China, which had been a huge U.S. plastic purchaser, has restricted what materials it will take; its policy change could displace an estimated 111 million metric tons of the world\u2019s plastic waste by 2030, according to the report.\n\nRead: Where the 2020 Democrats stand on climate change\n\nThere\u2019s been a push for standardized federal recycling guidance. For now, rinsed plastic containers and glass bottles, cardboard, and beverage and food cans are almost always acceptable. Plastic bags, electronics and food-soiled paper generally are not. But for consumers, maybe the old mantra needs an update: Don\u2019t just recycle \u2014 reduce and reuse.\n\nAnd: Prince Harry to launch massive travel sustainability initiative\n\nCompost has huge potential to change trash management, but it\u2019s flawed. As companies struggle to deal with the challenge of single-use packaging, compostable options are becoming more common. The system, though, is beginning to change, including new innovations in materials, according to this Fast Company feature. \u201cThese are solvable problems, not inherent problems,\u201d says Rhodes Yepsen, executive director of the nonprofit Biodegradable Products Institute, in the piece. If the system can be fixed \u2014 just like the broken recycling system needs to be fixed \u2014 it can be one piece of solving the bigger problem of growing trash. It\u2019s not the only solution.\n\nYepsen says that it makes sense to start by reducing packaging and prioritizing reusable products, and then design whatever\u2019s left to be recyclable or compostable depending on the application. But compostable packaging makes particular sense for food; if both food and food packaging can be composted together, it could also help keep more food out of landfills, where it\u2019s a major source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.\n\nRead: New York Times drops decades-old sponsorship of oil conference, citing climate change\n\nThis could be more bad news for bananas. In the coming decades, 10 countries where bananas are grown could be negatively impacted, including major suppliers India and Brazil, by climate change. Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Panama and the Philippines could also suffer, says a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change.\n\nSince the 1960s, shifts in the climate have in fact boosted the growth of bananas in some regions, but hindered it in others. But if the current trend of global warming continues, farms may struggle to grow the same amount of bananas in coming years, researchers Varun Varma and Daniel Bebber of the University of Exeter predict.\n\nAccording to a separate study cited by the authors, the fruit is among the top 10 crops in the world when it comes to cultivation, yield, and calories produced. More work to explore the impact climate change on these crops is needed, Varma and Bebber wrote. Earlier this year, a separate study found climate change could help the spread of a fungus, known as Black Sigatoka, which affects bananas.\n\nYes, you use palm oil. Palm oil is used in everything from cosmetics to food to soap, but its production from biodiversity-sapping palm oil plantations in tropical rainforests is increasingly controversial. According to the largest player in the sustainable palm oil industry, Sime Darby Plantation, the companies that buy it often don\u2019t then make its inclusion clear on product labels.\n\nStill, more companies are signing up to comply with a standard known as \u201csustainable\u201d palm oil, as BBC environment correspondent Claire Marshall explains. There is a generally-agreed global standard set by the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Environmentalists worry that compliance is too slow, but they also generally concede that strong demand for palm oil and less-than-perfect alternatives mean that even a slow route to sustainability is the better path. Alternatives are sunflower oil, or rapeseed, or coconut. But palm oil is far more productive, yielding up to ten times more oil from the same amount of land. Put it another way: ten times more land would be needed to grow these other crops to get the same amount of oil, Marshall writes.\n\nAnd: Australia lowers Great Barrier Reef outlook to \u2018very poor\u2019\n\nOpinion: About the Amazon rainforest fires \u2014 let\u2019s separate fact from fiction", "description": "Dispatches from the business of climate change.", "authors": ["Rachel Koning Beals", "News Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ604_recycl_ZG_20190903155339.jpg"}
