A psychologist, Kristen Bouchard (Katja Herbers), is recruited to work with two representatives of the Catholic Church (\"Luke Cage's\" Mike Colter, and sidekick Aasif Mandvi), who are charged with investigating cases with supernatural overtones, hopefully to avoid the need for exorcisms or declaring them miracles.\n\nWhat sounds painfully familiar -- in a \"A priest and a psychologist walk into a police station\" sort of way -- proves unexpectedly compelling. Because it's at that point where the \"House\" side takes over, since the emphasis is on deciphering what might be responsible for strange phenomena and seemingly inexplicable conditions, along scientific lines, identifying the often-obscure causes in ingenious fashion.\n\n\"Evil\" maintains an exceptionally eerie tone throughout, leaving seeds of doubt. The show also features the always-reliable Michael Emerson as a presence who might be a demon or merely a sociopath, but in any event seeks to bedevil the investigators. (Emerson played a good guy in \"Person of Interest,\" but as fans of \"Lost\" will remember, he excels when his creepy side comes out.)\n\nThe show does dribble in personal details and backstory about its three principals, and introduces Christine Lahti as Kristen's mom, who helps out with her kids. There's also tension and chemistry between the leads, a longstanding tradition of these sort of TV pairings.\n\nRead More", "description": "CBS drama tries to scare up viewers with 'X-Files'-like premise, with Mike Colter and Katja Herbers as a priest in training and psychologist investigating the paranormal", "authors": ["Brian Lowry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190923093015-evil-cbs-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
