Japan is poised to join the club.\n\nBloomberg reports Japan Lines Up to Join Germany in All-Negative Yield Curve Club. Yields in the Asian nation are already negative all the way out to debt maturing in 15 years, and buyers from home and abroad have been snapping up longer-tenor Japanese government bonds, adding to the downward pressure. International investors are profiting by lending dollars for yen via currency forward contracts and plugging the proceeds into JGBs, while domestic players benefit from the slope of the yield curve by borrowing over a short time frame and putting the money into longer maturities where yields are higher. \u201cInvestors are seeking to buy 30- and 40-year bonds while there are positive yields left,\u201d said Tadashi Matsukawa, head of fixed-income at PineBridge Investments Japan Co. \u201cThey face the possibility that yields across all maturities will fall into negative territory.\u201d\n\nNo Brainer\n\nTo Infinity and Beyond\n\nWhy stop at 30 years or even 40 years?\n\nWhy not offer perpetual bonds with a negative yield?\n\nNegative Yields Fundamentally Impossible\n\nNegative yields are fundamentally impossible in the absence of central bank manipulation or monetary fraud.\n\nThat is not an opinion, it is a statement of fact. It is impossible for someone to prefer 89 cents ten years from now to a dollar today.\n\nYet, I see some people whom I respect attempt to explain the matter.\n\nDeflation Ahead\n\nWhy buy German 10-years at -60 bps? Well, core inflation in Germany typically falls 330 bps in a recession. The current core is 1.2%. So that means deflation lies ahead and as such generates a de facto expected \u201creal\u201d yield of +1.5%. That\u2019s why. \u2014 David Rosenberg (@EconguyRosie) August 21, 2019\n\nI agree that deflation is ahead, but I am sorry, that's not a valid excuse to buy negative-yield debt.\n\nCurrency Component\n\nOne of my readers commented \"You are forgetting the currency component.\"\n\nThat statement is in apparent \"carry trade\" sympathy with Bloomberg's \"No Brainer\".\n\nExcuse me for pointing out there is no risk-free arbitrage.\n\nCarry trades blow up all the time and the next one will be a doozie. I expect many hedge funds will blow up on these kinds of bets.\n\nLogically Impossible\n\nLet's not equate speculative activity with the fundamental impossibility of someone actually preferring 89 cents ten years from now to a dollar today.\n\nThat is precisely what Swiss bond yields imply.\n\nYet, Rosenberg made the same rationalization as my reader.\n\nSafekeeping\n\nAgain, note out the difference between safekeeping services and negative interest rates.\n\nOne would expect to pay a small nominal storage cost for gold (or cash).\n\nBut if one lent gold (or cash), as opposed to placing it in a bank for safekeeping, the yield would never be negative or zero. Never.\n\nThat one might choose to speculate in negative yield bets via carry trades or the greater fool's theory does not negate this simple fact: Time preference can never be negative except by central bank manipulation and outright monetary fraud.\n\nUnderstanding the Point\n\nWe are getting closer to seeing perpetual zero-coupon bonds. So literally: the promise to never pay you back anything. \u2014 Christophe ?? (@Chris_A_CH) August 23, 2019\n\nQuestion of Fraud\n\nAnother reader commented,\n\n\"I don't understand how negative interest rates are fraudulent. The bond issuer is promising to pay fewer dollars upon maturity than the buyer is spending to purchase the bond. There is no fraud.\"\n\nOf course there is manipulation and fraud.\n\nOnce again, Interest rates could never be negative without central bank manipulation.\n\nThe ECB engaged in massive QE, printing money out of thin air, forcing banks to take the money, then setting rates negative robbing banks of earnings. That's a huge fundamental mistake and it has backfired already.\n\nIf you do not like the word fraud, call it robbery. It is not much different than the playground bully demanding money in return for the right to walk to class unmolested.\n\nBanks have to take the offer. In return, we are now seeing things like banks charging consumers for deposits. Negative interest rates on deposits rob depositors because they are forced upon them.\n\nIf something that cannot logically happen, actually happens, look for manipulation and fraud as the obvious explanation.\n\nWhat's Happening?\n\nTo create \"excess reserves\" central banks, via asset purchases, flood banks with dollars (euros or yen) the banks do not even want because banks believe they cannot lend them profitably.\n\nIn the case of the ECB, the central bank charges the banks interest on the euros crammed down their throats.\n\nMathematical Certainty\n\nIn Europe, the US, Japan, and everywhere, it is a 100% mathematical certainty that someone has to hold every dollar, every euro, every stock, and every bond 100% of the time.\n\nPlease read that two or three times until it sinks in.\n\nSomeone must hold every security and every dollar. One cannot sell stocks and buy bonds without someone else doing the opposite.\n\nGiven there is a seller for every buyer, only the ownership transfers.\n\nManipulation, Fraud, or Theft?\n\nIn this case, the ECB prints euros the banks do not even want, yet someone has to hold the damn things, 100% of the time come hell or high water, no matter what interest rate the ECB sets.\n\nThen the ECB charges the banks interest on the money printed out of thin air while simultaneously setting the short-term rate negative.\n\nThis has destroyed Eurozone bank profitably. In contrast, the Fed paid interest rates on excess reserves, slowly bailing them out over time.\n\nMaking Sense of It All\n\nOne can label these central bank strategies manipulation, theft, or fraud.\n\nSelect the term that suits you best.\n\nBut that is the correct way of Making Sense of 100-Yr Bonds yielding 0% and 30-Yr Bonds With Negative Yield.\n\nAlso, please consider Fed Baby Steps Coming: What's Powell Up To?\n\nMy short answer is the Fed wants to avoid the Eurozone negative rate trap.", "description": "The entire German yield curve is negative for 30 years. .09/02/2019 3:23:34AM EST.", "authors": ["Mike Shedlock", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/292/71f421d2-3cfd-4f3f-b118-969bf8add258.jpg"}
