The event, called \u201cDream in Dior,\u201d was intended to get students interested in careers with the company\u2019s Chinese branch.\n\nOne of the students attending the presentation questioned why self-ruled Taiwan, which Communist China claims as a rogue province, was not included in the map. A video of the encounter was soon uploaded to Chinese social media.\n\nThe ensuing events chronicled by the South China Morning Post will be familiar to anyone who has studied Beijing\u2019s hypersensitivity about the autonomous and semi-autonomous areas within its sphere of influence. According to the Post:\n\nAt first, the employee explained Taiwan was too small to be shown. But after it was pointed out that the much smaller Hainan island was included, the employee explained that Taiwan and Hong Kong were only included in Dior\u2019s presentations on \u201cGreater China\u201d. The explanation sparked fury among Chinese internet users. \u201cNot a single part of China should be missing!\u201d said one comment on Weibo. \u201cThat employee should be fired immediately,\u201d a second read. Another online user wrote \u201ca major brand crossing the line with China again, when will they learn?\u201d The \u201cDior statement\u201d is now the second most popular search term on the Chinese social media platform.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that the individual staff member made the mistake and they do not represent Dior\u2019s stance, but this shows the company has problems in management and supervision. China\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty are sacred and inviolable!\u201d declared a typical Chinese critic of the company.\n\nThe logical inference that including Taiwan on a map designed to get students excited about working for Dior\u2019s branch in China would be pointless if those students had very little interest in moving to Taiwan never seemed to enter the discussion.\n\nAs with other companies pressured by China, Dior blamed the incident entirely on the \u201cpersonal misconduct of an employee\u201d and promised to \u201cdeal\u201d with that person after a \u201cdiligent investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cDior always respects and maintains the one-China principle, strictly maintains China\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity and values Chinese people\u2019s feelings. We\u2019re deeply concerned about the individual staff member\u2019s mistake and will definitely learn from the incident and avoid similar mistakes,\u201d the company said in a groveling apology triumphantly relayed by Chinese state-run media.\n\n\u201cWe accept [Dior\u2019s] apology. But remember to deal with the staff member. Plus, please teach your staff about China\u2019s geography. Don\u2019t always blame your staff for any mistake. Don\u2019t make any mistake more than three times,\u201d responded a social media user quoted approvingly by Chinese state media.", "description": "China extracts an apology from French fashion house Christian Dior for using a map that did not include Taiwan as Chinese territory.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-77433848-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
