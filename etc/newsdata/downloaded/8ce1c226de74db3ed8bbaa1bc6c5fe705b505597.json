Nobody wants each game affected by a Zapruder-like review of every pass play looking for interference.\n\nBut there\u2019s going to be some confusion along the way.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nCarolina Panthers coach Ron Rivera thought he would get a defensive pass interference call when he challenged a big play late in Thursday night\u2019s game. His receiver was impeded on a downfield route.\n\nAnd Rivera was upset when the non-call on the field stood.\n\nPanthers have unsuccessful PI challenge\n\nJust before the two-minute warning, with the Panthers trailing 20-14, Curtis Samuel ran a stop-and-go route against Buccaneers cornerback Carlton Davis. Davis was fooled and hit Samuel as he tried to get deep. There was some question if Cam Newton had released the ball before Davis\u2019 contact \u2014 it\u2019s pass interference if the ball is in the air and illegal contact if it\u2019s not, and illegal contact isn\u2019t reviewable \u2014 but referee Jerome Boger didn\u2019t offer much explanation on the field for the call.\n\nRivera was upset. Television cameras saw him yelling at officials after the call was made following the review.\n\n\u201cI think Ron has a real legitimate argument here,\u201d Fox officiating analyst Mike Pereira said on the broadcast. \u201cI think if that is called pass interference on the field, there is no argument whatsoever on it.\u201d\n\nNew rule hasn\u2019t had big impact\n\nThe new rule was made after an instantly infamous non-call on a blatant pass interference in the NFC championship game cost the New Orleans Saints a trip to last season\u2019s Super Bowl. Fans worried about how the rule would be implemented.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo far, it hasn\u2019t had much impact. A graphic on the broadcast said there have been eight pass interference challenges through 17 games this season, and only two calls were overturned. It seems officials will be careful about changing their calls on the field when it comes to pass interference.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be controversies. The Panthers clearly felt they had a good challenge on Thursday night. But for some reason, they didn\u2019t get the call.\n\nCarolina Panthers head coach Ron Rivera argues with an official.
