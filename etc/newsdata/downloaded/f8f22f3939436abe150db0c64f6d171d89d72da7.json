You cannot fight fire with fire,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said in his daily press conference on Friday morning. \u201cWe do not want deaths. We do not want war.\u201d\n\nBut the aborted arrest \u2013 and the chaos that it unleashed \u2013 prompted accusations that the government had simply folded in the face of cartel firepower, and cast further doubt on the president\u2019s efforts to overhaul Mexico\u2019s security strategy.\n\nRelated: El Chapo: Mexican police capture then release drug boss's son after battle with cartel\n\n\u201cThere is nothing admirable about this decision,\u201d the security expert Alejandro Hope tweeted on Friday morning. \u201cBy launching a badly planned operation that was then badly executed, the government laid itself open to being blackmailed.\u201d\n\nCarlos Bravo Regidor, a professor at the Centre for Research and Teaching in Economics, tweeted: \u201cFirst it was an operational disaster. Then it was communications disaster. And finally it was a political disaster.\u201d\n\nAccording to the official version, Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez was detained in a house in Culiac\u00e1n between about 3pm and 5.30pm on Thursday, triggering a huge and extremely violent response from the cartel which led the authorities to withdraw from the house \u2013 leaving him behind.\n\n\u201cThe capture of a criminal cannot be worth more than the lives of people,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said.\n\nMen look at burnt vehicles after heavily armed gunmen waged an all-out battle against Mexican security forces in Culiac\u00e1n, Sinaloa state, Mexico, on Friday.

What there was was a failed operation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a rushed operation in which the reaction of the criminals was not taken into consideration.\u201d\n\nThe scale of that reaction stunned Mexicans, as footage shared on social media showed heavily armed cartel gunmen in the streets with panicked residents fleing to a soundtrack of gunfire. At least eight people were killed and 21 wounded in the clashes.\n\nHundreds of cartel gunmen were deployed around the city of one million people, blocking streets with burning vehicles or riding about on pickup trucks with mounted .50 calibre machine guns. Durazo said that there were 14 separate attacks on the military and 19 roadblocks were thrown up across the city.\n\n#ULTIMAHORA\n\nDetienen al hijo de El Chapo Guzm\u00e1n, Iv\u00e1n Archibaldo Guzm\u00e1n, lo que est\u00e1 ocasionando una fuerte balacera en #Culiac\u00e1n #Sinaloa en esta ciudad pic.twitter.com/MjqqLsu3sx\n\n\u2014 LaGaceta.me (@LaGaceta_me) October 17, 2019\n\nVideos also showed dozens of escaped prisoners flooding into the streets and commandeering passing vehicles at gunpoint. On Friday morning the local authorities confirmed that 49 prisoners were still at large.\n\nAdding to the confusion, authorities were slow to communicate with the panicked population, offering no explanation or comment beyond calling on people to stay indoors.\n\nThe government, however, is struggling to convince observers that it does not bear responsibility for creating the problem in the first place.\n\nOfficials said it was triggered by the \u201cprecipitated\u201d action by members of a patrol that launched into an operation to arrest Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n, on a warrant with a view to extradition, without first having secured a judicial order allowing them entrance to the house.", "description": "Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said security forces saved lives by releasing jailed kingpin\u2019s son after his brief capture in Culiac\u00e1nMexico\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, has insisted that his government was right to release one of the sons of imprisoned drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, a", "authors": ["Jo Tuckman In Mexico City"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Gfcp32AO4Pat2BbQmQ0snQ--~B/aD0zMDA7dz01MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/3f2ffd6ae184c43c2a6e9e128518fd44", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
