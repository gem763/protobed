In the interview, LaRavia described a recent comedy sketch they had been in.\n\n\u201cAs I look at my fianc\u00e9e across the room I can see her that night, she had on a pair of blue coveralls and she had put some black paint all over her face and we were acting out this skit called \u2018cigar butts,\u2019\u201d LaRavia said in the interview.\n\nIvey, 74, who is white, said in a statement on Thursday she does not remember the skit but that, based on the radio interview, it would have occurred at a Baptist Student Union party.\n\n\u201cEven though Ben is the one on tape remembering the skit - and I still don\u2019t recall ever dressing up in overalls or in blackface - I will not deny what is the obvious,\u201d Ivey said.\n\n\u201cAs such, I fully acknowledge \u2013 with genuine remorse \u2013 my participation in a skit like that back when I was a senior in college,\u201d she said.\n\nAlabama State Representative Juandalynn Givan, a Democrat and an African-American, called on Ivey to resign, according to local media outlet AL.com.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t accept her apology,\u201d Givan was quoted as saying by AL.com.\n\nBut Alabama Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, a Democrat who also is African-American, told AL.com he thought Ivey\u2019s apology was sincere.\n\nVIRGINIA CONTROVERSY\n\nSix months ago, Virginia politics were thrown into turmoil when a racist photo emerged from a 1980s medical school yearbook for the state\u2019s Governor Ralph Northam, a Democrat.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Alabama Governor Kay Ivey signs into law the Alabama Human Life Protection Act, after both houses of the legislature passed the bill, in Montgomery, Alabama, U.S., May 15, 2019.

He later changed his story here saying he did not believe he was pictured, but had performed in blackface to impersonate the singer Michael Jackson at about that time.\n\nVirginia Attorney General Mark Herring, 57, also a Democrat, admitted in February that he wore blackface at a party in the 1980s.", "description": "Alabama Governor Kay Ivey acknowledged on Thursday she wore blackface during a college skit in the 1960s and she apologized for the episode, becoming the latest U.S. politician to be embarrassed by a racially-charged incident from decades ago.", "authors": ["Alex Dobuzinskis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190829&t=2&i=1424181195&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF7S291"}
