The champions arrived here with their backs against the wall having lost to Wolves before the international break and with Liverpool sailing off into the distance. If that was not bad enough, Pep Guardiola was then forced to deploy a team containing no recognised centre-backs due to a combination of illness and injury.\n\nAnother defeat looked possible but instead City showed their class and defiance, playing brilliantly and withstanding a late assault by Crystal Palace to cut the gap to J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side to five points.\n\nThe game was won in the first half thanks to Gabriel Jesus\u2019s 50th goal for City and David Silva\u2019s finish soon after. Palace, who came into this contest in decent form, tried their best to harm their opponents but the truth is they were outclassed.\n\nVAR chaos distracts from Pochettino\u2019s relief as Spurs\u2019 Alli pegs back Watford Read more\n\nGuardiola is perhaps the only man in world football who could put out a team containing no central defenders yet some would argue he had no choice given the absence of Aymeric Laporte due to a long-term knee injury and Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi\u2019s unavailability because of the back strain he sustained on international duty. John Stones was back from a thigh injury but he was put on the substitutes\u2019 bench by Guardiola, meaning Rodri lined up alongside Fernandinho in a defence also lacking Kyle Walker due to illness.\n\nThe question was whether a Palace side, containing three changes from the team that won at West Ham, would seek to attack City\u2019s patched-up defence. But that is hardly the recognised way of Roy Hodgson\u2019s side and the truth was that City were simply in no mood to be so accommodating.\n\nThe visitors, as is their way, dominated possession and territory from the outset, pressing high up the pitch using the ball quickly and with purpose. Bernardo Silva was particularly impressive, as was Kevin De Bruyne on his return from a groin injury. The pair combined to test Palace\u2019s defence on 16 minutes before the latter forced Wayne Hennessey \u2013 making his first league appearance of the season in the absence of the injured Vicente Guaita \u2013 into a diving save.\n\nCity were rampant going forward while at the back Fernandinho and Rodri were doing a decent job of snuffing out the occasional attacks Palace were able to put together. It felt a matter of time before the champions scored and they eventually did so twice in the space of three minutes. Jesus struck first with a diving header before David Silva hit a close-range volley past Hennessey following a lovely piece of build-up play that saw City work their way from one end of the pitch to the other in six passes.\n\nMarcos Alonso breaks the Newcastle resistance to give Chelsea narrow win Read more\n\nIt was a flattening few minutes for Palace and particularly so given they contributed to their own downfall. Jesus was left completely unmarked for his goal and the second came from Jordan Ayew\u2019s loss of possession. City continued to dominate proceedings in the second half and came close to increasing their lead on 52 minutes via a shot from Raheem Sterling that clipped the post after travelling through Joel Ward\u2019s legs.\n\nPalace had a shot of their own through Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 but it sailed well over and, in general, the hosts were offering next to no threat. Hodgson reacted by bringing Andros Townsend on for Jeffrey Schlupp on 55 minutes but, not surprisingly, there was no tactical shift to go with it and one could only wonder if the manager was considering bringing on Christian Benteke to play alongside Ayew and properly test City\u2019s reworked defence.\n\nAt the other end of the pitch, there was a use of VAR on a day it had well and truly come under the spotlight. It was deployed after Anthony Taylor had declined to give City a penalty following Wilfried Zaha\u2019s shove on De Bruyne. Michael Oliver checked it at Stockley Park and replays suggested he would have been wise to overturn the call, but he did not. Cue no surprise in the slightest.\n\nBenteke was finally sent on in the 75th minute and it came close to being an inspired change when, with his first touch, he met a corner with a firm header that looked to be going in only for Ederson to claw the ball onto the bar.\n\nThat chance arrived during Palace\u2019s first genuine period of pressure, one that forced Ederson into another good save from Zaha\u2019s drilled effort.", "description": "A pair of quickfire first-half goals earned Manchester City a 2-0 victory at Crystal Palace that closes the gap to Liverpool to five points", "authors": ["Sachin Nakrani"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85b233acc7201c7ee1c768a6f81860a74b9f0289/0_96_3935_2361/master/3935.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=48dcb1e48e74d28e249c199ba38d5df3", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
