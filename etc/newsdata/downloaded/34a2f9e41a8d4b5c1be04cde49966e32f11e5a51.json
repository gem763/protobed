Some think the new film featuring the comic villain origin story is worthless garbage, while the brilliant critic Rex Reed wrote that the movie \u201cborders on genius \u2014 repellent, dark, terrifying, disgusting, brilliant and unforgettable.\u201d\n\nOf course, the movie doesn\u2019t have anything to do with Mr. Trump and doesn\u2019t explicitly cross over into the world of politics. But that hasn\u2019t kept liberals from declaring that the movie is all about him \u2014 or at least \u201cthe America that gave us Trump.\u201d\n\nFilmmaker Michael Moore came out of the woodwork to say the film is an anti-Trump screed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the America that gave us Trump \u2014 the America which feels no need to help the outcast, the destitute. The America where the filthy rich just get richer and filthier,\u201d he wrote on Instagram.\n\n\u201cOur country is in deep despair, our constitution is in shreds, a rogue maniac from Queens has access to the nuclear codes,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYes, there\u2019s a disturbed clown in that mirror, but he\u2019s not alone \u2014 we\u2019re standing right there beside him. \u2018Joker\u2019 is no comic book movie. The film is set somewhere in 1970s Gotham/New York City, the headquarters of all evil: the rich who rule us, the banks and corporations whom we serve, the media which feeds us a daily diet \u2018news\u2019 they think we should absorb.\u201d\n\nCNN went one step further. In an op-ed from Sunday titled \u201c\u2018Joker\u2019 \u2014 a political parable for our times,\u201d writer Jeff Yang goes to extraordinary lengths to connect the movie to Mr. Trump, with repeated declarations that Trump is racist.\n\nThe piece notes that the main character, Arthur Fleck (Phoenix), is \u201cbrutalized by young thugs. He\u2019s beaten by suit-clad Wall Streeters.\u201d But to Mr. Yang, it\u2019s all about race and class. \u201cAnd his answer to this dual pincer of oppression by people of color and one-percenters is a murderous rampage of revenge, which catches fire among fellow angry citizens of Gotham and sends them looting through the streets.\u201d\n\nThen he jumps to Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cWhile many reviewers have focused on Fleck as an \u2018incel\u2019 hero \u2014 his status as a sexless loner who turns to violence \u2014 the true nature of the movie\u2019s appeal is actually broader: It\u2019s an insidious validation of the white-male resentment that helped bring President Donald Trump to power. \u2018Joker,\u2019 at its core, is the story of the \u2018forgotten man,\u2019 the metaphoric displaced and disenfranchised white man whose goodwill has been abused and whose status has been reduced. A man who has been crushed underfoot by the elite, dragged down by equality-demanding feminists and climbed over by upstart nonwhite and immigrant masses,\u201d he concludes.\n\nThe writer also notes that director Todd Phillips has attacked the \u201coutrage culture\u201d of the \u201cfar left,\u201d quoting him as saying: \u201cGo try to be funny nowadays with this woke culture. So I go, \u2018How do I do something irreverent Oh, I know, let\u2019s take the comic book movie universe and turn it on its head.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Yang goes on to declare that \u201cafter watching \u2018Joker,\u2019 it\u2019s easy to decode what Phillips really meant in this quote\u201d going on to compare it to what he said \u201cfired \u2018SNL\u2019 cast member Shane Gillis meant when he excused his repeated use of racist, misogynist and homophobic slurs as \u2018pushing boundaries.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt draws from the same well of resentment that Trump strums with his racist rhetoric at his rallies \u2014 the fear of no longer being at the center of the political, social and cultural universe, with everyone who isn\u2019t you positioned at its perceived edges. (After all, being racist, sexist and anti-gay only \u2018pushes boundaries\u2019 if you define yourself as \u2018normal\u2019 and define nonwhite, non-male and non-straight people as marginalized outsiders.),\u201d Mr. Yang claims.\n\nMr. Yang then all but declares Trump is \u201cJoker.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump won by using outrageous statements, theatrical posturing and grimacing mockery to generate raucous mob energy \u2014 the very opposite of law and order. White men, in particular, responded to his rhetoric and persona \u2014 seeing in him a disruptor of oppressive correctness who could lead them back to the top of the heap and the center of the world,\u201d he writes.\n\nThen the writer goes even further:\n\n\u201cAt the end of the movie, a triumphant Fleck \u2014 seemingly dead, but magically revived by the cheers of a throng of clown-masked rioters \u2014 does a grotesque soft-shoe on top of a shattered cop car, literally dancing on the destroyed remains of the rule of law. Imagine Fleck as Trump, shrugging off impeachment, rebounding with his roaring red-hatted supporters, winning reelection against every prediction and probability.\u201d\n\nIt seems impossible, but liberals see Mr. Trump in everything. Or at least the sufferers of TDS do.\n\nAnd that\u2019s every bit as scary as \u201cJoker.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times.
