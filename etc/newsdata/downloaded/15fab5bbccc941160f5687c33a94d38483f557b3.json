REUTERS/Stringer\n\nGlobal benchmark Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 fell by 34 cents, 0.6%, to $59.57 a barrel by 0350 GMT.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures were down by 12 cents, or 0.2%, to $53.81 per barrel.\n\nIn the third quarter, China\u2019s economic growth slowed to 6% year-on-year, its weakest pace in27-1/2 years and below expectations, dogged by soft factory production amid ongoing trade tensions with United States and sluggish domestic demand.\n\nCrude demand growth tends to closely follow economic growth.\n\nThe slowing economic growth superseded China\u2019s record refinery throughput in the minds of investors, as analysts expect there is little the world\u2019s second-largest oil user can do to stimulate its economy.\n\nRefinery throughput in September rose 9.4% from a year earlier to 56.49 million tonnes, on increases from new refineries and as some independent refiners resumed operations after maintenance.\n\nAlthough China\u2019s third-quarter GDP growth was slightly below expectations, Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, said it was not \u201ca shock to traders and oil trading volumes are low,\u201d as the weak data had been expected.\n\nAdding to the downward pressure, U.S. crude oil stockpiles surged last week as refinery output dropped to a two-year low, while gasoline and distillate fuel inventories decreased, the Energy Information Administration said on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of tough time for markets because we have questions about supply and demand. Last night\u2019s EIA data was a bit of surprise,\u201d said McCarthy.\n\nU.S. crude inventories increased by 9.3 million barrels in the week ended Oct.11, compared with analysts\u2019 expectations for an increase of 2.9 million barrels.\n\nElsewhere, the joint technical committee monitoring a global deal to cut output between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and partners, including Russia, found compliance with cuts for September stood at 236%, according to four OPEC sources.\n\n\u201cConcerns about softer growth in the demand for oil and doubts about OPEC\u2019s ability to rebalance the market on the current production cut rate will be key drags on prices in the near term,\u201d ANZ Research said in a note.\n\nOPEC and its allies have agreed to limit their oil production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2020.\n\nOPEC lowered its 2019 global oil demand growth forecast to 0.98 million bpd, while leaving its 2020 demand growth estimate unchanged at 1.08 million bpd, according to OPEC\u2019s latest monthly report.", "description": "Oil prices fell on Friday after China, the world's largest oil importer, recorded its weakest quarter of economic growth in nearly three decades, dragged down by a trade dispute with the United States.", "authors": ["Jane Chung", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442098840&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H02B", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
