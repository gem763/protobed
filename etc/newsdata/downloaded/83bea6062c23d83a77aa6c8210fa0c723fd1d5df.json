The embryos were perfectly healthy, not deformed in any way and most have gone on to live a normal adult lifespan.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"What has probably happened is she has gone into a nest to lay her eggs where another female had already laid her eggs which had been covered with sperm by a male stickleback.\n\n\"Somehow some of the sperm in the nest must have got into Mary, presumably through her egg tube, and fertilised the eggs inside her but she never laid the eggs.\"\n\nThe three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, is a small fish that is common to both fresh and coastal waters in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nStickleback breeding has been the subject of long-term research. Males change colour during the breeding season - becoming bright red below.\n\nFemales develop eggs and become swollen with them. A breeding male that encounters such a female immediately performs a zigzag dance.\n\nThe two enter into a complex interaction that ends with the male leading the female into an already prepared nest - where she lays her eggs and in turn he fertilises them.\n\nSticklebacks eat small crustaceans and insects. During the breeding season, some males specialise in sneaking into nests and eating the eggs of other males. Others go around in schools and raid nests for the same purpose.", "description": "The incident is the first known case of the development of babies inside a normally egg-laying species following internal fertilisation", "authors": ["Mark Waghorn", "Image", "Getty Images Picture Press Rm", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14025024.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Three-spined-stickleback.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-20"}
