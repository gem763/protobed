(Image: Netflix)\n\nManors are built to be haunted, so far as TV and film is concerned, and The Haunting of Bly Manor, Mike Flanagan\u2019s awaited follow-up to The Haunting of Hill House, now has a cast to do the haunting.\n\nOver the past few days, Flanagan has been tweeting up a storm, slowly unveiling a series of exciting new additions to the cast of the upcoming Netflix show. Let\u2019s run them down.\n\nFirst, a couple we already knew about: Henry Thomas (E.T.), and Kate Siegel, returning from the original series, and also Mike Flanagan\u2019s wife, fun facts.\n\nI'm beyond thrilled to announce that the inestimable, irreplaceable, invaluable Henry Thomas has joined the cast of THE HAUNTING OF BLY MANOR. \u2014 Mike Flanagan (@flanaganfilm) August 28, 2019\n\nAnother returning cast member will be Catherine Parker, who played Poppy Hill. Flanagan also announced a whole slew of exciting new faces.\n\nT\u2019Nia Miller (Doctor Who) will join the show in a lead role, as well Rahul Kohli, who I adore on iZombie. We\u2019ll also see Amelia Eve (Big Boys Don\u2019t Cry), and playing Miles and Flora, two major characters, will be Benjamin Ainsworth and Amelie Smith.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of SUPERGIRL or iZOMBIE, get ready for the remarkably charming RAHUL KOHLI, one of new leads. @RahulKohli13 \u2014 Mike Flanagan (@flanaganfilm) August 30, 2019\n\nAnd if you know THE TURN OF THE SCREW, you know how critical the characters of Miles and Flora are... I\u2019m so grateful that we found BENJAMIN AINSWORTH and AMELIE SMITH, who will be amazing in these crucial roles. \u2014 Mike Flanagan (@flanaganfilm) August 30, 2019\n\nThis is a big cast for what looks like a strong followup. The Haunting of Bly Manor, based on Henry James\u2019 The Turn of the Screw, is coming up sometime in the future.", "description": "Manors are built to be haunted, so far as TV and film is concerned, and The Haunting of Bly Manor, Mike Flanagan\u2019s awaited follow-up to The Haunting of Hill House, now has a cast to do the haunting....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "Adam Clark Estes"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/pqyedgv5b2d9yc8jnypv.jpg"}
