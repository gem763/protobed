An additional 12 civilians were wounded and were hospitalized in Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province, Akhund said.\n\nThe civilian deaths occurred during the second of two raids undertaken in different areas of Musa Qala, Attahullah Afghan, head of the provincial council, said.\n\nThe operations killed 22 Taliban fighters, including foreigners, Afghanistan\u2019s defense ministry said in a statement. Fourteen people were arrested, including five Pakistani nationals and one Bangladeshi. The statement said a large warehouse of supplies and equipment was also destroyed.\n\n\u201cThe foreign terrorist group was actively engaged in organizing terrorist attacks,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe U.S. military said no Afghan or U.S. forces were killed.\n\nThe raids came after a drone attack last week in eastern Afghanistan\u2019s Nangarhar province blamed on U.S. forces killed at least 16 and wounded tens of others, most of them civilians. U.S. forces said that attack was targeting Islamic State militants.\n\nAlso, in an insider attack at the Kandahar airport, a policeman turned his weapon against foreign forces, according to a provincial official who spoke on condition of anonymity, because he was not authorized to talk to media.\n\nThe violence comes as Afghanistan prepares for presidential elections on Saturday, a vote the Taliban vehemently oppose. The Taliban are at their strongest since their ouster in 2001 and hold sway over more than half the country, staging near-daily, deadly attacks across Afghanistan. The insurgent group has warned Afghans not to vote in the election and said their fighters would target election campaigns as well as polling stations.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Anti-Taliban raids by Afghan forces backed by U.S. airstrikes killed at least 40 civilians attending a wedding party in the southern Helmand province, Afghan officials said.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rahim Faiez"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/afghanistan_97931_c0-164-5052-3109_s1770x1032.jpg?74a5713a2d8669a675a4875f9c815cb1769b5931", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
