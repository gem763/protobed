Opposition parties want one too \u2014 but not quite yet.\n\nSeveral more days of parliamentary game-playing lie ahead, but with his majority now shot to pieces by defections and his own sacking of 21 Conservative MPs who voted against him Tuesday, Johnson is out of options.\n\nWhereas his predecessor Theresa May endured repeated humiliations in search of a compromise, Johnson's combative attempt to force a resolution has so far left him with a bloody nose. After losing key votes which saw MPs launch a bid to change the law in order to force the prime minister to ask Brussels for a Brexit delay, Johnson risks being unable to deliver on his promise to quit the EU by the end of October without a high-stakes move.\n\nDowning Street has calculated that an election on a Brexit \"do or die\" ticket will regain a House of Commons majority and enable the prime minister to take the U.K. out of the European Union on whatever terms he wants, including no deal if necessary. They are confident they will get their vote, even if the precise parliamentary route still looks tenuous.\n\nA two-thirds majority is needed in the House of Commons for an early election.\n\n\u201cIf parliament is unwilling to put Brexit through an election is the only way to do it \u2026 [but if he loses] we will find a way to deliver on what the British people want, which is to deliver Brexit by October 31,\" a No. 10 spokesman said.\n\nJohnson, who like David Cameron and Theresa May before him wants to settled the EU question once and for all, could still be remembered as the prime minister who \u2014 by gambling it all at the ballot box \u2014 lost Brexit.\n\nIt's a high-risk strategy with no guarantees. Any election could result in a majority government determined to take the U.K. out of the EU on October 31 with or without a deal; it could produce a government determined to hold a second referendum, potentially keeping the U.K. in the EU after all. Or it could mean yet more deadlock.\n\nWhat is certain is that the campaign would be defined from first to last by Brexit and the deep divisions it has opened up in British society. As one of its key actors, Nigel Farage, told emboldened supporters at a rally Wednesday night \u2014 far from the debates of Westminster \u2014 that the old British party system has become \"old hat.\"\n\n\u201cWe are now Leavers or Remainers \u2014 they are the divisions in British politics,\" he said.\n\nElection sooner or later\n\nAs expected, MPs on Wednesday rejected Johnson's first attempt at calling an early election, which he is now openly backing after parliament initiated legislation that would force him to delay Brexit if he has not secured a deal by October 19.\n\nA two-thirds majority is needed in the House of Commons for an early election and the opposition Labour Party will not give their backing until a legal change blocking a no-deal Brexit has gone through, leader Jeremy Corbyn said Wednesday.\n\nOpposition MPs \u2014 who have done nothing to hide their contempt for Johnson during two dramatic first days of the new parliamentary term \u2014 do not trust him not to fix the date of the election for after the current Brexit date, thereby dragging the U.K. out of the EU with no deal, despite Johnson's insistence he would go to the polls two weeks before Britain is scheduled to leave. \u201cI have absolutely no faith in anything the current prime minister says,\" the Labour MP Jess Phillips said in one of Wednesday's most impassioned speeches in the House of Commons.\n\nCorbyn's team is clear he wants an election as soon as no-deal Brexit is taken off the table. Whether that happens this week depends on whether a government attempt to filibuster in the second chamber, the House of Lords, succeeds. Some in Labour are pushing for the party to hold out for longer, until after the Brexit extension mandating a delay until January 2020 has come into force. But one way or another Johnson indicated he would ask Corbyn again soon, calling on Labour to \u201creflect on what I think is the unsustainability of this position overnight and in the course of the next few days.\u201d\n\nFarage factor\n\nThe key \"wildcard\" looming over any early election is Nigel Farage's Brexit Party, according to one Johnson-supporting former Cabinet minister.\n\nFarage could yet prove Johnson's best friend or his worst enemy.\n\nAt a rally in Doncaster, in the north of England, on Wednesday night \u2014 held as MPs were debating Johnson's election motion \u2014 Farage said he believed an election was inching closer, and laid out what must be a tempting offer for the prime minister, predicting a \"massive, massive majority\" for a Conservative-Brexit Party pact \u2014 but only if Johnson were to commit to a no-deal Brexit as \"the only way.\"\n\nHe heaped praise on Johnson for \"having the guts\" to sack the 21 Conservative no-deal rebels, to rapturous applause from supporters.\n\n\"Politics is changing: An audience in Doncaster clapped Boris Johnson, it\u2019s remarkable!\u201d Farage observed of the crowd in resolutely Labour-voting Doncaster.\n\nIf, however, Johnson continues to pursue a deal with the EU \u2014 still his public position \u2014 Farage has pledged to stand candidates in \"every single seat in the country\" against him. While Farage \u2014 and many Tory MPs \u2014 think the Brexit Party could be as damaging to the Labour vote in Leave-voting areas as it is to the Tory vote, the outcome of the European election, where May's Conservatives fell to fifth place, with Farage topping the poll, looms very large in Johnson's thinking.\n\nSwinson to the left of me, Farage to the right\n\nBut joining with Farage by going hard for no deal is not a fail-safe election strategy for the prime minister.\n\nDoing so could drive potential Conservative voters worried about the impact of no deal into the hands of other parties.\n\nThe pro-Remain Liberal Democrats, who are eyeing some key marginal Conservative seats in the south-west of England and elsewhere, are especially bullish, after improved poll performances in May's local elections and then a second-placed finish behind the Brexit Party in the European election the same month.\n\nUK NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nThe arrival of new leader Jo Swinson has coincided with a membership surge of more than 35,000 since the local elections, and millions of pounds of new funding pledged to party coffers, a Lib Dem official said. The party has gained three MPs in as many months through defections from Labour and the Conservatives, and represents a serious threat to Johnson's majority.\n\nFor pollster Joe Twyman, director of Deltapoll, the Brexit Party and the Lib Dems would be \"two sides of the same coin\" for Johnson in a battle defined by Brexit.\n\n\"The threat to Boris Johnson and the Conservatives is that if he goes too far in one direction or the other on Brexit it alienates voters on the other side ... An election is such a gamble because there is no obvious way to please enough of the people enough of the time.\"\n\nLabour hopes for 2017 repeat\n\nLabour, lagging well behind the Tories in the polls, also has reason to be nervous about an election. Nevertheless, party officials remain confident that, as in 2017, a campaign focused on policy priorities other than Brexit would enable them to win votes by highlighting years of Conservative austerity, a redistribution of wealth from top earners, and promises of higher funding for public services.\n\n\"Ultimately it will be a choice between Boris and [senior adviser Dominic] Cummings with their elitism and total disregard for public services, which stands against everything Leave voters expressed, or Labour Party with a strong detailed manifesto,\" one Labour official said.\n\nJohnson's spending priorities \u2014 more money for police, schools, the NHS and social care \u2014 set out by Chancellor Sajid Javid in a spending round on Wednesday \u2014 is a very deliberate attempt to nix Labour's case.\n\nThe Conservative vote is also extremely vulnerable in Scotland. YouGov polling this week predicted Johnson could lose 10 of the party's 13 seats north of the border, with Nicola Sturgeon's Scottish National Party set to gain from concern about no deal in a country that voted 62 to 38 to Remain in 2016.\n\n\"There are certain areas of the country that are Remain-leaning. London, Scotland, large metropolitan cities, university towns ... If the Conservatives don\u2019t pick up enough of those seats it\u2019s really difficult to see where the majority comes from,\" Twyman said.\n\nCrucially Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats all back a second referendum on Brexit. If an election is held in October, by the new year the U.K. could be gearing up for such a vote.\n\nOr, if just a few key marginal seats go in a different direction, by then the U.K. could have left the EU, with or without a deal.\n\nFor Johnson and for the U.K., it is the ultimate roll of the dice.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
