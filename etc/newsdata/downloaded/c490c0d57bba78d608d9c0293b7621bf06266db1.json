I don\u2019t think it matters,\u201d billionaire environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer told Fox News when asked if not making the stage would set back his White House bid.\n\nDEMOCRATIC DEBATE LINEUP SLASHED IN HALF AS NUMEROUS CONTENDERS DON'T MAKE THE CUT\n\nSteyer, who was interviewed as he arrived in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire, vowed that \u201cwe\u2019ll keep going, doing exactly what I\u2019m doing here in New Hampshire. I will keep talking to people and getting my message out.\u201d\n\nThe philanthropist, who made his fortune as a hedge fund manager, declared his candidacy just two months ago. He jumped into the race too late to qualify for the second-round debates, which were held at the end of July.\n\nHe reached one of the two DNC thresholds to make the cut for the third and fourth round debates \u2013 campaign contributions from 130,000 unique donors. But he ended up one poll shy of reaching the other criteria \u2013 hitting at least 2 percent in four qualifying national or early voting state surveys.\n\nSTEYER: TRUMP'S THE 'MOST CORRUPT PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY'\n\nSteyer, who used millions of his own money to blanket the cable news networks and the airwaves in the early voting states with TV commercials this summer, highlighted that \u201cpeople are hearing my message and responding to it.\u201d\n\nAnd he blamed a dearth of qualifying polls for his failure to make next week\u2019s debate stage, emphasizing that \u201cthey just haven\u2019t run any polls in the early voting states.\u201d\n\nIn his interview, Steyer also jabbed at some of the other Democratic nomination contenders over one of his key issues \u2013 climate change.\n\n\u201cI will declare a climate emergency on day one of my presidency,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd pointing to his rivals who \u201chave plans that sound great,\u201d he said it\u2019s not enough unless they \u201care willing to say that.\u201d\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii ended up two polls short of qualifying for next week\u2019s debate. Unlike Steyer, the Hawaii national guard officer and Iraq War veteran was less diplomatic in her critique of the DNC.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that we\u2019ve seen really a lack of transparency in how the DNC is choosing which polls they would recognize as qualifiers,\u201d she told reporters after headlining the \"Politics and Eggs\" speaking series in New Hampshire Thursday morning.\n\nGABBARD SAYS SHE'LL KEEP GRAY STREAK IN HAIR TO HONOR FALLEN SOLDIERS\n\nLooking to next week\u2019s showdown, she acknowledged \u201cit would have been good to be there. It\u2019s a great platform to speak to millions of people in the country.\u201d\n\nShe called failing to make the cut \u201ca minor setback but it\u2019s not one that can\u2019t be overcome.\u201d\n\nGabbard was optimistic she\u2019d make the October primetime showdown, but added \u201cthe debate is not the only way to reach voters so really what I\u2019m focusing on is continuing to move forward, spending time with voters here in New Hampshire. We just left Iowa and continue to bring our message to people.\u201d\n\nFormer three-term Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, a long-shot who came nowhere close to qualifying for the debate, also blamed a lack of polling for failing to make the stage.\n\n\u201cThere weren\u2019t a lot of polls in August. That was part of the problem,\u201d he told Fox News on Wednesday.\n\nBut Delaney, a multi-millionaire who\u2019s mostly self-financing his campaign, also fell short of reaching the fundraising criteria. He called the donor threshold \u201ca ridiculous requirement.\n\nDelaney noted that the DNC\u2019s \u201cnever done anything like this before. I think in many ways the Republicans did it better last time, because they let everyone debate and they had two different stages. So if you were polling better, you were on the first stage and if you weren\u2019t polling as well you were on the second stage. At least that allowed everyone to be debating and I think that was a better approach than what the DNC is doing.\u201d\n\nDELANEY SUGGESTS SOME 2020 DEMOCRATS ARE 'CHEERING ON A RECESSION' TO HURT TRUMP\n\nHe admitted that \u201cit\u2019s always better to be in the debates.\u201d\n\nBut he downplayed the significance of the debates, saying \u201cI was in the first two debates. It\u2019s not clear that the debates changed anything for anyone.\u201d\n\nWith five months to go until Iowa and New Hampshire kick off the presidential nominating calendar, Delaney said, \u201cI do think it\u2019s early. When I travel around here in New Hampshire, my sense is that people are just starting to dial in.\u201d\n\nAnd he emphasized \u201cI\u2019m planning on staying in. Period.\u201d\n\nDelaney did set a deadline, stressing that, \u201cI have to do well in Iowa and I have to do well in New Hampshire. So that to me is the big deciding point in the campaign.\u201d", "description": "One week ahead of the Democrats' next presidential nomination debate in Houston, three of the lower-tier candidates who failed to make the stage are vowing to march on and taking aim at the Democratic National Committee over the qualifying criteria.", "authors": ["Paul Steinhauser", "Paul Steinhauser Is A Politics Reporter Based In New Hampshire."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/TulsiGabbard-NHIOP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
