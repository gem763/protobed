(AP Photo/Matt Slocum)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Latest on Game 5 of the World Series (all times local):\n\n10:11 p.m.\n\nGerrit Cole has retired eight straight batters for the Astros, who are nine outs away from taking a 3-2 lead in the World Series over the Nationals.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHouston leads Washington 4-0 after six innings. The Astros lost Games 1 and 2 at home before rebounding to take the next two at Nationals Park.\n\nThe last time the World Series began with five consecutive road wins was 1996, when the New York Yankees ended the trend in Game 6 to finish off the Atlanta Braves.\n\nCole has thrown 84 pitches, allowing two hits and striking out seven.\n\n---\n\n9:52 p.m.\n\nGerrit Cole is cruising through five innings for the Astros as they seek to return to Houston with a 3-2 World Series lead over the Washington Nationals.\n\nCole, a leading candidate for the AL Cy Young Award, has allowed two hits and one walk through five innings, striking out five. The Astros lead 4-0.\n\nNationals starter Joe Ross allowed four runs on five hits in five innings. All the damage came on two-run homers by Yordan Alvarez and Carlos Correa. He was replaced by Tanner Rainey in the sixth.\n\n---\n\n9:36 p.m.\n\nCarlos Correa hit a two-run homer in the fourth inning to give the Houston Astros a 4-0 lead over the Washington Nationals in Game 5.\n\nJoe Ross hung a 2-2 slider and Correa connected for a no-doubt shot to the seats in left field, quieting a crowd that had been chanting in support of the surprise starting pitcher. Ross took the mound after Max Scherzer was scratched with a neck injury.\n\nRoss has allowed four runs on five hits through four innings.\n\nGerrit Cole has had little trouble with a Nationals lineup that beat him in Game 1, part of Washington's run of eight straight playoff wins. He has allowed two hits in four innings.\n\n---\n\n9:09 p.m.\n\nStory continues\n\nPresident Donald Trump was met with loud, sustained boos and chants of ''Lock him up!'' from fans at Nationals Park when he was shown on the in-stadium video screen after the third inning of Game 5.\n\nThe boos ended only after the video screen cut to a shot of U.S. service members waving to the crowd and then showed a message thanking the military. Trump is attending the game with five wounded veterans.\n\nThen, as Nationals starter Joe Ross took the mound to warm up for the fourth inning, fans started chanting, ''Lock him up!'' in an apparent reference to ongoing impeachment proceedings against the president. Pro-Trump crowds have frequently chanted ''Lock her up!'' about Hillary Clinton at the president's campaign rallies.\n\nTrump was attending his first major league game since he took office in January 2017. He did not throw out the ceremonial first pitch and arrived with no fanfare just as the game began.\n\nTrump, who campaigned on a promise to ''drain the swamp,'' is deeply unpopular in the Washington area. He received 4% of the vote in the District of Columbia and lost both Maryland and Virginia in 2016.\n\n---\n\n8:49 p.m.\n\nRookie slugger Yordan Alvarez helped the Astros jump on the Washington Nationals again, lining a two-run homer into the first row of seats in right-center to give Houston a 2-0 lead after two innings of Game 5.\n\nThe Astros lost the first two games of the World Series at home but are looking to return to Houston up 3-2. Houston also got early 2-0 leads in Games 3 and 4.\n\nAlvarez played left field, his first start since Game 2. He was the designated hitter in the AL park. He hit 27 homers in 87 regular season games but had not gone deep in his previous 71 at-bats dating to Sept. 21.\n\nAt 22 years, 122 days, he became the youngest Cuban-born player to homer in the World Series.\n\nJuan Soto and Howie Kendrick singled to open the bottom of the second for Washington, but Gerrit Cole struck out Ryan Zimmerman and got a double-play grounder from Victor Robles.\n\n---\n\n8:28 p.m.\n\nNationals fans looking for something to cheer for are rallying around spot starter Joe Ross, who took the mound for Game 5 after Max Scherzer was scratched with a neck injury.\n\nRoss walked leadoff batter George Springer but got red-hot Jose Altuve to bounce into a double play on the first pitch. He retired Michael Brantley on a grounder into the shift in right field to end his first inning.\n\nFans chanted ''Let's go Joe!'' to support Ross, who has only pitched once in the playoffs, a two-inning relief stint in Friday night's loss.\n\nThe Nationals are the first team since the 1980 Philadelphia Phillies to use five starting pitchers in the World Series.\n\nAstros starter Gerrit Cole retired the Nationals in order in the first.\n\n---\n\n8:17 p.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is attending his first major league game as president, arriving Sunday night at Nationals Park just before the first pitch of Game 5 of the World Series.\n\nThe Washington Nationals and Houston Astros are tied at two games apiece.\n\nTrump emerged from his motorcade wearing a dark suit and tie. He took a seat in a lower-tier box to the left of home plate.\ufffdFive wounded veterans are among those watching the game with the president.\n\nTrump's entourage includes Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Congressman Kevin Brady of Texas.\n\nThe president's arrival was not shown on in-stadium video monitors, but fans near the president turned and took pictures of him.\n\n---\n\n7:55 p.m.\n\nWashington-based celebrity chef Jose Andres got a big cheer when he lobbed the ceremonial first pitch ahead of Game 5 of the World Series at Nationals Park.\n\nAndres is a vocal critic of President Donald Trump's immigration policies and his administration's response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. He was chosen by the team to toss the first ball. Andres, a native of Spain, pumped his fist after the ball barely crossed home plate on the fly.\n\nTrump is attending Game 5, the first time he has been to Nationals Park since he took office. He planned to arrive after the game began to minimize disruption to fans trying to enter the stadium. The stands were full of red towel-waving fans before the first pitch despite enhanced security at entrance gates that included explosive-sniffing dogs, Secret Service officers and Transportation Security Agency employees.\n\nSgt. Major Bob McDonald of the U.S. Army Chorus sang the national anthem.\n\n---\n\n6:20 p.m.\n\nMax Scherzer says he can't lift his right arm and needed help from his wife to get dressed because of a muscle spasm and pinched nerve in his neck.\n\nScherzer was scratched as the Washington Nationals' starting pitcher for Game 5 of the World Series against the Houston Astros. Joe Ross will take his place.\n\nScherzer says his neck spasms started over the last few days and he got treatment in an effort to be ready to pitch. But he says he woke up Sunday morning and couldn't get out of bed. He had to fall out of bed and push himself up with his left arm.\n\nThe three-time Cy Young Award winner had a cortisone shot in hopes of being ready for a possible Game 7.\n\nScherzer says he texted Ross to let him know he would be starting.\n\n''I'm as disappointed as I possibly can be not to be able to pitch tonight. It's Game 5 of the World Series,'' Scherzer said. ''I've pitched through so much crap in my career that that would be easy to pitch through at this point. This is literally impossible to do anything with.''\n\n---\n\n5:36 p.m.\n\nRookie Yordan Alvarez was back in the Astros' starting lineup for Game 5 of the World Series against the Washington Nationals.\n\nAlvarez, who hit 27 homers in 87 regular season games, was batting sixth and playing left field. He was the designated hitter in Games 1 and 2 but was benched as the series moved to the NL ballpark.\n\nCatcher Robinson Chirinos, who homered in Games 3 and 4, was benched for the Astros. Martin Maldonado was behind the plate with Gerrit Cole pitching in a repeat of the Game 1 battery.\n\nWith scheduled starter Max Scherzer scratched for Washington with spasms near his neck, his preferred catcher Kurt Suzuki was on the bench for the second straight night. Suzuki has a right hip flexor injury, but manager Dave Martinez said he would be available for Game 6. Yan Gomes started at catcher.\n\nShortstop Trea Turner led off for Washington, followed by right fielder Adam Eaton, third baseman Anthony Rendon, left fielder Juan Soto, second baseman Howie Kendrick, first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, left fielder Victor Robles, Gomes and pitcher Joe Ross.\n\nFor Houston, George Springer led off and played center field, followed by second baseman Jose Altuve, right fielder Michael Brantley, third baseman Alex Bregman, first baseman Yuli Gurriel, Alvarez, shortstop Carlos Correa, Maldonado and Cole.\n\n---\n\n5:25 p.m.\n\nWashington pitcher Stephen Strasburg could tell it was a big game by the pooches.\n\nPresident Donald Trump was set to attend Game 5 of the World Series at Nationals Park. As part of protocol, the clubhouses were swept as a precaution.\n\n''I think everybody is excited. It's the president of the United States,'' Strasburg said.\n\n''So there's obviously beefed up security,'' he said. ''So usually the dogs that are sniffing in our clubhouse are these nice Labs that are super friendly. And today there was a German shepherd that I didn't really feel comfortable petting.''\n\n---\n\n4:45 p.m.\n\nNationals pitcher Max Scherzer was scratched from his scheduled start in Game 5 of the World Series because of spasms near his neck.\n\nWashington manager Dave Martinez made the announcement 3+ hours before the first pitch Sunday night.\n\nJoe Ross was scheduled to start in place of Scherzer. Gerrit Cole starts for Houston, with the Series tied 2-2.\n\nMartinez said Scherzer felt the spasm near his neck and trapezius muscle on his right side Saturday and woke up Sunday and texted the team trainer that ''he was really hurting.''\n\nMartinez said Scherzer was ''locked up'' and ''he was in a bad place.''\n\n''He's very upset,'' Martinez said.\n\n---\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports", "description": "Gerrit Cole has retired eight straight batters for the Astros, who are nine outs away from taking a 3-2 lead in the World Series over the Nationals.
