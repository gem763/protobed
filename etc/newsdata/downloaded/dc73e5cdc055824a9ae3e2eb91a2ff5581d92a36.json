Then Her Comment Was Deleted", "language": "en", "text": "From ELLE\n\nHailey Baldwin posted an Instagram of herself listening to Summer Walker's 'I'll Kill You,' minutes after Selena Gomez's new breakup song\u2014believed to be about Gomez's ex and Baldwin's husband Justin Bieber\u2014came out. She woke up this morning to a lot of upset Selena Gomez fans convinced the post was about Gomez and news outlets covering the controversy.\n\nBaldwin addressed the rumour head-on, commenting on JustJared's Instagram about what she meant by the Instagram Story. The comment was deleted just as it started to blow up, but a screenshot was taken by the outlet and remains on its site.\n\nJustJared wrote in its caption initially: 'Fans think Hailey Bieber posted quite the pointed response to Selena Gomez after the release of Selena\u2019s song 'Lose You To Love Me,'' then teased their story.\n\nBaldwin responded in the comments, 'please stop with this nonsense. There is no 'response.' This is complete BS.' So there it is: Baldwin wasn't throwing shade, everyone.\n\nBaldwin has actually been quietly supportive of Gomez the past couple weeks. The model liked two Instagrams with Selena Gomez in it alongside her friends: one Raquelle Stevens posted from the Giving Back Generation episode Gomez shot with Stevens, Ashley Cook, and Courtney Lopez; and another that Lopez posted of Gomez posing with a group of friends at dinner. That photo sparked a very brief Niall Horan-Selena Gomez dating rumor before his arm was wrapped around her, and the two were subject to romance rumors before. In reality, they're friends, a source clarified to E!.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "No drama intended?", "authors": ["Alyssa Bailey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jslsMpc_sYqOB58C7z8Qkw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_865/34014a4c95bfbae5d1336d4608d3f55d", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
