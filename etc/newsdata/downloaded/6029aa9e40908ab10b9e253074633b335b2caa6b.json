That's all I can explain for the chest.\"\n\nBut when asked about the other injuries on her tiny body he said: \"I don't know, I can't tell you.\"\n\nEarlier in today's proceedings the court heard extracts from the same interview in which Eves' spoke about waking up to find his daughter unconscious in her a moses basket beside the couple's bed.\n\nCherinea was said to be asleep on the sofa on the ground floor of the pair's council house.\n\n(Image: Central News)\n\nA neighbour claims to have seen her drive away from the home at 2am.\n\nEves said: \"I looked over and I saw her in the cot and she was purple.\n\n\"I picked her up and quickly grabbed hold of her. I shouted to Cherinea and ran down the stairs.\n\n\"I'm saying she's not breathing and that's when we started resuscitating her. I had to stick my fingers down her throat to make sure her airways were clear.\n\n\"I blowed down her throat and started pumping her with my hands.\n\n\"Cherinea said I was doing it wrong. She was pushing with three fingers or something and doing it a lot lighter - she was doing so many pumps and pushing down on her.\"\n\nEves, of Wixams, Bedfordshire, denies murder and grievous bodily harm with intent.\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Kevin Eves is standing trial at the Old Bailey in London after Harper Denton was found dead at her family home in Bedfordshire", "authors": ["William Janes", "Milo Boyd", "Image", "Pa Archive Pa Images", "Central News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20634111.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_London-courts-stock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
