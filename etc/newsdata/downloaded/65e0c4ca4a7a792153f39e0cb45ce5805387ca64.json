She is seen in the above image during her service in the Israeli military\n\nShe was returning home after spending three months in India, her sister, Liad Gold, told Fox News.\n\nIsraeli officials say that Issachar was caught up in a political dispute that encompasses Russia, Israel, and the U.S.\n\nThe Russians are angry with Israel after its Supreme Court gave the green light to extradite Alexei Borkov to America.\n\nBorkov, a Russian national from St. Petersburg, was arrested by Israeli authorities in 2015 who were acting on an Interpol red notice.\n\nThe alleged hacker was vacationing in Israel at the time of his arrest.\n\nBorkov was wanted by the U.S. for allegedly hacking credit card databases of American citizens and then sharing those credit card details with other hackers.\n\nShortly following his arrest, the Israeli government approved an order to extradite him to the U.S.\n\nUnder Israeli law, any extradition is subject to approval by the courts.\n\nThe Russian government repeatedly demanded that Israel release Borkov, but the Israeli government said its hands were tied because it could not intervene with a legal matter that needed to be decided in the courts.\n\nAfter Issachar\u2019s arrest in April, the Russian authorities charged her with possession as well as attempting to smuggle drugs into the country.\n\nIn the months following the arrest, the Russian government offered to release Issachar in exchange for an Israeli pledge to free Borkov.\n\nIsraeli officials say Russia has offered to release Issachar in exchange for Israel agreeing to free Alexei Borkov (above), an alleged hacker who is being extradited to the United States. Borkov was arrested while vacationing in Israel in 2015\n\nBut the Israeli government rejected the proposal, saying that it legally could not agree to it.\n\nIsrael also would not be able to refuse an American request for extradition.\n\nIn August, Israel\u2019s Supreme Court approved Borkov\u2019s extradition to the U.S., according to Axios.\n\nTwo weeks later, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi.\n\nAt the meeting, Netanyahu expressed Israel\u2019s view that the sentence handed down against Issachar was disproportionate.\n\nThe Israeli leader told Putin that even if he wanted to free Borkov, he could not do so in violation of a Supreme Court order.\n\nEarlier this week, Netanyahu and Putin once again discussed the matter by telephone, but the two sides made no progress.\n\nIsrael's president has asked Putin to pardon Issachar.\n\nIn a letter to Putin on Sunday, President Reuven Rivlin called the Russian sentence 'severe' and said it would have a 'deeply destructive impact on her life.'\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has raised the issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but no progress has been made. Netanyahu (left) and Putin (right) are seen above on September 12 in Sochi\n\nAfter the Moscow court sentenced Issachar on Friday, the Israeli Foreign Ministry released a statement which read: \u2018Israel gravely views the verdict given today in Russia concerning Israeli citizen Naama Issachar.\n\n\u2018This is a substantial and disproportionate punishment for a young Israeli with no criminal record, who arrived in Moscow with the intention of catching a connecting flight on her way home to Israel.\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, Russian authorities have not as yet heeded our requests to conduct the case appropriately in accordance to the circumstances of her arrest.\u2019\n\nIssachar, a native of Fair Lawn, New Jersey, immigrated to Israel at the age of 16.\n\nHer sister, Gold, told Fox News that her mother has been in Russia since April, when Issachar was arrested.\n\nNetanyahu phoned their mother on Friday and pledged to do all he could to secure her release.\n\n\u2018I feel incredibly terrible and sad and heartbroken for her,\u2019 Gold told Fox News.\n\n\u2018She is very strong but she won\u2019t survive there much longer.\u2019\n\nGold told Fox News that her sister accidentally left some cannabis in her luggage, which was then discovered by Russian customs officials at the Moscow airport.\n\nAn audio of Issachar\u2019s court hearing aired on Israeli television.\n\nShe is heard telling the judge: \u2018I am aware that I acted irresponsibly before my flight, that I should have been aware of all of the items I have on my person.\n\n\u2018That is the reason that I took full responsibility for Charge 228 (possession) in my first trial in April.\u2019", "description": "Naama Issachar, 25, was sentenced by a Moscow court on Friday.
