The main thing overlooking me is Tans.\"\n\nSimon Cowell thanked Vinnie for taking part and for turning the lacklustre live show around as the crowd chanted his name.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nThe judge said: \"You know what Vinnie, I would say after that there is a shot you could actually win this competition. That was so much fun.\n\n\"I have so much respect for you as a man and everything you've been through, I know it's been tough. I cannot thank you enough. I thought you brought the show to life in this moment when we needed it.\n\n\"I know you\u2019re a hard man but you\u2019ve got a soft inside. A great heart. Snd really played to your strengths.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nX Factor viewers flocked to Twitter after watching Vinnie's sensational performance.\n\nOne viewer said: \"Vinnie Jones has just single handily saved Celebrity X Factor. A celebrity is someone who people want to celebrate... that\u2019s exactly what he is.\"\n\n\"Vinnie Jones is just class really isn\u2019t he,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"Gotta love Vinnie, he dared to dream when he was young & then lived the dream through hard work & determination.\"\n\n\"Vinnie Jones has just become my new favourite person ever,\" said a fourth.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nVinnie admitted things may get emotional later on in the series as he will sing some of wife Tanya\u2019s favourite songs as a tribute.\n\nHe told the Mirror: \"There\u2019s one song that I like, which I might be singing. It\u2019s one that means a lot to us. I can see her now looking out the window of the car tapping along to it. There are a lot of songs that mean a lot to us.\n\n\"I\u2019m not treating it like a singing competition, I\u2019m doing it as a tribute for Tanya.\"\n\nIt is understood he has been rehearsing Everybody Needs Somebody To Love for the opening show, but may perform more tearjerking tracks later in the series.\n\nVinnie has vowed to give any X Factor winnings to the hospitals that cared for his late wife, Harefield hospital and Cedars Sinai.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019ve got a song that I could get emotional to, but Tanya wouldn\u2019t want me to crack up. It\u2019s a ballad, an Irish song, it\u2019s basically about me and her. So it\u2019s a sad song.\n\n\"If I can get through that, I think that could bring the house down.\n\n\"The biggest part of doing X Factor was Tanya. She loved the show, she thought it would be brilliant. I\u2019m like, \u2018No no, really?\u2019 She was like \u2018yeah you\u2019ll be brilliant, I love it,\u2019 then my daughter jumped in, Kaley, and she\u2019s like you\u2019ve got to do it.\n\n\"It gave Tanya something to look forward to, to come over to London and get well for.\n\n\"Sadly it was a bridge too far for her.\"\n\n*The X Factor: Celebrity airs Saturday on ITV at 8.20pm", "description": "The former footballer inspired X Factor: Celebrity viewers with his uplifting performance in tribute to Tanya", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv", "Getty", "Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20733325.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-X-Factor-Vinnie-Jones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
