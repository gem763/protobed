He was 85.\n\nLeonov flew on the crewed spacecraft Voskhod 2 with copilot Pavel Belyayev in March 1965; during that mission, he left the ship and spent just over 12 minutes in space, becoming the first astronaut to do so.\n\nAs we previously reported, the spacewalk was a harrowing affair. Leonov\u2019s body temperature spiked, and his spacesuit had inflated so much that he couldn\u2019t control it. He attempted to deflate it, but the quick depressurization nearly gave him the bends. He needed to re-enter the spacecraft the wrong way.\n\nThe re-entry didn\u2019t go so well either; they needed to manually control the spacecraft, sent themselves far off course, and ended up in a deserted forest surrounded by aggressive wolves and bears. After the rescuers arrived, the two cosmonauts still needed to ski to safety. Still, Leonov had achieved a world first, the first time a human had walked in outer space.\n\nThe space race continued onward, the Americans eventually repeating the Russian feat and putting astronauts on the moon in 1969. Leonov himself didn\u2019t fly to space again until 1975 for another important space milestone: the 1975 joint Apollo-Soyuz mission, the first time the United States and Soviet Union ran a joint mission.\n\nLeonov was the last surviving member of the two crewed Voskhod launches.", "description": "Alexei Leonov, the first person to walk in space, passed away this week.", "authors": ["Sam Rutherford", "Beth Elderkin"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/voteg00rnnpwmba8kqwv.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
