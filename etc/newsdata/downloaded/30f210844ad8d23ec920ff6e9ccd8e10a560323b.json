The city's official account later posted a video of the removal.\n\nThe Port Authority of Allegheny County says the driver and a 56-year-old female passenger were aboard when the bus plunged into the hole Monday morning. Officials say the passenger was treated at a hospital and released.\n\nPublic Safety Director Wendell Hissrich says the bus was sitting on three power lines, two of them 22,000-volt lines. He said there are also fiberoptic cables, and damage to them could affect communications in the tri-state area.\n\nThe lines and pipes will be assessed and repaired.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
