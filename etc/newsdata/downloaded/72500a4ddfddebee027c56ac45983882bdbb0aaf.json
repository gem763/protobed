The protesters banged pots and pans, blew plastic whistles and waved the Chilean and Mapuche indigenous flags. Vendors sold snacks, jewelry, hats and t-shirts. The demonstrators, many in their 20s and 30s, pressed their call for changes to a market-dominant socio-economic model that has fully or partially privatized pensions, health and education. They hoisted signs calling for pension reform, an end to the private ownership of water rights or for the resignation of President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an economic development system that\u2019s made us all accustomed to injustice, a profound dissatisfaction among the vast majority of people who feel that they aren\u2019t seeing the benefits of economic development,\u201d said Jorge Pinto, a 24-year-old student of public administration.\n\nOn several side streets the atmosphere was tenser, as groups of masked protesters set fire to garbage and trees in a local park, before they were chased off by police with tear gas and water cannon. Attempts to march to La Moneda, the presidential palace, were frustrated by police barricades.\n\nSome demonstrators are angry about the retirement system, which forces Chileans to hand over 10 percent of their income to private fund managers and then receive pensions that barely cover a third of most people\u2019s monthly expenses. Others fume about a public health system that makes many wait months for an appointment with a specialist, or seek expensive private care.\n\nStill others resent university loans that they are still paying into their 40s and 50s, even as 1% of the population earns 33 percent of the nation\u2019s wealth, making Chile the most unequal country in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development group of wealthy nations.\n\nVirtually none have been satisfied by Pi\u00f1era\u2019s response to the protests, which includes replacing eight ministers, calling for national dialogue, offering small increases in the minimum wage and the lowest pensions, higher taxes on the wealthy and decreases in the prices of medicine and electricity.\n\nPi\u00f1era, a billionaire businessman who sees the private sector and economic growth as the keys to national success, may be hoping that his relatively minor concessions will calm the streets as protests approach the two-week mark, said Lucia Dammert, a sociologist and political scientist at the University of Santiago.\n\nIt remains uncertain if that will happen, Dammert said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really unclear what the government\u2019s strategy is. They find themselves facing a situation they weren\u2019t prepared for,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a government with an intense focus on economic growth. \u2026 They may be thinking that the streets will quiet down as time passes and people get exhausted.\u201d\n\nPi\u00f1era\u2019s approval is at 14 percent, according to recent polls, but protests have focused mostly on replacing the constitution, saying its focus on prioritizing private control of virtually every aspect of the economy is the root of the country\u2019s problems, regardless of who\u2019s in power.\n\n\u201cHis proposals are a joke; they\u2019re not really the solutions that the people want,\u201d said Lindsay Silva, a 24-year-old student working on a degree in physical therapy and health at the University of Santiago. \u201cInequality affects me every day because my family can\u2019t pay its bills and has to make big sacrifices in order for me to have opportunities.\u201d\n\nMany protesters want a new constitution to replace the one that was written in 1980 under military dictator Augusto Pinochet and that creates the legal basis of Chile\u2019s market-driven system. That idea began to gain momentum Tuesday when the leader of one of the three parties that supports Pi\u00f1era in congress came out in favor of reforming the constitution.\n\n\u201cThe idea of changing the constitution, of eventually creating a new constitution, is getting ever stronger, and that\u2019s legitimate and must be discussed,\u201d said Congressman Mario Desborde, president of the National Renovation party. \u201cIf the constitution must be changed, it must be changed. \u2026 I don\u2019t fear democracy in the slightest.\u201d\n\nSix opposition parties control the House and Senate and favor changing the constitution but don\u2019t have enough votes between them to do that, making support from governing parties essential.\n\nThe opposition parties were holding meetings Tuesday to begin moving forward on constitutional reform.\n\nFrom afar, Chile has been a regional success story: Under democratically elected presidents on the left and right, a free-market consensus has driven growth up, poverty down and won Chile the region\u2019s highest score on the United Nations Human Development Index, a blend of life expectancy, education and national income per capita.\n\nIn 2010, Chile became the second Latin nation in the OECD, after Mexico. Next month, Pi\u00f1era will host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, followed by the 25th United Nations Climate Change Conference in December.\n\nPi\u00f1era\u2019s proposals to calm the protests so far \u201care window dressing, because none of the things we\u2019ve been fighting for has really been achieved,\u201d said Catalina Alfaro, 55, who hasn\u2019t been able to join the protests because she has been busy running a bakery she owns in western Santiago.\n\n\u201cThings in Chile could calm down if he says to our faces that we\u2019re going to change the constitution.\u201d\n\nSocial Development Minister said Sebasti\u00e1n Sichel said the government was asking municipalities to begin calling citizen forums as part of a national dialogue to develop concrete proposals for change out of the national protests.\n\nHe said that if citizens wanted a constitutional assembly, specially called to produce a new national charter, the government could support it.\n\n\u201cThis can go where the citizens want it to,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no barriers.\u201d\n\n_______\n\nAssociated Press journalist Marcos Sepulveda Loyola contributed to this report.", "description": "SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) \u2014 Thousands of Chileans filled a plaza in the center of the capital Tuesday in the 12th day of demonstrations that began with youth", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/29/a08285_chile-protests-08347-anti-government-protesters-set-up-barricade-in-santiago-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
