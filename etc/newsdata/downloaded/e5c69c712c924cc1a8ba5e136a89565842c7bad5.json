Although such a view of Moscow has seemingly been prevalent both in Europe and across the pond ever since crisis broke out in Ukraine in 2014, it is high time this approach was reviewed, the politician believes.\n\nToday, Russia is a genuine global power broker.\n\nThe former official noted that Moscow\u2019s years-long diplomatic efforts appear to have finally paid off now as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced Kiev\u2019s support for an agreement on elections in the breakaway eastern regions, aimed at eventually granting them special status \u2013 something that Russia has advocated all along. Similarly, in September, the UN finalized formation of a 150-member constitutional committee for Syria \u2013 a body first proposed at the Russia-hosted conference in 2018.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018End of Western hegemony\u2019: Why does Macron want Russia at Europe\u2019s side?\n\nMoscow\u2019s latest response to the attack on the Saudi oil facilities also presents it as a \u201cpotential underwriter of regional stability,\u201d Palacio believes, hailing Russia for its intention to work with all the parties in the region amid heightened tensions between Riyadh and Tehran.\n\nThis is the approach of a strategist, not a spoiler.\n\nIt is the gun-toting policies of Washington that are instead shifting it to the role of a threat to global stability, Palacio warns. In her guest piece for Project Syndicate, she says that perception of America as a \u201cprimary status quo power\u201d is nothing but a \u201cforce of habit\u201d as the US has lately shown \u201cno inclination to lead.\u201d\n\nPalacio slammed President Donald Trump\u2019s decisions to withdraw from the landmark 2015 Iranian nuclear deal and 2016 Paris climate agreement by saying that they are \u201csometimes tantamount to behaving like a spoiler.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Sergey Lavrov: \u2018World at a crossroads and a system of international relations for the future\u2019\n\nShe was much more cautious in her assessment of Europe\u2019s role in the international relations, though. Without criticizing it, the Spanish politician still ascribes the Old Continent a role not of an independent leading force but rather a \u201csystemic facilitator.\u201d\n\nIn this regard, Spain\u2019s former top diplomat urges the European leaders to once again review their approaches \u201cto consider all the potential consequences of the agreements they facilitate within a shifting global order\u201d and \u201cto know exactly whom [their] efforts serve.\u201d\n\nLike this story?
