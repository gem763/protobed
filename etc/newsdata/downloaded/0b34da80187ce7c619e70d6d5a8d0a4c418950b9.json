He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY. Such lies about him. They want to scare him into turning Liberal! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\nBrett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can\u2019t let that happen! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\nTrump believes these accusations are being brought forward because of Kavanaugh's conservative opinions and the mainstream media's desire to protect leftist policies. And he's onto something. Remember, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's attorney, Debra Katz, admitted Ford came forward with her allegations because of Kavanaugh's \"attack\" on Roe v. Wade.\n\nIf Ramirez's story was credible then why did it take the Times almost a year to corroborate her story? If the new accuser, Max Steiner, was so willing to talk about what he saw, why didn't he go to news outlets, especially liberal mainstream media rags like the Times or WaPo, when the accusations first came out? Or even during the confirmation process? The timeline should tell you something.", "description": ".09/15/2019 19:06:33PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/233/f29f3628-a9b9-41e1-972e-0df2c6d426ac.png", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
