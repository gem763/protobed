Hackers were able to acccess millions of Facebook accounts after stealing \"access tokens\" used to log in users connecting via third-party apps and services.\n\nUsers would sign in to the site via these services using their Facebook login details, meaning that gaining control of the access tokens would give attackers entry to full accounts.\n\n\u201cFacebook knew about the access token vulnerability and failed to fix it for years, despite that knowledge,\u201d the court filing at the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco read.\n\n\u201cEven more egregiously, Facebook took steps to protect its own employees from the security risk, but not the vast majority of its users.\u201d\n\nOf those affected in the attack, around 14 million saw profile details such as birth dates, employers, education history, religious preference, types of devices used, pages followed and recent searches and location check-ins stolen.\n\nNames and contact details were exposed for the other 15 million users, with around 400,000 others having their posts and lists of friends and groups open.\n\nFacebook has yet to respond to the filing, but faces yet more questioning over its security protection systems.\n\nThe company Facebook was fined a record $5bn by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) last month to settle privacy concerns over the Cambridge Analytica data-stealing scandal.\n\nThe best VPN service of 2019\n\nVia Reuters", "description": "Facebook did not alert users to known vulnerabilities before 2018 breach, lawsuit claims.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5fLkc9emDshZF9hFhXpu9S-1200-80.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-16"}
