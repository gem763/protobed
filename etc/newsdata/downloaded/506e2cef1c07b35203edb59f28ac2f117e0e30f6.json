He also wanted to move the Romanian embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in a move meant to mirror Trump's, which would break with EU policy.\n\nLast year, as the U.S. embassy in Romania condemned moves by the governing party to change judicial laws \u2013 supported by Dragnea \u2014 that were seen as weakening the fight against corruption, Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani sent a letter to Romania's president taking Dragnea's side in the debate. Giuliani told POLITICO at the time that he was paid to do it.\n\nDragnea's two children were also barred from entering the U.S. as a result of their father's involvement in corruption, the State Department said.", "description": "Liviu Dragnea was imprisoned in May over a corruption case.", "authors": ["Carmen Paun"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-629159100-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
