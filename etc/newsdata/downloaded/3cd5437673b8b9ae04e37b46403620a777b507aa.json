There were also 40 reported outbreaks of looting, while Governor of Santiago Karla Rubilar confirmed that 11 people had died as a result of the violence.\n\nThe demonstrations broke out early last week as a student revolt against a three percent increase in metro fares, with participants storming metro stations as part of a fare-dodging movement. On Friday, the situation escalated after protesters torched at least a dozen stations, causing an estimated $300m (\u00a3230m) of damage.\n\nChile declared a state of emergency after protests over a tax on subways grew to include anger over living costs and inequality. Security forces fired tear gas and arrested 1,400+ people. At least 11 people have died, and schools and shops are closed. pic.twitter.com/GVXigtBC1u \u2014 AJ+ (@ajplus) October 21, 2019\n\nOn Sunday evening, Chile\u2019s center-right President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era confirmed that he had scrapped plans to raise the cost of subway fairs but criticized the violent demonstrations, declaring that the country was at \u201cwar with a powerful and uncompromising enemy that respects nothing and no one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have listened humbly to the voice of the people and I will not be afraid to continue doing so, because that is how democracies are built,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cI have decided to suspend the rise of the subway, which will require the rapid approval of a law until we agree on a system that best protects our countrymen.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone has the right to demonstrate peacefully and solidarity with reasons they have to do so,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut no one can threaten the safety of any compatriot. Only together will we be able to protect and preserve our democracy. Let\u2019s take care of our families and take care of our country.\u201d\n\nThe unrest is the worst the country has faced since the final weeks of Augusto Pinochet\u2019s military junta, indicating a deep-rooted resentment over economic inequality, despite Chile being known as the most prosperous and stable country in Latin America.\n\n\u201cSomething deep is happening in Chile,\u201d political analyst Marta Lagos told the Financial Times. \u201cA huge portion of Chile\u2019s population felt left behind. This is not just a bunch of violent kids, it\u2019s much more than that. This is just the tip of the iceberg. That produces a very volatile situation that everyone was ignoring.\u201d\n\nThe protests come after less than two weeks after similar demonstrations broke out in the Ecuadorian capital of Quito and its largest city Guayaquil after President Len\u00edn Moreno announced an end to a decades-old gasoline subsidy introduced under Rafael Correa\u2019s former socialist administrations.\n\nAs part of the pushback, leftist groups began burning roadblocks and looting businesses throughout the country to pressure the government into scrapping the policy, which they eventually did.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "At least 11 people died while a state of emergency has been declared across parts of Chile following huge anti-government demonstrations.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1177480157-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
