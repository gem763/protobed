Tasmania and South Australia have both had one Oz Lotto division one win.\n\nAll but two of the Oz Lotto division one winning entries so far this year have been QuickPick entries where the numbers were randomly generated.\n\nThe Oz Lotto jackpot was last won in August by an Adelaide man who won $10 million, who said at the time it was 'weird' to learn he had become a millionaire.\n\nIt comes after three winners shared the massive $150 million Powerball jackpot which went off last month.\n\nThe prize jackpotted from $100million after no winners claimed the first division prize in the previous draw.\n\nLottery officials said around half of all adult Australians entered the Powerball draw, which eclipses the previous record prize of $107.6 million which went off in January.\n\nThe next Oz Lotto draw is next Tuesday night.", "description": "Thousands of hopeful Australians are checking their Oz Lotto tickets after the winning numbers were revealed.
