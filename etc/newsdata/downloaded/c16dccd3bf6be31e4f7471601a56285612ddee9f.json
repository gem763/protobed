The loss-making Canadian-listed palm oil company and its subsidiary, Plantations et Huileries du Congo (PHC), also receives support from other European development banks.\n\nThe CDC inquiry will examine Feronia\u2019s management of security teams as well as the immediate circumstances of Lunea\u2019s death. It follows an outcry over the failure of local police to arrest the suspect immediately.\n\nThe bank, which has invested $51.9m (\u00a342m) in Feronia since 2013, will report on the investigation\u2019s findings within a few weeks, according to the organisation\u2019s website.\n\nCDC said in a statement: \u201cImmediately following the tragic death of Mr Jo\u00ebl Imbangola Lunea, and separate to any police investigation, CDC appointed independent investigators to examine whether the incident was in any way connected to the alleged perpetrator\u2019s employment at Feronia.\n\n\u201cWhile the incident took place 18km away from Feronia\u2019s property when the employee was on holiday, it was entirely the responsible course of action to appoint independent investigators to examine the company\u2019s management of its security personnel and specifically, the individual alleged to have killed Mr Lunea. It would be inappropriate to comment further until the investigation is concluded.\u201d\n\nCDC has allocated nearly $10m of its investment in Feronia to improve healthcare, education and infrastructure.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jo\u00ebl Imbangola Lunea, left, worked for Congolese rights organisation R\u00e9seau d\u2019Information et d\u2019Appui aux ONG nationales. Photograph: Courtesy of RIAO-RDC\n\nLunea, a riverboat skipper, was a member of RIAO-RDC, a Congolese land rights NGO involved in a dispute with Feronia and PHC that dates back to 1911, when the land was granted to British Lord Leverhulme by the Belgian colonial authorities. RIAO-RDC claims ancestral land and forests for three palm-oil plantations operated by PHC were \u201cillegally stolen\u201d from communities and have left them unable to adequately feed and house their families.\n\nLunea was ferrying passengers on his pirogue near the northern Congolese village of Bempumba when the alleged attack took place.\n\nA relative of Lunea, who spoke to the Guardian but did not want to be named, said: \u201cWe have lost the head of our family. We have lost everything. We have nothing, no money, no means to pay for lawyers to investigate. Police are doing nothing. We are scared.\u201d\n\nThe family member said local staff at Feronia claimed the suspect, who is now in custody, did not work for the company. However, in a statement on its website in July, the company acknowledged one of its employees was being sought by police for Lunea\u2019s murder.\n\nIn 2017, British MPs from the international development committee expressed concern over CDC\u2019s investment in Feronia, following Reuters reports that the company had failed to meet a promise to improve housing for its Congelese staff, some of whom were paid less than the minimum wage. They recommended CDC publish a \u201cfull account of its investment in Feronia, addressing concerns about wages, conditions and land disputes\u201d.\n\nIn response, CDC said it was \u201cworking hard\u201d to increase wages from 2017. Feronia provides schools and hospitals and other infrastructure for workers and communities, it said, \u201cwithout the involvement of development finance institutions in Feronia and PHC, around 9,000 permanent and casual jobs would have been lost in one of the most remote parts of the poorest country in the world\u201d.\n\nIn November, representatives of nine communities in the DRC, including RIAO-RDC, turned to a dispute mechanism set up by German development bank DEG to air their grievances against Feronia, backed by a number of NGOs including Oxfam.\n\nSince then, according to RIAO-RDC, the groups have been subject to increasing harassment and intimidation by Feronia staff.\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Mombia Ataku, the director of RIAO-DRC, said in a statement: \u201cRIAO-DRC calls on the DEG and the other development banks that fund and hold shares in Feronia to take all measures possible to ensure that PHC-Feronia respects the human rights and dignity of the communities, peasants and workers.\n\n\u201cWe make an urgent appeal to all international human rights organisation, land defenders and other concerned groups to get involved in this situation, which is evolving from bad to worse despite the peace process that is under way.\u201d\n\nNick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now, called on DfID to conduct its own investigation into Lunea\u2019s murder in order to make informed decisions about CDC\u2019s future investment in Feronia and determine \u201cwhether restitution is owed\u201d to the communities.\n\nA spokesman for DfID said they were aware of Lunea\u2019s death and added: \u201cIt would be inappropriate to comment further while a police investigation is ongoing.\u201d\n\nFeronia did not respond to requests for comment from the Guardian.\n\nA statement on Feronia\u2019s website, posted in July, said: \u201cThe company is deeply saddened to learn that one of its employees is being sought by the police in relation to the death of Mr Jo\u00ebl Imbangola Lunea on Sunday 21 July 2019. Police are treating Mr Lunea\u2019s death as murder.\u201d\n\nThe company said it was trying to establish the facts of the case, as there were \u201cdifferent versions of events\u201d being reported.\n\n\u201cA number of witnesses have informed the company that the disagreement which led to the tragic incident was of a personal nature but, with the incident occurring approximately 18 km from Feronia\u2019s plantation, near the employee\u2019s home village, whilst he was on four weeks\u2019 annual leave, establishing facts is proving difficult.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Roger Mwasua Nzambe", "description": "Independent investigators to explore alleged involvement of security guard for palm oil company supported by CDC", "authors": ["Karen Mcveigh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c658c2509f85373f96d33cc6f5d6e67592afe4c/0_843_3448_2069/master/3448.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ee43c763791df5377e4f9755ff5dbe0b", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
