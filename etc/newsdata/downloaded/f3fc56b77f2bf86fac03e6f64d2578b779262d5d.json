And since the start of last year, CQS\u2019s funds under management have risen by almost a quarter, to about $US18 billion ($26.8 billion).\n\nWhat seems to set Hintze apart is his seemingly insatiable thirst for detail. He\u2019s a genuine markets boffin. He reportedly likes nothing better than to sit in the \u201csituation room\u201d of CQS's London office and chew the fat about geopolitics, as part of his search for alpha.\n\nBack to the floor\n\nNow that he\u2019s restructured the business he founded in 1999, which made him a billionaire and of which he was the sole boss for 19 years, he can indulge his inner boffin.\n\nHe hired Xavier Rolet, formerly head of the London Stock Exchange, as CEO at the end of last year, and in effect demoted himself: he\u2019s now CQS\u2019s \u201csenior investment officer\u201d, and sits at a standard open-plan trading desk in the middle of his team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe still retains the title of executive chairman and is the controlling shareholder, but he\u2019s happy to let Rolet pretty much run the show: product development, logistics and admin, client relationships.\n\nThe other week, he says, Rolet went to an investor conference in Japan, leaving Hintze himself free to potter around the Middle East looking at oil installations.\n\nIf I was knocked over by a bus today, it wouldn't be too flash but there would be a lot more resilience. \u2014 CQS executive chairman Sir Michael Hintze\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great. Before, I was basically doing it all,\u201d Hintze says. \u201cHe can go and focus on the strategy and executing that strategy. I do not want to get involved in that, to make his world more difficult ... I do the portfolio management and trading, which is what I want to do.\u201d\n\nIt sounds like a logical step; but the thing is that in the market\u2019s eyes, Hintze has been synonymous with CQS. He\u2019s now 66, and though he\u2019s not slowing down he does need to eliminate the risk that the business is all about him.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019d been knocked over by a bus five years ago, it would have been a real issue. If I was knocked over by a bus today, it wouldn\u2019t be too flash but there would be a lot more resilience,\u201d he says.\n\nHis other motivation is his increasing worry that if you don\u2019t keep a close eye on your clients, and on the office\u2019s back end \u2013 Rolet\u2019s two biggest jobs \u2013 your business can run into just as much trouble as if you make a few bad investments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou look at the Australian banks at the moment, they\u2019re making money for their shareholders but the nonsense that happened off the back of operational risk \u2013 the compliance, the HR \u2013 that will kill your business. That\u2019s a big deal,\u201d Hintze says.\n\nIt would be a tall order for anyone to walk into Hintze\u2019s self-built vehicle and take the wheel, particularly with Hintze still in the co-pilot\u2019s seat. But Rolet and Hintze go back a long way.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Xavier Rolet since January 9th, 1984,\u201d says Hintze. \u201cWe joined Goldman Sachs in New York together on the same day on the international trading desk, we were sitting closer than you and I are sitting right now. He joined from business school and I joined from Salomon Brothers.\u201d\n\nHe says this has meant there\u2019s a huge reservoir of trust, and he can let Rolet get on with the job. But with all that off his plate, what is Hintze focused on now?\n\nThat elusive yield\n\nCQS's London office is decorated with some of its executive chairman's personal art collection. Ian Tuttle\n\nThe big challenge is to deliver returns in a world where $US12 trillion of bonds, almost a third of the global total, are negative-yielding.\n\nHow's he doing? Besides the Directional Opportunities fund he manages, CQS's long-only Credit Multi Asset fund has produced a 6.1 per cent return so far this year, and his ABS fund 6.9 per cent (a fair way short of its annualised return of 16.4 per cent since October 2006).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut he does have to ensure his clients are braced for the mark-to-market volatility that delivering such returns brings.\n\nHe recently told clients that the credit markets\u2019 current preoccupations \u2013 growth, the quality of cash flows and leverage \u2013 had created an opening for counterinvesting at the junk end of the market.\n\n\u201cThe relative outperformance of the higher end over the lower end of the capital structure \u2026 is providing us opportunities in high yield, especially in single-B and CCC-rated securities where we are able to identify value and idiosyncratic alpha based on fundamental analysis,\u201d he wrote. (Alpha is the return over the benchmark in any asset class.)\n\n\u201cFor the second half of 2019 I like short-dated structured credit, relative value strategies, regulatory capital relief trades and special situations, especially European distressed assets.\u201d\n\nThe human eventually gets taken in by the computer. But the human and the computer, together, can always beat the computer. \u2014 Michael Hintze\n\nCQS is often referred to as a hedge fund, but the company is at pains to point out that the majority of its funds are now in long-only strategies.\n\n\u201cWe take that hedge fund DNA and apply it to the long-only business,\u201d he says. That means \u201clooking at disparate themes, trying to be more nimble in terms of how we move our portfolios around, being very happy to actively manage portfolios from one place to another. Active trading, benchmark agnostic.\u201d\n\nOne of the reasons CQS has started to go long lies in the huge growth of passive investing, where the trading is algorithm-based.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMachines are trading rather than people. And there\u2019s been very large growth in algo trading. At the same time, there\u2019s less capital put into the market-making community by the banks. So that\u2019s gone down, passives have gone up, most algos will be mean-reverting \u2026 there\u2019s a lot of noise, and it\u2019s bloody hard to get an edge unless you think about a long-term theme.\u201d\n\nQuantum leap\n\nHe sees investors as voters, the market as a voting mechanism.\n\nIn the algo-trading era, the average holding period in the US market is about 24 seconds \u2013 \u201calgos will potentially trade in and out, they can trade that capital anything up to 20 times a day. So they\u2019ll swamp the votes that long-only guys have. That\u2019s one of the reasons why active managers find it hard to perform\u201d.\n\nHintze doesn\u2019t think he can out-trade a machine, but he backs himself to \u201cout-invest\u201d it.\n\nIn chess, Deep Blue beat a human champion. But for Hintze, that\u2019s only the start of the story. \u201cThe interesting thing about it, and one of the reasons we\u2019re moving more into AI and machine learning, is that the human eventually gets taken in by the computer. But the human and the computer, together, can always beat the computer. That\u2019s the next iteration,\u201d he says.\n\nFor him, the human\u2019s x-factor is imagination. He doesn\u2019t think machines can size up geopolitics, for example.\n\nBut he\u2019s not a luddite: his next step is quantum computing. A quantum chip makes instantaneous a risk analysis that right now takes hours or even days, potentially offering a significant time advantage.\n\n\u201cIt enables you look at the whole matrix at once, rather than in a binary way. It\u2019s not there yet though,\u201d he says.\n\nIt sounds like Hintze still has plenty of unfinished business.", "description": "Michael Hintze, founder of $26.8b asset manager CQS, has handed over the CEO job to someone else.
