But many people still do not use them, and of those that do, many don't use them properly.\n\nAccording to a recent survey of 1,000 adults by Yuhan-Kimberly, less than half used masks designed specifically for dust suppression, while 25 percent wore regular masks, which are ineffective in preventing dust, and 3.2 percent used cotton masks designed to keep warm. About 22.4 percent said they do not use masks at all.\n\nUltrafine dust particles are so tiny that they are not filtered by nostril hair or respiratory cilia and can penetrate deep into the lungs, causing various respiratory diseases.", "description": "Wearing Masks Becomes the Norm Amid Fine Dust Concerns", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/05/06/2019050600340_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-06"}
