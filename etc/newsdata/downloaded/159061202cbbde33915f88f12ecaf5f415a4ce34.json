But most consumers are unaware of what the composting process actually involves.\n\nThere are two kinds of municipal composting: aerobic (with oxygen) and anaerobic (without oxygen) digestion. In both cases, micro-organisms break down biodegradable material into compost that can later be used as fertilizer.\n\nAerobic digestion, also known as traditional composting, is the more low-tech, and is done in jurisdictions such as Metro Vancouver and Nova Scotia.\n\nThis facility on Disco Road collects up to 75 per cent of Toronto\u2019s organic waste and converts it into something renewable. (Craig Chivers/CBC)\n\nIn its simplest form, traditional composting requires making a pile of wet organic matter \u4e00 made up of yard waste, food scraps and occasionally sewage \u4e00 and waiting several months for the waste to break down into humus (which is compost that's mainly used for conditioning soil). This is something you can do in your backyard.\n\nWith anaerobic digestion, food waste is put in an oxygen-free environment, instead of being piled up and left in the open air.\n\nDianne Saxe, the former environmental commissioner of Ontario who now leads the consultancy Saxe Facts, said that traditional composting doesn't collect the methane released during the process, which can be used as a source of energy.\n\nAs a result, the methane \u2014 a potent greenhouse gas \u2014 is released into the atmosphere, \"which is what happens in the landfill as well,\" Saxe said.\n\nAnaerobic digestion\n\nAnaerobic digestion is the less common variety of composting in Canada. According to a survey of Ontario municipalities, only about 30 per cent of responding municipalities in the province use it. But they include the biggest city in the country: Toronto.\n\nThe facility on Disco Road collects up to 75 per cent of Toronto's organic waste and converts it into something renewable. The air inside the facility is thick and heavy. The smell of rotting garbage is so strong you can feel it permeating your skin and sticking to your clothes.\n\nDuring a recent visit, Derek Sawyer, supervisor of organic processing in Toronto, pointed to a towering pile of compost bin waste, all stuffed into bags of various colours and sizes.\n\nThe waste, all residential, sat wrapped in layers of plastic before it was piled onto conveyor belts by a large, green excavator, where it will be taken to a large, loud machine called the hydro pulper.\n\nDerek Sawyer is the supervisor of organic processing in the City of Toronto. (Craig Chivers/CBC)\n\nThe hydro pulper is a large, whirring machine that uses water to remove non-compostable materials, known as contaminants. Sawyer said contaminants can comprise up to 18 per cent of every batch.\n\nThose contaminants include items that residents are asked to put in the green bin, and that many believe to be compostable \u2014 such as disposable diapers, biodegradable bags and sanitary napkins.\n\nThe light materials \u2014 plastic bags, diapers, compostable forks and straws \u2014 float to the top of the pulper, where they are skimmed away by a giant claw machine.\n\nThe heavier contaminants \u2014 glass, metal, dirt and shells \u2014 fall to the bottom, where they are ground up and filtered out before all being shipped to the landfill. Even items that could be recycled, such as metal and glass, end up as garbage.\n\nRecyclables head to dump\n\nThe organic waste becomes a sludge, ground up and sopping wet, before being squeezed out and brought to large metal bins called anaerobic digesters. In the digesters, micro-organisms, in the absence of oxygen, break down the material to produce the pre-compost stage \u2014 called digester solids \u2014 and release biogas, a mix of methane and carbon dioxide.\n\nToronto residents are encouraged to put plastic bags and diapers in their green bins, but those materials are eventually sifted out and sent to landfill. (Craig Chivers/CBC)\n\nThe digester solids are then sent to a third-party company \u2014 in this case, All Treat Farms, about two hours west of Toronto \u2014 to be heated, aerated and turned into usable compost.\n\nThe biogas is filtered out with big fans, and used to mix and heat the anaerobic digesters, as well as burned to keep the facility warm during the winter months. Some of it is also used to heat the digester tanks in the facility.\n\nDisco Road currently burns the remaining gas. In the future, the City of Toronto hopes to sell it as a more renewable and sustainable type of fuel used for heating and vehicles.\n\nAll liquids \u2014 liquid digestate, rainwater and all other water used on-site \u2014 is collected and purified so that it can supply most of the facility's water needs, mainly for drinking and to clean instruments.\n\nAerobic digestion\n\nAerobic digestion creates nutrient-rich fertilizer without diverting partially decomposed waste to a different facility.\n\nIt can still be a complicated, multi-step process, where staff measure how much water, air, carbon and nitrogen-rich materials go into the pile.\n\nEach ingredient does its part in the decomposition process:\n\nOxygen oxidizes the carbon, which sparks the process.\n\nCarbon produces the energy and heat needed.\n\nNitrogen encourages the growth and reproduction of micro-organisms.\n\nWater maintains the microbes needed to decompose.\n\nThe process is started by shredding yard waste, adding water and regularly stirring or turning the pile. Bacteria and fungi that need oxygen to survive manage the decomposition by converting the materials not only into compost, but also into heat, methane, carbon dioxide and ammonium.\n\nWith both aerobic and anaerobic digestion, the final product - compost - is sold to farms, plant nurseries, grocery stores and garden centres. (Craig Chivers/CBC)\n\nThis method can be shortened from months into just two to three weeks.\n\nWith both aerobic and anaerobic digestion, the final product \u2014 compost \u2014 is sold to farms, plant nurseries, grocery stores and garden centres.\n\nBut the majority of Canadian organic waste still ends up in the landfill. Ontario throws out two million tonnes alone a year alone, the Ontario government reports.\n\nAccording to Saxe, looking at organic waste as a resource can help raise awareness and build an industry based on the principles of the circular economy.", "description": "In many communities, residents are asked to separate food waste into bins for municipal composting.\u00a0Here's a closer look at what actually gets composted and how, what happens to the rest, and where it all ends up.", "authors": ["Taylor Logan Is A Lover Of Gardens", "Everything That Lives In Them.
