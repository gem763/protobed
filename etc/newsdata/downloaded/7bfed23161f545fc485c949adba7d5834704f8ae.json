MediaLab just acquired the popular anonymous chat app and plans to invest in its future, according to a company blog post Saturday boasting how \u201cKik is here to stay!\u201d The app had one foot in the grave ever since its creator and previous owner, Kik Interactive, announced last month it was pulling its plug and pivoting their focus to cryptocurrency.\n\nKik Interactive\u2019s CEO Ted Livingston hinted at this acquisition earlier this month in a tweet saying a \u201cgreat company\u201d had agreed to buy their app to \u201ccontinue growing it for our millions of users.\u201d\n\nSome exciting news: we may have found a home for Kik! We just signed an LOI with a great company. They want to buy the app, continue growing it for our millions of users, and take the Kin integration to the next level. Not a done deal yet, but could be a great win win.

As of 2017, Techcrunch reported Whisper had 20 million daily active users across its app and website.\n\nWhile MediaLab eventually plans to tackle some long-requested features like increased group sizes and the option to kick inactive group admins, first the company plans on \u201cgetting back to the basics.\u201d Fixing bugs, blocking spam bots, and improving the app\u2019s speed and reliability will be top priorities these next few months and some features like video chat toggle and third-party bots are going back to the drawing board altogether. MediaLab\u2019s also introducing in-app ads to help cover costs, which should roll out over the next few weeks.\n\n\u201cWe believe that Kik\u2019s best days remain ahead of it,\u201d the MediaLab team said in its statement.\n\nIn his previous announcement about Kik\u2019s shutdown, Livingston said the company\u2019s staff would be shrinking down to 19, a move that would purportedly affect more than 100 employees and their families. Saturday\u2019s blog post didn\u2019t provide any updates whether these plans would continue, and Kik Interactive did not immediately respond to Gizmodo\u2019s inquiry.\n\nThe company said in September that it intended to redirect resources towards its cryptocurrency, Kin, following a lengthy legal battle with the U.S. Security Exchange Commission that Livingston described at the time as \u201ca long and expensive process to drain our resources.\u201d The SEC sued Kik Interactive back in June over $146 million the company raised via an initial coin offering in 2017, which the SEC argued qualified as an illegal, unregistered securities offering.", "description": "It looks like Kik hasn\u2019t quite kicked the bucket yet (heh).
