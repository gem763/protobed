That move will now be known as the \"Biles II.\"\n\nThe gymnast also nailed her double-double dismount from the balance beam. The move, which consists of a double-twisting double backflip, will now be named the \"Biles.\"\n\nTeam USA YouTube\n\n\"I feel like I'm pretty pleased just because that's how I train beam, and it finally felt good to go out there and hit a beam routine like I train because I feel like every time I go up to compete beam, I just bomb it,\" Biles told the Olympic Channel. \"So it felt really good to just nail it.\"\n\nBiles said she thinks that she can still do better, but was happy with what she accomplished at the tournament.\n\n\"My goal going into tonight was to not be great ... it wasn't to do great, but just to do well, and I feel like I accomplished that,\" she said.\n\nBiles has two other moves named after her, one on vault and the other on floor.\n\nIn addition to her individual success, Team USA came in first place in the qualifying standings with a total score of 174.205, followed by China and Russia.\n\nBiles also came out on top in qualifying for all-around, beam and floor. She was second on vault and seventh on uneven bars.\n\nAt 22-years-old, Biles has 20 worlds medals, just three behind the record held by Belarusian Vitaly Scherbo. Her performance at this year's world championships has the potential to make her the most decorated gymnast in the history of the competition.\n\nMore of Biles' performance at the world competition can be seen here.", "description": "The 22-year-old star gymnast landed a double-double dismount from the balance beam that will now be known as the \"Biles,\" and a triple-double that is being dubbed the \"Biles II.\"", "authors": ["Wynne Davis"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/06/gettyimages-1179319004_wide-3846562afcf85dbb84b9eb92cf6a0156a21801b7.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
