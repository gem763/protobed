Bill Weld, former South Carolina governor and congressman Mark Sanford and former Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois have been invited by Business Insider to participate in a debate Sept. 24.\n\nWeld and Walsh\u2019s campaigns told Fox News they would be attending the debate. Sanford\u2019s campaign was optimistic its candidate would also take the stage as long as a scheduling conflict was resolved.\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENITAL CAMPAIGN\n\nBusiness Insider told Fox News that the debate will be streamed live on Business Insider Today, their daily news show on Facebook Watch. They added that the president -- who has derided his primary opponents as the \"Three Stooges\" -- was invited to participate but has not responded.\n\n\u201cThe political landscape has changed immeasurably since Donald Trump ran for and was elected president,\" said Nicholas Carlson, the global editor-in-chief of Insider Inc. \"It\u2019s vitally important to have an honest conversation about what it means to be a Republican in the era of Trump; our debate will be a valuable part of that discussion.\"\n\nAn optimistic Weld told Fox News that \u201cwe already have our first televised debate signed up for and that\u2019s going to add a new dimension to the race and I think it\u2019s going to be harder and harder for the Trump forces to ignore the fact that 2020 is an election year.\u201d\n\nTrump told reporters Monday at the White House that \u201cthey\u2019re all at less than 1 percent. I guess it\u2019s a publicity stunt\u2026.I\u2019m not looking to give them any credibility\u201d\n\nPrimary challenges against sitting presidents running for re-election are far from rare. Former California Gov. Ronald Reagan took on Republican President Gerald Ford in 1976. Four years later then-Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts primary challenged Democratic President Jimmy Carter. And conservative pundit Pat Buchanan took on Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1992.\n\nNone of the incumbents shared the debate stage with their challengers. While the primary challenges all failed, each of the incumbent presidents ended up losing in the general election.\n\nThe debate announcement comes days after a move by the Republican parties in South Carolina and Nevada \u2013 two of the first four states that kick off the presidential primary and caucus calendar \u2013 to not hold their nominating contests next year. The Republican Party in Kansas also announced they won\u2019t be holding their caucus.\n\nWeld, who launched a primary challenge against Trump in April, argued on Tuesday that the scrapping of the contests is a sign that the president\u2019s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee are starting to worry about the multiple primary challenges.\n\n\u201cIt indicates that there\u2019s a nervousness in Washington D.C. and I think for good reason,\u201d he told Fox News after holding a campaign event in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire.\n\nWalsh, a longtime conservative radio talk show host, was less diplomatic, saying on Twitter that Trump was acting \u201clike a mob boss.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThis is wrong. This is undemocratic. This is what a political party does when it serves a King,\u201d he said.\n\nWalsh also said \u201cit\u2019s disappointing. We should never take our cues from North Korea on shutting down elections and people's chances to make their voices heard. South Carolina's unique place as the first Republican primary in the South is being lost next year to accommodate the President's electoral hopes.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThis means South Carolina Republicans in all corners of our state will lose voice they have had in the past in the national debate. It also means the very ideas debated in Republican circles will be weaker given the way ideas are made stronger through debate and examination. It's all unnecessary, but certainly consistent with the President's less than democratic style.\"\n\nBut Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said that \u201cthese are decisions made entirely by state parties, and there are volumes of historical precedents to support them.\u201d\n\nHe also emphasized that \u201cPresident Trump will dominate and prevail in whatever contest is placed before him.\"", "description": "The three long-shot challengers taking on President Trump in the 2020 primaries are expected to face-off in their own debate later this month.", "authors": ["Paul Steinhauser", "Paul Steinhauser Is A Politics Reporter Based In New Hampshire."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Weld-Wash-Sanford-Getty.jpg"}
