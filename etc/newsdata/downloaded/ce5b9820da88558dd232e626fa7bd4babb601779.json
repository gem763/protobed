The most fortunate have a bed to lie on, but most of them just sit directly on the floor, exposing amputation stumps and bandaged wounds.\n\nThe prison clinic is as crowded as the other cells. A greying man with axillary crutches painstakingly picks his way through the ghostly crowd.\n\nThe condition of the wounded speaks of the intensity of the fighting that led to IS's final territorial defeat at the hands of the Kurdish-led fighters of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in March.\n\nIt also reveals the dire conditions experienced by the final denizens of the jihadist \"caliphate\" when it made its last stand in Baghouz district, 200 kilometres (125 miles) to the south.\n\nMost of the men who have been crammed into this Hasakeh province detention centre and at least six others across Kurdish-held territory are those who were seen limping to surrender just months ago, starved and mutilated.\n\n\"I want to leave the prison and go back home to my family,\" says Aseel Mathan, 22.\n\nThe lank young man left his native Wales when he was still 17, to join his brother in Mosul, the northern Iraqi city where the IS \"caliphate\" was born.\n\nWhen his brother was killed, he moved across the Syrian border to Raqa, the other main hub of the now-defunct jihadist proto-state.\n\n- 'No contact' -\n\n\"I want to go back to Britain,\" Mathan said, adding he wished he hadn't answered the call to arms issued in 2014 by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the IS leader who was killed in a US raid hours after the young Welshman spoke to AFP.\n\nAccording to the Kurdish authorities, more than 50 nationalities are represented in the Kurdish-run prisons where more than 12,000 IS suspects are now held.\n\n\"They have absolutely no contact with the outside world,\" says the prison governor, who gave his name as Serhat and asked that the exact location of the facility be withheld.\n\nNot all IS fighters were caught by Kurdish and US-led coalition forces in the dying days of the \"caliphate\" and the jihadist group has continued to attack its enemies through clandestine cells roaming the region.\n\nSome days, Sarhat says, fugitive jihadists \"come near the prison and open fire, just as a way of telling the detainees that they are still there.\"\n\nFrom France to Tunisia, many of the IS prisoners' countries of origins have been reluctant to repatriate them, fearing a public backlash at home.\n\nWith support from their main US ally more unpredictable than ever, and under constant pressure from their archfoe Turkey, the Syrian Kurds' autonomous administration can barely protect itself, let alone foreign detainees.\n\n- 'Dangerous' -\n\nKurdish forces have repeatedly warned that a Turkish invasion -- which became a reality on October 9 -- could result in mass prison breaks that would release some of the world's most fanatic terrorists into the region, and beyond.\n\nAccording to a senior US official, more than 100 already broke out.", "description": "Behind the steel door, the cell is as packed as their eyes are empty -- haggard, scrawny prisoners in orange jumpsuits lying head-to-tail cover every inch of floor space.
