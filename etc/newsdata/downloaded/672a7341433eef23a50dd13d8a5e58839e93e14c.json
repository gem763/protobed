The S&P 500 dropped 0.2%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5%.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee released early Thursday a whistleblower complaint related to President Trump and Ukraine, shortly before the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, was set to testify before the panel.\n\nAlthough the markets earlier this week appeared to discount the specter of an impeachment, investors remain sensitive to political uncertainty in the nation's capital.\n\n\"It will increase the gridlock in Washington and make it harder for President Trump to force his agenda and narratives,\" Cantor Fitzgerald strategist Peter Cecchini said in a research note.\n\nInvestors and traders also continued to monitor the state of trade talks between the U.S. and China.\n\nChina's Commerce Ministry said Thursday that Chinese companies had agreed to buy \"sizable amounts\" of soybeans and pork from the U.S. ahead of high-level talks scheduled for next month. President Trump also voiced optimism about a deal.\n\n\"While the U.S. still remains unlikely to strike a deal in the immediate future, Trump is certainly talking up markets and for the most part, he has been successful,\" said IG's Joshua Mahony, though he added that markets are growing more skeptical with each failed meeting.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade war has dented business spending and manufacturing activity, leading some analysts to predict a weak third-quarter earnings season.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department said gross domestic product -- a broad measure of the goods and services produced across the U.S. -- was unrevised in the second quarter, although a key measure of corporate profits was revised lower. U.S. jobless claims increased slightly last week, according to the Labor Department.\n\nThe yield on U.S. 10-year Treasurys slipped to 1.685% from 1.732% Wednesday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.\n\nOverseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 climbed 0.6%, with the German DAX 0.5% higher and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 down 0.02%.\n\nBetter-than-expected consumer data released Thursday showed that German shoppers remained somewhat resilient in the face of a sharp slowdown in the industrial sector.\n\nAdding to the positive news, the European Central Bank said eurozone bank lending to businesses -- which is seen by economists as an indicator of economic health -- accelerated last month.\n\nMeanwhile, the ECB's most senior German official unexpectedly resigned Wednesday amid disputes over the central bank's bond-buying program, and analysts suggested the move could have an effect on the bank's decision making.\n\n\"This might open up a spot for a more dovish member to replace her, which could make any further attempts to ease policy a little easier, further down the line,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.\n\nIn the U.K., some stocks benefited from a softer pound, while others were lifted by the positive comments on U.S.-China trade, said CMC Markets analyst David Madden.\n\nIn Asia, the Nikkei climbed 0.1% after the U.S. and Japan signed a trade-enhancement agreement, which will lower agricultural tariffs in Japan, industrial tariffs in the U.S. and set new rules for digital trade.\n\nOther Asian markets were more mixed, with stocks in Shanghai down 0.9%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng up 0.4% and Korea's Kospi edged up 0.1%.\n\nIn commodity markets, U.S. crude dropped 1.1%. Gold prices added 0.3%.\n\nWrite to Max Bernhard at Max.Bernhard@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 26, 2019 10:19 ET (14:19 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
