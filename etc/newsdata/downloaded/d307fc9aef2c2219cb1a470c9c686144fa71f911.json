It took Hanson about 18 months to find a $340,000 row house that met her benchmark, and it was far from her preferred neighborhood.\n\nBut Hanson has no regrets that she stuck to her guns even though she was qualified by her lender for a home costing up to $430,000.\n\n\u201cThis is the largest purchase I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d says Hanson, a lobbyist. \u201cI want to make sure I\u2019m very comfortable financially.\u201d\n\nMillennials have been driving home sales the past few years but they\u2019re doing so cautiously.

About 76% of 22- to 38-year-old recent homebuyers spent less than 30% of their monthly income on housing costs in 2017, the latest data available show. That\u2019s up from 69% in 2000 and 65% in 2009, according to Census Bureau figures.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have all my money go to a mortgage so that I can\u2019t travel or have a drink or have fun,\u201d says Hanson, who visited dozens of homes during her house hunt and was routinely outbid since she wouldn\u2019t go more than a few thousand dollars above asking price.\n\nHanson was also frugal about her down payment, plunking down 3% of the purchase price.\n\nMany young households \"learned a lesson\" from the drop in home prices a decade ago, says Doug Duncan, chief economist of Fannie Mae. \u201cThey\u2019re being conservative.\u201d\n\nMillennial home buyers are being cautious about how much of their monthly incomes they're devoting to housing costs.

Devoting too much income to housing costs also can make it difficult to continue making house payments in case of a job loss or unforeseen medical expense.\n\nHomeless in college:Students sleep in cars, on couches when they have nowhere else to go\n\nYour credit score: Two new tools can help you achieve a good score\n\nThe share of frugal young homebuyers staying under the 30% income-to-housing costs threshold was just 54% during the tail end of the housing boom in 2006 and has climbed steadily since. It has been roughly flat at about 75% since 2013. That\u2019s despite a strengthening labor market and faster wage growth, and lending standards that increasingly eased starting in 2014 before leveling off the past couple of years.\n\nA closer look shows millennials are being particularly prudent. The median income-to-housing cost ratio for 23- to 37-year-old homeowners has dropped from 18% in 2002 to 15.8% in 2017, the largest decrease among age groups from 18 to 62, according to Trulia, a real estate research firm.\n\nRick Morrison, a Redfin broker who represented Hanson, estimates that about half his millennial house-hunting clients set very conservative price ceilings and won\u2019t exceed them even if they constrain their ability to find a suitable home. About 3 in 10, he estimates, give up without making a purchase.\n\nBesides guarding against a potential slide in prices, there are other reasons millennials are being thrifty about home purchases:\n\nExperiences over things\n\nYoung people value other things, like experiences, above owning a home. More Americans in their 20s and 30s (56% to 79%) cited good health, financial security, leisure time and a happy marriage than home ownership (56% to 61%) as factors contributing to a good life, according to a 2017 survey by market research firm Gfk Global.\n\nStudent debt burdens\n\nOther expenses, especially student loan debt, are making young adults reluctant to spend too much on housing, says Danielle Hale, chief economist of realtor.com, a website of real estate listings and tools. Student debt has hit a record $1.5 trillion, with millennials on the hook for much of that tab.\n\n\u201cStudent loan (bills) are out of control,\u201d says Hanson, who has about $180,000 in college and law school debt that\u2019s costing her several hundred dollars a month.\n\nJob hopping\n\nWith unemployment at a 50-year low and job openings near a record high, millennials are increasingly hopping from one job to the next, often with lags of weeks or months in between, says Daryl Fairweather, chief economist of Redfin. As a result, she says, they want to build enough savings to tide them over, a goal that becomes less feasible if their mortgages eat up their income.\n\nDiversifying investments\n\nJust 48% of older millennials and Gen Xers believe real estate is a better long-term investment than the stock market, according to a survey commissioned by Redfin in December.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to put all their eggs in one basket,\u201d Fairweather says.\n\nHanson, for example, says she wants to save up so her daughter can go to college.\n\nDuncan says millennials\u2019 prudent approach is generally healthy. At the same time, young adults who refuse to budge even slightly from their price or monthly spending limits \u201cmight miss some opportunities to build wealth\u201d through housing, he says.\n\nMore: Chinese parents are paying for their kids to learn English from US online tutors. Here's how the job works\n\nPrices for entry-level homes \u2013 the category typically targeted by millennials \u2013 have jumped an average 8% a year since 2012, compared with 6.4% and 5% increases for mid- and high-priced homes, respectively, according to Trulia. That means millennials often may need to bid up to buy a house.\n\nHale agrees, adding that millennials should be aware of the trade-offs they\u2019re making by remaining renters: Their rents will continue to rise, while payments on 30-year mortgages are fixed.\n\nAnd Fairweather notes young adults almost certainly will continue to get raises, lowering the share of income they devote to house payments over time.\n\nFor Hanson, the calculus was simple. Her landlord was about to hike her monthly rent by several hundred dollars. Now, she\u2019s paying significantly less for a home that needs some work but is about 1,100 square feet, compared to her 700-square-foot luxury apartment.\n\n\"I've been paying crazy rent every single month,\" she says. \"I didn't want my mortgage to be sucking everything out of me.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/06/11/millennials-buy-homes-cautiously-trying-spend-less-housing/1386957001/", "description": "Millennials have been driving home sales the past few years but they\u2019re doing so cautiously.", "authors": ["Paul Davidson", "Published A.M.
