Here are the lawmakers who aren't running again in 2020\u201d are prefect examples of the national media narrative.\n\nDONNA BRAZILE SAYS DEMS SHOULD BE 'STRATEGIC' ON IMPEACHMENT UNTIL ALL FACTS ARE OUT\n\nThe problem with this narrative is it\u2019s misleading and incomplete.\n\nWhat the trivia-focused, national media doesn\u2019t seem to understand is that members of Congress are supposed to retire. And there is a large, diverse, exciting crop of smart Republican candidates throughout the country, who are seeking to bring new blood to Congress.\n\nRepublicans like to hear new ideas from new people. Republicans like revolutions and change. That\u2019s the reason our leadership has term limits and the average age of Republican members of elected leadership is 18 years younger than Nancy Pelosi and her Democratic leadership (53 vs 71). It\u2019s why the average age of Republican ranking members in House committees is 60, versus 67 for the Democratic chairpersons.\n\nConsider this when you think about the images that the national media uses when it describes the parties in Congress. According to the media, the Democrats are all young, fresh-faced, idealistic members, while Republicans are all old members, who have served for eons.\n\nI spent a good part of last week in Washington meeting with the various Republican committees \u2013 and briefly with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. He was actually the one who got me thinking about this column. When I asked him about the most recent spate of retirements, he told me he just wasn\u2019t worried about it.\n\nNo one in the national media is telling the story of the tremendous recruitment effort the GOP is engaging. Nor are any mainstream outlets doing profile pieces on new, first-time GOP candidates (nothing like we saw with the rise of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez).\n\nHe then rattled off several new House candidates, who he thought would bring many new, good ideas to Washington. This led me to do my own research, and Leader McCarthy was right.\n\nNo one in the national media is telling the story of the tremendous recruitment effort the GOP is engaging.

More than 100 were women, more than 100 were minorities, and more than 100 were veterans.\n\nHere are a few examples (I don\u2019t personally know, and have not met, many of the candidates, but I wanted to share a flavor):\n\nAshley Hinson (IA-01) is a former TV news anchor and State Senator in Cedar.\n\nWesley Hunt (TX-07) is an African-American West Point graduate who flew Apache helicopters in the Army before returning to Texas.\n\nYoung Kim (CA-39) is a former Congressional aide, who became the first Korean-American Republican elected to the State Assembly in 2014.\n\nMichelle Fischbach (MN-07) previously served as lieutenant governor of Minnesota and president of the Minnesota Senate.\n\nNicole Malliotakis (NY-11) is a Cuban-Greek-American who has represented portions of Brooklyn and Staten Island in the NY State Assembly since 2010.\n\nMichelle Steel (CA-48), whom I know well \u2013 and have endorsed \u2013 was born in Korea. She currently serves as the vice chair of the Orange County Board of Supervisors and previously served on the California State Board of Equalization.\n\nFinally, Maria Elvira Salazar (FL-27) is the daughter of Cuban exiles.
