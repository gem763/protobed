Joe Kenda reveals the one case that haunts him the most", "language": "en", "text": "For Joe Kenda, the case is finally closed.\n\nOn Aug. 21, \u201cHomicide Hunter: Lt. Joe Kenda\u201d began its ninth and final season on Investigation Discovery (ID).\n\n\u2018DEADLY WOMEN\u2019 HOST CANDICE DELONG SAYS FEW ARE \u2018BORN EVIL,\u2019 BELIEVES THERE ARE MORE UNDISCOVERED FEMALE KILLERS\n\nThe true-crime series, which originally launched in 2011, features the 73-year-old reflecting on his many shocking cases from his 23 years with the Colorado Springs Police Department. The veteran lawman is revered for having a 92 percent solve rate on the more 350 murder cases he\u2019s investigated.\n\nThe no-nonsense veteran lawman told Fox News he\u2019s eager to move on.\n\n\u201cI am more than ready to say goodbye because it was my idea,\u201d explained Kenda. \u201cI ended this program and I informed Discovery that I would be stopping after season nine. The reason was rather simple. I had run out of cases, I ran out of bullets. What I have remaining are either too simple or too disgusting. Children, babies \u2014 I won\u2019t do those. The network won\u2019t do those either. So [I don\u2019t] have enough reasonable\u2026 presentable stories to tell on television. So it\u2019s better to go out at the top of your game than to be the athlete who played one season too long.\u201d\n\nKenda spent 21 years catching killers in the violent crimes unit and 19 of them were served as a homicide detective. During his tenure, Kenda and his team solved 356 of his 387 homicide cases, one of the highest closure rates in the country. However, Kenda admitted it wasn\u2019t always easy to relive chilling memories of brutal slayings that still haunt him in front of cameras. Still, he said the experience was therapeutic over the years.\n\nRELATIVES OF SHARON TATE, JAY SEBRING SPEAK OUT ON HORRIFYING MANSON MURDERS 50 YEARS LATER\n\n\u201cIt allows me to release some of the emotions I\u2019ve felt and discuss things,\u201d he said. \u201cIt becomes therapeutic for me for that reason. I\u2019ve said more to that camera than I\u2019ve ever said to my wife. It makes me feel better having done so, to talk about it. It doesn\u2019t go away, but it makes you feel better.\u201d\n\nThe Post-Gazette previously reported Kenda joined the local police department in Colorado Springs, Colo., in 1973 and retired after more than two decades as a detective in 1996. He revealed that out of all the cases he\u2019s worked on and featured on the show, there\u2019s one horrific story that still shakes him to his core.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one particular case that haunts me the most because it reminded me of the fragility of life in my own children,\u201d he said. \u201cVery long story short, I saw a child murdered by his own father. Shot twice in the head, age five in bed clutching a stuffed animal. The bed was a downward angle so the kid bled out. He\u2019s in a river of blood and he\u2019s wearing Mickey Mouse pajamas. My son had those pajamas. Now at the time I saw that child, my son was 19 years old, but at that moment that was my son laying in that bed.\u201d\n\nAs for the cases he couldn\u2019t solve, Kenda said there\u2019s still hope.\n\nRON GOLDMAN\u2019S SISTER SPEAKS OUT 25 YEARS AFTER HIS HORRIFYING MURDER IN \u2018CONFRONTING O.J. SIMPSON\u2019 PODCAST\n\n\u201cThree of them already have,\u201d said Kenda. \u201cOut of 31, I\u2019m down to 28. I didn\u2019t resolve those three but they\u2019ve been resolved through advances in DNA technology\u2026 Cold cases are effective to work for a number of reasons. People lose their fear of a suspect, they fall out of love with a suspect, they are overcome by guilt because they have knowledge of this crime and have never told anyone. All sorts of things can happen.\u201d\n\nKenda said that out of all the killers he\u2019s encountered, it was the sociopath who\u2019s undoubtedly the most dangerous. According to Kenda, the only emotion they\u2019re capable of is rage. And while sociopaths are rare, they do exist.\n\n\u201cWhen you encounter one, you have to put him in a cage,\u201d said Kenda. \u201cBecause he kills [and] likes it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI met a guy, the first guy I ever encountered who killed multiple victims, was devoid of all emotion \u2014 just devoid,\u201d continued Kenda. \u201cHe is under arrest for three counts of murder in another jurisdiction. I have him brought to my location because I want to talk to him about my killing. Now you would think he\u2019d be pretty distressed having come into another police department about another murder. He\u2019s sitting in an interview room in handcuffs and belly chains and County Jail coveralls and he\u2019s asleep on his forearm because he\u2019s bored.\u201d\n\nNANCY GRACE RECALLS FIANC\u00c9 KEITH GRIFFIN\u2019S HORRIFIC MURDER, RETURNING TO TV WITH \u2018INJUSTICE\u2019: \u2018I WAS LOST\u2019\n\nAnd in all his years catching bad guys, Kenda said there are three key motives that would drive someone to kill.\n\n\u201cWhen people get involved in violence, they have a reason,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might be a completely insane reason but it's a reason. And they fall into three general headline categories \u2014 money first, sex next, and revenge last. There are many, many subheadings under each of those headlines.\n\n\u201cMoney for nonpayment, money for believed debt on and on and on. It goes on and on. Sex, the triangle, the sexual assault candidate who likes to kill his victims, huge list there. Revenge, over what? Over lost love, lost money, lost property, something. People have that reason. Five percent of murders are committed by people who just like to kill people and those are the serial killers, there're very few of those. The rest all fall into those general headline categories.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cHomicide Hunter\u201d may be coming to an end, don\u2019t expect Kenda to sit back and enjoy retirement. He said there\u2019s a new series in development slated for the fall of 2020. But if there\u2019s one thing Kenda hopes longtime fans of the series, as well as curious viewers, will get from the final season it's the secret behind his success in delivering closure to grieving families.\n\nDEADLY LOVE TRIANGLE INVOLVING TEXAS OILMAN, 71, AND HEIRESS, 35, EXPLORED IN SHOCKING TRUE CRIME DOC\n\n\u201cDetermination,\u201d said Kenda. \u201cThat\u2019s all you need. You need an undying sense of curiosity. How did this happen? Somebody made this happen. You have to turn that show in the night into somebody with a first, middle and last [name]. It\u2019s great fun. Very frustrating, but great fun.\u201d\n\n\"Homicide Hunter\" airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. on ID.", "description": "For Joe Kenda, the case is finally closed.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/29/694940094001_6079335390001_6079327211001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-29"}
