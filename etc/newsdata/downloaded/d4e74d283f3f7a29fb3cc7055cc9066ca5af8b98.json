Green, other targets", "language": "en", "text": "NFL teams have precious hours to solidify their rosters before the home stretch. Which clubs are willing to make a splash?\n\nThe NFL trade deadline is at 4 p.m. ET on Tuesday, and several teams already have made significant moves, most notably the undefeated New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers, who added wide receivers Mohamed Sanu and Emmanuel Sanders, respectively.\n\nBut reports suggest both clubs may not be done dealing, and there are a number of big names -- Cincinnati Bengals wideout A.J. Green among them -- who could be moved in the next 24 hours.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSo, what's the latest trade deadline scuttlebutt? We'll track every notable rumor and deal in the live blog below. (All times Eastern.)\n\n3:55 p.m.: No fireworks in store for the deadline.\n\nAll quiet on many other fronts as well. A dud of a trading deadline finale today. https://t.co/R3q1gvocRQ \u2014 Mike Garafolo (@MikeGarafolo) October 29, 2019\n\n3:51 p.m.: Which side will blink first?\n\nStory continues\n\nI'm told the stare down continues between the #Browns and the #Redskins regarding LT Trent Williams. A source just text me, \"the Skins are still holding firm on what they want in return.\" Browns GM John Dorsey not bending, at this minute. \u2014 ig: josinaanderson (@JosinaAnderson) October 29, 2019\n\n3:45 p.m.: It doesn't sound like Robby Anderson will be traded.\n\nThe best offer the #Jets have gotten so far for speedy WR Robby Anderson is a 4th round pick, according to @mortreport \u2014 Dov Kleiman (@NFL_DovKleiman) October 29, 2019\n\n3:00 p.m.: The Patriots are in the market for a kicker, per the MMQB's Albert Breer.\n\nThe Patriots are cutting K Mike Nugent, per sources. \u2014 Albert Breer (@AlbertBreer) October 29, 2019\n\n2:51 p.m.: So much for those Le'Veon Bell trade rumors?\n\nBarring a last-hour change, the Jets don't plan to trade RB Le'Veon Bell before today's 4 pm deadline, per source. Jets received calls, but not enough interest to make a deal. \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) October 29, 2019\n\n2:49 p.m.: Here's the latest on the Jamal Adams-to-Dallas rumors as we approach one hour to go...\n\nOn Jamal Adams and the #Cowboys: I'm told the #Jets are asking for more than a 1st rounder (as they should) and that a deal right is not close or imminent. It could happen, but there isn't momentum for it right now. 72 minutes to go. \u2014 Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) October 29, 2019\n\n2:23 p.m.: Is Jamal Adams heading to Dallas? That's apparently where he wants to be.\n\nESPN's Ryan Clark said Jets' S Jamal Adams would like to go home to Texas and play for the Cowboys. \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) October 29, 2019\n\n2:18 p.m.: The Bucs reportedly aren't budging on O.J. Howard.\n\nWhen one team recently called the #Bucs on former 1st round TE OJ Howard, that team was told he's not available, per me and @TomPelissero. That is where this stands right now. \u2014 Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) October 29, 2019\n\n2:10 p.m.: It appears Jets wide receiver Robby Anderson is still on the trade block.\n\nThe #Jets are also fielding calls on WR Robby Anderson, as you'd expect. There is interest. https://t.co/45PLIGTJDw \u2014 Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) October 29, 2019\n\n1:45 p.m.: Former Patriots cornerback Aqib Talib reportedly is coming back to the AFC East.\n\nTrade: Rams are trading CB Aqib Talib AND a fifth-round pick to Miami for a future pick, per source. \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) October 29, 2019\n\n1:40 p.m.: Could we see a Jets fire sale before the deadline? Safety Jamal Adams reportedly is a possible trade candidate...\n\nThe hot name right now is Jamal Adams. It wouldn't shock me if he gets dealt. #Jets \u2014 Rich Cimini (@RichCimini) October 29, 2019\n\nKnowing the #Jets are open to dealing several of their big-name players, the #Cowboys have touched base with them on a possible deal for #Jets S Jamal Adams, sources say. He's indicated he's open to a move. Compensation would be massive. \u2014 Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) October 29, 2019\n\n1:10 p.m.: An O.J. Howard trade is looking less likely, per NFL Media's Ian Rapoport ... but the Patriots reportedly are still in the hunt.\n\nOn NFL Network, @RapSheet says as of now, the Buccaneers are not expected to deal TE O.J. Howard.

Not sure if the Bengals will relax the price enough to trade him. \u2014 Jeff Howe (@jeffphowe) October 29, 2019\n\n1:03 p.m.: According to The Athletic's Connor Hughes, the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans both have interest in Le'Veon Bell.\n\nFrom my understanding, talking to sources, #Jets aren't shopping LeVeon Bell as much as teams are calling them. They heard fire sale, and phoned Douglas to see price.\n\n\n\nIs there a price? Yes. It's high. #Chiefs & #Texans most interested. Chiefs have more to possibly get it done\n\n\n\n\u2014 Connor Hughes (@Connor_J_Hughes) October 29, 2019\n\n12:52 p.m.: In related news, the Falcons reportedly are replacing Bryant with Younghoe Koo, who spent time on the Patriots' practice squad earlier this season.\n\nFalcons announced they agreed to terms with K Younghoe Koo. https://t.co/tGd48CbpzV \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) October 29, 2019\n\n12:45 p.m.: We have kicker news!

Howard.\n\n11 a.m.: Our own Tom E. Curran is reporting the Patriots are unlikely to be very busy ahead of the 4 p.m. deadline. Unless...\n\n8:15 a.m.: The Patriots are all set at cornerback, and it sounds like the Detroit Lions and New York Giants aren't budging on their own star corners, per NFL Network's Mike Garafolo.\n\nFrom @gmfb: The #Lions' asking price for CB Darius Slay has remained incredibly high so I don't see him getting traded today, nor has there been any indication #Giants CB Janoris Jenkins is on the move. #NFLTradeDeadline #AsOfRightNow pic.twitter.com/7mMEPkvAaP \u2014 Mike Garafolo (@MikeGarafolo) October 29, 2019\n\nTuesday, Oct. 29, 7:25 a.m.: Happy trade deadline day! CBS Sports' Jason La Canfora provides a handy look at the biggest names who could be traded Tuesday, as well as his predictions for where they'll end up. (O.J. Howard to the Patriots, anyone?)\n\nA few hunches on where some of the most-coveted trade options end up - AJ Green/Saints (if CIN ownership accepts reality and relents on trade talks) , Trent Williams/Browns, OJ Howard/Pats, Chris Harris/Eagles, Derek Wolfe/Colts, Des Trufant/Chiefs, Robby Anderson/Jags \u2014 Jason La Canfora (@JasonLaCanfora) October 29, 2019\n\n*****\n\nMonday, Oct. 28, 10:15 p.m.: Amid the Gordon rumors, the Chargers have cut bait with their offensive coordinator...\n\nKen Whisenhunt has been relieved from his duties as offensive coordinator. \u2014 Los Angeles Chargers (@Chargers) October 29, 2019\n\n4:30 p.m.: Could the Los Angeles Chargers deal star running back Melvin Gordon? The Buffalo Bills and Detroit Lions may come calling, according to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler.\n\nSome around league have linked Lions and Bills to Melvin Gordon. Both teams could be in the market for RB help, and Gordon would make sense if Chargers loosen asking price. \u2014 Jeremy Fowler (@JFowlerESPN) October 28, 2019\n\n4:05 p.m.: The 49ers apparently had interest in Sanu before the Patriots traded for him, NBC Sports Bay Area's Matt Maiocco reports.\n\nThe other WR the #49ers were interested in last week was Mohamed Sanu. SF didn't get the sense the #Bengals were all that interested in moving A.J. Green. Plus, SF was wary because of his injuries. They have no idea what kind player he'll be when he's finally able to play. \u2014 Matt Maiocco (@MaioccoNBCS) October 28, 2019\n\n3:58 p.m.: Washington is seeking a first-round pick for Williams, according to the MMQB's Albert Breer.\n\nThe Redskins have begun the process of ascertaining interest across the league. And I'm told the asking price, for right now (and this is obviously subject to change), is a first-round pick. https://t.co/gtkbT3Afum \u2014 Albert Breer (@AlbertBreer) October 28, 2019\n\n3:10 p.m.: It appears Washington offensive tackle Trent Williams is on the market, after all... Might the Patriots have interest?\n\nSources: The #Redskins are now open to dealing star LT Trent Williams. They have begun the process of looking at potential suitors, and the #Browns have been one. Unclear how high they set the asking price, but they'll at least listen. \u2014 Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) October 28, 2019\n\n3:05 p.m.: We have another trade! The 2-5 Cleveland Browns are trading defensive end Genard Avery to the Philadelphia Eagles following their loss to the Patriots, per ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nBrowns traded LB Genard Avery to the Eagles. \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) October 28, 2019\n\n2:30 p.m.: Here's the latest on Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end O.J. Howard, who could be a potential target for the Patriots.\n\nRumors continue to swirl around OJ Howard as a trade candidate. Two weeks ago I was told he wasn't available. I'm now told that the only way the Bucs consider trading him right now is for a substantial offer. Multiple teams have inquired. https://t.co/yiKTDuNqAK \u2014 JennaLaineESPN (@JennaLaineESPN) October 28, 2019\n\n1:45 p.m.: It's been a busy day for New England's competitors in the AFC East...\n\nThe Miami Dolphins have traded running back Kenyan Drake to the Arizona Cardinals, while the New York Jets are shipping defensive end Leonard Williams to the Giants, per ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nThe Dolphins and Jets are a combined 1-12, so it's no surprise they're both selling ahead of the deadline.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
