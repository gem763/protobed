The 22-year-old was on his way to California, set to start a PhD program at Stanford University.\n\nAfter wishing everyone goodbye, Aghajohari rolled his suitcases into the terminal. He handed his passport to a Turkish Airlines officer and placed his luggage on a scale. A moment later, a senior airline official pulled Aghajohari aside and showed him an email, which said it was \u201cstrictly advised\u201d Aghajohari not board the flight. The initials of US Customs and Border Protection were written beneath the message. \u201cIn a few seconds,\u201d Aghajohari said, \u201cI went from being a Stanford student to being seen as a potentially dangerous person.\u201d\n\nAghajohari was one of about 20 students from Iran who were barred from boarding flights to start graduate programs in the United States last month, the majority at campuses in the University of California system. The students were all traveling with valid F-1 student visas issued by the US state department. Most of them were turned away at airports in Iran, while a few were prevented from boarding connecting flights out of Doha and Istanbul. Their cases made headlines around the world.\n\nSince then, the students have been trying to figure out what sparked the last-minute denials, and are reckoning with the financial and psychological toll of being suddenly barred from traveling.\n\nA sudden denial\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s travel ban, which bars Iranians and nationals of six other countries from traveling to the US, does not apply to Iranian students, an exception that factored into the US supreme court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban. In the 2017-18 academic year, more than 12,000 Iranians attended US colleges.\n\nBefore packing their bags for the US last month, the Iranian students had completed expensive and time-consuming university applications and visa processing. When they were turned away, they rushed to book embassy appointments to find out the reason for the sudden denial. There is no US embassy in Iran, so most of them traveled to Yerevan, Armenia, for appointments, some returning to Tehran by bus \u2013 a 24-hour journey \u2013 because they could only afford one-way plane tickets.\n\nAt the embassy, consular officers told the students their visas were revoked. Several students said the officers seemed puzzled by their cases. Most of the students applied for new visas on the spot, filling the same forms and answering the same questions they had been asked several months earlier.\n\nEighteen students found each other online. The first thing they discovered was that, even though most of them were issued visas in June or July, their cases were all updated in the state department\u2019s online tracking system between 27 and 31 August, a few days before the first student\u2019s flight was scheduled. At the time, the students received no email or alert, and the visa statuses on the site remained \u201cissued\u201d. In hindsight, it seemed like more than a coincidence that their cases were updated \u2013 all at once \u2013 just before the airport denials began in early September.\n\nWhile the state department says a visa does not guarantee entry to the US, immigration experts said what happened to the students is unusual. \u201cYou can\u2019t issue F-1 visas and then just summarily cancel them without providing an explanation,\u201d said Paris Etemadi Scott, an attorney at the Pars Equality Center in California.\n\nAn F-1 visa belonging to an Iranian student cancelled at the US embassy in Yerevan.

Lawyers and students wondered if the sudden denials were an act of political retaliation. \u201cI can only speculate that the reason may have more to do with the deteriorating state of US-Iran relations than with anything in the students\u2019 backgrounds,\u201d said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a law professor at Cornell University.\n\nCouples separated by Trump's travel ban put hopes in faulty visa waiver system Read more\n\nOver the past month, universities and advocacy organizations have demanded explanations from the US government. At a meeting last week, state department officials at the US visa office in Washington DC told representatives of the American Immigration Lawyers Association they were \u201cnot aware of the situation at all\u201d, according to the AILA government relations director, Sharvari Dalal-Dheini.\n\nIn the absence of an explanation, lawyers said the mass denials are a betrayal of regulations laid out in the travel ban. \u201cThey claim they are exempting students and then they revoke the visas,\u201d said Dr Leila Golestaneh Austin, the executive director of the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans. \u201cIt goes against what they promised.\u201d\n\nWhen Katie Porter, a California Democratic congresswoman, inquired with the US embassy in Yerevan and got an auto-response the students were all familiar with \u2013 \u201cWe do not have any information to share about your visa status\u201d \u2013 they began to laugh in despair. \u201cIf they are going to answer to the congresswoman like that,\u201d said Mohammadali, a student admitted to UC Irvine, \u201cwe know there will be no help for us.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the state department told the Guardian the department does not discuss the details of individual cases. \u201cVisa applicants are continuously screened, both at the time of their application and afterwards,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nThe costs\n\nThe last-minute denials have had a deep, possibly lasting effect on a group of Iran\u2019s highest-achieving students. In interviews with eight students, they detailed financial losses, career setbacks, lack of housing, illness, stress and anxiety in the weeks following the abrupt cancellations.\n\nNima Abdollahpour. Photograph: Nima Abdollahpour\n\n\u201cWe invested our lives,\u201d said Nima Abdollahpour, who was set to start a PhD at UC Davis. To gain admission to their programs, the students took costly exams to prove their English fluency and academic abilities, and devoted time and money to applying all over the world. Nearly all of them did so knowing they could only afford to enroll in programs that offered them research or teaching assistant positions that would fully fund their studies.\n\nMost of the students are graduates of Sharif University of Technology, Iran\u2019s most prestigious college, which produces some of the world\u2019s leading mathematicians and scientists. Last year, Aghajohari was the top computer engineering student at SUT; another student, admitted to UC Santa Cruz, ranked third out of more than 200,000 students in Iran\u2019s nationwide university entrance exam.\n\nAfter gaining admission, Iranian students go through a demanding visa application process. First, they travel to Ankara or Yerevan to interview for their visas. The applications then go through an extensive vetting process that has reduced the number of approvals in the last two years and lengthened processing times.\n\nShould their visa applications be successful, Iranians \u2013 unlike other students \u2013 are typically granted single-entry visas, meaning they must remain in the US for the duration of their academic program while their family members in Iran are banned from visiting them.\n\nWhen their visas were issued, the students thought they had finally made it. \u201cI thought that was the end,\u201d said S, a 23-year-old admitted to UC Irvine. She turned down offers she had received from programs in Canada and Europe and began making preparations to move to America.\n\n\u2018My suitcases and the packing struggle that went on for a month\u2019 \u2013 S. Photograph: S\n\nS spent $2,500 on plane tickets, university applications and visa fees. Then she paid rent in Irvine for two months, bought furniture online, registered for several scientific symposiums this fall, and paid Qatar Airways for non-refundable excess baggage. S\u2019s sibling, who lives on the east coast of the US, bought a plane ticket to go surprise her in Irvine.\n\nThe financial losses are compounded by the dramatic fall of the Iranian rial over the last six years, largely as a result of US sanctions. Since 2013, the cost of the US dollar against the rial has more than tripled. Students estimated the price of flying from Tehran to Yerevan \u2013 about $100 \u2013 is equal to a month\u2019s wages.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Tehran, Mehran, 24, co-founded an award-winning software company that employs more than 20 people. He had a good life in Tehran, but wanted to pursue a PhD at a top research university in order to improve his company and to give himself the option of starting a teaching career in Iran.\n\nWhen his visa was approved to start a PhD program at a UC campus, he sold his house in Tehran. He also relinquished 40% of his stock options in his company, transferring them to a new manager the company hired to replace him. \u201cThis is something I cannot undo,\u201d he said. As he no longer has a place to stay in Tehran, Mehran has been living with his parents in Mashhad for the past month. \u201cI\u2019m really upset and I\u2019m really weak even in physical health,\u201d he said.\n\nMehran was not the only student to describe physical and psychological symptoms after being blocked from traveling to start his studies. After she was turned away at the Tehran airport, S stayed in bed for days, crying from stress for hours at a time. Nearly a month later, she is still avoiding people. She doesn\u2019t want to keep explaining what happened or be seen as \u201c\u2018that person\u2019 who has failed in something\u201d. Last month, she started taking anxiety medication for the first time.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sharif University of Technology Computer Engineering Department graduation ceremony, Iran 2018. Photograph: Courtesy one of the students barred from traveling\n\nOther students said certain moments have crystallized in their memories. Aghajohari, who was brimming with optimism as he departed for Stanford, recalled the world turning on him the second he was denied at the check-in counter. \u201cEvery passenger was looking at me like I was a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is really hard for me to forget that moment.\u201d\n\nWhile the students continue to wait for answers, fall quarter classes have started without them. Mehran, Abdollahpour, Aghajohari, and S are all staying with their parents in different parts of Iran. Aghajohari spends his days taking his grandmother to chemotherapy appointments and reading novels to get his mind off the visa problems, whenever possible. \u201cMost of the time at home is spent talking about this issue,\u201d he said. \u201cMy parents are very worried about it.\u201d\n\nThe students hope to be in California when the winter quarter begins in January, but are finding it hard to trust the process. Several are looking into programs in other countries. \u201cWe had a lot of dreams about our future,\u201d Abdollahpour said. \u201cNow I think they might not happen.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Some of the students asked to be identified by their first name or initial out of concern for their pending visa applications.", "description": "They had been accepted to prestigious postgraduate programs, many in California, but they got no further than the airport", "authors": ["Caleb Hampton", "Simon Campbell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23f08bb051fd02c94bb03474dec45685b1a42219/0_53_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b86633a76c31feaca4aaa82725120b38", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
