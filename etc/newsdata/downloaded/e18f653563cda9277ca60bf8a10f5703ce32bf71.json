'It's only when you play the semi-final or the final you start to think about that.\n\n'For the players who didn't play it's good for their rhythm and for myself to see that they are fit, that they are good.'\n\nSouthampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl was happy to escape the Etihad without suffering another drubbing, admitting it was about the last place he wanted to go on the back of Friday's result.\n\nThe bad news is his team are back in the east of Manchester again on Saturday in the Premier League.\n\n'Defending was the most important thing,' he said. 'It was a defeat but a reaction after a very difficult evening on Friday. To come here and play against one of the strongest sides on the planet showed the guys were committed.'\n\nCity eased in to the quarter-finals on Tuesday night as they target a third successive title\n\nFriday's tormentors Leicester advanced with a 3-1 win over Burton, who will have no repeat of last season's journey to the semi-finals.\n\nAlso advancing were Everton, 2-0 winners over Watford; Colchester, who won 3-1 at Crawley; and Oxford, who beat Sunderland on penalties after a 1-1 draw.\n\nAttention now switches to Wednesday's fixtures, with three ties to come.\n\nLiverpool host Arsenal, Chelsea take on Manchester United and Aston Villa and Wolves meet in a battle of near neighbours, if not exactly fierce rivals.\n\nThere will be no Granit Xhaka for Arsenal at Anfield, but manager Unai Emery has indicated that is unrelated to the club captain's angry reaction towards supporters who mockingly cheered his substitution against Crystal Palace on Sunday.\n\nInstead Emery will shuffle his pack, as will opposite number Jurgen Klopp, who has included teenager Harvey Elliott in his squad after the 16-year-old completed a 14-day FA ban for using offensive language in a video mocking Tottenham striker Harry Kane.\n\nHarvey Elliott is in the Liverpool squad after serving his 14-day ban handed down by the FA\n\nElliott became the youngest player to start a senior Liverpool match when he played in the last round against MK Dons aged 16 years and 174 days.\n\nAs United travel to Chelsea, much has changed for both sides since the Red Devils opened the season with a 4-0 rout of Frank Lampard's side at Old Trafford.\n\nWhile United have won only four of 13 games since, Lampard's side go into the game having won seven in a row in all competitions.\n\nThe draw for the quarter-finals will follow on Thursday morning, after which Guardiola may or may not allow himself to think about another trip to Wembley in March.", "description": "Though few would bet against Manchester City in a competition in which they have not lost in over three years, Guardiola said he and his players are not yet thinking about a three-peat.", "authors": ["Max Winters For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/07/20363434-0-image-a-5_1572420021083.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
