The Environmental Ministry has not said how many bags remain, only that \u201cmost\u201d of the bags stored there and at another outdoor site in Iitate remain in place.\n\n\u201cThe concentration of radioactive materials is relatively low and has little impact on the environment,\u201d the ministry told Kyodo News, insisting there was no increase in measured radiation either in the area where the bags were stored or in the river itself.\n\nHagibis, the most powerful typhoon to hit Japan in decades, caused flooding in 200 rivers, dropped record rainfall in some areas, and was preceded by a magnitude 5.7 earthquake off the coast of Chiba. At least 74 deaths have been attributed to Hagibis, and rescue teams are still searching for survivors, with 14 people remaining unaccounted for as of Tuesday night. Nearly 10,000 homes were flooded and hundreds of thousands of police, coast guard, firefighters, and auxiliary personnel are participating in the search and rescue effort.\n\nAlso on rt.com Dozens killed as Typhoon Hagibis wreaks flooding and devastation on Japan (PHOTO, VIDEO)\n\nThe catastrophic three-reactor meltdown at Fukushima eight years ago was triggered by a similar environmental disaster, with a simultaneous earthquake and tsunami wreaking havoc on northeastern Japan. Japanese authorities have consistently sought to downplay the fallout from the Fukushima disaster and announced earlier this month their plans to \u201cdilute\u201d radioactive wastewater from the plant by dumping it into the ocean when storage capacity is exceeded \u2013 horrifying neighboring countries, fishermen, and environmental advocates.\n\nAlso on rt.com Permission to dock: Russia\u2019s floating nuclear power plant reaches Arctic port it was built for\n\nLike this story?
