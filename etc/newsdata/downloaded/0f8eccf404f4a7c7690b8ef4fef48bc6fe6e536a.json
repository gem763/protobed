Rep. Jim Jordan from Ohio, the top Republican on the Democrat-led House Committee on Oversight and Reform, told reporters:\n\nI was not aware he would show up for additional testimony and I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s the case. \u2026 He maybe here to review his transcript. If he is coming back for additional testimony, that seems a little out of the ordinary, so I would be surprised if that\u2019s the case, but we\u2019ll see.\n\nVolker is reportedly talking to congressional investigators behind closed doors at the same time that Michael McKinley, who served as the senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo before he abruptly resigned last week, is giving his scheduled private deposition in the impeachment probe.\n\nThe Daily Kos noted:\n\nSome sources have suggested that Volker\u2019s appearance is part of a continued effort to review the transcript and release portions of his testimony that seem exculpatory for Trump. But his appearance at the same time as McKinley is scheduled to testify is definitely creating an impression that there may be more going on than just skimming through some recorded text.\n\nOn October 3, Volker gave a deposition in the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe that GOP lawmakers say obliterates the Ukraine-linked quid pro quo allegation at the center of the investigation.\n\nAn intelligence community \u201cwhistleblower\u201d accused U.S. President Donald Trump of leveraging aid to Ukraine in exchange for it investigating Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nThe allegation, denied by Trump and Ukraine, triggered the ongoing impeachment probe.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have demanded that House Democrats release the transcripts of Volker\u2019s October 3 testimony, to no avail.\n\nLindsey Graham (R-SC), the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, last week threatened to call Volker to testify before his panel if the Democrats fail to release the full transcript.\n\nOn Monday, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) said Democrats will eventually release \u201call\u201d the transcripts of testimony provided by impeachment inquiry witnesses, but would not say when.\n\nSo far, House Democrats are conducting the impeachment probe behind closed doors, prompting criticism from Republicans.\n\nGOP lawmakers have accused Democrats of cherry-picking and mischaracterizing bits and pieces of testimony and evidence leaked to the press.\n\nIn written testimony leaked to the press, Volker clearly said the Trump administration was not trying to pressure Ukraine into investigating Biden and his son.\n\nTo support his claim, Volker released text messages of communications between him, other Trump administration officials, and Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s private lawyer.\n\nHouse Democrat leaders, however, released what they described as a \u201csubset\u201d of the texts to argue the complete opposite, saying Volker did play a role in pushing Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nBreitbart News found that House Democrats mischaracterized at least one text to fuel their impeachment agenda.\n\nVolker explicitly told lawmakers in written testimony that he wanted \u201cUkraine [to] do nothing that could be seen as interfering in the 2020 elections.\u201d\n\nThe Democrat-led House Committees on Oversight and Reform, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs are conducting the impeachment investigation.", "description": "Former U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker made an unexpected return to the Capitol on Wednesday after testifying in...", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/kurt-volker-capital-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
