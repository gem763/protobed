A couple of highlights: goses and sour ales (and the odd pilsner) from Arizona Wilderness and the Rare Barrel at the Partisan (Tuesday); Brettanomyces-forward wild and sour ales from Crooked Stave, Cascade, and Wolves and People at the Sovereign (Wednesday); dank IPAs and sour ales from Burley Oak at the Red Apron at Union Market (Thursday); and, on the night before Snally, a hop-forward night with Bissell Brothers, Tired Hands, the Veil and Cloudwater at ChurchKey (Friday). Beer at all of these events is limited, so early arrival is suggested. Times and locations vary.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWednesday, Oct. 9\n\nWords & Pictures at Penn Social: You probably have a hefty list of books you want to read, but are any of the titles on that list a graphic novel? If not, let three of the most notable names in the form talk about the role and power of the graphic novel, and maybe persuade you to pick one up. Maryland-native Ebony Flowers, MacArthur fellow Gene Luen Yang and \u201cLa Borinque\u00f1a\u201d creator Edgardo Miranda-Rodriguez will be in conversation with cartoonist Scott McCloud, who\u2019s best known for his trilogy of nonfiction books dissecting comics as an art form. 7 to 8:30 p.m. $15.\n\nP-Lo at Songbyrd: In Bay Area parlance, P-Lo\u2019s music slaps. The co-founder and chief producer of East Bay rap collective the HBK Gang is one of the architects, alongside collaborators Iamsu and Sage the Gemini, of a cottage industry of post-hyphy party music. The crew\u2019s sound has lit up functions on the West Coast and beyond, and has cropped up in songs by YG and Kehlani. As a solo artist, P-Lo\u2019s thick bass lines, skeleton drums and back-to-basics lyrics animate his new album \u201cShine,\u201d an acronym for \u201cSomeHow It Never Ends.\u201d When P-Lo is on the boards or on the mic, the party never does. 8 p.m. $16-$18.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThursday, Oct. 10\n\nRachel Bloom at the Anthem: Since the CW\u2019s \u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend\u201d ended its four-season run in April, fans have been wondering what star and co-creator Rachel Bloom would do next. So has she: Bloom is on her \u201cWhat Am I Going to Do With My Life Now?\u201d tour, which may or may not spell out her career path. It will showcase new stand-up material and some of the acclaimed songs she wrote for the musical comedy series, which was beloved for how it tackled mental illness. We do know one thing that\u2019s for sure in Bloom\u2019s (and her husband\u2019s) future: a baby. 8 p.m. $39.50-$75.\n\nFall for the Book at George Mason University: George Mason University\u2019s three-day book festival always brings a wide and interesting array of authors and speakers to the Fairfax campus. Highlights include New York Times reporter Mike Isaac talking about his new book, \u201cSuper Pumped: The Battle for Uber,\u201d Thursday at noon and authors Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (\u201cWe Should All Be Feminists\u201d) and R.O. Kwon (\u201cThe Incendiaries\u201d) discussing their works Friday. Nearly all events are free and do not require tickets, but capacity is limited. Through Saturday. Most events are free.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHelena Hauff at U Street Music Hall: When it came time to name her most recent album, Helena Hauff played with the duality of the title \u201cQualm\u201d \u2014 not just the English meaning, but the word in her native German tongue (pronounced \u201ckvalm\u201d) that means \u201csmoke\u201d or \u201cfumes.\u201d The DJ-producer makes metal machine music that is heavy on both unease and the ethereal, with drum machine skitters and synthesizer squelches that recall underground dance music from the 1980s. On the album, she tried \u201cto create something powerful without using too many instruments and layers,\u201d according to a news release, and her DJ sets also use the minimal for maximum effect. 11 p.m. $10-$25.\n\nShaed at 9:30 Club: Shaed\u2019s rise to the top was a marathon rather than a sprint. After the Maryland electro-pop trio released its sleek breakout single \u201cTrampoline\u201d in June 2018, it took a full rotation around the sun before the song bounced to No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Alternative Songs chart and entered the Hot 100 chart this summer. These achievements were followed by appearances on morning and late-night talk shows that further launched it into orbit. Now, just seven months after selling out U Street Music Hall, Shaed returns to the District as a fully realized pop act headlining its biggest hometown gig yet at the 9:30 Club. 7 p.m. Sold out.\n\nFriday, Oct. 11\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFall Wine Festival at Mount Vernon: Fall is wine harvest season, but if you prefer to spend more time exploring regional wines than sitting in the car on the way to a vineyard, you might want to choose a wine festival over a wine tour. Case in point: the Fall Wine Festival at Mount Vernon. Now in its 23rd year, the three-day event hosts 19 wineries from around the commonwealth, each of which brings four to six different wines. (That\u2019s a lot of tasting to be done.) The evening also includes live music, a picnic (food costs extra), and tours of Mount Vernon and the wine cellar, plus a meet-and-greet with George and Martha Washington. 6 to 9 p.m. through Sunday. $42-$48.\n\n[Summer is finally over. It\u2019s time to shoot pumpkins, sip cider and tour area farms.]\n\nYardfest at Howard University: Howard University celebrates its homecoming this weekend, which means clubs and bars are going to be packed with students, alumni and curious onlookers who want to bask in the aura that surrounds the festivities. The centerpiece, musically, is Yardfest, a free concert on the campus\u2019s main quad. Over the years, it has featured surprise appearances by Drake, Jay-Z, Kanye West and the Notorious B.I.G., and it has gained a reputation for showcasing up-and-coming hip-hop artists; last year\u2019s featured acts were A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, Lil Baby and Gunna, with Slick Rick appealing to the older alumni. While the lineup isn\u2019t announced until the last minute, attendance at Yardfest is usually a gamble worth taking. Noon. Free.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u2018The Price Is Right Live\u2019 at MGM National Harbor: If you think you\u2019d be pretty good at Plinko, put your money where your mouth is when \u201cThe Price Is Right Live\u201d makes a stop for multiple shows at the Theater at MGM National Harbor. The traveling version (which does not include TV host Drew Carey) of the long-running daytime game show will invite D.C.-area residents to \u201ccome on down\u201d and test their consumer smarts to win prizes and cash. Registration for competitors takes place at the venue starting three hours before showtime. Through Sunday. $35-$60.\n\nSilver Branch Oktoberfest Weekend: Munich\u2019s Oktoberfest ended Sunday, but Washington-area Oktoberfests keep going. Silver Spring\u2019s Silver Branch Brewing, known for its continental-style lagers and ales, launches its first Oktoberfest with a three-day celebration that, at various times, will include the tapping of its Silver Branch M\u00e4rzen beer, live music, German-style food, stein-holding contests, best-dressed contests and family activities on its courtyard patio. Admission is free, though the brewery also offers a $50 \u201cpassport\u201d that includes three liters of beer, a one-liter commemorative mug and an enamel pin. 11 a.m. to midnight. Free admission.\n\nBedouine at Songbyrd: Good music should transport you, so it\u2019s fitting that a faithful interpreter of this theory is Azniv Korkejian, who fashions songs as Bedouine. You could look at Korkejian\u2019s nomadic life and find the inspiration for the name \u2014 she was born to Armenian parents in Syria, spent her childhood in Saudi Arabia and immigrated to the United States \u2014 but instead tune your ears toward the missives in her latest album, \u201cBird Songs of a Killjoy,\u201d and join her on a journey. Korkejian\u2019s songs are folk-inspired (the timbre of her voice can also evoke Brazilian bossa nova troubadours) and radiate a calming warmth that sends you closer toward bliss. 8 p.m. $15-$17.\n\n\u2014 Hau Chu, Fritz Hahn, Adele Chapin, Chris Kelly and Stephanie Williams\n\nAD", "description": "Try your hand at \"The Price is Right,\" hear famous authors at the Fall for the Book Festival and celebrate hip-hop at Howard's annual homecoming Yardfest,", "authors": ["Going Out Guide Staff"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/X6iQPikW6pspymeU2lMdm1pG7oQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DLFDNRGXKMI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
