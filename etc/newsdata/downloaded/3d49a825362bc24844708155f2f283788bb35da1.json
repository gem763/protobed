He will now table a motion to call an election, however it is unclear whether Labour will play along. Do they fall into the 'elephant trap', or do they prefer to watch the new Tory regime implode? With rebels having the whip withdrawn the government benches are now very much in the minority.\u201d\n\nLate Tuesday, Johnson lost his majority of one in parliament after MP Phillip Lee defected to the Liberal Democrats. In a surprise move, Lee announced his defection while John was delivering a speech in the House of Commons.\n\nLosing the majority means that if Johnson tries to push through a motion, even if all Tory members agreed to back him, it wouldn\u2019t get enough votes to get it through parliament.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, Johnson then launched the bid for an early general election \u2014 which would mark the third election and potentially a fourth prime minister for Britain in four years if he loses.\n\nThis came after he suffered a brutal defeat at the hands of MPs trying to block a no-deal Brexit.\n\nMPs voted to take control of the House of Commons agenda, meaning they can now look to prevent the PM from taking the UK out of the EU without a deal in place.\n\nJohnson accused Parliament of being \u201con the brink of wrecking any deal\u201d with the EU after the result was announced.\n\nA total of 21 Conservatives rebelled against their party, despite warnings they will be expelled from the party and prevented from standing in future elections.\n\nWhy is the pound moving upwards when there\u2019s a possible general election?\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

The movement of people between Britain and EU countries would also be unclear.\n\nFormer prime minister Theresa May, who backed the campaign to Remain in the EU before the 2016 referendum, sealed a deal with the bloc but was repeatedly shut down by MPs in and outside her party. She managed to survive as Conservative party leader and prime minister for nearly three years but was eventually ousted by agreeing to step down and opening up the premiership to someone else.\n\nIn the end, Johnson won the Conservative party leadership race and, by default, became the next prime minister after being voted by Tory party members only.\n\nREAD MORE: Fears for UK economy as construction suffers sharpest slide in a decade", "description": "There also could be another general election in October \u2014 two weeks before the Brexit deadline.", "authors": ["Lianna Brinded", "Head Of Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/A2erNe02ikIwXnJIJvKlIw--~B/aD00MDAwO3c9NjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/ffd464e0-cedb-11e9-aabb-b37bbb1a1caf"}
