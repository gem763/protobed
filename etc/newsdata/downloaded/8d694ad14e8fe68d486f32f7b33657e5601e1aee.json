I wasn't having that.\"\n\nLauren Mahon was just 31 when doctors told her she had breast cancer. She never thought she would get it because of her \"tiny rack\", but went to the doctors after finding a painful lump in her boob just to be on the safe side.\n\nEight gruelling rounds of chemo, surgery and radiotherapy later, Lauren has made it her mission to get women everywhere checking their boobs.\n\nHer incredible approach and attitude towards the disease has led to her raising more than \u00a360,000 for charity with funny t-shirts.\n\nIt's also helped make her podcast You, Me & The Big C, which she worked on alongside Rachael Bland, who passed away last year, and Deborah James, a huge success.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nSpeaking to Mirror Online as part of the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Breast Cancer Campaign to mark Breast Cancer Awareness month, Lauren admits she knew very little about the disease before she went through it.\n\nShe went to a walk-in clinic as she hadn't yet registered with a GP after finding a painful lump on her boob.\n\nShe waited a month to check it wasn't just a normal change caused by her menstrual cycle, but when it didn't go away decided it was time to get it checked.\n\n\"People say breast cancer doesn't hurt, but that's a lie.\"\n\nA few weeks later she was told she had breast cancer.\n\n\"It was terrifying. All I knew about cancer was that both my grandparents had died from it.\n\n\"I just thought I would be in a hospital bed and I wouldn't be able to move.\n\n\"You just get told you've got cancer and that's it. It takes a long time to accept it.\n\n\"I didn't think I could get breast cancer because I've got a small rack, but that's the one that came for me.\n\n\"You go through a bereavement. It's a bereavement for the life you've got because things are about to get very different very quickly.\"\n\nShe decided to have her eggs frozen before starting chemotherapy as she knew it would make her infertile.\n\nLauren then underwent eight gruelling rounds of chemo, surgery and radiotherapy.\n\n\"It's really tough. Your whole body just really aches. My bones would ache with fury.\n\n\"You feel horrific for two weeks, then you feel yourself again, then you've got to find the mental strength to go back and do it again.\n\n\"It takes a lot to go back in that chair when you know how bad it is.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\"I always thought I was quite soft inside and weak.\n\n\"I didn't realise my brain could go to that place and get through all these things.\"\n\nDetermined to not only see the negatives, Lauren jokes about some of the surprising advantages.\n\n\"You're dolphin smooth. You don't have a hair on your body. The amount of money I saved on waxing. That's a big cancer perk.\"\n\nShe started putting details of her treatment on Instagram with the hashtag #GirlVsCancer to keep friends and family updated.\n\n\"Everyone is all up in your grill when you get sick. There's a lot of pressure to answer everyone's questions.\"\n\nAs it grew in popularity Lauren used the platform to raise money and has since more than \u00a361,000 with her t-shirt range.\n\n\"It was all for the love of getting people to get to know their breasts. I don't want people to feel pity, I want them to feel empowered.\n\n\"I want to take away the fear of cancer because I think it stops people from going to get checked.\"\n\nBut the thing she is the most proud of her podcast Me, You and the Big C.\n\nSet up by the BBC's Rachael Bland, the revolutionary podcast saw the three women talking openly and honest about cancer.\n\nWhen Rachael passed away in September last year, Lauren and Deborah did everything they could to keep her message going.\n\n\"It is the greatest legacy she could have left. She knew what she was doing. That's why we were everywhere.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"We had been instructed by the captain to do so.\n\n\"It has completly changed the way people talk about the disease.\n\n\"It's something that we are all incredible proud of.\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, Lauren found Rachael's death extremely difficult.\n\n\"It was sh*t. I don't feel like I've ever processed her death.\"\n\nSpeaking during Breast Cancer Awareness Week, Lauren wants every woman to get into the habit of checking their boobs every month.\n\n(Image: Est\u017de Lauder Companies Breast Cancer Campaign)\n\n\"What are the reasons you're not doing it? You have to take responsibility.\n\n\"If you're going to find something it's not going to go away. The best thing you can do for yourself is to do something about it.\n\n\"The ball is in your court, don't be afraid.\"\n\nHow to check your boobs\n\nAs part of the campaign, TV doctor Dr Zoe Williams has stressed how important it is for women to check their boobs every month.\n\nShe says there is no right or wrong way to check, and everyone is different.\n\n(Image: Est\u017de Lauder Companies Breast Cancer Campaign)\n\nGetting to know your boobs is what is important so you notice anything new or any changes.\n\nThe important thing to remember is to make sure you also check your nipples, your armpit and right up to your collarbobe.\n\nDr Zoe said: \"We must change this and make it the norm. Women should be encouraging other women to talk more openly about their breasts across generations in their community, including their mum, grandmother, auntie, sister, or friend, to really inspire conversations around the importance of breast health, self-checking, and simply supporting those who might be unsure of what to look for.\n\n\"Any changes that are found should be presented to their GP. While it\u2019s likely not to be anything serious, earlier diagnosis and treatment will improve chances of survival.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Lauren Mahon, who was on the revolutionary podcast You, Me & The Big C, has raised tens of thousands of pounds for charity with her funny t-shirts", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Est\u017ee Lauder Companies Breast Cancer Campaign", "Bbc", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20583591.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Breast-Cancer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
