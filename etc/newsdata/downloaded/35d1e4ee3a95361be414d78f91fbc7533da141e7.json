Tasking the entire cast with hanging onto the secret of who won for months. Flying everyone back home to Australia to pretend like they know absolutely nothing, and expecting that result to miraculously never leak. Why would they do that? Why would they commit to shooting a full season of Survivor at 100% production values and then pull their punch right at the end?\n\nThen, like a damned Immunity Torch sprung back to life, it hit me: They didn\u2019t do the live finale because that would require the entire jury to be present in-studio. Which they couldn\u2019t do, because the entire jury isn\u2019t in Australia right now.\n\nSpecifically: Harry isn\u2019t in Australia right now.\n\nHarry is in Fiji, filming Australian Survivor: All Stars. They couldn\u2019t shoot the ending live, because they knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to be there for it. He\u2019s already back in the jungle.\n\nThe All Stars series was announced \u201cofficially\u201d last night following the conclusion of this year\u2019s season finale, but the reality is it\u2019s been in the works for quite some time.\n\nWhen it became apparent to production crews just how good this season of Survivor would be, Channel Ten reportedly bosses made the decision to rush a new season into production. Host Jonathan LaPaglia sneakily revealed that his work schedule featured two seasons of Survivor filming in 2019 in an interview with News.com.au that mysteriously removed the offending quote not long after publishing it in July.\n\nGiven the wet season in Fiji lasts from December through til April, it\u2019s heavily speculated that All Stars is actually being shot as we speak. That\u2019s had weight added to it thanks to the Australian Survivor Instagram account, whose bio is now promising that All Stars will arrive in \u201cearly 2020,\u201d not midway through the year like the current season.\n\nBut the plot thickens further: Every jury member voted out has been given media duty the following day. All of them, except Harry.\n\nBaden has been paraded around media circles this morning, including an appearance on Studio 10.\n\nPia Miranda took out this year's title of Sole Survivor, but how's runner-up Baden doing now? He joins us to unpack the massive #SurvivorAU finale! ???? #Studio10 pic.twitter.com/ZFdJLd7nXP \u2014 Studio 10 (@Studio10au) September 18, 2019\n\nPia meanwhile has spoken to a raft of media organisations, including me, right here, at PEDESTRIAN.TV. And I can sure as hell confirm that wasn\u2019t an International number she phoned in from either.\n\nHarry though? A ghost. Absolutely nowhere to be found. Not a peep from him anywhere. Which is very odd at bare minimum.\n\nLastly, there\u2019s the biggest tell-tale sign of all: Harry\u2019s Instagram.\n\nThe last time Harry posted a candid photo on his account was back in early August. Since then it\u2019s been nothing but memes. Memes someone else could quite easily have been posting to fulfil a social media contractual obligation to the current season. The attached captions do little more than promote the show with a very Social Media Department-feeling gag alongside.\n\nOther players like Luke, John, Abbey, David, Shaun, Janine, and even Ross have been flat out posting Instagram stories over the past twelve hours showing either behind-the-scenes titbits or candid shots of them watching the finale.\n\nOn Harry\u2019s account? Nothing. Not a peep.\n\nBecause Harry\u2019s not in control of the account right now.\n\nHarry\u2019s back in Fiji, shooting All Stars.\n\nThat\u2019s my theory, and I\u2019m sticking to it.", "description": "Australian Survivor not doing a live finale last night was a baffling choice, until I realised it's because they're already shooting a new season.", "authors": ["Cam Tyeson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/harry-survivor-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
