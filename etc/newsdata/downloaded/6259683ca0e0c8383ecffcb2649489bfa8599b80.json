It\u2019s a growth area and what today might seem like over the top will be good value down the line.\u201d\n\nFour buyers registered for the auction but only two took an active part \u2014 an investor and a couple hoping to occupy the property.\n\nAuctioneer Michael Carolan said there was a \u201cnervous\u201d energy at the start of the sale but this quickly disappeared once the bidders had made a few offers.\n\nThe bids went up in initial increments of $25,000 before slowing to $20,000 and $10,000 increases once bidding passed the $2 million mark.\n\nThe investor was the more aggressive of the bidders, attempting a knockout bid of $2.3 million after the couple offered $2.26 million. It didn\u2019t deter the couple initially, but when a later $2.25 million bid was upped by $10,000 they declared themselves out of contention for the home and the investor was declared the new owner.\n\nThe property was one of nearly 540 Sydney homes to go under the hammer yesterday in what was a more subdued day for sales compared to last weekend when there more than 700 auctions.\n\nIn nearby inner west suburb Lewisham, a five-bedroom Queen Anne Federation house on Gould Ave sold under the hammer for $2.731 million, beating the reserve price by $431,000.\n\nAuctioneer and selling agent Shad Hassen of The Agency-Inner West said the auction was competitive from the start.\n\nThe opening bid was $2.6 million, well above the $2.3 million price guide. Two more buyers put their hands up to bid, but the opening bidder emerged victorious.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful home and we had a full backyard of people coming to see the auction,\u201d Mr Hassen said.\n\nMr Hassen had earlier in the day sold a three-bedroom terrace in Petersham, dropping the hammer at $1.75 million, $200,000 over reserve.\n\nThe reserve for the house on Terminus St was $1.55 million and the price guide was $1.5 million to $1.6 million. The buyers were a local family.\n\n\u201cThe home is in a row of terraces within one of Petersham\u2019s best pockets,\u201d Mr Hassen said. \u201cFew properties ever come up for sale there.\u201d\n\nMORE: How renters are saving $150 per week\n\nStrathfield mansion has life-size cow\n\nBut not all sellers beat their reserves at auction. A luxury home on Northcote Rd in Glebe passed in on a vendor bid of $3.6 million after attracting the interest of five registered bidders.\n\nThere was a crowd of about 80 people there to watch the auction and selling agency Belle Property-Annandale said the home would likely sell in a post-auction negotiation.", "description": "They offered a rundown home on a small block for their neighbourhood, but the sellers of a Sydney fixer upper managed to walk away with an unlikely multimillion-dollar price at auction today.", "authors": ["Aidan Devine"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/19131046/capi_b13a1a5bcf493bc62d095549b957b01e_a1e2327be3ee63a26c734ff43a661433.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
